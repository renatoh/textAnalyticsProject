His welcome to England was to be yanked down in the penalty area by Bolton's Kevin Nolan. The point of the history lesson is that teams are not static entities. They churn and evolve. Among the next stops for the players listed above were Celtic, Real Madrid, Newcastle, Everton and Arsenal. The difference this time is that United have lost a Fifa world player of the year, who has scored 68 times in the past two seasons, for a record \u00a380m. The scale is vastly altered, but the principle of self-renewal is unchanging. One other distinction characterises Ronaldo's move to Madrid, via Paris Hilton's LA boudoir, if the gossip sheets are to be believed. For the first time in 23 years, Ferguson is not master of his own destiny. Eric Cantona's sudden retirement deprived the great dictator of the power to decide his French maestro's leaving date. Otherwise, Old Trafford legends are almost always fired over the ramparts from the boss's cannon. Keane, expelled. David Beckham, cast out. Van Nistelrooy, ejected. Jaap Stam, banished. Paul Ince, evicted. Remember, though, Ferguson pretty much knew Ronaldo was on his way this time last year, when he was held back for a season as a kind of face-saving measure. United's leader has had 12 months to consider how the side would be reshaped when Ronaldo skipped away. As a betting man, though, Ferguson will have noticed bookmakers lengthening the odds on United retaining their Premier League title to 7-4 from 11-8. In the Champions League, United have shifted a point to 6-1. But the absurdities of the betting market are illustrated by Chelsea's sudden tightening-up for the Premier League crown from 7-2 to 5-2. Has the potentially disruptive Carlo Ancelotti factor suddenly disappeared just because Ronaldo has left \u2013 a sale that leaves United \u00a380m richer? To say great teams are never improved by the auctioning off of their best player is a truism. But even if the gains are insufficient to outweigh the loss, they are still substantial. In a sense, United have lost two players: Rocket Ronny the winger and Ronaldo the central striker and dead-ball artiste. The free-kick gap is hard to fill. But a replacement centre-forward is already in the building and yanking at his chain. Wayne Rooney, who has now scored as many times for England as Sir Geoff Hurst and is nearly halfway to Sir Bobby Charlton's record (49), came clean in Kazakhstan and declared he is a much better player through the middle than he is out on the left wing. Nature may abhor one, but footballers love a vacuum. Rooney will feel a surge of liberation. He lacks the narcissistic tendency to want fame's light to suddenly fall on him. He will, though, covet Ronaldo's central role: the one Real's new No9 moaned about having to occupy after the Champions League final in Rome. Lyon's Karim Benzema, whom Ferguson is known to admire greatly, may seem to present a problem of duplication because he shares some of Rooney's pace, strength and directness \u2013 but he is also blessed with a special presence that United would dearly like to acquire, regardless of how the Carlos Tevez-Dimitar Berbatov conundrum resolves itself. Berbatov, the languid maverick in the Alice band, knows, from the end-of-season team selections, that he has dropped below the application level demanded of a United aristocrat. The assumption is that he will be given another season to put that right. The Tevez saga, which is straining the word-carrying capacities of even the worldwide web, is inseparable from the post-Ronaldo calculation about how best to rebuild. It is also bound up with the United board's long-standing reluctance to write a \u00a325m cheque to a middleman on top of the \u00a310m loan fee they have already paid. Out wide, others are queuing to step into the void. Ronaldo's underachieving compatriot, Nani, thrust up his arm just as Antonio Valencia's move from Wigan Athletic, for around \u00a315m, began to seem a certainty. \"Ronaldo was a very important player for us, but my opportunity has come,\" Nani told a Portuguese newspaper. \"The time has come for Manchester United to put their trust in me.\" The Latics are an unlikely raiding ground for a club who have just lost an \u00a380m superstar to Real Madrid, but there has been a shift in emphasis at Old Trafford in the past four years towards finding sub-23-year-olds who can be shaped in the club's image. Valencia is 23, Benzema 21. The United academy staff spent many months pursuing the Brazilian brothers Da Silva, Rafael and F\u00e1bio, and also hit pay dirt with the Italian Federico Macheda, who has the pure talent and self-assurance to fill some of the gap left up front by Ronaldo. Since the world's No1 player is, by definition, irreplaceable, United's policy will be to be supplant him with a range of talents, starting with Rooney and Valencia, and completing the job with a Benzema, Samuel Eto'o or Franck Rib\u00e9ry, although Bayern Munich's mirth-inducing asking price will evoke memories for Ferguson of the tedious and expensive pursuit of Owen Hargreaves. United's lost midfield stopper brings tacticians to a vital point about Ronaldo's dash to Spain. Go back to the defining game that the English champions lost in 2008-09 and all roads lead to Rome. Barcelona's scintillating artistry aside, United surrendered the Champions League final meekly because the formation was wrong, the match-winners, including Ronaldo, went awol after Barcelona's first goal and they lacked an authentic holding midfielder to engage and disrupt Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi. Hence the talk of Ferguson sizing-up Bar\u00e7a's Yaya Tour\u00e9 or another defensive midfielder to play the Roy Keane role. Doubts persist over Hargreaves's capacity to beat chronic knee trouble and Michael Carrick is a passing midfielder press-ganged into a screening job. Which just leaves Darren Fletcher, suspended for the game in Rome. United are light in the defensive midfield area and Ronaldo's departure provides Ferguson with a chance to rectify that shortfall. A superficial reading is that United need to make some kind of international statement by signing a global household name, as if football were merely a game of grand gestures and prestige. For them, this summer is a process of manpower adjustment and tactical realignment. How much more stardust can be extracted from Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs? Will Anderson progress? Will Hargreaves ever return? Did the brutal exposure of Park Ji-sung's limitations at the very highest level point to the need to move him on or merely reaffirm that he is a valuable Premier League workhorse rather than a Champions League thoroughbred? More salient even than the broader personnel issues is that Ronaldo was a captive whose egocentricity was in danger of turning into dry rot in the House of Ferguson. He was well down the path to becoming a destructive influence before his sulk in Rome raised fresh doubts about his character. Only the most incurable prima donnas turn Champions League finals into private dramas. Most great players submit, however unwillingly, to the collective nature of the task. Ex-United players seldom thrive elsewhere, although Gerard Piqu\u00e9 has at Barcelona. Ronaldo is unlikely to fall down the Lee Sharpe memorial well for self-fancying wide boys. But nor is United's loss remotely terminal. Recruitment and regeneration are one of the prime measures of managerial nous. The main one, some say. United's other acquisitions around the time of Ronaldo were Kleberson, Howard, David Bellion and Eric Djemba-Djemba. United made their greatest discovery since Eric Cantona in one of their worst summers for overall talent spotting. Then there was Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n: irrefutable proof, some said, that Ferguson's eye for brilliance had gone milky. La Brujita (Little Witch) played his last minutes for United in the season before Ronaldo made his debut, and fell over in the box with Nolan's hand tugging at his shirt. Through all these stories of triumphant recruitment and the odd aberration, there is a theme of renewal, of constant, grinding evolution that will fill the heads of United fans with endless permutations and dreams this summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
