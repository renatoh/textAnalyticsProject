As he prepared to take his team back to Anfield on Saturday Poyet returned to the subject and an opinion which has appeared increasingly sensible since the Uruguay striker\u2019s departure for Barcelona. \u201cPeople were very upset with me last year when I said that,\u201d said Poyet. \u201cA few hate me. But I was not going against Liverpool and Steven Gerrard, who is one of the icons of English football, it\u2019s just that I knew how good Luis is. He\u2019s so good he makes a difference. It\u2019s the same with Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo or Sergio Ag\u00fcero.\u201d While Sunderland\u2019s manager hopes to capitalise on Liverpool\u2019s ongoing, and still painful, transition to life after Su\u00e1rez he has sympathy for Rodgers, who has found himself under pressure this season, in the wake of last term\u2019s second-place finish. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a strange atmosphere at Anfield this year and we can make it a little stranger,\u201d said Poyet. \u201cBecause what they did last year was so spectacular, so very special, expectations this season were a little bit out of proportion. Everyone was expecting them to be in the top two again and to be close to winning the Champions League but it\u2019s not that easy. They are getting there but I think it\u2019s going to be a slow process and not as quick as people think, especially when they keep changing players.\u201d Despite Poyet pointing out that Sunderland have \u201cmissed Fabio Borini and his goals a lot\u201d, his board have ruled out the possibility of making a renewed bid for the Italian next month. After Borini\u2019s successful loan stint at the Stadium of Light last season a \u00a314m fee was agreed with Liverpool in July but the forward dug his toes in and refused to leave Anfield. Despite being given little more than a fringe role by Rodgers so far this season, Borini is said to have no regrets about that decision. \u201cI hope Fabio doesn\u2019t play against us,\u201d said Poyet, before urging travelling supporters not to jeer a player they feel let down by. \u201cIf he does play I hope our fans will give him a terrific reception. We never wanted to say \u2018goodbye\u2019 to Fabio but he is not here any more and so it\u2019s a good opportunity for us to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to him. I had a top-class relationship with Fabio and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing him and having a nice chat.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
