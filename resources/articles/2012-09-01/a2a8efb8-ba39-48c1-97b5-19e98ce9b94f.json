The equivalent event at the Olympics had felt slightly underwhelming, perhaps because no spectacle could possibly live up to the athletic spectacles that had preceded it, partly because the air of mystery surrounding what was going to take place led people to expect a surprise that never actually came: if you'd listened to the wild talk of appearances by David Bowie and Kate Bush and holograms of Freddie Mercury, it was hard not to be even more disappointed when it became apparent what you were actually going to get was Jessie J. The latter issue was circumvented here by announcing who was going to be performing in advance. Nevertheless, you didn't have to be one of those people who thinks Coldplay are the cloven-hoofed musical emissaries of satan himself to have been slightly concerned about how appropriate a booking they were. On one hand, they are one of the biggest bands in the world \u2013 a suitably global success for a global event \u2013 they stir vast stadiums full of people for a living, and it is a churlish character that claims they are anything other than very good at it. On the other, the key piece of music at the Paralympic opening ceremony \u2013 the track that seemed to hit on something vital about the Games to come \u2013 was Orbital and the Graeae Theatre Company's retooling of Ian Dury's Spasticus Autisticus, a song that is brutal, startling, furious and many other things that Coldplay's music are not. Thanks to their ubiquity on TV soundtracks \u2013 tinkling away as someone departs The X Factor or the DIY SOS tells their tragic back story \u2013 a lot of their songs have become musical shorthand for \"oh, isn't it a pity\", designed to elicit sympathy for whoever is on screen. The Paralympics have incited a vast array of emotions in viewers, but pity isn't among them, as anyone who caught a glimpse of the frankly terrifying wheelchair rugby will attest. As it turned out, their set got better the more upbeat it became: the triumphant arena-filling guitar riff of Charlie Brown seemed to fit the event more than the more ponderous ballads, while it would take an effort almost as superhuman as the athletes had put in over recent days not to be moved by their collaboration with the Paraorchestra on Strawberry Swing, -\u2013 one of their loveliest songs, its melody boasting a subtlety that the bands' detractors would have you believe they don't possess \u2013 or the crowd singing along with Viva La Vida while fireworks exploded and confetti fluttered from above. The staging meanwhile, felt noticeably darker, less cosy and self-congratulatory than the Olympic closing ceremony. There was a lot of stuff with fire and steampunk costumes, rusty vehicles cannibalised from old cars and farm machinery and people pretending to be crows on stilts. A seasoned festival-goer might note that it all had a whiff of the kind of thing you see at 3am in the outlying fields at Glastonbury: a definite improvement on the Olympic closing ceremony, which carried a whiff of a bad night at the Brits. In the event that you felt bored by Coldplay, there was always something to distract your attention: ice skating, high-wire artists dangling from motorbikes, aerialists twirling from bunches of oversized light bulbs that sprayed out fire, people running out of the mouth of a giant fish carrying huge cardboard cutouts of insects on sticks. There was interpretative dance, which was nowhere near as disheartening as interpretative dance to Coldplay looks on paper. The same was true of Rihanna's solo appearance. We Found Love is a decent pop song that's become rather a victim of its own success: one way of giving it some added interest in the teeth of its ubiquity is to have her perform it while flying around the stadium on what looked like a vast garden swing. The other special guest was Jay-Z. With Rihanna and Coldplay, he played Run This Town. Not the most obvious choice, but recontextualized by its surroundings it felt weirdly appropriate: as anyone who visited London during the Games and noted an almost tangible sense of excitement in the air knows, that's precisely what the Paralympics appeared to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
