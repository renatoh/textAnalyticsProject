WHO had warned about risk of Covid-19 in January The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection. Technical guidance notes seen by the Guardian and briefings by top WHO officials warned of potential human-to-human transmission and made clear that there was a threat of catching the disease through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, based on the experience of earlier coronavirus outbreaks. Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d.

The pope said: \u201cThese days more than 60 [priests] have died here in Italy while taking care of the sick, in hospitals. Together with the doctors and nurses they are the saints next door.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
