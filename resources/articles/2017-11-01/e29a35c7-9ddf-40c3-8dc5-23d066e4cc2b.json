He was warned, in no uncertain terms, that if he did not perform in this game of all games he would be in trouble. It is hard to imagine that in the modern game such threats would be part of a pre-match routine, but the words said within the Arsenal camp last week to gee them up for the visit of Tottenham Hotspur certainly had a motivating effect. In the intensity of their play, in their body language, this was a different kind of Arsenal to the one that has a tendency to freeze up and feel the fear creeping in during high-pressure games. They seemed to relish the situation. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn let out some kind of primal roar as he headed down the tunnel at half-time in recognition of a two-goal lead his team would not relinquish. Mesut \u00d6zil at one point hoiked an agricultural clearance 40 yards straight up into the air \u2013 as un-\u00d6zil-esque a technique as you could ever imagine \u2013 to clamourous acclaim. Alexis S\u00e1nchez rediscovered his appetite for careering around the pitch chasing every cause going. One of the key figures in galvanising Arsenal was an unexpected one. Shkodran Mustafi has had a mixed experience since joining the club in the summer of 2016. Some promising performances, some ropey ones, spells out injured, suggestions the German might even move on after one so-so season. Mustafi had been absent for seven weeks before being recalled to the three-man defensive unit that formed the platform for Arsenal to take on a Spurs side generally billed as favourites pre-match. He tackled a vital game as if it mattered to every fibre of his being. Afterwards he contemplated the question that foreign players might not be perceived as caring about a derby as much as locally born counterparts. His no-nonsense reply suggested the old fashioned pin-your-team-mate-against-the-wall routine might chime with his wholehearted personality. \u201cThat\u2019s you guys thinking it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs always \u2013 Arsenal is dead. Arsenal is not coming back. It\u2019s always the same. It\u2019s about what the team is thinking and feeling. We keep saying it that we are always alive, we always believe in ourselves, we always try to give everything on the pitch. Obviously when it comes to games like this you have to show character. We showed a great character, when we had the ball but also when we didn\u2019t have it.\u201d Their efforts without the ball were cranked up and what a difference that made as a foundation for a strong performance. When they got the benefit of some tight calls by the officials they were in the mood to make the most of it. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was particularly complimentary about Mustafi\u2019s influence, vocally as well as his impact reading the game with obvious determination at both ends of the pitch. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader, he\u2019s a motivator,\u201d the manager said. The unit, with Mustafi alongside Laurent Koscielny and Nacho Monreal, snuffed out the attack of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, and Wenger liked the leadership that came from the back. \u201cSometimes one word \u2013 \u2018go a bit more wide, go a bit more left, drop off\u2019 \u2013 makes a complete difference. Because it\u2019s like you have a photo of a team when you play at the back.\u201d Mustafi thinks Arsenal must strive to hit those levels more regularly. \u201cIt\u2019s about being consistent. That\u2019s our goal every day in training because you are only as good as your last game. If you win today and lose next weekend you are back where you were.\u201d Mustafi\u2019s straight-talking was evident as he responded to queries about how close he came to leaving Arsenal during the summer. \u201cYou [reporters] like to get the shit, the biggest shit. That\u2019s your job,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople outside, talking and thinking that they know everything. What happens in the changing room is the real thing. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people just talk about things they cannot know about. If I have been talking to clubs or if I haven\u2019t, it\u2019s only rumours. Obviously there are so many newspapers, they need something to write because it\u2019s boring if the paper is empty.\u201d Having helped the defence to do their job, Mustafi enjoyed how Arsenal\u2019s front trio of S\u00e0nchez, \u00d6zil and Alexandre Lacazette pushed high up the pitch to put their opponents under pressure. How important are Sanchez and \u00d6zil to this team? \u201cYou want everyone to leave, don\u2019t you? We need the players, not everyone can leave. They are big players. Alexis, Mesut, they can create chances and score goals. Obviously everyone in the team wants them to stay here but in the end they choose. It\u2019s their careers and they choose what decision they make.\u201d Emotions ran high on both sides of the north London divide. Mauricio Pochettino aired his frustrations, with officials, himself, and although he is not keen to criticise his team, he did acknowledge they were not at their best. \u201cI am disappointed. When you beat Real Madrid everybody is so happy even though we made a lot of mistakes. It is different when you lose, you are disappointed. But it is not only about criticising the referee. It is about criticising ourselves because we needed to do better.\u201d The predicted power shift in north London remains on hold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
