Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld a complaint by the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) over counting irregularities in the 31 March vote, which was won by an opposition candidate, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, in one of the biggest challenges to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on the country in his 16 years as leader. Istanbul\u2019s residents have been to the polls 13 times since 2002 in general elections, local elections and referenda, and on Sunday they will go again. \u201cThe word election has a new meaning for me now and it is \u2018stress\u2019,\u201d said one voter, Pelin Dinar, 36. \u201cWe have had so many elections and the way that the result [in March] was cancelled means that our belief in fair elections is fading away each time.\u201d Both the public and politicians appear exhausted by the new round of campaigning, but the whole country is aware that the stakes on Sunday are high. Losing control of Turkey\u2019s biggest city and economic heart would be an unacceptable outcome for the AKP. The March result was a personal blow to Erdo\u011fan. The Turkish president was born and raised in Istanbul\u2019s working-class Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa neighbourhood and became the city\u2019s first conservative mayor in 1994. The unprecedented swing of conservative and working-class votes away from the AKP was widely viewed as a rebuke to the president\u2019s handling of Turkey\u2019s economic crisis. The cost of living has been soaring and unemployment stands at 12.7%. The decision to cancel \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s narrow victory was met with outrage by both the opposition and within some factions of the government itself, who said it dented the ruling party\u2019s democratic credentials. The former president Abdullah Gul and the former prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu have both openly criticised the AKP for seeking a rerun, fuelling rumours in Turkish media that the senior AKP politicians are preparing to form breakaway parties. \u201cThe rerun decision \u2026 definitely made the cracks within the AKP more visible,\u201d Can Sel\u00e7uki, general manager of the Istanbul Economics Research thinktank, told the Associated Press. \u201cIf \u0130mamo\u011flu wins, it\u2019s likely those cracks will become even more visible.\u201d The AKP has taken a decidedly different approach to campaigning than last time. In March the campaign was dominated by the president himself. This time Erdo\u011fan has stayed away and the AKP\u2019s mayoral candidate, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m \u2013 a former prime minister and staunch ally of the president \u2013 has come up with several new policies designed to appeal to younger voters and the city\u2019s Kurdish population. In the past few days the president has resurfaced to launch personal attacks on \u0130mamo\u011flu, accusing him of acting in league with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). Despite the AKP\u2019s efforts, however, most polls suggest \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s razor-thin lead of 0.2% over Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m in the March election has since widened. \u0130mamo\u011flu has cast the new election as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy. \u201cThis is not only a local election, it is a battle for democracy,\u201d \u0130mamo\u011flu said in a televised debate with Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m last week. \u201cI am an elected mayor who only served for 18 days [before the vote was cancelled]. This is a struggle against those who have seized the democratic rights of 16 million people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
