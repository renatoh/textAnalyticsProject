Outside the fumigation chambers it hung around, bonded to the tropical north Queensland air, amid the hottest November on record. When Sharman went home, and nursed his baby son to sleep, the odour of the gas was still there. \u201cIt would stick around on my clothes when I\u2019d go home at night,\u201d Sharman recalls. \u201cA garlicky sort of smell. A specific smell, I\u2019ve never smelled it before or since [but] it\u2019s a smell you wouldn\u2019t forget.\u201d Sharman was unemployed in October 1995, when he heard about the discovery of the papaya fruit fly (Bactrocera papayae) in north Queensland and offered to help out. Within days he was on the government payroll, working in a makeshift fumigation tent near Innisfail, disinfesting fruit with ethylene dibromide (EDB). The fumigation chambers were converted PVC tents that routinely leaked. They had no exhaust vents. In the corner, sitting on an old milk crate, was an aluminium electric frypan. \u201cThe sort you use to cook your roast chook on a Sunday,\u201d Sharman says. \u201cYou\u2019d be handed the chemical \u2026 in a five-litre plastic container, unlabelled, like water. We used to pour \u2026 an amount into a beaker, pour it into a frypan and let it boil off. \u201cWe wore shorts and T-shirts. We were told, \u2018Just don\u2019t spill it on yourself, on your skin. Don\u2019t worry about breathing it, breathing it won\u2019t hurt you.\u2019\u201d When Sharman speaks, his racing thoughts escape like mismatched puzzle pieces. He is easily frustrated when others don\u2019t seem to understand how they join together. He\u2019s used to being misunderstood and disbelieved. Three years ago Sharman was sent to a mental health facility for a month, diagnosed with delusional disorder, after claiming he had been poisoned by EDB. But he is not delusional. His psychologist, Marged Goode, describes him as someone who was \u201cfunctioning fairly effectively before the chemical contamination and has been dysfunctional since\u201d. Sharman describes it as \u201cjust 20 years of confusion, torment\u201d. He has been diagnosed with a long list of chronic conditions that he says contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and left him unable to work. The occupational medicine specialist Bruce Hocking says there is \u201cgood evidence\u201d that some of Sharman\u2019s conditions were caused by overexposure to EDB. Authorities have known about the effects of the highly toxic chemical \u2013 a known carcinogen with properties similar to mustard gas, capable of mutating DNA \u2013 for more than 40 years. In Australia, moves to ban EDB as a fumigant started in 1984. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show the Queensland department of primary industries (DPI) was warned bluntly \u2013 about seven months before Sharman was last exposed \u2013 about significant health and safety concerns related to the EDB fumigation chambers. Sharman\u2019s work and medical records indicate his exposure continued for six months after licensing authorities withdrew permits for EDB. \u201cNone of that information ever filtered through to us,\u201d Sharman says. \u201cWe were just out in the field just working in the tent.\u201d \u201cImagine finding this out 22 years later and that it was all hidden, that they knew all about it. Not only that, they were there and showed us how to use it. These are professional people in their fields. With prior knowledge, how could you do that? \u201cOf course I\u2019m devastated about myself and my own family, coming home every day and poisoning my family, I really have no words for it. Heinous in nature. It was state-sanctioned poisoning.\u201d Chemical warfare On 17 October 1995 a farmer near Cairns found fruit fly maggots under the skin of a pawpaw. Within days, the papaya fruit fly, an exotic species likely to have come from the Papua New Guinea highlands and the Torres Strait, had been detected as far south as Bingil Bay, and inland at Mareeba. The response to the outbreak was necessarily aggressive, given the existential threat to agricultural industries in the wet tropics. Workers called themselves \u201cfruit fly fighters\u201d and the offensive \u2013 implemented by north Queensland DPI managers who sidelined the department\u2019s own fruit fly scientists \u2013 relied on the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Extraordinary quantities of chemicals were used. Documents obtained under FoI show 80,000L and 114,000kg of EDB were purchased in Australia in 1995. Huge amounts of malathion, methyl bromide, fenthion and dimethoate, which were all used as pesticides, were also brought into the country. The DPI was granted several \u201coff-label\u201d permits for the emergency use of certain chemicals, which would allow them to be used in unconventional ways. On 9 November 1995, the then Queensland premier, Wayne Goss, met fruit growers in Cairns to address concerns about the chemicals, mainly because some international and domestic markets \u2013 including Japan, New Zealand and the Australian Capital Territory \u2013 had refused to accept produce that had been treated with pesticides after being harvested. It later emerged more than 10,000 pallets of fruit had to be dumped, after reaching markets with damage caused by fumigation. The front page of the following day\u2019s Cairns Post quoted Goss speaking about \u201cunnecessary fears\u201d regarding the use of chemicals, and saying there was \u201cno health risk\u201d. Goss did acknowledge the chemicals could be dangerous to workers \u201cif safety precautions were not adhered to\u201d. In those first few weeks, workers began to show signs of acute exposure. Sharman\u2019s medical records show that on 10 and 22 November he saw his local GP, who logged his overexposure with the tropical health unit. The doctor\u2019s notes record: \u201cheadaches, giddy, sleepy\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d Sharman says. \u201cAll my skin was burned, I was all burned up inside my shorts, in my genital area, on the inside of my elbows and the back of my knees. I\u2019d worked out in the sun before ... but I\u2019d never been burned in those places before.\u201d \u2018Soaked in chemical\u2019 Mark Trinca was a health nut. He ran a nutrition business with his wife and cycled up to 1,000km a week. In 2011, while riding, he noticed a lump in his groin. The diagnosis was Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, his first bout of aggressive cancer. Trinca recalls: \u201cI just looked at the doctor and my question to him was, \u2018How the hell did I get this? I do everything right.\u2019\u201d The doctor responded with a question of his own. \u201cDo you work in agriculture?\u201d Trinca had spent six years \u2013 from 1997 to 2003 \u2013 working for the DPI and most of that time \u201csoaked in chemical\u201d; manufacturing canite blocks doused in the organophosphate malathion, installing the blocks and using pesticide sprays. He says he went years without being monitored for symptoms of exposure. Trinca was shown chemical procedures by veterans of the papaya fruit fly program. They told him \u201cto blanket the whole place \u2026 to put as much chemical out as we can, and that way, we\u2019re going to eradicate it fast and hard\u201d. By 2002, Trinca\u2019s work diaries show he would regularly get sick when he came back from extended periods in the Torres Strait, where he worked on Northwatch, a successor to the fruit fly eradication program. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t flu-like symptoms. I was getting nauseous. It was quite an interesting feeling where it was a deep fatigue. I can only explain it as a deep bone fatigue.\u201d Last year Trinca underwent an operation for a liposarcoma, his second rare cancer. Doctors say if it returns \u2013 and there is a high chance it will \u2013 there will be nothing more they can do. \u201cI really can\u2019t see a reason,\u201d Trinca says. \u201cI did the right thing for the right people. I worked my arse off for the government. I followed the procedures, I did everything that I was supposed to. \u201cI\u2019m probably one of those people who can show from a lifestyle point of view there was no other risk factors. I had two \u2026 extremely high-grade cancers. The research links both of them to pesticide and herbicide exposure. Doctors who I\u2019ve spoken to say there\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s what it is. But I can\u2019t get anyone to put it in writing.\u201d Cowboys and guinea pigs Elizabeth Bors was working at a local market in Mareeba in late 1995 when she applied for a job on the eradication campaign. She worked mainly with malathion, used in efforts to attract and kill the male papaya fruit fly, installing blocks soaked in the chemical and spraying it on to crops around the Atherton Tablelands community. \u201cI recall being told by a DPI representative that there was no real data on the handling and use of the chemicals and that we were guinea pigs,\u201d Bors said in a signed statement to the Queensland supreme court in 2006. The statement, made in a civil case about damaged coffee crops, detailed a common complaint about the program\u2019s operation; a lack of informed consent from people instructed to work with chemicals. Bors said many were otherwise long-term unemployed, thankful for the steady work and reluctant to ask questions. \u201cI recall being told the names of the chemicals we were using but was not given any real data on them,\u201d Bors said in her statement. Bors said DPI managers had been \u201ctight\u201d with expenditure and did not provide proper protective equipment. She said workers had been told to reuse rubber gloves and had to \u201cfight to get supplies, like soap and other necessities\u201d. One former DPI manager tells Guardian Australia he was aware of claims made by workers for compensation owing to chemical exposure. He said he would have opposed any such claims. \u201cThey were slackers, they knew it was coming to an end, the money was coming to an end and they tried everything they possibly could to keep that going,\u201d the former manager says. \u201cI bought protective equipment and everything myself, on my credit card for the government and it was available. If they didn\u2019t use it, then we know who is to blame for that.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ll be broke\u2019 In the far north, between the beach and the rainforest, between the bustling tourist towns and the snaking hinterland roads, is some of Australia\u2019s most productive farmland for cane and tropical fruit. \u201cChemicals have always been part and parcel of farming in this part of the world,\u201d says Yvonne Cunningham, a long-term Innisfail resident and environmentalist, who has been a local critic of agricultural chemical practices since the 1970s. After the papaya fruit fly outbreak, farm workers began to contact Cunningham to raise the alarm about the required pesticide treatments, and she began to advocate on their behalf. \u201cPeople were told they had to dip their fruit in this organochlorine, dimethoate, and they had no protective clothing,\u201d she says. \u201cThey had big vats of this chemical. They had to dispose of it on their own property. \u201cThe kids were playing in the kitchen and mum is there with the dimethoate, dipping the bananas or pawpaws. They said, \u2018If we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t send our fruit away, then we can\u2019t get any money and we\u2019ll be broke.\u2019 \u201cThey had no alternative. I said, \u2018At least wear gloves. Don\u2019t go dipping your hands in the stuff. Don\u2019t go dumping it in pits near the house.\u2019\u201d Cunningham recalls workers getting sick and walking off the job, residents near the fumigation chambers being poisoned by clouds of gas. In her files are letters from workers expressing their concerns. One man, Brian Warn, a father of threee from Bilyana, told the ABC in 1996 he had been poisoned by fumes from a nearby fumigation chamber. In another letter, a 23-year-old woman, V Eller, talks about \u201cgetting severe headaches, to the point of convulsions\u201d. \u201cWhen I have expressed this concern to doctors, I have been told the chemicals aren\u2019t dangerous and they use them themselves in their gardens,\u201d she wrote. With farms facing ruin and livelihoods at stake, Cunningham says her concerns about chemicals were often unwelcome. She recalls being thrown out of a fruit packing shed during a meeting of growers and farmworkers near Tully after she attempted to speak. \u201cI stood up to speak and \u2026 two heavies moved over and picked me up, one under each arm, and carried me out of the shed,\u201d she remembers. Cunningham, who was later appointed to a government health liaison committee, says the DPI wouldn\u2019t consider alternatives to chemicals: \u201cThe politicians were standing up in parliament saying these chemicals are safe. \u201cThey\u2019d already bought the chemicals. So they had this huge stockpile of chemicals and they had to use it. They ordered the chemicals right at the outset, at day one.\u201d Compensation rejected In a 2015 report the Cancer Council highlighted the difficulties in obtaining compensation for chronic occupational illnesses, in which symptoms often manifest years or decades later. The report estimated that 92 out of 100 people who contract occupational-derived cancers do not receive any sort of workers\u2019 compensation. The report concluded there were \u201cinherent difficulties in assigning a specific case to an occupational cause\u201d. In Sharman\u2019s case, WorkCover Queensland has accepted he was exposed to EDB for a nine-month period \u2013 including after it was banned. WorkCover accepts medical evidence that Sharman has suffered from multiple medical conditions, including two cancer precursor conditions, diseases affecting his lungs and teeth, skin conditions, migraines and various psychiatric illnesses. Sharman now has three separate medical opinions \u2013 from a pathologist, a psychologist and an occupational doctor \u2013 which say his symptoms may have been caused by exposure to EDB. Dr Bruce Hocking, a leading occupational medical specialist, says it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that some conditions were the result of overexposure. But WorkCover has twice rejected Sharman\u2019s compensation claim. Most recently, he was told \u201cthe available medical evidence\u201d does not prove that the conditions were the result of his employment with the DPI. In an email to Sharman last year, the pathologist Charles Appleton, the head of biochemistry at QML Pathology, wrote that \u201ccausality is difficult to establish\u201d. \u201cThe fact is that EDB can cause [these conditions] and you have been exposed to EDB and you have so many of them \u2026 it can be argued that the whole picture suggests abnormal toxic exposure.\u201d The DPI no longer exists. Its modern iteration, Queensland\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, said it had difficulty commenting about past practices given the amount of time that had passed, the fact many of the staff concerned had since retired, and that some records relating to the papaya fruit fly program had been destroyed in Cyclone Yasi in 2011. The new asbestos Many in the agricultural industry are watching developments in the US, where a groundbreaking civil ruling against the chemical company Monsanto, in relation to the commonly used weedkiller glyphosate (Roundup) has prompted a string of litigation relating to agricultural chemicals. Pesticides and herbicides have been called \u201cthe next asbestos\u201d. Kate Hughes, an environmental advocate and researcher with a focus on hazardous chemicals who spent time in north Queensland during the papaya fruit fly eradication program, says regulators in Australia \u201chad to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th century\u201d. \u201cWith the acutely toxic [chemicals] like EDB you could only shake your head and say, \u2018Don\u2019t they have any compassion for working-class people, for working people who can\u2019t rush off to a lawyer and say I\u2019ve been poisoned.\u2019 \u201cIt was 1995 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if it was 1975. It was quite shocking to know the conditions under which people were obliged to apply [chemicals]. It\u2019s very hard to apply toxic pesticides in a tropical climate. It\u2019s very, very hard to use the protective equipment. You could say that in certain climates it\u2019s virtually impossible to apply occupational health and safety, because of the conditions.\u201d Hughes says the permit system failed in allowing EDB to be used. She agrees emergency measures were needed in some circumstances but that these \u201cclearly weren\u2019t balanced with the need to protect health\u201d. \u201cEDB is incredibly acutely toxic. It\u2019s a shockingly strong nerve poison or neurotoxin, it can damage the brain in various ways [and] affect our emotions, learning and behaviour.\u201d Hughes was one of the first researchers to write about the mental health impacts of chemicals, now well established by research, and also the effects of prolonged exposure to amounts considered harmless by regulators. Her 1994 book, Quick Poison, Slow Poison, was ahead of its time in recognising the way chemicals act as \u201cslow poisons ... that cause sickness in people who are regularly exposed to small doses over long periods of time\u201d. But she maintains chemicals \u2013 including Roundup \u2013 are useful and necessary to support farmers to produce food and protect biodiversity from invasive species. \u201cThe whole modern food production system, whether you like it or don\u2019t like it, requires the use of pesticides,\u201d she says. But she adds that the fact those same chemicals are sold in supermarkets \u201can aisle over from the bread\u201d is \u201can obscenity\u201d. \u201cDoctors now know about lead but it took a long time,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cDoctors know now about asbestos but it took a long time. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not alarmist on this but I certainly am alarmed. What I\u2019ve been reading over the past five years [about chemicals] is that humans are the test animals, we\u2019re just not getting the test right.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
