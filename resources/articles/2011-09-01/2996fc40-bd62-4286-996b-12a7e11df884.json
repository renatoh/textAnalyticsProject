Everton's successful start to the season might make you wonder what all the fuss was about. After demonstrations at Goodison Park at the direction the club have been heading in under the chairman, Bill Kenwright, the Toffees have picked up more points per game than anyone outside the Premier League top four. However, off the pitch matters are indeed far less rosy: Digger can reveal that Everton have forward-sold their central Premier League broadcast income not only for this season but for the 2012-13 campaign as well. As Kenwright has privately admitted, Everton's prior lenders, Barclays Bank and Investec, are not prepared to extend their credit lines to his club. But that has not prevented Everton from accessing credit. Last month a mortgage deed was signed with Vibrac Corporation, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. As such it is impossible to determine who the lender is and whether it has any links in football \u2013 although it must be stressed that in common with all such assignments of central funds, it has been approved by the Premier League. The loan is a one-year facility for \u00a314m, replacing a mortgage agreed with Investec 12 months previously, in which this season's central funds were signed over to the bank. That Investec loan was a departure from the terms of the 2009 agreement with Barclays, in which only the same season's Premier League funds were borrowed against to assist with cashflow. To sell future seasons' income is intrinsically more risky, both for the lender and the mortgager. There can be no guarantees that Everton will even be in the Premier League next season, and although there has been no disclosure of the interest-rate terms, that risk is normally priced into what yield the creditor must pay, making the rate more expensive. Everton are insouciant about the deal, insisting that even if the worst happens they could cover it from the bumper parachute payments from the Premier League. But that income is meant as a relegation cushion, not to cover cashflow difficulties. Localism may help fans It comes too late for Plymouth Argyle, but draft legislation in parliament could have a major effect on the business of football. When it becomes law next year, the Localism Bill will permit councils to list \"assets of community value\", giving local groups the right to buy those properties. That will allow supporters' groups to make bids for football-club stadiums. Under Argyle's much-criticised administration process, there have been complaints that fans have been frozen out of the process to bid for the club. But if fans have made a successful application to list a football club's real estate \u2013 its ground and training centre \u2013 landlords (or major secured creditors) will be required to give six weeks' consideration to a supporter-led bid for that asset. This may raise complex issues about how the \"moratorium period\" will affect funding the costs of an administration but the fundamental principle of allowing fans to take over their club's property, thus guaranteeing rental terms are not too onerous, is surely welcome. Walker fraud victim again Air Marshall Sir John Walker, the one-time time Chief of Defence Intelligence, is back in the news, again as the unwitting victim of a fraud. Countermine Technologies has alleged to police that the email account belonging to Air Marshall Walker during his time as a director there (he resigned after nearly five years in April 2010) had been hacked. A man has been arrested. Walker is, of course, known to readers of this column as a member of the advisory board of First London plc, the investment bank whose guarantees led to an offshore consortium led by Russell King taking over Notts County in 2009 in an ill-fated scam first uncovered here. Walker, who was appointed to the Meadow Lane board after the takeover, was not party to the guarantees but admitted that, in being taken in by King and his associates, he had been \"duped\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
