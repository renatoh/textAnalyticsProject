Now most face losses; some a wipeout. The firms involved, safe-looking insurance companies, say buyers were told they could lose. But the same insurers worked overtime to ensure buyers saw warnings, where they noticed them, as a mix of regulatory necessity and statistical improbability. All those \"back testings\" to comfort us that the sort of events which would trigger big losses were highly unlikely to happen related to the good old days of the bull markets. We all have to think \"bear\" now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
