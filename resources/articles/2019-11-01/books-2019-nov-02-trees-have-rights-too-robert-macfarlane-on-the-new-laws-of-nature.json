For years, Lake Erie \u2013 the southernmost of the Great Lakes \u2013 has been in ecological crisis. Invasive species are rampant. Biodiversity is crashing. Each summer, blue-green algae blooms in volumes visible from space, creating toxic \u201cdead zones\u201d; the algae is nourished by fertiliser and slurry pollution from surrounding farms. In August 2014, phosphorus run-off so fouled Erie that the city of Toledo, at the lake\u2019s western tip in Ohio, lost drinking water for three days in the hottest part of the year. Appalled by the lake\u2019s degradation, and exhausted by state and federal failures to improve Erie\u2019s health, in December 2018 Toledo residents drew up an extraordinary document: an emergency \u201cbill of rights\u201d for Lake Erie. At the bill\u2019s heart was a radical proposition: that the \u201cLake Erie ecosystem\u201d should be granted legal personhood, and accorded the consequent rights in law \u2013 including the right \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d. The Erie Bill of Rights is a brief, passionate, urgent text; reminiscent to me of a scene from a Greek tragedy or an Ibsen play. \u201cWe, the people of the City of Toledo \u2026 \u201d runs the italicised choral refrain; a \u201crecital\u201d, in legalese. The bill\u2019s phrasing rings with love and rage. It dreams beautifully of an equitable land ethic. \u201cIt has become necessary,\u201d the bill declares, \u201cthat we \u2026 extend legal rights to our natural environment to ensure that the natural world [is] no longer subordinated to the accumulation of surplus wealth and unaccountable political power.\u201d In 1970, JG Ballard coined the phrase \u201cinvisible literature\u201d to mean \u201cthe vast majority of published documents \u2013 from market research reports, pharmaceutical company house magazines [to] US government reports and medical textbooks\u201d. I take the Erie Bill of Rights to be exemplary of the \u201cinvisible literature\u201d of our Anthropocene moment. At once hopeful and desperate, it is a late-hour attempt to prevent a slow-motion ecocide. Embedded in the bill is a bold ontological claim \u2013 that Lake Erie is a living being, not a bundle of ecosystem services. The bill is, really, a work of what might be called \u201cnew animism\u201d (the word comes from the Latin anima, meaning spirit, breath, life). By reassigning both liveliness and vulnerability to the lake, it displaces Erie from its instrumentalised roles as sump and source. As such, the bill forms part of a broader set of comparable recent legal moves in jurisdictions around the world \u2013 all seeking to recognise interdependence and animacy in the living world, and often advanced by indigenous groups \u2013 which have together come to be known as the \u201cnatural rights\u201d or \u201crights of nature\u201d movement. The Lake Erie Ecosystem Bill of Rights came before Toledo citizens in a referendum on 26 February; 61% voted for it, and Lake Erie became \u2013 symbolically, temporarily \u2013 a \u201clegal person\u201d. It joined other more-than-human entities accorded various versions of legal personhood, including the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India (though this decision was later overturned by India\u2019s supreme court), the Whanganui River in New Zealand (designated by parliamentary declaration \u201can indivisible and living whole\u201d), the Colombian Amazon, and all nature in Ecuador, which in 2008 famously enshrined the rights of \u201cPachamama\u201d (\u201cMother Nature\u201d) in its constitution (though the subsequent benefit of this enshrining for both indigenous Ecuadorians and nature is highly debatable). At first sight, the rights of nature movement appears potentially forceful as well as intellectually fascinating. To many lawyers and philosophers, however, the assigning of legal personhood to a more than human entity is a profound category error, which can create more problems than it solves. Critics observe that corporations also have standing as legal persons; is it desirable that the Niger Delta might exist in legal affinity with Shell? The plaintiff power of personhood also becomes a liability risk. If a river may bring an action against a factory for polluting it, may a developer in turn sue that river when flood water damages the housing stock? Legal recourses \u2013 in tort, criminal and public law \u2013 already exist to protect nature, and may be thought more robust than rights-based moves, which are often subject to swift challenge or reversal. There is also the problem of defining \u201cbeing\u201d. Where does a forest begin and end? Is a mountain made of the rain it draws down from the clouds as well as the bedrock that gives it altitude? More political criticisms find the idea of a lake as rights bearer objectionable, given the scant rights extended to many subjugated human groups, or note that when cramming indigenous worldviews into western rights-law frameworks, a colonial distortion is inevitable, however well intentioned the undertaking. Anthropomorphism is also awkwardly central to the natural rights movement. Lakes and forests must undergo transformation into \u201clegal persons\u201d, rather than being recognised as \u201clegal lakes\u201d or \u201clegal forests\u201d. Because a river is unable to stand up in court, a human proxy must inevitably bring an action, determine optimal outcome, and do the river\u2019s talking for it. \u201cWe risk only having respect for things insofar as they resemble human experience and characteristics,\u201d writes Anna Grear, among the best analysts of this movement. \u201cThe law [instead] needs to develop a new framework in which the human is entangled and thrown in the midst of a lively materiality \u2013 rather than assumed to be the masterful, knowing centre.\u201d Or as Thomas Berry puts it in The Great Work, \u201cTrees have tree rights, insects have insect rights, rivers have river rights, and mountains have mountain rights\u201d. These are all good criticisms. Nevertheless, there is value to be salvaged from \u2013 and encouraged in \u2013 the natural rights movement. Its messy idealism is a function of desperation; a grapple with David Abrams\u2019s stricken question: \u201cHow can a culture as educated as ours be so oblivious, so reckless, in its relations to the animate earth?\u201d I am sympathetic with the movement\u2019s wish to recognise the more-than-human world as animistically, entanglingly alive, rather than as an inert \u201cstanding reserve\u201d. Like Grear, I find that at its best this young legal movement presses vital questions concerning \u201cjustice to the nonhuman\u201d and requires us to \u201cre-imagine our own state of being in a richer and more open way\u201d. It is one aspect of what she memorably calls the \u201cradical re-storying\u201d of human-nonhuman relations that is now needed to shape \u201ca future worth living\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Such \u201cradical re-storying\u201d is presently under way across culture, theory, politics and literature, as well as law. It is visible, for example, in the creative protests of Extinction Rebellion; in the \u201cnew animist\u201d scholarship of Isabelle Stengers, Abram and Eduardo Kohn; in Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s long-term project \u2013 drawing on her dual identity as plant scientist and member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation \u2013 of recovering a \u201cgrammar of animacy\u201d by means of which kinship across species divides can be honoured in language; in forest ecology\u2019s recent revelations concerning the underground mycorrhizal networks that connect individual trees into intercommunicating forests; and in campaigner and barrister Polly Higgins\u2019s work, before her cruelly early death, to realise ecocide as a crime within international law. All these efforts, as Amitav Ghosh puts it, \u201cseek to recognise something we had turned away from: that is to say, the presence and proximity of nonhuman interlocutors\u201d. A turning back towards \u201cnonhuman interlocutors\u201d has also occurred in recent fiction where \u201cland\u201d is encountered as sensate, memorious and even intentful, rather than a static stage set for human actions. From Australia there is the towering body of work \u2013 both novels and essays \u2013 by the lands-rights activist and indigenous writer Alexis Wright, which explore \u201cspecial acts\u201d of rights-giving to nature in both modern law and \u201cancestral stories\u201d. In Britain, I think of Daisy Johnson\u2019s dazzling Fen and Everything Under, Max Porter\u2019s Lanny, Fiona Mozley\u2019s Elmet, Zoe Gilbert\u2019s Folk, Richard Skelton\u2019s Beyond the Fell Wall, and Laura Beatty\u2019s quietly brilliant Pollard and Darkling, in which trees grow through human lives in shaping ways. Place, in these works, is not a regressive repository for nativist truths or buried treasures; it is volatile and commotion causing. Land \u2013 to borrow Nan Shepherd\u2019s wonderful verb \u2013 \u201cbristles\u201d; it morphs and causes metamorphosis. \u201cThe soil was alive with ruptured stories that cascaded and rotted,\u201d Mozley writes in Elmet, \u201cthen found form once more and pushed up through the undergrowth and back into our lives.\u201d Johnson\u2019s Fen is a book of jinking prose, in which no sentence or story ends as one might expect from its beginning, and place is the source of shift and transition. Porter\u2019s landscapes remember, utter, worm into and through human bodies. These writers dispute what Stengers, in her essay \u201cRethinking Animism\u201d, calls \u201cthe acceptance [of the] hard truth that we are alone in a mute, blind, yet knowable world \u2013 one that is our task to appropriate\u201d. A new-old animism is also advanced in Richard Powers\u2019s magnificent novel The Overstory. The US environmentalist and author Bill McKibben said that he could not put The Overstory down because it was \u201ca novel that took protest seriously\u201d; it is also a novel that takes trees seriously. It is, really, a vast forest of a novel, with animism its sap. Powers has said that he was \u201ctrying to resurrect a very old form of tree-consciousness, a religion of attention and accommodation \u2026 that credits other forms of life \u2013 indeed, the life-process as a whole \u2013 with wanting something\u201d. Some of the book\u2019s finest scenes occur \u201ctwo hundred feet above the surface of the planet\u201d, in the crown of a California giant redwood nicknamed \u201cMimas\u201d. Living up in the canopy for weeks, the protesters trying to prevent Mimas\u2019s logging come to know the tree as a living community, a sky city. Animism is the driving force of their activism; a belief in the rights of more-than-human beings \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d. Reading Powers\u2019s masterpiece, I was reminded of the Sheffield tree protests, ongoing since 2013, when communities mobilised to prevent their city\u2019s deforestation when it emerged that up to 17,000 street trees might be felled under the blind logic of a Private Finance Initiative contract. The city\u2019s trees were defended legally but also imaginatively. They gained names \u2013 \u201cVernon Oak\u201d, \u201cDuchess Lime\u201d \u2013 and were studied, storied and sung to, becoming newly apprised as neighbours and co-citizens with human inhabitants of the city. The Sheffield tree protesters and Powers are reacting in different ways to what Ghosh in The Great Derangement identifies as the doubled unsettlement of the Anthropocene; an epoch in which Earth is revealing itself as both acutely vulnerable and restlessly lively. \u201cThe uncanny and improbable events that are beating at our doors,\u201d Ghosh writes, \u201cseem to have stirred a sense of recognition \u2026 that humans were never alone, that we have always been surrounded by beings who share elements of that which we thought most distinctively our own: the capacities of will, thought and consciousness.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The most restlessly lively place I know is Orford Ness, a 10-mile-long shingle spit that curves south along the Suffolk coast like a bracket. The Ness is an offshore desert, an untrue island. Shaped by storm, tide and longshore drift, it is startlingly dynamic. Between 1812 and 1821 alone its length shifted by nearly two miles. If you could view the Ness as an aerial stop-motion film shot over several centuries, you would see its long stone tail whipping around in the North Sea. Because of its isolation, for 70 years (1913\u201383) the Ness was used by the Ministry of Defence for secret weapons testing; from air-gunnery and bombing during the first world war, to the environmental testing of British nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s. It is, therefore, a landscape produced by a collision of the human death drive and natural life. Now it is a conservation site like no other, unnerving in its juxtapositions, where decaying ferroconcrete test laboratories are recolonised by moss, bracken and elder to become \u201cgreen chapels\u201d, black-backed gulls build their nests in broken control panels, brown hares big as deer lope across shingle expanses cratered by explosions, and the wind sings in the wires of abandoned perimeter fences. I have returned to Orford Ness dozens of times since my first visit some 15 years ago. There is no English landscape that has haunted me more deeply, or drawn me back more often. And for three years I wrote about it, making \u2013 with the artist Stanley Donwood \u2013 a 96\u2011page book called Ness. I don\u2019t know quite how to describe it: a novella-length prose-poem written to be spoken aloud, perhaps \u2013 or a futile attempt to retell Sir Gawain and the Green Knight for the Anthropocene. Ness takes place on an unnamed shingle island, inside a dilapidating concrete structure known as The Green Chapel, where a brutal male figure called The Armourer is leading a nuclear ritual with catastrophic intent. Converging on The Green Chapel are five more-than-human beings, traversing land, sea and time to prevent the ritual\u2019s fulfilment: \u201cShe nears Ness. Her skin is lichen &amp; her flesh is moss &amp; her bones are fungi &amp; she breathes spores. She is wired into the world. There are miles of her in each pinch of soil \u2026 \u201d The figure of The Armourer inevitably echoes certain male autocrats currently occupying seats of power, and Ness is surfacing into a contemporary moment of protest against the living world\u2019s systemic annihilation. But its form was influenced by ancient precedents, including medieval mystery play cycles and the early Irish bardic poem \u201cBuile Suibhne\u201d (translated as \u201cSweeney Astray\u201d by Seamus Heaney). It also has origins in my surprise, rereading Beowulf and the Epic of Gilgamesh, at how central natural destruction is to both these founding texts of literature. Gilgamesh travels to the Cedar Forest where he sets about felling the great trees. Beowulf leaves the mead hall to wage war on the \u201cwilde\u00f3r\u201d (wild creatures) of marsh and moor. In Ness, this order is reversed. It wonders instead what happens when land itself comes alive and seeks to thwart human rapacity. Ness is eerie in the sense Skelton uses that word; \u201cengaging with \u2018the eerie\u2019 is fundamentally an acknowledgement of life beyond our own species \u2026 about probing that complex, troubling relationship between humans and others.\u201d A recurring object in Ness is the \u201chagstone\u201d; a pebble with a hole worn naturally through it. Many hagstones are cast up on the foreshore of Orford Ness. In folklore across Europe, to look through such a stone is to see into the future, the past or the afterlife. In Ness, the hagstone is an optic through which one can see nature come alive in its own right, with its own powers. The biologist EO Wilson has warned that, as the extinction rate climbs, humans are entering \u201cThe Eremocene\u201d \u2013 the Age of Loneliness. The most recent State of Nature report, published last month, found one in seven UK species to be at risk of disappearance. Research released in September showed North America to have lost 3 billion birds \u2013 29% of total population \u2013 in 50 years. The dryads and naiads of classical myth, those lively spirits of trees and streams, have long since been driven out. Now birds, mammals, plants and insects are vanishing too, leaving humans increasingly alone in the world. The new animism, if we can call it that, of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights, of The Overstory, of Ness, of Fen, of Sheffield, may be heard as a cry into \u2013 and against \u2013 such desolating solitude. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that Toledo city councillors drew up the Lake Erie Bill of Rights. That document was drawn up by residents of Toledo. \u2022 Ness by Robert Macfarlane and Stanley Donwood is published by Hamish Hamilton. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
