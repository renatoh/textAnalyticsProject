Seven long weeks have passed since election day, seven pretty miserable weeks for Labour's supporters. Directionless, wrong-headed, the government has offered little cheer to the millions who voted for them. Labour was so strangely unprepared for victory. All last year was devoted to election planning and writing an uninspiring manifesto - with no plan for what came next. In 1997 they hit the ground rolling out a carpet of well-made plans from one end of Whitehall to the other. But this time they hit the ground and fell on their face. None of us is happy. Nor are they. Tony Blair briefly caught the sombre post-election mood after that catastrophic turn-out, but since then there has been confusion, crass obstinacy and little to love them for. Wrong notes have clashed out in needless aggravations: not spin this time, but the absolute victor's lofty indifference. Why was Rupert Murdoch the first footer in Downing Street? Why did a dull Queen's speech omit the bill to ban tobacco advertising and the election promise of civilised European 24-hour licensing laws? Over-sympathy with President Bush's defence plans could have waited with more dignity on a general European response. Why was the chancellor's first act to cut corporation tax to sub-US levels, on top of no income tax rises? Blair's only response to Genoa demonstrators suggests zero empathy with what little political passion remains among the non-voting young. Only gross ineptitude turned Gwyneth Dunwoody into the darling of the House by fixing the select committees. Strangest of all has been the strident but careless talk suggesting unlimited privatisation with no concrete plan, alarming the unions and pleasing no one. Now government in Scotland and Wales looks better judged: Morgan and Mcleish say sternly that the public sector gets first chance to prove itself - but if they fail, all bets are off. That well-received message contrasts poorly with Tony Blair's vague threats that left many imagining schools and hospitals soon to be franchised to Coca-Cola. How fortunate he is in John Monks, who today puts to the TUC general council a far more measured and statesmanlike response than the prime minister's ill-considered language. The TUC statement for autumn congress calls for intensive dialogue with all ministers to determine what the true plans are in every sector, followed by more discussion with the PM. A holiday is what Labour needs. As they sit in their olive groves or patriotically shivering under the breakwater of some windy British beach, they have much to contemplate - and much to fear. All attention is now on \"delivery\", a balloon of inflated expectations. Gold-plated schools and surgeries will not materialise in just four years. It will be lucky if there are easily measurable improvements and very lucky if these are visible to the naked eye of voters. Delivery is tough and on its own lacks an idea or a set of values to draw people into the progressive journey itself. Without vision, the citizen is reduced to a grumbling consumer, not a participant. Gradgrind league tables may nudge up a bit in four years' time, but alone they are not enough to engage a dangerously alienated electorate. Hope needs more than shorter waiting lists. Delivery is hard. In the NHS there is something akin to panic among people in the know. The apparently huge cash increases of the first two years' real growth are all spoken for in past debts accumulated surviving the pre-election winter at any price and in wage rises: no money yet for improvement. The national plan contains 360 targets, now ranked \"must do\", \"must, must do\" and some \"must, must, must dos\". Managers feel oppressed, staff shortages are acute, PFIs are complex and the larger ones unwelcome. Suffering under 10 years of perpetual revolution, trying to devolve 75% of all NHS spending onto precarious GP primary care groups, managers sigh at new \"strategic health authorities\" not at all unlike regional health authorities abolished not long ago. So when the NHS hears Blair demand \"reform\", they wonder when there was last stasis: of course they groan. In the autumn various uncomfortable NHS reports will bring no good news. Everyone will ask how massive 6% annual increases still bring no immediate results - and meeting EU average spending looks well out of reach. Meanwhile, Whitehall's odd failure to spend its departmental allocations conceals stories of deep frustration. I am watching delivery at ground level inside one new deal for communities. When residents saw photos of their MP waving a cheque for \u00a356m for their crime-ridden Clapham Park estate they thought the money was there to start now on new security doors and window locks. Far from it. The cheque sits in the regional office. Every quarter Clapham Park must spend exactly what the plan decrees. To underspend is to fail, and to fail repeatedly risks closure. But to get money they must first apply to their accountable body (Lambeth council) who has to pay up front. Lambeth can't get repaid by the regional office until the project is done and evaluated. If anything goes wrong, Lambeth risks never getting reimbursed. Then the region takes two to four months to agree and pay. The forms for each minor allocation are a nightmare, even for a summer play scheme - and all this is done by a board comprised of 50% estate residents learning as they go. Is it any wonder spending is difficult when the Treasury devises such devilish obstacles through two dilatory bureaucracies? If Blair wants delivery, it is Treasury rules that need fundamental reform. What hope of better to come? Plenty - and the Labour party policy forum meeting this weekend could help by giving a firm prod in the progressive direction. The new Cabinet, despite some dead wood, has strong newcomers in Estelle Morris, Patricia Hewitt, Tessa Jowell and Charles Clarke. Blunkett shows signs of striking off on a better Home Office agenda. Kyoto news is good with Britain upping its target. The Commons wakes like the Kraken and Robin Cook has the makings of a great democratic reformer. In most departments ministers wrestle with the reigns of power to make things work better: yesterday's announcement of more childcare will be life-transforming for 45,000 extra families, with more to come. Foolishly, Labour's fits of insane obstinacy (such as the London tube PPP) overshadow the good done elsewhere. Odd how in many spheres the government's actual progress is better than the account it gives of itself, its deeds better than its words. But if the clouds now gathering over the economy break, the government will need all the trust it can muster. So on holiday let ministers and MPs consider how to stop squandering goodwill so recklessly. p.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
