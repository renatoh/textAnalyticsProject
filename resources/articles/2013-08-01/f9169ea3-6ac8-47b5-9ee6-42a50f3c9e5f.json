George Bush Sr banned it from Air Force One, but now it's presumably back on the menu, because it's Barack Obama's favourite. It may be because it is so good for you. It had already been recognised as the most nutritious of all known vegetables, rich in vitamins C and A, folic acid and calcium. Oh, and fibre. Now we learn it can fend off osteoarthritis, because it's also got sulforaphane, a compound with anti-carcinogenic properties. Given all this healthiness, no wonder many children so dislike it. Certainly, the former president's hostility rang with the loathing that is a legacy of miserable first experiences. \"I haven't liked it since I was a little child,\" he said, \"and I'm president of the United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli.\" Maybe it's the way it was cooked, for it suffers, like any vegetable, from being too long in the pot.
