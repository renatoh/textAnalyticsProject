The Manchester United manager said his club would survive the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo and that the team to fear in Europe was still Barcelona. He joked Real's squad was so unbalanced he half-expected Ronaldo to be used as a centre-half. Speaking at the launch of the Audi Cup, a four-team tournament comprising United, Boca Juniors, Bayern Munich and Milan, Ferguson derided Madrid's attempts to muscle their way back into the Champions League, a competition they have not won for seven years. Ferguson cited the fall of Sunderland in 1958 as an example of where money can take you in football. \"Sunderland spent so much money that they became known as 'The Bank of England club',\" he said. \"They didn't win anything and in the end they got themselves relegated. \"I am not saying that Real Madrid will get relegated but they will still have plenty of problems with balance. I do not know how [Madrid coach] Manuel Pellegrini plans to pick his side because it has no balance. I told Ronaldo before he flew out that he will end up playing centre-half because I don't think they have one. \"Barcelona are different because they have grown their squad properly and added one or two players each season. They have a fantastic midfield and they will be once again a threat to everyone taking part in the Champions League.\" Three of the four participants in the Audi Cup have been affected by Florentino P\u00e9rez's attempt to recreate the gal\u00e1ctico project, whose expensive failure ended his first term as Real's president. Milan have lost Kaka, Manchester United have seen Ronaldo go while Bayern's president, Franz Beckenbauer, has split the club by stating that Franck Rib\u00e9ry does not care about Bayern Munich and should be allowed to leave. Ferguson thought that, though they might be damaged by Real, they would survive. \"I think it will be difficult for Milan and Manchester United to replace players of the standard of Ronaldo and Kaka,\" he said. \"But it is in the nature of our club that we cope. The expectation is still there and the drive and ambition will still be there. It will be difficult but we will cope. Ronaldo was fantastic for Manchester United. He is the best player in the world, in my opinion, but it is difficult to hold on to players from abroad for any length of time and we never expected him to stay for more than six years.\" Ferguson was joined by Louis van Gaal and Leonardo, the new coaches of Bayern Munich and Milan. Both said it would be difficult for Pellegrini, who excelled in moulding a modestly-assembled collection of players into solid Champions League performers at Villarreal, to deal with the stresses of the Bernab\u00e9u. The centre of all this vitriol, Real Madrid, were, somewhat ironically, taking part in a tournament called 'The Peace Cup'. \"They had their experiment with the gal\u00e1cticos and yet at the end of it all they did not win anything,\" said Leonardo. \"You can buy up good talent and create possibilities for yourself but it is not easy to construct a squad and manage players like Kaka, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. You need more than just money to build a team. You need more than talent, you need spirit and we will have to see if Madrid have this spirit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
