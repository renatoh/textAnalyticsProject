Late on Sunday night, all drenched in black, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s manager could see it coming and so could everyone else, a ball collected 50 yards out that felt like an open goal. Chests tightened: there was a long way to go, a lot of defenders in front of him \u2013 five six, seven of them \u2013 a passage so tight and a target so small it was hard enough to see, let alone hit, but it already felt like Lionel Messi had escaped. They had, after all, seen this so many times before: the same moment, the same movement, the same outcome, simultaneously happening in slow motion and stuck on fast-forward, which defines him somehow. It was all so very Messi. He had been waiting, watching, Simeone said. Now, with four minutes left Messi went, like Luke Skywalker beginning his approach into the trench. \u201cHe\u2019s infallible when he runs; he has the radar open,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said. Inside he went, away from Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez. Away from Thomas Partey. He played the ball to Luis Su\u00e1rez and kept going, brushing past Thomas again. Almost there, almost there. Su\u00e1rez gave it straight back. And then, enclosed but able to see the light, just in range, Messi guided the kind of shot that destroys the Death Star. Press pause the way he seems able to press pause and you see four men alongside him, an alley where the only route out is his route, a tiny opening between Jan Oblak\u2019s hand and the post. Which, with astonishing inevitability, is exactly where it went. A golazo, a golazo,\u201d Simeone said afterwards. \u201cAll you can do is applaud.\u201d He actually did too, as Messi dashed off celebrating, thudding his chest, teammates pilling on. He\u2019d been powerless there, they all had, and now they were beaten. It hadn\u2019t been Messi\u2019s best game, some said: just the 66 passes, nine dribbles, three chances created, and one 60-yard run. But with the 99th touch of his 701st game, the night before he was expected to collect his sixth Balon d\u2019Or \u2013 more than anyone else ever and still less than he might have done \u2013 he had won another match. 85 minutes, one-nil again. There was much else to pick up from this game: Greizmann\u2019s poor return to the Metropolitano, toy rats on his plaque outside, his every touch whistled and his one shot sailing over; Ivan Rakitic\u2019s return to the team; Su\u00e1rez\u2019s overlooked, decisive role in every clear chance to H\u00e9ctor Herrera\u2019s performance inmidfield; Kieran Trippier\u2019s superb crossing; Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s new reality, Simeone calling this \u201ca transitional year\u201d. Above all, it had been Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, hands so fast, wrists so strong. But then it became about Messi again. And if that suggests Messi gets talked about too much, the opposite might actually be true. Eighteen months ago, Simeone had said if you get Messi to swap sides, you get a different result. That day, a Messi free kick \u2013 that other signature goal of his \u2013 had given Barcelona a 1-0 win at the Camp Nou. Now it had happened again only in Madrid, rounding off a week that might have sunk Barcelona but which saw them still on top, set for the season. Victorious against Dortmund on Wednesday, four days later they had beaten Atl\u00e9tico too. \u201cThese are games that win you the league,\u201d Sergi Roberto said. \u201cMessi and the same story as ever,\u201d AS\u2019s headline called it. \u201cThat showed what it is to have the world\u2019s best player,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico director Clemente Villaverde said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one that makes the difference. The reason why he\u2019s the best is that he does it with terrible ease,\u201d Sa\u00fal insisted. So much ease that people make the mistake of thinking it\u2019s easy, a failure every time he doesn\u2019t do it. Which really isn\u2019t that often, considering. As Jorge Valdano once put it: \u201cMessi is Maradona every day.\u201d Even Maradona wasn\u2019t Maradona every day. This goal, another winner, was Messi\u2019s first at the Wanda Metropolitano. Against Atl\u00e9tico, at least: he had scored here in the Copa del Rey final against Sevilla, his 28th in a final. But it was also his 30th goal against them. Simeone has never defeated Barcelona in the league, in 16 attempts. Messi has scored more against Atl\u00e9tico than anyone except Sevilla. Valencia and Real Madrid follow close behind, always beating up on the little guys. Yes, they have played the bigger teams more often, but that still means he is running at 0.64 goals per game against Madrid, 0.77 against Atl\u00e9tico, 0.97 against Sevilla and 0.85 against Valencia. To put that into context, in a 38-game season solely against Atl\u00e9tico, he would get 29.2 goals, competing for the Pichichi every year, winning it in most of them. As if goals are the only thing. \u201cI\u2019d like to have an explanation for Leo,\u201d Valverde said of the player who perhaps too often is the explanation for his team. In El Pa\u00eds, Ram\u00f3n Besa noted how Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n\u2019s famous 1969 article \u201cBar\u00e7a! Bar\u00e7a! Bar\u00e7a!\u201d, the beginning of a process in which the concept of m\u00e8s que un club was created, articulating an identity for Barcelona, has given way to \u201cMessi! Messi! Messi!\u201d There is a debate to be had about the risks inherent in Messi-dependence, the structural flaws and his own culpability in that, but no real debate about the reality of it. In his 701 Barcelona games, in which he has scored 613 goals, Messi has also got somewhere 235 and 250 assists, depending on which stats you believe. Another questionable stat appeared over the weekend. Messi had played 66 passes against Atl\u00e9tico, the figures said, but it was 67; it\u2019s just that one of them was into the net. He so rarely seems to shoot in the traditional sense. Often, he doesn\u2019t even seem to really kick the ball: he sort of runs into it and then it runs off in exactly the direction he wants it to. Watch it again \u2013 watch his passes too \u2013 and he does not draw his foot back, let alone swing a leg. Yet the ball travels as if he had walloped it. It\u2019s like he sees the move in slow motion but won\u2019t let anyone else do the same, executing it too fast for that, no pause, no hesitation, no breaking stride. \u201cA goal seen a thousand times and a thousand times astonishing due to his astounding ability to adjust his shots to the run,\u201d wrote Pepe S\u00e1mano in El Pa\u00eds. The ball that Su\u00e1rez laid back to him, S\u00e1mano said, was a \u201cgolden ball.\u201d And that, of course, was the theme everyone else went for. \u201cA golden ball,\u201d said the cover of Marca, the photo capturing the moment Messi finished it. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s the Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d said the front of El Mundo, assuming he is. Sport and El Mundo Deportivo turned up in the same dress for the second day running. \u201cA test forged in fire,\u201d they said on Sunday morning; \u201cGolden Goal\u201d, they said on Monday morning, test passed. Messi had led them through the flames again. Messi is expected to collect the Ballon d\u2019Or on Monday. It would be his sixth and logic suggests it will be his last. Now 32, France Football reported that he told Neymar that he will be gone in two years. And then what? There will be complaints of course, cases made for other players \u2013 brilliant, all of them \u2013 and calls of injustice at awarding the prize to the man who provided more assists and more goals than anyone else last season, Europe\u2019s top scorer and the Champions League\u2019s top scorer too, the man whose candidacy is discredited with the same criteria used to accredit others. But when he picked up the ball a long way from goal Simeone already smelled danger, a predictability about the extraordinary moment that was unfolding which served as another, timely reminder that no one has played better than Leo Messi in 2019. Maybe no one has played better than Leo Messi, full stop. Talking points \u201cThese are the games that win leagues,\u201d Marcelo said after Real Madrid beat Alav\u00e9s 2-1 at Mendizorroza on Saturday afternoon \u2013 the same place they lost 1-0 last season. Sergio Ramos had opened the scoring before Oliver Burke, on as a sub, immediately helped Alav\u00e9s back into it, Lucas P\u00e9rez putting away the penalty. But then Dani Caravjal got the winner. That\u2019s eight unbeaten for Madrid now. \u201cMake no mistake: we have to improve,\u201d Julen Lopetegui said, but Sevilla won again and they\u2019re third. It\u2019s a Basque one and two (well, four and five) just behind them, Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao both winning again. \u201cWe need footballers who really feel their profession; we can\u2019t go on with novices and the naive,\u201d The Espanyol manager Pablo Mach\u00edn said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sodding tough to play, but it\u2019s as bad to be on the bench having to take responsibility for things that it\u2019s not you doing. If we think someone is going to come along and pull us out the shit \u2026\u201d Beaten 4-2 by Osasuna, whistled by their fans having picked up a single point at home all season, and five points from safety, Espanyol are in big, big trouble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
