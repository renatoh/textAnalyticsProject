After an all-day meeting of Vauxhall owner GM's 13-member board, chairman Ed Whitacre made a two-minute appearance at a hastily arranged press conference in Detroit to read a statement declaring that Henderson was leaving by mutual consent. Whitacre, 68, said he was personally taking on the role of chief executive pending a search for a replacement. The latest upheaval at GM comes less than five months after the carmaker's emergence from bankruptcy and eight months after the Obama administration fired Henderson's predecessor, Rick Wagoner. It came as a complete surprise to analysts and investors, who were anticipating a decision on the future of GM's troubled Swedish car brand, Saab. \"Fritz has done a remarkable job leading the company through an unprecedented period of challenge and change,\" said Whitacre. \"While momentum has been building over the past several months, all involved agree that changes need to be made.\" Whitacre bluntly refused to take questions from journalists, adding only that he wanted to assure employees, dealers, unions and customers that business would \"continue as normal\" for the manufacturer, which owns marques including Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, Vauxhall and Opel. A GM spokesman said that the US government, which owns a majority stake in GM, had been informed of Henderson's departure but had played no role in it. A search for a successor will be complicated by pay restrictions laid down by the Obama administration's so-called \"compensation czar\", Kenneth Feinberg. Industry experts expressed amazement at the sudden exit by Henderson, a GM careerist who joined the firm's treasury department in 1984 after graduating from Harvard Business School. \"This thing has got everybody back on their heels,\" said George Magliano, automotive analyst at IHS Global Insight, who said he was concerned about an exodus of expertise from the company. \"People have been leaving GM on a regular basis over the last 12 to 18 months.\" The decision to install Whitacre as interim boss could cause a stir among GM's workers. A six foot Texan with a background in telecoms, Whitacre was a complete outsider to Detroit's motor industry when he was recruited by the US government to chair GM's board in June. At the time, he admitted: \"I don't know anything about cars.\" In common with rival Chrysler, GM has struggled to cope with America's sharpest drop in car sales since the second world war, together with competition from nimbler Asian manufacturers and a shift in tastes towards smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles. With the help of some $50bn in government aid, the company executed a swift court-approved restructuring during just 40 days under bankruptcy and enjoyed a boost in sales over the summer, aided by the Obama administration's \"cash for clunkers\" programme. But GM still suffered a $1.15bn loss over the three months to September and there was impatience on Wall Street over a continuing slippage in market share and a drop in revenue per vehicle. Henderson had indicated that he was aiming for a flotation of GM in the second half of 2010 to raise money to pay back US and Canadian taxpayers. But he felt obliged to apologise in November for confusion over GM's handling of its European operations, Vauxhall and Opel, which were to be sold until the board executed an eleventh hour U-turn in favour of maintaining ownership. The most recent strategic challenge facing GM concerns the future of Saab following the collapse last week of a deal to sell the Scandinavian brand to a Swedish sports car company, Koenigsegg. After today's board meeting, GM said it would evaluate potential bids for Saab until the end of December. If there are no viable buyers, Saab will be shut, with the loss of thousands of jobs: \"We will begin an orderly wind down of the global Saab business at that time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
