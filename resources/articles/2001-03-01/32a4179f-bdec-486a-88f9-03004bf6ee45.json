Like the Dyer's, I also had difficulties finding a handbook for walking/climbing in this region. Before I left for my first trip, I learned about the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Club Vosgien who have established and maintained excellent walking paths throughout this region. I purchased a map on arrival in Munster (available at most tourist offices/tabacs in the region) and used it in conjunction with the relevant Michelin green guide (Champagne/Alsace/Lorraine) experience some amazing walks through forests, meadows and stunning lakeside settings. All the paths are well-marked (it is basically impossible to get lost), and are graded by coloured symbols for difficulty. The network of paths is extensive and covers most of the Ballons des Vosges national park and the surrounding area. Hope this is of use! Hannah Fairburn \u0095 We holidayed in Alsace in November of last year and managed some brilliant walking in the Vosges. Get the Circuits Pedestres guidebook from Eglisdorser - a tardis-type bookshop opposite the Psister house in Rue des Marchant, Colmar. It suggests graded walks with detailed large scale maps each with a written guide which can be taken out of the loose bound book and carried in the clear plastic folder, also provided. Cost 98ff. There are some good restaurants in Riquewihr but try La Taverne in La Place des Marche aux Fruits, Colmar for tarte flambe and other regional delicacies. Mary Rawlinson \u0095 We walked in Alsace last summer and found the standard of waymarked paths very good, especially in the Vosges and adjoining valleys. We bought a guidebook locally which had been produced by the local group of the Club Vosgien in the Munster Valley which had 100 walks of varied length and difficulty. The walks we did we found enjoyable and reliably way-marked. The book is in French and German. We didn't find any books in English, which is a reflection of the fairly limited numbers of British visitors away from the main attraction of the Route du Vin! Club Vosgien has a website with pages translated into English. This lists walking books produced by the club covering the whole of Alsace, as well as booklets produced by local groups including the one we purchased. In addition to the website the Club can be contacted by email at info@club-vosgien.com or written to at 16 rue Sainte Helene, 67000 Strasbourg, France. Hope this is helpful, Kate Webster \u0095 The area around Riquewihr is great for walking (We cannot help with climbing information, we're afraid). There are very many footpaths in the immediate area that are waymarked. Different paths have different waymarks and there is a map that faithfully shows the paths, indicating each one's waymark. Using the map it is possible to make up walks to suit one's personal taste. The map is 3718 OT/TOP25, published by IGN (Paris) 1:25,000. We bought our copy in Alsace, but it seems likely that a copy could be obtained in the UK (eg from Stanford's, Long Acre, London). The only guide book that we know of is Vosges Circuit Pedestres by Jean-Luc Theiller, published by Franck Mercier (Annecy) in 1993 (there could well be a more recent edition). This describes about 45 walks, but few of these are in the Riquewihr area. This may also be obtainable in the UK.
