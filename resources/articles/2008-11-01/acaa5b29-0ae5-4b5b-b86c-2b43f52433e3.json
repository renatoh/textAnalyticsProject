It seems Apple hired Papermaster to lead the engineering teams making iPods and iPhones, but IBM says that before he left, after 25 years at Big Blue, he'd agreed to avoid working for any competitor for a year. The story says: Papermaster also argued that there were significant differences between between the two companies because IBM makes big machines for big business and Apple makes little devices for consumers. IBM disagreed. \"Electronic devices large and small are powered by the same type of intelligence, the microprocessor,\" IBM argued. IBM says Papermaster: \"is in possession of significant and highly-confidential IBM trade secrets and know-how, as well as highly sensitive information regarding business strategy and long-term opportunities.\" We don't know much about this is, but Papermaster's reported response -- \"I do not recall a single instance of Apple being described as a competitor of IBM during my entire tenure at IBM\" -- either shows astonishing ignorance or is pure bunk. IBM used to make and still sells PCs that compete with Apple, and Apple launched its Macintosh line with attacks on IBM, in its 1984 Big Brother and 1985 TV commercials. Apple later switched sides, adopting IBM's PowerPC processor, and tried to sell itself to IBM, but they didn't stop competing. (Later, after trashing Intel, Apple switched again, adopting Intel chips for its Macs.) IBM has since sold its PC division to China's Lenovo, but Apple still competes directly against IBM to the extent that it sells any xServe servers. IBM has also been involved in supplying chips for games consoles -- including the Nintendo GameCube and Wii, and Microsoft's Xbox -- and many other devices. It therefore seems quite likely that parts of IBM's PowerPC operation believe they have been competing against PA Semi, a chip company that Apple now owns. Further, PA Semi developed its PA6T-1682M chip based on Power technology licensed from IBM, which suggests Papermaster's inside knowledge of IBM's plans and technologies might just be of interest to his new employer. Was that something he also failed to notice?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
