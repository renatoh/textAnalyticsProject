Given that the Tories won more than 600 seats in the local elections last week, their poll rating has now risen by five points to 34%, and even Iain Duncan Smith's personal rating has improved. Do you not now concede that you have demonstrated a total lack of both qualities? Not satisfied with attacking IDS on polling night, you went on to call him a lump of concrete. People are now describing you as the MP with cement shoes. Don't you think it's time for the Tories to shut up about leadership and get down to the hard work of attacking the government. Its failure to deliver a discernible improvement in the public services, especially health, should be an open goal, even for a Tory with cement shoes. Amanda Dear Amanda, It was precisely because we were going to make gains (my private prediction 500) that I felt it necessary to make my statement at close of poll before the results were out. Why? It was accurately summed up by the headline over Andrew Rawnsley's piece in Sunday's Observer: \"Catastrophic success for the Conservatives\". As expected, the leadership moved to present this as \"terrific\", and IDS claimed it himself as vote of confidence. Thirty-five per cent mid-term, when our core vote is older and more likely to vote anyway, against a Labour party in the country in a mammoth sulk with its leadership and virtually on electoral strike. I know what every other Conservative knows who's been working to get councillors elected over the past month: IDS is an electoral liability. If this factor is holding us back in local elections, just what can we expect it to do in a general election when he will be the focus? Our problem was well illustrated by Guildford. The local party insisted that IDS not come to launch their campaign. He finally came after most of the postal votes had been cast and returned to enjoy the success on the balcony of the newly recaptured town hall. The \"lump of concrete\" remark was not mine, incidentally. It was that of a Guildford activist graphically making the point that these results were achieved in spite of the party leader, not because of him. So what are we going to do about it? There is either the fatalistic view of doing nothing or attempting to put our party in a better position to win. Forgive me for trying the latter. Judgment and timing may be the successful politician's greatest skills. I'm old-fashioned enough to believe integrity is the politician's greatest asset, and if you tell the truth for long enough people will start to recognise it. Crispin Dear Crispin, I despair when your greatest source of comfort is Andrew Rawnsley. It would be hard to find a man less likely to give a favourable interpretation of Tory fortunes. And it is not your integrity I question, but your wisdom. The party has been torn apart by internecine warfare for the best part of a decade. You are simply the latest to participate in this particularly unattractive Tory pastime. The Tories are about as likely to win the next general election as George Galloway is to be invited to Chequers. A period of calm is required during which Conservatives can work hard, reform and rebuild the public's confidence. As Oliver Letwin demonstrates almost daily, even with this leader, a good and decent man can make an impact for the right reasons - attacking the government and forwarding Conservative policy, neither of which you seem inclined to do. When the government is in a complete mess over foundation hospitals, why aren't you attacking them on the issues that really matter to real people? Amanda Dear Amanda, I've never regarded lemmings as startlingly wise. Yet you've made clear that you believe we are destined to pile off the cliff to electoral catastrophe again at the next election, and we would be well advised to shut up and enjoy it. Well, sorry, you're wrong. We can change events. Conservatives need to rediscover some self-confidence. You haven't quite grasped that I'm not trying to push my own internal party policy agenda. I'm not battling for some particular vision of Europe, but the wish for my party to rediscover the desire for power. There has been absolutely no need for Conservatives to go through the collective nervous breakdown we have imposed on ourselves since 1997. Look at the defensiveness of your comment \"all the Conservatives need to do is work hard, reform and rebuild the public confidence\". An imprecation about as convincing as \"arbeit macht frei\". If we go around apologising for our existence and saying we know we've done wrong (pause to imitate Shia Muslim self-flagellating on pilgrimage to Karbala), we'll try and do better (lash), we'll never do it again (lash), we really are humble people now (lash), it's hardly surprising the electorate aren't convinced. I've had enough of apologising. And what for? A total victory in the battle of ideas? Reducing Labour to a 1997 election campaign based on \"Conservatives right, Labour wrong, Vote Labour\"? Labour has stayed on the economic rails only because they followed our expenditure plans for three years and followed a tighter fiscal policy than we would have done and made the Bank of England independent. It's all over now, mind you. The golden economic inheritance (now there's a phrase you could have usefully got much, much more bored with when working for William) has been spent. Debt's rising, taxes spiralling, expenditure out of control and the national accounts as respectable as Enron's. Yes I attacked Labour's energy policy, such as it is; feel free to read my articles, Hansard etc published on my website if nowhere else. Yes I've prepared an energy policy that I will immodestly claim after eight months' work is infinitely superior environmentally and economically to the government's apology for a white paper. And how can I be so confident of this? Because it's based on a free market liberal philosophy that has proved itself time after time to be superior in practice to a centrally controlled model. I'm absolutely inclined to advance Conservative policies. To realise why we've got to get them into practice and the Left out of office, you only have to read Polly Toynbee's suggested manifesto for the rest of the Blair era in today's [Wednesday's] Guardian. And we can't wait for the Islington set to decide we've served our sentence. Britain can't wait an extra four years for us to get off our knees. Crispin Dear Crispin, A wilful misunderstanding of my position does you no credit. I have been called many things, but never an apologist, nor a lemming. Not for me the hand-wringing and self-flagellation of the modernisers. The Conservative crisis requires tough solutions, Conservative solutions. My point is that until people like you shut up and get back to work, there is no chance of a Conservative recovery, let alone a victory. It's all very well carping on about the need for another leader. You should be careful what you wish for. And who would be that leader? You claim integrity in your attack on the incumbent but lack the courage to offer a solution. Much credit has been given to you for your good work as a front bencher. Doesn't it make you feel deeply uncomfortable to be grabbing the headlines by again criticising IDS, as you did on the Today programme this morning, when the government has been crucified for its handling of asylum? Asylum, the NHS, our taxes - these are the issues people care about, not the removal of some unknown Conservative central office apparatchik. What right do you have to do Tony Blair's work for him, roughing up the Tory leader, when there is so much else to fight for - and against? Amanda Dear Amanda, You are right, it is not as easy as just changing the leader. The Conservative crisis as you style it is partly a state of mind, partly a failure to agree an approach to the great national question on Europe and partly a simple personnel issue. In addition, we do have lessons to learn from the \"modernisers\" about a more engaging, liberal and open approach - yet the irony is that the best lesson handed out in this department has been by the distinctly \"old world\" intellectual Oliver Letwin. We are agreed that we will begin to carry conviction when we present some tough Conservative solutions. Personally I would park the European issue in the non-party political area and make clear our platform is that the country has to decide on our future as a nation, wholeheartedly, or renegotiate the whole deal. The halfway house we've occupied since Maastricht has turned out to be the worst of the three options. I feel deeply deeply uncomfortable \"grabbing headlines\" by criticising IDS. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't feel the position were desperate but retrievable. Your judgment - \"The Tories are about as likely to win the next general election as George Galloway is to be invited to Chequers\" - is that the position is irretrievable. All our good work becomes pointless if we accept the inevitability of defeat. It's also soul-destroying for the activists. While many of them were furious with me for spoiling their enjoyment of a good headline result, if I fail on your assessment I can only have damaged a losing position. Yet if I succeed, I believe we can win. That's a one-way bet. The successor: Clarke, Davis, Portillo, Letwin, Howard - they'd all do for me; after all they are all Conservatives who could convince the electorate they have the capacity to be prime minister. Regards Crispin Dear Crispin, Your saying you are uncomfortable grabbing headlines is about as believable as my saying I'm deeply uncomfortable wearing a Wonderbra. No one is forcing you to do it. I return to my original point. We need less of you attacking the leader and more of the lot of you Tory MPs getting down to the hard, unglamorous work of promoting a conservative agenda - small government, low taxes, economic growth, strong defence, law and order and real value for money in public services driven by competition and choice wherever possible. Like many Conservatives, I was disappointed to hear, again on the Today programme, that you will not be attending the Tory bonding session this weekend. We all get a good laugh out of those horrible sweaters - why can't Conservatives do casual, Crispin? I understand many of your parliamentary colleagues also regret your absence. I'm afraid what you regard as your integrity and courageous pursuit of the truth has not made you flavour of the month. You should have gone, as all the men you listed as preferred leaders will be there and you could have got up to some fine plotting in the sauna. Amanda Journalist and former head of media to William Hague Dear Amanda, I've been immersed in that \"unglamorous work\" from a junior front bench position for nearly two years. It's been a matter of serious concern to my ex-boss, Tim Yeo, that it has been almost impossible to get the mainstream media interested in our critique of Labour's conduct of trade and industry. The media, it seems, are much more interested in personalities. So what is the point of all that work if we can't carry it into action because of the tragic failure of our most important personality? We have to do something about it. The difference between us is that you have already accepted defeat and I haven't. I know I speak for millions of disillusioned Conservatives who would be thrilled to bits if we came across as authoritative and credible. Telling the truth is a good start.
