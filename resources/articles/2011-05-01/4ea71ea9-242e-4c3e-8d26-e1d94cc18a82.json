Friends of the Earth has written to the Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary urging him to stand down if the government fails to strengthen its climate targets as advised, including cutting UK greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030. Rejecting the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change would be the first time the UK government has explicitly decided not to cut emissions in line with scientific advice on stopping dangerous climate change. And it would also seriously undermine the whole framework of the Climate Change Act. If the advice is watered down or turned down so early in the life of the Committee on Climate Change, future governments will find it easier to do the same. Failure to set stronger targets would be a betrayal of the pre-election policies of both coalition partners. The Conservative party has frequently said that ministers shouldn't interfere with advice from the committee \u2013 and the Lib Dems have called for a zero-carbon Britain by 2050. Confidence in David Cameron's promise to lead the greenest government ever is already evaporating. A Friends of the Earth report, written by the former chair of the Sustainable Development Commission, Jonathon Porritt, concludes that the government's first year in office has been woeful, with little or no progress in over three-quarters of its green policies. It's time for the Liberal Democrats and Chris Huhne to make a stand and show some real political courage on climate change.
