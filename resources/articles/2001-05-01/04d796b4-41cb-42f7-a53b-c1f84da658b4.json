The departure of Redknapp and his No2 Frank Lampard is almost certain to end the West Ham career of Frank Lampard Jnr. The midfielder will cost around \u00a310m and Leeds are leading a group of interested clubs which includes Arsenal, Tottenham and Aston Villa. Little over 24 hours after leaving West Ham, Redknapp described the idea of managing Southampton as \"attractive\". The 54-year-old lives on the south coast in Poole, and Southampton, who are looking to replace Glenn Hoddle, have put out feelers. \"I've not spoken to their chairman Rupert Lowe,\" said Redknapp, who stressed that he had not walked out of West Ham to step into another job. \"But I would be happy to discuss it if he were to call me.\" West Ham, meanwhile, were beginning the task of finding Redknapp's successor. Curbishley, who grew up in east London and began his playing career at Upton Park, is the favourite to take the job and is understood to have a clause in his contract at Charlton which allows him to consider an approach from West Ham. His comment that he was \"flattered\" to be associated with the vacancy at a club for whom he has \"always had an affection\" will worry Charlton supporters. Even his pledge to stay at Charlton, where he has been in joint or sole charge since 1991, sounded unemphatic. \"There is still much to be achieved at Charlton,\" he said, \"and I want to be involved in the ongoing development of the club.\" However Charlton's managing director Peter Varney said he had spoken to Curbishley and was confident of keeping his man, who would cost West Ham \u00a32m in compensation. \"I think Alan Curbishley will be at Charlton for quite a period to come,\" Varney said. \"He's a thoroughly decent, honourable bloke who's done a fantastic job and he genuinely wants to move it on another notch.\" If West Ham fail to lure Curbishley or turn their attention elsewhere, Stuart Pearce looks a strong candidate. He is already at the club in a playing capacity, is highly respected by his team-mates and has had brief managerial experience at Nottingham Forest. George Graham's odds were slashed from 6-1 to 9-4 second favourite yesterday after the bookmakers William Hill received two three-figure bets in the Upton Park area. But he would be an unpopular choice with many West Ham fans. Redknapp has sought advice from the Professional Footballers' Association over settling the remaining two years of his West Ham contract. It appears one of the reasons for his abrupt departure was that the board wanted him to sell players such as Lampard and Trevor Sinclair, a target for Tottenham, before buying. Either way, Lampard Jnr's days at the club look over now his father and uncle have gone. The 22-year-old's agent Steve Kutner said he did not expect his client to play in West Ham's final match at Middlesbrough a week tomorrow. A summer move looks certain. \"It's left a bad feeling for him,\" said Kutner. \"A lot of clubs like Frank, but it's down to West Ham. All I can say is that Frank's upset.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
