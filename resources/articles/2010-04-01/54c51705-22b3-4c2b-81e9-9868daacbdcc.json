The range and depth of the charges stacked against him are such that it is difficult to see how he will have a satisfactory answer to all of them. And bear in mind that none of this has happened out of the blue. Rumours have existed, even as far as I am aware, for the past 18 months, all relating to the charge sheet now laid before him. Maybe something would have happened in any case before Modi went his one arrogant step too far, lit the touch-paper and precipitated events. A megalomaniac faces being brought down not so much by others, as by his own huge sense of self-aggrandisement. Far from the earlier picture he painted of himself as someone too busy to actually watch cricket, he has, at his insistence, been seen surrounded by acolytes and stars on the replay screen at his matches more often than is palatable. He appeared to see himself as bigger than the cricket. Then Twitter, twitter, twit. What a fool. He came to believe in his own omnipotence as \"commissioner\" (a title bestowed by himself, apparently), a man in sole charge of one of the world's largest sporting brands (another grating phrase, but one that this financially obsessed individual would use) who thought that he could rule autocratically and unquestioned. Easy, I suppose, when even those who should know better, or at least have some dignity, have fawned spectacularly in pursuit of his hand-outs. With the exception of the England and Wales Cricket Board, can any of the governing bodies of the major cricket nations truthfully say they are not in hock to Modi and the Indian cricket board? In that lies the root of Modi's antipathy to England, and the board chairman Giles Clarke in particular. He may have done some financial fawning of his own in the past, elements of which he might not be too proud, but Clarke at least had Modi and his methods rumbled from an early stage. How, though, was it allowed to come to this? My take when it first started was not a negative one in that then, and now, I understand and accept that T20 is a great spectacle, has brought a new dimension to cricket playing and watching, and can be exhilarating if kept in context. It is a fantastic addition to the cricketing genre. But the dollar signs that Chris Gayle texted so enthusiastically to Kevin Pietersen on another occasion worried me as symbolic. Things that from nowhere rocket so rapidly into a billion dollar stratosphere \u2013 and bear in mind that until India won the World T20 in South Africa, they were steadfastly opposed to it because of the reduced opportunity for TV advertising \u2013 can plummet just as rapidly. Simply, I saw the dot.com boom-and-bust as a potential metaphor for the Indian Premier League. It hasn't come to that \u2013 not yet anyway \u2013 but alleged financial misdemeanours are another thing entirely. So, again, how was it allowed to happen? My mind is cast back to the waves of criticism levelled at the ECB in the aftermath of its ill-fated liaison with Allen Stanford. His downfall was followed by questions regarding due diligence. Why had the ECB accepted money and made agreements with a man who is accused of being one of history's great fraudsters? To respond that the only criterion was that he could pay (and pay he did, albeit allegedly with other people's money) was poor judgment, but I did sympathise with the idea that if the US financial services commission had not nailed him in the preceding years, it was asking a bit much of the ECB with its resource. The lesson from this does not appear to have been learned, though. If something appears to be too good to be true it generally is, and Modi and his IPL vision seemed just that. Cricketers, understandably perhaps, fell over themselves to gain contracts. I wonder how many of them questioned the probity of IPL? Or did they just see a cash cow? And how alert in their due diligence have been those from this country who have done, would have done, or were considering doing franchise or other deals with Modi? IPL will survive and be better for it. But it cannot be the same. Some of the gilt has rubbed off and there is base metal beneath. Let's see who stays in and who runs for cover when the Revenue digs ever deeper. Modi, if indeed he does finally sink, is not likely to drown alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
