A letter from the retired generals and admirals, timed for the 14th anniversary of the legislation, calls on Congress to throw out the restriction. \"Those of us signing this letter have dedicated our lives to defending the rights of our citizens to believe whatever they wish,\" the letter says. The provision was introduced by the Clinton administration as a compromise. Bill Clinton came to office in 1992 promising to open up fully the military to gay and lesbian personnel but backtracked in the face of vociferous opposition. Since 1993 about 10,000 men and women have been sacked from the military under the policy. In recent years the numbers have declined, to 612 in 2006. The subject continues to divide the parties, with the Democrat candidates for the 2008 presidency uniformly in favour of repeal, and the Republicans all wanting to keep the legislation. The issue shot to the top of the media agenda this week after a retired general, Keith Kerr, raised a question about \"don't ask, don't tell\" at the first Republican debate sponsored by CNN and YouTube. CNN had been unaware that Kerr was a member of a panel on gay and lesbian issues advising Hillary Clinton's campaign. CNN has said that it would not have used the question had it known of his role. The Pentagon has made it clear that it will follow the lead of Congress on this issue, but to date there has been little appetite on the part of congressional leaders of either main party to expend political capital on changing the law. There also remains powerful resistance among senior military chiefs. In March the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Peter Pace, said: \"I do not believe the United States is well served by a policy that says it is OK to be immoral in any way.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
