Scottish football's answer to Aintree's four-and-a-half miles and 30 fences is a course that covers 10 months and 38 matches; astonishingly, Rangers go into this last day of a thrillingly eccentric season ahead of Celtic only by virtue of having scored one more goal than their great rivals. In the four weeks since Martin O'Neill's reigning champions closed in on Alex McLeish's challengers by winning what was believed to be the final Old Firm match of the season at Ibrox, the prospect of the play-off dreaded by the football, civic and police authorities has become increasingly likely. Should the protagonists be inseparable by all criteria after Rangers have played Dunfermline at home and Celtic have done with Kilmarnock away, the showdown will take place at Hampden Park on Tuesday week. Such an event may have the followers of both clubs salivating, but it will be something of an embarrassment for executives of the SPL. It was after a championship-deciding confrontation at Parkhead in 1999, when Rangers' 3-0 victory so inflamed the home crowd that the referee Hugh Dallas was hit by a coin that split his forehead, that the league officials vowed never again to schedule a match between the Glasgow giants that could allow one of them to secure the title. This was why Celtic were forced to visit Ibrox on 27 April, less than 60 hours after their return from a rigorous Uefa Cup semi-final against Boavista in Oporto. That caused consternation and controversy, with O'Neill and his then chief executive, Ian McLeod, accusing the SPL of favouring Rangers by handicapping Celtic. But, in their haste to eradicate the possibility of a conclusive meeting between the only two teams who have a chance of lifting the championship trophy, they failed to consider the possibility of the most inflammable situation of all. Even if the chances of it being required seemed remote, the play-off solution was left in the statute book, when it could, indeed should, have been replaced with an alternative. This would not have taken a colossal leap of the imagination, since a perfectly reasonable and acceptable resolution exists in the major international tournaments under the auspices of Uefa and Fifa. When clubs or countries contesting mini-leagues in the Champions League and the World Cup finish level, the results of matches played against each other prevent the need for a play-off. On this basis, Celtic would retain the title they have won for the past two years, but, curiously, this merely underlines the credit Rangers deserve for the tenacity and consistency they have shown in taking the contest to the final day. The Parkhead club's two victories and one draw from the four-match series during the campaign point to their general superiority over their arch-rivals, but their tendency to drop points against opponents from further down the league has rendered their success in head-to-heads with Rangers inconclusive, for a change. When Celtic overcame a number of disadvantages to win at Ibrox last month, followed by a 4-1 defeat of Dunfermline Athletic and a 4-0 thrashing of Motherwell while Rangers drew 2-2 draw at Dundee, the Ibrox club's eight-point lead was not only wiped out, but O'Neill's team went ahead on goal difference. It is a monument to McLeish's ability to restore his players' spirit that they have since held their nerve and have been more impressive than at any other stage in the season by beating Kilmarnock 4-0 at home and taking the infinitely tougher assignment away to Heart of Midlothian in their stride, winning 2-0. O'Neill's tribute to his players' extraordinary resilience the other day, in fact, amounts to a simultaneous compliment to Rangers. 'We could finish with 97 points on Sunday and not win the league,' said the Irishman. 'We won it last year with 103 and the year before with 97. That is fantastic consistency.' That Rangers appear certain to match, or even surpass, Celtic's total becomes even more meritorious when it is remembered that they ended last season 18 points and 21 goals adrift of the champions. The extraordinary rate of improvement is attributable entirely to McLeish, who is working with most of the underachieving squad he inherited from Dick Advocaat 18 months ago. Given the impetus Rangers have gained since faltering a few weeks ago, failure to beat Dunfermline on their last outing before this Saturday's Tennent's Scottish Cup final against Dundee at Hampden is unimaginable. The margin of victory is the only imponderable about a match that looks acutely imbalanced, although the Rangers manager insists that it would be an insult to his counterpart, Jimmy Calderwood, even to discuss the game in those terms. It seems hardly credible that Celtic are at serious risk of going through this remarkable season without winning a trophy. Having besmirched some fancy reputations - including those of Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers from the Premiership - on their way to Wednesday's heartbreakingly narrow defeat by Porto in the Uefa Cup final in Seville, they have shown themselves to be a formidable force. The physical and mental fortitude O'Neill's players have displayed during their pursuit of honours at home and abroad has been almost exhausting to watch. Like Rangers, they face opponents today who have been, in effect, on holiday since last weekend, when they were left with nothing to play for. Even the enervating demands of the extra-time marathon in the sweltering temperature of the Andalusian capital last week are unlikely to bring O'Neill's men to their knees. But even their most committed fans have come to fear that whatever they achieve at Kilmarnock is unlikely to be enough.
