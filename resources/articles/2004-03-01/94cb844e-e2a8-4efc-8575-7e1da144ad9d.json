This afternoon the prison service was taking urgent steps to find spare capacity in the system in order to take some pressure off. But it admitted that prisoner numbers have gone up every week since the beginning of the year. \"The situation is not ideal,\" a spokeswoman said. The total number of prisoners reached 74,960 today - setting a record for the fourth week running and up to 183 more than last Friday. The service's \"usable operational capacity\" is 75,191 - just 231 places away. Another 2,000 places are available in the system but they may not be suitable for all types of prisoner and depend on gender, age and security risk. The National Association of Probation Officers said the system was in crisis. Its assistant general secretary, Harry Fletcher, said the rise in prison population predicted in the autumn had been higher than expected. He added that the continuing culture of punishment by prison sentence had almost certainly helped to push the situation to its current state. He said: \"Since Labour came to power they have talked the prison population up. The general gist of ministerial statements since 1987 has been 'lock them up'.\" The union, which represents probation officers, says the crisis can only be halted if ministers start to 'talk down' the prison population, link fines to people's ability to pay and resource the probation service so that it can cope with additional workloads. Mr Fletcher warned: \"If the probation service was faced with any extra workload at the moment we would collapse.\" The director of the prison reform trust, Juliet Lyons, said squeezing prisoners into every available space put staff under intolerable pressure and threatened the safety and security of prisons. She said: \"The government is responsible for failing to foresee the extent of the crisis facing our prisons and acting earlier to reduce prison numbers by diverting petty offenders in need of drug treatment and the mentally ill away from custody.\" The prison service said it was not its responsibility to explain why the prison service was nearing full \"usable operational\" capacity. A spokeswoman said: \"That isn't for us to answer. We are committed to taking these people sent to us by the courts.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
