The University and College Union (UCU), which organised the strike, worried that university management would search recordings to identify who would be engaging in industrial action, and introduce measures to lessen its impact. The union had good reason to be concerned: during last year\u2019s strikes, the head of Edinburgh University\u2019s law school emailed staff asking them to upload recorded versions of their lectures so students wouldn\u2019t miss out on teaching. The UCU and the National Union of Students were furious. Soon after, Edinburgh University\u2019s policy on lecture recordings changed: it became the first UK university to explicitly ban the rerunning of lecture recordings during industrial action. \u201cIt was a very short-sighted move on behalf of the department that did it, but the response has been to create the most progressive and comprehensive policy in the UK around lecture recordings,\u201d says Emily Nordmann, a University of Glasgow academic who has studied lecture recording technology. It\u2019s a time of change for universities, but policies are struggling to keep up with rising student numbers and the growing infiltration of technology in lecture halls. At many institutions, teaching is recorded through a system called Panopto (or ReCap) and uploaded to digital learning environments like Blackboard, so it\u2019s accessible in students\u2019 own time. According to Panopto\u2019s own figures, more than 1,000 institutions worldwide use it to record more than 100 hours of video every month. The old idea of \u201cthe sage on the stage\u201d that has pervaded higher education for thousands of years is disappearing. And some people are worried. Academics fear that on-demand recordings, which some have called the \u201cNetflixisation of academia\u201d, will affect attendance. They also worry about less obvious consequences: it could be used to bust strikes, it could be a watching eye monitoring their performance, and eventually it could replace them. But do they have genuine reason to be concerned? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the data proves them wrong,\u201d says Nordmann. But she disagrees with the gloomier predictions: \u201cIt\u2019s a tool in the same way a textbook is for a student.\u201d A survey by Newcastle University\u2019s students\u2019 union found that around three-quarters of students say they very rarely use recordings as a reason not to attend lectures \u2013 apart from disabled students or those living far away who struggle to afford the daily commute. \u201cLecture recording is very beneficial for vulnerable groups of students,\u201d explains Pablo Charro de la Fuente, education officer at Newcastle University. And when one in five students are from outside the UK, recordings can also be a good way to revisit material they didn\u2019t fully understand. Despite being used last year in Edinburgh, the fear of lecture recordings being used to bust strikes is overstated, reckons Nordmann. UCU general secretary Jo Grady describes the rerunning of old lectures as \u201cineffectual tactics\u201d which have \u201cmerely hardened strikers\u2019 resolve and angered students\u201d. There\u2019s also a longstanding worry that reruns could become the norm, even outside of strike periods. \u201cI\u2019ve heard individual staff members express concern they\u2019ll be replaced by a videotape. When the ReCap policy is updated, we\u2019ve always relayed that that\u2019s not the purpose of it,\u201d says Joe Barton, representation and research coordinator at Newcastle University\u2019s students\u2019 union. Since the intellectual property for the content of lecture recordings generally belongs to the performer, it\u2019s unlikely that recordings will replace lecturers. This hasn\u2019t quelled any anxieties among staff: Jisc, which provides tech support and advice to universities, has been compelled to produce guidance for fearful lecturers. The problem is that each university has different policies when it comes to lecture recording. A survey of 35 UK institutions by Nordmann and colleagues found that 11 had staff opt in to recording, 19 required staff to opt out, and four had different approaches depending on individual schools. But the evidence is that students don\u2019t want a teacherless classroom. \u201cI don\u2019t think that interaction with the lecturer can be replaced,\u201d says De la Fuente. \u201c[It] wouldn\u2019t be welcomed from the student body.\u201d \u201cThe community side of lecture attendance is the most important thing,\u201d adds Nordmann. \u201cStudents can probably learn the same amount from the video but it\u2019s actually being there in the room with the person that makes the difference.\u201d There are also concerns that the creeping advent of the red light and camera or microphone near the lectern is a way to spy on staff members and monitor how they teach. In reality, almost every university policy Nordmann has read explicitly states that recordings can\u2019t be used for the purposes of performance management. Nevertheless, some academics think that recording lectures has changed the way they teach \u2013 whether it makes them less spontaneous and more likely to stick to the script, or wary of cracking jokes in case it comes out wrong and is captured on camera. As the demographics of those teaching change, concerns around recording will likely disappear. \u201cI see a difference between people who have been lecturing for 20 or 30 years and people who are newer to it, or who are perhaps more used to having every moment of their lives filmed and recorded,\u201d says Nordmann. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always been recorded, I don\u2019t think about it.\u201d Additionally, most universities allow lecturers to opt out of recording some lectures, or to pause recordings at sensitive moments \u2013 though often they don\u2019t know they can. \u201cStudents understand,\u201d says Nordmann. \u201cIf you treat them like adults and explain why some lectures are recorded and some aren\u2019t, they generally are fine with it.\u201d Regardless of some lecturers\u2019 reservations, the tide is changing. Between 70 and 80% of British universities now have lecture recording technology in their lecture rooms. \u201cAs video has become commonplace in education, academics are using it like any other technology: they experiment with it, learn what it does well, and find their own applications for it in the classroom,\u201d says Peter Ingle, general manager for Panopto in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Nordmann describes the shift as similar to how PowerPoint transformed presentations. \u201cThey\u2019ve now become ubiquitous,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the comparison we\u2019re looking at.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
