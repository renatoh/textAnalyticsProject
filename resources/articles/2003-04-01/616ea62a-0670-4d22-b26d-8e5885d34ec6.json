He then cracked a raw egg into each glass and filled them to the brim with sherry. \"Nobody is going until every drop has been finished,\" he said, downing the cocktail in one and banging the glass down as if it were a tequila slammer. \"Every Friday after training he'd put us through it,\" Dean Kiely, the Charlton goalkeeper, recalls of his days under Warnock at Bury. \"You weren't allowed home until they were all gone. There would be players on their knees, heaving and gagging, but you'd make sure you got it down. No messing. It was his way of saying: 'We stand and fall together.' And you wouldn't want to let him down.\" Everyone in football seems to have a story about Warnock. Ask Stan Ternent his view of the Sheffield United manager and he will talk about \"a prat I can't abide\". Ask Phil Thompson, Gary Megson, Sam Allardyce, Micky Adams, St\u00e9phane Henchoz and many more and, privately, chances are they will not be rooting for Warnock in tomorrow's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Old Trafford. \"He's not the most liked manager,\" says Derek Pavis, his former chairman at Notts County, \"but the thing with Neil is, he doesn't mind getting up people's noses. I, for one, wish him well. But there are a lot of people who would happily see him take a fall. Him and Ternent, for example, can't stand the sight of each other. There was a clash of personalities, a few things have happened since and it's just snowballed.\" So much so that Ternent, who claims Warnock once sent an emissary to eavesdrop on his team-talk, says: \"I wouldn't waste my breath on him. But if I was alone with him for just one minute, I ...\" In the Burnley manager's autobiography there is a section devoted to explaining what physical damage he would like to inflict upon Warnock, but then a notice is emblazoned across the page: \"THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE HAS BEEN DELETED FOR LEGAL REASONS!\" Perhaps, after 17 years in management, Warnock should have learned that it does not always pay to speak your mind in a sport where it is increasingly fashionable for managers to see nothing and say even less. A few years ago, he was asked in a magazine interview what he would do if he were appointed manager of Sheffield Wednesday. Warnock, a lifelong United fan raised in what he describes as one of the city's \"bread-and-marge\" districts and who once compared Brian Deane's departure from Bramall Lane to the shooting of President Kennedy, replied: \"As long as the whole of my salary was paid within 28 days, I would buy so many tosspots - although, come to think of it, their current squad would do - and fuck 'em up so badly. Then I'd retire to Cornwall and spend the rest of my life laughing my fucking head off.\" He later claimed it was an off-the-record chat, although United's then chairman Derek Dooley still felt it necessary to make a public apology. On the offensive \"The one thing he has suffered with - I don't like saying this, but it's perfectly true - is that he speaks his mind and has a nasty habit of falling out with his chairman,\" says Pavis. \"He did it at Oldham, Bury, Huddersfield, Plymouth and he did it with me. If he had stopped this [habit] he would have been able to manage in the Premiership but, as it is, people have been scared to take him on. \"That's a crying shame because if you read his CV he's one of the top three managers in the game. I had six managers in 15 years and he was the best I ever worked with. He could turn an average player into a good player, a good player into a better player and a better player into a bloody brilliant player. \"But like most managers he liked to get his own way, and when he didn't get it he would play deaf-and-dumb pudding. Eventually he would come round, of course. But he liked to make his point.\" Pavis remembers Warnock offering some extra-curricular work. \"He trained as a chiropodist and every three or four weeks he would come to my house with his scalpels. I had a terrible in-growing toenail and he would dig it out for me. But then, get this, he would send me a whopping great bill - I used to think it was a bit bloody ironic that I was employing him and he would still charge me. But that's Neil, I suppose.\" The danger for Warnock is that football loves a row so much his various contre temps tend to overshadow his achievements as a manager. Thus it is that tomorrow Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will be in the opposite dugout to a man who once described himself as more unpopular than Osama bin Laden and, of the players who have worked with him, there are some who would rather nail their hands to the floor than break bread with him. Warnock has even featured on the \"1,000 People More Annoying than Mick Hucknall\" website. \"I hate Neil Warnock,\" the striker Peter Swan once said, talking about the time he played under Warnock at Bury and Plymouth. \"He's a prick.\" Even yesterday, before the biggest game of his managerial career, Warnock was on the offensive, complaining loudly that his squad had not been permitted to train on the Old Trafford pitch. Overall, however, his players paint a different image from the confrontational, referee-baiting, egotistical loudmouth who has been portrayed so often since, notoriously, four Sheffield United players were sent off against West Brom 13 months ago, forcing the abandonment of the game. \"You see him on the sideline effing and blinding but there's much more to him than that,\" says Kiely. \"He's a good manager and a good bloke, too. He's a family man and he was forever arranging parties and get-togethers - not just for the players but their wives and children, too. \"I found him very easy to get on with, far removed from the image of ranting and raving and winding up people. He's not that bad, honestly. And nobody that knows him will be surprised by how well Sheffield United are doing. \"The really big clubs seem to have been intimidated by the way he carries on but there are no hidden agenda or politics with him, he keeps everything simple and he's got a knack of getting his players to walk through brick walls.\" At Bramall Lane they have also had the sherry-and-raw-eggs trick. \"He can be like a friend as well as the boss,\" says the midfielder Michael Tonge. \"He finds time to speak to you personally, which players appreciate, and he's not afraid to put an arm around you. A lot is said about him but I'd say his man-management skills are fantastic - he's the sort of manager who knows everyone's strengths and weaknesses.\" And that is why maybe, just maybe, tomorrow's semi-final is not the formality that everyone expects. FOOTBALL'S MAVERICK MANAGERS John Beck Best known for his eccentricities while propelling Cambridge United through the lower leagues during the early 1990s, Beck's psychology inspired his own players and enraged opponents. He would leave notes in the changing rooms with words of wisdom from Greek philosophers, force his players to take pre-match cold showers and was once alleged to have head-butted his centre-forward Steve Claridge during one trademark fit of rage. His gamesmanship included under-inflating opponents' warm-up balls and spiking the opposition's half-time tea sugar with salt. Egil Olsen The former Norway manager arrived at Selhurst Park to announce that there were only two teams on the planet he had dreamed of managing - Brazil and Wimbledon. He had a dishevelled appearance and penchant for wellington boots and was forever eager to air his Marxist-Leninist political views. As the Dons tumbled down the Premiership, he returned to Norway to pick up an award four days before a crunch match at Bradford. Wimbledon lost 3-0 and Olsen lost his job. Too crazy for the Crazy Gang. Herbert Chapman This dapper, portly little man left the First Division champions Huddersfield Town in 1925 for a mediocre top-flight club called Arsenal. His legacy (Chapman died of pneumonia while still at the helm in January 1934) was to transform Arsenal into what was then the world's greatest club side. His visionary proposals included replacing the England team's selection committee with a single manager. Brian Clough Cocksure, headstrong and opinionated, Clough won a league title with Derby in 1972 only to resign a year later, prompting the players to threaten to strike in protest. Stood as a Labour MP in Derby during a brief spell as manager of Brighton. ('He was one of the best socialists I've ever met,' said Michael Foot) then spent 44 days at Leeds, labelling his new team 'cheats' for their physical style, before breaking Liverpool's domestic dominance with Nottingham Forest. He would often motivate his side by singing Fly me to the Moon in the changing rooms, as well as giving his players pre-match brandy, having toughened them up by making them run through clumps of stinging nettles on cold winter mornings. He was banned from the touchline for hitting a fan who had run on to the pitch at the City Ground, and once he flashed a v-sign at the Forest supporters.
