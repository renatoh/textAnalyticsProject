The Scot, who turned 62 last New Year's Eve, underwent surgery last week to have the device fitted to combat the effects of supraventricular tachycardia, a disturbance of his heart rhythm which first flared up last December and necessitated \"electrozap\" treatment - as was given to Tony Blair last October - at the Alexandra hospital in Cheadle. An irregular heartbeat is considered a minor cardiovascular complaint, with Ferguson back to take training the following day and bullish yesterday in his insistence that it was \"business as usual\" at Carrington. But confirmation that United's manager of 18 years required the insertion of the pacemaker has added to the sense of uncertainty, if not full-scale crisis, that has engulfed Old Trafford in recent weeks. \"The club knew I was having it done,\" said Ferguson, who underwent 90 minutes of surgery under a local anaesthetic last week to have the electrical gadget, no larger than a matchbox, fitted. \"I informed [the chief executive] David Gill a while ago. This was always an option for me. It follows on from the little blip I had at the end of last year and there are no long-term worries. \"The advice I got was that I should get it done because it was a simple, easy procedure which made the problem controllable. It doesn't affect the job. There must be a million and a half people who have pacemakers in this country. \"I feel better with it, I must say. Much better. There are absolutely no long-term health implications and the board have no problem with it at all.\" Ferguson appeared relaxed, even cheerful, yesterday despite the downturn in United's fortunes which has arguably left him enduring his most traumatic spell of recent years, with Tuesday's Champions League elimination to Porto coming hard on the heels of the bitter feud with the shareholder John Magnier. That has now been resolved, though the Scot complained of huge intrusions into his private life while the legal dispute rumbled on. Indeed, he stressed that he had only revealed details of his condition yesterday after learning that details of his private medical records had been leaked. \"I thought I'd be open about it in view of one tabloid planning to run a story to sensationalise it,\" explained Ferguson, who signed a new one-year rolling contract in January to choke speculation about his potential retirement. \"I wanted to give my version of why I've had it fitted.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, whose Arsenal team United trail by nine points, said: \"I was amazed to hear how quickly you can recover from something like that because it was only done last week. Of course I wish him well. Even if we have a fierce fight [on the pitch], you want people to keep good health.\" That battle will recommence this weekend and Ferguson found time for a swipe in Arsenal's general direction. \"Last week there were a couple of bad decisions - Louis Saha being brought down against Fulham, then Paul Scholes's disallowed goal against Porto - and they may shape our season,\" said the United manager, whose injury-ravaged team venture into their first derby at the City of Manchester Stadium tomorrow. \"But it's such an unpredictable game that the same thing could happen to Arsenal. \"They got their break against us at Old Trafford with us missing a last-minute penalty. Everyone thought they'd get bigger punishments from the Football Association [for the scenes at the final whistle]. They didn't, and that was a break. \"Since then they've done fantastically well. But it's hard to imagine a team going throughout the season without a blip. Football can rear itself in a way you don't expect and smack you in the teeth.\" Arsenal travel to Ewood Park this afternoon almost exactly a year after they lost 2-0 at Blackburn, a defeat which, combined with United's 1-0 win at Aston Villa, cut their lead at the top to two points. Yet Ferguson's problems this time around are complicated by his crippling injury list. He has only three available defenders. \"My job is to make sure the players are not feeling sorry for themselves,\" he added. \"I read what Gary Neville was saying about Rio Ferdinand's suspension and other injuries, but there's a danger you start falling into that trap. \"Every year, if we lose a series of games, people start talking about the end of an era. We are still looking ahead - that was part of the plan last year, to build a team that was going to be there for a few years rather than just one more year. I never thought this was just a season of transition. This is a challenge. Now we have to do something about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
