I think we\u2019re all damaged in some ways,\u201d says Aaron Pedersen. \u201cWhen I was younger I never thought I had any way of breaking through the hardships.\u201d It\u2019s a stark admission of vulnerability from the 47-year-old Arrernte-Arabana actor, but perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising. If one thing defines Pedersen\u2019s work, it\u2019s gravitas. He has a seemingly natural, intrinsic ability to project both great strength and great sorrow. \u201cI grew up in a number of homes and I grew up without a lot of structure,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand now that damage is part of the journey. Heartbreak. Loss. Gain.\u201d That journey has inevitably been gradual. No artist wakes up one day and is suddenly brilliant, but the 2013 feature film Mystery Road represented something of a turning point in Pedersen\u2019s artistic oeuvre. Director Ivan Sen\u2019s outback neo-noir marked Pedersen\u2019s transition from a talented performer to one of the greatest Australian actors of his generation. After it, Pedersen (whose early work includes TV\u2019s Water Rats and The Secret Life of Us) started operating on a higher level. In the last half decade he has delivered several extraordinary performances including in the musical Spear, the campsite thriller Killing Ground, Mystery Road\u2019s sequel Goldstone (also directed by Sen) and the series\u2019 six-part television spin-off (directed by Rachel Perkins). He is currently on Australian screens in a supporting role in the new series of Jack Irish. Responding to my thoughts on his post-Mystery Road second wind, Pedersen says: \u201cThat probably has a lot to do with Ivan. He approached me very differently to any other director. With Mystery Road he had absolute confidence in me. He said: \u2018Don\u2019t rush it, Aaron. Take your time. Breathe.\u2019 \u201cIvan\u2019s structure of film-making feels old school. Actors have to have conversations not just with dialogue but with silences. I got a lot out of that. Also, acting can only get better with life. That\u2019s the beautiful thing about it. Life is a great teacher.\u201d I share with Pedersen another of my theories about Australian cinema: that the history of film-making in this country contains three great alpha male actors. The first was Chips Rafferty (a star in the 1940s, 50s and 60s) who stood for old-fashioned, possibly a little cliche, values: a hard day\u2019s labour, a fair go, the Anzac spirit. The second was Jack Thompson, the virile, hard-drinking \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d who was a seismic force throughout Australian cinema\u2019s renaissance in the 70s. The third is Pedersen. He brings something largely absent in the work of Rafferty and Thompson: a painfully damaged masculinity, projecting strength and vulnerability in equal measure. \u201cI always remind myself that my audience is human,\u201d he says. \u201cTherefore we have to be human, play human, reveal the humanness of who we are. Audiences gravitate towards that.\u201d Pedersen reflected on his difficult youth in the 2006 SBS documentary My Brother Vinnie. He and his seven siblings spent their childhood in commission housing and foster homes, under the protection of the child welfare system. They had an alcoholic mother and grew up around violence. One of Pedersen\u2019s earliest memories is of crying and screaming while he watched his mother being violently assaulted. The actor says his younger brother Vinnie, who has cerebral palsy, is his greatest inspiration. Vinnie gave Pedersen duty of care, coming to live with him in Sydney after their grandmother died in 1997. Pedersen is the ambassador for National Carers Week. He says he \u201cwas a carer before I started acting\u201d and that \u201cmy real job \u2013 the real reason I am here \u2013 is first and foremost to be a carer. That will never change.\u201d Vinnie is his number one teacher: \u201cFor impulses, for being in the moment, for living life as it is, for turning life into something magic. Vinnie is my shadow and I am his. I love him massively and I honour him in many ways.\u201d Pedersen\u2019s performance in Spear \u2013 the 2015 full-length feature debut of acclaimed Bangarra Dance Theatre director Stephen Page \u2013 might not be one of his most famous roles, but it is one of his most affecting. The actor is a whirlwind of emotion as the distraught and homeless \u201cSuicide Man\u201d, who struggles to reconcile his Indigenous heritage with contemporary western society. Shortly before he took on the role, one of Pedersen\u2019s brothers took his own life. \u201cThat\u2019s how real it is. That\u2019s how close it is to reality. It\u2019s like a constant open wound you can\u2019t heal,\u201d Pedersen says. \u201cWe filmed my scenes twice, as a wide shot and as a close-up. I said to Stephen: \u2018I don\u2019t really want to be going over this with you, brother. I don\u2019t want to do it any more than twice. I don\u2019t want to intellectualise it. I don\u2019t want to break it down.\u2019 It was close to both of us. Very, very close.\u201d Discussing the film\u2019s core theme \u2013 the challenge Indigenous Australians face in reconciling their ancient history with the western world \u2013 Pedersen says: \u201cI am five generations from being a full-blown warrior in this nation. It\u2019s not too long ago. Was I born 200 years too late or 200 years too early? I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve always believed in a sense of the land and an understanding of my people. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed, when I walk into a room or do my work, that I\u2019ve got all the men, all those ancestors past, standing right behind me. A million men are here with me right now in this room. They are with me now during this interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think men should always think, always carry themselves. They should never feel like they are walking down a street alone. I\u2019ve always felt that I have a world of warriors right behind me, hovering at my shoulders.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
