The OECD have publicly stated tax evasion is not only bad for markets, but also allows tax evaders to obtain a competitive advantage. This is not because they are more efficient and innovative, but because they are better at hiding profit from tax authorities. Tax dodging deprives governments of the revenues they need to provide basic services. Either everyone else needs to pay more tax, or we see further cuts to public services. It costs developing countries even more. Research commissioned by Christian Aid in 2009 found developing countries were cheated out of at least $160bn a year by two types of tax evasion by multinational corporations \u2013 more than the $120bn they collectively got in aid. Ending this would provide some of these countries a path out of poverty; they would have the revenue to provide services to their own people, and would be less likely to be caught in cycles of debt and aid dependency. Unfortunately, the current level of confidentiality provided to multinational corporations by the taxation administration act 1953 makes assessment of profit shifting by multinational corporations operating in Australia very difficult, if not impossible. Only the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the multinational corporations engaged have access to the detailed information that would allow a thorough assessment to be made. However, even the ATO would be unable to make a detailed assessment of the extent of tax evasion taking place. They are only likely to see the tip of the iceberg. Tax dodging reduces the reportable profit of a multinational corporation, so profit shifting is unlikely to show up in examining effective tax rates paid by companies. The best guesses of a range of researchers would suggest that the losses to Australian tax revenue from multinational tax avoidance are in the billions each year, and only likely to grow without effective action. So far, the current Australian government has been strong on speaking up about the threat of multinational corporate tax avoidance or evasion to the Commonwealth budget, but its actions have been modest at best, and in some cases downright pathetic. At the better end of the Australian government\u2019s efforts have been some tightening up in the rules governing the opportunities of multinational corporations to use internal trading to shift profits to parts of the corporation located in tax havens. Australia has also been at the forefront of sharing information with other tax authorities around the world, to make detection of tax avoidance and tax evasion easier. It was quick to sign up to the international convention on mutual administrative assistance on tax matters. Australia has been supporting the development of an OECD program, Tax Inspectors Without Borders, which will aim to deploy existing and retired tax officials from OECD countries into the tax authorities of developing countries. This will provide on-the-job training for tax authorities in the developing countries. Such initiatives can have spectacular results, with USAID support worth US$ 5.3m in 2004-10 to improve tax collection in El Salvador leading to increased revenue of US$ 350m per year. As sunlight is the best disinfectant to corruption, so transparency is one of the best deterrents. Europe and the US have moved to start requiring mining, oil and gas companies to have to report the taxes they have paid in every country they are present in. Europe has also moved to require banks to report profits, taxes paid, turnover and number of employees broken down on a country-by-country basis, laying bare attempts to shift profits into tax havens. In contrast, Australia\u2019s pathetic response in this area has been to legislate so the ATO could publicly report total income, taxable income and income tax payable in Australia for corporate tax entities with total incomes of $100m or more. This will do little to expose any profit shifting activities by multinational companies. To be fair to the government, even this weak measure met with fierce opposition from much of the corporate sector and their tax minimisation advisers. The Coalition voted against the measure in the parliament. In addition to greater transparency, the real test will be if governments can agree to reform the out-dated global tax framework. Multinational corporations need to be taxed on the basis of where they are actually doing business, as opposed to being taxed on the basis of their legal structures which can be artificially manipulated to avoid paying tax anywhere on parts of their profits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
