Oaxaca", "bodyText": "Why : Oaxaca is a strange mixture of the modern and ancient with lots of local colour and interesting historical ruins. It's a quirky town with some strange festivals, such as the Night of the Radishes, which is a radish-sculpting contest held every December 23. It's also the capital of mezcal, and I used to go to Caf\u00e9 Hipotesis, a drinking den dedicated to mezcal and tequila, which is also lined with philosophy books. They have a drink called tequila pensamiento which translates as \"thoughtful tequila\", which I found amusing, as tequila doesn't exactly encourage thoughtfulness. What's the best thing : It's an intensely colourful place, as the influence of the original inhabitants is still very much alive compared with other parts of Mexico. Craft traditions in the area are thriving and the two indigenous groups, the Zapotec and the Mixtec, sell works made from papier mch\u00e9, beaten metal and wood in the local markets. My perfect day: Eating local handmade mango ice cream in the zocalo - the central plaza - and going to Caf\u00e9 Hipotesis to sample all the different types of mezcal. I would also fit in a visit to the Graphic Arts Institute, which has an incredible collection of folk art. Advice: Visit the astoundingly beautiful beaches on the western side of the state, particularly those at Puerto Angel and Huatulco. It is a five-hour journey on winding, twisting roads, but it's worth it. How do I get there?
