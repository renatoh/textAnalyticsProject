Or you can select a nearby theatre and see what's on and when, or browse a list of current titles and forthcoming releases \u2013 along with ratings and reviews. Free Urbanspoon An innovative way to solve the age-old problem of where to eat. Once Urbanspoon has got your location from the phone, just shake it and a slot-machine-style roller picks out a local restaurant that serves your chosen cuisine. If you don't like the sound of it, shake it again. Results are better in cities. Free Skype Skype on a computer allows users to talk, free, to other users anywhere in the world. Callers can also have cut-price conversations with people on landlines or mobiles. The new Skype iPhone app brings all of that to the phone. Free iFooty Get the latest football results, minute-by-minute match reports and news from your club (as long as they're in the top four English leagues or the Scottish Premier). Sadly, the maker has had to remove fixture lists because of copyright problems, but otherwise it includes everything a fan needs. There's a similar app, Cricinfo Mobicast, for cricket fans. Free MMS Photo Messaging Unbelievable as it may sound, the iPhone can't do picture messaging on its own, so the MMS app is vital for anyone who wants to send pictures over MMS (the phone can email pictures fairly easily, though). It's free to install, but users have to buy credits to send their pictures. Apple will add picture messaging support in the next version of the iPhone, due this summer.

It links up to the free Google Reader service (www.google.com/reader) to keep track of updates from any website of your choice.

It even saves the text of the pages, so you can read articles when there's no reception. \u00a32.99 Shazam This music-finding service has been available on all British mobile phones for years \u2013 dial 2580 and hold the phone up to speakers playing music and it will send you a text message (at a cost of 50p) with the artist and title. But the iPhone app is free to download and free to use. Free Ocarina Not all apps are useful or have a particular point. The Ocarina app, for instance, makes the phone act like a cheap musical instrument. Hold it up to your mouth, like a real ocarina, and blow into the microphone and the phone will produce a gentle tone. 59p Crayon Physics Deluxe This groundbreaking game makes great use of the iPhone's touch-screen \u2013 the aim is to move a ball from one side of the screen to the star logo at the other side. But you need to do it by drawing shapes on the screen \u2013 with a finger \u2013 that act as though they are real objects that fall, bounce and move. \u00a32.99 Shakespeare The complete works of Shakespeare on your phone. True, the iPhone's screen isn't well suited to reading a whole play, but this app is handy as a reference tool or if you need to settle an erudite pub argument. It contains all the plays, poems and sonnets. Free \u2022 Anthony Dhanendran is reviews editor of Computeractive magazine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
