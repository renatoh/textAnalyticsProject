The crypt of the listed non-conformist chapel at Arnos Vale still holds the winch that lowered coffins, and the recycled railway tracks that carried them towards the 1928 furnace of one of the earliest crematoriums in Britain, and the first in the West Country. The tracks were discarded when the heat of the furnace buckled them and made them unusable. It also holds a cremulator, a machine for pulverising burned bone into ash, the only one known of its type. Arnos Vale opened in 1839 on 25 acres of a celebrated beauty spot. It was a commercial venture by a group of Bristol investors because the city's medieval cemeteries were bursting, swelled by thousands who died in a cholera epidemic. The last time open days were held at the cemetery was in 1929, when they invited in apprehensive local people to see the facilities for themselves. What they saw was state-of-the-art for its day. When the clergyman taking the funeral pressed a switch, an electric bulb lit down below, prompting the staff \u2013 on orders to maintain strict silence as they worked \u2013 to turn the winch and lower the coffin. Legend has it that the furnace was tested by cremating a sheep: it proved so successful that soon two more were installed. By the late 1980s, much of the cemetery was derelict, and in 1998, when it lost its cremation license and so had no income at all, the private owner simply locked the gates and left. Volunteers opened it again and began clearing paths and leading tours through the monuments to local worthies, including the heroic Joseph Williams, a young surgeon who insisted on helping day and night in a local workhouse during a 1849 cholera epidemic, and died of the disease himself. It is now owned by the council, and has been restored through a Heritage lottery grant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
