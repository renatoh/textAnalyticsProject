With just three days to go until the end of the tax year, fund managers, fund supermarkets and discount brokers have been flooded with applications from investors determined to use their Isa allowance. Many report strong sales for foreign and emerging markets funds. Fidelity International, whose Isa sales are up by 108 per cent on 2005, said its biggest-selling fund was the recently launched Fidelity Global Property, followed by Fidelity India Focus. China Focus was the fourth best seller. Mark Dampier of independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown - one of the biggest ISA brokers in the country - has also noticed a big interest in emerging markets funds. Its top sellers include Neptune Russian, Fidelity India Focus and Gartmore China Opportunities. Dampier said the firm's Isa sales were up 80 per cent year on year in February. 'And we're up 100 per cent in March compared with February,' he said. Fund supermarket Interactive Investor said it had seen an 84 per cent increase in Isa sales, with its best sellers including Jupiter Emerging European Opportunities, CS European Frontiers, JPM Emerging Markets and Threadneedle Latin America. However, figures released last week by the Investment Management Association showed UK All Companies as the most popular Isa sector in February, accounting for 25 per cent of sales. The IMA reported Isa sales of \u00a3131m in February (net of redemptions), up 53 per cent on sales in the same month last year. Invesco Perpetual, which is in its closed period and therefore not allowed to comment on sales, is believed to have done particularly well. Isa sales are believed to have doubled year on year, and its Income and High Income funds, both managed by Neil Woodford, are rumoured to be taking \u00a36m a day. This is borne out by discount broker Torquil Clark, whose top sellers are Invesco Perpetual's Income and High Income funds, Jupiter Merlin Growth Portfolio and New Star UK Special Situations. Jupiter said its Isa sales were up 70 per cent for the three months to the end of March compared with the same period last year, and up 92 per cent in March itself. Alicia Wylie, spokeswoman for the firm, said the Jupiter Merlin fund of funds has done particularly well: 'People have now really accepted the concept of funds of funds. We are seeing very strong sales there.' The surge in sales follows three years of strong stock market performance, lending weight to the belief that investors only start investing when a market run is approaching its end. Dampier says: 'Three years ago we couldn't sell a sausage.' Investors' new-found enthusiasm for the stock market is not limited to Isas - Hargreaves Lansdown is selling 300 self-invested personal pensions a day. The increase in equity Isa sales does not seem to be at the expense of cash mini-Isas. Many banks and building societies, including the Alliance &amp; Leicester and Nationwide, are reporting that cash Isa sales are running ahead of last year's figures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
