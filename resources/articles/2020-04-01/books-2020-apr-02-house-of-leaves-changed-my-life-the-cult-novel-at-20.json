The novel quickly gained a cult following, and was praised for its experiments with typography, labyrinthine design and strange story centred on one man\u2019s discovery that his new family home is larger on the inside than the outside, by one inch. When a mysterious doorway appears, leading to a maze of smooth, ash-grey walls, Will Navidson \u2013 the house\u2019s owner, a Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist \u2013 goes in to investigate. The Navidson Record, his film of these explorations, becomes the intense focus of a blind man called Zampan\u00f2, who writes about the footage with lengthy, academic precision. When Zampan\u00f2 is found dead in his apartment, troubled tattoo artist Johnny Truant discovers his notes and inherits the fixation. As Truant becomes increasingly obsessed with the story, so too does the reader. Two decades on, Danielewski sees his relationship with his first book as that of a slightly distant parent. \u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he says, \u201cHouse of Leaves is a kid. I\u2019m that kid\u2019s dad. By now my kid has made a lot of friends, forged close ties, has a multitude of personal relationships I know nothing about. Now and then, my kid\u2019s friends think it\u2019s cool to meet the dad, but they don\u2019t want the dad hanging around for too long, they\u2019re not friends with the dad, they\u2019re friends with my kid.\u201d Dreebs Thornhill is a moderator of the House of Leaves book club, a Facebook group with more than 7,000 members and counting. She agrees with Danielewski\u2019s personification. \u201cHouse of Leaves is a living, breathing thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you can\u2019t relax with until you\u2019ve discussed it with someone else.\u201d The thousands of readers in the group have bonded over the mysteries in the book; and new readers continue to join, often in search of guidance. \u201cIt\u2019s become a tight family that are dedicated to each other,\u201d Thornhill says. \u201cA lot of them saw the group as a window in a dark room. House of Leaves doesn\u2019t just connect with people, but actually connects people. The impact has been greatly meaningful.\u201d Benjamin Muir, a doctoral candidate at Western Sydney University can attest to this impact. He says the book irrevocably changed the course of his life. He was particularly struck by how it dealt with loss \u2013 a topic he explores in his thesis: \u201cWe all Create Stories to Protect Ourselves\u201d: Trauma, Grief and Letting go in Mark Z Danielewski\u2019s House of Leaves. \u201cI\u2019ve felt a lot of the critical work on [the book] has been a little blinkered, or perhaps myopic in its focus on the typographical experiments and oddities rather than the themes,\u201d he says. \u201cTrauma and grief are two of the foremost themes.\u201d Before House of Leaves, Muir was \u2013 in his own words \u2013 flunking his first year at university, smoking too much weed and dealing with personal trauma that he couldn\u2019t process. \u201cHouse of Leaves changed everything. It taught me what it meant to let go,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned the book had originally grown from a piece of writing Mark undertook while dealing with his father being on his deathbed. I began to understand it a lot better and see how the act of writing the book is almost like a kind of pay-it-forward to the reader, to be able to overcome that grief.\u201d Anecdotally, young men hold a particular reverence for the novel \u2013 perhaps for this reason. \u201cI think Danielewski wrote this for everyone, but I think a lot of men who weren\u2019t necessarily raised with the same toolset with regards to emotional intelligence many women have should be able to find something valuable there, in terms of dealing with their grief and trauma,\u201d says Muir. In part, House of Leaves is also about obsession, a trait it demands from its readers; to simply finish the book, with its deliberately complex structure, is an act of dedication \u2013 for some more than others. \u201cI would describe [myself as] totally blind,\u201d says Timothy Peters, a fan of the book who has a genetic eye condition called Leber congenital amaurosis. Due to its structure, House of Leaves doesn\u2019t work well as an audiobook, but Peters listened to a bootleg version on YouTube before he discovered a braille copy around 1,400 pages long. \u201cWhen I like something, I get a tiny bit obsessed,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the concept of mazes and labyrinths is thematically important to me as a blind individual who has once or twice got lost in my own neighbourhood.\u201d Peters had no idea there was a blind character in House of Leaves before he started it, and says the book\u2019s use of sound, rather than visual descriptions, made it a unique reading experience for him. \u201cWe always read about visual descriptions of characters, places and objects, but what literature does not understand is, though sight is an important sense, it is one of five,\u201d he says. Over the last 20 years, House of Leaves has continued to reward readers prepared to navigate its labyrinth, with a community of fans ready to support them if they ever get lost in the dark. Even Danielewski has re-entered the maze recently, reading his debut cover to cover. \u201cI was proud, humbled, astonished, unsettled,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end, I sobbed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
