My body starts to buck, breath unable to leave my lungs. It feels as if I\u2019m going into cardiac arrest. I suspect that this one-to-one session with Tony Riddle, ultra-athlete and natural lifestyle coach, will be my ruin. When he greets me, too early in the morning, he is disconcertingly hale, with the focused gaze of a Viking approaching shore. Worse, he is wearing a pair of those amphibious foot-gloves. You know, the ones with individual toe sheaths that make you think a gorilla is walking towards you on its hands. \u201cInside every human is an endurance athlete,\u201d is one of his remarks on meeting, which is a) too inspiring for a Tuesday morning, and b) not true. Beneath my feckless exterior is an even lazier core slob, only kept at bay with strategic food bribes and inconvenient council tax demands. Riddle\u2019s \u201crewilding\u201d philosophy is about reconnecting humans to natural behaviours \u2013 particularly ways of moving that modern lifestyles have estranged us from. We were not designed to sit for 10 hours a day, he explains. Electric lighting confuses our sleep cycles. Urban architecture encourages bad posture. The artificial repetitions of the gym encourage strain and uneven musculature. He winces when he sees my trainers, which is rich. Why are most shoes narrower at the front than the heel? he asks. A foot\u2019s natural shape is the opposite \u2013 toes are meant to spread, and grip the ground: we have more than 100 muscles down there. Thick-soled, cushioned running shoes cause these to atrophy, and deprive us of sensory feetback. I mean back feet. I mean feedback. Sorry, I\u2019ve been sitting for a while. I thought the session might involve gently foraging for nuts; actually, Riddle\u2019s thesis is that naturally developed bodies have incredible abilities. There\u2019s much focus on feet \u2013 \u201cthe basis of your superstructure\u201d. I stand on one leg, flailing, confirming my body has less balance than my bank account. Yet I find revelations, too. We practice the Wim Hof breathing technique, and I\u2019m astonished to learn I can hold my breath \u2013 after exhaling \u2013 for a full minute. Next, we move to straight-arm pullups, and I\u2019m a little confused by these attempts to raise my body toward a metal bar, without bending at the elbow. Surely an anatomical impossibility, at best a physical riddle? Oh, my God, I think, arms shaking, his name is Toe Knee Riddle? Like a superhero alias. A few weeks ago, Riddle ran the length of the country barefoot, to raise money for charity, despite being born with underdeveloped lower limbs and spending years in braces. Needless to say, he pulls himself toward the bar using just his back muscles, until he is almost horizontal. There are also simpler ideas for living naturally in the modern world: squatting at your office desk; \u201csurfing\u201d inside train carriages, which involves avoiding handrails and using micro-adjustments of your feet to balance; removing chairs from your home. But the extreme ideas are fascinating. \u201cCold immersion is so under-rated,\u201d Riddle announces. I, however, don\u2019t think it\u2019s under-rated enough. He believes ice baths have benefits for cellular response, digestion and the immune system. I believe it will make my organs shut down. The disagreement is academic \u2013 I check my bag, realise I\u2019ve forgotten my swimming trunks. Riddle looks at me in a way that seems to say: \u201cThat was a subconscious choice, to avoid the ice bath.\u201d He has a spare pair, he laughs, slapping me on the back. And this is how I found myself climbing into a freezer of water, worrying about having a heart attack. \u201cBreathe,\u201d Riddle compels me. Exhaling will calm my nervous system, he says. And it does. I stop shivering. I spend two minutes submerged in the ice, surprisingly calm. My body adapts, capable of more than I thought. When I step out, I feel superhuman. You know what? I do recommend this. Rewilding chimes with me. It\u2019s not macho and it emphasises play. I would sooner climb a tree than up my reps in the gym. I like running the low walls in my neighbourhood, and prefer a dance around the kitchen to any fitness fad. A morning of getting back to nature has left me feeling vital and empowered. I wonder what six months of this could do. From sub-zero to hero? When I agreed to go rewilding, I thought we would be releasing wolves in Leeds city centre. I\u2019d definitely pack my trunks for that. Wellness or hellness? Wildness. I won\u2019t wear the glove shoe, though. 5/5 One-to-one Rewilding sessions with Tony Riddle start from \u00a3120, and there are workshops available from 14 December for \u00a360."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
