America woke up to a tense political landscape where each candidate still has a path to electoral victory but with Joe Biden narrowly ahead and key states in the midwest down to the wire as postal votes were still being counted. Trump, addressing a crowd of supporters packed into a room at the White House in the early hours, despite the pandemic, claimed victory in states that remain too close to call and peddled baseless claims of \u201cfraud\u201d. The president also threatened to challenge the election results in the supreme court, even as his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, won the state of Arizona \u2013 a remarkable upset for Republicans in a state known as the birthplace of Trumpism. Trump\u2019s victories in Florida, Ohio and Texas have kept his hopes of re-election alive, but the pivotal swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Early on Wednesday morning, Wisconsin was looking vital for Biden as the last votes were being counted and it was nearing a result. Addressing supporters earlier in the evening, Biden said: \u201cI believe we\u2019re on track to win this election.\u201d The US on Wednesday was bracing for a long and agonising fight for the White House . Democratic hopes of an early landslide for Biden over Trump on election night were dashed as the president won Florida, one of the biggest prizes of the night, raising the spectre of legal challenges and civil unrest. As of 9am ET on Wednesday morning, Biden had won 238 electoral college votes, and Trump had taken 213. A winner would need 270 electoral college votes to clinch the White House. Trump spoke in the east room of the White House with numerous US flags behind him and flanked by two TV screens, which had been showing Fox News. About 150 guests were standing with few face masks and little physical distancing. Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and other family members took front-row seats. \u201cI want to thank the American people for their tremendous support,\u201d the president said, accompanied on stage by his wife Melania, and Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. \u201cMillions and millions of people voted for us tonight and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we won\u2019t stand for it. We will not stand for it.\u201d Guests cheered and whooped in response. There is no evidence for Trump\u2019s allegation of disenfranchisement. He added, baselessly: \u201cThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. So our goal now is to ensure the integrity \u2013 for the good of this nation, this is a very big moment \u2013 this is a major fraud on our nation.\u201d The staggering remarks confirmed the worst fears of activists and analysts who predicted that Trump would use spurious arguments to stop legitimate mail-in votes from being counted. In contrast, Biden struck a cautiously optimistic tone and warned that it was not over until every ballot is counted. \u201cWe feel good about where we are,\u201d Biden told supporters tooting car horns in Wilmington, Delaware, early on Wednesday. \u201cWe really do. I\u2019m here to tell you tonight we believe we\u2019re on track to win this election. \u201cWe knew because of the unprecedented early vote, the mail-in vote, that it\u2019s going to take a while, we\u2019re going to have to be patient until the hard work of counting votes is finished. And it ain\u2019t over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.\u201d The former vice-president added pointedly: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place or Donald Trump\u2019s place to declare who\u2019s won this election. That\u2019s the decision of the American people but I\u2019m optimist about this outcome.\u201d But even as Biden spoke, Trump made a baseless allegation that appeared to preview a bitter fight ahead. He tweeted from the White House: \u201cWe are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed.\u201d Twitter flagged the tweet as disputed or possibly misleading. The tightening of the race heightened fears of prolonged and perilous limbo, increasing the risk of street protests and violence. Both sides have hired battalions of lawyers for a post-election fight. The tallies came on a night by turns both inspiring and unnerving, with tens of millions of Americans queueing up to express their voices as a nation facing multiple crises found itself at a crossroads. From New York to Phoenix, from Detroit to Los Angeles, and even as coronavirus cases surged in swing states, tens of millions of people waited patiently to determine whether Trump will serve a second term or make way for Biden, a former vice-president. A record of more than 100 million people had voted early due to the surging pandemic, with Democrats thought to have the edge, so Trump, a Republican, was relying on what he called a \u201cred wave\u201d on election day itself. Experts predicted the final total could be around 160 million, a turnout rate of more than two-thirds of the eligible voting population \u2013 the highest in more than a century. Both candidates signaled confidence before polls closed on Tuesday night. Trump, the first impeached president to run for re-election, expressed faith that the size of his campaign rallies would prove a more reliable measure of support than conventional national polling, which has consistently shown Biden leading. Biden, who at 77 would be the oldest US president ever elected if he wins, visited his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He wrote in ink on the living room wall: \u201cFrom this house to the White House with the Grace of God. Joe Biden 11.3.2020.\u201d He then made a last-ditch appeal to voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, addressing an impromptu street gathering in Philadelphia. \u201cTrump\u2019s got a lot of things backwards,\u201d he said through a face mask. \u201cIf you elect me, I\u2019m going to be an American president.\u201d Concerns about voter suppression and voter intimidation hung over the election but, as the day went on, election observers said it went relatively smoothly. This may have been a result of increased awareness about the issues in addition to so many people having cast their ballots early, easing pressure on election officials. Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs an election protection hotline, said: \u201cWe are not seeing major systemic barriers that are obstructing voters\u2019 ability to participate in the process en masse.\u201d Even so, a federal judge also ordered the postal service to conduct a last-minute sweep of its facilities to search for nearly 300,000 ballots unaccounted for. The agency said in a late afternoon court filing it was unable to complete the sweep by the deadline without disrupting its election day schedule. There were also reports of misinformation. Voters in Flint, Michigan, received a robocall telling them to vote on Wednesday because of long lines, Dana Nessel, the state\u2019s attorney general, said. New York\u2019s attorney general said she was investigating reports 10 million people received a robocall telling them to \u201cstay safe and stay home\u201d. The election is widely seen as a hinge moment that will decide whether Trump was an aberration or a direction. After four years of domestic and international turmoil, Democrats are hoping to seize their chance to halt his populist-nationalist \u201cMake America great again\u201d movement in its tracks. Trump was hoping for a replay of 2016 when, as a businessman and reality TV star with no prior political experience, he beat Hillary Clinton in a seismic repudiation of the Washington establishment and its consensus on issues long assumed settled. Patience was the watchword, however. TV networks promised to exercise extreme caution to avoid calling results prematurely, mindful of the confusion that set in during the disputed 2000 election between George W Bush and Al Gore. Early voting includes 64m mail-in ballots, meaning that the count could take hours, days or even weeks before producing a definitive winner. Fearful of potential convulsions, shops were boarded up in cities including Washington, New York and Raleigh, North Carolina. Concrete barriers and a \u201cnon-scalable fence\u201d were erected outside the White House, where Trump was due to host an election night party for hundreds of people \u2013 yet another potential Covid-19 threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
