Now 44 years after they first played Wembley, Frey\u2019s co-anchor Don Henley (lean, intense, could be played by Bryan Cranston in the biopic) acknowledges the group\u2019s Jurassic status, but adds that \u201cdinosaurs leave big footprints\u201d. And it\u2019s true: the Eagles brought professionalism and a certain Hollywood gloss to raggedy country-rock, and were rewarded with genuinely phenomenal commercial success. And it\u2019s to \u201ccarry on Glenn\u2019s legacy\u201d that Henley persists, aided by longtime bandmates Joe Walsh and Timothy B Schmit, with country legend Vince Gill and Frey\u2019s son Deacon singing Glenn\u2019s songs. If the show betrays the static slickness typical of such legacy groups, there are moments, like on Take It to the Limit, when the Eagles\u2019 trademark multi-part harmonies sound ageless and heavenly. Meanwhile, the yearning, lachrymose storytelling of Frey\u2019s Lyin\u2019 Eyes strikes a winning balance with the glamorous ennui of Henley\u2019s more cynical songs, such as One of These Nights. A traffic jam of soft-rockers stuck in the same gear yield a saggy mid-set malaise, the group\u2019s trademark polish smothering less inspired material. But Walsh, the group\u2019s resident gurning rock\u2019n\u2019roll maverick, kickstarts a late-set rally with his own raucous Walk Away and the acid-rock wig-out of Funk #49 (by his 60s power-trio James Gang), before Henley answers with his post-Eagles solo hit The Boys of Summer; perhaps his best song, its air of disillusionment and betrayal has grown only more resonant with the years. The paranoid, cocaine-cowboy vibe of Life in the Fast Lane, meanwhile, conjures an edge the show often lacks. Hotel California arrives in the encore, of course, by now the Eagles\u2019 own Stairway to Heaven: overplayed, overfamiliar, ultimately underwhelming and packing a similarly iconic guitar solo which, once Steuart Smith begins it, feels like it\u2019s never going to end. And you sense that Henley \u2013 the dinosaur who refuses to even consider extinction, still selling out stadiums \u2013 would be fine with that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
