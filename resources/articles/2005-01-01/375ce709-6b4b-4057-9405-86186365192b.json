Never the golden boy, like Ra\u00fal, Morientes was all the same adored because Real Madrid's demanding fans saw in him a player with all the old-fashioned values which were, once, the staple diet at Liverpool FC itself. If Ra\u00fal was the soft-top sports model for showing off to the neighbours at the weekends, Morientes was the reliable people-carrier which was also more comfortable to drive. It is not only at the Bernab\u00e9u that Morientes' unstinting work-rate, 24-carat goal record and basic professionalism has won him appreciation. Milan Baros may have been only 16 when Morientes, now 28, moved to Madrid and Liverpool's Czech striker could have felt threatened by the arrival of a triple Champions League winner in a team run by a coach who is comfortable with the idea of using only one striker. But Baros is also shrewd enough to know a good thing when he sees it. \"Personally I'm delighted Fernando is joining Liverpool because I know he is an outstanding footballer,\" Baros said yesterday. \"His deal is very positive news for Liverpool in general but also important in its timing because Djibril Ciss\u00e9's injury is obviously long-term and I have had my own fitness difficulties recently. But, above all, I'm really looking forward to establishing our partnership on the pitch. \"He is extremely good in the air, just like my international team-mate Jan Koller, and Jan and I have proved a successful double act. Fernando is a fine goalscorer in his own right, as he proved so clearly with Monaco last season. \"But I'm hopeful he and I will join up to the same kind of effect as Koller and I for the Czech Republic. The thing I'm sure of is that Fernando will help us climb to a higher position in the Premiership.\" All Baros's points are sound. Although Morientes scored 19 domestic and European goals for Monaco en route to a Champions League runners-up medal and the award of Most Valuable Striker, his last prolific season at Madrid was 2001-02, thanks to Real's president Florentino P\u00e9rez. Then he scored 21 domestic and European goals, 12 with his feet and nine with his head. But he also provided a phenomenal 18 assists to claim a share of 39 goals in a season when Madrid won their last Champions League. P\u00e9rez's obsession with the latest model in his summer star-buying sprees has cost Morientes dearly. The unfairness of instantly being relegated when Ronaldo arrived after winning the World Cup in 2002 was compounded by the then Real technical director Jorge Valdano hawking Morientes around to Internazionale and Barcelona without his permission. The situation got so out of hand that in the 2002 European Super Cup against Feyenoord, Vicente del Bosque was ordered to omit Morientes from the squad. Ra\u00fal wore his friend's No9 jersey in his own as a gesture of support, and the two players, plus Fernando Hierro, argued openly and bitterly with P\u00e9rez and Valdano in the lobby of their Monte Carlo hotel late that night. Perhaps the decline in Real's heart and soul can be traced to that night and the cavalier way in which a talented, loyal servant was treated. Morientes hurts defences and works for the team, for his coach, for his partner - all the while scoring his own share. Perhaps that explains a remarkable scene in September 2002. Morientes was finished, as far as P\u00e9rez was concerned. So, while the striker warmed the bench against Espanyol, the entire Bernab\u00e9u continually chanted his name. The late goal Steve McManaman scored to seal a 2-0 win almost passed unremarked as wave after wave of \"cari\u00f1o\" washed down from the Madrid faithful.
