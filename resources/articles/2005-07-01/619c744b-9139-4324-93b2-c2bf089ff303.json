Residents have long been divided on the merits of having George Bush and other world leaders drop in, but yesterday the town's last vestiges of Perthshire normality disappeared. As London police horses walked the streets and American Chinook helicopters clattered overhead, there was a traffic jam of CCTV vans in the town and a bomb scare in the Bank of Scotland branch on the high street which forced the evacuation of the town centre for several hours. For Allan Devlin, proprietor of Sugar and Spice, Auchterarder's celebrated pie shop, the G8 is now getting far too exciting. \"That's the limit. We were doing OK in the bakery until this bomb scare. I had some special G8 pies in the oven. Then we were told to get out. I had to leave the oven doors open.\" Many of Auchterarder's shops have been boarded up. The bomb scare and incidents in Edinburgh 50 miles away on Monday have made Jane, who has a gift shop in the high street, glad she put up the plywood. \"Its an inconvenience but I'm now glad I did it,\" she said. It has taken 18 months of planning and \u00a3100m of public money to set up the seven-day security operation. The most visible sign is the six-feet-high, 5.5-mile-long double steel fence that snakes around the perimeter of the Gleneagles resort. Yesterday, groups of officers were stationed along it every few hundred yards and others were searching thick shrubbery on the nearby A9. Almost 11,000 police have been deployed, up to half from England, and 3,000-4,000 will be on duty in the Auchterarder area today. A five-mile air exclusion zone has been in force since Monday and the police have access to more than 200 dogs, 60 horses and 2,500 vehicles, including quad bikes, coaches and bicycles. A heat-seeking inflatable has been tethered to the Gleneagles golf course to detect intruders Tayside police have said the army would play no part in the policing operation beyond giving \"specialised search support\". There is no intention, either, officers say, to involve the personal protection squads for the G8 leaders, or to use CS gas, water cannon or tasers. Baton rounds will be carried only by dedicated firearms officers and then used only for VIP protection or in \"one on one\" situations. A police spokeswoman said they would never be used in public order situations. Yesterday there was barely room in the town or its environs to station the police, who have been called in from 12 British forces. Every road junction, bridge, intersection, layby, verge and pathway in and around Auchterarder had at least one vanload of police or a pair of motorbikes police on it. \"None of us has seen anything like this before,\" said a constable from Derby, who was guarding the crossroads of Tullibardine and Easthill roads in Auchterarder where only police vehicles had passed all day. \"I'll be glad if there's no trouble and I can just go home to my family.\" But the saturation policing has not gone down well with all Auchterarder residents or protesters. \"There's far too many bloody police,\" said Allan, a retired builder out in the small park where today's anti-G8 march will start and finish. \"There's enough for one person each, yet you'll never find one when you want them usually\". \"You would think that the whole of al-Qaida was coming,\" said his friend James. \"I'm dreading proper violence - I saw what happened in Genoa,\" said local resident Cara Williams. \"My children are in Perth staying with relatives and I'm not bringing them back until this is all over. The police have been brilliant. If they hadn't been here we would be really scared. We don't have a choice to be here. We have to work.\" \"This is a display of power, completely disproportionate to the the threat posed,\" said Henri, a French protester, in Stirling. \"Why do the British want to make it seem that anyone who goes on this legitimate march is a terrorist? Yet everyone knows that the world's greatest terrorist is George Bush.\" Other G8 objectors were angry after being told that only 5,000 people would be allowed into Auchterarder to march from the park towards the security fence. According to the police in Edinburgh, it will be impossible to handle more than that number and anyone else will be turned back. \"The police are clearly trying to deter people marching. It's all hype to put people off coming,\" said Gill Hubbard, one of the march organisers and a spokeswoman for G8 Alternatives. \"It's outrageous if any limit is put on how many people can march,\" said David Miller of Spinwatch.com and a sociology lecturer at Strathclyde University. \"This is becoming a protest against the G8 by consent. It becomes only a token protest that the police condone.\" In fact, people on today's march will not get even a glimpse of the hotel where the G8 leaders will meet. The route takes them two miles past some of Auchterarder's most expensive houses and briefly up to the fence, where they have been told they will be in earshot of the world leaders. John Vine, chief constable of Tayside police, insists his officers would police the summit in a proportionate way. \"[But] if we encounter people who are prepared to use violence to achieve their aims, who are going to break the law, then we will take robust action. We will arrest them and put [them] before the courts. \"It's probably more difficult for a small number of agitators to make an impact in a field than it is in Princes Street. At the same time, we have always known that a place like Gleneagles ... would be difficult and challenging.\" One Auchterarder woman, who did not want to give her name but said she had been buying in stocks of food in case the shops remained closed, said: \"I work at Gleneagles hotel and I must say that I will be very glad when this is all over.\" Who will attend The inner circle Tony Blair, US president George Bush, French president Jacques Chirac; German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Italian president Silvio Berlusconi, Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, Canadian prime minister Paul Martin and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
