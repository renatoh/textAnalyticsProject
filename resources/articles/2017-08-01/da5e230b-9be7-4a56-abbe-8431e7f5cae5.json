United lost Tuesday\u2019s Uefa Super Cup 2-1 to Real Madrid, who have won the European Cup for the past two seasons, the first club to do so in the Champions League era. United will enter at the group stage of the tournament when it starts next month. When on the summer tour of the US Mourinho was clear his side were not in the class of Real and Barcelona, after losing to the latter and managing only a penalty shootout win against the former in friendly matches. United won last season\u2019s Europa League but Mourinho admits it is a challenge to try to catch Real, Bar\u00e7a and other continental heavyweights. He said: \u201cManchester United are one of the top three football clubs in the world, no doubt about it, but the football club is one thing and the team\u2019s credentials going into a competition are another thing entirely. We have a giant on our chest, which is really heavy, but we don\u2019t compare our potential to the biggest clubs in Europe right now. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it step by step and be humble. The first step is to try to finish in the top three. If we manage that, we\u2019ll try to finish in the top two. Then, when you\u2019re in the Champions League last 16 draw, anything can happen.\u201d Despite Forbes naming United in June as the world\u2019s richest club, worth $3.69bn (\u00a32.79bn), Mourinho claimed other teams have the finance to compete, again making his task harder. \u201cBecause Manchester United is a real giant, it doesn\u2019t matter if the club is somewhat far away from that level for three, four, five or 10 years. It doesn\u2019t matter: the club will always be a giant. But our job is to try to bring the football club back to that stature. That\u2019s really difficult these days,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, the giants were the powerful ones economically, and now there are small clubs in terms of prestige and history, who are giants economically. That changes absolutely everything. I want the team to be on a par with the club\u2019s history, which is something I\u2019ve been lucky enough to feel at every club \u2013 there was the same kind of feeling at Inter and at Real Madrid. \u201cWe are going to do that, step by step. Last season we won trophies. Playing against the European champions [on Tuesday], it\u2019s like we\u2019re back at the theatre, back at that level. This is where we want to be. We\u2019ll improve the team and try to be at that level, to constantly be improving. And I think we\u2019re going to reach that level as a football team in the next couple of years.\u201d Mourinho also stated contentment with Paul Pogba. \u201cI\u2019m more than happy [with him] I\u2019m really happy. He was amazing in the [Europa League] final,\u201d said the manager, the Frenchman having scored the opener in the 2-0 win over Ajax. \u201cI\u2019m totally convinced this season will be even better for him, and that playing in the Champions League against the best teams and players will take some pressure off him, because in the Europa League, he was obviously one of the two or three biggest stars.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
