The draw dented the Hoops' Scottish Premier League title hopes. Tannadice striker David Goodwillie missed an early one-on-one with the Hoops keeper, Fraser Forster, before Gary Hooper drove his 11th goal of the season past Dusan Pernis in the 23rd minute. In a 71st minute United breakaway, Goodwillie was bundled to the ground at the edge of the box by Daniel Majstorovic after the striker had tried to control a Morgaro Gomis pass, but referee Mike Tumilty ruled that there had been no infringement. Garry Kenneth missed the target twice with close-range headers, as United pushed for the equaliser, before the Arabs' midfielder Prince Buaben cleared a Joe Ledley shot off the line. However, Dillon dramatically headed in a Barry Douglas free-kick from close range to give United a deserved 1-1 draw. Rudi Skacel and David Templeton both scored wonder goals, as Hearts continued their excellent form in the SPL with a 2-0 win at home to Hamilton. Skacel opened the scoring on 32 minutes by sending an effort from outside the box on the left wing screaming into the opposite corner of the basement side's net. Templeton added the second in similar style seven minutes after the restart, scoring with an equally impressive strike which went in close to the left-hand post. Simon Mensing had a late penalty saved by home goalkeeper Marian Kello. An Adam Rooney hat-trick gave Inverness Caley a fine 4-2 victory at home to Hibernian. Caley Thistle moved up to fourth in the league table, but were made to work hard for their victory by a spirited 10-man Hibernian. Rooney's second-half hat-trick, taking his tally for the season to 13 in, added to Richie Foran's seventh-minute opener, as Caley Thistle claimed just their second home league win of the campaign. Caley's cause was aided when Paul Hanlon was sent off just five minutes after coming on as a substitute at the start of the second half. Derek Riordan and a Liam Miller penalty threatened to give Hibs a way back into the match, but they were undone by Rooney's clinical finishing, which included a spot-kick. Nick Blackman's brilliant turn and shot earned Motherwell a point at St Mirren Park. Gareth Wardlaw headed St Mirren ahead when he glanced home a Paul McGowan cross in the 37th minute. The Paisley side looked set to frustrate Motherwell until Blackman lashed a strike high into the net with 15 minutes left. Michael Higdon was sent off in the 80th minute after fouling John Sutton but Motherwell could not exploit their advantage. The closest they came was when substitute Ross Forbes fired just wide from 25 yards. St Johnstone ended a run of four league defeats on the bounce to beat Aberdeen 1-0 and pile yet more pressure on the Dons manager, Mark McGhee. The Dons were reduced to 10 men just after the restart when Rory McArdle was shown a straight red for a reckless lunge on winger Cleveland Taylor. The visitors left Pittodrie with all three points when the unfortunate Zander Diamond headed a Peter MacDonald cross into his own net with less than 10 minutes left. Aberdeen are now just a point off the foot of the SPL."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
