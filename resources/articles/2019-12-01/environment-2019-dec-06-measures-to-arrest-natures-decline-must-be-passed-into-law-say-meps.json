Action to halt biodiversity decline is based on voluntary commitments but, less than a year before a crucial UN biodiversity conference in China, MEPs pointed to the destruction of precious ecosystems and the more than 1m species facing extinction as evidence that the approach is failing. The 15th meeting of the conference of the parties (COP15) in Kunming next October offers the next big opportunity to create a decade of new targets to protect the world\u2019s land, oceans and wildlife. These targets will replace 20 biodiversity targets agreed in 2010 in Japan, only one of which is even close to being met. MEPs want the next set of pledges to be underpinned by law so that countries are forced to act \u2013 and they say the EU should lead the way. \u201cIf it\u2019s not legally binding, at the end of the day it\u2019s nice to have but it does not deliver enough to fight what we are facing: not only the climate change crisis, but a huge biodiversity crisis,\u201d said Pascal Canfin, chair of the committee on environment, public health and food safety, which approved the resolution. \u201cWe are living in an ecosystem, and if this ecosystem is vanishing, then we will have to pay to replace these free services and it will be very, very costly,\u201d he said. The draft legislation calls for more sustainable agriculture and forestry to contribute to healthy habitats and ecosystems. MEPs want to make 30% of EU territories places for nature by 2030 and aim to restore 30% of degraded ecosystems. They believe the EU should commit a minimum of 10% of its budget to increase biodiversity. The European parliament will vote on the resolution in January. Anna Heslop, a lawyer for ClientEarth, welcomed the idea of creating legally binding targets. \u201cWe must not reproduce our old mistakes and risk losing another decade of action. 2020 is an absolutely crucial moment for worldwide biodiversity protection,\u201d she said. Sam Chetan-Welsh, a political adviser to Greenpeace UK, said it was \u201creassuring\u201d MEPs recognised the urgent need for legally binding targets and urged the UK government to adopt similar targets after Brexit. He said legally binding commitments on biodiversity should also include protecting at least 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity entered into force in 1993, but decades of international collaboration have failed to save the destruction of the natural world. At least one in ten insects is at risk of extinction, and $577bn (\u00a3440bn) of domestic crops are at risk due to the loss of pollinators, according to the IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity report. The global biomass of wild animals has fallen by 82% since records began and 25% of plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. The IPBES report also found there was a strong link between climate change and loss of biodiversity and one could not be solved without the other. \u201cThe dual emergency of nature decline alongside climate breakdown means transformational action is needed,\u201d said Sandra Bell from Friends of the Earth. \u201cWe seem to have lost sight of the fact that nature provides us with healthy soils, water and air. In the UK, and across the EU, existing targets haven\u2019t worked because they have lacked action, so it\u2019s up to the EU commission and national governments to enforce nature laws.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
