The publication of 10 sets of documentation comes a day earlier than expected, after the Treasury indadvertently emailed the BBC a document discussing concerns over the release of the most sensitive documents and passages. The memo revealed that Treasury officials were worried certain documents suggested Britain may have been spying on the French and that former chancellor Norman Lamont may have been \"undiplomatic\" to his German counterparts. Both John Major and Lord Lamont, prime minister and chancellor at the time, today welcomed the release of papers which the peer said showed the cost of Black Wednesday had been \"dwarfed\" by the gains to the economy. Despite Labour glee that the events of September 16 1992 had been resurrected weeks ahead of a likely general election, the paperwork may put a revisionist slant on the day which saw Britain drop out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and interest rates rocket by 5% in four hours. It now looks as if the day's drama cost the country \u00a33.3bn, according to the final 1997 Treasury analysis, rather than the tens of billions previously estimated. Mr Major said today: \"After the controversies of recent days, and for the avoidance of any doubt, I wish to emphasise that I have made no request whatsoever for any papers to be withheld. \"Any editing has been made by officials to meet the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. \"Indeed, I welcome the release of these papers insofar as they will correct the many misconceptions which surround this particular event, not least the wildly overstated costs of our exit to the taxpayer.\" \"No one denies - least of all myself - that this is a substantial cost but it is also fair to note that it is a fraction of the figures of \u00a327bn, \u00a320bn, \u00a313bn, previously banded about,\" he said. Lord Lamont said: \"The Treasury states the most sensible assumptions give a loss of \u00a33.3bn. This was the cost to the reserves of devaluing sterling. \"Intervention itself is not a cost but the swapping of one currency for another.\" That intervention \"was not discretionary or optional but mandatory under the rules of the ERM\", the peer said. \"This money was not money that could have been used for schools and hospitals,\" he continued. The reserves were restored in a few years to their previous levels.\" Lord Lamont argued that other ERM countries suffered \"very similar\" losses. He said: \"The collapse of the ERM was not just about sterling. \"The costs, though significant, are dwarfed by the gain to the economy of really low inflation.\" The peer added: \"The Labour party is in no position to make political capital out of the ERM, a policy they advocated and supported strongly. One of the papers released states Gordon Brown's opposition to devaluation helped to sustain Britain's membership of the ERM. \"Gordon Brown described the ERM as applying 'socialist planning' to the economy rather than 'relying on market forces'. \"He told the parliamentary Labour party 'We can fight the speculators if we join the ERM'. How much more money has Gordon Brown lost by selling gold from Britain's foreign exchange reserves - an unforced error?\" There has been much debate on how much and what sort of paperwork to release, following an initial request by the Financial Times under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act, which came into force this year. BBC Radio 4's Today programme today revealed it had received an email discussing the most sensitive documents, and suggesting the Treasury may have had early information on a French interest rate rise. The correspondence states: \" It's not clear what the information source for this was - the source could be covert and still in use\", which could give the impression of economic espionage on the UK's part. There are also references to the government's \"hype about economic miracles\", and to the divisions inside the cabinet. It says \"the open warfare between the chancellor and the prime minister made it especially difficult for the markets to decide what the effective objectives of the government were.\" The Treasury later put out a statement on the leaked memo saying it would be \"wholly wrong to draw conclusions about the content of the Black Wednesday papers on the basis of this misleading and outdated leak\". But the shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, reacted angrily this morning at the perception that damaging information about the past Tory record would be released, while his own requests for information about Gordon Brown's economic models had been turned down. He said: \"This is supposed to be a Freedom of Information Act not a Freedom of Propaganda Act.\" Mr Letwin said all but one of his 13 applications had been turned down, including one on development of policy on the euro. He said: \"We will have to see what is released, but I fear there appears to be an intention to use the act not to reveal things that could be embarrassing about the present regime and to use it to maximum effect to achieve a propaganda coup.\" The BBC leak specifically cautions against realeasing some Treasury models and forecasts in case it sets a precedent for Mr Letwin's present day requests. Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, this lunchtime defended the exemptions to the Freedom of Information laws. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"Facts and figures are one thing. Discussions about policy are another. \"I have no idea what particular documents have been disclosed by the Treasury but if everybody agrees that there needs to be space in which policy is formulated, people express views and express judgments, that needs to be done confidentially. \"There also needs to be a period after the decision is made where that is kept confidential because otherwise, for example in relation to collective responsibility, you could see how different people lined up.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
