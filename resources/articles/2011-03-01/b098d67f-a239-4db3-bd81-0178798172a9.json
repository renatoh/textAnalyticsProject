They play old-fashioned instruments ranging from piano, pedal steel and accordions to a funny gadget wound with a handle. They wear checked shirts, sing about the joys of chimney sweeping and hanging out the washing, and bespectacled singer/\"song-crafter\" Colin Meloy looks more like someone auditioning for the role of Clark Kent than a rock star. And yet, this tour seems them playing their biggest ever British venues, while their current album, The King Is Dead, went to No 1 in the US. Partly, their success has been built on years of touring, but The King Is Dead signifies a gear change. Gone are the medieval quirks and 20-minute prog metal operas. In comes American classicism and simply beautiful songs. Meloy has stopped writing short stories and written from the heart. The tour feels like a band savouring their moment. The lightshow is bigger and able to respond to Meloy's request to \"make it blood red\", while the singer is becoming quite the showman. He holds a mandolin above his head, conducts the singalongs and even compares Manchester to \"the land of Oz, or Narnia\", which must be a shock to anyone stumbling in from Oxford Road. However, a two-hour set retains their individuality, with such oldies as The Rake's Song (about burying children) throwing dark into the light. Dividing the crowd into a choir of two halves shouting at each other feels too showbiz until Meloy announces, \"That's what's happening in American politics right now\", and blasts into This Is Why We Fight, a stirring rocker about how power is being taken from the unions. The bizarre, poetry/violin-enhanced Mariner's Revenge \u2013 which seems to appeal most to that section of their audience who do drunken dances while wearing funny hats \u2013 finds Meloy making what must be one of the most bizarre requests ever delivered from a British stage. \"I want you to make the sound of a multitude of people being swallowed by a whale,\" he asks the audience, and amazingly, they do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
