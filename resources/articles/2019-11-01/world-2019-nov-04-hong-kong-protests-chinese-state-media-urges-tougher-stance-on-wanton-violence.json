In an editorial, state-backed China Daily newspaper criticised the \u201cwanton\u201d attacks by \u201cnaive\u201d demonstrators, adding: \u201cThey are doomed to fail simply because their violence will encounter the full weight of the law.\u201d It dismissed the attacks as \u201cnothing more than adolescent hormones pumped up and primed by those willing to exploit them\u201d and accused Hong Kong\u2019s youth of venting anger at \u201cat grievances real and imagined\u201d. \u201cThe radical protesters have been trying hard to convince the world they are championing a noble cause in a peaceful manner rather than engaging in wanton violence.\u201d Police fired tear gas at black-clad protesters on Saturday in some of the worst violence in the Asian financial hub in weeks, with metro stations set ablaze and buildings vandalised, including an outlet of Starbucks. The past five months of anti-government protests in the former British colony represent the biggest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping\u2019s government since he took over China\u2019s leadership in late 2012. Protesters are angry at China\u2019s perceived meddling with Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, including its legal system, since the Asian financial hub returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the accusation. The widely read Global Times tabloid on Sunday condemned the protesters\u2019 actions targeting Xinhua and called for action by Hong Kong\u2019s enforcement agencies. \u201cDue to the symbolic image of Xinhua, the vandalising of its branch is not only a provocation to the rule of law in Hong Kong, but also to the central government and the Chinese mainland, which is the rioters\u2019 main purpose,\u201d it said. On Friday, after a meeting of China\u2019s top leadership, a senior Chinese official said it would not tolerate separatism or threats to national security in Hong Kong and would \u201cperfect\u201d the way it appointed the city\u2019s leader.
