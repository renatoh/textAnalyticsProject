Coming just days after the chancellor, Alistair Darling, warned that the economy is facing its toughest test in more than a decade, the latest GfK/NOP survey, taken between February 8 and 17, showed the consumer confidence index tumbled to -17 from -13 in January and -8 in February last year. The Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter point to 5.25% on February 7 and also reduced rates by a quarter point in early December. Rachael Joy, spokeswoman for GfK/ NOP said: \"This month's drop ... comes in spite of the cut in interest rates earlier this month. Consumers are feeling a little less confident about their own personal finances and much less confident about the general economy as a whole. \"This may have been fuelled by the wide reporting on a housing market slowdown, high fuel and energy prices and rising food prices. These factors all squeeze budgets, causing consumers to be much less confident about making major purchases.\" The survey of 2,000 people is closely watched by analysts in the City for clues about the future path of retail sales, which account for a large chunk of the economy. While official data showed retail sales held up well in January, this week's retail survey from the CBI showed that sales fell this month for the first time since November 2006 in the face of sharp price rises. Most in the City are expecting the economy to grow much more slowly this year than in 2007 as the rate rises of last year, combined with the impact of the credit crunch and big energy prices rises, affect people's willingness to spend. But few expect the Bank's monetary policy committee to cut rates again when it meets next week because several of the MPC's nine members are concerned about inflationary pressures. Today accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward released its regular business trends survey showing inflation expectations at firms had hit their highest level in the 10-year history of the survey. One of the MPC's more hawkish members on interest rates, Tim Besley, said today: \"What is key is that we are going to see a run-up due to food and electricity prices. The Bank is committed, and will remain committed, to bringing inflation back to target over the medium term.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
