The home team spent all last season preparing for their chance to compete against the biggest clubs in the newly professional top tier and it showed here as they attempted to shake the established order. United\u2019s 2-1 Continental League Cup defeat by Arsenal last season had given them a taste of what facing the champions would entail and they had clearly learned the lessons. Only an excellent goal by Caroline Weir was able to break their resolve in their opening fixture against Manchester City and they almost held out against Arsenal. \u201cRelief,\u201d said Joe Montemurro at full time. \u201cA lot of teams are going to find it very difficult here because they are a very good side and we knew it was going to be difficult backing up the Champions League. There was probably a little bit of fatigue in the first half but second half I thought we were brilliant.\u201d In the first half the home team came out looking determined and a raucous crowd, cheering and jeering aplenty, was buoyed by their team pressing the visiting side hard. Arsenal are having their first taste of Champions League football and their leggy start could possibly have been attributed to their 4-0 defeat of Fiorentina on Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s a new experience for us and to be brutally honest we are still getting used to it; it was a long week,\u201d said Montemurro. There was cause for celebration for Arsenal, though, with Jordan Nobbs returning to the starting line up for the first time since rupturing an ACL in November 2018. In the 38th minute the away side found the pass they had been looking for and it characteristically came from Kim Little, who clipped a clever ball to Lisa Evans and the winger swung a cross towards Vivianne Miedema, whose smart header was fantastically saved by Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, at point-blank range. Miedema latched onto the rebound but it was from an acute angle and straight at Earps. In the second half Arsenal moved through the gears but still failed to find the threaded pass they so often rely on to crack teams open. It was the home team that looked to have made the breakthrough when Jane Ross was played through one on one but the Scottish forward hesitated, giving Manuela Zinsberger time to come out and smother the shot. Minutes later Arsenal had their best chance of the half but again Earps was equal to the test. Little weaved her way across the edge of the box, saw a sliver of an opening and struck but Earps pushed the ball away and then threw her body back across goal for the follow-up. With one minute left on the clock the substitute Van de Donk, on for Nobbs, prodded the ball home after Leah Williamson\u2019s shot from distance rebounded off the massed United defenders, a crushingly difficult defeat for a bright home side. The goalscorer said she was \u201cbuzzing\u201d after coming off the bench to steal the win. \u201cYou know what? They [her teammates] did all the work and I took the glory, so it can\u2019t be any better,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be fair I felt like it was coming. We had a lot of chances and I think it came after three shots on goal. Viv hit the post, I was like: \u2018Come on guys, please put it in the goal.\u2019 Happily it fell at my feet and it went in. It was a bit bouncy bouncy bouncy in, so it was a bit lucky as well.\u201d Stoney, though, was philosophical about their two defeats: \u201cI just said to them [the players] that it\u2019s about fine margins, it really is. \u201cAnd that\u2019s actually a really positive place to be, the fact that we\u2019re talking about fine margins and we\u2019re playing Arsenal and Man City, when we\u2019ve effectively been with the new players for seven weeks and we got together 14 months ago. These teams are established.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
