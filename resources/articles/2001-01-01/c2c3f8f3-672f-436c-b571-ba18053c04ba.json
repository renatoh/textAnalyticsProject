They are a dizzy 12th in the table and an improbable victory at Liverpool today could see them climb to eighth. At this point of the season they are normally established in grim, white-knuckled conflict against relegation. It is easy to see why, for some, Glenn Hoddle and not Terry Venables is England's lost manager. His coaching skills, organisational strength and an ability to maximise limited resources mark him out as an outstanding manager. Hoddle has an unfamiliar problem - keeping hold of James Beattie, who is the talk of the Premiership after making it 10 goals in as many matches with his 73rd-minute header from a right-wing cross by Marian Pahars. \"He's not for sale, unless the board tell me different,\" said Hoddle. \"A new stadium is around the corner and although this is a club not enriched with millions there is no reason why we can't keep our major assets. \"James wasn't really at his best today but the great thing about him is that he's such a good listener. I told him at half-time that he wasn't putting daylight between himself and defenders, that his movement was in straight lines. \"We saw the difference in the second half and when the opportunity came he was good enough to take it.\" Until then Derby looked good enough to make it eight clean sheets in 10 matches since Colin Todd moved in to mastermind reorganisation of the defence. \"I thought we were unlucky not to come away with anything,\" Todd said. \"We have no fear these days and we hold our positional play much better.\" The biggest fear on Saturday was that the match would be called off because of the weather. \"It's not sour grapes but we shouldn't be playing Premiership football in these conditions,\" said the Derby manager Jim Smith. \"We tossed up an hour before the game to see who would be playing at the bad end so we could wear the right studs.\" It was a little like a cricket match, with Derby winning the toss and putting Hampshire into bat on a sticky wicket. Derby certainly had the better of the first half, particularly the opening 20 minutes. Hoddle, though, felt it was right to play the game. \"It's ridiculous in a way. We should all have our feet up and be enjoying a mid-season break. Instead, we are preparing for our fourth game in 10 days. But I didn't think the pitch was that bad and we would have been letting the Premiership down if the game was called off.\" Today's match at Anfield holds a special significance for the Southampton goalkeeper Paul Jones, who on his last apparance there two seasons ago was at the wrong end of a 7-1 scoreline. He was blamed for no fewer than four of the goals. \"It was the worst performance of my career,\" he says. \"I have the match on video and I've watched it to learn from my mistakes. But this time I have the confidence of knowing we are going for our third win on the trot, and our third clean sheet.\" Rather like Beattie, Jones has returned from injury and proved to Hoddle that he is one of the most important components in the side. \"It helps when someone is banging them in at the other end and James is certainly doing that. \"He's an upbeat lad who always has a smile. Even when he wasn't scoring he was finishing well on the training pitch, so we knew the goals would come. There is still a lot more of him to come.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
