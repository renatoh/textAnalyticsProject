November 2009 marked one of several low points in the country's recent international history, a 3-0 defeat in Cardiff signalling the end of George Burley's Scotland tenure. Burley's successor, Craig Levein, has presided over clear progress during the intervening months. Scottish fans will use the Carling Nations Cup encounter with Wales as a barometer. \"People will automatically take a photo and compare but that's not uppermost in my mind,\" said Levein. \"I expect us to play well here. I have got a lot of faith in this group of players and their willingness to try hard for each other. Wales were excellent that day. They played with a vibrancy and energy that I think even surprised them.\" Scotland's desire to win the first Carling Nations Cup is demonstrated by a glance at their squad. Whereas other countries have been beset by withdrawals \u2013 and players even declaring an unwillingness to be called up in the first place \u2013 Levein has seen only two of his party pull out. One of them, Craig Mackail-Smith, cannot travel as he will be turning out in the League One play\u2011off final for Peterborough United. \"That shows a willingness from our players to go out and win the tournament,\" said Levein. Scotland had their own challenges in merely getting to Ireland, owing to a combination of ash clouds and severe winds. A contingency plan to travel from Manchester was not required after the Scots' team plane was given special dispensation to fly into Dublin on Tuesday morning. \"Any supporters who even try to make it here have my admiration,\" said Levein. \"They have seen planes cancelled, boats cancelled, so anyone who has even tried will get my thanks.\" Still, an anticipated turn-out of only 5,000 does not augur well for the tournament. Levein reiterated his earlier stance that the entrance of England into a home nations competition would help matters. Such a prospect is on the table for 2013. \"That would be great,\" said Levein. \"The concept [of the Carling Nations Cup] is good but you can't be critical of people for not stumping up money. Especially the way things are [in the economy] over here at the moment.\" Wales hope a return to Dublin prompts a change in fortune. Gary Speed watched his team comprehensively beaten by Ireland here in February, in his first game in charge. Speed has admitted he will take an opportunity to rest several players, though, and Robert Earnshaw is named captain as he wins a 53rd cap. \"My top priority is not only to win the game but to look after the health of the players,\" said Speed. \"The schedule we have been given has made us make those decisions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
