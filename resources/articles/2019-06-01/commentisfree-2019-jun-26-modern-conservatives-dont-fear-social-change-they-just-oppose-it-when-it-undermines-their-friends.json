They act as though renewable energy, battery storage and electric cars will take us down the path to blackouts, economic ruin and, of course, the end of weekends as we know them. But if recent history has taught us anything it\u2019s that there is nothing consistent about the modern conservatives, most of whom live in fear of the unintended consequences of renewable power but warmly welcome the unexpected possibilities of nuclear power. The same contradictions are obvious in agriculture. While spruiking the virtues of genetic modification (GM) and the safety of glyphosate is standard fare for the modern conservatives, not all agricultural innovations are so warmly welcomed. While organic crops offer farmers significantly higher returns, such farming practices are often dismissed as \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d rather than real farming. And when chickenless chicken meat was launched on to the market recently (apparently it tastes a bit like chicken), the National\u2019s deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, responded by tweeting: \u201cNot happy with latest fake food push. Chicken-free chicken is not chicken, it\u2019s reconstituted peas. We need to protect our farmers.\u201d It is not clear whether McKenzie realises that, on the most recent UN data, Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of chickpeas, or if she simply doesn\u2019t care. While the modern conservatives\u2019 love of all things coal seems to revolve around support for traditional coalmining jobs and fears around renewable energy\u2019s reliability, if you scratch the surface another rich vein of hypocrisy can be found. Despite the many column inches they dedicate to the obvious statement that \u201cthe wind doesn\u2019t always blow, and the sun doesn\u2019t always shine\u201d, modern conservatives remain strategically silent about the fact that so-called baseload coal-fired power stations are notoriously unreliable, especially on the hottest days when we need power most. Similarly, while their technophobia is on full display when talking about the dangers of batteries for renewable energy storage or driverless electric cars, perplexingly, the modern conservative seems relaxed and comfortable when it comes to the fact that robot trucks and robot trains are proliferating in the mining industry. If conservatives were really concerned about creating jobs in regional Australia, they would insist that none of the new coalmines they are so keen to subsidise use any robot trucks or trains. But they aren\u2019t, so they won\u2019t. Of course, it\u2019s not just technological change that the modern conservatives seem confused about; the desirability of cultural change really twists them in a knot too. Take \u201ctraditional family values\u201d for example. On the one hand, modern conservatives rage against the \u201cselfishness\u201d of some parents for denying their children access to a traditional mother and father. But at the same time they\u2019ve created an industrial relations system in which parents \u2013 traditional or otherwise \u2013 struggle to spend time with their kids because they need to work split shifts, weekends and other unsociable hours. Parents working in the gig economy don\u2019t get paid holiday leave to spend time with their children. Indeed, our Pentecostal prime minister doesn\u2019t even think work on Sundays should be discouraged with penalty rates. While parliament never sits on a Sunday, it seems our religious representatives still expect a cheap coffee on the Sabbath. And then there is freedom. Modern conservatives in Australia are up in arms about Israel Folau\u2019s freedom to say whatever it is he wants to say about homosexuals. Eric Abetz \u2013 perhaps the loudest conservative in the Liberal party since the voters of Warringah showed Tony Abbot the door \u2013 declared: \u201cThe fundamental point of the need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of religion is in the DNA of every true Liberal and that is why I am seeking to pursue it.\u201d But Senator Abetz has not always felt the need to defend this \u201cfundamental\u201d principle of free speech. Back in 2014 when he was \u201cpublic service minister Eric Abetz\u201d, a public servant working at the Australian Taxation Office resigned after being disciplined for making derogatory comments about conservative commentator Melinda Tankard Reist. Commenting on the case, Abetz said this employee\u2019s departure should act as a lesson for the nation\u2019s 165,000 federal public servants and their use of Twitter and other social media. He then went on to state: \u201cAPS employees need to ensure that they understand the APS values and code of conduct and how they apply to the official and unofficial communications.\u201d Abetz\u2019s inconsistent indifference to the obligations of employees to follow their employer\u2019s codes of conduct makes clear that the fundamental principle motivating him has more to do with protecting fellow Christians than support for freedom of expression. Of course, it\u2019s not just conservatives who get caught up in the contradictions of modern politics. There are plenty of environmentalists who rely heavily on the CSIRO\u2019s climate science but publicly question the reliability of its GM science. Likewise, there will be more than a few people cheering on GoFundMe\u2019s decision to end Folau\u2019s campaign who were outraged at the thought that a baker might refuse to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple. So, what\u2019s going on? Do modern conservatives like new technology or fear it? Do they like freedom of speech or don\u2019t they? And if both conservatives and progressives are capable of inconsistency when it comes to their principles, is there any point (or hope) in having rational debate anymore? I think there is. While the word \u201cideology\u201d gets thrown around more than it used to, the fact is, ideology is less important than it has ever been. These days, so-called free market ideologues in the Liberal party love to subsidise coalmines while tying unions and charities up in the red tape that they claim to hate. So-called socialists in the Greens want to use market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The problem isn\u2019t the policy positions of the \u201cfree-marketeers\u201d or the \u201csocialists\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the increasingly meaningless labels that are being used. Modern conservatives don\u2019t fear technology, they oppose new technologies that harm their friends. Put simply: renewable energy is a threat to the mining industry, but robot trucks and trains will boost the profits of the mining industry. Modern conservatives don\u2019t fear social change. They oppose social change that undermines the power of institutions that they like, such as the church, and they embrace social change like the gig economy because it undermines the power of institutions they fear, like the unions. It\u2019s no longer ideologies that defines and divides Australian politics, but interests. While the philosophical positions adopted by political parties might be all over the shop, the interests they support remain remarkably stable. The right tend to line up behind wealth, power and the establishment, and the left fire up to support new industries that solve new problems, and to protect marginalised groups from established institutions. There\u2019s nothing wrong with such demarcations, but they have less and less to do with ideology. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
