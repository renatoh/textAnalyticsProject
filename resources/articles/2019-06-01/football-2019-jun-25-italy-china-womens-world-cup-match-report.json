We have worked so long and hard to achieve this result.\u201d Her players belatedly delivered 24 hours later, sending Le Azzurre into the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 1991 with a composed two-goal victory over China in Montpellier. Making their tournament return in France after two decades in the footballing wilderness, Bertolini\u2019s side are now only three wins away from lifting the World Cup. \u201cIt is a great gift,\u201d the coach joked afterwards. \u201cI don\u2019t know how far we can go in the tournament. We are giving absolutely everything in every match \u2013 but we know that the further we go in the competition, the higher the level will become.\u201d Following rousing renditions of their respective national anthems under the burning Mediterranean sun, both teams began cautiously \u2013 as if needing a moment to catch their collective breath. Juventus\u2019s Cristiana Girelli created the first opportunity in the 11th minute, slicing open China\u2019s defence with a spectacular turn-and-pass towards Valentina Giacinti. The 25-year-old appeared to have opened her World Cup account with a driving shot past Peng Shimeng only to be called back for offside. Giacinti, making her second start of the tournament, did not have to wait long to compensate for that mistimed run. A darting move down the right-hand flank minutes later left the Milan forward alone and in possession. She crossed the ball, before \u2013 following a scramble in the penalty area \u2013 she collected a deflection from Peng\u2019s attempted charge-down and converted to put Italy in front. Giacinti should have doubled her tally in the first half, finding herself one-on-one with Peng only to shoot wide \u2013 and then again receive another offside call. Such infractions have been a persistent theme of Italy\u2019s campaign; they had two goals disallowed against Australia in the opening group match and another chalked off against Brazil last week. It has not hurt them \u2013 yet. China wrestled back momentum in the latter stages of the first half, almost equalising on several occasions. But the interval halted the Iron Roses\u2019 momentum, and Italy soon regained control. Five minutes after the resumption their first-half substitute, Aurora Galli, effortlessly dispatched the ball from the edge of the penalty area. As it flew into the bottom left corner past a diving Peng, it was clear to the ecstatic Italian fans that a hitherto nervy encounter had virtually been won. Try as they might, China were unable to conjure a reply \u2013 let alone two \u2013 as the half moved towards its conclusion. Italy now return to Valenciennes for Saturday\u2019s quarter-final, their third game in the northern city, against the Netherlands. China, meanwhile, have plenty of soul-searching to undertake on their long journey home. Once a women\u2019s footballing powerhouse and a two-time World Cup host, they have departed the tournament before the quarter-finals for the first-time. Before Tuesday\u2019s game, Italy\u2019s captain, Sara Gama, was asked if her teammates were suffering from vertigo after unexpectedly topping group C . In Montpellier on Tuesday, her team\u2019s clinical victory indicated they do not seem to be afraid of heights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
