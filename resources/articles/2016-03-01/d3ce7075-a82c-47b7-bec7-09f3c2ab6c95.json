Tries from Danny Care, Dan Cole and Anthony Watson were enough to seal the victory despite some nervous moments in the second half when France threatened to find a way back into the game. But 16 points from the boot of Owen Farrell ensured that Jones has turned a team that was eliminated from the World Cup at the group stage has been transformed into the best team in Europe. \u201cWe weren\u2019t at our best today, but we battled through and really deserved the victory. It is a great achievement by the team,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI always had confidence in the team. I thought in the first half we sat back a little bit, and were probably more worried about the result than playing, and the second half we were much more positive in the way we played.\u201d Captain Dylan Hartley was stretchered off with suspected concussion in the second half but Jones admitted the hooker had played a crucial role. \u201cHe\u2019s been fantastic. He\u2019s done a really good job,\u201d he said. \u201cBilly Vunipola and the other guys have been great supporting him. The nucleus of the team have been very good. The best is ahead of us. We\u2019re looking forward to going to Australia and we\u2019re only going to get better.\u201d Farrell added: \u201cIt is brilliant. We set ourselves a goal at the start of the Six Nations to be the most dominant team in Europe, and we have achieved that goal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best of starts for us in the first half, even though we scored a couple of tries, but we showed some character in that second half. I thought the boys were brilliant. We were focused on our job. France are a good side, especially over here. \u201cThis squad has been brilliant since we met up for this Six Nations. We have got better week on week, and built on performances. We got what we deserved after it. I am just chuffed for the boys. I am chuffed for everyone.\u201d Vunipola was arguably England\u2019s most influential performer across the championship, and he was thrilled by the grand slam achievement, which came a week after the title was secured. Vunipola said: \u201cThis means a great deal. We have had a great eight weeks, and to come out on top and win every game after what happened at the World Cup, which no-one can forget about, it\u2019s a great achievement for us. \u201cI just thank God for giving me the opportunity, and I am just so happy right now. \u201cYou could hear how loud the crowd was. I am sure they didn\u2019t want us to come here and win a Grand Slam on their home soil, and that is a credit to them. \u201cBut more credit goes to my team and the way we stood up to them in a tough first half, and we eventually came out on top.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
