She was a country girl who just wanted to tell an honest story about life as she saw it,\u201d the Obama family said in a statement. \u201cBut what that one story did, more powerfully than one hundred speeches possibly could, was change the way we saw each other, and then the way we saw ourselves,\u201d they continued. \u201cThrough the uncorrupted eyes of a child, she showed us the beautiful complexity of our common humanity, and the importance of striving for justice in our own lives, our communities, and our country.\u201d Lee was hailed as a brilliant writer and an extraordinary woman by those who paid tribute to her \u2013 a crowd that included the friends who knew her and those who were inspired by her. \u201cKnowing Nelle these past few years has been not just an utter delight but an extraordinary privilege,\u201d said her literary agent, Andrew Nurnberg, in a statement.\u201cWhen I saw her just six weeks ago, she was full of life, her mind and mischievous wit as sharp as ever. She was quoting Thomas More and setting me straight on Tudor history. We have lost a great writer, a great friend and a beacon of integrity.\u201d The president and publisher of HarperCollins US, Michael Morrison, also commented on the loss of one of the publishing house\u2019s most famous authors. \u201cThe world knows Harper Lee was a brilliant writer but what many don\u2019t know is that she was an extraordinary woman of great joyfulness, humility and kindness. She lived her life the way she wanted to \u2013 in private \u2013 surrounded by books and the people who loved her. I will always cherish the time I spent with her,\u201d Morrison said. Aaron Sorkin, the writer of The West Wing and The Social Network who last week announced he was working on a Broadway adaption of Lee\u2019s Pulitzer-winning 1960 novel about racial prejudice in the American south, told the Guardian: \u201cLike millions of others, I was saddened to learn this morning of the passing of Harper Lee, one of America\u2019s most beloved authors.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to adapt her seminal novel for the stage.\u201d Sorkin added in his statement. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who has spoken previously about how Lee was one of two interviews she\u2019d failed to get, recounted a line the author told her over a lunch. Ava DuVernay, director of the civil rights drama Selma, shared a still from the 1962 film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird starring Gregory Peck on Twitter. Former US president George W Bush, who awarded Lee the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007 in one of the most public outings of her later years, released a statement mourning the \u201clegendary novelist and lovely lady\u201d. \u201cHarper Lee was ahead of her time, and her masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird prodded America catch up with her,\u201d Bush said. \u201cLaura [Bush] and I are grateful for Harper Lee and her matchless contributions to humanity and to the character of our country,\u201d he added. Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, also paid tribute to the author with one of her own quotes. Science fiction author Stephen King acknowledged Lee\u2019s great contribution to Truman Capote\u2019s non-fiction crime classic In Cold Blood. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia revealed how To Kill a Mockingbird had an impact on his own career. Young adult fiction author John Green, whose books include The Fault in Our Stars, Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska, recounted a story on Twitter about receiving a signed copy of his book from the notoriously media-shy author after the birth of his son."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
