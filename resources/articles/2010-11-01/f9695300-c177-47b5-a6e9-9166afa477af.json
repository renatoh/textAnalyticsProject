Random chunks from random, badly recorded Bach scores are scattered throughout the work's 60 minutes, spliced together with gritty \"sound\" interludes of drains gurgling, machinery grinding, cars revving. And what makes this dull collage hard to forgive is not just that we've heard so many variations on the form so many times before, but that this one lacks any justifying choreographic or theatrical point. But that's just one of a long list of lazy banalities. A programme note expounds Smits's work as an exploration of sex and the sacred; a love letter to dancing, and a marriage of different forms. Big ideas all of them, but what they translate to are just more cliches. Nine male dancers occupy a bare white stage, their default demeanour veering between calm piety and cheerful undress \u2013 at regular intervals they get to slip out of their T-shirts and show off their nicely ripped biceps and abs. The choreography Smits gives them is a fashionably globalised mix, modern dance combined with a few balletic flourishes, slow-motion capoeira balances and hunkered-down hop-hop moves. Yet while this material might sound lively, if over familiar, it's mushed by Smits into an earnest grey soup of solos, duets and ensembles, in which any colour, rhythm or flavour distinct to each ingredient is lost. I feel bad for the dancers, who perform the work with a genuinely engaging camaraderie, and without a trace of narcissim. But if this is what Smits offers to the ones he loves, be afraid of the hate mail. \u2022 This article was amended on November 22 2010. The original referred to the piece as For The Ones I Love.
