The letter sent to Suella Braverman QC is highly critical of rhetorical attacks on \u201clefty\u201d and \u201cactivist\u201d lawyers made by Boris Johnson and the home secretary, Priti Patel. The mass action by senior lawyers is the latest evidence of widespread concern within the legal profession about the government\u2019s approach to upholding the rule of law. Last month Johnson and Patel were accused in a letter to the Guardian signed by more than 800 former judges and senior legal figures of endangering the personal safety of lawyers through their attacks. In August the Home Office published a video on Twitter blaming \u201cactivist lawyers\u201d for frustrating the department\u2019s efforts to deport people with no right to remain in the UK. The video was later withdrawn. Last month at the Conservative party conference, Patel broadened her targets, claiming that among those defending the \u201cindefensible\u201d and \u201cbroken\u201d immigration appeals system were \u201cdo-gooders, lefty lawyers, the Labour party\u201d. In his conference speech, Johnson went further, declaring he would prevent \u201cthe whole criminal justice system from being hamstrung by what the home secretary would doubtless \u2013 and rightly \u2013 call the lefty human rights lawyers, and other do-gooders\u201d. Last month a man appeared in court charged with carrying out a racist attack on a firm of immigration lawyers in London. Cavan Medlock, 28, from Harrow, faces six charges including preparing an act of terrorism. He has not yet entered a plea. The letter to Braverman, sent on 28 October, is signed by more than 170 members of the attorney general\u2019s A, B and C panels. They are barristers recognised for their expertise who are instructed to represent the government in legal actions. \u201cWe are writing in a personal capacity to share our serious concerns about recent criticisms of \u2018lefty\u2019 and \u2018activist\u2019 lawyers by senior government ministers including the prime minister and the home secretary,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIt has long been a recognised and valued tradition of the attorney general\u2019s panels that its members act both for and against government \u2026 This reflects the value to government of having access to high-quality, independent legal advice from a diverse range of counsel. \u201cThe emotive language politicising lawyers in the recent speeches undermines this system. Criticising lawyers, such as ourselves and our colleagues, for acting fearlessly on behalf of our clients in accordance with our professional duties serves to reduce public confidence in the legal system on which the rule of law depends. \u201cIt also risks undermining the credibility of Treasury counsel within this system. We invite the government to consider these points and to refrain from using such language in the future.\u201d The letter was signed by 23 QCs and more than 150 other barristers. It is unusual for barristers on the attorney general\u2019s panels to publicise their criticism. They last spoke out in 2013 over deep cuts to legal aid imposed by the government. Apart from its attacks on \u201clefty\u201d lawyers, the government has faced a series of damaging resignations by senior government-appointed lawyers over the internal market bill, which authorises ministers to breach international law. Among those who have left in protest at the legislation are Sir Jonathan Jones, the former head of the government legal service, Lord Keen, the government\u2019s advocate general for Scotland, and Amal Clooney, the high-profile human rights lawyer who was the UK\u2019s special envoy on media freedom. Replying to the panel barristers, Braverman said: \u201cI have no hesitation in standing up for the role of lawyers in our justice system. \u201cPride in the profession does not, however, mean that the legal profession is somehow immune from criticism. Where there may be concerns that any lawyer is not acting in accordance with the professional standards expected of them, our system of independent regulation will, as it has always done, continue to ensure that high standards are met.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
