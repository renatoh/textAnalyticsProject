The two most seriously injured are in hospitals in Barcelona, the Catalonian capital. At least 10 police officers are said to have been injured. Carles Puigdemont, the region\u2019s president, has said Catalonia has \u201cearned the right to [be] an independent state\u201d following the day\u2019s events. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy said in a televised address: \u201cToday there has not been a self-determination referendum in Catalonia. The rule of law remains in force with all its strength.\u201d Although advocates of the vote stressed the right to political self-determination, the vote was banned by Spain\u2019s constitutional court and millions of ballot papers were confiscated before the vote. The Spanish interior ministry said 336 voting centres, out of more than 2,000 across the region, had been closed by local and national police. Videos show police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters hold up their hands, police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters. Polls have shown 70% of Catalans want to be able to vote in a referendum but they are more evenly divided when it comes to independence. There have been several calls by Catalan politicians and opposition MPs for the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to resign over the hardline police response. Human Rights Watch has released a statement calling on Spanish authorities to respect their citizens\u2019 right to peaceful assembly and refrain from using excessive force. The Labour party has condemned the police violence. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable for the Spanish authorities to overreact to today\u2019s events through aggressive police action and the forcible closure of polling stations.\u201d Guy Verhofstadt made the first condemnation by a senior EU politician, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to interfere in the domestic issues of Spain but I absolutely condemn what happened today in Catalonia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
