Tomorrow Clinton is to visit Cairo, where President Mohamed Morsi has been mediating between Israel and Hamas. \u2022 The death toll in Gaza reached 133, according to a Palestinian health official's count as quoted by a BBC employee. Other counts put the number higher. The Sabbah report names 130 fatalities, including 18 from today. Three journalists and at least one child were among the fatalities in Gaza Tuesday. \u2022 An Israeli soldier and a civilian were killed in a rocket strike east of Gaza, bringing the death toll in Israel to five. The IDF said more than 140 rockets were launched from Gaza Tuesday, causing a significant number of injuries. \u2022 Militants executed six men in public in Gaza today, accusing them of collaborating with Israel. At least one of the men's bodies was dragged through the streets behind a motor bike. \u2022 An Israeli strike hit the building housing the Agence France Presse offices in Gaza, and the IDF directed a warning to \"stay away from Hamas\" specifically at reporters. \u2022 Jordanian king Abdullah spoke with Israeli premier Netanyahu on the phone and warned him against a ground invasion. Netanyahu said in a news conference with Clinton that Israel would spare no measure to protect its citizens. \u2022 View our midday summary here for further updates. The IDF is now singling out reporters for warnings to \"stay away from Hamas.\" The building housing the AFP offices in Gaza has been hit in an apparent Israeli strike. No injuries have been reported. UPDATE: A second strike on the building, as originally reported, has not been confirmed. The \"Neema\" building in central Gaza may have been hit just once. Israeli strikes killed three journalists earlier today. The Shurooq media center was hit last week and again Monday, killing one. The phrase \"operational failure,\" used to refer to civilian casualties, may be the \"collatoral damage\" of this conflict. As yet it's unclear how many of the 20-plus (possibly 30+) people killed in Gaza Tuesday were civilians. In a Daily Beast piece this morning, Emily L. Hauser notes that \"From the end of September 2000 through the end of September 2012, Israel was responsible for the deaths of 3,034 Palestinian noncombatants, of whom well more than a third were minors: 1,338.\" The numbers are from B'Tselem, which will have to add to those totals when the present conflict is through. Hauser's piece concludes: I can no longer keep track of all the Israeli and American Jews who have contacted me in recent days to tell me (as if I might not have yet heard) that Hamas intentionally targets civilians, and Israel does not. But when I look at those numbers, when I see the pictures of tiny, broken bodies pulled from utter destruction, when I see the wailing of fathers and mothers, their dead children wrapped in white shrouds, never to feel their parents\u2019 arms around them again\u2014I no longer care. Incompetence or indifference, neither can be an excuse anymore. And in the meantime, more children die. Five Israelis have been killed since the latest round of full-scale hostilities began a week ago. Three residents of an apartment building in Kiryat Malakhi were killed in a rocket strike last Thursday. Today an Israeli soldier, Joseph Partuk, 18, was killed in rocket strike near Eshkol. The attack also killed one civilian, who, according to activist Abir Kopty, was a Bedouin man, Aleyan Alnabari, from the Naqab. \"Defense Ministry says civilian killed in mortar attack earlier Tuesday is Eliyan Salem el-Nabari, a ministry worker of Bedouin descent,\" Haaretz reports. \"Two other workers were lightly wounded in the volley.\" The report locates the attack in the Eshkol area. The IDF reports that 111 inside Israel were wounded on Tuesday alone, although it is unclear how it arrived at that number, which spokeswoman Avital Leibovich describes as \"unbelievable but true.\" More than 140 rockets were reportedly fired from the Gaza Strip toward southern Israel on Tuesday, of which 51 were said to have been intercepted by the Iron Dome system. As Tuesday draws near an end with no cease-fire agreement, the bombardment of Gaza continues. Rushdi Abualouf, who works for the BBC in Gaza, quotes a health official as saying the death toll in the last seven days has reached 133, with more than 1,000 wounded. Other sources have tracked higher numbers. The Palestine From My Eyes blog by Shahd Abusalama names 141 victims in Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces reported strikes on 133 targets in Gaza Tuesday. The Iron Dome system intercepted 51 rockets fired from Gaza, according to the army, which said it had struck 1,500 targets in total since Wednesday. Israel says it has hit a bank, a Hamas command center and safe house, a weapons storage site and factories in the last few hours, Haaretz reports. US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has just spoken at a news conference with Israeli PM Netanyahu. There was no announcement of a cease-fire or truce agreement. The two leaders are now holding a private meeting. Clinton said there is an effort to \"de-escalate\" the situation to restore \"a broader calm.\" Clinton announces she will travel to Cairo tomorrow and will consult with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Reuters' resourceful Matthew Keys captures audio of Clinton's statement: \"I want to thank President Obama, you, and the American government and people for their strong support of Israel in its hour of need,\" Netanyahu begins. He singles out the Iron Dome program for special appreciation. Clinton says \"President Obama asked me to come to Israel with a very clear message: America's commitment to Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. That's why we believe it is essential to deescalate the situation in Gaza. The rocket attacks... must end, and a broader calm restored.\"[...] \"We appreciate [Egyptian] President [Mohamed] Morsi's personal leadership and Egypt's efforts thus far...\" she says. \"Egypt has the opportunity and responsibility to continue playing a crucial and constructive role in this process,\" Clinton says. She says she is \"very pleased\" with the Iron Dome defense system, which she says is a good example of the US commitment to Israeli security. \"Today was a difficult day, and I offer my deepest condolences to those whose loved ones were lost and injured,\" she says. She mentions \"civilians on both sides.\" \"In the days ahead, the US will work with our partners... toward an outcome that bolsters security for the people of Israel and improves conditions\" in Gaza, she concludes. Jordanian king Abdullah called Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu today and \"warned\" him of ramifications of a further escalation in Gaza, Haaretz diplomatic correspondent Barak Ravid reports. \"The halting of the [military] escalation in all its forms what will open the way for diplomatic efforts and calm,\" Abdullah is quoted as saying. The king also spoke with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, \"asking him to increase his efforts to achieve a cease-fire.\" US secretary of state Clinton and Israeli PM Netanyahu will hold a press conference tonight. It's now just past 11pm in Jerusalem. Meanwhile the Israeli foreign minister claims a \"green light from our citizens to continue attacks.\" The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg sees strong support for Israel on the part of the Obama administration \u2013 despite what Mitt Romney backer Sheldon Adelson thought: BuzzFeed's Zeke Miller looks at how the test of a second-term President Obama's support for Israel is playing out: The test came fast, when Israeli reacted to a drumbeat of missile strikes by turning its firepower on the Gaza Strip within days of the election. And the American reaction has, so far, surprised those who expected a post-election pivot. And with the region hoping Hillary Clinton\u2019s visit will bring a ceasefire, Israelis have so far had few complaints. \u201cIf funding iron dome is Obama's way of throwing Israel under the bus, I am praying he will throw us under a train,\u201d tweeted Israeli reporter Barak Ravid, who writes for the center-left newspaper Haaretz, referring to the American-backed missile defense system. An Israeli strike destroyed houses in Egypt near the Rafah border crossing, the Egypt Independent reports: A security source said that Israeli F-16 fired missiles at tunnels and houses adjacent to the border. \u201cThe armed forces stopped filling the tunnels due to the missile attack on the tunnels area,\u201d the source added. It was unclear from the report who was filling what tunnels. The report of destroyed houses inside Egypt has not been independently verified. UPDATE: The Times of Israel reports the army is striking tunnels used for getting gas past the Gaza siege. Additional reports of a stalled cease-fire negotiation, now on both Israeli TV and Al-Jazeera, with sourcing from both Hamas and, according to at least one report, the Israeli foreign ministry. Multiple reports are emerging that there will be no cease-fire agreement tonight. It's 10:30 pm locally. The situation is fluid and could change at any moment. The news ascribed to Israeli television has not been independently confirmed by the Guardian. Al-Jazeera interviews badly wounded survivors of the Hijazi family, whose home in the Jibaliya camp in northern Gaza was destroyed by an Israeli strike Monday, killing two young boys and the father. The strike came as the family watched TV: JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP: \"For a split second I thought it had struck our neighbour\u2019s home. The next thing I know, I\u2019m waking up in hospital,\" said 19-year-old Nour Hijazi, lying in a hospital bed in Jabaliya\u2019s Kamal Edwan Hospital with a shattered spine. The Hijazi family, consisting of six boys and two girls, were sitting with their parents watching television on Monday evening when the Israeli missile hit their home, killing three of them, and seriously wounding the rest. \"I\u2019m really angry and upset that my whole family were injured in this,\" she said. Nour, in her final year at school, has yet to be told that her two brothers, four-year-old Mohammad and two-year-old Suhaib, and her father Fouad, were killed in the airstrike. Read the full report here. US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has reportedly landed in Israel and is on her way to a meeting with premier Binyamin Netanyahu. Will she leave with nothing to show? Reuters picks up signs of complications in an effort to reach a cease-fire deal today. More details on the three al-Aqsa journalists killed today in Israeli strikes in Gaza, via Reuters: Their deaths have sparked outrage among Gaza's press corps and also from Hamas, which accused Israel of trying to suppress coverage of Israeli attacks in the coastal enclave. \"The Israeli aggressors want to cut the picture and silence the voice of the brave people of Gaza. Journalism in Gaza plays a major, effective role in exposing the enemy's crimes to the world,\" Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told a news conference. For its part, Israel says it takes pains only to strike combatants and warns civilians away from its strikes, which have killed over 125 Palestinians in six days of fighting, around half of them civilians, including around 30 children. Atia Darwish tweets a picture of two Al-Aqsa photographers who were killed in their car, Mahmud Komi, left, and Hossam Salama. Awaiting a news conference in Cairo. Sheera Frenkel is with the Times of London. From an Associated Press report on the execution today in Gaza of six suspected Israeli spies, at least one of whose bodies was tied to a motorbike and dragged in the streets: Masked gunmen publicly shot dead six suspected collaborators with Israel in a large Gaza City intersection Tuesday, witnesses said. An Associated Press reporter saw a large mob surrounding five of the bloodied corpses shortly after the killing. Some in the crowd stomped and spat on the bodies. A sixth corpse was tied to a motorcycle and dragged through the streets as people screamed, \"Spy! Spy!\" The Hamas military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam, claimed responsibility in a large handwritten note attached to a nearby electricity pole. Hamas said the six were killed because they gave Israel information about fighters and rocket launching sites. Full story here. The Washington Post has a slide show from the funeral of Salem Paul Sweliem in Gaza City. \"According to the family, the 52-year-old Greek Orthodox Christian carpenter was killed during an Israeli airstrike on a high-rise building,\" the Post reports. This is strange. The correspondent for France 24 in Egypt is out for dinner at the swish Intercontinental hotel in Cairo and finds herself sitting next to ... Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal. Cease-fire talks? She says \"conference canceled,\" seemingly referring to a news conference. There are reports of Apache helicopters attacking in Gaza. @RanaGaza records one strike (in a recording that ends with what sounds like a child's cry). \"Usually [the helicopters] stand still in the sky prior to an attack,\" she writes to @acarvin. \"I believe they are targeting west of Gaza.\" The IDF says it is targeting \"mainly underground rocket launchers.\" The current conflict could strengthen Hamas in Gaza, although it's unclear how long Hamas would succeed at preventing other groups from firing rockets in the event of a cease-fire, Hugh Naylor writes in the National: But since Hamas fired hundreds of rockets in response to Israel's assassination of its top military commander last week, criticism from other militant groups in Gaza has softened - at least for now. \"It may take some time, but these tensions are bound to surface again,\" said Talal Okal, who lives in Gaza and is an independent analyst and expert on Hamas. \"And this could mean just another cycle of violence like we've just experienced.\" The fighting only weakens Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas further, Alistair Lyon writes for Reuters: \"These diplomatic gains strengthen Hamas's argument that it is an integral part of the future of the region, while the Palestinian Authority is part of the past,\" said Ghassan al-Khatib, an academic and a former spokesman for Abbas's PA. Israel, meanwhile, has no chance for \"victory,\" Roger Cohen writes in the New York Times: Is all this good for Israel? No. Unless good is defined as policies that radicalize the situation, erode middle ground, demonstrate the impossibility of agreement, and so facilitate continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the expansion of settlements there and the steady eclipse of the idea of a two-state peace. This may well be Netanyahu\u2019s criteria for a tactical victory from Operation Pillar of Defense (along with victory for Likud on Jan. 22.) There will be no other Israeli \u201cvictory.\u201d As Aluf Benn, editor in chief of the Israeli daily Haaretz, commented, \u201cThe assassination of Jabari will go down in history as another showy military action initiated by an outgoing government on the eve of an election.\u201d Jabari, Benn argued, was in effect Israel\u2019s point man in a money-for-truce exchange that worked imperfectly. Now, \u201cIsrael will have to find a new subcontractor to replace Ahmed Jabari as its border guard in the south.\u201d Iran's foreign minister said Tuesday that Palestinians should be \"equipped\" to defend themselves against Israel, Reuters reports: But on Tuesday, Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast refused to comment directly on whether Iran was supplying Hamas with the Fajr-5 rockets. \"The question of which country has produced these missiles is best discussed by military officials who have expertise in this matter,\" Mehmanparast was quoted as saying by the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA). \"What is important is that the people of Palestine must be equipped to defend themselves, and it is the responsibility of all countries to defend the rights of the people of Palestine.\" Rana Baker in Gaza City records a round of heavy strikes moments ago. The incessant sound of drones is punctuated by a jet flying through and the thud of explosions, which pick up in frequency as the recording progresses. She records the time of attack as Nov. 20 8:50 pm. Nour Samaha is a reporter for Al-Jazeera English. Foreign Policy's David Kenner catches an Economist report that discloses the name of the previously unidentified high-level Israeli negotiator in Cairo. The Economist: Hence Israel\u2019s interest in an early ceasefire. Its generals have offered to hold fire if Hamas does, and Mr Netanyahu has sent as his chief negotiator, Yitzhak Molcho, to Cairo to negotiate terms. But Hamas is pressing for a more formal arrangement, including guarantees that Israel will halt assassinations and normalise trade relations. It wants Israel to lift its land and sea blockade, and restore access to what were hitherto its primary markets in the West Bank and Israel. It also wants Egypt to re-open the border crossing at Rafah to goods traffic. My colleague Mona Mahmood has been speaking with Gaza residents by phone. She has interviewed Hanan Abdul Razaq, who talks about life under fire and her hopes for a truce: People were talking on the telephone about a truce at 5 pm today, but nothing on the ground. Rockets keep falling all the time. I hope there will be a truce to stop the bloodshed and shelling of the houses in Gaza. But they are only fairy tales. Can you believe it, the world is celebrating Children's Day today, and the Palestinian children are smashed under the Israeli machine guns now. I do not have power now to watch the TV and get updated on the latest developments. Power is given to us for six hours only. I seize the opportunity when the power is on to do many things as quickly as possible, like making bread, food for the children and other things. I have four kids and it is really difficult to keep them quiet during the bombardment. The shelling is completely abnormal, it feels like an earthquake. The whole building where my flat is feels like it is moving when a bomb falls. I feel as if the building does not have a foundation and is disconnected from the ground. I do not know what will happen to us, but I and my family are not considering leaving. I know some people who started to flee to other supposedly safe areas, but I do not think there is any. People are not going to work. Kids are not going to school - in fact UNRWA has opened its schools to the families who needs shelters or lost their houses in the bombardment. Till now we have water but I do not know if this will last for long. I remember in the war of 2008, we had water in the first week and then it was cut. Also it is not that easy to get vegetables as most of the farmers are at the outskirts of Gaza, and who dares to leave his house? Some people did not get their salaries yet, and have no money to buy food and other basic things. Few shops are opened for people to get food or other materials they need, especially shops that are opened within the houses. It is difficult for people to reach a pharmacy or a hospital and some of the people who live at the suburbs of Gaza are coming to the centre now, thinking it is safer. It is really hard to predict what the coming days will bring with them but we have great faith in God to protect us and bring peace to Gaza. The Guardian's Chris McGreal reports intensified strikes in north Gaza. Hama's Al-Qassam Brigades tweets a picture of Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu crying over a dead body in Gaza on his visit there today with the Arab League delegation. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was quoted yesterday as calling Israel a \"terrorist state.\" Relations between the two countries soured when an Israeli assault on a flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza in May 2010 killed nine Turkish nationals. My colleague Ewen MacAskill reports that the Obama administration has protested to the Turkish government over \"harsh\" comments by Erdogan labelling Israel a terrorist state: The complaint direct from the US state department to the Turkish government comes in spite of the countries being allies and Washington being dependent on Turkey, along with Egypt and Qatar, to try to help broker an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire. Victoria Nuland, the state department spokeswoman, in the daily briefing in Washington, was reluctant to condemn Erdogan's comment on Monday but was unequivocal in her reaction Tuesday. She said the US had made its position clear. \"Some of the extremely harsh rhetoric coming from Turkey we do not regard as helpful at all and we have made this clear to the Turkish governnment,\" Nuland said. There are reports of Israeli cross-border fire into northern Gaza. \u2022 As diplomatic efforts to produce a cease-fire continued in Cairo and Jerusalem, Israeli strikes on Gaza continued. Palestinian reports put the death toll in Gaza at 135 since last Wednesday. \u2022 An Israeli soldier based in Eshkol east of Gaza died in a rocket attack. Haaretz reports that a civilian was killed as well. An unknown number were wounded. \u2022 A Hamas spokesman said a cessation deal of some kind had been agreed to, but Israeli officials said there was no agreement. The discrepancy may spring from the difference between a cease-fire and a longer-term agreement addressing each side's major demands. Diplomatic activity continued as UN secretary general Ban ki-Moon met with Israeli president Shimon Peres in Jerusalem. \u2022 US secretary of state Hillary Clinton was due in Jerusalem this evening to meet with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. President Obama spoke with Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi three times over the course of 24 hours. A delegation of foreign ministers and the Arab League chief visited Gaza today. \u2022 An Israeli strike on a vehicle killed two journalists for Hamas' Al-Aqsa station. There were reports that a third journalist for Al-Aqsa, the \"head of educational radio,\" had also been killed. \u2022 Israeli dropped leaflets over large portions of Gaza warning residents to evacuate border areas and stay away from Hamas. Thousands took shelter in UN-run schools. Thousands more have not evacuated. Hamas leaders told fighters to prepare for an Israeli ground incursion. \u2022 Our earlier summary of events in Syria and elsewhere is here. My colleague Ewen MacAskill reports that in its daily briefing the State Department talked about paths forward in the Gaza conflict that did not entail a full cease-fire: Victoria Nuland, the state department spokeswoman, said the US would welcome any \"de-escalation as a step forward\". She was careful to avoid saying that it had to be a full ceasefire. She said she would not go beyond that because \"the talks are still going on and we are going to be part of that.\" An Israeli civilian was also killed in the attack on Eshkol, Haaretz reports. Civilian also killed in mortar attack on Eshkol Regional Council earlier in the day (Gili Cohen) Other reports indicate many civilians may have been wounded in the attack. The bombardment of northern Gaza appears to be picking up. An Israeli soldier has died of wounds from a \"mortar attack\" out of Gaza, Haaretz reports: Lifted gag order reveals that an IDF soldier was killed in Gaza mortar attack on the Eshkol Regional Council earlier in the day (Gili Cohen) Eshkol is to the east of Gaza. Ynet confirms the death. UPDATE: the soldier was Cpl Joseph Partuk, 18. An anti-Israeli protest inside the Bahraini parliament. Reuters' Matthew Keys is watching US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's briefing on Gaza. She says that \" \"All of the parties involved have expressed a preference to solve this...peacefully.\" The diplomatic maneuvering continues. A Jerusalem Post headline from today, \"Sirens causing some pets to suffer from anxiety,\" has precipitated an outpouring of disgust and frustration at its preoccupation with animal nerves while human blood is being spilled. The story has also spawned a parody Twitter account, @IDFPet. The Guardian's Peter Beaumont reports on how the Arabic term 'hudna' and the way it's being translated could be contributing to confusion surrounding a potential cease-fire agreement. If Hamas and Israeli officials seem to be saying two different things, Beaumont writes \u2013 it might be because they are: When we say \u201cceasefire\u201d in English in the context of ending a conflict we tend to know what we mean, a negotiated settlement to bring an end to hostilities. In recent context of conflicts between Israel and Palestinian factions there is another more nuanced concept that can cause problems. That is the notion of the hudna \u2013 an armistice or calm. A hudna is more like the word truce in English. While it implies an end of violence it does not necessarily require either side to give up their claims. It can be long but does not imply a resolution of either the causes of the conflict or a peace agreement. Its historical and religious basis was a 10-year treaty struck by the Prophet Mohammed. It carries with it the obligation to seek a permanent resolution and cessation of hostilities. In the context of the history of hostilities between Hamas and Israel, Hamas has offered previous hudnas which have led to periods of at least relative calm. Where the confusion may have been introduced in the reporting of the \u201cceasefire\u201d is that before the outbreak of hostilities a longer-term more formal ceasefire had been under negotiation. That long-term ceasefire proposal, which Israeli Prime Minister Bionyamin Netanyahu has said Israel could be a \u201cwilling partner in\u201d, is back on the table. The question right now is which concept is being discussed. When Hamas spokesman in Cairo Ayman Taha spoke on Tuesday he referred to a \u201ccalm.\u201d My own understanding of where the negotiations were when Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi \u2013 one of the principal intermediaries \u2013 spoke is that he was referring to the fighting stopping. Other issues, it has been implied \u2013 such as the lifting of the economic blockade on Gaza, and both sides seeking guarantees \u2013 would be dealt with in due course in ceasefire negotiations. This suggestion of a two-stage process, however, does not have the support of all within Hamas or the Palestinian factions, perhaps, explaining the televised intervention of Mohamed Deif, Hamas's military commander in Gaza, when he said his men were preparing for a ground invasion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as always in conflict, a large degree of uncertainty remains. Haaretz's diplomatic correspondent reports that Israeli officials \"are taking now a very hard line\" on a potential cease-fire: The BBC's Paul Danahar, who has been in Gaza for the duration of the present conflict, sees signs that many Gazans in the north are not responding to the Israeli order to evacuate border areas. The IDF tweets an image of the building hit with a rocket in Rishon LeZion, just south of Tel Aviv. Although there were no firm reports of casualties in the incident, IDF spokeswoman Avital Leibovich tweeted, \"Probably one person wounded lightly.\" Tom McCarthy here in New York, with this dispatch from Guardian Washington bureau chief Ewen MacAskill, who reports on the latest contact between President Obama and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Obama praised Morsi for his involvement: Obama is flying back from Camodia to Washington. During the flight, he spoke to Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi for the third time in less than 24 hours. Acknowledging the pivotal role of the Egyptian government in negotiating the ceasefire, Obama repeatedly praised Morsi. The White House national security spokesman, Ben Rhodes, said: \u201cPresident Obama underscored once again the importance of working for a de-escalation to the conflict in Gaza. He commended president Morsi\u2019s efforts to pursue a de-escalation.\" Rhodes added: \"He also underscored that president Morsi\u2019s efforts reinforce the important role that president Morsi and Egypt play on behalf of regional security and the pursuit of broader peace between the Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d Obama had spoken to Morsi immediately after a dinner with Asian leaders Phnom Penh and again at 2.30 am Cambodia time. Rhodes reiterated that any resolution has to involve the cessation of rocket fire into Israel and warned of dire consequences if this did not happen. \u201cWithout an end to rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, Israel can\u2019t be assured of the security of its people,\u201d he said. He warned of \u201csignificant loss of life\u201d if the situation cannot be de-escalated. Meanwhile group of foreign ministers including Mohamed Amr of Egypt and Arab League head Nabil Elaraby has just crossed into Gaza in a sign of solidary. The latest figures from the health ministry are 126 killed in Gaza since the start of the Israeli military operation and 1,000 injured, says the BBC's Jon Donnison. He adds that 18 people have been killed today, including three children and the two journalists from al-Aqsa TV. Two journalists from Hamas-run al-Aqsa TV have been killed by an air strike that struck a car in Gaza city, according to Hamas's military wing and Palestinian media reports. It appears that Hamas official Ayman Taha may have jumped the gun in telling Reuters a truce had been agreed. Several reports suggest it has not been finalised. The Associated Press cites a \"senior Hamas official\" saying a truce is close but has not been agreed. Haaretz says senior Israeli officials close to the negotiations hope \"the deal's last points will be finalized in a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, due to take place at 10pm\". The BBC's Jon Donnison also expresses caution. Just as airstrikes continue despite a supposed imminent ceasefire, so do rocket attacks. The Israel Defence Forces say a rocket fired from Gaza hit a building in the central Israeli city of Rishon LeZion. Reuters reports that a truce will be declared at 7pm GMT (9pm local time) and will go into effect at 10pm GMT (midnight local), citing Hamas official Ayman Taha. Meanwhile air strikes continue, after thousands of leaflets were dropped in Gaza telling people to move out of several areas. More lines on a possible ceasefire agreement: A Hamas official is now confirming that a ceasefire agreement has been reached and will come in effect tonight. Haaretz said details remain to be finalised at a meeting between Benyamin Netanyahu and Hillary Clinton tonight. A Hamas official has confirmed the proposed truce to the BBC. But the Ma'an news agency says some of the Gaza parties involved reject an Israeli proposal to implement a truce deal in two stages. Palestinian People's Party official Walid al-Awad said Israel is asking for a halt to rockets for 48 hours in exchange for stopping airstrikes as a first stage of a truce deal. In the second stage, Israel promised to study factions' other demands, including lifting the blockade, stopping all military operations, and ending the targeting of Palestinian fishermen off Gaza's coast, al-Awad said. This Google map shows some of the areas Gazans have been told to evacuate, in leaflets dropped by the Israeli air force. Click on the pointers to see the name of the areas. Sky News's Tom Rayner's has tweeted a translation of one of the leaflets. It says: This fight is temporary and the end of it you will all return to your homes. By following these orders you will not be harmed. Northern Gaza has been hit by Israeli rockets and shelling on and off during the day, Chris McGreal reports from the area. The attacks were intermingled with leaflet drops which at first generally warned Palestinians to stay away from Hamas, but then a second wave of leaflets told people in some areas to immediately evacuate their houses. Palestinians were unsure whether that meant there will be an intensified air and tank bombardment or a ground invasion, before an anticipated ceasefire comes into effect. Many families made for UN-run schools closer to Gaza City in the hope that they would be not be protected from attack, although Palestinians are generally resigned to the fact that almost nowhere is safe. If Israel is planning a last minute ground offensive, it may be a limited one aimed at seizing open areas in the north of the Gaza Strip from which many of the rockets have been launched toward Israel. But whether or not a ceasefire is in the offing, the killing continues. The victims included Suhaib and Mohammed Hejazi, aged 3 and 4, and their father Fuad, killed when an Israeli missile hit their house in Beit Lahiya as they were sleeping. The boys' mother, Amna, was badly wounded. At the funeral procession through the streets of Beit Lahiya, the boys were swaddled in white cloth and Hamas flags. They might have been mistaken for sleeping if it weren't for the bruising and cuts to their faces. Samir Zaqout, Gaza resident and head of the al Mezan centre for Human Rights, describes how he tries to comfort his five children during Israeli bombardment. Speaking to Mona Mahmood he said: The whole house shakes when the shelling starts. It is terrifying. Death feels very close. The children get even more scared when they watch the news. I try to distract their attention by telling them stories or playing card with them. I keep telling them that our house is safe, and that there is no sensitive site near us. I do my best to comfort the kids but I\u2019m terrified myself. There is no sign of any ceasefire. Despite the highly sophisticated intelligence of the Israeli forces, they are deliberately targeting civilians Initially they targeted government buildings and training sites for resistance brigades, but now, most of the victims are civilians. They are trying to terrify civilians rather than achieve military goals. More than 43 houses have been targeted by the Israeli forces so far. Most of these houses (31) were pre-warned with small rockets dropped by drones. Some people were lucky enough to leave in time others could not. Children have been killed by these warning rockets when playing outside houses. When the Israeli forces targeted the police headquarters in the centre of the city, they used rockets of massive destruction that destroyed houses around the building. They knew this would happen. As soon as it gets dark here, they shoot anything that moves. Any movements even at the early evening hours, will expose you to the risk of being killed or injured. A child and his uncle were shot in the early evening when they went out to check on the boy\u2019s grandfather. Some people trust the Israeli drones and think they only hit military targets, but civilians are not safe. More leaflets warning people in Gaza to move for their own safety have dropped by the Israeli Defence Forces, reporters in the enclave say. Here is video of William Hague's statement, in which he announced that Britain is officially recognising the Syrian opposition. The Palestinian Ma'an news agency says at least six people have been killed by Israeli air strikes on two cars in Gaza City, taking today's death toll across the enclave to to 13. The report says: Israeli warplanes fired missiles on the Sabra neighborhood, entirely destroying one of the vehicles, witnesses said. Three others were critically injured. The remains of the victims were brought to Gaza hospital. Three were identified by medics as Subhi Dughmush, Salah Dughmush and Ahmad Dughmush. It does not say whether the people in the cars were civilians. Local journalists have told BBC reporters that Hamas have executed six people for being Israeli informers. Palestinian families are taking refuge in UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) schools, tweets the Washington Post's Abigail Hauslohner. Meanwhile, UNRWA has accused the Israeli Defence Forces of making false allegations against it. It says: On 17 November 2012 at 10.16pm, the Israeli Defense Forces tweeted from their official Twitter account (@IDFSpokesperson) a link to a video hosted on their official YouTube channel, featuring an animated film that depicts militants firing rockets from a school clearly marked with the UNRWA insignia. UNRWA is concerned about the creation and use of footage that wrongly suggests that UNRWA is allowing its premises to be used for terrorist activities in the current conflict and the unauthorised use of its logo in computer-generated material. In a situation of conflict these allegations have potentially grave consequences. UNRWA takes with utmost seriousness the neutrality of its installations, particularly in times of heightened violence. Five Israeli soldiers have been wounded by rocket fire from Gaza, the Israeli Defence Forces say. They have not given any further details. Here's a summary of events so far today: Diplomacy \u2022 Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, says he expects the \"farce of Israeli aggression\" to end today after negotiations in Cairo to end the conflict. He predicted positive results in the next few hours. Diplomats indicated the deal came after Hamas said it was prepared to delay discussions about ending the blockade of Gaza. \u2022 Hillary Clinton is en route to the Middle East to join efforts to broker a ceasefire in a move that suggests a breakthrough is close. She is due to hold talks in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Cairo, where she will meet the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, Palestinian officials and Egyptian leaders. \u2022 Russia has suggested that the US is blocking a UN security council statement condemning the escalating violence. The draft statement says: \"The members of the security council deplored the loss of civilian lives resulting from this escalation and emphasized that the civilian populations must be protected.\" But Russia foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says Russia and the US are backing Egypt's attempt to broker a truce. Israel/Gaza conflict \u2022 The Israeli Defence Forces said 51 of the 90 rockets fired from Gaza today, were intercepted. One rocket reached the outskirts of Jerusalem. The IDF said it targeted 100 sites in Gaza. \u2022 Up to seven people were killed in Israeli air raids on Gaza this morning. A hospital in Gaza city claimed 130 people have been killed since Israel began hitting targets in Gaza last week. Reporters witnessed an area near an ambulance station in Gaza being hit. \u2022 The UN human rights chief pressed Israel to avoid strikes on civilian structures in Gaza, and Unicef said children in the enclave were showing signs of severe trauma after direct hits on dwellings that have killed dozens of civilians. The International Committee of the Red Cross also reminded both sides of their obligation to comply with humanitarian law to minimise civilian casualties. \u2022 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Israel of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d towards Palestinians. AFP quoted him saying: \u201cIsrael is committing ethnic cleansing by ignoring peace in this region and violating international law. It is occupying the Palestinian territory step by step.\u201d \u2022 The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, has accused Arab governments of acting like sheep over the Gaza conflict and urged them to send arms to Hamas, Beirut's Daily Star reports. It quotes him saying: \u201cIsrael is betting that the resistance in Gaza will use all the rockets in its possession ... Arab countries should send arms to Gaza to enhance the resistance\u2019s chances in resisting the aggression rather than just act as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians.\" Syria \u2022 William Hague, says the UK is to recognise the newly formed Syrian opposition bloc as the \"sole legitimate representative of Syrian people\". Hague said it had showed a \"clear commitment to human rights and international humanitarian law, including the protection of religious communities and unfettered and safe access for humanitarian agencies\". Islamist rebels in Aleppo rejected the new coalition. \u2022 Rebels claim they have seized control of a military base in southern Damascus. They also raided a base near the Turkish border. \u2022 Turkey says it is close to securing a patriot missiles defence system. Foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu told a news conference: \"The official application will be completed as soon as possible. Intensive work is underway and the talks have reached the final stage. Senior Israeli officials say it will be possible to declare a ceasefire tonight with the arrival of Hillary Clinton, Israel Radio is reporting (via @AymanM). But at the same time Israel's foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman is warning that if there is a ground invasion , it won't be a limited one, AFP reports. The Guardian's Middle East editor, Ian Black, has written about Britain's recognition of the new Syrian opposition group, announced by William Hague: Britain has recognised the newly united Syrian opposition as the \"sole legitimate representative\" of the Syrian people and pledged new aid in the uprising against Bashar al-Assad. William Hague made the announcement in a statement to MPs. It marks a significant shift in British policy and follows a similar move by France last week. It also goes beyond a more cautious endorsement by the EU. The foreign secretary said he had sought and received \"important and encouraging\" assurances from the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces on agreeing a detailed political transition plan for Syria, as well as showing a \"clear commitment to human rights and international humanitarian law, including the protection of religious communities and unfettered and safe access for humanitarian agencies\". The National Coalition \"have much to do to win the full support of the Syrian people and coordinate opposition efforts more effectively,\" Hague said. \"But it is strongly in the interests of Syria, of the wider region, and of the United Kingdom that we support them and deny space to extremist groups,\" he added ... It will be invited to appoint a \"political representative\" \u2013 in effect an ambassador \u2013 to the UK. Britain is also to provide a \u00a31m package of communications support, \"which could for instance include mobile internet hubs and satellite phones to improve the coalition's ability to communicate inside Syria,\" Hague said. Britain is to \"urgently deploy\" a stabilisation response team to help the coalition meet people's basic needs in opposition-held areas, he said. The team will recommend areas for further UK assistance. The new package of UK support is worth around \u00a32m in immediate commitments which could be expanded \"considerably\" in the coming months. The foreign secretary said nothing about arming the rebels, but added that, in the absence of a political and diplomatic solution, \"we will not rule out any option in accordance with international law that might save innocent lives in Syria and prevent the destabilisation of a region that remains critical to the security of the United Kingdom and the peace of the whole world\". Despite the talk of an imminent truce, the two sides continue to exchange fire. The Israeli Defence Forces have been dropping leaflets before launching more air strikes on the east of the Gaza strip. Meanwhile, rockets continue to be fired from Gaza city. \"President Mohamed Morsi announced that the farce of Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip will end on Tuesday,\" Egyptian state news agency Mena said, quoting public remarks made by the country's head of state after the funeral of his sister. \"The efforts to conclude a truce between the Palestinian and Israeli sides will produce positive results in the next few hours,\" he was quoted as saying. The Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, says he expects Israeli \"aggression\" to end today, with talks with both sides on a truce yielding \"positive results\" in the next few hours, Reuters reports, citing the Egyptian state news agency, Mena. Diplomats are hopeful of temporary deal to end the fighting in Gaza but a long term solution looks remote, Peter Beaumont reports from the negotiations in Cairo. Those attending the talks anticipate there will be a lull in the hostilities, at the very least, he said in a telephone update. It would be unusual for a US secretary of state to travel to the region without the real prospect of a deal being done - usually such high level visits occur at the end of negotiations, Peter said. While people say they are cautiously optimistic there is plenty of room for risk. Hamas entered talks looking for an end to political assassinations and a lifting of the blockade against Gaza Diplomats told Peter that Hamas may be prepared to delay discussion about lifting the blockade as long as there are guarantees of future talks on the issue. And despite signs of progress the language of many involved has still be \u201cbellicose\u201d, Peter said. Mohamed Daif, the Hamas military commander, has given a given an aggressive statement claim his troops are ready to fight if there is ground invasion. While the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has accused Israel of genocide, he pointed out. The Economist has some interesting statistics on Gaza. Here is a taste: (the death toll since the start of the military operation is low as the figures were compiled as of as of 8am GMT yesterday): Number of Israelis killed by fire from Gaza between January 1st 2012 and November 11th 2012: 1 (Source: Wikipedia) Number of Palestinians in Gaza killed by Israeli fire during the same period: 78(Source: United Nations) Number of Israelis killed by fire from Gaza, November 13th-19th 2012: 3(Source: press reports) Number of Palestinians in Gaza killed by Israeli fire, November 13th-19th: 95 (Source: IDF) Number of those killed in Gaza under 15 years of age: 19 (Source) Total number of Israelis killed by rocket, mortar or anti-tank fire from Gaza since 2006: 47(Source: Wikipedia. This is disputed; another source says 26) Number of Palestinians in Gaza killed by Israeli fire from April 1st 2006 to July 21st 2012: 2,879(Source: United Nations) The rocket launched at Jerusalem from Gaza hit an open area outside a Palestinian village, close to Jerusalem, the Israeli Defence Forces say. The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, says the UK is to recognise the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary &amp; Opposition Forces as the \"sole legitimate representative of Syrian people\". The BBC's Jon Donnison recorded the sound of the rocket being fired towards Jerusalem. Police have said a rocket was fired towards Jerusalem but did not hit the city, Reuters reports. It was the second time a rocket has been launched toward Jerusalem since Israel's Gaza offensive began last Wednesday Israel's Channel 2 TV says a rocket landed in open area near Jerusalem, inflicting no casualties. This is probably what cause the rocket warning siren in Jerusalem. An explosion has been heard after rocket warning sirens were sounded in Jerusalem, Reuters reports. There was some bemusement when a rocket landed outside Jerusalem on Friday as the city is is home to the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site, and to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Palestinians envisage East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Once the rocket sirens are sounded in Ashkelon, Israelis have just 30 seconds to get to a bomb shelter or safe room, Harriet Sherwood reports from the coastal city. If they can\u2019t reach safety they are instructed to lay flat on the ground until the all-clear is given. But there have been no attacks on the city this morning and Israelis now have more confidence because of the success rate of the Iron Dome rocket defence system, she said. In an telephone update from Askhelon, Harriet said: It is very difficult for the residents here, but having spent four days in Gaza recently, there is no where near the same level of activity. Israelis are in love with the Iron Dome. They do feel that this is there great protector. This has concerned some people in authority because they fear that citizens will not take shelter in the ways they have been instructed because they feel Iron Dome is going to intercept the rockets and save them. It does have quite a good success rate so the confidence is not entirely misplaced. The sense of urgency among troops at the border has decreased in the last two days, Harriet added. Reservists are sitting around sipping cappuccinos and getting bored, she said. Residents in Ashkelon are anticipating some form of truce, Harriet said. The fact that Hillary Clinton is on her way to the region signifies that we are getting closer to a ceasefire. There has been rocket fire out of Gaza this morning, and the Israeli bombardment of Gaza is continuing although perhaps less intensely than for the last few days. I think there will be some kind of ceasefire or progress towards that. I don\u2019t think Clinton would be coming if she wasn\u2019t confident that there was something pretty bankable on the table. But obviously that can all go pretty badly wrong if there is a dramatic development in the next few hours. There is progress but I think it is still pretty much on a knife edge. The Israeli Defence Forces have told the BBC that 90 rockets have been fired from Gaza today, with 51 intercepted and 39 hitting Israel. They say the IDF have targeted 100 sites in Gaza today. Some of the rockets hit Beersheba, where the house below was struck. The IDF said that since Wednesday last week they have targeted 1,400 sites in Gaza. Israel has been targeted by approximately 1,200 rockets, 389 of which were intercepted, according to the IDF. Haaretz's Amira Hass writes that among the 34 Palestinians killed in Israel Defence Forces attacks in the past two days, just six have been confirmed as members of militant groups. The victims include \"farmers on their way to sell vegetables in the marketplace, vendors of purified drinking water and people who just happened to live too close to the targets of Israeli air strikes\". She writes that, since the start of the Israeli military operation, at least 58 civilians have been killed in Gaza, at least 18 of them children. Hass says the figures have been gathered by gathered by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, the al-Mezan Centre for Human Rights and medical sources in Gaza. She writes: At about 2am yesterday, the IAF (Israeli air force) fired warning rockets at an empty home in the Zeitun neighborhood. The building exploded about a minute later, trapping members of the neighboring Abu Zur family inside their home and killing a 5-year-old boy, Mahmad Iyad Fuad Abu Zur, along with two men and a woman: Ahad Hamdi Samil Katati, 38; Sahar Fadi Assad Abu Zur, 21; and Nasma Halmi Salam Abu Zur, also 21. Twenty-eight family members were injured in the attack and 20 homes were partly damaged. In addition to the nearly 100 Palestinians killed since Pillar of Defence began, some 700 Palestinians have been wounded in that time, including at least 215 children. An estimated 585 buildings have been damaged in the explosions, including 46 that were totally demolished, according to al-Mezan. In a rare audio recording, broadcast on Hamas TV, the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohamed Deif, has urged his troops to keep fighting and to prepare for a ground invasion. There was no mention of a ceasefire. Protests at a funeral in Hebron, in the West Bank, have turned violent, the BBC's Yolande Knell tweets. The funeral is for Hamdy Al-Fallah, 22, who was shot dead by Israeli troops while protesting against the military assault on Gaza. Medics told AFP Fallah was killed in an area where there no clashes were taking place between protesters and troops. Syrian rebels have stormed an air defence base near the Turkish border, Reuters reports citing opposition sources. The fighters had captured more than half the base at Sheikh Suleiman 20 miles northwest of Aleppo, and fighting was still taking place it said. \"The fighters have taken three artillery pieces and have entered most of the base. Fighter jets are flying over the area to try and force them out,\" said Abu Mujahed al-Halabi, an activist with the opposition Sham News Network. A rebel source said the fighters took large stocks of explosives from the site and will withdraw quickly to avoid the retaliatory air strikes that have blunted their advance across the country. Earlier rebels claimed to have seized a military base on the outskirts of Damascus. The Israeli Defence Forces say 120 trucks carrying food and aid were ready to enter Gaza today but Hamas began firing at the crossing. As a result, only 24 of the trucks entered before the crossing was closed, they say. Russia says it and the US are backing Egypt's attempt to broker a truce in Gaza. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov held talks with Hillary Clinton in Phnom Penh before she left for Jerusalem. Russia's foreign ministry tweeted: Palestinian blogger Shahd Abusalama has listed the names of all the people she says have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's military operation. In a tweet, she adds the name of 22 year-old Hamdy al-Fallah to the list. Another website, the Sabbah report, has a daily toll of Gazans it says have been killed by the Israeli military. The figure for today is put at five, including one child, although a BBC correspondent says at least seven have been killed in Gaza today. The Washington Post's Abigail Hauslohner says Red Crescent ambulance crews in Jabaliyah, north Gaza, have picked up three dead since 7am. Hauslohner is with the Global Post's Erin Cunningham and the pair say air strikes have landed close to the Red Crescent ambulance station, even though there are no militants there. The BBC's Wyre Davies reports that at least seven Gazans have been killed today \"including several civilians\". The Israeli Defence Forces say one of their soldiers was \"moderately wounded\" by a rocket attack this morning. They also say a bystander was injured when a rocket hit a car in Beersheba (see picture in 10.08am update). The Israel Defence Forces claim 37 rockets were fired from Gaza this morning. Spokesman Avital Lebovich tweeted this image claiming to show the damage caused by one rocket. Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades said they fired 15 rockets and a Fajr-5 projectile at at southern Israeli city Beersheba, Maan News agency reports. The Abu Ali Mustafa brigades said they also fired rockets at the city and Israeli tanks on the outskirts of Gaza. And the Ansar Brigades claimed they too fired rockets into Israel. Gaza is reported to be relatively quiet. The Guardian's Chris McGreal, who has just arrived, tweets: The resort to war in Gaza is dangerous in at least three ways, according to Britain's former foreign secretary David Miliband. In new blog post he notes the parallels between the current crisis and operation Cast Lead in 2008 when he was foreign secretary. One of the differences is that Miliband is now free to criticise Israel: The loss of life and property fuels hatred. The bombing marginalises the Palestinian Authority, and its president, who are Israel\u2019s notional negotiating partners. And it entrenches the separate legitimacy, authority and status of the \u201cGovernment of Hamas\u201d (apparently Ehud Barak used this phrase) in Gaza. It only makes sense if a two state solution is dead and buried. He added: \"Neither siege nor bombing is going to topple Hamas.\" A security guard at the US embassy in Tel Aviv has been stabbed by an intruder, Reuters reports citing Israeli police. The attacker, who was armed with a knife and an axe, has been arrested. A police spokesman said the said the guard opened fire during the attack. Israel Radio said the attacker was wounded. Turkey says it is close to securing a patriot missiles defence system, Reuters reports. Foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu told a news conference: The countries who supply Nato with Patriot systems are known, we have reached an agreement with those countries. The official application will be completed as soon as possible. Intensive work is underway and the talks have reached the final stage. The announcement came after clashes between Syrian rebels and Kurds in the border town Ras al-Ain. Al-Jazeera reports: Fleeing residents said the fighting was between the opposition Free Syrian Army and Kurds affiliated with the Democratic Union Party (PYD), a Syrian Kurdish party with links to Kurdish separatist fighters in Turkey. The UN secretary general has made a fresh call for truce as US officials confirm Hillary Clinton is on her way to Jerusalem. On his visit to Cairo, AP quotes Ban Ki-Moon as saying: \"This must stop, immediate steps are needed to avoid further escalation, including a ground operation.\" Ban met Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby and will meet with Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi before heading to Israel later in the day. A senior official has confirmed to Reuters that Clinton has left Cambodia and is heading for Jerusalem for talks on ending the crisis. The White House said Clinton was going to the Middle East for talks in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Cairo to try to calm the conflict. A delegation of nine Arab ministers, led by the Egyptian foreign minister, were due in Gaza later on Tuesday in a further signal of heightened Arab solidarity with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, the fighting continues: Hamas militants said they fired 16 missiles at the southern Israeli city of Beersheba after Israel's military targeted roughly 100 sites in Gaza overnight, including ammunition stores and the Gaza headquarters of the National Islamic Bank. Some 110 Palestinians have died in a week of fighting, the majority of them civilians, including 27 children. Three Israelis died last week when a Gaza missile struck their house. Welcome to Middle East Live. Diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire are intensifying as both US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon are due for talks in Jerusalem. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: Gaza/Israel \u2022 US secretary of state Hillary Clinton is expected to fly to Israel on Tuesday for talks with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, Reuters reports. \"Secretary of state Hillary Clinton will arrive this evening and meet with Netanyahu tomorrow,\" a source said. \u2022 Israeli aircraft have hit the headquarters of a bank in Gaza set up by Hamas to sidestep international sanctions, AP reports. The inside of the Islamic National Bank in Gaza City, and a building supply business in the basement was damaged. \u2022 Efforts to agree a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians are to intensify, with the UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, weighing in amid guarded optimism that a deal is possible because it suits both sides to end the fighting. Negotiations in Cairo focused on securing a package that would allow both warring parties to claim some kind of victory. Ban arrived in Cairo amid growing international concern that the crisis could escalate and spread. The UN secretary-general will visit Jerusalem for talks with Netanyahu on Tuesday, before heading to the West Bank town of Ramallah to see the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Barack Obama phoned leaders in the Middle East to push ceasefire on Monday night as the US navy was reported to be deploying three ships to the eastern Mediterranean in case American citizens had to be evacuated from Israel. \u2022 After a cabinet meeting last night Israel indicated it would prefer to find a diplomatic solution rather than launching a widely-feared ground invasion. A senior Israeli official told Reuters: \"Before deciding on a ground invasion, the prime minister intends to exhaust the diplomatic move in order to see if a long-term ceasefire can be achieved.\" But he added: \"If diplomacy fails, we may well have no alternative but to send in ground forces.\" \u2022 Both sides in the negotiations want to be able to point to something tangible from the blood-letting, writes Ian Black. Hamas wants a guarantee from Israel that it would end \"targeted assassinations\" of the kind that killed Ahmed al-Jaabari last Wednesday. It would also need pledges about opening crossing points into Egypt and Israel \u2013 effectively lifting the five year blockade. Israel is insisting at a minimum on stopping the cross-border rocket fire which has united public opinion behind Operation Defensive Pillar. Israeli casualties have been low because the weapons are inaccurate and many of them were quickly destroyed. \u2022 Russia has suggested that the US is blocking a UN security council statement condemning the escalating violence. The draft statement says: \"The members of the Security Council deplored the loss of civilian lives resulting from this escalation and emphasized that the civilian populations must be protected.\" \u2022 Israel has denied that it has used disproportionate force in a conflict that has killed more than 100 Palestinians and three Israelis. Writing in the Guardian deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon said Israel will not allow its citizens' lives to be endangered. He wrote: Israel has successfully targeted in excess of 1,300 weapons caches, rocket launchers and other elements of Hamas's terrorist infrastructure. Yet despite this, the number of Palestinian casualties remains around one for every 13 strikes, the majority killed being active members of Hamas and combatants. \u2022 The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, has accused Arab governments of acting like sheep over the Gaza conflict and urged them to send arms to Hamas, Beirut's Daily Star reports. It quotes him saying: \u201cIsrael is betting that the resistance in Gaza will use all the rockets in its possession ... Arab countries should send arms to Gaza to enhance the resistance\u2019s chances in resisting the aggression rather than just act as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians.\" Syria \u2022 Islamist rebel groups in Aleppo say they reject the new Western-backed opposition coalition as the UK appears poised to grant it full recognition, the BBC reports. In an internet video one of the groups denounced what they called \"the conspiratorial project\" and said they intend to establish an \"Islamist state\" in Syria. \u2022 Syrian rebels said they had seized the headquarters of an army battalion near the southern gate of Damascus on Monday, the nearest military base to the capital reported to have fallen to opposition fighters in a 20-month revolt. The Islamist rebel groups Ansar al-Islam and Jund Allah Brigades said in a statement that they had taken the Air Defence Battalion base near Hajar al-Aswad after four days of fighting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
