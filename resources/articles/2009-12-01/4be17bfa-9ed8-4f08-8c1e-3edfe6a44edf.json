The precise limit of its jurisdiction has not yet been fully defined, particularly to the west of the United Arab Emirates, where there is only a partial continental shelf boundary between the two states. Its claimed territorial sea limit around Abu Musa and Tunbs islands close to Oman is contested by the UAE, which has a longstanding claim to sovereignty over them. But vessels from any state also have rights. Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a ship that is not \"prejudicial to the peace, good order or security\" of a coastal state, is allowed \"innocent passage\" through the territorial sea which may extend up to 12 nautical miles from a state's baselines. Although Iran is not a party to UNCLOS, it recognises the principle of innocent passage. Vessels also have freedom of navigation, although Iran has regulatory rights over an area adjacent to the territorial sea, to prevent and punish infringement of \"customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary\" laws. It can also establish \"safety zones\" around oil installations in the exclusive economic zone in which navigation can be regulated. The most likely source of the dispute in this instance, according to experts, is if the yacht Kingdom of Bahrain strayed close to the island of Sirri, west of Abu Musa and Tunbs, where there are oil installations. Martin Pratt, at the International Boundaries Research Unit at Durham University, said: \"There are a few oil installations to the south of Sirri and states are allowed to establish safety zones around them. While the principle of innocent passage is part of international law, there are bits and pieces of law that allows states to protect their boundaries. If Iran has established safety zones around Sirri and this ship was drifting into one of these, then you can understand why an Iranian patrol boat could have gone to have a look.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
