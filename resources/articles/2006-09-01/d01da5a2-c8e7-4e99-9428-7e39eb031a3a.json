Take a couple of those with a hangover and you soon descend into a kind of warm, dark haze. But why, I ask him, those ones in particular, not just aspirins, or Anadin Extra, or ... I hesitate to use the N-word. 'Nurofen? They're probably all the same, really. I just liked Solpadeine best.' Little did he know that in later years Solpadeine would so richly repay his brand loyalty. For having abandoned his job he became an artist, and two years later held his first show, last Wednesday at the Madder Rose gallery near London's Old Street (guests included artists Marc Quinn, Harland Miller and Gavin Turk, and actor Ian Holm); and Solpadeine loomed large. Literally. 'The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill,' as George Clinton used to say. Of the 18 works on show, at least 10 are Solpadeine-inspired or Solpadeine-related. And they're all lovely: exploring the line where reality and perception blend, fade, fizzle quietly and pass into darkness. Photographs do them no justice, for - using mirrors, magnets, secret substances and conjuring tricks of the kind that would delight any eight-year-old - they do lots of optical things that seem impossible. The non-Solpadeine-related artworks are also remarkable, including a piece made for a dead friend whose image comes to ghostly life when a small mirror is breathed on; and a piece for a dead father, Milton Shulman, the drama critic, made using his ashes in stratified, magnetised, colour-coded layers; and one in video, with the sun setting ... as a Solpadeine tablet dissolves fizzingly into a glass of water. Come on, Jason. Why Solpadeine? 'They're the ones that just about give you the strength to get out of the bath in the morning. I'm not really religious but I wanted to say thank you.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
