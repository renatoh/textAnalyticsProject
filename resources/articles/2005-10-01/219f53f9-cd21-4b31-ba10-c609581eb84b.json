Diane Jones, 21, Shauna, two, and 13-month-old Sarah died in October 1995 when petrol was poured under the door of their house in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, and set alight. Two women found guilty of arson with intent to endanger life had their convictions overturned in 1999. Officers want to hear from two people who made anonymous calls to police at the time of the crime and others who have written anonymous letters claiming they know what happened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
