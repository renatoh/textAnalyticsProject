Comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that \"economic activity appears to be levelling out\", upbeat business surveys in the UK and rising commodity prices helped the FTSE 100 rally for the fifth straight session, closing at the highest level in almost a year. The blue-chip index rose 45.3 points, or 0.9%, to 4,896.2, having pushed through the 4,900 mark at one point during the day. The move higher mirrored gains around the world as traders brushed aside fears about the robustness of any recovery, acting instead on fears of missing out on any further equity rally. David Buik at City broker BGC Partners said he could not see \"anything to stop the FTSE 100 getting very close to 5000 by the end of this week\". The market still has a way to go, however, to return to the levels seen before last September's collapse of Lehman Brothers. The FTSE 100 was at 5,416.7 on the eve of the bank's downfall. With risky assets in favour yesterday, banks provided much of the momentum. Lloyds was up more than 6% at 107.97p on hopes it could sell its Clerical Medical unit. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 3.3p, or 6.8%, to 51.75p, above the 50.5p average price at which the government bought shares. The Lloyds price has to reach 122.6p before that stake goes into the black. The familiar tale of recovery hopes boosting the outlook for metals raised copper prices again and miners were on the way up. Kazakhmys rose 5.8% to 980p, ENRC was up 5.3% to 896.5p and Rio Tinto gained 4.9% to \u00a325.14. Security specialist G4S \u2013 the FTSE 100's largest employer \u2013 was the biggest faller of the day as the market realised it had got a little too far ahead of itself before the company's results. G4S, which provides security services for companies and governments, said it managed double-digit profit growth despite the downturn. Its shares had risen 4.9% over last week and yesterday they dropped 3.5%, or 7.9p, to 216.2p. Petrofac also headed lower despite reporting rising profits. Profit-taking left shares in the oil and gas services firm down 7p at 906.5p. katie.allen@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
