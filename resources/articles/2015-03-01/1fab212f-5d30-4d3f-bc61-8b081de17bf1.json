The City manager did not deny the pair had a heated exchange at Anfield, but said it was normal and quickly forgotten. \u201cThere is not any problem within the dressing room,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt is normal to have a discussion if two players think differently but this happened two weeks ago. If you were telling me this happened yesterday I might be concerned but it is in the past and it was nothing in the first place.\u201d City are unlikely to underestimate Burnley when they visit Turf Moor on Saturday evening. When Sean Dyche\u2019s side came to the Etihad at Christmas they went two goals behind then fought back for a 2-2 draw. That brought City\u2019s seven-match winning run in the league to an end and some would argue the defending champions have not been the same since. They are now five points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand, with little room for further slip-ups. \u201cWe know Burnley are a very good team,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cAnd we also know that it is a big mistake to think the game is over if you are winning 2-0. We have two away games in the next few days and neither will be easy.\u201d Barcelona are City\u2019s opponents on Wednesday in the Champions League. Pellegrini\u2019s side have a 2-1 deficit to make up from the first leg, though the manager does not feel a late kick-off the previous Saturday will be a factor. \u201cI don\u2019t think a few hours will make an important difference, the main thing is we play Saturday and Wednesday,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a lot better than Saturday to Tuesday. Sometimes you feel the league could do more to help teams playing in Europe, but I don\u2019t think that is the biggest difficulty English teams face. More important in my opinion is the number of games English teams have to play in December and January. I am not talking about Boxing Day, I know we need to keep that, but playing so often in the winter months leaves you tired.\u201d With Chelsea in the driving seat in the Premier League and City showing no signs of overcoming their inferiority complex against Barcelona, speculation is rife that this may be Pellegrini\u2019s last season in Manchester and he is already being linked with the position Rafa Ben\u00edtez will shortly vacate at Napoli. The manager denied a trophyless season would automatically mean the exit door. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be all about whether we win the league title,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as I am concerned I am here until June 2016 and I intend to finish my contract. I am happy here, I don\u2019t have any problems, and I always try to complete my contracts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
