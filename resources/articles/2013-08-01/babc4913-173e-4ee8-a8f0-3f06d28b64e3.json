However, none of their FA Youth Cup-winning team from last season made the starting line-up against Everton on Saturday. Norwich 6: Ruddy, Turner, E Bennett, Howson, Johnson, Redmond Southampton 6: Shaw, Chambers, Lallana, Ward-Prowse, Lambert, Rodriguez Aston Villa 5: Lowton, Baker, Westwood, Delph, Agbonlahor Cardiff 5: Caulker, Turner, Whittingham, Campbell, Connolly Man Utd 5: Ferdinand, Jones, Carrick, Cleverley, Welbeck Arsenal 4: Gibbs, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere, Walcott Chelsea 4: Terry, Lampard, Cole, Cahill Crystal Palace 4: Ward, Moxey, Gayle, Wilbraham Everton 4: Baines, Jagielka, Barkley, Osman Liverpool 4: Johnson, Gerrard, Henderson, Sturridge Swansea 4: Britton, Dyer, Routledge, Shelvey Tottenham 4: Rose, Dawson, Walker, Lennon West Ham 4: Noble, Nolan, Cole, Jarvis Hull 3: Graham, Davies, Chester Stoke 3: Shawcross, Etherington, Crouch West Bromwich Albion 3: Foster, Jones, Ridgewell Fulham 2: Richardson, Sidwell Man City 2: Hart, Lescott Sunderland 2: Colback, Johnson Newcastle 1: Taylor 36, or 49%, of these 74 have played for England Only 10 out of the 220 players, or 4.5%, were English and aged 21 or under, three of them being 18-year-olds at Southampton \u2013 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ross Barkley, Steven Caulker, Calum Chambers, Phil Jones, Nathan Redmond, Luke Shaw, Jonjo Shelvey, James Ward-Prowse and Jack Wilshere. Only three of the 23-man England Under-21 squad that beat Scotland 6-0 started on the opening weekend \u2013 Barkley, Shelvey and Redmond (Butland, Stones, Robinson, Chalobah, Wisdom, Thorpe, Keane, Sterling, Ameobi, Hughes, Dier, Wickham, Kane, Carroll, Lingard, Johnstone, Garbutt, Long, Bond, Berahino were the ones who did not). TRANSFERS \u00a3415.67m has been spent by Premier League clubs in the summer transfer window on 61 players. Only \u00a357.213m (13.8%) of this has been spent on 12 (19.7%) English players \u2013 Shelvey, Carroll, Downing, Redmond, (Gary) Hooper, Bent, (John) Brayford, (Simon) Moore, Caulker, (Curtis) Davies, Huddlestone, (Dwight) Gayle. None of the top eight clubs from last season's Premier League table (Man Utd down to West Brom) have signed an English player for a transfer fee in this summer's window. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2013. The original said Southampton had only 5 English players and that the percentage of English players in the Premier League for the 2013/14 season was 33.6%. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
