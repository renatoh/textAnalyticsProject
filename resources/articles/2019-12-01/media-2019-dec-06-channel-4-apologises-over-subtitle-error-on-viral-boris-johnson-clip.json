In a clip of the prime minister uploaded to Channel 4\u2019s social media accounts, Johnson was captioned as saying: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of having people of colour come to this country but I think we should have it democratically controlled and have it done that way.\u201d In reality, Johnson said he was in favour of having \u201cpeople of talent\u201d come to the UK, and did not discuss race. The falsely subtitled clip went viral on Friday, prompting Channel 4 to issue a correction: \u201cBoris Johnson says \u2018people of talent\u2019 not \u2018people of colour\u2019. Our earlier tweet was a mistake. We misheard and we apologise.\u201d Some people who had shared the clip continued to wrongly insist the prime minister had said the word \u201ccolour\u201d. This suggested it may be an example of people\u2019s hearing being influenced by visual cues \u2013 similar to the known phenomenon of the McGurk effect. It also echoes the confusion at the end of last year over whether a voice in a short audio clip was saying the word \u201claurel\u201d or \u201cyanny\u201d. While the Conservatives did not comment officially, a Tory source doubled down in the party\u2019s battle with Channel 4, in which the Tories have already threatened the broadcaster with changes to its public service remit. The party also unsuccessfully complained to the media regulator, Ofcom, about the broadcaster\u2019s decision to replace the prime minister with a block of ice, while continuing to express fury at Channel 4\u2019s head of current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, for calling the prime minister a liar. The anonymous senior Conservative source said: \u201cThis shows why it has been impossible to cooperate with Channel 4 News. They are campaigners in this election, inventing the most damaging things possible to further their campaign against Brexit.\u201d The individual went on to criticise the entire media system, with the Conservative party having already indicated it has little interest in subjecting Johnson to a one-on-one interview with Andrew Neil because the party believes the interview format is outdated. \u201cThis sort of thing is why so many media organisations have collapsing audiences. We sadly do not expect the senior management at Channel 4 to take this terrible mistake seriously and we expect more of the same,\u201d they said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
