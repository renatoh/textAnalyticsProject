But for all the wrong reasons. Renowned as a haunt of prostitutes and pimps, and ravaged by hard drugs, the sprawling slab of central London is a byword for urban nightmare. But all that is about to change. Billions of pounds of investment are set to pour into the area in one of Europe's biggest regeneration schemes. Instead of crack houses, there will be gastro pubs. Architects and office workers will replace drug pushers and prostitutes. New railways will link the area directly to Europe. King's Cross will change from no-go area to one of London's most sought after addresses. Or, at least, that's the plan. The blueprint for the spectacular overhaul of a vast tract of railway land behind King's Cross station promises to create a thriving commercial area full of offices, workshops, galleries, restaurants, bars and clubs together with up to 2,500 modern new homes. The catalyst will be the opening in 2007 of the \u00a35.5 billion Channel Tunnel rail link to St Pancras. Remarkably, London &amp; Continental railways say rail building work is running to schedule. The revamped area is expected to contrast dramatically with the seedy underworld popularised in the 1986 film Mona Lisa, starring Cathy Tyson as Simone, a King's Cross call girl. When it is complete the area will be the largest transport hub in Europe, with a journey time of two hours 20 minutes to Paris and two hours to Brussels. It is projected 25 million people a year will come through the area. 'The change in London's property market will be huge,' said Peter Bishop, Camden council's director of environment. 'Potentially this is going to have a bigger impact than Canary Wharf.' Early plans by developer Argent St George show a 58.5-acre area that will host 8 million square feet of development at a construction cost of \u00a32bn. It will be worth \u00a33bn when completed. Phased construction will take 15 years, and about 50 new streets could be created. But sceptics have seen it all before. As one local policeman said: 'The Cross is as bad as it's ever been.' History has rarely been kind to the area. In the early nineteenth century it was known chiefly for a huge heap of ash dumped there by a local brickworks. The railways arrived in 1851, bringing a kind of prosperity as thousands of workers moved into the area. But it also brought a crowded urban landscape of smoke, rail sidings, coal depots and train engines. In the 1950s, as the car became king and railway workers were laid off, true decline set in. It was decided to tarmac over King's Cross to make way for a six-lane motorway. Those plans were scrapped. Then architect Sir Norman Foster came up with a grand 6m sq ft office scheme. But it became a victim of the early Nineties property crash. Una Sapietis, of the King's Cross Railway Lands Group, which represents the local community, is worried that these latest plans may ignore the people who call the area home. 'The local population has borne the brunt of the schemes for national benefit, which don't consider our needs,' she said. Undoubtedly there will be battles ahead over the amount of affordable homes planned and respect for residents' rights. The heritage lobby too will fight the demolition of any of the listed buildings that dot the area. But at the moment it is so far, so good. Argent's plans have the tentative backing of the local Camden council and London's mayor, Ken Livingston, ahead of a formal planning application early next year. Argent chief executive, Roger Madelin says he has already received 20 approaches from potential backers all over the world. Madelin, 43, sees the redevelopment of King's Cross as a unique opportunity. 'Few people have done something this big before,' he said. 'We've got a once in a century opportunity to masterplan and develop 58 acres in central London.' Madelin's vision will see many of the listed buildings, which form part of this country's industrial heritage, retained. The three enormous round gasometers of the King's Cross gasworks will be moved to the nearby canal and could be used for spectacular apartments. Madelin wants one of them to be turned into an art gallery akin to New York's Guggenheim. Yet King's Cross has defeated many before. It has a long record of dealing harshly with intruders. Legend has it that it was here Boadicea drove away her Roman enemies. More recently it finished the career of Sir Allan Green, the former director of public prosecutions, who was caught kerb crawling there. If this latest and largest attempt to reclaim the area fails, it might be the end of the road. 'If this doesn't work there's a powerful argument for grassing over the entire site,' said Tony Travers, a leading urban expert at the London School of Economics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
