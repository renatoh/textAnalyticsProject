Mr Maillot was installed just 11 months ago in a coup by small shareholders, who voted down the firm's British-led management in favour of a French board. The struggling Channel tunnel operator said Mr Maillot would be replaced as a non-executive director by Henri Rouanet, a former prefect of the Picardie region. Eurotunnel's board has been beset by infighting over how to tackle its \u00a36bn debt. It has admitted it may be unable to meet repayments due beyond the end of this year. It emerged this week that the company's auditors have yet to sign off its annual results, due to be published last month, amid doubts over whether the firm was a \"going concern\". Eurotunnel said Mr Maillot would remain available to assist \"in any way necessary\" in its efforts to tackle its debt problems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
