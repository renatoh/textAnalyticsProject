Six months after his defeat by Roy Jones, Woods cemented his place among the division's leading exponents by outclassing the 34-year-old Rivera. He dominated the opening round behind a busy left jab and backed the Mexican on to the ropes late on with a good left uppercut but the stocky Rivera ducked and dived to reach the bell without ever looking in real trouble. The end, when it came, was a little premature. Rivera found himself caught against the ropes, again taking punishment from the taller Woods, but it came as a surprise to most in the sell-out crowd when the referee Jeff Hinds dived in to call a halt with only 49 seconds of the second round gone. Only seven weeks after making the European bantamweight title his own, Castleford's Noel Wilders made a successful, if somewhat unsatisfactory, first defence. He held on to his title courtesy of a technical draw with the Frenchman Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Patrac after an accidental clash of heads in the fourth round that left him with a badly gashed left eyebrow. The 28-year-old southpaw Wilders began steadily in a scrappy opener but returned to his corner at the end of the round with a small cut at the side of his left eye, picked up during one of countless clashes of heads. The second round improved only fractionally as both men were warned to watch their heads when this time the Frenchman picked up the nick over his left eye. Wilders did take a standing count in the second but was a little unlucky because he appeared to go down after a slip. The home favourite began to find his range in the third as a series of quickfire in-out combinations forced Patrac on to the back foot but the end came 1min 41sec into the fourth round when yet another clash of heads left Wilders nursing a nasty gash to his right eyebrow which, after a doctor's inspection, was deemed enough to halt the contest. Edinburgh's Alex Arthur, meanwhile, claims his supporters are being cheated because his manager Frank Maloney refuses to allow him to fight in the Scottish capital. The British super-featherweight champion will once again fight on Scott Harrison's undercard at the Braehead Centre near Glasgow on Sat urday night when the WBO featherweight champion makes his first title defence against Wayne McCullough. Arthur, who will take on Patrick Malinga for the vacant WBA international super-featherweight title, said: \"I've been putting the pressure on Frank because a fight in Edinburgh is long overdue now. The people deserve it and I feel they're getting a wee bit cheated.\" PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
