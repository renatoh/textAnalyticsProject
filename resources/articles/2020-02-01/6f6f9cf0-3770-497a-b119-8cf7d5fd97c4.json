I was surprised when Alan Shearer got in touch, for instance, if I can give just one illustration of support from someone who doesn\u2019t even know me. He told me he had recovered from something similar that had also happened at Goodison.\u201d Gomes was contacted in the immediate aftermath of the accident in a game against Tottenham in November not only by Son Heung-min, who held himself responsible, but also by Serge Aurier and Eric Dier. \u201cAll the Spurs players were really nice to me. Son just wanted to apologise but I explained to him that sometimes things like this happen, and obviously he hadn\u2019t done it on purpose. If I had thought anyone had done it on purpose it would have made the situation even worse.\u201d Coming on for the last half-hour against Arsenal last Sunday and immediately improving the Everton side, Gomes is playing again after 112 days out. Many imagined he would not be seen again this season with an injury that needed repair to bone and ligament, but the speed of his recovery is a testament to the quick thinking of John Hollingsworth, the Everton club doctor, and his own hard work. \u201cThe doctor was unbelievable,\u201d Gomes says. \u201cHe put my ankle in the right place out there on the pitch, he was really fast. I knew what he wanted to do and I rejected the oxygen because with the adrenalin I was mad, I was angry. He rotated my ankle twice, which I can tell you was painful. I was screaming and I could see people in the stand holding their hands to their faces and telling their kids not to look. I think I actually punched Lu\u00eds Boa Morte [then Everton assistant coach] at some point because he was standing nearby.\u201d The reason Gomes saw all the faces in the nearby stand was because the last thing he wanted to look at was his injury. \u201cI knew my ankle was pointing in the wrong direction and I didn\u2019t want that image haunting me for the rest of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cTo this day I have refused to watch the videos or look at any of the pictures. I was already in pain before I fell, before Aurier tried to get the ball again. \u201cI knew instantly that something was badly wrong and I just tried to avoid everything. I\u2019m glad I did that, because you rerun the whole incident in your mind hundreds of times afterwards; you can\u2019t help it. You keep thinking: \u2018Why me?\u2019 Or: \u2018I might have been all right if I had done something differently.\u2019 It\u2019s like a flashback that won\u2019t stop happening, so I really don\u2019t need the picture of my foot in my memory.\u201d Gomes went back to his native Portugal in December and January, training and doing hours of rehabilitation every day apart from Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cBasically all I did for two months was work, gym work, bike work, work in the pool and mobility work morning, afternoon and night,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d take little breaks for food and then I would rest and sleep. I\u2019m not going to lie, I had some bad moments during that period, but it was all worth it when I came back and started again with the team. \u201cSeeing the light at the end of the tunnel made me incredibly happy, even if I had to tell everyone in training to go in as hard as they normally would and stop going easy on me. Playing at Arsenal was good for my confidence too, because after an injury like this you never quite know whether you will be the same player again. When I was out I found it hard to even follow football on television. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t watch an entire game, but now I feel comfortable again and the manager has said I can take things at my own pace.\u201d Gomes was sorry not to be able to say goodbye to Marco Silva, though the pair have spoken since the former manager\u2019s dismissal in December, but like most Evertonians was impressed at the calibre of his replacement. \u201cI was sad for Marco because we felt he had been really unfortunate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut obviously football is about results as well and we didn\u2019t have those. Carlo Ancelotti is a really smart guy with a lot of experience as a player and a manager and he is helping us, our results have improved. I am happy to have had the chance to work with both of them and I think Carlo is building on what Marco started.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
