Shame, then, that the singing is not more special. There is plenty to admire here \u2013 particularly Mark William's handling of four Howard Skempton anthems and Edward Bairstow's masterly miniature, I Sat Down Under His Shadow \u2013 but the interpretations are in the main workmanlike rather than wondrous. And while it's difficult to resist SS Wesley's triumphant Blessed Be the God and Father, with its glorious treble solo, it seems a bit of a cheat to include it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
