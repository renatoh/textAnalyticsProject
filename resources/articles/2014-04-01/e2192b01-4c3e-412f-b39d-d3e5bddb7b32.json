The list of great Easter-related films is short, and the list of those available online considerably shorter. Happily, iTunes recently identified an exception by adding Pier Paolo Pasolini's rapturous The Gospel According to St. Matthew to their download roster \u2013 and you could not ask for a more bracing antidote to the hoary biblical epics that TV programmers routinely trot out over this particular weekend. Not at all the reading one might expect from the bristly gay Marxist, this spare, serene observation of Jesus Christ's trajectory from birth to death to, well, beyond instead surprises with its devotion to the text, making its stray flourishes of subversion \u2013 notably the bluesy surge of Odetta's Motherless Child on the soundtrack \u2013 hit that much harder. Fifty years old this year and pristine as ever, it's a film about belief for viewers of all persuasions. Working from slightly less sacred source material, that's very much what Ben Stiller's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (Fox, 12) would like to be. Redesigning the 1947 Danny Kaye comedy (itself fairly far removed from James Thurber's satirical short story) into a very 21st-century paean to self-actualisation, it's a film that goes to impressive technical lengths to make pamphlet-sized points: chase your dreams, only connect, and so on and so forth. Stiller plays the eponymous fantasist \u2013 oddly, a photo editor at the long-defunct Life magazine \u2013 as a kind of guarded Forrest Gump figure, living out the spirit of his publication through elaborate, CGI-heavy flights of fancy. It's handsome, agreeably earnest and ephemeral as a daydream. It's hard to say whether Allen Ginsberg would have been sneerier about the tidy liberation sentiments of Mitty or Kill Your Darlings (Universal, 15), John Krokidas's diverting but oddly puppyish portrait of the Beat poet's Columbia University days. Daniel Radcliffe is eager, if uncomfortably cast, as the naive English student finding his sexuality and creative voice via an unrequited crush on destructive fellow student Lucien Carr \u2013 played by Dane DeHaan with an amped-up vigour and eroticism the film could use more of. The man wears the hell out of a herringbone coat, too \u2013 it may be the most covetably styled anti-establishment movie in memory. The sad death last year of impeccably sculpted Fast &amp; Furious star Paul Walker hasn't stirred quite enough morbid sentiment to grant unapologetically lurid B-movie trifecta Hustlers (Lionsgate, 18) a cinema release, but it has pushed him to the fore in the film's marketing campaign. Luckily enough, his go-for-broke gonzo performance \u2013 as a meth-head embroiled in a botched heist \u2013 is one of the best things Wayne Kramer's strung-out collection of deep south underworld stories (released in the US as Pa wn Shop Chronicles) has going for it. As restful and gently rippled as Hustlers is manic, Eric Steel's documentary Kiss the Water (Soda, E) is quite the best cinematic study of fly-fishing since Robert Redford's feature A River Runs Through It. It's also the only one, but that's not to deny its modest loveliness: a fond portrait of eccentric Scottish fly designer Megan Boyd, coated in misty-silver landscape photography, it's a film that exudes its own kind of non-denominational spirituality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
