Thank you for your company and contributions. A summary follows of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 situation on the evening of Good Friday 2020. This long weekend, stay home, stay well, save lives. Australia\u2019s new infection rate continues to slow The commonwealth deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, says that \u201cthe curve is definitely decreasing\u201d, the result of the border closures of a little over a fortnight ago and the social distancing measures enacted. I would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. A total of 6,203 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Australia, and there have been 54 deaths. New South Wales remains the state hardest hit, and Sydney in particular. NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, accepted his resignation. Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return A day after the NRL revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May, the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had not been consulted on the league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time, while the commonwealth deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon. Australians warned not to travel over Easter State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel over the Easter holidays, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those breaching social distancing laws by travelling. Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The state\u2019s chief medical officer posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling from a specific part of the country. Chef Pete Evans\u2019 recipe to treat Covid condemned Peak medical groups have criticised the Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans for suggesting that a $15,000 \u201csubtle energy platform\u201d could be used to treat coronavirus, saying such claims are baseless, ill-informed and dangerous. Evans, a television host and paleo diet enthusiast who has previously promoted anti-vaccination ideas, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u2013 dismissed by the Australian Medical Association as a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d \u2013 for $14,990 on his website. Evans\u2019 ad said the machine was a \u201csubtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d. Covid-19 has so far infected more than 1.6 million people globally and killed 95,000. It has ground economies to a halt all over the world and has the potential to force hundreds of millions into poverty. There is no evidence that it can be treated or cured by coloured lights. Hard-pressed GPs face rent reduction requests from pathology giants GP practices are under pressure to accept a 50% reduction in rental payments from major pathology corporations. It follows news that doctor-owned general practices are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses from Covid-19. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has accepted the resignation of her arts minister, Don Harwin, after he was fined $1,000 for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. While Harwin maintained he had sought, and followed, official advice on whether he was allowed to relocate to his holiday home, he accepted the controversy surrounding his move \u2013 as the government was urging people to stay home over Easter \u2013 was a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Berejiklian accepted Harwin\u2019s resignation, issuing a statement: During this health crisis my government has asked the community to make greater sacrifices than all of us have ever had to make before. These sacrifices are saving lives, and I am proud of the people of NSW for continuing to uphold the law in the interest of public health. Late last night I was advised minister Don Harwin had been fined $1,000 for breaching a public health order. The police, who have been tasked by my government with enforcing these health orders, came to the conclusion that minister Harwin breached the order. Whilst minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in place apply equally to everybody. Accordingly, minister Harwin has appropriately resigned from cabinet. Internationally now ... aerial footage shows a mass grave being dug on New York\u2019s Hart Island to deal with the surge in deaths caused by the coronavirus. A warning: this video contains sensitive material. As New York deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the length of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in its public cemetery on Hart Island. Aerial video captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip near the Bronx. Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can\u2019t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Operations have now increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day. NSW arts minister Don Harwin has resigned from the government after he was fined $1,000 by police for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. As governments around Australia were urging their citizens to stay home over Easter, Harwin was spotted earlier in the week at his Pearl Beach house, more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. Harwin maintained he sought formal advice that his living arrangements complied with the direction for people to stay at home, and that he acted in accordance with those orders. But he says the controversy over his getaway was a \u201cdistraction\u201d for the government at a critical time. He has offered his resignation to the premier. His statement in full: Today I have offered my resignation to the premier as a minister in her government. There is nothing more important than the work of the government in fighting the coronavirus crisis. I will not allow my circumstances to be a distraction from that work and I very much regret that my residential arrangements have become an issue during this time. At all times I have sought to act in accordance with public health orders and I sought advice that my living arrangements complied with those orders. I remain confident that I have acted in accordance with those orders. I know however that perception is just as important during these times. The premier and her team are doing an outstanding job during the biggest crisis our state and nation have faced during our lifetimes. It is absolutely vital they should be able to focus entirely on the health and economic issues facing our community. It\u2019s had a very good run today, but worthy of repeating. Game of Bones: And while the focus has been on Sydney, the NSW government is seeking to roll out rapid testing for Covid-19 in regional areas to reduce waiting times. So far, 70% of tests in NSW have been in Sydney, which has identified clusters in the capital. But if you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t find \u2026 Again, our beloved friends at AAP: Regional NSW towns will soon have access to rapid coronavirus testing, meaning samples won\u2019t have to be sent to Sydney for analysis. Broken Hill health workers will over Easter repurpose a machine used to rapidly test flu samples so it can detect the novel coronavirus. It should be operational by Monday and more regional areas will follow as specific hardware is imported. \u201cThat is really important, particularly for the more distant sites,\u201d the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said on Friday. \u201cHaving that point-of-care testing, or testing that comes back in about an hour, is very useful because it gives us more rapid identification of cases.\u201d St Vincent\u2019s hospital is already using its repurposed GeneXpert machine in its emergency department and will also begin trialling another molecular test in the coming days. Of the 137,000 people tested for coronavirus in NSW since January, 70% have been in Sydney or on the Central Coast. Just 322 people in far western NSW have been tested while northern NSW and the Murrumbidgee are the two regions were there have been fewer than one test per 1,000 residents. Those three regions account for 100 positive cases. Chant defended the current turnaround time for testing \u2013 which can see results for Sydney-based cases returned within 24 hours. \u201cThe issue for rural and remote areas is the time it takes for specimens to come down to Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we get more [novel coronavirus] cartridges for our GeneXperts, we will be looking at deploying this test across various sites. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a mind to supporting rural and regional communities so we can give them access to the testing that is much more prompt in the metropolitan area.\u201d NSW is the state with the most Covid-19 infections in the country. (It should be noted that, by international standards, Australia and NZ have very low numbers of cases, low rates of community transmission, and low death rates. See here from Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin and some other reporter: But there is an interesting breakdown of cases in NSW, provided by NSW Health. In the 24 hours to 8pm Thursday, an additional 49 cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in NSW. The total number of cases is 2,822 Deaths: 22 Cases tested and excluded: 134,619 Total people tested: 137,441 A total of 543 of NSW\u2019s cases - nearly one-fifth - have originated from a cruise ship (in particular the Ruby Princess, which was controversially allowed to dock at Circular Quay in March). Of NSW\u2019s 2,822 cases; Overseas acquired: 1,677 Locally acquired (contact of confirmed case and/or known cluster): 682 Locally acquired (contact not identified): 427 Under investigation: 36 The largest number of infections, by age group, is among people aged 20 to 29, with 611 confirmed cases. This is interesting, from AAP: A group of 18 Queensland drivers has been hit with fines for disobeying coronavirus regulations after police stopped a noisy burnout gathering. Officers were called to an industrial area in Loganholme, south of Brisbane, where they cordoned off a street about 11pm on Thursday. More than 10 vehicles were intercepted and 18 infringement notices of $1,334 issued for failing to comply with a Covid-19 direction, police said on Friday. It seems the burn-outs were fine \u2013 if needless, noisy and self-defeating (they\u2019re your tyres after all) \u2013 you just can\u2019t do burn-outs in a group. I\u2019m reminded of that age-old philosophical question: if you do a massive burn-out, but none of your mates are around to watch, have you really burnt out at all? In case you missed this earlier, it\u2019s very good. Do try this at home. Stay home. Save Lives. Take the Bins Out*. *only on bin night The Western Australia minister for health and deputy premier Roger Cook has reported seven new cases of Covid-19 in the state, as well as four new cases linked to the cruise ship Artania. The 11 new cases are in people aged between 25 and 78, and bring the state\u2019s total to 506. The total number of cases linked to cruise ships is 191, more than one-third of the total. Six people have died in WA. Also in Western Australia, several hundred passengers who had been on board the Vasco da Gama cruise ship are due to end their quarantine today. The West Australian passengers have been held on Rottnest Island, they will be ferried back to Perth this afternoon. But hundreds of others from the east coast and other parts of Australia are coming out of quarantine, today and in coming days, without a way home because of mass cancellation of flights across the country. Cook said the state government would continue to accommodate those passengers, while finding a way to get them home. The state government is aware that there are limited flights available for people returning home following their 14-day isolation in Western Australia. The department of health is liaising with other agencies and airlines to determine viable solutions to get these people home as soon as practicable. While flights are being arranged to transport people home, they will continue to be accommodated by the state. We want to reassure people who have been in isolation that we will be working to make the transition home as smooth as possible so they can return to their homes and families as quickly as they can. We understand those in isolation and quarantine have enjoyed difficulty and stress and appreciate the sacrifice they and their family and friends are making to keep our communities safe. The state\u2019s deputy chief health officer Robin Lawrence said those who had completed their quarantine, but who were still waiting to fly home, would be allowed out of their hotels. For the passengers from the Vasco da Gama, that would be in a few hours. As of 4:30pm they will have some increased freedom to move around the local area and the city as long as they maintain social distancing, as required. We are very grateful for their patience and consideration during the 14 days they have been undertaking quarantine. For all other future passengers, we will be in contact to work out where they have come from and how they can get home and we thank them for their patience in keeping the state of Western Australia, themselves and their families safe this time. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer has posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW and ordered anyone returning to the state from those locations to quarantine for 14 days. It has been one week since Queensland closed its border to New South Wales for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919. Police have been enforcing the \u201chard closure\u201d at three checkpoints between the towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads on either side of the border. The gates have also been shut on the state\u2019s two other shared borders between the Northern Territory and South Australia. Queensland residents are exempt from the ban, but from Saturday those returning home from a list of designated inter-state \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d will be forced to undergo two weeks quarantine. Good afternoon, Ben Doherty here, my thanks to my colleagues for their work today. And thank you for your company this afternoon. Please feel free to get in touch via twitter @BenDohertyCorro or email ben.doherty@theguardian.com . Social distancing, how important is it? This, from the Ohio department of health in the US, is excellent. They\u2019ve wrapped up the press conference in Adelaide. And I\u2019m going to wrap up here, too. I\u2019ll leave you with my excellent colleague Ben Doherty who will take over from here. Cusack says at this stage there is no case to close the state\u2019s beaches. Marshall is asked about photographs local media published apparently showing groups of people. Marshall says: \u201cI have spent time down at the beach myself today and I can tell you that there were a lot of people enjoying their time but the most important thing is we are trying to guard against large numbers of people congregating in close vicinity, but not people walking the dog, going for a jog. \u201cWe do not want to see reporters, with all due respect, or members of the public try to separate people. They could be people of the same family, people living together.\u201d Cusack says there are 15 people in South Australian hospital. Six are in ICU and four are in a critical condition. Michael Cusack, the SA Health executive director of medical service, says that the state has recorded seven new cases overnight. There are 428 in the state. The cases range in age from 23 to a person in their 80s. He says: \u201cAt this point in time there is no link we have found between any of the cases in schools or any residential aged care facility, and importantly there are no additional cases where we think that there has been local transmission. In terms of good news, the number of people that are known to have recovered has increased ...\u201d The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, is addressing the media as we speak. Marshall says the former Wakefield hospital is now ready to take patients. It has been transformed into a Covid-19 facility. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will address the children of Australia in a special broadcast on the ABC, the network has announced. The ABC says in a statement that Morrison will answer questions from children on the Monday bulletin of its flagship children\u2019s news program, Behind The News. An ABC statement said the broadcast would include questions such as: \u201cMy question is, what\u2019s your advice to the population who have lost their jobs as their workplaces have shut down?\u201d \u201cHow long do you think it will take to find a cure for the coronavirus?\u201d The program will air 6.25pm on Monday. Advocates for the unemployed have called on the government to extend the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplements to disability support pensioners and carers. The Guardian reported last month that people on these payments would now receive a lower base rate of income support than a jobseeker or a person receiving parenting payment who did not have a disability. \u201c[The Australian Unemployed Workers Union] has been flooded with calls and messages from our members who have been unfairly excluded from the $550 supplement, and thousands of people have signed our petition to #RaiseTheDSP,\u201d a statement read. \u201cThe minister has been granted extraordinary new powers that mean she can do this without going back to parliament. No legislation is required.\u201d A Greens motion to include these welfare recipients in the coronavirus supplement failed to win the support of the government or Labor this week. However, the minister, Anne Ruston, can extend the supplement without legislation. \u201cI\u2019m on DSP, not parenting payment but I\u2019m the only person raising my children, why is it I\u2019m not seen to have extra costs/needs,\u201d said Emma, a respondent to an AUWU survey. Of the outbreak at the Northwest hospital, Courtney says: \u201cAll staff who worked at the Northwest regional hospital in the medical or surgical wards will be asked to quarantine for 14 days. We will be providing accommodation for those staff who are unable to quarantine in their own homes.\u201d Courtney says that staff will be tested, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. A fourth person has died in Tasmania, the state\u2019s health minister has just announced. Sarah Courtney says the man was elderly and died at Northwest hospital. She extends her condolences to his family. Courtney says there were four more Covid-19 cases confirmed overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 111. Northern Territory police have issued a statement outlining the fines issued yesterday for social distancing rules. Police said they fined a 32-year-old woman who \u201cabsconded from mandatory quarantine in Darwin\u201d. \u201cThe woman arrived in the NT on 7 April 2020, travelling from Adelaide and was required to remain in a hotel for 14 days,\u201d a police statement said. \u201cPolice located the woman and issued her a fine before returning her to her hotel.\u201d Police also said a 22-year-old man in Araluen also \u201cbreached quarantine by leaving his house to register his new vehicle at the MVR\u201d. \u201cThe man had returned to the NT by road from South Australia on 29 March 2020.\u201d A further six people were issued with infringement notices relating to mass gatherings. Police said 3,630 compliance checks had now been completed with 17 fines issued. Just to recap deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly\u2019s comments on the NRL\u2019s decision to restart. Kelly said emphasised that we all have a responsibility to continue with social distancing measures. He said that although the league\u2019s players were not at high risk, others who are involved in the game would be. Kelly specifically named two coaches, Wayne Bennett and Ricky Stuart, as being vulnerable to Covid-19. \u201cTo be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track,\u201d he said. He added that it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether May is the right time to restart the league, but that the NRL would \u201cdefinitely need to get some permission to do that\u201d. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed today that he hadn\u2019t been consulted prior to the league\u2019s announcement of a planned restart date. Kelly reiterates that the health advices on schools remains the same. That is that the schools can remain open. But he notes that \u201cwe\u2019ll be having more to say about schools in the coming weeks.\u201d And with that, the press conference has concluded. Kelly is asked by a journalist, and we are thankful to her: what about about NRL Island? He says: \u201cIt sounds like a reality show they might continue it on, not just the playing, but what happens for the rest of the week, the mind boggles. If they\u2019re by themselves and they\u2019re away from the rest of society, then that is a thing. \u201cBut I just reiterate the young men and women who play the game won\u2019t be the only ones there. They need to think carefully about their coaching staff and other supporters. And think about their social responsibility, even on the island.\u201d Is the NRL risking the community by saying they will return to the game? Kelly says: \u201cThe other part I say about the NRL, they\u2019re general very fit young men and women, so they \u2013 they themselves are not at high risk and if they were just part of the \u2013 I understand the proposal is to play -continue to play in empty stadium, so they could be their own microcosm. \u201cFor them, it may not be a big problem. There\u2019s other people around the teams, Wayne Bennett is in his 70s, he would be in a vulnerable group, Ricky Stuart with the mighty Raiders, he would potentially be in a vulnerable group, so thinking about the team, not just the players, but those \u2013 the support staff around them, is important. And, look, they\u2019re making their plans for the road out I encourage them to do so in other sports. But whether May is the time will remain to be seen and definitely they\u2019ll need to get some permission to do that.\u201d Kelly is asked about the NRL\u2019s plans to restart the game next month. He is asked whether the NRL would need permission from state government or whether they are, for want of a better word, \u201ca law unto unto themselves in this regard\u201d? He says: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re a law unto themselves. Some of the players and coaches may think so, but they\u2019re part of society and they have a part \u2013 as we have all done, to support not only safety for themselves but for all of us. To be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track. \u201cI\u2019ve said here before on average, what we know about this virus, if we don\u2019t have these social distancing measures, one person can lead to 400 other cases within a month. And so, that is the sort of explosive epidemic we\u2019ve seen in other countries. And we just cannot afford at this stage to be considering that happening.\u201d Kelly says border closures will be a component of what happens into the future. \u201cBut we also do need to our trade both back and forth, to continue in the society that we love. So these are all elements that will be part of the road out, as the Prime Minister said. It\u2019s too early to talk about that road out for the time being.\u201d Kelly says that \u201cthe curve is definitely decreasing\u201d. \u201cI would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. \u201cSo, we need to see what happens with those and to learn from other countries that have going through a much more difficult time with much larger epidemics to see what happens as they pass that peak and see what happens from there, about being guided, what to do to get back to some sort of normality, a new normality, I would suggest, at least in the shorter term.\u201d Kelly said that it would be a great \u201cachievement\u201d if the virus began to die out in parts of Australia. But he adds: \u201cIt does bring with it a challenge, of course, it would mean the most of us would not have been exposed yet. So we would remain susceptible to the virus if it was re-introduced.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has started speaking in Canberra. He is asked if about the possibility that people can became immune to the virus. \u201cYes, that would be a very important thing to know. At this stage, we\u2019re only - I calculated this week - 14weeks into the virus. Only the first cases in Australia were in mid-to-late January. So it\u2019s only very early. So at this stage, if we were able to look at people that might have been exposed at that time or indeed were diagnosed with the virus and see if they can immune now, it would be very short-term immunity still. \u201cIt remains to be seen what happens in the longer term. There\u2019s studies done in China, there will be studies here in Australia as well, looking at that immune element. But at this time we can\u2019t tell.\u201d Let\u2019s wrap up some of today\u2019s developments. NSW recorded its 22nd death and Victoria its 13th. It takes Australia\u2019s death toll to 53. Embattled NSW minister Don Harwin was fined $1,000 for breaching social distancing laws. Authorities are urging people to stay home for Easter, and police are turning people around who are heading to holiday spots. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is yet to discuss the NRL\u2019s restart date 28 May with the league. Tasmanian police have told 15 people on their way to holiday spots to go home during Covid-19 patrols over the past 24 hours. AAP reports that the force intercepted more than 35 people in cars - including some towing caravans and boats - and turned them back as needed. Three people have been arrested or summoned to appear in court over Covid-19 related offences, the force confirmed on Friday. \u201cThis Easter, if you are away from your primary residence and try to go to your shack and you don\u2019t have a valid excuse, you will not only be turned around, but you could be charged and face a substantial fine,\u201d Acting Assistant Commissioner Jo Stolp said. Premier Peter Gutwein told residents on Thursday not to leave their homes unnecessarily, with fines of up to $16,800 or six months\u2019 jail. Helicopters are monitoring people\u2019s movements, hovering over regional communities including Bicheno, Friendly Beaches, Coles Bay, Dunalley and Primrose Sands. Officers are also patrolling on foot in Bridport, St Helens, Longford, Great Lake, Port Sorell, Somerset and Smithton among the areas. Tasmania had recorded 111 cases of the virus as of Thursday night, with 48 of those people recovering. The NSW government has announced that healthcare workers would now benefit from free parking at public hospital carparks during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cOur healthcare workers are on the frontline of our battle with Covid-19 and we need to do whatever we can to support them during this difficult time,\u201d the premier, Gladys Berejiklian said. \u201cWe hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.\u201d The free parking begins from today. Some good news for the more than 100 Australian and New Zealand residents who were aboard the Antartica cruise that was anchored of the coast of Uruguay. AAP reports that the group are expected to land in Melbourne over Easter after Aurora Expeditions, the operator of the Greg Mortimer ship, chartered a flight from Montevideo. The news was confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told AAP on Friday. Of the more than 200 people on the vessel, 96 are Australian passengers and crew, along with roughly 16 New Zealand citizens. Five Australians have already been taken off the Greg Mortimer and admitted to hospital in Montevideo, DFAT said. Thanks to Michael for his efforts this morning. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you for today. Thanks for your company. I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will take you through the afternoon. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has issued a statement slamming celebrity chef Pete Evans, after the Channel Seven star and reality television host posted a video falsely suggesting a $15,000 light machine could be used treat Covid-19. In a live video posted to his Facebook page, the My Kitchen Rules judge said the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u201cis a pretty amazing tool\u201d and claims there are \u201ca thousand different recipes\u201d including \u201ca couple on there for Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. Evans is selling the product on his own website for $14,990. It states the product is \u201ca hybrid subtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d with \u201cfour transmitted energies\u201d which \u201cstimulate and invigorate the entire body to optimise and improve potential health, wellness and athletic performance\u201d. The post has been condemned by RACGP president Harry Nespolon, who said Evans, who has in the past promoted anti-vaccination views, \u201cneeds to stop\u201d. Nespolon said he had suggested several months ago Evans should \u201cleave vaccinations alone\u201d. \u201cWell, he should also steer well clear of peddling devices which he claims use \u2018subtle energy\u2019 to counter Covid-19. He just needs to stop it right now. \u201cIt is a reality that many people look up to Mr Evans in his roles as a popular chef and television host. I once again urge him to book an appointment with his local GP to learn about the damage he is doing on social media.\u201d Quickly to the ACT, where three new cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is now 103. The new confirmed cases are two women and one man, aged between 26 and 51. One is a close contact of a previous confirmed case and the other two are under investigation. Kerry Chant says the 69-year-old man who died in Newcastle overnight likely contracted the virus \u201cduring a recent trip interstate\u201d. The man had travelled to Queensland. Obviously, we are watching locally acquired cases, and I think from the beginning I\u2019ve explained that they raise the major concern for me, because they reflect areas where we might need to have that focused testing to establish there\u2019s not broader transmission in the community. So, earlier this week, I called upon the community to increase testing in some of those areas, where we had identified cases. We will continue to update and call on the community to come forward to have increased testing in areas where we identify local transmission. Asked about the $1,000 fine levelled against arts minister Don Harwin last night for breaching public health orders, he says: Look, as I said yesterday in relation to Mr Harwin, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are, there are very strict rules to try and keep us all safe. And the imposition of a fine, if that\u2019s what the police consider appropriate, is a matter for them. I can\u2019t comment beyond that. That\u2019s not my purview. Hazzard is asked about the NRL\u2019s announcement yesterday that they will restart the competition on 28 May. He says he has only had one meeting with the game, which was about four weeks ago before it was shutdown. If the NRL want to go ahead, happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it\u2019s appropriate. The only meeting I\u2019ve had that I can tell you about is around about a month ago, with [chief executive] Todd Greenberg and [chairman] Peter V\u2019landys to talk about the issue. But that was before they actually made a decision to shut the game down. So, I haven\u2019t had any discussions with them at this stage. Hazzard has recovered from his coughing fit and is back taking questions. He\u2019s asked about new $5,000 on-the-spot fines in NSW for people who cough or spit on health workers. If I had my choice, I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine. There is another option. And that is that if the police choose to they can actually enforce a court attendance notice and a charge, which would allow an $11,000 fine and $6,000. But this is an on-the-spot $5,000 fine. I can\u2019t remember any fine like this in the past history, where a police officer could hand over a $5,000 fine on the spot. It\u2019s quite unprecedented. He\u2019s asked about a McDonald\u2019s worker who was allegedly spat on yesterday, and whether the fines should be extended. Says they will look at it. The NSW police have issued almost 50 new fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. Chant thanks the people of NSW for helping to slow the spread, and urges people not to neglect their normal medical needs. Yesterday we reported that GP clinics across the country are reporting a major drop in patient numbers due to the pandemic, either because of Covid-19 fears or problems transitioning to telehealth services. It\u2019s been pleasing to see that we\u2019ve continued to see an increase in testing numbers. And my message to the community is to please, our services are open over the Easter period and I would urge you to continue to access those services. I\u2019d also like to [send a message] to the community that our services are safe and available, so it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t neglect any other underlying chronic diseases, or if you develop symptoms that need - that you need to access urgent care, please continue to do so. Hazzard has had to hand over mid-sentence to the NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant because he\u2019s having a coughing fit. New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking in Sydney. He\u2019s announced that a 69-year-old man has died at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle overnight, bringing the total number of deaths in NSW to 22. He says NSW has 49 new cases of Covid-19. That\u2019s very slightly more than the day before, when there was a three week low of 39 new cases. 211 cases are in NSW hospitals. 29 of those are in ICU. Of those 29, 23 are ventilated. If you haven\u2019t already watched Scottish sports broadcaster Andrew Cotter\u2019s commentary of his two labradors, Olive and Mabel, and their quiet battle over an orange rubber bone, I need to strongly insist you do so right now. It is, I assure you, an absolute tonic. My colleague Steph Harmon has written about it: The Gold Coast Airport has closed its terminal because there are no regular scheduled commercial flights to the tourism hotspot for the foreseeable future. AAP reports the terminal closed on Friday after the last Qantas and Virgin flights departed on Thursday. The operation of the runway and airfield operations will continue for general aviation and other activities. Gold Coast Airport boss Marion Charlton says the terminal will open when regular passenger flights resume. \u201cThe aviation industry is at the front line of this crisis, with passenger numbers falling steadily since the beginning of March,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our partners throughout this challenging time.\u201d A few scenes of the Easter long weekend in Australia. Victoria has recorded another Covid-19 death, taking Australia\u2019s national death toll to 52. The latest death is a man in his 80s who died in hospital, the state government confirmed on Friday. It marks the 13th person to die from the virus in the state. Victoria also recorded 13 new cases in the past 24 hours. Forty-three people remain in hospital, with 13 of those in intensive care. Seven people have been released in the last 24 hours. Queensland\u2019s health minister, Stephen Miles, is speaking in Brisbane. The state has recorded 13 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. He\u2019s also confirmed that the state has issued 289 fines for breaches of public health orders. The fines begin at $1,300. Miles also revealed that one person in the state has been charged for allegedly spitting at a nurse. I was of course disgusted to hear that report [and] concerned for the wellbeing of that particular nurse, but nobody should treat our health workers like that. Everyone should know that the police will enforce the law and I understand charges have been laid. Hard to fathom, really. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared on one of the commercial breakfast TV networks and admitted to feeling \u201ca degree of frustration\u201d with Australians stranded overseas. Thousands of Australians remain scattered overseas, and on Thursday the foreign affais minister outlined plans for charter flights for people trying to get home from various parts of the world. A special Qantas flight from Peru landed in Australia overnight. Birmingham said: There are frustrations, no doubt about that. We were one of the early countries in the world to urge Australians reconsider their need to travel, and to urge them to come home and to ultimately to urge them to or to tell them that travel was not to be undertaken and to enforce quite strict arrangements in place. There is a degree of frustration there. But our diplomats have been working day and night around the world to come up with solutions to help Australians be able to safely get home. That is why we have stepped in to make sure there are some regular flights available over the next few weeks. We can\u2019t guarantee that it will go on beyond that. But you can get home from places if you can connect in to London or Hong Kong or Singapore or San Francisco because we put in place those regular flights. We are also looking at exceptional circumstances where we do need to work to get aviation capacity into places such as Peru, where there is a flight that has come in overnight. It is the second one that has come out of there in a space of about a week. We have circumstances in Uruguay that we are working through, in South African and the Philippines. These are incredibly complex arrangements given the travel restrictions that other countries have imposed and the collapse in international aviation. It is not unreasonable that Australians who are overseas, some of whom will have ignored the travel warnings, will have to make a contribution to their return. Police in Victoria have issued 98 fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. The fines include nine children who were fined \u201cfor gathering in a private residence\u201d and a man who received four warnings before he was fined. Unlike in NSW, police in Victoria have refused to release data about the locations of the fines. We also don\u2019t know any demographic indicators about the people who have been fined. So, for example, their housing status or ethnicity. Victoria police say they conducted 754 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services in the past 24 hours. Since 21 March they have conducted a total of 18,386 spot checks. Once upon a time, when I was a journalist at a regional newspaper, my colleagues and I used to joke about the carbon-copy stories we\u2019d be forced to write on an annual basis. People working on Christmas Day, police warnings about double demerits and, of course, lines at the fish co-op on Good Friday. Well, Covid-19 has at least added a bit of spice to the latter yarn. AAP reports that the Sydney Fish Market will still open its doors for what is usually one its busiest days but this year strict social distancing measures and temperature checks will be in place. More than 40,000 people usually flock to the market on Good Friday to snap up seafood for the Easter weekend but this year only 400 people will be allowed on the site at one time. People will have their temperature checked on arrival, be given hand sanitiser and be asked to follow social distancing rules to limit the spread of Covid-19. \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a very different Easter down at the fish market this weekend,\u201d a spokeswoman, Stephanie Margrain, told AAP. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no oysters on the boardwalk ... Come down, shop quickly and get home.\u201d The market has been working with NSW police and NSW Health to develop a plan that ensures people who have made a tradition out of going to the fish market on Good Friday can continue to do so safely. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to encourage lots of people to come down like we normally would, but we\u2019re conscious for many it is a tradition,\u201d she said. A 31-year-old man Palm Beach will face drug charges after Queensland police allegedly found 93kg of cannabis during a stop at a state border checkpoint on Wednesday. In a statement this morning Queensland police said officers at the checkpoint intercepted a Ford Ranger utility with a trailer trying to enter Queensland about 5.30pm on Wednesday. It will be alleged that during a search of the vehicle police found 93kg of cannabis and $4,300 in cash. Police say the drugs have a street value of about $450,000. A 31-year-old Palm Beach man was arrested and charged with the possession of dangerous drugs and the possession of property suspected of be used in connection with a drug offence. He has been bailed to appear at the Coolangatta magistrates court on 6 July. The man was also issued a $1,334 infringement notice for breaching the state\u2019s public health orders. Detective Inspector Chris Ahearn from the Gold Coast criminal investigation branch said \u201cany person attempting to enter our state, even if they are a Queensland resident, should expect a heightened level of scrutiny\u201d. \u201cIn addition to the current biosecurity risks, police will remain vigilant to disrupt any criminal activity,\u201d Ahearn said. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has released his own Easter message. Like the prime minister he\u2019s urged people to stay home during the \u201conce-in-a-generation health crisis\u201d caused by Covid-19. Easter is traditionally a time when Australians gather together. For Christians, they go to church services. For other Australians, they spend time together with family, with friends, and with other members of their local community. But this Easter is different. We need people to stay home. To stay home in the interest of their own health. But also, the health of others. The COVID-19 crisis is a once in a generation health crisis. And we need to take it seriously. Whilst overwhelmingly we want Australians to stay home, some people will be working. Our health workers, our police and emergency services, our transport workers. Some who work in industries like our supermarkets who will continue to work over the Easter break. We need to give them our thanks. They are keeping us safe and doing an extraordinary job in difficult times. This age of social distancing and self-isolation means that we are all keeping 1.5 metres apart. But in so many ways, we as Australians have never been as together as we are now. So, I wish all Australians a peaceful Easter at home. The good news for kids is that the Easter bunny is allowed to visit your home this Sunday. I wish you and your family all the best this Easter. The New South Wales Labor opposition has, perhaps unsurprisingly, seized on the $1,000 fine issued to the arts minister, Don Harwin, overnight. The shadow arts minister, Walt Secord, has issued a statement calling for Gladys Berejiklian to sack Harwin: The premier has no choice but to sack the arts minister. Yesterday, she defended him. An apology is not enough. Mr Harwin is a personal friend of the premier and a factional ally, but he is not above the law. He has been travelling back and forth to Sydney from Pearl Beach. Pearl Beach is an elderly community. These health orders are there to protect the most vulnerable. A man wearing an Akubra and brandishing a whip has been charged after allegedly threatening people outside the Chinese consulate in Sydney. After footage of the alleged incident was shared widely on social media, police said a 55-year-old was arrested at Dee Why on Thursday and charged after allegedly cracking the whip outside the consulate on 31 March. \u201cPolice will allege in court that the man threatened several members of the public while cracking the whip,\u201d they said. Let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s in the other papers today. The Sydney Morning Herald leads on Covid-19 clusters inside New South Wales hospitals after the state\u2019s health department revealed on Thursday that 12 new cases have been discovered at Gosford hospital. Two were hospital patients, six staff and four family members or friends. The paper is also reporting the concerns of retail workers, who say they are \u201cscared and desperate\u201d about catching Covid-19 and are begging for businesses to stop in-store trading. The Age in Melbourne lead on the education minister Dan Tehan\u2019s threat to cut funding to independent schools if they close during the pandemic. The Australian reports that the University of Melbourne will take a $500m revenue hit this year because of Covid-19, as the vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, and his executive team take a 20% pay cut. The Oz also says more than 600,000 Australians have registered their interest in drawing down as much as $20,000 from their superannuation funds. In Sydney the News Limited tabloid Daily Telegraph leads on Don Harwin, in Melbourne the Herald Sun goes coronavirus-free on the front page, instead reporting on the Good Friday cancer fundraising appeal, and the Hobart Mercury splashes on the Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein\u2019s message that \u201cthe gloves are off\u201d in police enforcement of public health orders over the Easter long weekend. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been moved out of intensive care. In a statement a few hours ago a spokesman said: The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits. You can follow our UK live blog here: As the rate of infection in Australia continues to fall, authorities are nervous about the potential for the Easter long weekend \u2013 when many people usually travel \u2013 could seet off a new wave of Covid-19 cases. They\u2019ve been urging people to stay at home over the break, and state premiers have warned police will be out in large numbers enforcing lockdown rules. Drawing on his faith, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, used his Easter message to drive home the importance of social distancing: I hope it is a time as you come together in your homes, together with your immediate family, that it will be a strong reminder about what\u2019s most important. For Christians, not being able to gather does not diminish the hope that we have through this important Easter period. This year, we will live out our faith by doing the right thing. That means staying at home, making sure we\u2019re checking on our neighbours and supporting our communities and families, our friends. First up, a little bit more on that Don Harwin news. Late last night the New South Wales police issued a statement saying they had issued a fine after being \u201calerted\u201d that a 55-year-old man had \u201crelocated to a holiday home at Pearl Beach, in contravention of current Ministerial Direction under the Public Health Act\u201d. \u201cAs part of inquiries, investigators from Central Metropolitan Region attended the Elizabeth Bay home unit and spoke with the man,\u201d NSW police said. \u201cFollowing further inquiries, the man was issued a $1000 PIN via email just before 9pm.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he didn\u2019t break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home on 13 March, before the state lockdown came into effect. But multiple reports on Thursday indicated Harwin had travelled back to Sydney for appointments while staying at the Central Coast property. \u201cNo one individual or corporation is above these laws \u2013 anyone suspected of breaching the orders will be investigated and if a breach is detected, they will be dealt with in accordance with the Act,\u201d said the police commissioner, Mick Fuller. \u201cOn behalf of the community, I strongly urge those with information about breaches to contact police.\u201d Good morning. It\u2019s Friday, 10 April. Welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia. I\u2019m Michael McGowan. I\u2019ll be bringing you all of today\u2019s Good Friday news, but first here\u2019s how we left things last night: Australia reported its lowest number of new cases in three weeks on Thursday, with 96 people diagnosed since the last update, nationally. It was the first time in three weeks Australia\u2019s new cases have dropped below 100. One 76-year-old South Australian man died, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 51. The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s strict public health orders. Harwin got himself in strife after it emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the Berejiklian government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two. Tehan said he would make independent schools\u2019 funding contingent on complying with the order. The Block star Scott Cam has agreed to forgo his $345,000 salary as Australia\u2019s \u201cnational careers ambassador\u201d. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said Cam had agreed to give up his salary given his \u201crole has fundamentally changed\u201d due to Covid-19."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
