I wish I knew I wasn't alone", "bodyText": "I\u2019m out to dinner with friends. The waitress approaches, and I cringe. Here it comes. I\u2019m about to do The Speech. I point to my wrist, to my Medic Alert bracelet. \u201cCan you let the chef know I\u2019m allergic to \u2026\u201d \u2013 I rattle off a list of allergens and explain they can cause anaphylaxis. I joke that the restaurant doesn\u2019t want an ambulance out front, that it\u2019s bad for business. I don\u2019t do it to be jovial. I do it to get my point across: My life is in your hands. You could kill me. Irritation flickers on the waitress\u2019s face: \u201cWhat was it again?\u201d I point to the menu and explain what I think could be a safe option \u2013 minus the sauce. \u201cHang on. I\u2019ll go check.\u201d I apologise to my friends. They tell me it\u2019s no trouble. The waitress returns; there\u2019s a problem with my choice. We negotiate a different one. She goes back to the kitchen. I hold up everyone, yet again. I just want it to be over with. When my meal arrives, I sample some and wait. No tingling, no swelling, no itchiness. When I leave, I profusely thank the staff for their service; I thank them for not killing me. And so it goes with every social gathering at a restaurant, at a friend\u2019s house, at anywhere food is served. Food is central to how we interact; we celebrate by breaking bread and clinking glasses. But for allergy sufferers, dining out is an anxiety-producing nightmare. Our first thought is not, \u201cWhat would I like to eat?\u201d But, \u201cWhat won\u2019t kill me?\u201d Of course, when it comes to dietary restrictions, allergy sufferers aren\u2019t alone. We are in the company of diabetics, vegans, vegetarians, the gluten or lactose intolerant, those with restrictions imposed by religion, those who simply hate mushrooms. But allergic folk are more troublesome. Menus don\u2019t indicate safe choices for us, and there\u2019s the added risk of cross-contamination, unwitting kitchen mix-ups or indifference. I also suffer from chronic atopic eczema. The two are separate conditions but they often come hand-in-hand. And if it\u2019s tough for me as an adult, spare a thought for a child, or for the parent of a toddler with food allergies. I\u2019ve suffered from eczema and allergies since the age of five. My condition has swung from barely there, to present but manageable, to actively impacting my quality of life, to life-threatening. There\u2019s no consistency. It\u2019s unpredictable, often from one hour to the next, and that\u2019s what makes it hard to accept. Because the times you\u2019re well, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhat is it I\u2019m doing right?\u201d And the times you\u2019re unwell, \u201cWhat am I doing wrong?\u201d You rarely get an answer to either. Severe eczema can feel like being eaten alive by a swarm of mosquitos. It can also feel like sunburn, except you\u2019re burning from the inside out. You get tired and headachy, feel restless and on edge, and you\u2019re acutely self-conscious of your appearance. Sleep doesn\u2019t even bring peace. You scratch all night long. In short, it\u2019s utterly exhausting. But what we don\u2019t talk about is the mental strain. The resulting anxiety and depression, the impact on family and friends, the cost of simply trying to survive. Medicines, creams, lotions and potions, doctor appointments, gap fees. The costs add up economically and emotionally. Add to that a backdrop of a society obsessed with beauty, with correcting imperfections, and it becomes a recipe for self-loathing and despair. When I was a teenager I hated myself with a passion. I was mortified by my condition and I did everything I could to try to hide it \u2013 even if that meant putting myself at risk. Sometimes I did things to fit in, with the full knowledge I\u2019d pay the price later. Resentment reigned supreme, and I was deeply jealous of anyone who was healthy. Why did I have to be the one? Excursions, a sleepover, summer camp \u2013 were not joyous occasions, but exercises in risk to be forward-planned and managed. I wish I had a book growing up which showed me I wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s why I wrote one. My book, Sensitive, isn\u2019t just for those kids though; it\u2019s also for those who want insight into their lives. I hope the hospitality industry reads it, because more often than not sufferers are placing their lives in the hands of complete strangers, praying they\u2019ll be taken seriously. The alternative is to become a hermit \u2013 and who wants to live like that? But mostly I\u2019ve written Sensitive for kids like me. For kids who feel ashamed, different, less-than. I want them to know they\u2019re not alone and that the emotions they struggle with are legitimate and real. Putting on a brave face doesn\u2019t always cut it. It\u2019s OK to admit it sucks. \u2022 Sensitive, a YA book by Allayne Webster, is out now through UQP"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
