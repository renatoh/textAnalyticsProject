This would mean that I would be paid more. A colleague has said that I should use the grievance procedure. Is this a good route to take? Yes, there are benefits to using the grievance procedure. In fact, concerns over pay and grading are the most common types of issues taken to grievance hearings, according to research by the bulletin IRS Employment Trends. Large employers in particular are aware that they need to run fair grievance procedures. Many are updating their systems to reflect new guidance from Acas and to recognise that employees can now be accompanied by a union representative (even if they do not belong to a union). Asking a union rep to accompany you could be helpful. Your employers would realise that your union rep believes you have a strong case as they are loath to champion hopeless causes. You need to get your evidence written down and outlined clearly, with examples of why you are in the wrong grading. You should compare your job description, the description of the grading levels and the tasks that you perform. The last thing you want is to have a good case but to fudge it with a woolly presentation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
