The British No1's emphatic 6-2, 6-2 win over the Swede Sofia Arvidsson, a former top 70 player, was only her second win in nine attempts in this Wimbledon warm-up event, but it did not prevent her from talking an even better match than she played. \"It was only last year that I got in on my ranking and in previous years I needed a wild card, so to be here and to be seeded and hopefully one of the contenders for the title \u2013 you know I've come a long way,\" Keothavong said. What surprises many is that Keothavong has risen steadily at an age \u2013 25 \u2013 when many players stop making major improvement. Yesterday she was unrecognisable from the player who had struggled for so many years here on the soft grass. She started a little nervously and almost went 3-0 down. But once that deficit was averted, she was in virtually complete control. Keothavong took six successive games, launched two linesman-threatening aces in the seventh game and loomed over her opponent's second serve so distractingly that Arvidsson concluded the first set with a double fault. A break for 4-2 in the second set, sealed with an unreachable drop shot, all but sealed the outcome. Afterwards Keothavong fielded an inquiry as to whether her success is implicit criticism of how women's tennis is run in Britain. \"It's each to their own,\" she responded. \"You can have all the help you want. There are people at the national tennis centre to help players and it's how you make use of those people. It's down to the players. Those who come through have to show willingness to do it for themselves, not for anyone else. \"It's taken me quite a bit of time to get here. But people develop in their own time and everyone's different.\" Keothavong continues her attempt to prove she is a title contender by facing Sania Mirza, a dangerously hard-hitting Indian attempting to make her way back after a wrist operation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
