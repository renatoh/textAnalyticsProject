When the prisoners emerge blinking into the light at the end of the first half of Fidelio, they are beckoned not into a prison yard but into the Manor House's formal gardens, presumably to admire the topiary. The company's first Fidelio, this is also, surprisingly, the first staging of Beethoven's opera from veteran director John Cox. While recent productions have tried (sometimes too hard) to stress the enduring topicality of the theme of hope winning through against totalitarianism, Cox just lets the story unfold. Gary McCann's costumes set it in Beethoven's time, and the characters move around the scaffolding walkways and concrete cistern covers with barely any props to hide behind. It is, in fact, almost too plain, too black-and-white, for an opera that, for all its idealism, should have a few uncomfortable grey areas. But it works. Douglas Boyd sets sluggish tempos early on, but the orchestral playing gains impetus and drama as the evening progresses. Rebecca von Lipinski is an unusually young Leonore, and sounds that way, but her relatively light soprano adds a vulnerability to her character that is entirely convincing in context. Her great outburst and aria in act one is less a diva-like mission statement than a genuine outpouring of emotion. Peter Wedd's strong tenor captures Florestan's desperation, and Claire Ormshaw's bright Marzelline makes a big impression. The evil prison governor Don Pizarro shouldn't really get to steal the show. But the starry casting of Sergei Leiferkus changes all that. Visually, with his lank black pigtail, devil-red jacket and scowl, he wouldn't be far out of place in panto. Audibly, his crisp, powerful singing supplies any missing subtlety, and the temperature rises whenever he is on stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
