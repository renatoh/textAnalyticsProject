Yet it is hard to think of a BBC director general who could arrive with greater goodwill at such a difficult time as the former Royal Opera House boss, who returns to run the BBC in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine debacles. Among broadcasters there is a palpable feeling that at last they have got someone who knows how to run a big organisation, who likes and admires journalists, whose political antennae are well honed, and a leader who is not afraid to innovate and surprise. All this promises well, as does Lord Hall's manifest commitment to the arts and his background in news, two fields in which the BBC has an obligation to lead. If he can also cut the bureaucracy, keep the salaries under control and steer the BBC through the licence fee negotiations in 2017, Lord Hall will deserve praise after the event as well as before it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
