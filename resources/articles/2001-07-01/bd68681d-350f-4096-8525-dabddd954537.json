And his new play, which follows The Shape of the Table and Pentecost in dealing with the fractious new Europe, offers a detailed, engrossing study of the difficulty of reconciling opposing nationalist forces. But, although the play's arguments apply well beyond Europe, they sometimes fall into an over-neat diagrammatic pattern. Edgar's opening scene lays out the territory. Two sides are locked in fierce debate. Words take on a different meaning for each group: one man's \"people's army\" is another man's \"terrorist conspiracy\". An analogy is also drawn with a James Dean movie in which two guys drive cars straight at each other and whoever swerves first loses: all peace negotiations are a calculated gamble in which each side has to second-guess its opponent. Gradually we realise that what we are watching is a role-playing academic seminar simulating diplomatic reality. What the scene also does is anticipate the complex battle that follows. Inside the former Soviet republic of Kavkhazia lies a largely Muslim province, Drozhdevnya, that wants independence. But, as the two sides fight on the ground, attempts are made by a Finnish peace-broker to hammer out an accord that will guarantee a democratic, multi-ethnic state. Just when it looks as if a deal has been reached, however, one side swerves and the whole cyclical process starts all over again. Edgar's strength lies in conveying the nitty-gritty of negotiation. The best scene takes place in the Finnish diplomat's house where talks break down over a Kavkhaz demand that the Drozhdan side \"renounce\" violence: only when this is diluted to \"voluntarily relinquish\" can a treaty be signed. Edgar also conveys very well the sense of a Europe oppressed by its turbulent past. \"I wanted to make history,\" a Kavkhaz negotiator says. \"But we find there's too much history already.\" But Edgar's political accuracy is not matched by his mastery of action. Scenes depicting civil war, not least one where Trevor Cooper's Kavhkaz commander forces Diana Kent's British aid worker to make an artificial life-or-death choice, look as if they have been set up to illustrate the play's moral dilemmas. It is a relief when Michael Attenborough's well-paced production returns us to the conflicts of the peace table: it is also here that the performances of Penny Downie as the increasingly exasperated Finn, Zoe Waites as a militant Drozhdan, Robert Bowman as her intransigent opponent and Larry Lamb as an interventionist American come into their own. Edgar's forte is for the minute particulars of politics, and it is on this level that his intricately plotted play succeeds. Until October 13. Box office: 01789 403403.
