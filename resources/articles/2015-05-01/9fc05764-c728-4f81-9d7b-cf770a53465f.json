The Dutchman was speaking after he had presented David de Gea with the supporters\u2019 player of the year award at the presentation evening, which took place at Old Trafford. After making a long speech and heading for his seat next to the assistant manager, Ryan Giggs, at a table close to the dais, Van Gaal decided to return in what became a bizarre moment. Taking the microphone from the presenter, Hayley McQueen, the 63-year-old said: \u201cI want to say something. Pay attention to the manager \u2013 Ryan Giggs said to me, and he is always right but in this case particularly right. I have said to you \u2013 you are the best fans in the world but tonight I was a little bit disappointed and I shall say why. \u201cI have seen a lady who plays the saxophone fantastically. Give her big applause.\u201d While this did, indeed, draw an ovation from the audience in the Manchester Suite, Van Gaal finally stepped down for good. In his initial speech he claimed United were close to the champions, Chelsea, despite being 15 points behind with a match left. \u201cYou remember away game against Chelsea?\u201d he said of the game on 18 April at Stamford Bridge, which United lost 1-0. \u201cNo, no, no, you have to listen. I ask you to listen because at that time we have 50 points and then [Wayne] Rooney sat in the dressing room \u2013 we go for the second place, he said that. [Before that] six games in a row we win and then we go to Chelsea. Who are the better team then? It\u2019s easy to say that now in this room. I can believe it but it was the truth but we lost. \u201cWe lost that game but can you imagine when you have 80% ball possession you have 10 big possibilities and they have three. They have three and they win the game. When we win that game count the numbers of points we could have won because after that we lost three games in a row. What I want to say to you, we are very close.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
