The prospect of no clear winner when Britain heads to the polling booths in May is already pushing down next year\u2019s growth and business investment predictions, according to the EY Item Club\u2019s autumn forecast. It also cites the weakening eurozone economy and geopolitical tensions, including the Ukraine crisis, as threats that are making businesses nervous. The Item Club predicts that business investment growth will slow sharply next year, from 9% in 2014 to 5.8% in 2015. That will hamper economic growth, tipped to fall from 3.1% this year to 2.4% in 2015. The warning comes as new economic data are due that will probably show the British recovery slowed down between July and September. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, believes that, with polls showing next year\u2019s election is hard to call, the uncertainty and nervousness in the financial markets around the election will be much greater than in 2010. \u201cThis makes it very difficult for anyone engaged in business planning to manage a company through this uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have had this conversation in 1997. The gulf between the parties this time is enormous.\u201d Businesses are also worried by the prospect of a referendum over Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, Spencer said. \u201cThe comparative advantage we offer foreign investors is dependent on the fact we are a haven of political stability, and our proximity to Europe. If both of those are brought into question, what happens to the likes of Nissan and Toyota, or financial services firms in the City?\u201d Spencer pointed out that Germany\u2019s industrial productivity and exports had fallen sharply in August, as the Ukraine crisis and eurozone fears had risen. \u201cA huge uncertainty shock is really hammering Germany\u2019s economy now,\u201d he said, illustrating the dangers facing Britain. \u201cIt is a very good example of what can happen if businesses get clutched by this sort of risk.\u201d The UK economy is also a long way from regaining its full potential following the financial crisis, he added. The EY Item Club, which uses the Treasury\u2019s model of the UK economy, flagged up that exporters are suffering from the stalling European recovery and the fall in the value of the euro. HM Treasury agreed that the eurozone area, Britain\u2019s largest trade partner, is a \u201cgrowing risk\u201d, saying: \u201cWe have to recognise that the UK is not immune to these problems, which is why we will continue working through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\u201d Data due on Friday will show how the UK economy performed in the third quarter of 2014. Economists predict that GDP increased by 0.7% in the quarter, a slowdown compared with 0.9% between April and June. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there was a risk that growth could be weaker, given \u201climited industrial production and the very real possibility that construction output contracted\u201d. The retail industry is also struggling. Footfall across UK high streets, out of town retail parks and shopping centres around the UK was down by 0.9% year-on-year in September, according to figures from Springboard, after a 1.1% fall in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
