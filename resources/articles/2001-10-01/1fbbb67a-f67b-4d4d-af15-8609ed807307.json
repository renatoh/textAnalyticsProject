This may be because the early publication of the long list took some of the impact out of the announcement, including as it did most of the titles critics and publishers alike might have expected to find on a possible short list, and because the decision to publish the long list for the first time reduced the need to make the short list itself appear more 'democratic'. For the past two years, the short lists have included one novel by an author and publisher previously unheard of, as if to refute the charge that the prize only bothers with established writers and instead earning the charge of tokenism. This time round, such pat-on-the-back inclusions could be dealt with in the long list, leaving the judges free to fill the short list with books that have a real chance of winning. No one, I think, would argue with the presence of McEwan and Carey on the list, but these two previous winners might have had less favourable odds had the judges in 1999 not had the courage to award the prize to J.M. Coetzee, the first time a panel had ignored the unspoken assumption that it was a bit unfair for someone to get it twice. It seems to have liberated this year's panel to shed sentimental concerns and focus on the very best book of the year, rather than viewing the prize as a lifetime achievement award, evident in the absence of eternal bridesmaid Beryl Bainbridge from the short list. The two other writers notable for their absence were Philip Pullman, whose magnificent The Amber Spyglass may never quite have shaken off the reductive label 'children's novel' but certainly helped to dismantle the perceived barriers between literary forms, and Nick Hornby, only now beginning to be recognised as a serious and intelligent novelist who just happens to have bestseller appeal. The Booker has often been accused of elitism, but any institution purporting to sift according to quality will always be accused of the same. It should not be ashamed of appointing (for the most part) 'intellectual' judges, nor should it be made to compromise its choices. This year, the panel seem to have avoided any temptation to popularise and, while the short list will bring welcome attention to some younger writers, it seems that the panel face a difficult choice between the two frontrunners. Ian McEwan Atonement Jonathan Cape \u00a316.99, pp372 McEwan's ninth novel, his first since last winning the Booker with Amsterdam in 1998, begins in a country house in 1935, and follows its young occupants and their relationships through the years of the war and on into old age at the end of the century. His story is concerned with time and memory and - significantly - how life is represented and altered through the imagination. Observer verdict: 'Impressive, engrossing, deep and surprising' \u00b7 Hermione Lee Odds: 9/4 Andrew Miller Oxygen Sceptre \u00a314.99, pp323 Miller's third novel is his first to be set in the present, and the title is also the title of a play central to the story. Like the play, the novel's focus is divided between three main characters: Laszlo, the Hungarian playwright; Alec, the translator; and his brother Larry. Each must confront his past as the disparate stories gradually draw together. Observer verdict: 'You have the suspicion that Andrew Miller's writing might be capable of anything' \u00b7 Tim Adams Odds: 9/2 Rachel Seiffert The Dark Room Heinemann \u00a312.99, pp391 Seiffert's first novel bravely approaches the well-worn terrain of the Holocaust and its legacy, though this time from a German perspective. Helmut is fervently patriotic, but his disability prevents him joining the army. Lore is 12 when her Nazi parents are arrested. Half a century later, Michael must discover whether his grandfather was responsible for massacres in Belarus. Observer verdict: 'Simply phrased and understated... shatters prejudices' \u00b7 Zoe Green Odds: 6/1 David Mitchell number9dream Sceptre \u00a310, pp418 Like his first novel, Ghostwritten, Mitchell's second is a complex interleaving of different narratives set in a Blade Runner-esque Tokyo. Eiji Miyake's quest to find his father takes him on a picaresque journey through the city, with its high-octane blend of sex, capitalism, computerised images and violence. Observer verdict: 'He is a wonderfully amphibious writer, happy in all manner of elements' \u00b7 Robert MacFarlane Odds: 8/1 Peter Carey True History of the Kelly Gang Faber \u00a316.99, pp351 Carey is another previous winner (for Oscar and Lucinda in 1988) and this novel also takes up a historical story - the biography of Australian outlaw Ned Kelly, told in his own voice. Carey's conceit is that Kelly has kept an account of his life for his unseen daughter, written in the style and idiom of Kelly's one surviving letter. Observer verdict: 'Wonderful... utterly convincing and continually surprising, creating new pleasures on every page' \u00b7 Jane Rogers Odds: 15/8 fav Ali Smith Hotel World Hamish Hamilton, \u00a310.99, pp236 Smith's second novel, also nominated for the Orange Prize, is a blend of narratives by five different women whose only connection is the Global Hotel in an unnamed town. The first narrator is already dead, struggling to remember the details of life, and the following stories, while less surreal, are no less dark. Observer verdict: 'Smith's eye for the detail of urban life is cinematic, but her language transforms her stories into parable' \u00b7 Stephanie Merritt Odds: 8/1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
