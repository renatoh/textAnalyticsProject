What if a friendly state becomes hostile? What if enemy forces surge beyond expectations? What if defenses do not work as planned? The higher the potential costs of the answer, the greater the question's significance. And, when it comes to nuclear matters, what-ifs, however iffy, assume fantastic importance. As debate heats up over Tony Blair's decision to refurbish Britain's aging nuclear deterrent, what-ifs are now swarming around Britain's defense establishment like malarial mosquitoes - dangerous and persistent. \"What if\" is the essential argument - if it can be called that - for the government's decision to continue deploying 16 megatons of destructive power in the post-Cold War world, even though Britain's deterrent does not actually deter. After all, nuclear weapons will not dissuade a terrorist attack, and a nuclear conflict between states is most likely to occur between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or possibly between China and the United States over Taiwan. True, the US may militarily confront Iran - as might Israel. Nuclear deterrents clearly remain relevant even in a world focused on terrorism, but it's hard to imagine a scenario in which Britain figures. And, yet, what if? What if Iran or North Korea held London hostage to prevent an attack by US or Nato forces aimed at destroying its nuclear infrastructure? It's a prudent question. Which is why the dominant metaphor of the Trident debate has been that of insurance, the incarnation of humanity's aversion to risk. As the Economist approvingly opened an editorial on the subject, \"Like a wise householder protecting his home against remote but catastrophic risks, Tony Blair says his decision on December 4th to build a new generation of submarine-based nuclear weapons was just 'insurance' in a turbulent world.\" But there may be a more apt, if less flattering, analogy. Nuclear weapons have a way of producing obsessive-compulsive thinking in military strategists. War planners may begin with a rational premise, proceed via logical steps, and yet arrive at an absurd worst-case conclusion. The phenomenon is reminiscent of an obsessive-compulsive who gets out of bed several times a night to check if he has turned off the oven, even if he's almost certain he did so hours earlier. The potentially catastrophic consequence of being wrong - a fatal gas explosion - make disrupting his sleep a wise investment. The benefits outweigh the costs. Repeated over time, however, such behavior results in neurotic paralysis. Actions that are rational on a small scale become profoundly irrational on a large scale. American nuclear policy during the Cold War often exhibited such characteristics. Although America had thousands of warheads capable of raining millions of Hiroshimas worth of destruction on the Soviet Union, Washington often feared it was underarmed. Why? In the 1970s, some American strategists posited a \"third strike\" dilemma. In this scenario, the Soviet Union might knock out U.S. land-based Minutemen silos - a so-called \"counterforce\" strike that purposely avoided our cities - while retaining some nuclear weapons in reserve. The fear was that, even though the United States could retaliate using missiles from its nuclear submarines (which are essentially invulnerable because they're hard to detect), it would choose not to. After all, the Soviets could then strike yet again, destroying our cities. American fear of this vulnerability prompted a late surge in the Cold War arms race. This thinking seemed rational, but its veneer of logic concealed serious flaws. For one thing, the enormous destructive power of even a single nuclear weapon makes leaders risk averse. Even when the US had a theoretical first-strike capability, as during the Cuban missile crisis, it was restrained by the possibility that a handful of Soviet missiles might survive to retaliate against American cities. Furthermore, the US would have been hard-pressed to identify a Soviet attack as \"only\" counterforce: thousands of incoming warheads would have looked like an all-out attack and prompted a rapid response. Finally, even if it had been possible to discern the \"limited\" nature of such a pulse-pounding onslaught, it is impossible to believe that an American president would not have responded after the 2,000 megatons of explosives needed to obliterate the Minutemen had detonated on American soil. Britain must ask itself whether the seduction of the what-if has not lured it to an illogical conclusion. The odds of Iran or North Korea attacking Britain with a nuclear missile are vanishingly small. For one thing, neither state yet has such a capability. For another, an attack on Britain would be considered an attack on Nato, which includes the US with its still-formidable atomic arsenal. Finally, it's worth noting that if Britain \"disarmed,\" it would retain the knowledge - and perhaps the fissile material - to reconstitute its weapons. No state could attack Britain without expecting an eventual nuclear response. To the extent that any country needs these weapons, Britain and France arguably need them the least. Non-nuclear states facing nuclear foes, such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, have a much stronger case. Yet the UK cannot shake its compulsion to keep them. We must ask, if a state under no direct threat from another nuclear state cannot afford to disarm, then who could, and when? Blair has suggested that Britain might need nuclear weapons in the eventuality that a rogue state helped a terrorist group build a nuclear weapon. But, if the specter of Iran and North Korea giving bombs to terrorists is reason enough for a deterrent, then every potential terrorist target ought to have nuclear weapons. In other words, everyone should. Faced with the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, hawks and doves from George Bush to Kofi Annan have concluded that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty needs rejuvenation. Eliminating Trident would not transform Mahmoud Ahmadinejad into a mensch. But disarmament - a striking action, brave for its clean break with past nuclear thinking - might catapult Britain to a position of moral leadership on nuclear issues, a position the Bush administration abdicated long ago. Used effectively, such leadership could breathe new life into the NPT, allowing us to finally stop thinking about what if, and start thinking about what next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
