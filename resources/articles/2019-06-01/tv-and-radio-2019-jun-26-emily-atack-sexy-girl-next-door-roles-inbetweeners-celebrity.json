Then my body became more womanly'", "bodyText": "Last summer, Emily Atack was, as she puts it, \u201cheartbroken, depressed, frustrated, bored\u201d. Her relationship had ended, and her last few films \u2013 Patrick, a live action Disney family comedy, and Lies We Tell, a crime thriller starring Harvey Keitel \u2013 had flopped. She was also broke. \u201cI needed a new path, and guidance,\u201d Atack says as she gazes out over the Thames from the balcony of a London hotel and sips a coffee. \u201cMoney and career aside, I didn\u2019t know who I was or where I belonged any more.\u201d After Atack\u2019s breakout role in the Bafta-winning E4 teen comedy The Inbetweeners, it seemed she would be for ever imprinted on the public imagination as her character Charlotte \u201cBig Jugs\u201d Hinchcliffe. The series ran from 2008 to 2010, after which she at first worked continuously, often cast in films as either a sex symbol (2014\u2019s Almost Married) or the girl next door (2016\u2019s Dad\u2019s Army). An attempt to rebrand herself as a serious actor had limited success. \u201cI\u2019m in a Disney film with Jennifer Saunders; no one\u2019s watching it.\u201d But Atack did have another option. She knew that the producers of I\u2019m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! wanted her on the show. They had already asked her to appear three times, and each time she had said no. Then, in 2018, when they came knocking again, Atack thought: why not? \u201cIn this business, if you want to survive, you\u2019ve got to recreate or re-brand yourself. I thought: OK, how about I start saying yes to a few things rather than saying no, and see what happens.\u201d The rest is history. Atack came second in the 18th series of the show, losing out to Harry Redknapp. Young, female viewers in particular took to her fun-loving attitude and struggles with body image. Her spell on the show cemented her place as Britain\u2019s collective big sister: the sort who drinks too much prosecco, tells filthy jokes and hoists up her dress to show you her Spanx. On leaving the jungle, Atack signed an endorsement deal with the online brand In The Style rumoured to be worth \u00a3500,000. In keeping with the body-positive message Atack espoused in the bush, the company pledged to stop airbrushing on its website. Atack has just completed a sold-out nationwide tour of her debut one-woman show Talk Thirty To Me, a mishmash of anecdotes about her wild party days, alongside heartfelt reflections on what it is to be a young woman in the public eye. A book, based loosely on the show\u2019s themes of turning 30 and loving yourself, will be released later this year. A documentary series, Emily Atack: Adulting, starts this week on W. One scene from Adulting features Atack having a fertility test, on screen. Like Atack, her ovaries are over-achievers. \u201cSixteen follicles!\u201d quips the doctor examining her. \u201cWell done you!\u201d (A follicle count of around 10 would be average.) Having a fertility test felt both reassuring, and also nerve-wracking, she says: \u201cWhen you look at your body like that on a screen, and you know the science of it all, you go: \u2018Right, OK, so in two years\u2019 time that will diminish.\u2019 You do need to think about it. The doctor even said to me: \u2018Well done for getting this checked out.\u2019\u201d Although viewers might struggle to understand Atack\u2019s concerns about her fertility at her age, she worries about it because most of her friends have already started having kids. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to be in the industry and not have kids right now, because everyone\u2019s very career-savvy. But because I don\u2019t surround myself with that, but with my mates I\u2019ve been hanging around with since I was 12, they\u2019re all doing the Bedfordshire baby thing. I think, should I be doing that?\u201d Atack comes from a show-business dynasty. Her mother, Kate Robbins, is a comedian best known for her work on the satirical show Spitting Image. Her father, Keith Atack, is a musician, and Paul McCartney is a relative. Growing up, famous friends of her parents were constantly around. She reminisces about popping over to Victoria Wood\u2019s house, and going to a Steps gig with Julie Walters and Dawn French. Despite her starry background, Atack is curiously classless in real life \u2013 you would never associate her with the other privileged scions of celebrity families. She attributes this to her parents\u2019 decision to send her to a state school. \u201cWe grew up very normal kids \u2013 I hate the word normal, because it makes it sound boring. I don\u2019t mean that. It was just a very suburban, ordinary school. I love my parents for not sending us to private school. I\u2019m still friends with all the people I went to school with now.\u201d Atack has very much branded herself as an ordinary woman, trying to make sense of a quarter-life crisis.It is a savvy move \u2013 who doesn\u2019t, approaching 30, sometimes feel lost? But I\u2019m not buying it. She doesn\u2019t look as if her life is a shambles. If anything, things are going superbly for the 29-year-old: her career is flying, and she is in a relationship with the film producer Rob Jowers. It is a remarkable turnaround, given where things were a year ago. Is she really as shambolic as she would have us believe? \u201cTo be honest, if I look at my life as a whole, it\u2019s in a million times better place than it was,\u201d she admits. \u201cSo in that sense, absolutely, I\u2019m getting it all together.\u201d It is easy to forget how long Atack has been in the business \u2013 she was 17 when she was cast in The Inbetweeners. She then became a regular fixture in lads\u2019 magazines \u2013 the covers are still hanging on her living room walls. \u201cI was getting all of these glamorous, sexy, girl-next-door-type roles, and that\u2019s great. I was all: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m sexy!\u2019 Posing in my pants. But you can\u2019t do that for ever. You especially can\u2019t do that, if \u2013 like me \u2013 you love going to the pub and you love Christmas Day dinners every weekend. The point is, my body was becoming way more womanly, and I wasn\u2019t looking like the girl next door any more.\u201d When the sexy ingenue roles started to dry up, Atack changed direction. \u201cI did this whole thing of going: \u2018I want to be taken seriously as an actor, I don\u2019t want to be this pin-uppy type any more, I\u2019m going to dye my hair brown and try and do that. I\u2019m an actor now. I\u2019m going to play police officers.\u2019\u201d It didn\u2019t work. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve cemented a vision in people\u2019s minds of what you are in the industry, that\u2019s the only way people see you.\u201d Meanwhile, light entertainment kept calling. \u201cI was knocking on all these doors, trying to get into a party I just wasn\u2019t invited to,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd then I had the party of light entertainment, going: \u2018You\u2019re invited! Come here!\u2019 And I\u2019d been saying: \u2018No, no no\u2019 for ages. And then I thought: You know what? This is the party I\u2019m going to go to, where I\u2019m invited, and where I can be the best version of myself that I can be.\u201d But persuading her agency that she was going to pause her acting career was a struggle. \u201cI had to be honest with them and just be like: \u2018Guys, I\u2019m not trying to be the next Keira Knightley. Let\u2019s stop banging on this door. We were aiming for the wrong target.\u2019\u201d For much of her career, Atack has been viciously harassed about her appearance online, so I\u2019m A Celebrity also offered the chance to have a digital detox. \u201cI\u2019ve got this opportunity to not have my phone and to not be anxious about social media, and not be called fat for a bit.\u201d Atack is candid about how loving her body in an industry that fetishises extreme thinness can still be a daily struggle. \u201cI so badly want to sit here and go: \u2018I love my body.\u2019 But I can\u2019t lie and say it doesn\u2019t upset me when I get called fat.\u201d In one telling moment from her new series, Atack admits to worrying about her weight 80% of the time. \u201cEven when I\u2019d left the jungle, and I had lost a stone and was feeling the best I\u2019d ever felt, I was still thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to keep this up.\u2019 If I wasn\u2019t in the industry and I just had a regular job, working in an office, I would probably love the way I look.\u201d Watching Atack\u2019s career go from strength to strength is satisfying, because she spent so long being the butt of the joke. \u201cI\u2019m still struggling to find my voice on panel shows,\u201d she says of her time as a guest on Celebrity Juice. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of sexism in it at times. People just don\u2019t really laugh at your jokes if you\u2019re the young girl on a panel show.\u201d She sees the standup tour, and her forthcoming book, as opportunities to prove her mettle. \u201cI\u2019ve got blonde hair and wear extensions and fake tan and false eyelashes. I\u2019ve always been judged for that \u2026 [I\u2019m] the punchline. And I\u2019ve just had enough. I wanted to prove you can have blonde hair, fake tan, false eyelashes, and still write about things, still know about things, still have decent things to say.\u201d Emily Atack: Adulting is on W on Wednesday at 10pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
