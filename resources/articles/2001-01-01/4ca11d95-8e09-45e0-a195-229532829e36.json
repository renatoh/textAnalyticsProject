The Jules Rimet Trophy, the Northern League championship trophy and the \"first World Cup\", the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, have all been carried off down the years. First to go was the original FA Cup. The \"little tin idol\" was snatched from the shop window of W Shillcock, a Birmingham boot-makers, in 1895 (\"It must not be forgotten,\" a Victorian humorist noted the following day, \"that even when stolen three times it does not become the property of the thief\"). Any contemporary smash-and-grab merchant hoping to repeat such a feat would be hard pressed indeed. Nowadays not only does the FA Cup zip about the country at a speed that would leave Michael Schumacher trailing in its wake, but barely a minute of its day goes unrecorded by the cameras. It is the Liz Hurley of sports prizes (though, admittedly, the star of Bedazzled has never been brandished above the head of an Essex meat porter in the middle of Smithfield Market. Well, not that we know of, anyway). Last week the most famous creation of the Bradford silversmiths Messrs Fattorini and Sons was tiresomely ubiquitous, photographed everywhere from Morecambe Bay to the Thames Barrier. Such was the Cup's rampant pursuit of publicity it was a surprise not to see it pop up on the campaign trail with Ehud Barak or at the wedding of Aled Jones. The days of cameo appearances on Friends and Star Trek Voyager are surely not far away. Once the FA Cup was treated in an altogether less starry fashion. Buried away for much of the year, it was often roughly handled when it did make an appearance. In 1980, for example, the then holders West Ham reportedly sent it to the BBC studios stuffed in a pillowcase in the back of a black cab. These days, though, PR is everything and the venerable trophy is on a media treadmill that would exhaust Madonna. Surprisingly the responsibility of ferrying it about falls to one man. I encountered this singular figure on a frosty evening several years ago at a non-League ground in northern England. The FA Cup was standing proudly by the entrance before an Axa banner, surrounded by a half a dozen fans, a television crew and a flock of those hyperactive, girning urchins who seem to follow TV cameras about as lapwings trail the plough. All was normal until a journalist moved to place an empty Styrofoam cup down on the table next to the silver trophy. \"Don't put that there,\" a deep and sonorous voice reprimanded him from the shadows. \"It will leave a ring on the velvet that will never come off.\" The speaker stepped into the glow of the floodlights. He was six feet in height with sleek dark hair and skin the colour and texture of a calf-skin catcher's mitt. Fans of 1980s soap operas could not but be reminded of Cecil Colby from Dynasty. \"Who are you, then?\" the journalist asked. \"I,\" the tall stranger explained gravely, \"am ... the Keeper of the Cup.\" \"Is that a full-time position, then?\" someone asked. The Keeper nodded. It seemed that he and the Cup were as inseparable as Martin Johnson's eyebrows. \"When I am finished here I will drive to Swansea,\" he replied. \"Probably breaking my journey at a Travelodge in the vicinity of Worcester.\" Sensing perhaps that this sounded a little less than glamorous, he added: \"I value the anonymity. I arrive after dark, park near the front entrance and slip swiftly inside with my overnight bag and, of course ...\" He nodded affectionately in the direction of his glimmering ward. \"I carry it in a plain wooden box,\" he said. Then he lowered his rich voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \"On occasion I have walked through vast crowds bearing the Cup and not a single person has had the slightest inkling that it was among them.\" The Keeper of the Cup's dedication and hard work are to be applauded, of course, but the concomitant publicity has to some minds at least stretched the magic of the Cup a little too thinly. No one would want the Cup to disappear into the midlands night as its predecessor did in 1895, but I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling that a few months out of the limelight would only add to its mystique. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
