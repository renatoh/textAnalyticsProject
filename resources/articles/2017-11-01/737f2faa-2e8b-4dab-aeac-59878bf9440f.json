But the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has reiterated his call for changes including allowing civil celebrants to reject weddings, ensuring charities are not adversely affected and protections for \u201cfreedom of speech and religion\u201d. On Friday Cormann told Sky News that he and immigration minister, Peter Dutton, are \u201cas one\u201d on the need for amendments and also supported his proposal that if religious freedom is not protected when the marriage law is changed it could be considered separately next year. Turnbull told 3AW that the bill, which was drafted by Liberal senator Dean Smith out of recommendations from a cross-party Senate committee, \u201cdoes not impose any restrictions on religious freedoms at all\u201d. \u201cAustralians practise their religions with freedom, as we always have done and always will,\u201d he said. Explaining the bill\u2019s provisions, Turnbull said churches and ministers of religion can refuse weddings, as they are able to now for any reason, and facilities owned by churches will be able to decline to service receptions. He said it made \u201cno change to anti-discrimination laws\u201d, adding that he \u201ctotally disagrees\u201d with Kevin Andrews statement that a Muslim baker should be able to refuse to provide services to a Jew. \u201cWe\u2019re not about to be creating new levels of discrimination,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think changes like that will actually be proposed in the debate.\u201d \u201cWhere it is unlawful to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation, in terms of a commercial relationship like that, you talked about a baker or a florist, that situation, that law is not affected by this bill.\u201d Turnbull said it was incumbent on those proposing amendments to \u201cset out precisely what they want to achieve\u201d. Asked if the postal survey had been hurtful, Turnbull said that \u201cpeople have said that\u201d and acknowledged \u201cif somebody says that they\u2019ve been hurt by the debate, then they\u2019ve been hurt\u201d. Turnbull said the debate had been \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d and had provided greater affirmation to LGBTI people than a parliamentary debate would have. \u201cIf you are a young gay person and you\u2019re worried about what your parents think, your friends think, isn\u2019t this a remarkable affirmation of love and respect?\u201d Turnbull noted that the biggest no votes in the survey were in areas with \u201clarge migrant populations\u201d, particularly those with \u201ca large Muslim population\u201d in western Sydney and Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou\u2019s seat in north-west Melbourne. Cormann told Sky he wanted to \u201cexpand protections for celebrants beyond religious celebrants\u201d, echoing an amendment proposed by the attorney general George Brandis, and to ensure that \u201ccharities are not adversely affected\u201d. The finance minister said he hoped some of the issues of \u201cfreedom of speech and religion\u201d would be reflected in the marriage law changes because they may be able to secure majority support with \u201ca lot of goodwill in the Senate, across the political spectrum\u201d. But he said other changes \u201cmay be a matter for another day\u201d. Cormann refused to say if a separate religious protection bill were initiated next year whether Coalition members would have a conscience vote, saying the question was \u201cgetting way ahead\u201d of the current debate and it may be that the marriage law changes satisfy everyone. On Thursday Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said that the opposition would \u201clook at the religious beliefs of celebrants\u201d to make sure that a marriage bill has \u201cno unintended consequences for them\u201d. Australian Marriage Equality co-chair, Alex Greenwich, said the yes campaign supported the bill in its current form and the amendment for celebrants to conscientiously object seems \u201cunnecessary\u201d. The director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre and co-chair of the Equality Campaign, Anna Brown, said the cross-party bill is already the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d in balancing the rights of marriage equality and religious freedom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
