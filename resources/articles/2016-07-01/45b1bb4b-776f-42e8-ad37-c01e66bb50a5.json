She delivered the warning at press conferences with the Slovakian prime minister in Bratislava and then the Polish prime minister in Warsaw, as she continued her tour of European capitals to lay the foundations for leaving the European Union. The EU has banned member states from negotiating over Brexit until the UK triggers article 50 of the Lisbon treaty starting the divorce process. But May has visited six European leaders in the last eight days, as No 10 tries to work out whether it is feasible to keep free trade with the rest of the EU while curbing free movement of people. At the event in Bratislava, May spelled out that the UK\u2019s deal with the EU will have to take into account voters\u2019 views on immigration control. However, Robert Fico, the Slovakian leader, said the \u201cperception British voters have\u201d of EU migration was \u201cslightly different to how we perceive migration on the continent\u201d. May repeated that message in Warsaw, saying the voters had sent a \u201cvery clear message that they do not want free movement to continue as it has in the past\u201d. In response, Beata Szyd\u0142o, the Polish prime minister, stressed that Poland sees the free movement of people as a key issue. \u201cAny arrangement between the European Union and the United Kingdom in the future regarding freedom of movement is likely to be the most important part of the negotiations between both parties,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will not be easy. But I think both for Britain and the EU it is very important that this issue \u2013 one of the four freedoms of the internal market \u2013 is saved.\u201d May also repeated her position that Polish and Slovakian workers in the UK will have their right to remain preserved only if UK citizens enjoy those same rights in Poland and Slovakia. The prime minister said: \u201cWe value the contribution that Poles have made to the UK. While we are a member there will be no changes. It is important that we see the rights of British people in other EU countries as also being respected. We also want to get the right deal for goods and services.\u201d The Polish prime minister appeared to have accepted May\u2019s overarching position that citizens\u2019 rights should be reciprocal after Brexit. However, the reference was vague and neither leader specified whether they were referring to movement, residency or benefit access. Szyd\u0142o said: \u201cIt is for us to negotiate to ensure the rights of Polish citizens in the UK and those of UK citizens in the European Union be maintained.\u2019\u2019 At both events, May stressed that she is keen for the UK to have its own distinct relationship with the EU rather than an \u201coff the shelf\u201d model previously negotiated with other nations such as Norway or Switzerland. \u201cWe should be driven by what is in the best interests of the UK and what is going to work for the European Union, not by the models that already exist,\u201d she told the news conference in Bratislava. \u201cWe need to find a solution that addresses the concerns of the British people about free movement while getting the best possible deal on trade in goods and services.\u201d This indicates that she is hoping her new minister for Brexit, David Davis, will be able to strike a bespoke deal that manages a balance between controlling free movement and preserving free trade. However, anything less than an end to free movement that sees EU citizens treated in the same way as citizens from the rest of the world is unlikely to satisfy the most hardline pro-Brexit MPs in the Conservative party and activists in Ukip. The task of negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world has been given to Liam Fox, the new trade secretary, who has been in the US attempting to initiate talks. However, the US has said it is difficult to begin meaningful discussions until the UK is out of the EU. Fox was also overruled by No 10 when he suggested the UK could leave the customs union, subsequently stressing that no decision had been taken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
