In the suit, Elizabeth Rose, a former project manager in Vice\u2019s Los Angeles office, alleges that men she worked with earned much more than her female colleagues. She said a man she had hired was earning $25,000 a year more than she was. Later, when he was promoted to be her supervisor, the suit says, a Vice executive told Rose that the colleague was a \u201cgood personality fit\u201d for male clients. Michael Morrison, a Santa Monica attorney who filed the lawsuit today on Rose\u2019s behalf, said: \u201cYou would just be floored.\u201d Morrison said: \u201cShe hired someone who made more than her, who was essentially groomed to be her supervisor. What greater form of discrimination and oppression than paying someone less for their services because of their sex?\u201d The lawsuit also alleges that a female editor hired in the company\u2019s Los Angeles office was offered $15,000 less than a male editor hired in Brooklyn. According to the lawsuit, Michael Prommer, a former Vice manager, when asked about the discrepancy, allegedly replied: \u201cThis is how much we can offer her.\u201d Vice said it was reviewing the lawsuit. It said: \u201cAs a company, we have made a significant commitment to a respectful, inclusive and equal workplace.\u201d A recent New York Times article on Vice detailed allegations of unwanted kissing, groping, and termination for some employees who rejected their superiors\u2019 sexual advances. The Times piece came in the context of the #MeToo movement, which has unearthed systematic sexual harassment and assault in a number of industries, including the news media. In response to the allegations first reported by the Times, Vice admitted: \u201cFrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201d Vice\u2019s response was included in the lawsuit as evidence of the company\u2019s \u201csystematic, company-wide, unlawful treatment of [Rose] and hundreds of similarly situated employees\u201d. Morrison, Rose\u2019s lawyer, said: \u201cEven after the New York Times article came out, people can\u2019t tell what Vice has actually done \u2013 besides lip service \u2013 to make changes. It\u2019s time to hold them accountable.\u201d News of the lawsuit quickly provoked discussion about Vice on social media, with several former female employees posting about their experiences. One former employee, Kayla Ruble, told the Guardian she had experienced the kind of pay discrimination alleged in the suit, and described working at Vice as \u201can intense environment of misogyny\u201d. She said that her experience had made her think \u201cmaybe I\u2019m not worth it\u201d. Ruble, who left Vice in 2016, said she wasn\u2019t sure if her experience would qualify her for inclusion in the suit, but was thinking of contacting Morrison\u2019s law firm. She said she knew of other female Vice employees were thinking of doing the same. About two hours after the lawsuit was reported, Morrison said, several women had contacted his law firm, ready to talk about their own pay disparity grievances with Vice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
