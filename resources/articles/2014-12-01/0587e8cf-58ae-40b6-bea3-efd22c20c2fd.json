Balotelli is facing a possible two-match ban, although most likely a fine, after being charged by the FA for posting an image of the Nintendo character Super Mario that prompted accusations of racism and antisemitism. The Liverpool striker attracted criticism for reposting an Instagram image on Monday that included the sentence \u201cjumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew\u201d underneath the cartoon character with whom he shares a nickname. The 24-year-old quickly deleted the image and, having denied the accusations of racism and antisemitism on Twitter, pointing out that his foster mother is Jewish, issued an apology for any offence caused.Balotelli submitted observations on the incident to the FA on Friday, in which he detailed examples of the racist abuse he has suffered during a high-profile career with Internazionale, Manchester City, Milan and Liverpool. However, he was subsequently charged by the governing body under rule E3, which cites as \u201caggravating factors\u201d references to ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality, faith, gender, sexual orientation or disability. The charge adds to the striker\u2019s difficulties at Liverpool, where he has made an inauspicious start since arriving from Milan for \u00a316m in the summer, but he is unlikely to part company with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team in the forthcoming transfer window. Daniel Sturridge\u2019s injury problems have reduced Liverpool\u2019s attacking options this season and his fitness is one reason Balotelli may not be offloaded at the first opportunity. Another is a lack of interest in the Italy international, who has not scored in the Premier League for Liverpool in nine appearances and struggled to integrate into Rodgers\u2019 team. The striker has been linked with a January loan move back to Internazionale, and a reunion with the former City manager Roberto Mancini, but there has been no contact between the clubs. Balotelli, who signed a three-year contract containing behavioural clauses with Liverpool in August, has missed the team\u2019s last four matches with a groin injury and will again be absent when Sunderland visit Anfield in the Premier League day. The FA confirmed: \u201cIt is alleged the Liverpool player breached FA Rule E3 (1) in that his posting was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper. It is further alleged that this is an \u2018Aggravated Breach\u2019 as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief. The player has until 6pm on 15 December 2014 to respond to the charge.\u201d A regulatory commission will meet within 10 days of receiving Balotelli\u2019s response to consider the case. The striker could be banned for one match if he accepts the charge and two games should he contest it. The latter appears likely given the observations Balotelli submitted to the FA, although a fine and a warning \u2013 not a ban \u2013 is the more common punishment for social media hearings. Rio Ferdinand, for example, was fined \u00a345,000 in 2012 for a tweet that characterised Ashley Cole as a \u201cchoc ice\u201d. A Liverpool spokesperson said: \u201cWe acknowledge the FA\u2019s decision and the player will work through the process to answer the charge. While that process is ongoing the club will not be making any further comment.\u201d Rodgers, meanwhile, has praised Raheem Sterling for his reaction to the collective warning that the Liverpool manager issued to the squad following their miserable defeat at Crystal Palace almost a fortnight ago. Liverpool are seeking a hat-trick of league wins against Sunderland for the first time since April having responded well to the 3-1 reverse at Selhurst Park with Sterling, who turns 20 on Monday, instrumental. \u201cI spoke to a lot of individuals, and to the group, and said that our standards needed to improve,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cThat was us all. For Raheem it is about realising what those standards are and for him that is being direct, quick, aggressive and pressing the ball really hard. And in the last two games he\u2019s been good at that. At 19, nearly 20, I think he\u2019s shown he has gone to an extra level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
