They most certainly aren't tough working animals, which is precisely what your dog is intended to be in Fable 2, the forthcoming title from relentlessly inventive British studio Lionhead. Sequel to a game that very slightly overreached on its ambition to let your character develop depending on your good or evil behaviour, this version gives you a dog that evolves in your image, turning into a gentle collie or savage pitbull depending on the treatment you mete out to those who cross your path, and helping with everything from finding buried treasure to biting interlopers. The Fable 2 dog is already looking alarmingly endearing in its love, devotion and eagerness to serve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
