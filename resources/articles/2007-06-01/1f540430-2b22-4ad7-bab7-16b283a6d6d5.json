I know some of the guys who worked on the music compositions for the original PC classics, and they say that it is currently being planned amidst rumors. However, LucasArts has so many things on its belt right now, including a Wii title that has yet to be named. Don't expect any revitalizations of its classic graphic adventures until 2008 at the earliest.\" Then a couple of days later, veteran LucasArts illustrator, Steve Purcell, emailed Monkey fansite Worldofmi.com with some new artwork, claiming that it was, \"in no way connected to any existing or canceled piratey project.\" Was he hinting that the three images came from a new Monkey project? It would be a wishful but not entirely unreasonable leap of logic. I'm partially excited by this, but that excitement is tempered by two factors: the sheer vagueness of these rumours and the relative mediocrity of all the Monkey Island titles after LeChuck's Revenge. Personally, I'm still holding out for a DS, PSP, iPod or mobile phone compilation of the first two titles - complete and unabridged. Then I'd like Maniac Mansion and Sam &amp; Max. And possibly Full Throttle. Although you can keep The Dig."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
