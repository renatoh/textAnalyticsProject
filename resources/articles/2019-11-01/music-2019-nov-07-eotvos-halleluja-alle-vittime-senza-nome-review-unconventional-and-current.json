It\u2019s built around the historical figure of Notker Balbulus, Notker the Stammerer, a ninth-century Benedictine monk who was a chronicler and composer. But, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s insists, \u201cIt is not so much a portrait of Notker as of the times in which we live \u2026 At first the choir represents a society that says \u2018hallelujah\u2019 to everything: they have to be satisfied with everything. But they become increasingly critical and defiant.\u201d This is not, then, a conventional oratorio in any sense, but a wry, often cynical riff on the form, which never takes itself totally seriously. As well as the chorus, there are three soloists \u2013 a throaty mezzo-soprano Angel, a tenor representing the stuttering prophet, who wants to predict the future without knowing whether there will be one, and a narrator, whose interventions provide a guide to the four \u201cfragments\u201d into which the 50-minute work is divided, and which are interrupted by brief contemporary \u201cscenes\u201d. The texts are clear enough, but the babble of modern life is conveyed in the music, with its patchwork of quotations ranging from Gregorian chant to pastiche Bart\u00f3k, via Monteverdi and Schein, Bach and Handel, Mozart and Bruckner. \u201cHistory passes before our ears\u201d, writes E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, \u201c \u2026 the cultural stew has become extremely thin.\u201d The theme of Schumann\u2019s Prophet Bird, from his Op 82 Waldszenen, opens and and closes this richly fascinating score, though for a work in which words, both spoken and sung, play such an important role, it\u2019s a disgrace that Wergo\u2019s fine recording, with Iris Vermillion, Topi Lehtipuu and Matthias Brandt as the soloists, does not includes Esterh\u00e1zy\u2019s German text and translations in the sleeve notes; if the spoken words of the narrator are clear enough, those of the singers are certainly not, and a whole layer of the piece stays out of reach. After the polyglot uncertainties of Halleluja, Alle Vittime senza Nome is a much more straightforward memorial, commissioned by three Italian orchestras in 2016; the recording comes from live performances by Antonio Pappano\u2019s superb Accademia Santa Cecilia players. Its three movements of increasing length are \u201cmeant to remind us of the many Arab and African people who have climbed into overcrowded boats with dreams of reaching a better life, only to drown in the waters of the Mediterranean off the coast of Italy\u201d. It\u2019s a work built on melodies, some with a vaguely Middle Eastern tang, some more frankly elegiac, and switching between frantic activity and motionless quiet. The gently chiming ending is also a memorial to P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy, who died just before the premiere of Halleluja, bringing the disc full circle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
