That should have been 1917 (\u2018It was still and misty and I could taste their blood in the air\u2019, 1 August, page 10, early editions). \u2022 In Monday\u2019s paper, an editorial about Brexit said the Passchendaele commemoration was being held in Mons. In fact it was held in Ypres (Who is running Brexit policy, Mrs May \u2013 you or the chancellor, 31 July, page 22). A feature about the battle said Ypres was known as \u201cLeper to the Belgians\u201d. The Belgian name for the city is Ieper (I died in hell - they called it Passchendaele, 31 July, page 1, early editions). And a letter misspelled the poet Ellis Humphrey Evans\u2019s parents farm, Yr Ysgwrn, as Yr Ysgwyrn (The tragedies of Ypres remembered, 31 July, page 24). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Israel refuses to remove metal detectors from mosque despite rising violence Gay bars and tarot cards: Liverpool show celebrates LGBT art"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
