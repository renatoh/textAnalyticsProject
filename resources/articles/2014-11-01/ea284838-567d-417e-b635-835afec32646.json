Even before Friday\u2019s disaster in the skies above the Mojave desert, in which the Virgin Galactic test craft SpaceShipTwo was destroyed and one of the test pilots, 39-year-old Michael Alsbury, killed, this was a project marked by bad luck and near-calamity. Five years ago, as Branson was declaring SpaceShipTwo to be \u201cthe sexiest spaceship ever\u201d at an unveiling at the Mojave air and space port, howling winds, sleet and near-freezing temperatures reduced the invited glitterati \u2013 politicians, actors, glamour women and some of the world\u2019s top aerospace engineers \u2013 to human icicles. Barely 20 minutes after they abandoned their vodka cocktails and champagne, the heavy tent sheltering them on the runway collapsed. It was pure luck the structure did not succumb sooner and endanger a lot of people. Branson put a brave face on then and he was forced to do so again on Saturday as he flew into Mojave to reassure his large team of engineers that the commercial space tourism project \u201cdream\u201d would live on. The Virgin boss was wearing his trademark open-neck white shirt and black jacket, but the casual confidence of his delivery before the news cameras could not mask a deep hesitation about a project that has already seen several deadlines missed and whose cost has ballooned to more than $1bn (\u00a3626m). \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that all 400 engineers who work here and indeed most people in the world would love to see the dream living on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe it to our test pilots to find out what went wrong, and once we find out what went wrong, if we can overcome it, we will make absolutely certain that the dream lives on.\u201d That \u201cif\u201d was a big one. Roughly one-third of Branson\u2019s seed money has come from a single source, the Aabar investment fund in Abu Dhabi, which will now have to think seriously whether it is realistic to expect a space tourism hub in the Arabian Gulf in the near future, as it had been hoping. The loss of SpaceShipTwo means that Branson\u2019s dream of boarding a test flight himself early next year has now been shattered. It is too early to say if a new test craft will be built, how long it will take, or how much it will cost. For now, the process is entirely out of the tycoon\u2019s hands. It will be up to the National Transportation Safety Board, the US agency tasked with investigating crashes of any commercial transport carrier, to determine the cause and to let the space engineers and the investors know if the problem is an easy fix or something that will send them all back to the drawing board. The NTSB has some experience with spacecraft \u2013 it was involved in both the Challenger space shuttle crash in 1986 and the Columbia crash in 2003 \u2013 but will have to learn about SpaceShipTwo as it goes along. The NTSB\u2019s acting chairman, Christopher Hart, told reporters as he landed in Mojave that he did not yet know if SpaceShipTwo had a black box flight recorder. Accounts of what happened on Friday morning are necessarily murky and unreliable at this stage. We know this was the first test flight in nine months. We know Virgin Galactic had been forced to abandon a previous rubber-based fuel compound because it did not deliver the required performance and was trying out a new plastic-based compound for the first time on a live flight. Some reports suggest that Friday\u2019s test flight was delayed for an hour or two because of concerns about the fuel\u2019s temperature. At about 10.30am SpaceShipTwo and its mothership, WhiteKnightTwo, took off. Shortly after they separated, about 40 minutes, later SpaceShipTwo suffered what Virgin Galactic has described as \u201ca serious anomaly\u201d, and broke up at 45,000 feet. Alsbury\u2019s co-pilot, Peter Siebold, 43, ejected from SpaceShipTwo and parachuted to the ground. He suffered several injuries in the crash and was being treated at Antelope Valley hospital, the sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement. Alsbury, a father-of-two, was not so lucky. The wreckage of SpaceShipTwo was strewn on either side of a railway track about 22 miles north of Mojave. Deputies from the local sheriff\u2019s department secured the scene pending the arrival of the NTSB investigators. Both pilots worked for Virgin Galactic\u2019s partner company, Scaled Composites, which is based at the Mojave air and space port. The pilots, who wear distinctive green and blue uniforms, are a fixture in the tiny town not far from Edwards air force base and the tragedy plunged much of Mojave into mourning. The accident was too far away to hear, but cafes and restaurants along Mojave\u2019s main drag realised something was up when nobody showed up for what is usually a crowded lunch hour. \u201cIt was eerie, just an eerie feeling,\u201d said Carlos Davila, who runs the Old Desert Caf\u00e9. Branson has cut an unmistakably glamorous figure in this town and his promise of space travel within reach of anyone \u2013 albeit with $250,000 to spare for a ticket \u2013 never lacked for PR panache. His timetable, however, has always seemed wildly over-optimistic. At SpaceShipTwo\u2019s unveiling, Branson talked about commercial flights beginning as early as 2011. Last year, he applied to begin a rigorous 18-month testing process with the Federal Aviation Authority only to stop the clock once it became clear the fuel compound still needed work. Despite the problems, Virgin Galactic says 800 people have already put down deposits on a ticket, including pop bad-boy Justin Bieber and actor Ashton Kutcher. The town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, meanwhile, has invested more than $200m in public funds to start work on the space port from which VirginGalactic\u2019s commercial flights would blast off. All of that is now in doubt. \u201cSpace is hard,\u201d the chief executive of Virgin Galactic, George Whitesides, acknowledged after the accident. Branson said much the same: \u201cWe do understand the risks involved and we\u2019re not going to push on blindly. To do so would be an insult to those affected by this tragedy. We\u2019re going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance, and then move forwards together.\u201d Assuming, of course, the future can be salvaged at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
