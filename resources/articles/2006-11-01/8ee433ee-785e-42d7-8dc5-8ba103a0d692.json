Perhaps it's something to do with dentistry. Though that wouldn't explain why Radiohead made it in America first. Perhaps it's to do with banal MOR melodies - which would explain Bush, but not M-Tina, the singer who's No 2 in the US R&amp;B chart and coming straight outta Gorton. M-Tina, real name Martina John, recorded her single Submerge in a bedroom in Sale (why is it always a bedroom? Does musical creativity not flow as well in the kitchen?). With her boyfriend Scott - street name White N3RD - on production, it was destined for UK obscurity. But then Martina's family went on holiday in the US, bumped into a producer, played him the track, persuaded him to act on their behalf, got a record deal and found their song selling more copies than the Pussycat Dolls (for that relief, much thanks). Now everyone wants to know M-Tina's name - though they could just add an A and an R and they'd be there - and more success seems likely to follow. \"We have had a lot of attention from major labels since this has happened,\" she told the Manchester Evening News. \"But I can't see me driving up Deansgate in a limo just yet.\" A sign of appealing modesty which will surely wear off by their third single. But what does M-Tina's success teach us about cracking the US? 1 Remove letters from your name if you want to be noticed. 2 Make R&amp;B - Americans like that. 3 Whatever you do, never holiday anywhere else. You might pass up an invaluable A&amp;R opportunity. Britney Update 1: The Sun has exclusively bought from elsewhere some photographs of the soon-to-be-single singer ice-skating. According to Britney, she did this \"to show everybody I'm fine on my own\", though this message would have been more convincing if she hadn't spent half the time clinging to her manager, Larry Rudolph, in an attempt to keep her balance. Britney Update 2: The Mirror claims that K-Fed (remember him?) learned he was to be dumped by La Spears via text message. It claims a reality TV show crew, thank God they were around, caught a distinct change of mood in the \"rapper\" after he received a message last Saturday night. Which seems like a good piece of detective work, though at this stage it remains possible that the message was actually from a friend conveying the simple message: \"U hv fce lk weasel LOL!\" Pete Doherty finally felt the full force of the law yesterday, being fined \u00a3250 and left with \u00a3200 court costs for kicking a microphone out of the hand of a Radio 1 reporter. The only thing was, being the Victorian street urchin that he is, Doherty came out of the house with only 27p in his pocket (it's five and two in old money!) and was unable to settle his debt. Though you can be sure there was some 19-year-old from the shires hanging around outside who would be perfectly willing to help out should the need arise..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
