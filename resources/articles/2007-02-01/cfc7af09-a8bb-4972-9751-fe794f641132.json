In probing the character of the eponymous hero, driven murderously insane for love of the capricious Angelica, the opera asks whether destiny derives from some externally imposed force or whether it is the product of irrational elements within the human psyche. Much of the narrative is refracted through the eyes of the magician-philosopher Zoroastro, whose interventions pre-empt the alienation effects of Brechtian theatre. The resolution, in which self-knowledge is seen as alleviating mental instability, prefigures modern psychotherapy. All this should make the work a gift to an intelligent director, though Francisco Negrin's production, first seen in 2003, is a messy affair that dumps the opera somewhere between rococo frippery and surrealist phantasmagoria. The opening - in which Zorosastro (Kyle Ketelsen) summons the symbolic figures of Mars, Venus and Eros - is quite striking. So are the final scenes, in which Negrin's use of false endings suggests multiple resolutions to the opera's narrative, rather than a clear-cut close. In between, however, comes a lot of pretentious drivel. Bejun Mehta's Orlando pursues Angelica (Rosemary Joshua) and her lover Medoro (Anna Bonitatibus) through a forest of phallic lances, as a baleful moon, suggesting lunacy, swings overhead. There are allusions to 18th-century painting, inconsistently deployed. Joshua is first seen in a copy of the frock worn by the unnamed woman in Fragonard's The Swing. The set derives from the landscapes of Poussin and Claude Lorrain. It gets trashed as the performance progresses, and towards the end, the stage looks as if someone has committed some dreadful act of vandalism in the Wallace Collection. Yet you need to see it, primarily because Mehta gives an unforgettable, powerhouse performance in the title role. A ballsy, risk-taking singer, he flings coloratura about like weaponry and pushes himself to his limits in his quest for musical and dramatic expression. You are conscious of being in the presence of greatness. There's some fine singing elsewhere, too, above all from Bonitatibus, who is very noble and eloquent. Charles Mackerras's conducting is swiftly elegant, though it will not appeal to those who like their Handel oozing sensuality. \u00b7 Until March 13.
