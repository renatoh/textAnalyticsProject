Still, we see this as a massive opportunity that would never have come about from regular funding streams.\u201d Jones\u2019s charity works across the Midlands to help teenagers at risk of being exploited by gangs. The St Giles Trust was awarded \u00a3285,000 from the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, following its successful bid for the Home Office\u2019s early intervention youth fund (EIYF) funding for a one-year pilot to pay for specialist youth workers to identify and support young victims and perpetrators of serious violence in hospitals. St Giles also received funding to bring home Londoners arrested for dealing drugs in other parts of the county through so-called county lines networks \u2013 a drug distribution system in which criminals exploit thousands of predominantly 15\u2011 to 17-year-olds who are often groomed and forced to funnel hard drugs from cities to towns and rural regions across the country. Police have now identified around 2,000 drug supply chains as part of the county lines network, which is fuelling knife crime as rival gangs clash, while a majority of police forces say it is also linked to an increase in gun crime. A \u00a33.6m National County Lines Coordination Centre, jointly run by the National Crime Agency and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, opened last September. It aims to improve intelligence on county lines across forces and improve safeguarding, while better protecting victims. During a single week in late May, police targeting county lines gangs arrested about 600 people suspected of involvement in drug dealing following operations coordinated by the centre. But with almost one in 10 people in the UK taking drugs in the last year, and the number of 14- to 18-year-olds convicted for possession with intent to supply in England and Wales rising by more than two-thirds in five years, there are growing calls for a different approach. Leaving a county lines gang is often dangerous, but by \u201cbeing there and really sticking by that young person\u2019s side\u201d, St Giles says it gives people a fighting chance to avoid being lured \u2013 or forced \u2013 back into a life of crime. In Coventry and Wolverhampton, the charity\u2019s caseworkers \u2013 often former gang members \u2013 will sit at the bedside of young people, predominantly boys, who have been stabbed to offer them support and guidance. Many have been involved in gang feuds, sometimes drug-related, and are extremely vulnerable. They provide intensive support, liaising with families and carers as well as police, courts and youth-offending teams, and accompanying the young person to appointments. Although the charity\u2019s Midlands project is one of just under 30 initiatives that successfully bid for EIYF funding from the Home Office, more than 80 bids endorsed by elected police chiefs across England and Wales were rejected. With average funding cuts of 19% since 2010, police forces say they lack the resources to tackle county lines effectively without extra funding. Ron Hogg, PCC for the north-east region, which had its bid for EIYF money to tackle county lines rejected, says this is a false economy. \u201cWe feel we are being punished for being efficient,\u201d says Hogg. \u201cBut we do not have enough money \u2013 we have had a 32% real-terms funding reduction in government grant since 2010, and we are one of the forces very heavily dependent on it. \u201cI think there is an awful lot more youth drug dealing and county lines activity going in our area than we are aware of, and, fundamentally, we need a longer-term vision to get on top of it and address the causes, such as the lack of youth services.\u201d Hogg, a Labour PCC and former senior police officer, has been outspoken in his calls for drug policy reform. \u201cThe evidence from Portugal \u2013 where the drug-induced death rate is now almost 30 times lower than in north-east England \u2013 speaks for itself, but the government is not listening,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of the UK\u2019s drug problem, we need to address the underlying causes of drug taking.\u201d Durham is one of a number of police forces diverting low-level drug offenders away from the criminal justice system and towards education and treatment through its \u201ccheckpoint scheme\u201d. And there are calls to ensure that children groomed and forced into a life of crime through county lines are not criminalised, but instead treated as victims and given reprieves. A senior police officer who wanted to remain anonymous said: \u201cUnless the market is tackled, then drug-running will continue. One of the most complex areas for policing county lines is whether to manage a child as a victim or as a suspect. In my view, they are mostly victims but others will see the same case differently.\u201d A Home Office spokeswoman says: \u201cWe are determined to crack down on county lines, disrupt the networks devastating communities, and put an end to the violence and exploitation of children and vulnerable adults. \u201cEnding this kind of violence requires long-term thinking, and, over 10 years, our \u00a3200m youth endowment fund will support the public health approach to tackling serious violence by supporting at-risk children and young people.\u201d Critics point out that this cannot compensate for swingeing cuts to services that help prevent youth crime. The Local Government Association warned in May that the Ministry of Justice was \u201cseriously undermining\u201d work to prevent young people from getting involved in knife crime and county lines drug dealing, since councils had not been told how much money they will receive from the MoJ to tackle youth offending \u2013 more than two months after they had to set their budgets. Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board, says: \u201cFaced with significant rises in demand for urgent child protection work and a \u00a33.1bn funding gap facing children\u2019s services by 2025, councils are being forced to divert the limited funding they have left away from preventive work, including youth-offending teams and youth work, into services to protect children who are at immediate risk of harm.\u201d The shadow policing and crime minister, Louise Haigh, says: \u201cYou simply cannot tackle the root causes of youth violence unless you commit in the long-term to helping overcome the drivers of youth violence with an evidence-based approach.\u201d Nikki Holland, county lines lead and director of investigations at the National Crime Agency, said: \u201cWe know that criminal networks use high levels of violence, exploitation and abuse to ensure compliance from the vulnerable people they employ to do the day-to-day drug supply activity. Thanks to the hard work of law enforcement officers there are now fewer drugs on the streets, more vulnerable people safeguarded and the public can be reassured that, collectively, we are committed to tackling serious and organised crime offenders and safeguarding victims.\u201d Caseworkers have just safely returned an extremely vulnerable 21-year-old woman to Wales after she was suspected of having been trafficked away from home and forced to be a drug mule. She was arrested in possession of class A drugs along with three other men, with whom she had had sex, and during a police chase was made to hide their drugs in her hair. After being referred to the charity by the courts, she was helped to find accommodation, reclaim her possessions, and will have ongoing support to prevent further abuse and exploitation. \u201cIf she had not had a trusted individual to be her advocate with the authorities and ensure safeguarding measures were put in place, then she may have been further harmed,\u201d says a spokeswoman from St Giles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
