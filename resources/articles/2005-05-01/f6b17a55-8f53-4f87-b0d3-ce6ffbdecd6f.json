As Baby Mario plummets through the vertically-scrolling sky, you have to draw lines of little fluffy clouds, steering him away from enemies and towards coins. Then, in the platform-style, side-scrolling stages, you draw clouds to guide egg-firing dinosaur Yoshi across the landscape as he gallops off with Baby Mario on his back. In either type of level, circling enemies with clouds produces balloons which can be flung at Baby Mario for bonuses. If you mess up, you can clear the clouds by blowing into the handheld's microphone. There's a little bit more to the game than that, but not much. Yoshi Touch &amp; Go is simple game of anticipation and reaction, and it's lots of fun. \u00b7 Nintendo, \u00a330 Enthusia Professional Racing Playstation 2 Like that certain other PS2-based racing simulation, Enthusia offers indestructible licensed cars (a mere 200 or so here), realistic handling, a mixture of city, circuit and off-road races, and even driving school-style challenges. The designers are clearly proud of the physics engine - so proud, in fact, that they've included a visual inertia and tyre pressure guide. Unfortunately, the game's chassis is a little broken - you're docked points for not only coming off the track and hitting cars, but also when other cars hit you, which seems grossly unfair. Also, game progression is based on an over-complicated ranking system, while new cars are awarded in post-race raffles. All very odd. Still, it's not like you've finished Gran Turismo 4 yet, is it? \u00b7 Konami, \u00a340 SingStar Popworld Playstation 2 Our neighbours greet the arrival of a new SingStar game with the kind of enthusiasm normally reserved for scaffolders or road workers. For the uninitiated, it's a brilliant karaoke game which rates your performance accordingly to pitch, tone and timing. Plug in an EyeToy camera and you can look stupid, too. SingStar Party added a duet mode and pass-the-mic party games to the original formula. This one goes a little further with a medley option and a rap scoring feature, but little else has changed - the tie-in with Popworld just adds an intro featuring Simon and Miquita. The mixture of recent hits and classic songs should please everyone - except those neighbours. \u00b7 Sony, \u00a320 (\u00a340 with two microphones)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
