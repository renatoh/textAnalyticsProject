In many cases this is due to the limitations imposed by many policy terms. For instance, many pets are turned down as being too old, and many policies will not cover animals over the age of seven. Pets rehomed from a rescue centre will also be excluded by many policies (this is because 'their pre vious medical history or actual age cannot be verified', according to Sainsbury's). While vet's fees account for 90 per cent of claims, there are limits as low as \u00a3500 on the amount payable to cover them. Sainsbury's says that its own policy 'is designed to offer some of the widest range of benefits available at a competitive price'.
