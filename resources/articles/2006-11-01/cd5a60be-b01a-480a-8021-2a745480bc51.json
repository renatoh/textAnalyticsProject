Last week, just as the newspaper industry was digesting a gloomy report showing that decline in circulations is growing ever steeper, there were signs that several of the nation's most prominent publicly owned but struggling newspapers may soon return to private ownership. Indeed, there are signs that even in an age of instant electronic news, newspapers themselves are still desirable acquisitions for a new generation of old-school, would-be media barons. Last week, 'Neutron Jack' Welch, the formidable former head of GE, said he was looking to buy the Boston Globe from the New York Times. In Los Angeles, David Geffen, the former music manager and entertainment industry dealmaker, moved closer to making a bid for the struggling LA Times in a partnership with the property and supermarket billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle. In New York, the family that controls the New York Times is under pressure to reform the ownership structure of the company to give more control to shareholders. Prominent businessmen in Baltimore and Connecticut are also looking to acquire papers in their cities. The timing is not accidental: in terms of circulation and revenue, US newspapers are in crisis. Average daily circulation across 770 newspapers dropped nearly 3 per cent in the last year. The LA Times, owned by the Tribune Company of Chicago, reported the single largest decline - of 8 per cent, to about 750,000 daily copies. In September, Tribune said it would consider takeover bids. These having fallen short of $8bn, it is now considering a break-up and the sale of individual titles. The gloom and doom extends far further. The Philadelphia Inquirer, which has changed hands twice in the past year, lost 7.6 per cent of its circulation to 330,000 copies; the Boston Globe was down 6.7 per cent; the Wall Street Journal, the nation's second largest paper, was down 1.9 per cent to just over 2 million; the New York Times, which has seen its market value decrease by half in four years, saw its circulation fall 3.5 per cent to just over 1 million. Only New York's two daily tabloids, the Post and the Daily News, saw circulation gains. Rupert Murdoch's energetic Post, up 5 per cent, is now the nation's fifth largest daily, ahead of the Washington Post, which fell 3.3 per cent to 656,000. Analysts of the industry say that while newspapers adjust to the economics - or lack thereof - of the internet, the era of public ownership may be drawing to an end. Last year Knight Ridder, once one of the largest US newspaper groups, was broken up and Tribune may follow suit. But although taking US papers back into private hands may confer status on their new proprietors, private ownership is no guarantee of success. Mort Zuckerman, owner of the New York Daily News, has seen his paper, once far larger and more profitable than the Post, slowly lose ground to its cross-town rival. Many may aspire to be Citizen Kane, but few make it. In Santa Barbara, Wendy McCaw, ex-wife of cellphone billionaire Craig McCaw, has turned her Santa Barbara News-Press into a champion of animal rights, arguing against a government-funded pig hunt on nearby islands in the Pacific. Philip Anschutz, of Millennium Dome/John Prescott fame, currently owns the San Francisco, Washington and Baltimore Examiners, which, according to media critic Jack Shafer, serve little function 'beyond creating new forms of litter'. If Geffen gains control of the LA Times, he has already indicated he would accept lower margins and probably reduce the paper's national and international aspirations in favour of concentrating on local issues. Mirroring America's bi-coastal sensitivities, the paper has long suffered from a sense of intellectual inferiority to its east coast counterparts. As a matter of prestige, the Chandler family, one-time owners of the LA Times, kept open a web of global bureaus and printed an east coast edition to maintain the illusion of Washington influence long after even Los Angelenos switched to the New York Times for that kind of information. The paper's condition is singularly representative of what ails the US newspaper business. The sole broadsheet in a large, racially and economically diverse metropolis, it had a daily circulation of 1.2 million in 1990; the past 15 years have seen job cuts and management changes, but nothing has staunched the steady fall to below 800,000. In September, editor and publisher Jeff Johnson publicly refused to make further cuts. 'Newspapers,' he said, 'can't cut their way into the future.' Three weeks later he was fired and the Chandlers, still substantial shareholders, began pushing harder for a break-up or sale of the company. Meanwhile, Welch, who lives in Boston, warns that his plan to buy the Globe is still embryonic; the New York Times Company says it is not for sale. Welch has reportedly been 'looking for something to sink his teeth into for a long time,' and his wife, Suzy, former editor of the Harvard Business Review, is 'enamoured' of the idea. There is a strong argument to suggest that the kind of overhaul the US newspaper business now needs is better suited to private ownership. While worrying about relentless shareholder, financial, and advertiser pressures, media organisations have shown themselves to be vulnerable to strong-arming from government to follow the official line. Under private ownership, the theory goes, they could be less easily intimidated. Wayne Stewart, managing editor of the privately-owned Topeka Capital-Journal in Kansas, told the New York Times last week that he considered public ownership 'scary as hell'. 'I prefer to know the people who run the organisation and are calling the shots,' he added. With the US newspaper business looking at its worst numbers in a decade, many editors probably share that sentiment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
