Present chief conductor and star asset is Finnish Pietari Inkinen \u2013 recently announced as conducting Bayreuth\u2019s 2020 Ring Cycle \u2013 whose ambition for his players and his own affinity for large-scale repertoire is reflected in the programming of Mahler\u2019s massive Third Symphony at most of the venues on their current British tour. Mahler\u2019s Bohemian heritage is core to the work and the orchestra\u2019s characteristically Czech sound \u2013 in particular the idiomatic wind solos \u2013 certainly brought an authenticity that underlined the logic of the choice. Inkinen\u2019s style is calm, the partnership with the 100-strong ensemble highly disciplined, his understated approach allowing the extremes of simplicity and manic force to emerge in a steady narrative thread. In the scherzo, the usually far-distant sound of the post horn was delivered with unexpected resonance by Marek Zvol\u00e1nek from high at the back of the hall. Ester Pavl\u016f was soloist in the mysterious slow movement but, in the contrast Mahler then creates between the full mezzo-soprano tone and the bell-like, angelic serenity of women\u2019s and children\u2019s voices \u2013 the Bach Choirs of Swansea and Cardiff with the Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral choir \u2013 the magic was lacking. Collaborations with more experienced forces in other performances will surely have greater conviction. Inkinen\u2019s command of the symphony\u2019s overall architectural span was implicit in the slow finale, the music\u2019s extraordinarily expressive intensity now unfolding with the same careful control as had the opening, climactic without ever having been bombastic. \u2022At Cadogan Hall, London, on 12 November and Sage, Gateshead, on 14 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
