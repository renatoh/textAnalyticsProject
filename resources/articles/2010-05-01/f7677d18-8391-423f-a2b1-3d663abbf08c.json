Less than two years later the former England coach ranks among European football's most coveted properties. After choreographing Twente to the Eredivisie title for the first time in their modern history, McClaren is courted by leading German, Portuguese and Turkish teams, his seemingly ruined career back on an upward trajectory. Unlike the majority of British managers, who often give the impression the rest of the world was created primarily for sunbathing or shopping breaks, McClaren always harboured a more global vision. He regularly told reporters covering his old Middlesbrough side that coaching abroad represented a long-standing dream. None of us truly believed him, but when it went wrong with England the Yorkshireman not only debunked such cynicism but disarmed snide whispers claiming he lacked the humility to start again from scratch. Embracing managerial minimalism he arrived in Enschede unaccompanied by English assistants and was forced to trust an all-Dutch backroom staff. Remembering he had once been Manchester United's first-team coach, McClaren burnished rough diamonds on the practice pitches before treating the Eredivisie to a superior version of 4-3-3. Last Sunday Twente were crowned champions and as supporters chanted McClaren's name and women jostled to be photographed alongside him, residents of Enschede sparked a prolonged party on a scale you might expect were Aston Villa or Everton to win the Premier League. In reality the best Martin O'Neill and David Moyes can hope for is to finish fourth one season, thereby gaining back-door Champions League entrance. Granted Villa and Goodison Park are more lucrative postings than Twente but, after witnessing Sunday's extraordinary celebration of McClarenism, one doubts they can offer remotely comparable job satisfaction. The sadness is that while around 30, largely little-known, British managers are currently working abroad, mainly beyond Europe, it remains rare for Premier League \"names\" to take similar leaps of faith and move outside their insular comfort zones. Moyes and O'Neill boast sterling qualities but both have repeatedly seen strategic shortcomings exposed by European opponents and would surely benefit from stints coaching a Besiktas or a Benfica, a Real Zaragoza or a Roma. It is all very well home-grown managers moaning when heavyweight clubs import multilingual coaching nous but how many would be prepared to follow in the footprints of Europa League finalists Fulham's much-travelled Roy Hodgson and hone hitherto underdeveloped skills in sometimes testing, technically demanding, overseas habitats? In the decades since Hodgson first swapped Croydon for foreign climes his domestic peers have developed a taste for double espressos and fine wines along with a tendency to holiday in Barbados rather than Puerto Ban\u00fas. Yet behind such deceptively worldly facades, British managers invariably cling to home comforts, consequently missing out on the delicately nuanced tactical lessons their Fulham counterpart absorbed during an exhaustive European tour. Too many cite smaller salaries, communication difficulties and the educational requirements of growing families as insurmountable barriers to expat life but, frequently, these excuses ring suspiciously hollow. Children are incredibly adaptable, money is not necessarily God and interpreters can be acquired while a new language is learnt \u2013 at Barcelona the late Sir Bobby Robson attracted a most helpful translator named Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. It would be wonderful to see members of a potentially extremely bright wave of young-ish British managers \u2013 Mark Hughes and Gareth Southgate spring immediately to mind \u2013 take a step into the unknown and, proving they are not precious or parochial after all, \"do a McClaren\". Sometimes life really is a case of Who Dares Wins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
