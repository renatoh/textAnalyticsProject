Now the trucker\u2019s birthday and Christmas plans have been thrown into disarray by the largest trucking firm bankruptcy in history. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen or if I\u2019ll get to be home if I\u2019m able to find another job quickly. I\u2019m crushed,\u201d said Smith, a truck operator for Celadon, hours after it declared it was going out of business. Smith is one of about 4,000 truck drivers across the US who were notified on Monday that their employer was ceasing operations after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The filing makes it the largest bankruptcy in trucking history. The logistics carrier, based in Indianapolis, reported annual revenues more than $1bn as recently as 2015. But a federal fraud investigation, huge debts and the \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the industry, according to the chief executive, Paul Svindland, have forced the trucking company off the road. Many of the truck drivers were left stranded in the midst of making deliveries, as they await receiving bus tickets from the company to return home, now jobless and left without benefits two weeks before Christmas. Their fuel cards were shut off, and many were reported left without any directions on where or how to turn in their rigs. \u201cWe were lied to for months,\u201d said Smith, who has worked for Celadon for a year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignored, some stranded for days. I\u2019ve still yet to hear from anyone at Celadon besides the message after midnight last night that was fleet-wide.\u201d Smith received the news about 50 miles away from her home in Centreville, Alabama. She explained the company asked her to drive her truck and leave it in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where she would receive a bus ticket back home, but she plans on leaving her truck at the Celadon terminal in Gadsden, Alabama. Celadon has its own issues. The bankruptcy comes just days after Celadon\u2019s former chief financial officer Bobby Lee Peavler and former chief operating officer Eric Meek were arrested and indicted on nine federal charges each involving a $60m fraud scheme, including conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud and conspiracy to make false statements to the company\u2019s accountants and falsify records. The company also has debts of $293m. But Celadon\u2019s collapse also comes at a difficult moment for the industry. Thousands of truckers have lost their job in 2019 as the freight market stalled and \u201cspot\u201d prices for shipping \u2013 those bought on the open market rather than as part of a contract \u2013 fell. A slowdown in a variety of markets, including housing and autos, and the impact of the US\u2019s trade wars have also contributed to the drop. About 795 companies shutdown in the first three quarters of 2019, according to transportation industry data firm Broughton Capital, three times the total number of trucker failures for the same period in 2018. The impact on workers is severe. Scott Riley of Anderson, Indiana, just started working for Celadon in August, and his health insurance coverage began 1 November. His $200-a-week health insurance plan left him with a $23 copay for the $1,400-a-month medication he needs to treat his diabetes. His wife\u2019s $450-a-month medication was completely covered. Now, Riley and his wife, Jennifer, are left with no health insurance coverage, and unsure how they are going to afford their medication. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have enough medication to make it through for 90 days,\u201d said Riley. \u201cRumor has it we will get our final paycheck Friday. They owe me over $1,000, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get it or not. Honestly it\u2019s just going to be cross your fingers and hope.\u201d Riley returned his truck to Celadon\u2019s Indianapolis terminal on the morning of 9 December, where he said dozens of other drivers were left stranded, waiting to receive bus tickets to return home. \u201cWe had no clue what was going on. Celadon themselves didn\u2019t even alert drivers. We had to find out from different driving companies what was going on,\u201d said Stephanie Floyd of Denton, North Carolina, whose husband, Travis, drove for Celadon. \u201cIt\u2019s a stressful time of year to be out of work and with three small children it makes it harder.\u201d They have been frustrated and left in the dark, as she said Celadon wasn\u2019t responding to inquiries from workers. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, trying to find another job on the drop of a dime, hoping to find something in time so we don\u2019t miss a paycheck for bills and still be able to afford to buy our children stuff for Christmas.\u201d Celadon referred comment to a press release. \u201cOur intent is to ensure drivers deliver their last loads safely and will then be instructed on where to deliver their equipment. I have no further comments,\u201d said Svindland, the chief executive, in an email."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
