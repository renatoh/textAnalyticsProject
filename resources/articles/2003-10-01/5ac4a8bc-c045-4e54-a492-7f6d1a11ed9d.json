He makes much more appeal as a bet at around 20-1 than either High Chaparral or Dalakhani at about a tenth of those odds. Vinnie Roe has only been beaten twice, both times on fast ground, on his last 11 starts, in the Ascot Gold Cup and the Melbourne Cup. He is used to travelling on the bridle in staying events and I can see him running on strongly to reach the frame. High Chaparral makes more sense to me than Dalakhani, who has been beaten the only time he got into a fight in the Irish Derby, while there cannot be value in Doyen's price of about 5-1. The German Derby winner Dai Jin beat a good yardstick in Next Desert last time and should be another arriving late on the scene with the admirable Mubtaker expected to find this first test against Group One rivals just beyond him. The Prix de l'Abbaye is Airwave's chance to make up for a disappointing season. She is well drawn and Dane O'Neill will ride her more positively than at Ascot last time. The Newsman has won on five successive visits to Fontwell and another win is on the cards in the 4.00, while Phar From Frosty can account for poor opposition in the long-distance novices' hurdle (2.40) at Market Rasen. His trainer, Charlie Egerton, has had nine winners from 32 runners at the Lincolnshire course over six seasons.
