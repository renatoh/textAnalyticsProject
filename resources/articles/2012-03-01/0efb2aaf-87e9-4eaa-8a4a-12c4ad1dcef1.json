Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief executive, said: \"What we will certainly be doing is looking at every aspect of what happened and if there are ways and means of making it better in the future \u2013 just like we did following the Petr Cech incident. We will do everything we can to make sure we reduce to the point of elimination, things like that.\" After Cech suffered a fractured skull at Reading, the manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, hit out at the delay in the goalkeeper being taken to hospital. The club made an official complaint that initiated a Premier League and Football Association review, and measures were introduced that included an ambulance being in place for the players exclusive use and club doctors attending every game. Scudamore stated the Cech incident had been \"a wake-up call\" for the Premier League. \"In some ways, [Muamba's] life, if it is saved \u2013 and let's hope it has been saved \u2013 is as a result of the things a lot of us put in place after what happened with Petr Cech,\" said Scudamore. Mancini, who has been City manager since December 2009, said: \"Here in England is the best championship in the world, fantastic, but we need to improve the medical side. We need to screen the players more often, maybe two times a year and more accurately.\" City do heart scans each summer but Mancini is not content with this. \"When I saw our medical [system], I was really worried two years ago. It's impossible that one young guy dies on the pitch because we didn't do a medical [frequently]. I want our players and all players in the league to have a more accurate medical. Always, not just once a year. It is really good and better in Italy. They happen every six months. \"I spoke with the doctor last summer and he said that this is how it is done in England. I am not satisfied with this because the medicals are really light. I hope the club will speak with the FA and it is the same for the other clubs.\" Of Muamba, who is now responding to conversation, Mancini said: \"I hope that it will go very well for him and I pray for him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
