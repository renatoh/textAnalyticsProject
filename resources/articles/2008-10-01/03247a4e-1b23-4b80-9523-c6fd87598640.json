Authorities said the International Anti-Corruption Academy would open next autumn in Laxenburg, Vienna. As a result of the recent economic crisis \"resources will become more scarce\" and foreign aid would dwindle, said Interpol secretary-general Ronald Noble, who came up with the idea. He said many courses will last only a week to three weeks, with senior officials taught to pass on their training. Associated Press in Vienna Bruni-Sarkozy visits sick ex-Red Brigade member Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has become personally involved in the case of a former Red Brigades member, visiting the woman in hospital, France's president said yesterday. Bruni-Sarkozy visited Marina Petrella, 54, last week to tell her she would not be sent to Italy to serve her life sentence for complicity in the 1991 murder of an Italian police chief, the daily Lib\u00e9ration reported. Petrella has been in France since the 1990s, and was jailed last year. But a French court ordered in August that she be freed after she was diagnosed with severe depression. Nicolas Sarkozy has told Italy he will not extradite her. Associated Press in Paris"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
