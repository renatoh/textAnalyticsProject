The German seems keen to forget, or at least dismiss, the fact that he took over from Craig Brown in March and promptly led the team to successive defeats against France, Nigeria, South Korea, South Africa and the Danes. The record, according to him, should really only read that he has lost to Denmark, drawn with the Faroe Islands and beaten Iceland and Canada. \"We have to forget the 5-0 defeat against France,\" he explained. \"That is in the past. I didn't know the players or their positions then. Really my first game was against Denmark.\" It is an interesting concept and it is clear Vogts prefers to accentuate the positive rather than dwell on the negative, and he hopes that will still be the case after tonight's friendly against Portugal in Braga. The Portuguese, Rui Costa, Figo et al, will be the biggest test for the new-look Scots in terms of individual brilliance since France. Vogts said: \"I first of all want a good result, then a good performance, and finally entertainment for everyone. It will be a big test.\" Vogts will avoid man-marking the likes of Figo and instead insist his side sticks with its own game plan which will involve Christian Dailly playing in midfield as he did in the last match against Canada. The West Ham defender has been earmarked for a specific role with the Euro 2004 qualifier against Germany next June in mind and Vogts declared: \"I want him for a position that is very important for the balance of the side.\" Vogts has shown his players video evidence of their previous appearances. \"I show them the good things first, but then tell them to wait for the next bit. It is good, though, that they can see for themselves what they do right and wrong,\" he added. Dailly revealed: \"We borrowed Manchester United's equipment when West Ham won 1-0 at Old Trafford last season and the video system they have can pinpoint different things. We saw, for instance, how we stuck to a rigid 4-4-2 formation while they were all over the place and it is good to be able to analyse that kind of thing.\" Portugal (3-5-2, probable): Quim; Couto, Ricardo Silva, Rocha; Meira, Rui Costa, Tiago, Figo, Neca; Pauleta, Nuno Gomes. Scotland (3-5-2): Douglas (Celtic); Anderson (Aberdeen), Pressley (Hearts), Wilkie (Dundee); Alexander (Preston), Dailly (West Ham), Lambert (Celtic), Ross (Rangers), Naysmith (Everton); Crawford (Dunfermline), Dobie (West Brom)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
