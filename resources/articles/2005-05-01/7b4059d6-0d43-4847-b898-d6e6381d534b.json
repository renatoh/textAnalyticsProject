In summer, it's all sparkling seas and silver sands, but many of the South Hams' lovely inland villages lie along its rivers - the Dart, Erme, Yealm and Avon. To the west of the area around the Yealm estuary are some of the prettiest villages imaginable. Noss Mayo and Newton Ferrers are havens for yachties and admirers of picture-postcard scenery. Further around the coast are the wonderful beaches of Bigbury and Bantham, on either side of the Avon estuary; both favoured spots for surfers. Heading east, you reach Salcombe, one of the most southerly towns in England. In the summer, it's heaving with second-homeowners, expensive yachts and the odd celebrity, earning it the sobriquet \"England's St Tropez\" - much to the chagrin of the locals, who complain that the prices of property and eating out have spiralled in recent years. Heading up the coast towards Dartmouth you will pass Slapton Sands, a dramatic three-mile stretch of shingle beach where allied troops practised manoeuvres for the D-Day landings. Further along the coast road, as Start Bay opens up ahead, the scenery is so awesome that traffic slows as drivers take in the view. Just beyond the village of Stoke Fleming, where there are cliff walks, is the golden shingle beach - with a pine forest backdrop - known as Blackpool Sands; it's clean, dog-free year round and has good facilities including the Venus Cafe, which dispenses everything from ice-creams and beers to organic sandwiches and salads. The South Hams' western coastline ends around Dartmouth. The steep drive into the town reveals the estuary and the Balamory-esque village of Kingswear across the water with its pastel-painted cottages tightly packed on the hillside. On a headland to the east is the National Trust-owned Coleton Fishacre (01803 752466), an Arts and Crafts-style house with an art deco interior, built in the 1920s for Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of impresario Richard. The grounds are a gardener's delight, incorporating woodland and sub-tropical species and paths leading out to the cliff edge. About 12 miles from Dartmouth is Totnes, an ancient market town which has become a bit of a New Age centre. Herbalists, healers and alternative therapists have set up shop here. It also has some great eateries and food stores, including the fabulous Ticklemore Cheese Shop (1 Ticklemore Street, 01803 865926). If you are planning a picnic, make a beeline for award-winning Effings (50 Fore Street, 01803 863435), a foodie's paradise stocked with cheeses, charcuterie, breads and takeaway dishes prepared by the on-site chef. Where to stay Browns Hotel &amp; Bar, Dartmouth Formerly the Little Admiral Hotel, this has been revamped to become a stylish, modern addition to Dartmouth's hotels. The rooms are decorated in earthy tones, many with attractive wooden beds. The bar contains large comfortable sofas where you can enjoy tapas and a glass of wine. How much? \u00a380-\u00a3155 double (01803 832572). Fingals Hotel Coombe, Dittisham An extremely relaxed, fabulously quirky place to stay, this carefully restored and extended 17th-century farmhouse is like a mini resort, equipped with heated conservatory pool, sauna, Jacuzzi and masseuse, plus croquet and lawn tennis courts. Rooms are predominantly of the English country mould given a stylish twist with original modern artworks. Families may want to opt for the self-catering barn, while the two-floor \"folly\", a tiny old mill house with a four-poster bed and an upstairs balcony overlooking the stream, offers privacy for couples. How much? \u00a375-\u00a3160 double. Two-course set dinner \u00a327.50 (01803 722398). Burgh Island Hotel, Bigbury-on-Sea Reached by sea tractor, over the sand on foot or by hotel-run taxi, depending on the state of the tide, this island is a one-off. The splendid hotel started life as a high-society hideaway in the late 1920s and 30s, for the likes of Noel Coward and Agatha Christie Restored to its art deco glory, with many original pieces of furniture and classic bathrooms, it's a glamorous and discreet place, not quite of this century. Televisions are out, cocktails are most definitely in. Dances are held in the ballroom and guests are encouraged to dress up. The food is sourced from local farms. The island's ancient pub, the Pilchard Inn, serves great beer and food cooked in the hotel kitchen (mains \u00a35-\u00a38.50, puddings \u00a34.75). How much? \u00a3275-\u00a3420 double inc dinner (01548 810514). Eat and drink Alf Resco, Dartmouth Alf Resco has punters queuing up for bacon sandwiches or a full English. The interior has the intimacy of a bustling ship's cabin. In summer, they have weekend \"rustic suppers\", featuring anything from authentic Mexican to an evening of sea shanties and locally caught seafood. Contact: 01803 835880. Main courses \u00a35-\u00a310. Set dinner (Fri-Sun) \u00a321.50. No credit cards. New Angel, Dartmouth TV chef John Burton Race undertook a timely revamp of the Carved Angel overlooking the Dart estuary. Now resurrected as the New Angel, there's a vigour and energy about the place that's long been absent. Gone are the stuffiness, pretensions and wilful old-fashionedness, replaced by a thoroughly urban bustle; accessible, uncomplicated food (sea bass with oyster broth) and an attention to detail. Contact: 01803 839425). Main courses \u00a314-\u00a325. Oyster Shack, Bigbury The Oyster Shack goes a long way to providing what people actually want from a restaurant, as opposed to what restaurateurs think their customers want. You must book here, regardless of the day. Not bad for a bring-your-own place that's little more than a shack with a tarpaulin out front. Of course, the setting's part of the fun, but the main draw is the ultra-fresh seafood: own-farmed mussels and oysters, pan-fried sardines, potted shrimp, shell-on prawns or whatever the catch of the day might be. Contact: Milburn Orchard Farm, Stakes Hill, Bigbury (01548 810876). Main courses \u00a36.95-\u00a316.95. Willow, Totnes Given the proliferation of alternative types in the area, it's surprising how few vegetarian restaurants there are in Totnes. Willow makes up for it in spades and is particularly active in highlighting concerns over GM crops. Yet the cheerful decor (with a pretty courtyard at the back), helpful staff and a back room with a pile of toys for kids are anything but po-faced. Curry nights on Wednesday and music sessions on Friday are always busy, so it's worth booking. Contact: 01803 862605. Main courses \u00a36.50-\u00a37.95. No credit cards. Winking Prawn, Salcombe This uncontrived, beach hut-style restaurant is reminiscent of the sort of seafront cafe you might find in Australia. It manages to be both functional and hip, with whitewashed floorboards and furniture, large windows dressed with canvas blinds, and a front garden with tables overlooking the beach. Unsurprisingly, prawns - and seafood in general - feature fairly heavily on the menu. During the day, you can have anything from a sandwich or ice-cream to a plate of fruits de mer, and more sophisticated dishes such as whole cracked crab with a\u00efoli in the evening. Booking is recommended. Contact: 01548 842326). Main courses \u00a39.75-\u00a314.95. \u00b7 Extracted from Time Out Weekend Breaks in Great Britain and Ireland, published on June 2 at \u00a314.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
