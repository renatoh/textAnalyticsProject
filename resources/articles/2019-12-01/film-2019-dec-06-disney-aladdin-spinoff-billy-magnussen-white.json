The project was revealed to the Hollywood Reporter on Friday afternoon, and will see the actor Billy Magnussen reprise his role as the affable, goofy Prince Anders. Jordan Dunn and Michael Kvamme will act as screenwriters. The film is to premiere on Disney\u2019s new streaming service, Disney+. \u201cSo... uh... just after the news the actor who played Aladdin can\u2019t get work, Disney announces a spin-off about the token white guy in one scene!\u201d one fan wrote on Twitter. Many fans are confused by the decision. Prince Anders, an original character created for the live-action version, only appeared in a few scenes. Some wonder why, in a film replete with characters of color, the studio is focusing on a white one. Mena Massoud, who played Aladdin in this year\u2019s live-action remake, made news this week after he opened up about struggling to land auditions, even after starring in a film that grossed over $1bn. \u201cI\u2019m kind of tired of staying quiet about it,\u201d Massoud told the Daily Beast. \u201cI want people to know that it\u2019s not always dandelions and roses when you\u2019re doing something like Aladdin. \u2018He must have made millions. He must be getting all these offers.\u2019 It\u2019s none of those things. I haven\u2019t had a single audition since Aladdin came out.\u201d The admission sparked conversations about the struggles actors of color face in Hollywood. When asked about Massoud\u2019s admission during a press interview, Will Smith, who played Genie in Aladdin, responded: \u201cThe thing about this business, that is not unlike life: it\u2019s hard by design. It\u2019s like the universe, God, whatever you believe designed it to be hard, right? So, if you\u2019re having a hard time, it\u2019s because you\u2019re supposed to.\u201d Disney was not immediately available for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
