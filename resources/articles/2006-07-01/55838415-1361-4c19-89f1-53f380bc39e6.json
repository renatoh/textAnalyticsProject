Ellis is a lame duck", "bodyText": "There's no question that the next Aston Villa manager has got to be Martin O'Neill and not Sven-Goran Eriksson. There's something about Martin that players respect. He gets the most out of them, which he proved at Leicester and Celtic, and he's got an excellent track record. I know you can say the same about Sven at club level but I'm not convinced he would be well received by the fans after his time with England. Villa supporters will only feel secure by having Martin O'Neill in charge. It might well need a takeover for that to happen. It certainly doesn't matter whether the money behind the new owner is pounds or dollars because the club need fresh blood. It looks as though the American billionaire Randy Lerner wasn't too keen after speaking to Doug Ellis, which is no surprise. The Villa chairman doesn't want to relinquish control. His big worry is that once he's gone he's going to be forgotten very quickly because someone else will come in, be successful and expose how poor a job he has done. It's a very selfish attitude and boils down to the fact that Villa have not won anything other than a couple of League Cups in his second spell at the club. Ellis keeps hanging on, hoping that the day will come when the club win a big prize so he can say he was involved. He wants to say that he was there and \"This is what I gave the fans\". The reality is that the record books show Villa haven't been successful during his reign and they're miles off the pace now. People say that Doug's invested quite a lot of money in the club but how much of it was Doug's money? Look at the money that has come from television, and through the turnstiles, to sign players over the years. You only have to look over at Birmingham City, where you see the owners prepared to stick their hands in their pockets and invest in the team. If anyone else had come in and taken over the club when Doug returned as chairman in late 1982 they would have continued to be successful, building on what we had achieved in winning the league title in 1981 and then the European Cup in 1982. Doug wanted to try and mould a side not in the manager's name but in his so he could take the plaudits, but it's not happened. He's got away with it, though, because there has never been anyone on the board who has really challenged him. At last there is excitement for the fans now because they can actually see a chink of light at the end of the tunnel. The problem is that every time the light flickers it quickly disappears because of Ellis's desire to remain in charge. It's happened on each occasion that someone has put a bid in. If the takeover talks fall through again this time the club will look like a laughing stock to the world of football. Ellis won't care, though, because if he did he would have sold his shares by now. He needs to do that as soon as possible because with the season not far off it's vital the uncertainty surrounding the club gets sorted once and for all. There will be players who could be contemplating leaving, and there is no manager to look after that side of things. If the right man comes in, those players who are thinking about getting away might be prepared to stay. But there's nothing to make the players want to stay at the moment - no new faces, no manager, and a lot of unrest. If I was at Villa now, I'd want to leave. The players could feel very different if new life is breathed into the club. Ellis has been able to survive four or five possible takeovers but, hopefully, if the fans can really stick together as a group and don't get swayed by the chairman as to who he might bring in as manager, then he will realise he's not wanted and go. Villa supporters have to decide what they want for the next 10 years. A lame duck is what they have got at the moment. Dennis Mortimer was captain of Aston Villa when they won the First Division in 1981 and European Cup in 1982. He made 403 appearances for the club between 1975 and 1985"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
