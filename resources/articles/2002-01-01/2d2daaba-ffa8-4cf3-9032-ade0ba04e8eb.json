But, when he described England's campaigns in the last two World Cups as \"shambolic\", he was dead right. The England captain was speaking just prior to his squad's return yesterday to India for a six-match one-day series. Three summers ago in Britain, under Alec Stewart's captaincy, England did not get beyond the group stages, ignominiously eliminated before the competition's theme music had been released. Three and a half years previously on the subcontinent, with Mike Atherton as captain and Raymond Illingworth seemingly in charge of everything else, they arrived with little idea of a strategy or a side to implement it and discovered to their horror that the rest of the world had moved on. In an embarrassingly one- sided quarter-final they were hoofed out by the eventual winners Sri Lanka. Ignoring triumphs over United Arab Emirates, Holland and Kenya, the only sides of consequence they have beaten in 12 World Cup matches since their successful semi-final against South Africa in Sydney in 1992 have been Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Shambolic is putting it kindly. Hussain is determined that the same mistake will not be made under his stewardship. The World Cup does not begin until early next year in southern Africa but the 16-man party chosen for the current tour of India and the five games in New Zealand that follow will form the nucleus of the final cup squad. \"We do not have enough time or games to start messing around with teams now,\" Hussain said yesterday. \"The best sides in past World Cups have had two things: consistent selection policies from early on, and a plan. \"We have to start working to give people enough time to get ready for the World Cup and start developing our plans. Some names are bound to be added and some taken away. But this squad is the basis of it all and we need to start now, not in six months but from the moment we get on the plane.\" Ever since Hussain took over the captaincy from Stewart he has been adamant that to succeed at one-day cricket it was imperative that England took on an increasing workload to gain the sort of experience found in the opposition. Stewart, for instance, is the most capped Englishman with 148 but 59 cricketers exceed that and they will soon be joined by Glenn McGrath and Shaun Pollock. Put another way, when England face India in a couple of weeks Sachin Tendulkar (280) and Anil Kumble (215) will have more caps between them than the entire 16-man England party. Experience is not everything but it goes a long way. So the next 12 months will be the most hectic ever in this regard, with India and New Zealand followed by the triangular series against India and Sri Lanka at home next summer, the ICC Trophy in India and Sri Lanka at the end of September and the triangular series in Australia next winter. In all it will provide a minimum of 27 matches and a maximum of 37. Even that is still scratching the surface in terms of the coming World Cup. Only when it is projected ahead to the West Indies four years later, and the possibility that by then Jamie Foster, for example, at 27, will have scooted by Stewart's record, does the workload carry a real dividend. Part of the experience will be gathered under floodlights. Leaving aside England's strategic failures, their shortcomings in day-night matches have been exposed consistently. At home, in particular, such games are a lottery dependent to a ridiculous degree on the toss of a coin but their record under lights abroad is woeful - seven wins in 25 matches since Adam Hollioake's successful foray into Sharjah four years ago. \"We need more experience, without question,\" Hussain admitted, \"and the more we play under them the better we will get. One reason we lose so often is that the opposition know the conditions more intimately. If we got to a World Cup quarter- or semi-final and failed, we cannot use lack of experience under lights as an excuse. 'Train the brain' is a phrase often used by Duncan Fletcher [England coach] and we have to get used to them.\" Central to the strategy will be the use of the white ball and Matthew Hoggard's ability to swing it. On the recent trip to Zimbabwe the Yorkshire pace bowler took 10 wickets at 13.9 apiece, exceptional bowling, and he is already pencilled into the team for this trip, leaving the returning Darren Gough and Andy Caddick to scrap over a remaining place. \u00b7Leicestershire have signed the Australian Michael Bevan, previously with Yorkshire and Sussex, as their overseas player for this summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
