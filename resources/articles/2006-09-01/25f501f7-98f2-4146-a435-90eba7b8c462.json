But since I moved to Ibiza I've found it's alive and well, albeit in a rather different guise. In a strange way the discos here have replaced the end-of-the-pier shows that used to entertain the Brits during their annual holidays. Just as the seaside variety theatres were dark for most of the year, so it is with the clubs in the \"clubbing capital of the world\". This Sunday one of the biggest, Space, holds its closing party and that marks the end of the season until June 2007. Theoretically the clubs have three months a year to make a return on their outlay on highly sophisticated decor, lighting and sound systems. In practice the timescale is much shorter than that; a couple of weeks either side of August is the only time they get close to capacity. Although only a proportion of the 1.8 million visitors to Ibiza are clubbers, they reflect the island's most obvious unique selling proposition. I've become fascinated by the economics of it all, if only because the sums are so huge and so shrouded in mystery. I even had one meeting with a promoter cancelled at the last minute because anybody connected with the club is barred from speaking to the British media. Officially the seven largest clubs on Ibiza had a combined income of a little over \u20ac25m, about \u00a317m, in 2003, the most recent year for which figures are available. But that's only part of the story. During the summer here you don't go out to a disco - you go to a \"night\" or a \"party\", because each day the clubs are taken over by a separate promoter. The scale of the competition can be imagined from the maths. Seven clubs and seven nights means 49 promoters are vying for custom. Privilege, proudly the world's largest nightclub, has a capacity of over 10,000. Each of the others can hold several thousand people. Admission prices vary, but for a night in August it's usually around \u20ac45-60 (\u00a330-\u00a340). Drinks in the ultra-fashionable Pacha range from \u20ac8 (\u00a35.50) for a small, still water to \u20ac15 (\u00a310) for a mixed drink. In the VIP area a bottle of vodka with mixers is \u20ac250 (over \u00a3170). Prices in the other clubs are not much less. Of course, not every club is full to capacity each night, far from it. That's where the promoters come in. Since disco fever petered out at the end of the 1980s, a predominantly British crew has competed to fill the venues. It's a delicate balancing act they have to follow because nobody wants to go on to an empty dancefloor, but accusations of \"selling out\" can be almost as damaging. After a number of successful years, for instance, Britain's best-known clubbing brand, Ministry of Sound, has virtually disappeared from the island. The trick is to get the right word-of-mouth buzz, which is why it's always easier to get in free on the guest list at the start of the season. You'll tell your friends not just about the music and superstar DJs, but the transvestite stilt walkers, scantily-clad male and female dancers, even the live sex show that used to be part of Manumission's Privilege party. For Manumission differentiation has come in the form of live music, rather than DJs, under the banner Ibiza Rocks. It gives you some idea of how much the clubbing business is worth to the island when Manumission promoter Andy McKay says: \"We lost \u00a3100,000 last year. This year we've budgeted to lose \u00a360,000, but we might just break even.\" That was achieved thanks to sponsorship from mobile phone company Sony Ericsson and a TV deal with Channel 4. Sponsorship money is flowing into other clubs along with cash from merchandise and souvenir CDs. So how much is it all worth? Nobody knows. Despite the sums involved, the whole clubbing business seems to be run with less concern for accountancy practices than you'd find at the average village barn dance. I'm sure they must have had a better idea when they ran end-of-the-pier shows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
