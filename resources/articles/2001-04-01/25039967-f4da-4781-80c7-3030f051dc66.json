If the Cambridge psychedelicists were ahead of the curve in the late 1970s, suddenly they sound like a lost legend from a mythical era. Back at the helm is Robyn Hitchcock, somewhat greyer of hair but no less oblique in mind. He explained that the quartet had just returned from the US, and were grotesquely jet-lagged. \"We don't look like this and we don't sound like this,\" he warned. But if you can live with Hitchcock's Lewis Carroll imagery and magic-mushroom logic, you can quickly appreciate that the Soft Boys offer as fine a brew of psychedelic pop and classic English whimsy as anybody has mustered since Syd Barrett went AWOL. Refreshed by their 20-year lay-off, the Boys ripped through their set with energy and dazzling expertise. They limbered up with Sideways, a tricky instrumental in 7/4 time, then started piling on the harmonies and the meshing guitar parts through the likes of Sudden Town and the ingenious, devious Kingdom of Love. With Matthew Seligman and Morris Windsor supplying simpatico support on bass and drums, the decks were cleared for the interlocking guitars of Hitchcock and Kimberley Rew. The pair never merely fill space with vacuous axeman bluster because the guitar parts are integral to the structure of the songs. Rew's muscular playing dovetails eloquently with Hitchcock's glassier, more quavering tone - nowhere more impressively than on Insanely Jealous. The combination of instrumental guile and three-part harmonies gives the Boys options that the bog-standard guitar combo can never dream of. They handled the off-centre harmonies and ringing chords of I Wanna Destroy You with aplomb (it was dedicated to George W Bush), and comfortably embraced songs as different as the anthemic Mr Kennedy or the riffed-up Only the Stones Remain without breaking their stride. There was even a bonus Spinal Tap moment with Rock'n'Roll Toilet, which had Rew grinning idiotically from beneath his pudding-basin Brian Jones haircut. As reunions go, this one goes miles further. \u0095 Soft Boys play the Waterfront, Norwich (01603 508050), on April 22, Rock City, Nottingham (0115-941 2544), on April 23, The Garage, Glasgow (0141-248 1661) on April 24, then tour."}, "isHosted": false}}}
