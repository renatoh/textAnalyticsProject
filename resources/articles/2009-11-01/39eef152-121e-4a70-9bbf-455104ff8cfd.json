Mickey is really concerned they won't take 20 wickets,\" Donald said today. \"It is the back-up bowlers he is worried about, there is too much of the same [type of bowling] and that is a concern. \"I think the South Africa attack is a bit weaker than England's. The England attack is a nose in front with tall bowlers, guys who can make the ball talk, guys who bowl heavy lengths.\" Given the fitness issues surrounding the England team Donald's opinion will be welcomed. He was talking, primarily about the four-match Test series which will start in a month's time, and as someone who worked as England's bowling coach last year his view is a measured one. \"Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Jacques Kallis and the spinner, probably Paul Harris, that is the combination I would like to see. \"But there is a reluctance to play Morne because he is a bit erratic. He is still learning his game. He came straight into the Test arena. What the selectors don't understand is that, like Brett Lee, he came from nowhere but he can take wickets and his inconsistency makes him a threat. \"Makhaya is on the slide. He is on the brink of his 100th Test and he is consistently bowling at 132k [about 80mph] so that is a concern too.\" According to Donald, who took 330 Test wickets for South Africa, both Arthur and the captain, Graeme Smith, are worried about England, who are in fifth place in the Test rankings. \"I think England have a real chance in the Test series. As a South African I'm concerned about the England Test team. I quietly watched them practice in Bloemfontein and I think they feel they can do this. The English Test team is a worry for me. \"There are concerns in the South African team. You can see that Smith is worried and that Arthur is concerned about his bowling attack. They are not where they should be confidence-wise and the vibes I'm picking up are that they are a concerned side. \"They went to sleep after winning in Australia, had two weeks off and got out of the blocks far too slowly in the return series. They cannot afford to do the same against England.\" Allan Donald is commentating for Sky Sports during its live and HD coverage of England's tour to South Africa"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
