The board is split over whether Paul Myners - who is also chairman of GMG, publisher of the Guardian - should stay on as the head of the ailing retailer. Mr Myners has made it clear he wants to remain in a job he took on an interim basis last year and has the support of M&amp;S's chief executive, Stuart Rose. Mr Myners insists he will not step down. Senior non-executive Kevin Lomax, however, wants Mr Myners replaced. He has drawn up a list of three potential successors and has the support of the retailer's three other non-executives. The split was on the agenda at yesterday's scheduled board meeting, but no agreement was reached. The pro- and anti-Myners factions are understood to have become entrenched. In the City there is speculation that the row will end with both Mr Myners and Mr Lomax departing from the board. But Mr Rose's relationship with the other non-executives is also now said to be strained. He is keen to find a solution before the posting of M&amp;S's full-year results on Tuesday week. An M&amp;S spokesman refused to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
