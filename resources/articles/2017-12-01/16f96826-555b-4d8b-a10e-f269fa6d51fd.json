Now a historian has claimed the character, who comes back as a ghost to visit Scrooge and teach him the error of his ways, was actually inspired by a real man whom Dickens had met and had promised to make him a household name. In the fable, which has spawned hundreds of film and stage versions, the central character Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Marley, who is haunted by the way he lived his life. Cornish historian Barry West began researching the inspiration for the character after hearing rumours that there was a connection between Cornwall, Dickens and A Christmas Carol. He discovered a London physician Dr Miles Marley, who died in Port Isaac on 15 November 1854 and who Dickens is thought to have met in London prior to writing A Christmas Carol. West also believes that the novelist\u2019s visits to Cornwall provided further inspiration for some of the scenes in the book. West has spent years carrying out meticulous research to prove the connection between A Christmas Carol and his home county, which Dickens was known to have visited a number of times. West said: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an old forgotten story about Dickens and [Miles] Marley and Cornwall, but I wanted to find out the real facts.\u201d He found out where the real man was buried and discovered he had been a physician in London. After contacting the Dickens Society and a Dickens expert to enquire about the origins of the name Marley in the novel, he received what he believes is confirmation that the two had met. He said: \u201cI was sent a newspaper clipping from the Dickens expert, which said that on St Patrick\u2019s Day, at 11 Cork Street, Westminster, London, a Dr Miles Marley had invited guests over to celebrate \u2013 one of those guests was Charles Dickens. \u201cThe clipping said that Dickens had started a discussion over unusual names and it was agreed that Marley was indeed an unusual name. It was said that Dickens told Marley, \u2018by the end of the year your name will be a household word\u2019.\u201d That same doctor then moved to Cornwall and died shortly afterwards. West added: \u201cI have no doubt that this is the same Dr Miles Marley that Charles Dickens dined with in London and the same Marley that the writer got the name for his character Jacob Marley.\u201d Diana Archibald, secretary-treasurer for the Dickens Society, told the Guardian: \u201cDickens often used names of people he met or heard about, so it is very much possible that the Marley connection is true. She added: \u201cIt is always interesting to see these details come to light.\u201d West also believes some of the places which are vividly described in the book paint the picture of Cornwall\u2019s rough and wild landscape perfectly. When the second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, visits Scrooge, he takes him to a market where cheerful people are buying ingredients for Christmas dinner and \u201cexchanging a facetious snowball\u201d. Afterwards, Scrooge is taken to see how miners, sailors, and lighthouse keepers still have the festive spirit despite living in harsh conditions. West said: \u201cWe know that Charles Dickens came to Cornwall a few times. He went to Land\u2019s End, Rock and Tintagel, he wrote letters about it that are now in The Dickensian [journal], he wanted to go to the most remote parts of Cornwall. \u201cIf you read A Christmas Carol, some of the passages and descriptions he writes \u2013 it\u2019s undoubtedly based on the time he spent in Cornwall.\u201d He also believes that the novel goes into detail about the county\u2019s rugged coastline, raging sea and even possibly one of Cornwall\u2019s most famous lighthouses. He said: \u201cThere has been a lot of speculation on what lighthouse Dickens speaks about in the novel. \u201cMany people thought that the lighthouse could be Trevose Head, but because we know where Dickens went when he visited Cornwall, the distance out to sea the lighthouse was and the year the story was written, in my mind, there is no doubt that it was the original Longships Lighthouse.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
