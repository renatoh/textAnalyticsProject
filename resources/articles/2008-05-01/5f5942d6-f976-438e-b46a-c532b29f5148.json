They are lucky. It was the old wives' abortion remedy that dominated my youth. It gained wide currency through a scene in Alan Sillitoe's novel, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, published in 1958, and reached a new audience through Karel Reisz's equally powerful film in 1960. If you didn't know a backstreet abortionist or a discreet Harley Street practitioner, this was how you did it. You sat in a boiling bath and you swallowed the gin. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. We were ignorant, and fertile, and full of fear. Heavy petting verging on intercourse filled us with dread. How far could you go? Could you get pregnant from sperm in the bedclothes? Contraceptive advice was out of reach for the timid and the less articulate. Unwanted pregnancies forced women into impossible situations and ruined innumerable lives. Some of us dared to talk about it - there were some girls who seemed to know everything - but most of us didn't. Many law-abiding women of my generation had illegal abortions. Some of us just had more and more babies. And many of us fought for abortion law reform, which was finally introduced through David Steel's private member's bill in 1967. I didn't march - I had too many babies - but I wrote about the campaign in the press and celebrated the outcome. I mark this as the true watershed of the 1960s. This was when women began to feel they had a right to take control of their lives. It's hard to describe how helpless and frightened we used to be. Over recent years I have talked to groups of students about my novel The Millstone, published in 1966 and written when I was expecting my third child. The narrator of this novel chooses to have an illegitimate baby rather than an abortion. The students I met didn't find her choice surprising, but they were astonished to learn that abortion was in those days a criminal offence. They were shocked too by how much women used to drink and smoke during pregnancy, and seemed to think we ought to have known better. But the abortion dilemma seemed beyond their radar. They just couldn't imagine a world without condoms. No woman looks forward to having an abortion, just as no man enjoys having a tooth extracted. The best that an abortion can be is a least bad outcome. Abortion may come as a relief but it is often a tragic, and never a happy choice. Now there is pressure to lower the legal abortion limit from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. Some of those exerting this pressure are against abortion per se. They oppose all abortion, for any reason. But others are rethinking their position in the light of new medical evidence, and they must be taken more seriously. The later the abortion, the more tragic the circumstances; that should be blindingly obvious. Terminations at 24 weeks are traumatic for all concerned, and an indication that something has gone very wrong. Nobody wants a late abortion, and few surely want to perform one. (The image of the abortionist as a sadist was a cliche of fiction, but was it based on fact or fear? I am told Mike Leigh's Vera Drake performed a service by re-describing this role, but I've been too cowardly to see it.) But the nature of the operation is not in itself a reason to lower the abortion limit. The history of abortion law is littered with hard cases ignored by parliament and the judiciary: they have now, thankfully, been accommodated by a good-enough law, which should not be subverted by emotional argument. But is it now time for pro-abortionists to reconsider the scientific evidence? In 1938 one of the pioneers of reform, Dr AW Bourne, allowed himself to be charged as a test case, for terminating the pregnancy of a 14-year-old rape victim; in a landmark judgement, he was acquitted. But he grew unhappy with the speed of change, and in 1966 became a founder member of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. One of life's little ironies. We do not know much about the capacity for pain of the unborn child, but new evidence about foetal sentience is disturbing. It is not good enough to say that anti-abortionists exploit it for propaganda purposes. Mothers have always had different views on babies from the professionals, and many have instinctively resisted such remarks as \"they can't feel a thing\" and \"it's just a reflex\". Mothers know that babies respond from birth, and it seems astonishing that we need academics to inform us that they can tell friend from foe long before they can talk. The assumption that babies can't feel pain has been handy for doctors, who traditionally avoid giving them anaesthetics. I understand this may be because anaesthetics could be dangerous, but then again it may just be indifference. Babies can't talk and they cry all the time anyway, and their mothers make a fuss about nothing. Some women are wary about the concept of a foetus having rights, aware of a potential conflict of interest. Yet these same women might also, when happily rather than unhappily pregnant, play Mozart to their unborn, or (rightly) express the need to mourn a miscarriage. The possibility of advanced foetal sentience complicates the abortion argument and there is no point in pretending otherwise. Scientists at UCL claim to have established that premature babies do suffer from the insertion of a heel lance or a chest tube, and unless you believe that full sentience accompanies the instant of birth but cannot precede it, this must be a cause of anxiety. If, like the philosopher Richard Rorty, you believe cruelty is the worst thing we humans do, you do not wish to extend the scope of deliberate or inadvertent cruelty to what you are carrying in your womb. We do not want to know that the unborn baby can suffer pain, for it makes us yet more responsible, our potential for guilt yet greater. It should also make us anxious about the wisdom and ethics of keeping barely viable babies alive - in a state of constant pain? - but that's another problem, although the two are sometimes confused and conflated. A 24-week aborted foetus and a premature baby are at the same stage of gestation, but while premature babies are often born early because of medical complications, the aborted foetus may be healthy. New evidence of the low survival rate (and poor long-term prognosis) of those born before 24 weeks cuts both ways. We do not know when a baby becomes a person. The Catholic Church has one view, and Barbara Smoker, the veteran Humanist activist, has another. \"Eggs are not people,\" she declared in her 1985 pamphlet on embryo research. Each pregnant woman has her own response. Some bond at conception, and can now follow progress on scans as well as by thumps, kicks and measurements. Others wait till the moment of birth. Doris Lessing has written of her strong sense of the separate identity and personality of each of her children at birth (a view then little supported by the medical profession) and has also speculated that each unborn foetus lives through aeons of time in the womb, an eternity of nothingness as it goes through the whole cycle of evolution. The threshold of coming-into-being is dim and ill-defined. It is not a subject for crude polemic but for wonder and humility and waiting. Meanwhile, we should respect the law as it stands. It is less cruel than the 20-week alternative on offer. And it is a great deal better than a bottle of gin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
