Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen series two episode three. Read Vicky Frost\u2019s recap of episode two here The Latimer trial Quite a lot has been written about procedural inconsistencies in Broadchurch\u2019s court scenes \u2013 and there will doubtless be some views about whether DS Miller would be made to testify against her husband. (I had been wondering about this very thing.) But for dramatic reasons, we had to see Ellie tell her side of the story: pleading across court to her former best friends; putting her love for Joe firmly in the past tense. Whenever you start to doubt Broadchurch, Olivia Colman arrives on screen, and reminds you what makes it so compelling. Her performance on the witness stand would have convinced me, at any rate. I know I mentioned this last week, but it\u2019s worth repeating. Colman playing against Eve Myles is great to watch. The actors seem to bring out the best in each other: their (almost) burgeoning friendship has a real joy to it, even if Claire is lying through her teeth and Ellie is trying to trap her into revealing the truth. In other circumstances, you feel as if they really could have been been friends. Miller is doing her best, of course, to maintain some friendship with the Latimers. Beth, however, even with waters breaking, contractions getting more frequent, and nobody else to help, would rather never see her former friend again. But possibly this second series of Broadchurch is missing the opportunity to sit with that situation for a little while, and explore it. We\u2019re seeing increasingly less of those relationships that tie a community together. I\u2019m sure Sharon\u2019s imprisoned son, Jocelyn\u2019s car accident, and her inability to pay for her mother\u2019s care will all prove to be important. But what with Beth giving birth, Ellie trying to get over Joe with rubbish drunk sex, and Sandbrook, of course, it feels as if everyday interaction between the town\u2019s residents and their families is suffering at the hands of plot. That moment between Chloe and Ellie on the stairs while Beth was in labour was great, while the exchange between Mark and the vicar was sharp, too. More of them, please. Sandbrook If last week\u2019s meeting between Lee and Claire that had them escaping out of a window wasn\u2019t frustrating enough, this week\u2019s conclusion of the cliffhanger \u2013 they just went back to Claire\u2019s house after finding the not-very-well-hidden cameras \u2013 was more so. Writer Chris Chibnall clearly wanted to give Lee a complaint about Alec that would lead to an apology and introduce an element of doubt over Claire\u2019s relationship with her ex-husband, but surely there were less melodramatic ways to get there. If Chibnall had wanted to reinvestigate Sandbrook, I find myself wishing he had dedicated this series to doing just that. I understand the dramatic strength of having Ellie and Claire treading similar paths but with very different stories behind them \u2013 so the suggestion in court that it could have been Ellie emailing from Joe\u2019s computer, for instance, underlines Hardy\u2019s question about the pendent \u2013 but as it is, we\u2019re cycling through possibilities and suspects in this case, without actually knowing anything much about the crime. So Lee, super-cocky in his vest and roll-up, brandishing a giant sledgehammer, makes Hardy say sorry and then turns up at the detective\u2019s house with a big old file of paperwork on possible suspects the Gillespies to prove his innocence. Claire, meanwhile, with her inconsistent stories and mystery bluebell, is recast not as a witness in protection, but a suspect in danger of absconding. Which feels a clever twist \u2013 along with Hardy getting Miller to see if she independently came to the same conclusion \u2013 but we\u2019ve got there in three episodes in which Sandbrook hasn\u2019t even been the main focus. I\u2019m dying for the show to take a bit of a breath and calm itself down a little. Score watch No wonder Ellie was shouting at the court by the end of the episode. It was the only way she could make herself heard. Thoughts and observations \u2022 This courtroom exchange was great, even if the judge didn\u2019t think so: \u201cHow was your sex life?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, how would you describe yours?\u201d \u201cNot frequent enough, to be honest.\u201d \u2022 Can you get bluebells in France? Yes. Here\u2019s a handy guide to bluebells of the world for you. \u2022 If Hardy had realised the suspect might be Claire not Lee, why was he so worried about her safety that he made Miller hand over her car? Or was it simply that Claire had done a runner? (Which she could surely do all the time he\u2019s at work?) \u2022 A urine test for Rohypnol can be effective up to 60 hours after the drug is ingested \u2013 presumably if Claire had given the police this version of events at the time they would have been able to check its veracity. \u2022 It looked as if Hardy\u2019s dangerous health condition had mysteriously cleared up. But apparently not. \u2022 In case you didn\u2019t see Mark Lawson\u2019s piece on whether the current Broadchurch backlash is justified, you can read it here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
