Every day at lunchtime, a full house of punters - a couple of dozen or so - would squeeze inside to listen to jumps races from Bangor and Newton Abbot on the Extel blower. It was a warm, atmospheric place, not least when it was raining outside. There we would stand, shoulder to shoulder, and as body heat got to work, clouds of steam would rise from our clothes and mingle with the fag smoke against the nicotine-yellow ceiling, coating the one small window with condensation, as we all stared intently at the loudspeaker on the wall. When I think of it now, it feels like a lifetime ago. But no, it really was 1987. What would we have made of the betting shop of today? Live coverage of every race, wide-open spaces, comfy chairs, air conditioning, stainless-steel fixtures and fittings, snack bars and coffee machines, and sometimes even a little natural light through the large, clear windows at the front. In most shops, it's true, the cigarette smog remains, but in every other respect, they have changed beyond recognition in the space of a decade and a half. And now - as of yesterday, in fact - betting shops are allowed to serve hot food. Ladbrokes celebrated the latest step in deregulation in their flagship shop near Trafalgar Square, inviting John McCririck to dress up as a chef and cook spaghetti bolognaise for some understandably wary punters. The thought of sticky strands of pasta and gobbets of minced beef congealing slowly in McCririck's whiskers should be enough to put anyone off their lunch, not to mention their afternoon's betting, but Ladbrokes' PR department seemed to feel it all went rather well. Quite where this will all end is anyone's guess. At their current rate of mutation, the average betting office will be a four-star restaurant with some gee-gees thrown in within another 10 years or so. The old timers, the 50p-a-race punters who sit in the same seat for eight hours a day, six days a week, might not like it, but it would open up some interesting possibilities. Picasso, after all, was supposed to pay his restaurant bills by doodling on napkins. The punter of 2012 will be able to run up a \u00a350 bill for lunch with wine, then hand the waiter a \u00a35 note and a slip for a 12-1 chance in the 3.20 at Wolverhampton. And hey, you'll say, be sure to keep the change. Next thing you know, there will be couples enjoying a bottle of Sancerre over a candlelit dinner while you're trying to watch the evening meeting at Sandown. And then, inevitably, the day will come when you will decide to pop into Corals to punt a swift tenner and a sniffy man on the door will ask you if you've booked. No? Oh dear. I'm terribly sorry, sir, we're full. But we could maybe fit you in at 12 on Tuesday, if you don't mind sitting next to the toilet. Fortunately, there is a small army of people who will probably ensure that the more things change, the more they will stay the same. Rewind two paragraphs and there they are: the old timers, the proud veterans of many campaigns on the Flat and over jumps, who seem to come as part of the standard fixtures, along with the ashtrays and the bandit screens. Because the strange thing about every attempt to smarten up betting shops, to make them gleaming and slick and corporate and welcoming, is that no matter what the clever people in marketing do, the punters stay the same. Whenever one generation passes on, it is replaced by another, identical collection of chancers and solace-seekers, lads, scallies and pensioners, and people who just have nothing better to do. And long may it continue. As the rest of the high street succumbs to the tide of Starbucks and McDonalds, the betting shop feels ever more like the small village in Gaul where Asterix and the rest stood up to the Romans. The whole lot of them deserve listed status (and the same goes for the betting shops too). Even if the betting chains finally winkle them out and pull in a different sort of punter with their new range of legal creature comforts, then please come and join me at the shop I'll be opening somewhere in the City. There will be no TVs nor toilets, no food nor drink, a steep climb to the 10-foot-square room at the top, and the humidity will be guaranteed 100%. Just remember that if there's more than two dozen of you, you'll have to take turns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
