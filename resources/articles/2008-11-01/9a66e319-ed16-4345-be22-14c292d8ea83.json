I'm talking, of course, of \"Rashid the Respected Palestinian Scholar\", aka Rashid Khalidi, the Columbia university professor who, I can exclusively reveal, does not hold an Ohio plumbing license. (But who did, we learned, co-found an organisation that received hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant money from a foundation chaired by John McCain.) Awkwardly, however, McCain's use of Khalidi in his campaigning seems to have triggered a concerted effort to purchase copies of the professor's largely well-received book, The Iron Cage: The Story Of The Palestinian Struggle For Statehood, which is now at 122 in Amazon.com's ranking of all books sold. The election-season re-release of McCain's Faith of My Fathers, by contrast, is at 2,600. This is amusing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
