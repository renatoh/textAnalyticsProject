It has no place in a liberal society. So it is hard to oppose a bill to end modern slavery , as announced by the home secretary, Theresa May, in August, and again in October and finally revealed in draft form on Monday. This is a government that really is going to act \u2013 before the next election, according to Mrs May \u2013 on a great contemporary evil. Sadly, there is less to this proposal than meets the eye. The danger is that, under the guise of doing something, on the ground it will do nothing to end slavery or the cruel injustice of poverty wages that it underpins. Slavery is an emotive word. Even its exact definition can be slippery: slavery for the Wilberforce Institute implies ownership. Some recognise that honour and debt can be translated into coercion. Others use it to describe trafficking. But at its heart is a complex political problem that is beyond easy measurement. Estimates are conjecture. Most years there are fewer than a hundred convictions, and the range of people affected may be somewhere \"in the low thousands\" or as many as 10,000. It depends on the source. Mrs May's bill is not entirely without merit. An anti-slavery commissioner who can pull together the evidence and focus sustained attention on forced labour and people trafficking is a constructive move. Trying to build a proper database by imposing a legal obligation to report all encounters with people who may have been trafficked or who are trapped in forced labour should lead to better training and a greater awareness, and ultimately to a more reliable database of the numbers. A better understanding of both the scale and the nature of modern slavery must be at the basis of any attempt to end it. But Mrs May's critics \u2013 and these may well come to include the Labour MP Frank Field, whose own study of the problem made some serious recommendations to which the home secretary has yet to respond \u2013 argue that much of the legislative framework exists. While drawing it all together as the white paper proposes could produce a more effective attack, it is sleight of hand to pretend it will make a real difference. The contours of the biggest part of the problem are already familiar. The most widespread forced labour takes place in agriculture, food processing and construction. At the top of Mr Field's list of recommendations was one to extend the remit and enhance the resources of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, the body set up in the wake of the Morecambe Bay cockle fishing tragedy. But it was a body set up, some campaigners believed, to fail, with too little money and too narrow a remit. Last week, for the first time in its eight-year history, it secured a conviction that carried a jail sentence. Audrias Morkunas, who operated without a licence in Norfolk, forcing fellow Lithuanians to work for tiny amounts of money by physical threats and charging extortionate amounts for rent, was sentenced to a total of seven years in prison. But the GLA's funding is being cut by 17% between 2011 and 2014, and under the coalition's red tape challenge its powers have been chiselled back. There are two reasons why people end up in some form of slavery. One is that their rights are not properly safeguarded. Strengthening the GLA would be one highly effective way of providing better protection. Enforcing other laws could be even more effective \u2013 upholding the minimum wage, ending zero-hours contracts that prevent anyone with caring responsibilities taking a job, and stricter enforcement of housing regulations to stop multi-occupancy could transform some of the communities at the sharpest end of the slave-wage economy. The other is attitudes to migration. Many people trapped in forced labour are here legally, but are treated with suspicion. There is also growing evidence of domestic slavery because the new tied-visa requirement for domestic workers makes exploitation easy. This is the business model that underpins slavery. A government serious about ending it should start here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
