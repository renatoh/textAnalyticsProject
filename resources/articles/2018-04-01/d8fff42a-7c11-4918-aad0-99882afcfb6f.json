A chord is played that seeps through the beer and banter and strikes something soul-deep. Bodies swivel. Glasses are raised high; mouths open in a chorus of shared exclamation. Groups become a crowd. Strangers are made suddenly familiar. We\u2019re not going to sit in silence. We\u2019re not going to live in fear. And we all know it. When we saw our prime minister swaying awkwardly this week, seemingly unable to recall the words to You\u2019re the Voice, it set off a bemused national vibration, and not just for the easy political hit. When he then flubbed the lines on radio, it became a moment \u2013 because these songs seemingly eclipse those things that separate us. How could our leaders have missed that moment, when the world came in to build a wall between us, and we knew they wouldn\u2019t win? That moment when an anonymous group of people, united by nothing more than shared knowledge of a string of words, surge together to sing a lyric as loud as they can, transcends differences. Where you grew up and how. Who you vote for. What you support and why. How you plan on moving forward. When that piano starts, we all know we left our heart with the sappers round Khe Sanh. We know, just by the strum of a guitar, if you\u2019ll throw your arms around me or if we have to run to paradise. Minds slip back to car trips, the sound of muffled hooks snaking from under older siblings\u2019 doors, to first-drink experiences, bonfires, salty summers, or school pick-ups where the radio dial seemed cemented to the golden oldies. Did we ever really learn the words? Or did we open our mouths one day and they appeared, part of the indelible experience of sharing Australia? Will we ever see these faces again? For that moment \u2013 wedged between sweaty armpits, jostled and jerked, the crowd moving without any semblance of rhythm, instead shaken by a careless joy \u2013 none of it matters. It\u2019s a long way to the top and it\u2019s harder than it looks, but for that moment, it doesn\u2019t matter. Not politics, heartache, yesterdays or tomorrows. Not the spilt beer on your new clothes, the squashed toe, the rent, the missed assignment or job hunt. In those moments, short and sparse as they are, we are glorious. The pub anthem, that elusive Aussie rock song that transcends generations and socioeconomic divides, geographical distances and ideologies, can\u2019t be forced. That\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to be, little darling. Why a dozen or so songs, released over the past four or so decades, managed to seep into the national consciousness is a conversation in itself. How do we sleep while our beds are burning? What\u2019s your scene? When we\u2019re overseas, it\u2019s a flute melody, telling us about a land down under. But when we\u2019re at home, when the boys are in town, you can walk to her door, and she might tell you that you don\u2019t make her feel like she\u2019s a woman anymore. And you\u2019ll know exactly what it means. Why these songs crossed boundaries has never mattered. They did. They unite us in strained vocal cords and missed lyrics and knowing smiles when the last plane out of Sydney line gets there. They\u2019ve become part of the patchwork of the national experience, the familiar in the unknown, something to unify the usually divided. It\u2019s why seeing a leader flub something that seems so intrinsically obvious to so many can seem so jarring. These songs aren\u2019t universal. They\u2019re just ours. We don\u2019t know every line, but the ones we do take us places. We\u2019ll never agree on a perfect top 10, but we\u2019ll share a smile over at least the same six. In those moments, sharing sweat and song with strangers, there\u2019s no change, there\u2019s no pace. Everything is in its place. And it\u2019s with all of us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
