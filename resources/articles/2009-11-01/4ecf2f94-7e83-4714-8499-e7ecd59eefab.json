Even the latest rescue act involving Steven Gerrard was tinged with regret and no shortage of controversy. The Liverpool captain answered his manager's call and his club's prayers to return from the groin problem that had sidelined him for the previous four matches and donned his familiar talisman cloak within 25 minutes of his return. For once luck was on Ben\u00edtez's side in the ludicrous penalty that Peter Walton awarded against the visitors and Gerrard converted but it was insufficient. Liverpool had momentum, their captain and their chances, and Gerrard was central to their second-half recovery. This time, however, an international break cannot come quickly enough for the Liverpool manager. Joe Hart's goal was under siege by the time David Ngog leapt over Lee Carsley's challenge and Gerrard, who had earlier struck a post with a header from Glen Johnson's delightful cross, sent the on-loan keeper the wrong way from the penalty spot. Alex McLeish will rightly rage against the injustice of Walton's decision. Given his recent trials, Ben\u00edtez will not care. Liverpool's performance, indeed their entire season, was in need of the lift that Gerrard at least was able to give the crowd when he replaced the distraught Albert Riera in the 45th minute. The tale of the first half was in keeping with the club's campaign \u2013 a promising opening, several gilt-edged chances squandered, more injuries and conceding late on. Ben\u00edtez's fortunes with the catalogue of injuries that have deepened Liverpool's gloom appeared to be rising when he named five players in his starting line-up who were absent for the previous league defeat at Fulham. Daniel Agger, Martin Skrtel, Johnson, Ngog and Riera brought respite for the manager even with Fernando Torres out and Gerrard on the bench, although it was instructive of the club's mood that Anfield's loudest cheers before kick-off were reserved for two of the substitutes, the captain and the \u00a320m summer signing, Alberto Aquilani. Liverpool's dominant, encouraging start was beginning to fade into memory when Riera seized up inside the Birmingham area moments before the interval. The immediate reaction was to assume the Spain international was offering a distraction for another wasteful moment in front of Hart's goal, with the home crowd becoming increasingly and understandably irate at Liverpool's inability to kill off this contest. Riera's pained reaction, gripping the left hamstring that had kept him out for almost a month, told otherwise. Within seconds of the substitution Cameron Jerome, with his stunning 30-yard strike, had heightened the sense that anything that can go wrong for Ben\u00edtez will do so . Arguably the Liverpool manager's greatest frustration was reserved for the minimal impact from those he has to rely upon in such depleted times, such as Yossi Benayoun and Dirk Kuyt. Riera would have joined that list had he not been patently short of match fitness. While Johnson immediately reaffirmed his importance to Liverpool's system with a productive display from right-back, creating the first goal with a mazy run between Liam Ridgewell and James McFadden that he would later repeat, Benayoun was largely consigned to the margins. Ben\u00edtez had made a point of emphasising the Israel captain's responsibility, intelligence and growing influence in the absence of Gerrard and Torres before kick-off but his tribute was not repaid. \"Yossi is a key player for us,\" Ben\u00edtez had said of a player transformed at Anfield this year. \"There was a time before when people had some doubts about him but we knew he always had quality. We knew he could have an influence and change a game. He is intelligent and players don't know what he is going to do the next time he gets the ball. That's a big difference and when you don't have Steven on the pitch, it's important we have Yossi.\" The second half brought the response Ben\u00edtez needed, although it required an outrageous dive from Ngog to turn Liverpool's fortunes. Gerrard began warming up for the second half long before his team-mates and his early, restricted movements showed why. As his influence grew, however, so Benayoun, Kuyt and Javier Mascherano began to respond."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
