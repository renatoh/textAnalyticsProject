The 19-year-old, who was subject of late interest from Liverpool and Celta Vigo, passed a medical yesterday after the clubs agreed terms on Wednesday. \"The consensus is that he's the best young player in the world at the moment,\" said the chairman Freddy Shepherd. \"He's a left-sided midfielder, just the player [the manager] Bobby Robson wants to spearhead our Champions League bid.\" Viana has four full caps and played for Portugal in last month's European Under-21 championship before being called into the World Cup squad as a late replacement for Daniel Kenedy, who failed a drug test, although he did not feature. Portsmouth's manager Harry Redknapp is close to signing the goalkeeper Shaka Hislop again, this time on a free from West Ham, where he arrived from Newcastle in 1998. Pompey, who are also hopeful of bringing their former manager Jim Smith back as Redknapp's No2, have been handed a \u00a330,000 fine, suspended until next summer, after finishing last season with the country's worst disciplinary record, 96 yellow cards and six reds. Manchester City have been told that they have no grounds for appeal against a four-match suspension Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 incurred when playing for West Ham. The midfielder was sent off twice late in the 1999-2000 season but joined Lyon for \u00a36m that summer. Philippe Troussier, the former Japan coach, has expressed an interest in the France post should Roger Lemerre resign. \"No one has ever contacted me,\" he said. \"But of course that would be an offer which I would be unable to refuse.\" Senegal's coach Bruno Metsu has accused Turkey of a lack of respect. \"They are very sure of themselves,\" he said. \"They aren't even talking about Saturday's quarter-final match against Senegal, they are already talking about the outcome of the Brazil-England game. It's not so much over-confidence; they have been denigrating us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
