After the former Quins half-back Danny Orr had steered Castleford to an attritional 18-12 victory over Huddersfield on Saturday, his old club maintained their impressive start under their previously unknown coach, Rob Powell, by beating Crusaders 20-18 at a muddy and worryingly empty Stoop. Luke Dorn scored two tries and Luke Gale, who scored 10 of his side's 11 points against Catalans last weekend, collected another 12 from a try and four goals. Warrington bounced back from their opening defeat by Huddersfield with Brett Hodgson converting his own 78th-minute try to snatch a 24-22 victory over Hull KR. Wakefield Trinity made the perfect start following last week's takeover with a completely unexpected 38-14 win against Catalan Dragons in Perpignan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
