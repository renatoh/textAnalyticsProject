Abraham sustained the injury against Arsenal in January when he slipped and banged into the advertising boards at Stamford Bridge but, with Lampard having used his three substitutions, he battled on. There were fears of a hairline fracture, although scans were clear, and Abraham started Chelsea\u2019s next Premier League game at Leicester after a pain-killing injection only to feel discomfort again. He missed the Manchester United game before he played as a substitute against Tottenham and Bayern Munich. In the latter game, he took a knock from J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng and, having continued, seemed to pull up in the post-match warm-down. It was easy to detect the frustration in Lampard as he discussed the situation, which will doubtless be felt, too, by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, who has two of his other strikers \u2013 Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford \u2013 out with long-term injuries. \u201cTammy is not active for the next couple of days,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHow long is he going to be out? I don\u2019t know. The inflammation is causing pain, so we are looking at ways to get rid of it. Could surgery be an option? As far as I know, no. It\u2019s certainly not been mentioned. \u201cIt\u2019s a month later [from the Arsenal game] and we\u2019re still talking about it so it\u2019s been a frustrating one. We have seen him come back and then go away again. Sometimes things that are [to do with] pain threshold are like that. If he is not comfortable, he has to come out for a few days at least and see where it is going.\u201d Lampard was more plainly annoyed at Willian, who is out of contract in the summer and suggested on Tuesday that he could leave. Negotiations over a new deal are deadlocked, with the 31-year-old wanting three years and Chelsea offering two. \u201cSome of the headlines this week had a slight sense of frustration for me because we are working day to day to finish the job this season and we are not jumping ahead to the summer,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing conversation, so maybe not ideal timing [from Willian]. It\u2019s not over. We\u2019ll see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
