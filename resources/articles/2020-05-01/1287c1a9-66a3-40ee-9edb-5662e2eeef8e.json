The Tottenham midfielder was held at knifepoint and punched after burglars broke in during the early hours of Wednesday morning. The 24-year-old was hit in the face during the terrifying incident but has not sustained serious injuries. Alli has been isolating with his brother and their respective partners. Two men broke into the property just after midnight on Wednesday morning and threatened the England international. He sustained a facial injury before the intruders fled. \u201cThank you for all the messages,\u201d Alli posted on Twitter. \u201cHorrible experience but we\u2019re all okay now. Appreciate the support.\u201d The attackers took numerous items from the house including jewellery and watches. Police are understood to be reviewing CCTV footage of the incident in Hadley Wood. The Metropolitan police said: \u201cPolice were called at approximately 00:35 on Wednesday 13 May to reports of a robbery at a residential address in Barnet. \u201cTwo males gained entry to the property and stole items of jewellery, including watches, before fleeing. One male occupant of the property, aged in his 20s, suffered a minor facial injury after being assaulted. He did not require hospital treatment. No arrests; enquiries into the circumstances continue.\u201d A Spurs spokesperson added: \u201cWe have been offering our support to Dele and those isolating with him. We encourage anyone with any information to help the police with their investigation to come forward.\u201d Alli and his Spurs teammates are in the process of meeting the Premier League over Project Restart as they work towards a return to action next month. The latest raid comes two months after Jan Vertonghen\u2019s family was robbed at knifepoint while Alli\u2019s Tottenham teammate was away on Champions League duty. Vertonghen was part of the squad who travelled to Germany for the last-16 second leg against RB Leipzig in March when four thieves wearing balaclavas raided his home. They were armed with knives, but Vertonghen\u2019s wife and two children were unharmed. In November Ashley Smith was jailed for 10 years for attempting to rob Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac of luxury watches worth \u00a3200,000. Smith and his accomplice, who were both armed with improvised blades during the incident last July, were fought off by Kolasinac. \u00d6zil, whose wife was in the car, drove the players from the ambush. The would-be robbers pursued the Gunners pair on a stolen moped and threw stones at their vehicle causing \u201csignificant\u201d damage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
