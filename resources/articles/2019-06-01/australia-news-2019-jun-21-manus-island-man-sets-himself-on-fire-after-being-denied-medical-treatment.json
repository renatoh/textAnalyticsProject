The incident occurred at Hillside Haus, one of three accomodation blocks in Lorengau, which house the hundreds of asylum seeker and refugee men sent there under Australia\u2019s offshore processing policy. Photographs show a significant blaze in one building, attended to by immigration officers and police with fire extinguishers and hoses. Manus-based refugee Shamindan Kanapadhi said a man had set himself on fire inside his room. \u201cHe has been suffering with severe health issues and his medical treatment has been denied for a long time,\u201d Kanapadhi said. \u201cToday he went to the PIH clinic to get some help but they didn\u2019t help him and he was very stressed.\u201d One of the man\u2019s friends who lives with him at Hillside Haus told Guardian Australia the man had locked himself inside his room before the blaze began. \u201cThe security guards arrived to break the door and couldn\u2019t [so] I helped with some other guys and we broke the door, took him from inside,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see him he can\u2019t speak, [his] face, forehead, left cheek, right cheek, very badly burned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how he did [the] fire because I was outside with security. The whole thing was five, 10 minutes.\u201d The two men have been on on Manus for six years. \u201cWe are like brothers,\u201d the man\u2019s friend said. \u201cWhen I saw the fire I was very scared. I thought today I lost him.\u201d He said the man had been returned to hospital by Manus security after the blaze was extinguished. It comes during extraordinarily tense times on Manus Island, as refugees and asylum seekers continue to protest against their conditions, and delays in processing their US resettlement claims. A mental health crisis continues to worsen, with more than 90 acts of self-harm and suicide attempts since Australia\u2019s federal election. \u201cWhile the home affairs minister spends his time arguing to repeal the medevac bill, the situation on Manus spins out of control,\u201d said Ian Rintoul, spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition. On Thursday, a man climbed a mobile phone tower and stayed there for several hours, saying he had his final interview with US representatives two years ago and was yet to receive an answer. \u201cRight now at least 55 people in Manus and Port Moresby are waiting for that result from America,\u201d journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani said. \u201cThey are all different nationalities. At least 20 from Iran, six from Pakistan, and one person from Sri Lanka. Ten from Sudan and five from Afghanistan and four from Somalia, and one Bangladeshi. \u201cThe process with America is really like a torture for people \u2013 they don\u2019t talk to people in detention and don\u2019t give results.\u201d More than 500 people have been resettled in the US from Manus and Nauru, with several hundred others rejected. On Sunday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, acknowledged that the US was unlikely to reach the maximum number of resettlements it agreed to as part of the deal with Australia, of 1,250 people. Last week a Somali man set himself alight at the East Lorengau camp.
