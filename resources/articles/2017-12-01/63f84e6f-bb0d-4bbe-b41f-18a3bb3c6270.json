On another difficult day for the struggling Saints, Wales also brushed off the club\u2019s attempts to lure Warren Gatland to Franklin\u2019s Gardens. Mallinder was sacked on 12 December after a decade at the club but on Sunday Northampton\u2019s losing run in the Premiership and Champions Cup extended to nine matches. Recent results \u2013 and the steady decline since winning the Premiership in 2014 \u2013 have led to several former players voicing opinions over where Saints have gone wrong, with the former England wing Ian Hunter pointing the finger at the forwards coach, Dorian West, last week. Asked about comments made by former Northampton players on social media, Hartley said: \u201cI\u2019d tread lightly on that sort of stuff and unless you were sat in our changing room, in our kit, I don\u2019t think you should take any opinion or advice from people who are not in our group. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair unless they know and if you\u2019re not sat in our changing room you don\u2019t know. And at a time like this, when you haven\u2019t had a win, it\u2019s easy for people to point fingers, especially if you\u2019re not involved.\u201d Hartley did acknowledge that the current Northampton squad, who face the champions, Exeter, on Saturday must take responsibility for their plight, as well as for Mallinder\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to look other than ourselves for improvement and results now. The spotlight is on us. We\u2019ve been through periods like this before and it is rough but we\u2019ll come out the other side of it. Four seasons ago we were at this stage at Christmas time and then as the close of the season came we had to win every game to make the top four. We ended up doing it, so it\u2019s do-able, there is a way out.\u201d Wales, meanwhile, have told Northampton to forget about attempting to bring Gatland to the club. The president, Keith Barwell, said this week that they had shortlisted Gatland before appointing Mallinder 10 years ago and that the Wales head coach, who also led the British &amp; Irish Lions on their past two tours, was someone in whom the Saints are interested. \u201cI did not lose a beat to be honest,\u201d the Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, Martyn Phillips, said when asked for his reaction to Barwell\u2019s remarks. \u201cWarren is going to get linked to all sorts of jobs because he is one of the top coaches in the world. There are so few people on that list that those who are will be talked about a lot. I would like to believe he will be here for the World Cup [in 2019].\u201d Gatland\u2019s contract with Wales lasts until the end of that tournament and a three-man shortlist has been drawn up for his successor. It would cost Northampton a seven\u2011figure sum to buy Gatland out of it because as well as his salary, he will receive a bonus if he sees out his time in the country he moved to 10 years ago. Whoever takes over from him \u2013 Glasgow\u2019s head coach, Dave Rennie, is the favourite \u2013 will be expected to work closely with the country\u2019s four regions. Phillips said that the professional end of the game was now made up of five interdependent bodies, Wales and the quartet, a contrast to the previous WRU regime which erected a barrier between the national side and those under it. \u201cIt is important that the successful candidate sees the big picture,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWe want a pretty rounded individual, not just a great coach, although it is important that he has a track record and has won something important, and nationality is not an issue. We have a shortlist of three and they all have to buy into our model: it is not random any more.\u201d Phillips also said the WRU is considering making a part of the Principality Stadium an alcohol-free zone after the next Six Nations following complaints from spectators last month about fans constantly getting up during the match to go to the bar or the toilet. \u201cWe are collecting data from spectators and if there are things we think we can do to improve the experience for people, we\u2019ll trial those next autumn, but I don\u2019t want to penalise one group against another,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
