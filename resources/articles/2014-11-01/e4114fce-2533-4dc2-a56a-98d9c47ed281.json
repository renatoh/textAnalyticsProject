There were no cakes or candles for Ferouz\u2019s birthday, his father told Guardian Australia, saying it was all he could do to try to raise a smile from his youngest son. The father of three said his family had grown increasingly despondent with the monotony of life in detention and uncertainty about their fates. They wait in legal limbo as lawyers fight to keep Ferouz, who was born in Brisbane but treated as an unauthorised arrival by immigration officials, in Australia. Ferouz\u2019s father, whom Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, spoke by phone through an interpreter on the child\u2019s birthday on Thursday last week. \u201cI wanted to have at least a cake and do something with the whole family, the children and others and make a happy birthday, celebrate his birthday,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in here, we don\u2019t have anything actually to do. \u201cSo what I did this morning when we woke up, because I can\u2019t celebrate anything here, I just looked at him and gave a laugh to him. That\u2019s it.\u201d A report last year by child refugee advocate group Chilout argued the regime in the centre \u201cdestroys the family unit and makes pro-active parenting nearly impossible\u201d. \u201cChildren are witnessing the mental anguish of their parents, parents are unable to work, no adult is furthering their education, a parent cannot even make their child\u2019s breakfast,\u201d it said. It quoted a centre staffer: \u201cThere are the mental health issues people arrive with and then there are the ones they acquire whilst they\u2019re here.\u201d Ferouz, whose family is from the persecuted Rohingyan minority of Burma, had grown into a playful toddler who was starting to walk, said his father. \u201cOnce he starts playing, he feels happy. I take him around inside the camp and go all the way around. You can\u2019t go anywhere else,\u201d he said. But the man said he felt increasingly hopeless, concerned about the mental and physical health of his family after prolonged detention. \u201cWhen I see my children and my wife, I feel very sad,\u201d he said. \u201cMy children are not happy because they\u2019ve been a long time here. If it was one or two months, fine, but it has been more than a year now.\u201d The man said he was particularly worried for Ferouz\u2019s seven-year-old sister who has an intellectual disability and persistent health concerns including stomach problems. His wife has diabetes, exacerbated by the stress of their situation, and problems with her leg. Ferouz himself has had an ulcer on his tongue for a month. \u201cThey give some medication but it doesn\u2019t help,\u201d his father said. Concerns about the family\u2019s health are what make him fear a return to Nauru, where immigration staff have repeatedly told him his family are to be sent. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not happy to go to Nauru is my child\u2019s health, she will not have good treatment there,\u201d the man said. \u201cThe hospital is very limited, we\u2019ve been to the hospital as well and it\u2019s very difficult to get admitted, get treatment.\u201d Before Ferouz was born, his family were in offshore detention on Nauru. Medical concerns during pregnancy prompted their transfer to Brisbane, where Ferouz was born in the Mater hospital. Ferouz has a Queensland birth certificate but a federal court judge last month ruled his \u201carrival\u201d in Australia was unauthorised because his parents were asylum seekers without valid visas. A legal team working pro bono, led by Maurice Blackburn\u2019s Murray Watt, has appealed against that decision, which looms as a precedent for about 100 other Australian-born children. Watt said even if the appeal was successful, parts of a new immigration bill before federal parliament would retrospectively overrule the court\u2019s decision. Ferouz still has a citizenship application pending. What made life in Darwin harder to bear, Ferouz\u2019s father said, was that those inside were divided into two groups, the hope-filled and the hopeless. \u201cSome are very happy because they are going outside into the community, and some of them are very sad because they have to go [offshore],\u201d he said. He said it was particularly hard seeing another family who arrived on the same day who were now \u201cvery happy and they\u2019re going out\u201d. \u201cBut how come we\u2019re hearing all the time \u2018you have to go to Nauru\u2019? What\u2019s the difference with us?\u201d According to the Chilout report, the Darwin centre held 338 children, nearly half of all children in detention by the Australian government. That included eight boys without their families and another 50 pregnant women. Watt said the long-term psychiatric harm caused especially to children held in detention had been documented in \u201cmany reports from independent doctors\u201d. He said the detention of nearly 800 children, each on average for more than 14 months, had cost taxpayers hundred of millions of dollars \u2013 $1m in the case of Ferouz and his family alone. Watt condemned the government\u2019s treatment of the children and called on the federal Senate to block the legislation that would put protection visas out of reach of Ferouz and 100 other Australian-born children. Ferouz\u2019s appeal against the federal court ruling that upheld the federal government\u2019s decision will be heard on 24 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
