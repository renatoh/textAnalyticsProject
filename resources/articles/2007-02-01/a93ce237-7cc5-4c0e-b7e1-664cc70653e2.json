Why, back in 2000 it was the considered opinion of the soon-to-be MP for Witney that scrapping Section 28 was part of a \"deeply unpopular ... fringe agenda\", and that St Tony had not only \"moved heaven and earth to allow the promotion of homosexuality in schools\", but also removed \"the last recognition of marriage in the tax system\" by abolishing the married couples' tax allowance. What's more, two years later, Dave actually voted against gay adoption, and then for an amendment to allow all unmarried couples except gays to adopt. So hasn't he done well! Now here's a thing. Comely, expletive-rich comic and curmudgeon Arthur Smith was, we're told, a most promising prankster in his days at the much underrated University of East Anglia. Except his name was Brian. Why, one wonders, would anyone change their name from the dull and slightly d\u00e9mod\u00e9 Brian to the dull and slightly d\u00e9mod\u00e9 Arthur? Any ideas? What a stroke of good fortune! Colin Challen, Labour MP for Morley and Rothwell and founding chairman of the all-party parliamentary climate change group, is stepping down at the next election to campaign, with retiring Treasury honcho Sir Nicholas Stern, for a \"new international environmental agreement\". Just as well, really, because both his constituency and nearby Normanton are being abolished to make way for a new one, Morley and Outwood, and for a brief moment there it looked very much like two sitting Labour MPs were going to be slugging it out for one seat. Happily, however, the hon member for Normanton happens to be young Ed Balls, economic secretary to the Treasury, Mr G Broon's right-hand man, and possible future chancellor. So the problem never arose. Steph Booth, St Tony's adoring (and, let's be honest, adorable) stepmum-in-law, is in touch with a few kindly words for her Cherie's sister, Lauren, who's penned a splendid piece in the Mail advising women of a certain age to give up trying to look good and embrace the signs of advancing age. \"While there's a point where self-respect might tip over into vanity,\" says dear Steph in her best wicked stepmother outfit, \"suggesting we should become overweight, scruffy slobs as soon as we leave the first flush of youth behind is, I feel, a little excessive. But where I think her argument really falls down is that despite everything she said, I note her hair still maintains that particular yellow glow it has sustained for so many years. What, no grey hairs at all? My, how lucky she is...\" Which brings us to the alarming news, animal terrorism-wise, of the discovery of a \"strikingly unusual\" new mammal in the tree forests of southern Peru. Isothrix barbarabrownae, according to the New Scientist, described by its finders as a \"handsome novelty\", is most closely related to spiny rats, but looks similar to a squirrel. Obviously, we advise the greatest possible caution until we are aware exactly what its intentions are. \"Iraqi progress is encouraging,\" asserted gallant Des Browne on Tuesday in a breathless dispatch from the frontline. \"The Iraqi government is making encouraging strides in its efforts to curb violence in the country.\" Only 40 Shia pilgrims were butchered that day, we see, so on balance, we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. The sunlit uplands are in sight! A bit of a conundrum awaits our bold defence secretary, though, once he's sorted that war out. Kilmarnock Football Club, you see, are through to the final of the Scottish League Cup, and Des, as MP for that fair city, will have little choice but to attend the match - even if he is, in his own words, \"Celtic daft\", to the extent (it is widely rumoured) of having the team's crest tattooed upon his calf. What will the poor chap do? diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
