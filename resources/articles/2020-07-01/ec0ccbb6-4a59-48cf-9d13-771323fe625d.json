Gillespie made his United debut under Ferguson in 1993. Yet when Ferguson moved to sign Cole two years later from Newcastle, Gillespie was the makeweight in the transfer, being valued at \u00a31m. Gillespie was 19 and earning \u00a3230 a week and when it came to finalising his personal terms at Newcastle Ferguson became a temporary representative. \u201cWe got to the hotel, got on the hotel phone and I rang home,\u201d Gillespie told the United podcast. \u201cMy mum answered and I explained the situation and the manager comes on to her and said: \u2018Look, is it OK if I do the deal and act as his agent?\u2019 She said she was happy enough with that. And I remember the manager said to me: \u2018When we go in here, don\u2019t say a word.\u2019 \u201cWe were on \u00a3230 a week and the contract was going up to \u00a3250 a week the next year, but I remember sitting at a big round table with Sir Alex, Kevin Keegan [Newcastle\u2019s manager], Freddy Shepherd, the chairman, Freddie Fletcher, the chief executive. \u201cI was sat with my head down and remember Sir Alex going: \u2018Well, Keith\u2019s on \u00a3600 a week at the minute and we want you to double it to \u00a31,200.\u2019 I sort of looked up and he said [again]: \u2018\u00a3600,\u2019 and gave me this look as if to say: \u2018Don\u2019t say a word here.\u2019 And Newcastle agreed to it right away.\u201d Gillespie, who is now an agent, did not have a good experience with his first permanent one. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve played the game you know what a player expects from an agent. I only had two agents in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first one I had at Newcastle tried to rip me off when I moved to Blackburn [in 1998], so I changed agent and had the same one for the rest of my career and he became like a friend.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
