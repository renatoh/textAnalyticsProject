He planted a few trees in our city, but cut off all the investment and reduced the city to pauper status (Four authorities to test 'big society', 19 July). Yesterday David Cameron came north and told us to do what we want, only he wasn't going to pay for any of it ... probably because it's all been given to the banks. Steven Calrow Liverpool \u2022 May I congratulate the coalition for its fantastic success in bringing down unemployment and crime so quickly (Crime at lowest level for three decades, 16 July), while having to deal with a record deficit caused solely by the previous administration. Well done, chaps. Ian Parsons Bradford \u2022 I agree hand skills should be restored to the curriculum (Letters, 19 July).

Andrew Norman Poole, Dorset \u2022 I can tell Rufus cumes from oop north (Cryptic crossword, 19 July). \"Crux\" doesn't rhyme with \"crooks\" down the East End, where I come from.
