Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic airline had, he said, made a bad mistake launching a domestic service from Heathrow. \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is they are struggling \u2013 you can\u2019t make money flying planes that are less than half full. I said it would be a mistake \u2013 and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d A few days later, last Monday, those words proved prophetic as Branson announced that he was grounding the Little Red carrier permanently. So that\u2019s a point to BA and its parent company, International Airlines Group, in a long-running corporate rivalry that has seen both sides notch up notable victories. The bad blood goes back to the 1980s, to the early years of Virgin Atlantic, and peaked with \u201cdirty tricks\u201d claims that eventually saw BA pay damages of more than \u00a3600,000 to Branson and Virgin Atlantic in 1993. From the beginning, the entrepreneur positioned his airline as the challenger upstart to the might of BA. Echoes of this persist in the latest chapter with the Little Red closure. The mini-airline, which started flights from Heathrow to Manchester and Scotland only last year, owed its existence to the same gambit that gained Virgin its first foothold in the UK\u2019s main hub back in 1991. Competition authorities then, as 22 years later, concurred with Branson\u2019s lawyers\u2019 view that BA had too much market power at Heathrow, and forced the flag carrier to give up prized slots to its competitor. But whereas Virgin Atlantic went on from that point to become an established long-haul competitor, Little Red struggled in a short-haul market dominated by BA at Heathrow, and easyJet and Ryanair elsewhere. Little wonder that Walsh, who had accurately forecast Little Red\u2019s financial trouble, expressed glee at its demise. But Virgin argued that the competition authorities had granted it a totally inadequate number of slots at Heathrow. The odds, Branson said, \u201cwere stacked against us\u201d. With the demise of Little Red, the Heathrow slots will revert to BA \u2013 unless another contender wishes to give it a go. So the local skirmish is over, but the real battle continues elsewhere. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s defeat in its attempt to compete domestically with BA may have wounded its pride, but the cold logic for Little Red was not to unite the peoples of south and north Britain, but to bring the corporate travellers of Scotland and Manchester on to the Virgin international network. That network is now pointed firmly towards the US, ever since Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines bought 49% of Virgin Atlantic at the end of 2012. The hope is that the Delta will restore Virgin to fighting weight in the industry\u2019s most lucrative swath of sky \u2013 above the Atlantic between Heathrow and the US. This is a significant month for Virgin Atlantic and BA: both are rolling out new planes on US routes: Branson\u2019s first Dreamliner will start a regular service to Boston; and BA\u2019s A380 will begin flying to Washington. Last week BA marked four years of collaboration across the Atlantic with American Airlines in a joint venture that now generates revenues of almost $10bn a year. It was approved by competition authorities in 2010, despite bitter opposition from Virgin Atlantic. The subsequent merger of US Airways and American has further fattened the BA/AA joint business: the number of routes has grown from 50 to 88, and combined revenues are up by 50%. The deal allows the two airlines to co-ordinate slots \u2013 a practice Virgin had argued would be bad for consumers. Walsh counters that customers have benefited, particularly from a wider route network and more frequent flights \u2013 the airlines now provide 17 flights a day between New York and Heathrow \u2013 and says fare increases are due solely to rising fuel costs. \u201cAll of the evidence says the customer is doing very well,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe have spent more money on our product in the past four years than we had in the previous 10, because we know they have a great choice.\u201d Virgin Atlantic, one of the last major long-haul carriers not to join an airline alliance, fell into the open arms of Delta, the US\u2019s second-largest carrier. Insiders say Branson was scanning for a partner for some time before the BA/AA tie-up, confirmed in 2010, turned up the pressure on him. With Delta, Virgin Atlantic now has nine flights a day on the world\u2019s key business-travel route \u2013 to New York from Heathrow. It is still smaller than BA/AA, but edging closer. Analysts say the tie-up improves Virgin Atlantic in terms of size, breadth of network and number of flights. The deal also helps Virgin Atlantic sell tickets in America\u2019s corporate market, where Delta is a household name. But those brought up on the Branson swashbuckle may feel this comes at a high cost. Sitting in his new Airbus at 35,000ft, Walsh also claimed that Branson\u2019s airline was \u201ccontrolled by Delta\u201d. This dig was a nod to a European commission investigation into the ownership of Virgin Atlantic by a non-EU carrier. Delta\u2019s 49% stake is at the limit of foreign ownership rules, but the shareholder is not exercising control. Virgin chief executive Craig Kreeger said he was not unduly concerned at this: \u201cWe are very confident that Virgin is run by us.\u201d Even so, the Delta culture appears to have permeated its partner. One analyst said: \u201cThey are aggressively managing the business for profitability rather than grand developments... It\u2019s not dots on the map, it\u2019s not sexy and it\u2019s not glamorous.\u201d Virgin\u2019s retrenchment has seen it not just grounding its domestic flights but pulling back from destinations such as Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town, under stiff competition from Gulf carriers. Ambitious deals such as an option for six A380s to match BA are back on ice, although the efficient Boeing Dreamliners can not come soon enough to cut its fuel bills. The 28 October inaugural flight for Virgin\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner \u2013 the first of 17 on order \u2013 will be to Delta\u2019s Atlanta hub. But with a typical Bransonian flourish, the flight will be all about the journey rather than the destination: UK electronic soul band Rudimental will play what Virgin Atlantic promises will the first ever gig to be streamed live from over the Atlantic. Branson may be pleased that Walsh feels there is sufficient rivalry to keep up the invective. But one industry observer suggests that hostility is waning, pointing to a world where few airlines can survive alone, and the deep pockets of Gulf players such as Emirates and Etihad are displacing the big beasts of old: \u201cThey are busy trying to make money, rather than beat the crap out of each other.\u201d And with conventional aviation losing its sense of adventure, Branson\u2019s space programme has become a bigger obsession. His eyes are on the stars, and his mind more on Galactic than Atlantic. AERIAL ASSAULTS 2008 Branson on Walsh\u2019s accusation that the entrepreneur had lied when claiming he had condemned price-fixing on the BBC\u2019s Money Programme: \u201cIt is no wonder that BA is in the state it is in if Willie Walsh has the time to watch past editions of the Money Programme.\u201d 2012 Walsh on Branson\u2019s offer of a \u00a31m bet over the success of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s Delta deal: \u201cIs Branson going to be the 51% owner of Virgin Atlantic in five years from now? If he wants to bet that, I think it would be an acceptable bet. But he\u2019s a billionaire banker - allegedly - and I don\u2019t think a million pounds would hurt him. A knee in the groin would be acceptable.\u201d Branson replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve got used to BA hitting below the belt over the years, but I\u2019m confident it would be the other way around on this occasion.\u201d 2014 Walsh on the ice-bucket challenge: \u201cI nominate the man who effectively owns and controls the Virgin transatlantic business. That\u2019s right, Richard, this is for you - Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe Delta management team are much more rational\u2026 Virgin has almost disappeared... Delta control Virgin\u2026 We just call it Delta now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
