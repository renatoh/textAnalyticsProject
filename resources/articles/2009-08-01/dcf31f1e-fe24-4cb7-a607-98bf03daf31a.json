The BBC has come in for heavy criticism from within the racing industry after its decision to cut back sharply on its coverage of the sport from 2010, and the 13 days it will cover next year does not so far include Saturday's unique jockeys' team racing event. When the new three-year terrestrial television deal between BBC, Channel 4 and racing was signed last week it was announced that, in future, discussions on the coverage of the Shergar Cup would take place on an annual basis. Last night a spokeswoman for the BBC would only say that \"we never comment on ongoing negotiations\". However, Ascot's director of communications Nick Smith said: \"We have had very positive discussions on securing Shergar Cup coverage on the BBC. They have identified their key days such as the Derby and Royal Ascot, but they have always been keen to cover the Shergar Cup in the past. \"The BBC have done an awful lot to make it appealing to those who don't always watch racing. It is unashamedly pitched as a light entertainment show and, later in the year, we will sit down and have a look at every aspect of the day.\" Smith revealed that the team aspect of the event is under close scrutiny and in addition to the idea of an all-female jockeys' team, Ascot are also investigating the possibility of two teams of champion jockeys \u2013 one domestic and one international. \"We are very keen to keep up the international aspect of the event \u2013 that makes it credible with the racing aficionados,\" he said. \"We are also considering having a jockeys' team made up of apprentices.\" Smith added that the event would continue to evolve: \"It has moved on and developed,\" he said. \"It has gone from an owners' competition to one between jockeys and from two teams to four teams. The Shergar Cup is one of those events that will quickly go stale unless it is developed and rebranded.\" Frankie Dettori will not be at Ascot on Saturday due to riding commitments for Godolphin and yesterday a spokeswoman for the stable confirmed that he will ride Campanologist in the Rose of Lancaster Stakes at Haydock. Godolphin's exciting purchase Long Lashes, who was bought after a comfortable win for Jessica Harrington at The Curragh, will run in the Sweet Solera Stakes at Newmarket on the same day when Ted Durcan will be in the saddle. Godolphin's good run of form continued with a striking six-length debut success for Atlantis Star under Durcan at Pontefract yesterday. \"He won very well,\" said the winning rider. \"You couldn't have asked for any more from a horse making his debut and he felt like a nice horse in the making.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
