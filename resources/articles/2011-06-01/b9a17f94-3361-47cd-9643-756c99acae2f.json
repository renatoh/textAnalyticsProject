The guitarist in punk rock group Panic, Ginn also operated his own radio parts company, Solid State Transmitters, out of his parents' house in Californian suburb Hermosa Beach. In January 1978, Panic had recorded their debut EP, Nervous Breakdown (a session financed by revenues from Ginn's company), with LA indie label Bomp! offering to release it. But when money troubles at Bomp! delayed the release by 18 months \u2013 during which time Panic renamed themselves Black Flag \u2013 Ginn paid $2,000 to have a thousand copies of the EP pressed up on his own new label, SST Records. SST would release all Black Flag's records until their split in 1986, but it was no mere vanity label. Key albums by luminaries of the 1980s American hardcore and underground rock scenes were released on SST, including the Minutemen, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr. Some bands grumbled about the label's non-existent accounting \u2013 they would sell tens of thousands of records and barely see a dollar \u2013 and quit SST, but its importance to the US alternative rock scene is unquestioned. Indeed, the label's impressive catalogue is held in such esteem that transistor gear produced by Ginn's Solid State Transmitters in the 1970s \u2013 stamped with the same logo found on every SST album \u2013 is now fiercely sought after by collectors on eBay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
