Faletau suffered the injury during Bath\u2019s defeat by Exeter on Friday and, despite briefly playing on, he was taken the hospital that night. In what comes as a considerable blow for Wales a subsequent scan has revealed he needs to have a plate inserted. Wales begin their autumn campaign against Scotland on 3 November followed by matches in successive weeks against Australia, Tonga and then South Africa. Blackadder could not give an exact timeframe but acknowledged Faletau\u2019s layoff would be \u201canything from four weeks or above\u201d meaning he is up against it to feature at all when factoring in rehabilitation time. Faletau\u2019s close friend Billy Vunipola has suffered two similar injuries recently and was sidelined for around three months on both occasions. It also means Bath will be without Faletau for their European double header which begins against Toulouse on Saturday, with Zach Mercer standing by to deputise at No 8. If there is any silver lining for Bath it is that they will be spared the headache over Faletau\u2019s release for the Scotland fixture, which falls outside the World Rugby international window. Last year Bath were fined \u00a360,000 by Premiership Rugby for allowing Faletau to play for Wales against South Africa, which also took place outside the allotted window. \u201c[Taulupe] has got a broken arm, he\u2019s got a radial break. He\u2019s going to have a plate put in so it\u2019s anything from four weeks or above,\u201d said Blackadder. \u201c[He\u2019s] a British Lion, he steps up, he\u2019s a big-game player. It\u2019s just one of those unfortunate things but it\u2019s a good opportunity for Zach Mercer, who has been playing well all season.\u201d Meanwhile the Champions Cup organisers have confirmed that there will be a clampdown on high tackles in this season\u2019s competition. The EPCR chairman, Simon Halliday, revealed that the EPCR\u2019s referees chief, Jo\u00ebl Jutge, has gone to the extent of speaking to broadcasters, including BT Sport, in an effort to steer pundits and commentators away from stoking the debate that has raged in England after Will Spencer\u2019s red card for Leicester last month. \u201cWe are doing our best to make this right. We can\u2019t afford to take it lightly, because the legal world is coming,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cWhether you like it or not, it is coming. It\u2019s happened in the US. There are certain things people are telling me are no longer allowed in NFL, which we do over here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
