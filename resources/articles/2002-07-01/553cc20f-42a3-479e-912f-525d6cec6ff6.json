Each flashing light marks a share price collapsing. Traders stare forlornly at their computers. 'It is freefall,' said one. The market has been open for barely two minutes and the FTSE-100 - an index of the 100 most valued British companies - has plummeted 88 points. It is another bad day in the stock market. In fact, it is a bad end to a grim week: a week that has prompted genuine fears of a coming global economic crisis. Friday's share collapse killed off a three-day rally that had tried to halt some of the steepest falls in British share prices since the 1987 crash. Suddenly 2002 is starting to feel a lot like 1929. But this time the effects could be even more devastating. The fact is that share prices now affect everyone: it won't just be stockbrokers flinging themselves out of windows. The share price boom of the Eighties and Nineties - the longest bull market in history - has drawn the whole world into investing in markets. From pension funds to councils, to the Church of England, to private investors looking to get lucky, a share crash now affects every one of us. Pensions can be destroyed, savings wiped out and towns bankrupted. Yet many ordinary people know little about the inner workings of the City and the people who are at its hub. On Friday, The Observer spent a day recording the life of one trading day in this financial world. We all need to know more. The decisions being taken now by the professional market players have assumed ever more importance. Our fate could be in their hands. John Fletcher, known as 'Fletch', is one such decision-maker. The 35-year-old works as a trader in the City of London for Durlacher Ltd, a senior British investment bank whose origins stretch back to the 1930s. Each morning, as the rest of London sleeps, Fletcher zooms in from the Essex hinterland on a powerful Suzuki motorbike. It is easier to dodge the traffic that way and he soon arrives at Durlacher's smart, modern office block at the centre of Europe's financial heart. He is at his desk - still topped by an English World Cup flag - by 7am at the latest. As Fletcher switches from biker leathers to a suit and tie, the latest overnight market news has appeared on his trading screen. Stock markets, like a herd of animals, follow each other. It is vital to know how the last market performed before the next one opens. Only by predicting share price movements can Fletcher advise clients on when and what to buy and sell. No one wants to get caught by surprise. For Fletcher that means checking if New York shares closed up or down and if the Far East stock exchanges continued the American pattern. Finally there is the Cantor Index: a spread-betting firm that issues odds on share performances. On Friday, all the early news is bad. New York has closed sharply down. That sends jitters through traders in Asia. A wave of selling sentiment is heading towards London, driving prices down around the world. Finally, Cantor is predicting the market to open 80 points off. Before one share is sold, Fletcher - and every other trader in the City - knows Friday is going to be tough. Just how tough quickly becomes obvious. As the markets open, banks of phones throughout the Durlacher trading floor ring into life. Each trader - equipped with four computer terminals displaying price information - starts taking orders, talking urgently into mouthpieces, occasionally rising to pace the floor. The callers are private clients, asking for advice or seeking to adjust their portfolios. The dramatic fall continues. By 8.30 the FTSE-100 is down 110 points. Some callers want out, but others want in. Even in a falling market there is money to be made. Fletcher specialises in 'derivatives', also known as options. Share trading has now moved far beyond simple buy and sell orders on individual shares. Much trading these days centres on buying at possible future prices: that is where options come in. They are essentially a bet on the direction of a share price over time. If the investor gets the direction right - whether up or down - there can be a tidy profit to be had either way. Fletcher quickly demonstrates how. One caller rings in to cash in a derivatives investment. The caller had guessed the correct direction of the market (down) and urged Fletcher to sell. 'Don't worry, you are already deeply in the money,' he says. He waits a few minutes and the share prices continue to fall. That means extra profit. The sale is put through. The investor chalks up tens of thousands of pounds in profit. Others do not have such success. Later in the morning another client calls in. His options are still 'in the money' - but only just. As the market fall bottoms out and starts to steady, Fletcher tells the client to sell and cash in. The client wants to think about it. Perhaps waiting would increase potential profits if the market recovers. It would be an error. For traders, seeing the future is the key. All share investment is essentially a form of gambling and stock exchanges are the biggest casinos in the world. For Fletcher the key to unlocking the future is called 'technical analysis' - simply a study of trend lines. This sees a company purely as a share price line on a graph: analysing that graph's past trends will predict the future price. No attention is paid to what the company makes or whether it makes a profit or loss. It could be drugs, or it could be aeroplanes. It does not matter. If the trend predictions say the price will go up: buy. If down: sell. It is pure capitalism, as far removed from the workers and customers of a company as it is possible to imagine. For the technical trader, only the price trend matters. Other traders take the opposite view. They look at the 'fundamentals' of a firm: such as profits, product and market share. But Fletcher is satisfied with his bare line graphs. After all, they told him this crash was on its way two weeks ago. 'I saw this coming and I have been telling my clients to cover themselves. As a result they are much better off than most in this market,' he says. Fletcher's trend lines predict market sentiment. When they rise they are displaying desire for the stock but, if they peak, they show the market has become afraid it has overbought. 'It is simply showing where fear and greed is.' Fletcher has had long enough to perfect his techniques. He has been in the City since 1987 and has been through previous stock market crashes and an IRA bomb. He has been at Durlacher for 10 years - in City terms a lifetime. Like so many of his colleagues he was brought up in Essex and still lives there with a wife and two children in Leigh-on-Sea. His manner is polite and jokey. Favoured traders are termed 'old boy'. As the morning progresses the FTSE-100 steadies to hit 4,159 at noon, down 138 points. It is a bad day, but Fletcher soothes clients and dissuades them from trying to make any panicky sales. It is time for lunch: an opportunity to leave the screens behind and grab a beer and a meal at a packed City watering hole. While eating, Fletcher plans his strategy for the afternoon ahead - and how to calm increasingly worried clients. However, Fletcher by himself - or even the whole of Durlacher - cannot alter the sentiment of a market. But thousands of men like Fletcher, and they are almost all men, can. All their individual actions can add up to an unstoppable whole. While one sell order will disappear unnoticed into a market, 10,000 sell orders will see that market collapse. That collapse begins just after lunch. It is caused by the release of US trade figures at 1.30pm that hint at worsening conditions in the American economy. Immediately the gold price jumps $8 an ounce. Why? Gold is safer than shares. The share markets are becoming too dangerous. 'If you think the US economy is going to collapse, then you use gold as a safe haven,' says another Durlacher trader Graeme Hatch. These are not encouraging words. Even though New York shares have not opened, London traders know what will happen when they do. In London the sell-off begins and by 1.47pm the FTSE-100 heads down 184 points. Sitting opposite Fletcher, Hatch cradles his phone and watches a sea of red sweep over the screens. 'Down, down, down,' he mutters. Then comes another hammer blow. American drugs giant Johnson &amp; Johnson announces a criminal investigation into accounting irregularities at a factory in Puerto Rico. For the market, that is enough of a reminder of recent accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom to trigger new falls. When New York shares open they quickly fall by more than 230 points. London shares head down too. The client who earlier had declined to sell now finds he is 'out of the money'. The key to understanding why an accounting scandal in Puerto Rico should affect British shares lies in the interconnected nature of world markets and trade. Anything that has an impact upon the American economy - by far the most powerful in the world - ripples out into all the other economies across the globe. The news is also instantly transmitted to every trading screen in the world. Each trader at Durlacher has access to several real-time news wires, can monitor data and prices in every country and has television channels on his computer carrying live interviews with company chiefs. In terms of share trading, the world has never been a smaller - or faster - place. London shares stagger, wounded, through the rest of the day, falling sharply again just before the close of trading at 4.30pm. The FTSE-100 ends down 199 points at 4,098 - a stunning 3.1 per cent drop. It has now lost more than 20.5 per cent of its value since 17 May. By anyone's standards, that is a spectacular collapse. And it is a blow felt by every pension, savings scheme and investment in Britain. But it seems almost certain there is worse to come. Fletcher has been analysing his trend line graphs. He is predicting a share collapse on the FTSE-100 all the way through to 3,800. It could even happen this week. There will be more bad days to come. That much seems certain. As Fletcher gets back on his motorbike and heads to Essex, he sums up another Bloody Friday. 'I have stayed until the bitter end today. To look at the screens it was certainly pretty bitter.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
