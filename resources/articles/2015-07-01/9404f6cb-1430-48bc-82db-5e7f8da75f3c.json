The trio took the stage alongside showrunner Steven Moffat and teased Doctor Who fans with new footage from the upcoming season nine. The trailer, after a images of new aliens, new planets, and the Doctor playing the guitar, ends with a shot of Game of Thrones actor Maisie Williams as one of the show\u2019s new human (well, human-looking) characters. Capaldi defended the choice to reimagine Gomez\u2019s character (usually called The Master) as a female version called The Mistress. It has been a source of some controversy among fans of the long-running show, but Capaldi said that shouldn\u2019t be the case. \u201cA lot has been made of the agenda change, but I really think people should applaud Michelle for taking this role and filling it so completely,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion on having a female Doctor?\u201d a woman dressed as the Matt Smith Doctor asked Moffat. \u201cI think I\u2019ve expressed myself about as clearly as I could in the context of the show\u201d he said, indicating Gomez. \u201cI will not be revealing myself as a man today,\u201d Gomez added. Capaldi suggested a drag episode. It was Capaldi\u2019s first time at San Diego Comic-Con, and he put his theatre training to use straight away. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in front of 7,000 people before in my life. I can\u2019t hear them all, though, properly,\u201d he said. The crowd responded accordingly. \u201cAll those years in pantomime,\u201d he said. Practically no one moved an inch when the hall opened: most of the audience had been waiting outside for hours at least \u2013 days, in some cases \u2013 and simply packed a lunch and stayed all day to see Thursday\u2019s lineup of panels. One man snoozed through the whole event. What\u2019s the Doctor like, moderator Chris Hardwick asked Capaldi. Is he a nice guy? \u201cHe\u2019s a laugh, he\u2019s great-looking, he\u2019s terrifically lithe for his age,\u201d Capaldi responded. \u201cWe live in a world where everyeone\u2019s so easy and everything\u2019s so accessible, and the Doctor\u2019s mysterious! He\u2019s a Time Lord, not a \u2018guy\u2019. But if he was a guy, he\u2019d have my face and he\u2019d be really nice.\u201d One of the fans took the microphone with a Muppet-style puppet, which she held up to the microphone. \u201cHello!\u201d said Hardwick. \u201cAnd what is your name?\u201d \u201cPuppet Laura,\u201d responded the questioner. \u201cThat\u2019s a very convincing human you\u2019ve got with you,\u201d Moffat said, who answered the deep-trivia question with a reference to the pre-hiatus version of the series, to scattered applause from the back of the room. \u201cAh, the sound of elderly fans clapping,\u201d Moffat said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit slower.\u201d \u201cWhy do you think he\u2019s so enamoured of humans?\u201d Hardwick asked Capaldi of The Doctor. \u201cBudgetary reasons,\u201d Capaldi replied. This article was amended on 10 July; Peter Capaldi did not call Michelle Gomez \u201cMelissa\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
