The Royal College of Physicians concedes there are \"many shortcomings\" in the provision of palliative care in this country. The editor of the Lancet, Dr Richard Horton, admits that medical students are rarely taught the skills of end-of-life care. In an article for our website yesterday, Dr Horton described graphically how doctors currently bring lives to an end: \"More painkiller will be given and sedation will turn into coma. As coma progresses, so infection in the lungs often takes hold and breathing will become laboured. More distress means more painkiller. This cycle escalates until death.\" Anyone who has seen a relative die in this fashion - often a lingering death involving dehydration, real pain and very little dignity - may wonder why so many doctors believe that presiding over such an ending is so much more ethical than actively carrying out a patient's wish to die speedily at the time of his or her choosing. The Royal College has recently reversed its previously neutral position on the issue. Dr Horton is also opposed to any measures which would change the present \"double effect\" regime whereby death may be a supposedly incidental result of treatment. The House of Lords today has the opportunity to take a humane step forward by voting for Lord Joffe's assisted dying bill. Instead of doctors semi-covertly ending lives in the manner described by Dr Horton, they would be allowed to help people in a transparent manner. Their patients would have to be terminally ill, of sound mind and facing unbearable suffering. There are numerous safeguards, including written consent, second opinions, alternative advice, witnesses, cooling-off periods and so on. There are appropriate clauses allowing for conscientious objection by any medical practitioner. No hospital or hospice would be obliged to offer such assistance. It is, in other words, a limited and relatively modest proposal which would help not a few people. No one denies it is also a radical break with the past and that this is an issue which troubles many health professionals and people of faith. But the rational choice of a dying person should be paramount. The terminally ill should not receive lectures about the sanctity of life and they also have the right not to be deceived about the often dubious efficacy of their treatment, or its so-called double effect. Lord Joffe's bill deserves to succeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
