Not that Christophers is an ascetic. Far from it. His Messiah always bristles with dancing energy, as well as unfolding organically from one number into the next. There were plenty of expressive and even romantic gestures in this account, too, typified by some rather soupy phrasing in the overture and by a very striking broadening of the first syllable of the \"Wonderful\" outburst in For Unto Us a Child Is Born. And Christophers always has a trump card in the shape of his outstanding chorus \u2013 18 of them rather than 16 \u2013 whose warm sound and technical security provided the rock upon which Messiah rests. For all the conductor's cajolings, this Messiah took time to settle. The first part of Handel's oratorio had many fine moments, among which James Gilchrist's compellingly deliberate Comfort Ye and a scintillating Rejoice Greatly from the substitute soprano Sophie Bevan stood out. But it was not until part two, the core of the work depicting Christ's Passion and Resurrection, that the reading consistently transcended its individual numbers. Catherine Wyn-Rogers set the standard for the rest to follow with a grippingly impassioned He Was Despised, and was matched by Gilchrist's hugely engaged accounts of Christ's torments, before the corner was turned and the chorus's pivotal Lift Up Your Hearts carried things irresistibly through to the Hallelujah Chorus. Part three did not quite succeed in maintaining this tremendously high level throughout. But Christopher Purves grabbed his moment with an irresistibly stentorian The Trumpet Shall Sound, and Handel's supreme final pages, from Worthy Is the Lamb to the Amen, were wonderfully done, bringing a tingle to the spine and a tear to the eye, as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
