Palace are a point from the foot of the Premier League and will seek to rest first-team players against Bolton Wanderers in their FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday before Saturday\u2019s game with Everton. The club are still hopeful of securing the Arsenal full-back Carl Jenkinson for around \u00a37m this week, though agreement has yet to be struck over personal terms. The 24-year-old, who boasts a solitary England cap, earns around \u00a340,000 a week at the Emirates Stadium and would expect an increase in wage across the capital. While that deal should eventually be completed, there is renewed hope, too, that the experienced Juventus left-back Patrice Evra can still be secured after the player apparently relaxed his initial demand for a contract through to 2019. Palace would be more comfortable offering the former Manchester United player, now 35, an 18-month deal, though their pursuit of defensive recruits is a reflection of recent dismal form. There has been one win in 16 matches in all competitions, and none in Allardyce\u2019s five games to date since he replaced Alan Pardew just before Christmas. The former England manager has been surprised to discover the extent of self-doubt that has infected an \u201cunder-achieving\u201d Palace squad, epitomised by the late capitulation at West Ham on Saturday, with the task of retaining Premier League status suddenly daunting. \u201cIt always scares you when you first come in, and I am scared that we won\u2019t succeed, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely, because the last thing I want is to come here and not be able to save Crystal Palace with a track record which has never had that blemish [of relegation] on it since I\u2019ve been in the Premier League. \u201cWhen you go to any new club the fear is as great as when you first start out, when you get your first manager\u2019s job, sit behind the desk and think: \u2018Making this team work or making this team successful is my responsibility now.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m not fearful of losing my job. It\u2019s the fear of not wanting to blemish my record, and [that desire to] help Palace get out of trouble when it\u2019s stayed in the Premier League so long recently. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, we are in crisis mode. We\u2019ve got 16 points from 21 games and we won\u2019t feel comfortable until we\u2019ve got the same number of points as games played. It\u2019s a hard task to take on, but I\u2019m willing to use all the experience I\u2019ve gained to say to the players: \u2018Look, I\u2019ve been here before. This is what we need to do. If you listen to it and you put it in place as quickly as you possibly can, it will help you.\u2019 I am saying it will give them a better chance.\u201d Palace secured Jeffrey Schlupp from Leicester last week for an initial \u00a39m but continue to be hampered by injury problems \u2013 neither Scott Dann nor James McArthur will be risked against Bolton \u2013 while Wilfried Zaha and Bakary Sako compete at the Africa Cup of Nations. Allardyce has pointed to the upturn he instigated at Sunderland last season through the mid-season purchase of Lamine Kon\u00e9, Wahbi Khazri and Jan Kirchhoff as evidence of what can be achieved in the January window. He still aspires to add a central midfielder and, potentially, a centre-half to the ranks as well as those full-backs. \u201cI still need better players to come in and help change the mentality and lift it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done that with the players I\u2019ve brought in at Blackburn and at Sunderland, and I\u2019d like to do it here. The chairman [Steve Parish] would like to do it, but there is only a certain amount of money, there\u2019s only limited resources. We have to utilise that money the best possibly we can. It is a risk we have to take.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
