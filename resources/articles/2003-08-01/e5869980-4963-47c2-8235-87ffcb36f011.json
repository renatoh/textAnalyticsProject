Tony Blair's official spokesman Tom Kelly was forced to apologise unreservedly for comments referring to the late David Kelly as a Walter Mitty-type character. The biological weapons expert, who apparently committed suicide after being identified as the \"single source\" of the BBC's controversial \"sexed-up\" Iraq dossier story, may have shared Mitty's timid nature but his widow and family were incensed at the implication that he was a fantasist who exaggerated his own importance. Used as a noun, the phrase Walter Mitty is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"referring to a person who fantasises about a life much more exciting and glamorous than their own\". The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, written by James Thurber and first published in 1941, is a book that has entered since entered the cultural lexicon. In the short story Mitty is an affably timid middle aged accountant, dominated by his wife, who creates a fantasy world in which he is at the centre of all manner of exciting occupations. Mitty, who leads a mundane existence, spends much of the book daydreaming about his inner life as an intrepid pilot, a brilliant surgeon and a brave soldier. From the opening pages of the book the contrast is clear - Mitty appears in his daydreams as a naval commander firing off orders to his men, juxtaposed with the \"real\" Walter, who his heard timidly taking orders from his wife. Throughout the book Thurber weaves Mitty's actual and imaginary worlds into one, implying the only way that the character can survive his mundane existence is by living his life through his daydreams, which represent his inner spirit and the course he is too scared to follow in real life. In the following extract, Thurber describes Mitty's drive to work, all the while imaging that he is a brilliant surgeon: \"'Quiet, man!' said Mitty, in a low cool voice. He sprang to the machine, which was now going pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-queep. He began fingering delicately with a row of glistening dials. 'Give me a fountain pen!' he snapped. \"Someone handed him a fountain pen. He pulled a faulty piston out of the machine and inserted the pen in its place. 'That will hold for 10 minutes,' he said. 'Get on with the operation. . . ' - 'Back it up, Mac! Look out for that Buick!' Walter Mitty jammed on the brakes. 'Wrong lane, Mac,' said the parking-lot attendant, looking at Mitty closely.\" In 1947, the book was made into a musical film for MGM by Norman McLeod, extending Mitty's imaginary adventures over two days and starring Danny Kaye as the central character. The film, which abandons Thurber's psychological study to play it purely for laughs, takes the central conceit of the book and turns it into reality. \"His dream becomes true when he accidentally meets a mysterious woman who hands him a little black book. According to her it contains the locations of the Dutch crown jewels hidden since World War II. Soon Mitty finds himself in the middle of a confusing conspiracy and has to admit that being a hero in real life isn't that easy,\" reads the film's entry on the online Internet Movie Database. Appropriately enough, given the central character's recent return to the front pages, the film is being remade with elastic faced comic Jim Carrey in the title role and is due for release next year. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
