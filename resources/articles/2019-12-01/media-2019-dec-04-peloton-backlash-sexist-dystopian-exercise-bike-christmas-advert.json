The advert, which has been viewed almost 2m times on YouTube, shows a woman receiving an exercise bike from her partner on Christmas morning. The gift inspires her to record a video diary of her exercise sessions, in which she proudly says: \u201cA year ago I didn\u2019t realise how much this would change me.\u201d The 30-second advert \u2013 titled \u201cThe gift that gives back\u201d \u2013 was first released in mid-November, but this week a storm of criticism gathered pace online, and even inspired a series of spoof video remakes. Critics called it \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d, pointing out that the woman was already slim at the start and the implication that her partner thinks she needs to get fitter and lose weight was patronising and damaging. The backlash against the business \u2013 which sells \u00a32,000 bikes equipped with screens for virtual spin classes and has an army of celebrity fans including David Beckham and Hugh Jackman \u2013 has reached such a pitch that $1.5bn has been wiped off its value, which had reached $9.39bn before the advert. On Tuesday its shares fell 9%, and by lunchtime on Wednesday the shares were down another 6%. Ash Bendelow, the managing director of the UK creative agency Brave, described the advert as \u201ccringe, old-fashioned and tone deaf\u201d. He added: \u201cIt reminds us of the \u2018seven tips for keeping your man\u2019 notions from the 1950s, rather than where society is today in 2019.\u201d The advert has even been compared to Charlie Brooker\u2019s dystopian television series Black Mirror, not least because the woman\u2019s grateful thank you to her partner at the end is delivered when she shows him the vlog clips, on what appears to be Christmas the following year. Others suggested that at times it resembles a hostage video. On YouTube the video is still gaining thousands of views every hour, but was attracting five \u201cthumbs down\u201d ratings for each \u201cthumbs up\u201d. Peloton turned off comments on the YouTube post. Other social media responses have been more graphic. Peloton, which also sells treadmills, aims to become the \u201cNetflix of fitness\u201d. \u201cOn the most basic level, Peloton sells happiness,\u201d the company said this year. It styles itself not as a mere provider of exercise bikes but as a company that has \u201cthe opportunity to create one of the most innovative global technology platforms of our time\u201d. Its flagship product is a \u00a32,000 stationary bike with touchscreen. Users can stream or download fitness classes for a monthly fee \u2013 \u00a339 a month in the UK \u2013 which allows them to interact with instructors or other members, without having to leave home. They can even digitally \u201chigh five\u201d other riders. The New York-based company was founded in 2012 by John Foley, a former executive at the book chain Barnes &amp; Noble. When the company floated on the US stock market in September it was valued at $8bn, even though it was loss-making. It launched in the UK last year and has since opened nine showrooms where potential customers can try out the equipment. Peloton had sold 577,000 of its hi-tech bikes and treadmills by the end of June this year, but believes it can go on to sell 14m in the US, UK, Germany and Canada. In the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) introduced new rules in January under which adverts \u201cmust not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence\u201d. In August Philadelphia cream cheese and Volkswagen became the first brands to have adverts banned under the guidance after complaints from the public that they perpetuated harmful stereotypes. The campaign for Philadelphia featured new fathers acting ineptly while looking after their children, while the VW advert for its electric e-Golf vehicle showed a woman sitting on a bench next to a pram. While the Peloton advert has prompted outrage on social media, Geraint Lloyd-Taylor, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin, said it did not breach the ASA rules. However, he added: \u201cThe ad doesn\u2019t seem to advance the cause of gender equality.\u201d In a statement to CNBC, Peloton said it was disappointed by how some people had misinterpreted the advert, but was \u201cencouraged by \u2013 and grateful for \u2013 the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received from those who understand what we were trying to communicate\u201d. It added: \u201cWe constantly hear from our members how their lives have been meaningfully and positively impacted after purchasing or being gifted a Peloton bike or Tread \u2026 Our holiday spot was created to celebrate that fitness and wellness journey.\u201d Bendelow said the reaction seemed excessive, and it may still boost sales: \u201cThe outrage is perhaps a little disproportionate and only time will tell whether there will be many Pelotons underneath the Christmas tree.\u201d The ASA told the Guardian it had so far received just one official objection to the advert. But the complainant did not take issue with the advert\u2019s apparently sexist tone: their problem was that the woman featured appeared to be cycling faster than humanly possible. \u2022 This article was updated on 6 December 2019 to include the figure for Peloton\u2019s stock-market value just before the advert, $9.39bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
