This was a return to his roots for Mr Dobson. I remember working with him and the outfit he used to head, NHS Unlimited, more than a decade ago to fight health service privatisation and the Conservative proposals for opted-out NHS trusts. One of our other allies in the long march against opting-out and the internal market at that time was an up and coming Labour politician from the north-east, Alan Milburn. So while Mr Dobson has been going back to basics in defence of the principles of a national health service, his successor has been going back to the future, airbrushing his past out of the script and leading the charge for foundation hospitals - which are nothing less than opting-out with knobs on. Just take a quick glance at what it is that he's proposing. The foundation hospitals will be wholly self-standing commercial enterprises able to flog off buildings and land and keep the cash raised, take over and asset strip \"failing\" NHS hospitals, and set rates of pay outside of national agreements. Although the government appears to have assured the unions that private companies will not be running foundation hospitals for profit it's a phony pledge that takes us all for a bunch of mugs. What if the foundation hospital also happens to be a private finance initiative hospital? Once the last lines of accountability back to the government and national agreements are severed how do you stop it from becoming a wholly commercial enterprise from top to bottom? You cannot. Foundation hospitals are the pinnacle of New Labour's \"winners and losers\" approach to healthcare. This elitist bunch will get the lions share of everything - money, staff and political clout - and if your local hospital cannot fight its way out of the league table relegation zone you would probably be better off queuing up for surgery at the meat counter at your local supermarket. For the senior managers in the foundation hospitals, and the armies of accountants and management consultants who home in on any new health policy like thirsty leeches, happy days are here again and its trebles all round. But anyone looking to delve into the murky world of chicanery, jobs for the boys and girls and fat cat salaries that on past form will be de rigeur in Mr Milburn's brave new hospital world can expect to be stonewalled by the cries of \"commercial confidentiality\". The foundation hospitals will be able to soak up precious staffing resources because they will have the cash to pay a bit more. Surrounding hospitals will be destabilised in the process as workers jump on the jobs merry-go-round, leaving them ripe for takeover by the foundation empire builders. I never thought it would come to this under a Labour government and, clearly, nor did Mr Dobson. The real radical alternative of building up capacity and standards across the whole of the NHS, including the forgotten world of mental healthcare, has been ditched in favour of a policy that could have been lifted straight out of a 1980s Adam Smith Institute discussion paper. \u00b7 Geoff Martin is the London convenor for Unison.
