Inside the meeting in the Detroit suburb of Rochester, the mood was tense as the vulnerable Democrat, battling for survival in a district that leans towards supporting the president, tackled the issue of her freshly announced support for impeaching Trump. \u201cDo you really want to blow up the world just to get rid of Donald Trump? Do you?\u201d a Trump supporter yelled at attendees. Outside the meeting room, dozens of pro-Trump protesters held up signs that read: \u201cImpeach Slotkin, Keep Trump.\u201d As Slotkin took the stage in front of about 400 people, Trump supporters repeatedly yelled over the freshman lawmaker as she spoke, while those backing Slotkin loudly cheered her. Just hours earlier, Slotkin had announced via an op-ed in the Detroit Free Press that she would support two articles of impeachment over abuse of power and obstructing justice. She\u2019s one of a handful of vulnerable moderate Democrats who had headed into last weekend still undecided on the impeachment vote, which is expected to happen on Wednesday. Like most others in that group, she flipped a seat in 2018 in what is traditionally Republican territory. Trump supporters at the town hall sought to drive home that point. \u201cI\u2019m a voter, I\u2019m from her district and she needs to hear us,\u201d said Trump supporter Ron Stevers. He said Republicans are fired up to back the president, who is visiting Michigan on Wednesday night. At the meeting, Slotkin acknowledged the political risk in her decision, but asked for Trump supporters to hear her out. \u201cI know it\u2019s controversial, but while we may not agree, I hope you believe me when I say that I made this decision out of duty to the country \u2026 because this is bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Slotkin in 2018 defeated incumbent Republican Mike Bishop in Michigan\u2019s 8th congressional district by a 51-47 margin to take a seat that the GOP had held since 2000. Two years earlier, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the district \u2013 which largely covers a middle- and upper-middle-class region that stretches from Lansing to Detroit\u2019s north-western suburbs \u2013 by a 50.6-43.9 margin. Slotkin, a former CIA officer, is also one of a group of seven representatives with a military background who propelled the impeachment effort in September when they collectively came out in support of an inquiry. Some of those, including the Michigan congresswoman Haley Stevens, who represents a neighboring and similar district, haven\u2019t yet announced their position. After taking the stage to a split of loud cheers and boos, Slotkin laid out how she arrived at the decision to back impeachment. She noted she initially held out on her decision to support opening an investigation because she wanted to let Americans decide Trump\u2019s fate in the 2020 election. But that changed, Slotkin said, when Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, \u201cvery specifically\u201d admitted that they had asked a foreign power for help in investigating Joe Biden. \u201cAs a CIA officer who has taken an oath to protect and defend the constitution, reaching out to a foreign power is something that is [an impeachable offense],\u201d she said. Slotkin noted that she served in the CIA under former Presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush, and said that they would \u201cregularly wield their power\u201d to achieve the nation\u2019s national security goals. However, she added, Trump \u201cdecided to do this for his own political gain and not the national security of the United States\u201d. Slotkin added she also supported impeaching Trump on obstruction of justice because the constitution gives the House power to investigate presidents, and Trump ordered officials not to cooperate. \u201cWhat if that becomes normal?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat if next time we have a Democratic president asking China to carry out a cyber-attack? For me this is something that I cannot abide, that I cannot accept.\u201d After the meeting, Trump supporter Larry Parsons, who lives in nearby Hartland in Slotkin\u2019s district, said he still wasn\u2019t convinced by her impeachment case, and dismissed her arguments around obstruction of justice and abuse of power as \u201csilly claims\u201d. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask a foreign power to investigate an opponent \u2013 that\u2019s a false premise,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cHe asked a foreign power to investigate corruption.\u201d Two different conservative organizations that are active statewide put together the protests. It\u2019s unclear how many of those supporters live in Slotkin\u2019s district, or if they would even vote for her 2020 if she opposed impeachment. Slotkin told the media after the event that she understood that her position would anger Republicans, but added that part of the \u201cresponsibility of leadership\u201d is making \u201cthe tough call, even when it\u2019s not popular\u201d. \u201cMy hope is that people want elected representatives with integrity. My hope is that people say, \u201cHuh, I don\u2019t agree with everything that she\u2019s done, but she makes calls based on what she believes is right,\u201d Slotkin said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
