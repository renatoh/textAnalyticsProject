The Cayman Islands are a byword for Caribbean luxury, and one of the City of London's favourite tax havens. Yet the British territory, only 20 miles long, is currently embroiled in a scandal that could have come straight from the pages of a comic novel. All the island's judges have, at some point, been arrested, suspended, or mired in controversy. The police chief has been sacked, and one of Scotland Yard's most senior officers \u2013 John Yates \u2013 has flown out to try to sort out the mess. He couldn't. Britain controls the Caymans, via governor Stuart Jack, and subsidises the island's budget by licensing thousands of offshore companies, many involving tax avoidance schemes. But the stability of the territory is now under question, thanks largely to personality clashes between the people trusted with running its legal system. The Cayman Islands have three judges in a court structure that mimics that of the UK. But in recent months, all three have turned on each other in bitter quarrels. One judge was arrested and had his house searched, another attempted to have critics prosecuted, and the third has been suspended, accused of spreading lurid gossip about the other two. British legal and police figures have flown out to try to stabilise the situation. But critics on the island say they may have made matters worse. A corruption inquiry by a Metropolitan police team overseen by \"Yates of the Yard\" ended with one of the judges awarded more than $1m for false arrest. The police chief, Stuart Kernohan, an expatriate from Merseyside, was sacked following allegations about his role in a break-in at a local newspaper office. Dismissed when he refused a governor's order to return to the islands, he was later exonerated and is now suing for wrongful dismissal and false imprisonment. A public tribunal last month, held at the beachside Marriott hotel, was convened to investigate one of the judges involved, Priya Levers, who was accused by a colleague, the Jamaican-born chief justice, Anthony Smellie, of spreading gossip, and of trying to oust him. Smellie said he had reprimanded her for allegedly making inappropriate courtroom remarks. Levers then sent rude letters about him to the local paper, under the pseudonym \"Leticia Barton\", he claimed. Levers denies it all and says she is the victim of a plot. The tribunal panel \u2013 two retired UK appeal judges, Sir Andrew Leggatt and Sir Philip Otton, and Sir David Simmons, chief justice of Barbados \u2013 plus counsel to the inquiry Timothy Otty QC and solicitors from the expensive City firm of Clifford Chance listened to two weeks of evidence from local lawyers and court staff. A stenographer claimed there were intolerable \"theatrics\" and sarcasms in Levers's court. The 63-year-old judge denied claims from another that she had been taking advice from a psychic. Incensed by the letters from \"Leticia Barton\", the chief justice had demanded the author be tracked down, it emerged during the hearings. But police were initially unwilling. The chief justice's colleague, Canadian expatriate judge Alexander Henderson, then asked a scuba-diving friend and local reporter to get more evidence. This allegedly led to the newspaper break-in and fresh accusations, of leaks by the police. The governor called in a dozen investigators from the Yard, led by Detective Superintendent Martin Bridger and supervised by Yates, who also made several trips to the island. Bridger's \"Operation Tempura\" culminated in attempts to arrest not only the police chief but also Henderson. Another veteran British Judge, Sir Peter Cresswell, then flew out to declare his fellow judge's arrest unlawful. Henderson was awarded $1m damages. Bridger returned to England and has now retired. The tribunal failed to uncover the mysterious \"Leticia Barton\", source of much of the trouble. But by next month they must report to Stuart Jack, the governor, on what to do about the Caymans' warring judges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
