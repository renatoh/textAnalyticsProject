Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was left out of Fulham's Capital One Cup tie at Sheffield Wednesday after Spurs agreed to pay the \u00a315m release clause in the Belgium international's contract. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 underwent a medical last night and will replace Luka Modric, who was sold to Real Madrid on Monday for \u00a330m. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, had also wanted Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and watched the 25-year-old put in an outstanding performance during Fulham's 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford last Saturday. However, the deposed champions were unable to reach a deal with Fulham and their bid was rejected. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is likely to be the first of a number of eye-catching arrivals at White Hart Lane ahead of Friday night's cut-off as Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas continues to reshape the squad left him at the club by his predecessor, Harry Redknapp. Tottenham are also confident of completing the signing of France's first-choice goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, from Lyon. The 25-year-old goalkeeper, who has been capped 38 times, is still considering the move to London but is understood to be inclined to accept the switch. Lyon, who have failed to qualify for this season's Champions League, are keen to sell and have indicated that a fee of \u00a313m would be acceptable. That transfer should be announced imminently, with Tottenham's interest in the Shakhtar Donetsk forward Willian also maintained. An initial bid worth \u00a311.8m for the Brazilian has already been rejected, but talks with the Ukrainian club are on-going in the hope a deal can still be struck with the player, who was close to joining Chelsea last January, keen for a fresh challenge in the Premier League. Tottenham, having sold Modric, will continue to press for reinforcements though the trimming of Villas-Boas's current squad is also set to continue with Van der Vaart close to rejoining his former club, Hamburg. Talks are underway over a fee for the 29-year-old. The Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, had initially hoped to secure around \u00a314m for a player signed from Real Madrid two years ago for a little over half that amount but Hamburg are hoping to reach a compromise over the fee at around \u00a310m. Van der Vaart is at the top end of Spurs' wage structure, on around \u00a370,000-a-week plus bonuses with two years on his contract, but the German club boast a third party investor in Klaus-Michael K\u00fchne who can help them sign players. The Dutchman, whose wife, Sylvie, still works in Germany, remains a cult hero in Hamburg having played for the club between 2005 and 2008. Tottenham's England midfielder, Tom Huddlestone, could still join Stoke City on loan though the clubs may have to reach a compromise over a loan fee after a medical prompted concern over the state of the player's ankle. Tottenham's helter-skelter end to the window could yet prompt them to revive interest in the Internacional striker Leandro Dami\u00e3o, a move that would cast doubt on Jermain Defoe's future at the club \u2013 though another player in whom Spurs had expressed an interest, the France midfielder Yann M'Vila, is likely to remain at Rennes for the time being. The French club have confirmed inquiries but no firm and acceptable offers had been made for the 22-year-old. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's arrival at White Hart Lane, meanwhile, means Sunderland's Kieron Richardson is likely to seal a move to Fulham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
