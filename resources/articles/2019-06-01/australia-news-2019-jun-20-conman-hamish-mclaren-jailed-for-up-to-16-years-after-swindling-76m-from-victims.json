Since being arrested at his home in Bondi in December 2017, through to his sentencing on Thursday, the serial fraudster who dressed like James Bond, drove Ferraris and defrauded $7.6m from more than a dozen people including close friends and girlfriends, had chosen to remain silent. \u201cThe man who had spent six years spinning yarns to people, having the gift of the gab, did not want to talk to police about what he had been doing and was unusually silent,\u201d Charteris said. What McLaren had shared \u2013 a one-page letter in which he said he was truly sorry and that he deserved the label of conman \u2013 had left Charteris unimpressed. The letter, Charteris said, contained \u201ca paucity of explanation\u201d. \u201cIt does not persuade me remotely that this man is sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not believe he has any remorse, I believe he is consumed by himself \u2026 the one focus was his wellbeing, so he could live, apparently, the high life, while spending the retirement savings of others.\u201d Charteris sentenced McLaren to 16 years in jail with a non-parole period of 12 years over a string of fake investments in which he defrauded 15 victims, including Australian fashion designer Lisa Ho. Wearing a grey suit, blue shirt and navy tie, McLaren rarely looked up during the lengthy sentencing, instead taking copious notes throughout the judge\u2019s remarks. He did not react when his sentence was handed down, but the public gallery, full of McLaren\u2019s victims, broke into applause. The court found McLaren had been \u201cmotivated by greed and not need\u201d in swindling millions from his victims, primarily through a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. The 49-year-old was arrested in 2017 after multiple faux investment schemes \u2013 including in currency, gold and shares in a \u201cprofitable\u201d Papua New Guinea gold mine \u2013 came unstuck. McLaren had no formal financial qualifications and on one occasion also pretended to be a practising barrister. He claimed to have been a graduate of Harvard business school, and used a number of aliases including Hamish Watson, Hamish Maxwell and Max Tavita. The court heard that he promised victims high returns on investments, in many cases encouraging them to access their superannuation funds or redraw from their mortgages. In most cases he did not invest their funds, instead transferred money between his accounts to be \u201cspent as he decided\u201d, including to help fund a lavish lifestyle that included frequent trips to the US and UK and an Aston Martin. He also used his victim\u2019s money to pay small amounts to other victims, often as a way to encourage them to give him more money. \u201cThis offender preyed upon the victims. He had the ability to persuade them to part with their money. He had no empathy for them,\u201d acting judge Charteris said. \u201cHe was driven by the main game, which was to obtain their money to spend as he wished.\u201d Calling McLaren\u2019s offending \u201cthe most reprehensible one could imagine\u201d, Charteris said McLaren had shown \u201cabsolutely no compassion\u201d for his victims and \u201cappeared to have no conscience\u201d in his offending. He said he had \u201cregrettably come to the view that Mr McLaren is not remorseful [and is] sorry for no one other than himself\u201d. \u201cMr McLaren is sorry for his own predicament and not truly sorry for the ruinous results of his outrageous conduct,\u201d he said. McLaren was the subject of the Australian newspaper\u2019s Who the Hell is Hamish podcast. The on-going series detailed allegations against McLaren going back three decades. At McLaren\u2019s sentencing hearing, his brother-in-law, Christopher Rourke, testified: \u201cHe would watch a James Bond movie and then dress like James Bond. Same suit, same hair.\u201d McLaren\u2019s victims are still owed a total of $5.4m, or $900,000 a year over the six years of his offending. On Thursday, Charteris joined McLaren\u2019s victims in questioning where that money was. \u201cEven James Bond would have trouble spending $900,000 a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary sum of money [and] no real explanation has been given for where it is. \u201cI cannot conclude that some of the money is not still in this country or overseas, all I can say is the endeavours of police have not been able to locate it but I simply cannot say he spent it all.\u201d Outside the court, some of his victims said they felt \u201chappy and sad\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s happened \u2026 the next question is where is the money,\u201d one said. A number of his victims said they were sure McLaren had money hidden off shore but that finding it would be \u201clike tracking a flock of pigeons\u201d. McLaren will be eligible for parole in July 2029."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
