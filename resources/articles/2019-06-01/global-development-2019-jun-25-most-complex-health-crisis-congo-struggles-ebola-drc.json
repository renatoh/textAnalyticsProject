When he himself fell sick he sought treatment in secret. His family don\u2019t believe the virus exists and think a man in their village poisoned them. Refusal to believe in the existence of Ebola is one difficulty for doctors who say the current outbreak of the deadly virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the \u201cmost complex public health emergency in history\u201d and warn it could drag on for months. Following two deaths across the border in Uganda two weeks ago, officials admit they are struggling to identify and track cases around the north-eastern city of Butembo, particularly in countryside dominated by the Mai Mai militia and where a highly mobile population mean cases continue to emerge. The outbreak, with more than 2,100 cases and more than 1,412 confirmed deaths in just over a year, is the second largest in history, despite recent availability of an effective experimental vaccine. Centred on three locations in North Kivu \u2013 Beni, Mangina and Butembo \u2013 the response led by the World Health Organization and DRC\u2019s ministry of health faces political security and cultural complexities. Among them is widespread resistance to the idea that Ebola exists, a conspiracy fuelled by some political candidates in last year\u2019s national elections. In Butembo, a population dominated by the Nande ethnic group, a false narrative has also emerged that the virus \u2013 if it exists \u2013 has been brought in from outside to target a people who have long felt victimised in the region\u2019s interminable conflicts. The city has seen armed assaults on Ebola treatment centres, the murder of a WHO doctor, and frequent attacks on vaccination teams. In the latest incident, on Monday last week, a driver working with an Ebola response team in the neighbouring city of Beni was left in critical condition after angry crowds hurled rocks at him and set his vehicle on fire. \u201cWe are looking at one of the most complex health emergencies the world has seen,\u201d says John Johnson of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), whose teams pulled out of Butembo over security risks. He was one of three officials who framed the crisis in similar terms. Moise Kitsakihu-Mbira is now a motorbike ambulance driver who discreetly brings the sick to the treatment centre from communities where stigma remains. \u201cIt was my grandson who died first,\u201d he tells the Guardian. Many family members touched the body \u2013 highly risky as Ebola is spread through physical contact with victims\u2019 bodies or those showing symptoms. They started dying. First his brother, then, one after another, twelve others. \u201cEven when they were told it was Ebola, the family wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey threw stones at the team sent to offer vaccinations. They thought it was poison.\u201d The man accused of poisoning the family was killed by other villagers. Moise did believe in Ebola\u2019s existence and sought treatment when he too fell sick, despite his local doctor telling him that Ebola was not real. \u201cI was telling people that it wasn\u2019t poison,\u201d he recalled. Finally he visited a hospital where Ebola was confirmed. Even then, as he sent texts telling his family where he was, his wife refused the vaccine for herself and their children. * * * Despite its sprawling size and the constant buzz of motorbike taxis, Butembo feels neglected, with potholed dirt roads, open sewers, crumbling infrastructure and its perfect storm of overlapping issues that conspire to hamper the Ebola response. It\u2019s a major commercial centre, and residents trade widely, across the borders into Uganda and Rwanda. Unlike Beni where the main militia \u2013 the Allied Democratic Forces \u2013 are located in the countryside, the Mai Mai are embedded within the population of Butembo, with political links. Even by DRC standards, a strong hostility has emerged here not only to central government but to all outsiders. Dr Ibrahima Soc\u00e9 Fall, the senior WHO official for the Ebola response in Butembo, described the reaction to the arrival of his teams last year in the midst of national elections. Even those who accepted Ebola\u2019s existence were not necessarily happy to see them. \u201cThe view was \u2013 you\u2019re only here for Ebola, and when that is over you\u2019ll go and we will have all the same problems as before.\u201d Conspiracies spiralled. Some centred on the disease, others on the treatment centres. In the midst of this febrile atmosphere the government made the catastrophic decision to cancel voting in the virus-struck region, contributing further to the wildest theories about the outbreak as a political tool. Privately, some of those involved in the medical response also concede that mistakes have been made. Medical teams assumed that the epidemic would follow a similar pattern to recent outbreaks in west Africa, and were blindsided by the hostility and suspicion, recognising too late that political negotiation, as well as medical intervention, was needed. \u201cThe biggest problem has been security. I think if we had the access we need, we could have finished dealing with it a long time ago,\u201d says Soc\u00e9\u2019s colleague Michel Yao, in charge of the day-to-day WHO response. \u201cEvery time there was an incident we would be prevented from working for three to four days. There would be demonstrations and anyone could be attacked. We became the target.\u201d In the most serious incident, on 19 April, Dr Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, a Cameroonian epidemiologist, was killed at Butembo\u2019s University Hospital. According to colleagues, Dr Kiboung was wearing his hospital scrubs but nothing that identified him as working for WHO at the hospital. As he attended a meeting in the conference room, armed men burst into the room. Forcing those present to the floor, the gunmen accused the assembled health workers of \u201cperpetuating false rumours about Ebola\u201d before shooting the doctor in the stomach. Armed assailants also attacked Ebola treatment centres in Butembo and Katwa, then run by MSF, burning parts of the facilities and firing at buildings. This upsurge of violence has forced medical teams to travel with armed escorts and to reinforce clinics with sand-bagged protection. And an atmosphere of risk persists. During the Guardian\u2019s visit to the main coordination centre in Katwa, four men suspected of being Mai Mai militia infiltrated the compound. Two fled and two were arrested by guards. No one is clear about precise motives. * * * What has changed dramatically since the first cases last year is the emergence of new facilities and tactics to deal with the disease. Although some 300 health centres were listed at the beginning of the outbreak, many of those, admits Dr Soc\u00e9, were desperately basic. \u201cThey were often just one room and some of them [were used] for traditional medicine. People would be drinking out of the same pot or a syringe would be used ten times. A child would go in for treatment for malaria and come out with Ebola.\u201d Dedicated centres have now been built in key locations where medical staff in biohazard suits, looking like visiting astronauts, bustle between isolation units and decontamination showers. Meals are delivered to patients in observation areas via slides while in plastic isolation cubes, in controlled environments, doctors work on the most serious cases. There is lodging for relatives, and children are cared for by Ebola survivors immune to catching the virus a second time. There is a morgue and purpose-built screened area where families can view a body ahead of the burial process. Vaccinations have been speeded up and a half dose of vaccine has been found to be as effective as the full shot. It remains exhausting work. \u201cWe have the vaccine and new ways of treating the disease,\u201d says Dr Marie-Claire Kolie, a Guinean doctor in Butembo who worked on Ebola in her own country. \u201cThe big difference is that this is occurring in a conflict zone and that is accentuating everything. We\u2019ve seen the numbers of cases in the centres declining, and that\u2019s good news, but we are still seeing deaths in the community and they are difficult to investigate. And there\u2019s still no confidence in the community even now. \u201cWe\u2019re still facing a problem of fake news and rumours circulating on WhatsApp groups.\u201d Those continuing difficulties were dramatically underlined when a family of six travelled into Uganda from the Mabalako area outside Butembo \u2013 a difficult location with little government presence \u2013 with two victims of Ebola among them. Cases from this area have also reintroduced the disease into areas in the north-east of the DRC, thought to be under control. \u201cIt was very clear in the first weeks of the outbreak,\u201d says Dr Soc\u00e9, \u201cthat it was going to be complicated. And if it was not controlled it would become even more complicated. \u201cEven so, what happened later, with the security situation and the cancellation of the elections \u2026 We didn\u2019t expect that to happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
