A spokeswoman for administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers could not confirm how many of Breathe's 140 staff would be axed, or whether the cuts would be made at the company's Warrington or London offices. \"The company continues to trade as a going concern whilst it seeks a buyer, but the administrators have to run it within tight financial overheads,\" she added. The job losses come as the free access portal searches for a buyer in a hostile market which has already refused to rescue online retailer Letsbuyit.com. Breathe called in the administrators in December last year after it collapsed with debts of \u00a350m. At the time, PwC said it did not plan any job cuts, but the lack of interest in an ISP with only 500,000 subscribers has forced it to hand out the P45s. The spokeswoman confirmed that PwC administrator Mike Horrocks had not received any acceptable offers, but said he was still negotiating with a number of potential buyers. However, today's announcement means that time is running out for the company founded by mobile phone entrepreneur Martin Dawes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
