Matthew Hedges, 31, a PhD student at Durham University, flew to the UAE on 5 May to interview sources about the country\u2019s foreign policy and security strategy. He was detained at Dubai airport on his way home and his family said he had been held in solitary confinement since then. On Monday, the UAE government said Hedges had been charged with spying. In a joint statement, Durham and Exeter universities said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about his welfare. The statement said: \u201cMatt is suffering from significant health issues after more than five months in detention. His welfare and right to a fair trial are now the overriding concerns of both Durham and Exeter universities.\u201d Both universities called on the authorities in the UAE and the UK to \u201ctreat Matt with proper fairness and to make every effort to return Matt to his wife, Daniela, and his family and friends\u201d. They added that the court had been assured of Hedges\u2019 status as a PhD student \u201cin good standing\u201d. Hedges completed a masters degree in Middle East studies at Exeter and began working on his PhD at Durham in 2013. The universities said: \u201cMatt\u2019s thesis is nearing completion and was carried out in full accordance with Durham University\u2019s research and ethics procedures. His academic colleagues speak highly of his work, noting both his diligence and level of scholarship, as well as his undoubted passion and care for the Arab Gulf and its people.\u201d Hedges\u2019 wife, Daniela Tejada, has appealed publicly for his release. She said her husband had been kept in solitary confinement since his arrest, forced to sleep on the floor for months and had suffered from anxiety and depression. She urged the British government to state that he was innocent of the charges. The Foreign Office said last week that the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had raised the case with his UAE counterpart. Hedges has been allowed two visits by FCO officials, during which he is said to have been barred from discussing his case, and one visit by his wife. Hedges was arrested after an Emirati apparently reported him to the authorities for \u201casking sensitive questions about some sensitive departments\u201d and \u201cseeking to gather classified information on the UAE\u201d."}, "isHosted": false}}}
