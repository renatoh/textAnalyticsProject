Donald Trump has set the stage for the nastiest US presidential race in modern times with a campaign rally in Florida that recycled old themes and stoked resentment towards Democrats and the media. The president spent little effort offering a vision of the future, instead filling the air of the Amway Center in Orlando with grievance politics \u2013 demonising opponents and raging against perceived injustices in a string of vicious, often fabricated attacks. \u201cImagine if we had a Democrat president and Democrat Congress in 2020. They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents, which they are trying to do now anyway.\u201d He added, without evidence: \u201cThey would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base.\u201d The president appeared to openly boast of having the country\u2019s judiciary in his pocket, pointing out 145 judges had been appointed under his administration. Whipping up the crowd, he retired his slogan of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (Maga) for the arguably less memorable \u201cKeep America Great\u201d (Kag). The Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders gave an immediate rebuttal. Watching Trump\u2019s speech had been an \u201cextremely unpleasant experience\u201d, he said. Describing it as \u201clies, distortions, and total absolute nonsense\u201d, Sanders criticised Trump for not talking about the climate emergency, or that \u201chalf of the people in this country are working paycheque to paycheque\u201d. * * * Edge-of-stool encounter \u2013 \u201cIt was called Our Next Prime Minister and as the hour wore on, those four words sounded increasingly like a rebuke to the nation \u2026 one of these five jokers is actually going to be our next prime minister.\u201d Jonathan Freedland\u2019s assessment after last night\u2019s Tory leadership debate. Dominic Raab wasn\u2019t there, having earlier been voted out of the running by MPs. The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson remains overwhelming favourite, with 126 votes of the 313 cast in the latest round. He was forced on to the defensive in the BBC encounter on issues from Islamophobia (including a question from an imam whose name Johnson immediately forgot) to cutting taxes for top earners. After a debate where the participants\u2019 awkward seating was notable, Peter Walker wraps up their winning and losing lines. On the Labour side, Jeremy Corbyn is tipped to give a speech in the coming days that will outline his latest Brexit strategy but fall well short of satisfying demands for wholehearted support for a second referendum \u2013 or the provocative call by his deputy, Tom Watson, to \u201cbe bolder, be braver, take a stand\u201d and back remain. Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet meets today to discuss Brexit and hear a polling presentation underlining the fact that Labour\u2019s vote is being squeezed both by the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Amid Brexit uncertainty and financial pressures, Britain\u2019s universities have seen their international rankings tumble for a third year. Cambridge slipped from sixth to seventh, its lowest-ever position, though Oxford rose from fifth to fourth overall \u2013 and is about to receive its biggest single donation \u201csince the Renaissance\u201d. &gt; Britain saw a big jump in the working poor between 1994 and 2017, with the share of poverty accounted for by working households going up from 37% to 58%. The IFS said the less well-off had been financially hit by more expensive housing and weak earnings growth, but were still better off employed than unemployed. &gt; Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level in 25 years after the introduction of price controls. But there are still, on average, 22 alcohol-specific deaths a week, 683 hospital admissions, and Scots still drank an average of 9.9 litres of pure alcohol in 2018 \u2013 equal to nearly 40 bottles of vodka. &gt; Hundreds of Roma people have been forcibly evicted from a village in western Russia after one ethnic Russian was killed and others injured amid brawling and arson attacks. The incident is a troubling case of ethnic tensions in small Russian towns and Roma communities, which gain little support from the government. &gt; A three-year sweep of 1,327 stars has picked up no signals from possible alien life. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet out there,\u201d said Danny Price from the Breakthrough Listen project. The astronomers haven\u2019t finished \u2013 they aim to scan a million nearby stars, the entire plane of the Milky Way and 100 neighbouring galaxies. * * * Jab of doubt \u2013 There is a crisis of confidence towards vaccines in Europe, with only 59% of people in the west and 50% in the east believing they are safe, compared with 79% worldwide, according to a study. Dr Heidi Larson, the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said confidence in vaccines in the UK was higher than in some other parts of Europe but \u201cwhere the UK is now I would say is vulnerable\u201d. In France, experts say the scepticism reflects the public\u2019s distrust of politicians. * * * Adapt or perish, emitters told \u2013 Polluting businesses are being warned they will be \u201cpurposefully disrupted\u201d as the government seeks to spur the move to a zero-carbon economy by 2050. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) says that for example, companies involved in the UK\u2019s gas networks or the North Sea may need to consider \u201can exit, or managed decline\u201d. Heating, transport and construction are squarely in the sights, with UKERC saying they face \u201cstarkly divergent futures \u2013 including futures where their core assets will need to be phased out\u201d. Separately, two-thirds of people polled for Greener UK and the Climate Coalition have said Britain needs to cut its carbon emissions to zero much faster. And as children prepare for a fresh school climate strike on Friday, a study of 2,000 parents and 1,500 children has found the generation born since 2010, the so-called Alpha generation, are emerging as the next generation of protesters \u2013 informed about the climate crisis, tech-savvy and well vaccinated against fake news. * * * Reprieve for debtors \u2013 People struggling with serious debt are to benefit from a two-month \u201cbreathing space\u201d during which they cannot be hassled by debt collectors and bailiffs, and their interest, fees and charges will be frozen. Those experiencing mental health issues will receive extra protection, the Treasury says.

Business Workers of Chinese descent in America\u2019s technology sector are facing a backlash in the wake of the trade war with China, according to a survey. One anonymous worker said they felt \u201clike a target\u201d as Chinese companies such as Huawei became increasingly intertwined in the dispute. The trade war is also dominating thoughts among investors who appeared confident today that Donald Trump and Xi Jingping can reach a deal to settle the issue at next week\u2019s G20 summit. Asia stocks were up on the mood of optimism which also plugged into hopes that the US federal reserve might later today hint at rate cuts this year. The FTSE100 is, however, set to open slightly down, while the pound is an anaemic $1.256 and \u20ac1.122.
