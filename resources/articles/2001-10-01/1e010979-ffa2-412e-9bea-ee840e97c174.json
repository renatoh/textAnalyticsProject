Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has written to Scotland's First Minster, Henry McLeish, confirming that any transfer of funding would be financially unsustainable and against the spirit of the Scotland Act. But Nicola Sturgeon, SNP Shadow Health and Community Care Minister, said yesterday: 'London Labour is sending out a clear message to the Scottish Executive that they are firmly in charge, and are clearly warning the Scottish Parliament to remain subservient to Westminster. 'The whole point of devolution was for the Scottish Parliament to pass legislation that was right for Scotland, but London Labour are intent on preventing Scotland from going its own way, even on devolved matters.' The Executive has been engaged in negotiations with the Department of Work and Pensions in recent months over which arm of government should keep cash currently claimed by the elderly in Scotland when they are eligible for free care. The First Minister believes the money should stay in Scotland to pay for his care plans. 'It is utterly disgraceful that Westminster should treat the people of Scotland is this manner,' continued Sturgeon. 'Westminster is going to pocket more than \u00a320 million of Scottish taxpayers' money simply because they disagree with the progressive and socially just policy of providing free personal care for the elderly. It is daylight robbery. 'All that is required is for a straightforward transfer of benefits, but Alistair Darling is making London Labour's views on free personal care perfectly clear - they oppose it and will do anything to undermine the will of the Scottish Parliament.' McLeish is thought to be determined to pursue the matter further. With free personal care expected to cost a total of \u00a3140m a year, one official has said the Executive will take its case up with other Whitehall offices, such as the Treasury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
