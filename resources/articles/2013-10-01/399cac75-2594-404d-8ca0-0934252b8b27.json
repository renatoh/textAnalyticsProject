She reveals that as a barrister she noticed a change in her male colleagues' attitude towards her when pregnant with her first child. But as a self-confessed \"stubborn Scouser\" she said she was determined to prove she could have a career and a family life. She was influenced, she said, by the experience of her mother, who gave up acting to look after her children and, when abandoned by her husband, took a job in a fish and chip shop. \"In some ways I was lucky,\" she wrote in an essay to mark the 30th anniversary celebrations of the charity, 4Children. \"The fact that barristers are self-employed meant I was able to 'marinate' while my older children were very young and it did not ultimately hold me back from having a successful legal career. This was a sacrifice I was prepared to make to have a family.\" Booth admits that she bought into the long hours culture. \"I was so intent as a young lawyer on beating the men at their own game that I didn't take any real maternity leave with my three younger children. It is only looking back that I realise I wasn't beating the system but reinforcing it.\" After the birth of her third child, which she admits she thought would be her last, she was able to \"move up a gear\" and \"take chances\" which she did by \"moving to a bigger chambers and later still forming my own chambers Matrix\". As a working mother of four she recognises that over the past 30 years changes in the availability of childcare have made it easier to juggle work and family life but argues that there are still too many barriers to mothers working. She suggests expanding the mentoring programme that she supports through the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women. Those who are going back to work after having a child should be given special help through \"returnships\" that act like an apprenticeship in easing them back into the workplace. Support should also be given to parents who choose to care full-time for their children and a Scandinavian style of universal childcare should be made available to all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
