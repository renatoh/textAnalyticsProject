City were sloppy at times and Guardiola was unhappy at what he perceived as a slip from his side\u2019s usual high standards. He pointed to a second-half Bernardo Silva miss to highlight the point. \u201cThe ball got passed to Bernardo and I said: \u2018It is impossible that he is going to miss it because of his quality,\u2019\u201d the manager said. \u201cBut he missed it and I said: \u2018Wow.\u2019 \u201cMy reaction and extra expression is when they miss the simple things. That, I cannot handle in myself. So one guy has the ball and they miss the ball and an extra simple pass, an extra touch, an extra touch and after miss the pass, that is why I am still angry. I am upset with my players and they know that. \u201cWe spoke about that many times, about goals or assists or dribbling. [A mistake] doesn\u2019t matter, but control the ball and pass the ball simple. If they miss that \u2013 and there was many of that \u2013 that\u2019s why [in training] I am going to show them we can improve.\u201d Guardiola said the players shared his emotions. \u201cThey are maybe angrier than me,\u201d he said and, although he insisted he had no fear that the team might be complacent after achieving 100 points last season, he hopes this will act as a wake-up callwith City\u2019s Champions League campaign starting at home against Lyon on Wednesday. \u201cPass the ball two or three metres, don\u2019t miss that ball, and it happened a few times, especially in the first half,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cAnd the teams at the top level they punish you a lot. But normally after international breaks this kind of thing happens. It can happen, with the travel, [only] one training session. Now we start. Until the Liverpool game [7 October] we will be here for one month with a game every three days, so everyone is going to settle.\u201d After five Premier League games City are joint-top scorers \u2013 alongside Chelsea \u2013 with 14 goals. On Saturday they took control inside two minutes through Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s opener before David Silva and, early in the second half, Raheem Sterling secured the win. \u201cLast season we scored 106 goals, the best ever, so there are no doubts about our ability to score goals,\u201d said Guardiola, who believed City could have scored more against Fulham. \u201cThe important thing is to create chances. So how many times in the second half we shoot and always [hit] the post or the keeper or the central defender. The important thing is to create, to be in there. \u201cWe knew this game after the international break would be dangerous because Fulham ask a lot of opponents. They didn\u2019t come here to defend and play long balls, just to wait for set pieces, they came to play their own game.\u201d Liverpool won 2-1 at Tottenham to maintain their perfect start. Guardiola, having watched the opening 45 minutes of that game, believes J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team are contenders for City\u2019s title and welcomed the challenge. \u201cLiverpool is a really strong side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have contenders \u2013 to try to beat them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
