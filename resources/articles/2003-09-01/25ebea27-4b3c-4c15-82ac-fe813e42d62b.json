Despite suggestions of such a move in the summer, Steve McLaren refused to meet Sunderland's \u00a34m valuation and the 30-year-old - the highest-profile departure from the Stadium of Light following the club's relegation - went on to sign for Southampton instead. \"If there was any chance, I would have gone,\" said Phillips. \"My house in the north-east was nearer to Middlesbrough's training ground than it was Sunderland's. That would have been ideal.\" Phillips finally completed his \u00a33.25m move away from Wearside on the eve of the new season, and proved his worth when coming off the bench in at Leicester. He scored with a spectacular long-range strike before setting up James Beattie's equaliser in a 2-2 draw despite the death of his mother that week. Sunderland's decline from a side challenging for Europe to relegation was painful for Phillips, who admitted he saw it coming. \"We never really went out and bought the big names that I and the supporters were promised,\" he said. Phillips wrote himself into Wearside folklore by scoring the winning goal at Newcastle to condemn Ruud Gullit to a premature exit in August 1999, and won eight caps for England. However, he never had the chance to prove himself on a sustained basis for England, and is keeping his fingers crossed for Beattie. \"I'm just hoping that James gets treated decently and, if he gets his chance, I'm sure he'll take it.\" The Liberian former world footballer of the year George Weah wants to become Nigeria's coach, according to the Nigerian newspaper the Vanguard. \"If I have the opportunity, why not? Nigeria is one of the big African names and I am capable of coaching the Super Eagles,\" Weah, a former player-coach of Liberia, was reported to have said. The Nigerian Football Association has already short-listed six foreigners, including the Frenchmen Bruno Metsu and Alain Giresse and Poland's Henri Kasperczak for the job. Weah did not orginally apply for the post. The NFA has said it will name a new coach in time for next January's African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia. NFA officials were unavailable for comment yesterday. Weah retired from international football last year after taking Liberia to the Nations Cup in Mali, where they made a first-round exit. Senegal's Pape Bouba Diop scored after only six minutes to give his team a 1-0 victory over Japan in a friendly Niigata. Senegal took the lead with their first meaningful attack when the Lens midfielder climbed to meet a right-wing corner by Henri Camara."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
