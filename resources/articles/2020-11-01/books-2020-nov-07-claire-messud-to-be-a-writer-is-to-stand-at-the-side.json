She was born in Connecticut, the daughter of an Algerian pied-noir father and a Canadian mother. She studied at Cambridge University, where she met her husband, the author and critic James Wood. They now live in Massachusetts, where Messud teaches at Harvard, with two teenage children and two beagles. Her latest book, Kant\u2019s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write, a collection of essays and reviews from the past 20 years, was published last month. What inspired the title of this collection? The title comes from Thomas Bernhard writing about how Kant is reduced to his \u201clittle East Prussian head\u201d but also to a single sentence, a mere philosophical hue. It\u2019s about the fact that we can\u2019t really take in everything we read in a book. When you think about what you remember of a book a month later or a year later, it\u2019s a distillation \u2013 sometimes you remember an image or a scene or a moment in the plot, or an idea in an essay. You don\u2019t actively remember the entire experience, at least not consciously. My father used to say that culture is what\u2019s left when you\u2019ve forgotten everything. Your mother is an important figure in your personal essays \u2013 her struggle with dementia overlaps with your ideas about memory\u2026 In the early days of brain surgery \u2013 and you know that you\u2019re awake for brain surgery \u2013 they realised when they started poking at the patients\u2019 cerebellums that everything is in there. If they poke a certain spot the patient says: \u201cI\u2019m on a boat on a lake with my parents. I\u2019m nine. This is what the air smells like.\u201d My mother had a particular type of dementia, Lewy bodies. Somebody explained it to me as: \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s locks the filing cabinet of the mind, while Lewy bodies turns the cabinet over on to the floor.\u201d So it\u2019s all there but mixed up. So where it overlaps with the idea of what we retain from our reading is that it\u2019s all there. It comes back to Proust and his madeleine \u2013 you don\u2019t know what moment will bring back experiences or memories, whether they\u2019re things you\u2019ve lived or things you\u2019ve read. To what extent does your background \u2013 you describe yourself as a mongrel \u2013 both help and hinder your writing? It\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve long pondered. In some ways, to be a writer is to stand at the side, to be the observer, to be liminal. Wittgenstein said that all philosophy is neurosis. If you\u2019re not neurotic then you don\u2019t even have to write anything down, you\u2019re just busy living. Alice Munro, whose work I adore, is incredibly rooted in place: she lives a short distance from where she went to school. I cling to Salman Rushdie\u2019s Imaginary Homelands essay. Even if you only move a hundred miles from where you grew up, you can never go back. The place you left is busy changing just as you\u2019re changing. There\u2019s an essay here, Teenage Girls, about your daughter and her friends, that feels like it might have been the source material for your novel The Burning Girl\u2026 I was prompted to write that novel when I did because I had a teenage daughter, but also because I was driving my daughter and her friends around so much. There\u2019s that funny thing where you\u2019re invisible to them, as if you were the Russian chauffeur \u2013 they don\u2019t think you understand what they\u2019re saying. If you\u2019re lucky, they behave as they would if you weren\u2019t there. I had wanted to try to write a fictional version of the experience I had when I was young. Lorrie Moore wrote in a review of a book about teenagers that adolescence is a howling dog; eventually it\u2019s buried, but it\u2019s buried alive. I found that as I was living my daughter\u2019s teenage years as a parent, it was bringing back all of this unprocessed, howling stuff in me. You write regular reviews for the New York Review of Books. What happens when you run into someone you\u2019ve given a bad review to? I remember years ago in London introducing two people at a party without realising that one had reviewed the other. The review had not been generous and the writer who had been reviewed looked at the reviewer and said: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t expect you to be fat.\u201d Now, I know as a writer that there are two kinds of reviews: there are reviews that are nice or are not nice, and there are reviews that are engaged with what you\u2019re trying to do as a writer and those that aren\u2019t. Anything that seeks to engage with what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m grateful for. I might feel wounded or sad if the reviewer doesn\u2019t feel I did what I set out to do, but as long as they\u2019re trying to understand what I set out to do then that feels like a gift. So, for example, the number of US reviews of The Burning Girl that began \u201cThis is a YA novel.\u201d And it could be a nice review or a not nice review, but I\u2019d think: \u201cMeh. That\u2019s a waste of paper.\u201d And so that\u2019s what I try to do myself as a reviewer: trying not to ask the question \u201cDo I like it?\u201d but \u201cWhat is it? And what is it trying to do?\u201d What books are on your bedside table? Too many to mention them all. Jacques Attali\u2019s L\u2019Ann\u00e9e des Dupes Alger 1943; Map: Collected and Last Poems, by Wislawa Szymborska, Maaza Mengiste\u2019s The Shadow King, which is quite wonderful. How do you organise your books? Once upon a time, alphabetically. Now, though, it\u2019s sheer guesswork as to where a book is. If I need it, the chances are it will be buried three books deep. What do you read for sheer pleasure? During lockdown we\u2019ve been reading Tolstoy. The novelist Yiyun Li has been running a War and Peace book group online, and we read Anna Karenina to one another over the dinner table, me, James and the kids. Which book would you give to a 12-year-old? Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier. \u2022 Kant\u2019s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write by Claire Messud is published by Little, Brown (\u00a314.99).
