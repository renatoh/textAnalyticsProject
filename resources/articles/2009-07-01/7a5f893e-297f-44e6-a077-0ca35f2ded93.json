The 19-year-old Spaniard, who is set to become the youngest F1 driver, completed 82 laps of the testing Hungaroring without causing any problems for either himself or his competitors. Alguersuari felt he had vindicated the decision by Toro Rosso to replace S\u00e9bastien Bourdais with a novice who had not driven an F1 car in anger until practice began this morning. \"I'm quite happy with how today has gone, especially this morning, when I had a good pace and felt quite confident,\" said Alguersuari. \"In the second session, my lap time could have been better but I didn't get a clean lap. I'm learning all the time. The hardest part was the entry into the high-speed corners, which I need to take much faster, but that will come as my confidence grows and I do more kilometres.\" Alguersuari completed more than a race distance, although he was fortunate that the Hungaroring has few fast corners. A fault-free day and a best lap time that was 0.74sec slower than his team-mate, S\u00e9bastien Buemi, answered fears that he would be a liability on such a tight track. Franz Tost, team principal at Toro Rosso, defended his decision to hire the young Catalan. \"Red Bull bought this team to give young drivers the chance to come into Formula One,\" he said. \"Alguersuari was the fastest and the most experienced of those available. He may be the youngest but he was done 118 races, won 17, been on the podium 36 times and won last year's British F3 championship. He's not as inexperienced as people seem to think.The reason he started here is that he finished sixth in a race at the Hungaroring five weeks ago, which meant he was familiar with the track. It would have been a greater risk to have started him [at the next races] at Valencia or Spa.\" Lewis Hamilton underlined that improvements to his McLaren are paying dividends by recording today's fastest time. That indicated the world champion could have an influence on the fight for this year's title between Brawn and Red Bull. The slippery conditions on the dusty and hot track make it difficult to draw conclusions as Mark Webber set the fourth fastest time, two places ahead of Sebastian Vettel. The Brawns of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button were seventh and 13th. \"A productive day, and we're pleased with the amount of set-up work that we have been able to achieve,\" said Ross Brawn. \"The initial feedback from the performance improvements that we've brought to this race looks positive. The temperatures were pretty much as we expected with the hot conditions enabling us to make reasonable use of the tyres and develop our understanding of their performance characteristics. We will now look through the data to ensure we are ready for qualifying, which is crucial here as there are limited overtaking opportunities.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
