The high-end series of devices, which includes a tiny digital camera and a gold/silver-plated MiniDisc personal, initially went on sale in Japan in late 2003. The first products to be released in the UK include the Qualia 004, a high definition home cinema projector scheduled for next month, and the Qualia 005, a HDTV-compatible LCD TV with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which will be released in the autumn. www.sony.co.uk Console wars Microsoft is attempting to get the jump on Sony by announcing its next-generation Xbox 2 games console on MTV on May 12-13, instead of waiting for the important E3 games trade exhibition. Last week, Sony tried to upstage Microsoft, saying it would unveil its PlayStation 3 on May 16, a few hours before Microsoft's E3 event, and one day before Nintendo's. Microsoft is expected to highlight its new machine's HDTV, entertainment and online features in the 30-minute MTV special, but may upset the games trade by revealing things to fans before it tells them. Digital cameras Slim snaps The latest in Sony's superslim T-range of compact digital cameras will debut in the UK next month. Already on sale in Japan, the DSC-T7 is just 9.8mm thick at its thinnest point, but includes a 2.5in LCD screen and a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens with a 3x optical zoom. It can take 5.1 megapixel images. The T7, which is finished in stainless steel, also includes a power management system that apparently extends shooting time. www.sony.co.uk Video chat Take up Spaces Microsoft has announced MSN Messenger 7 with a free Video Conversation service \"powered by Logitech technology\" for one-click chatting online. Although MSN has offered video chat for years, the new service is said to provide good quality full-screen video. It also makes it easier to share and swap photos. Microsoft adds that UK customers will soon be able to send SMS text messages from MSN Messenger to mobile phones. Finally, MSN Messenger works with MSN Spaces, Microsoft's blogging service, which has just completed its beta test with more than 4.5m Spaces created. http://messenger.msn.co.uk http://spaces.msn.co.uk Televisions Get set Korean company Humax is aiming for those who want a one box solution for their living room, with the LGB32-TPVR, a 32in LCD TV that also boasts a 40GB hard disk video recorder. The set, left, comes with a pair of Freeview digital terrestrial TV tuners, so users can record one digital channel while watching another. Up to 30 hours of programmes can be stored on its hard disk. The screen itself is WXGA (wide extended graphics array) 1366 x 768 resolution, although, as it does not feature an HDMI (high definition multimedia interface) socket, it is not compatible with forthcoming Sky high definition TV broadcasts. It will be on sale shortly for \u00a31,700. www.humaxdigital.com/uk Media players Play into your hands MP3 Plus has unveiled the T7, pictured above, one of the first compact USB-endowed Flash memory-based devices to sport a colour screen and feature video playback. The T7, available in 512MB, 1GB or 2GB versions, features a 1.3in screen that can play back moving images with resolution of 120 x 160 pixels at 25 frames per second. The model also boasts MP3 playback and is compatible with copyright-protected Windows Media Audio files from online music stores such as Napster. Other features include an FM tuner and a voice-recording option. The T7, which is on sale shortly, will retail for \u00a3109 (512MB), \u00a3130 (1GB) and \u00a3219 (2GB). www.mp3-plus.net \u00b7 Contributions from Ashley Norris and Jack Schofield Stat of the week Data trouble Computer crime costs British business almost \u00a32.5bn a year \u2014 but almost half is down to insiders, says the National High Tech Crime Unit.
