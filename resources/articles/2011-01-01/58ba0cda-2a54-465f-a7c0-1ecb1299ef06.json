Subs not used Anders Lindegaard, Fabio, Gabriel Obertan, Darron Gibson. Liverpool Pepe Reina The Spaniard made some good saves in those moments in the second half when United sought to soothe the crowd's nerves with a second goal. 7 Martin Kelly Brought into the side for Glen Johnson, whose wife had gone into labour, he played well enough to give Kenny Dalglish a difficult decision when the team go to Blackpool on Wednesday. 6 Daniel Agger Liverpool harboured a deep sense of injustice about the penalty but, whatever the villainy of Berbatov's tumble, Agger should have known better than to flick out his foot. Solid afterwards but a big error. 6 Martin Skrtel A strong performance from the centre-half even if there were times when he found Berbatov an elusive opponent. 7 F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio Liverpool supporters will always prefer to see him at left-back rather than Paul Konchesky and it is a pity for Dalglish that the Brazilian has such a prolific injury record. 7 Dirk Kuyt The usual hard work and application but what Liverpool really needed was someone in midfield with the ability to play the killer pass. 6 Raul Meireles The only Liverpool player on the pitch to be signed by Roy Hodgson, his impact was minimal, often on the edges of the game. 5 Lucas He, like Kuyt, can be guaranteed to cover a lot of ground but there are still reservations about his ability on the ball. 6 Maxi Rodr\u00edguez: Liverpool's right-sided midfielder had their only genuine chance of the first half but there was very little else from him before his withdrawal. 5 Steven Gerrard Gerrard's competitive qualities have helped make him a formidable player but on this occasion he let down his team. 4 Fernando Torres The expectation was of a player who would be rejuvenated now Roy Hodgson has gone, yet Torres disappointed again, both in his performance and in his body language, and it speaks volumes he was substituted when Liverpool needed a goal. 5 Subs Ryan Babel and Jonjo Shelvey for Maxi and Meireles, both 60, David Ngog for Torres 77. Subs not used Peter Gulacsi, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Danny Wilson, Christian Poulsen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
