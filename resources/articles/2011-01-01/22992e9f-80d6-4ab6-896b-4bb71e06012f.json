But what happens to those who have dedicated their life to the pursuit of a medal? After all that blood and sweat, what if you don't make it? Even if you do, somebody younger, fitter and hungrier will eventually come along and smash your hard-earned records. What do you do when you're all washed up on dry land? These are the questions raised by Amphibians, which unearths a Victorian swimming pool beneath the Bridewell to terrific effect, creating a show about winners and losers that, at its considerable best, does for swimming what Beautiful Burnout does for boxing. The central encounter, between former Olympic colleagues and lovers Elsa and Max, is a tad awkward, and though Steve Waters's script is full of meditations on effort and sacrifice, it is a little short on character development, despite the actors' best efforts. Nevertheless, this is an atmospheric and hugely promising work, at its best when it explores the churning depths beneath the calm surface of the mind. In Cressida Brown's imaginative production, teams of swimmers are marshalled to suggest arms and fins, ghosts and flesh; strange watery projections can be glimpsed like drowning dreams. A layer of myth is added with Gloria Onitiri's Arion, who stalks the playing space and sings like a dolphin. Lights flicker and short-circuit as if in contact with water. \"No non-swimmers beyond this point,\" says a notice as you enter the space. But it's well worth taking the plunge. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 January 2011. The original used the spelling Steve Walters.
