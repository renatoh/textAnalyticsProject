Instead of saying \u201clead us not into temptation\u201d, it will say \u201cdo not let us fall into temptation\u201d. The new wording was approved by the general assembly of the Episcopal Conference of Italy last month. It will appear in the third edition of the Messale Romano, the liturgical book that contains the guiding texts for mass in the Roman Catholic church. The pope said in 2017 he believed the wording should be altered. \u201cIt is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation,\u201d he told Italian TV. \u201cI am the one who falls. It\u2019s not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen. \u201cA father doesn\u2019t do that; a father helps you to get up immediately. It\u2019s Satan who leads us into temptation \u2013 that\u2019s his department.\u201d According to the Bible, Jesus taught the words to his disciples when they asked him how they should pray. Some have expressed concern about changes to the wording. Meredith Warren, a lecturer in biblical and religious studies at Sheffield University, said: \u201cThis new version of the Lord\u2019s Prayer tries to avoid implying that God has some hand in evil. \u201cBut in doing so the pope not only overlooks the many biblical examples where God works with the devil to tempt his followers and even his own son. The new version actually goes against the plain meaning of the Greek of the gospel text.\u201d After French bishops altered the words in 2017, Philip Lawler, the editor of Catholic World News, a conservative website, said the change was \u201cvery upsetting\u201d because the prayer was so deeply ingrained. \u201cPope Francis has made a habit of saying things that throw people into confusion, and this is one of them,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cIt just makes you wonder, where does it stop? What\u2019s up for grabs? It\u2019s cumulative unease.\u201d The Catholic church in England and Wales said it had no immediate plans to change the wording. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Prayer has been changed in the Italian language \u2013 there are no plans at present for it to change in English,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cEach language will be studied to see the specific meaning and understanding of the language. I am sure there will be some consultation with the English-speaking nations.\u201d Anglican worshippers can choose between traditional and contemporary versions of the prayer, but both include the words \u201clead us not into temptation\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
