Sanctions should not impede coronavirus fight Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, has said that sanctions should not stop the delivery of medical equipment and supplies to countries trying to contain the coronavirus outbreak. He made his comments in a declaration on Friday in which he also backed the UN\u2019s call for an immediate global ceasefire to allow the world to focus on the pandemic. \u201cThe European Union also stresses that sanctions should not impede the delivery of essential equipment and supplies necessary to fight the coronavirus and limit its spread worldwide,\u201d he said. He added the EU would apply humanitarian exceptions to ensure that sanctions would not hamper any efforts to fight the disease and encouraged \u201cother jurisdictions to provide the necessary clarifications to ensure that their respective sanctions are no obstacle to the global fight against the pandemic.\u201d China pauses to mourn patients and medical staff People across China paused for three minutes at 10am local time to remember the more than 3,000 patients and medical workers who have died during the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak.

Pakistan faces \u2018stark choice between outbreak and hunger\u2019 Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said the country faces some bleak choices. He tweeted: \u201cIn the subcontinent, with a high rate of poverty, we are faced with the stark choice of having to balance between a lockdown necessary to slow down/prevent the spread of Covid-19 and ensuring people don\u2019t die of hunger and our economy doesn\u2019t collapse. So we are walking a tightrope.\u201d UK lockdown could end in May if public sticks to distancing rules Neil Ferguson, a leading professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London said Britain would not be able to relax its stringent lockdown rules until May. He said the spread of coronavirus would have to slow down first and widespread testing would also have to be introduced. He said work was under way to establish how the rules could eventually be relaxed. \u201cWe want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May we are able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now,\u201d he said. Death toll in Iran Iran\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed to 3,452 on Saturday, with 158 fatalities recorded over the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said.
