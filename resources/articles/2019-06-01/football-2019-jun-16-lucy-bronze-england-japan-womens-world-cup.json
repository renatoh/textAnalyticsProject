Four years ago that is what the Lionesses felt in Canada when they lost to Japan in their World Cup semi-final. Except Lucy Bronze barely remembers the occasion because everything was \u201cblurry\u201d. For the first time in her career Bronze was so ill in Edmonton she had to be substituted. For a player who embodies her middle name Tough, the idea of being too sick to play was inconceivable. \u201cI was really ill that day in the semi-final \u2013 I don\u2019t remember a lot,\u201d she says as England prepare to face Japan again, in Wednesday\u2019s final group match. \u201cI was throwing up a lot. I was throwing up pretty much all day. I think it was food poisoning. That\u2019s why I was subbed. It was very blurry. It wasn\u2019t the sickness that stopped me, it was cramps. My body just went into shock.\u201d England\u2019s unexpected run to the semi-finals had captured the interest of many back home. BBC One recorded a late-night audience of 2.4 million. In the United States, 2.3 million tuned in \u2013 then a record for a game not involving the USA. Japan, the defending champions, went ahead through an Aya Miyama penalty. Fara Williams levelled from the spot but with the clock ticking towards extra time Laura Bassett diverted a cross on to the bar and into her own net. Some England players fell to their knees and a devastated Bassett could not be consoled by the embrace of her teammates on the final whistle. Wednesday\u2019s meeting with Japan is hardly of the same significance but England know that avoiding defeat would deliver top spot in Group D and present, in theory, a more straightforward passage to another semi-final. Reflecting on four years ago is a lot easier now for England\u2019s players, but if the pain has gone, the memory has not. \u201cIt\u2019s always in the back of your head,\u201d says Bronze, \u201cbut you do get over it. I think that\u2019s what the Germany game [in the third-place play-off] was for us back then. \u201cIt was putting Japan to bed and getting a bronze medal and getting back to winning, and reaching third place, which we had never done before in our history. We remember all the painful games. You remember all the big games that you\u2019ve lost but that memory has long been put behind us. We\u2019ve played Japan since then, beat them, and beat them well. We move on.\u201d Four years is a long time in women\u2019s football. The progression of the game in England has been huge, and it is notable that a peak TV audience of 5.4m watched Friday\u2019s win over Argentina. \u201cNow we are more prepared,\u201d Bronze says. \u201cWe have been to semi-finals. Back then it was so new to us \u2013 even getting to that semi-final was huge.\u201d March\u2019s SheBelieves Cup win against Japan, although a friendly and with neither side wanting to give too much away before the World Cup, has given the team confidence, says Bronze. \u201cThey did [have a changed side]. But at the same time we had a lot of inexperienced players. When I look back our midfield was very inexperienced. \u201cBeth Mead was quite inexperienced. Leah Williamson started that game. A lot of players who didn\u2019t have a lot of caps played in that game. We didn\u2019t have our strongest players out as well. We changed it and showed that we can still win. We were 3-0 up in the first half so we know they were missing players but we know we can do better than we did before.\u201d Bronze was one of the team in 2015; now the Lyon right-back is a leader. The Ballon d\u2019Or nominee and two-times Champions League-winner is a focal point of the team and, despite preferring to shy away from the spotlight, she has embraced the role her talent has thrust upon her. Keeping her fit and well throughout the World Cup will be vital to England. The severe sickness that crippled her 2015 campaign is long in the past. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was that I ate. I\u2019ve never had it before and I\u2019ve never had it since. \u201cWe went back to the same stadium to play the third- and fourth-placed play-off game and my sick was still there,\u201d she says with a big grin. \u201cI turned around on the bench and it was still there. I was sick on the bench at half-time, before the game and when I came off.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
