Karen Elson walked down a red rug in her hallway; Lara Stone modelled a tomato red jumpsuit in front of a sofa. Eva Herzigov\u00e1 stalked down a corridor wearing a black lace gown and top hat. Halima Aden filmed herself \u201ccatwalking\u201d on her balcony. Joan Smalls posed in her sun-drenched back yard in Puerto Rico. Karlie Kloss, Ashley Graham and Alessandra Ambr\u00f3sio also took part. The 30-minute \u2018Fashion Unites\u2019 event was organised by CR Runway, the organisation run by the former French Vogue editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld, and Aids charity Amfar, to raise money for its newly launched Covid-19 fund. Despite its lo-fi feel \u2013 and with the inevitable lockdown cameos from dogs and babies, and glimpses of bookshelves and soft furnishings \u2013 the event took a month, and a team of 60, to organise, Roitfeld said. \u201cCasting was a long process,\u201d she said, with models\u2019 bookers working from home in several different countries. And with everyone in lockdown, videos were required to help the models prep. The make-up artist Tom Pecheux created a video explaining \u201cthat the make-up was to be more of a smoky black eye,\u201d said Roitfeld. Another by the hairdresser Sam McKnight talked them through the required \u201cdo\u201d. \u201cNail direction\u201d came from Mei Kawajiri, who instructed them to \u201cdo a nice transparent colour and write \u2018Carine\u2019 in eyeliner on one of your nails\u201d. The choreographer Stephen Galloway instructed them remotely on their walks. The music was important. \u201cWe sent them music beforehand to give good energy to walk \u2013 the energy is amazing,\u201d said Roitfeld. The results, she added, \u201cwere quite beautiful. These models know how to do their make-up and hair better than you or I.\u201d Models wore clothes from their own wardrobes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t send anything to them,\u201d Roitfeld explained. \u201cWhich was a challenge for me, \u2018a control freak\u2019. But we just said: \u2018Wear something that makes you feel good. If you want to be evening, be evening, or you can be in your joggings.\u2019\u201d The fashion industry has been upended by the Covid-19 crisis, with the crew of photo shoots and catwalk shoots particularly impacted, often unable to work remotely. Fashion shows, with their huge backstage teams and audiences of hundreds sitting shoulder to shoulder, look unlikely to return for many months. The event was conceived to replace a real-life CR Runway fashion show. \u201cUnfortunately so many cannot work, and it\u2019s going to be a big problem,\u201d Roitfeld said. \u201cBut the show must go on and even if it\u2019s tough we have to do something. \u201cEveryone is going to have to become creative. We are going to have better times but it will never be like before. It will be a totally different world, not just for fashion but in general.\u201d Other big names appeared during the show to give what Roitfeld described as \u201cmessages of love and support\u201d. Kim Kardashian West was among those popping up, as well as designers including Off-White\u2019s Virgil Abloh, Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg and Alexander Wang. Not only is the fashion industry struggling logistically and economically, but it is also recalibrating tonally as recession looms. This event, said Roitfeld, \u201cmight make fashion more approachable, because not all of the girls are living in some huge villa in Beverley Hills, some of them don\u2019t have big apartments. It makes them more approachable. It\u2019s more human in a way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
