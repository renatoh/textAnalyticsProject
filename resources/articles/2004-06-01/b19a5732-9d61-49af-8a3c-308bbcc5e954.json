Now, though, the simmering dispute has erupted into an intellectual bunfight not seen since the rift between the discipline's founding father Sigmund Freud and his protege Carl Jung, resulting in calls for the government to regulate the previously unchecked profession of the unconscious. What has provoked the latest row is the setting up in London of a new organisation, the College of Psychoanalysts, which claims to be a \"professional body for psychoanalytic practitioners\" in the UK. But its website address, psychoanalysts.org.uk, is just one slip of a letter away from that of the British Psychoanalytical Society, psychoanalysis.org.uk - a move that has infuriated professional psychoanalysts. The BPAS has distanced itself from the college, putting a disclaimer on its own website suggesting that members of the new college are passing \"themselves off to the public as though they were trained psychoanalysts\". The crux of the BPAS argument is that a \"true\" psychoanalyst is someone who has undergone a rigorous training that includes intensive analysis of their own with a training analyst who is a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association, a society founded by Freud. It is worried, it says, because there has been an increase in the number of people pretending to be trained psychoanalysts in the UK. The society believes that because psychoanalysis involves a long-term intimate relationship with possibly fragile patients, people could be at risk if they are treated by practitioners who are not fully trained. But many outside the society argue that it is elitist, intellectually snobbish and financially motivated in its endeavours to preserve a hierarchy and limit the number of people laying claim to the cachet title of psychoanalyst. The problem is that in Britain, anyone who wants to can call themselves a psychoanalyst since it is an entirely unregulated business. In what it says is an attempt to stop charlatans setting themselves up and treating patients, the BPAS argues that only its members are the real psychoanalysts in the tradition of Freud. But this infuriates high-profile psychotherapists such as Susie Orbach, the author of Fat is a Feminist Issue, who says that only in Britain is she questioned over her right to call herself a psychoanalyst. \"It's only in Britain that this is an issue and it's to do with a class-based society and elitism,\" she said. \"Psychoanalysis is a very rich discipline. On principle I don't think that anybody can claim copyright on an idea or a term. It stifles development. I find these distinctions rather offensive. We want to push the field forward.\" The founder of the College of Psychoanalysts, Jacques China, who has a clinical doctorate in psychology from University College London and is organiser for the MA in clinical psychoanalysis at the University of Hertfordshire, says it is a \"pluralistic organisation that could encompass psychoanlaysts of all persuasions\". \"Psychoanalysis has always been contentious and there have been many different trainings,\" he said. \"It's been a myth for a very long time that there is only one training. \"In a letter Freud wrote to his contemporary [Georg] Groddeck, when the latter expressed reluctance to call himself a psychoanalyst, Freud stated 'anyone who has recognised transference and resistance as the focal points of therapy belongs irretrievably to the mad horde ... ' \"Freud was, of course, referring here to the community of psychoanalysts. In his writing over many years he used the term 'psychoanalyst' interchangeably with the term 'therapist'.\" Dr China says the founding of the college has caused so many ripples because it is the first time the word psychoanalyst has been used in the title of an organisation, as opposed to psychoanalysis. But the college has provoked concern from the British Confederation of Psychotherapists, a wider body of psychoanalytic therapists to which the BPAS is affiliated. It wrote a letter to all its members warning them that if they joined the college it would preclude them from membership of the BCP. Ron Britton, the president of the BPAS, said: \"People were probably concerned because this so-called college founded a website which sounded so much like our own. \"I think we probably overreacted with the disclaimer, thinking people would probably mistake the college for us.\" Dr Britton says there is a need for clarity and argues that the society is not trying to keep people out. He is defiant that the issue is not about money and preserving wealthy clients for society members, since seeing patients five times a week often means they agree to charge less. \"One can't earn as much as a full-time analyst as a consultant psychotherapist on the NHS,\" he said. Robert Maxwell Young, a psychoanalytic psychotherapist, argues that there is a caste system within the profession. \"It doesn't matter how well policed you are or how well regarded, if you live in a subculture that has castes it can get under your skin. Being a counsellor or a psychotherapist is a perfectly honourable thing to do. But they peck at each other and it's a serious pity,\" he said. The solution, says Peter Fonagy, Freud memorial professor at University College London, is for the government to intercede and introduce some clarity. \"I do believe regulation is enormously important for the entire psychotherapy profession,\" he said. \"Part of that is clarity over what people practice. I do not have strong feelings that psychoanalysts should belong to any one institution ... I do have strong feelings that the public has the right to know what training and what qualifications the person they have approached to help them in their vulnerable state has.\" Ever since Freud invented psychoanalysis it has been a discipline with enough factions to fill a Monty Python sketch. Dr China says the college is simply an attempt to bring the factions together: \"Psychoanalysis in this country has been riven ever since it began. \"This was a missed opportunity for reconciliation.\" Differet factions \u00b7 Clinical psychologists have studied psychology at university and undergone further training. They cannot prescribe drugs \u00b7 Psychiatrists are doctors who have done specialist training; they treat people with disorders of the mind. They may use drugs and/or psychological \"talking\" treatments \u00b7 Psychotherapy is a generic term for all talking treatments. It may be practised by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists or other specifically trained psychotherapists \u00b7 Psychoanalysis is one of the original forms of psychotherapy, with patients visiting the analyst five times a week \u00b7 Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is a less intensive form of psychoanalysis with patients visiting fewer times a week"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
