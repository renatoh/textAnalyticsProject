But that is not the case with Jonjo O'Neill, whose horses have produced their form time and again at the Grand National meeting. Twelve winners from 60 runners here over the past five years, yielding a level-stakes profit of more than 60 points, makes O'Neill the trainer to follow. Those figures also provide encouragement for the wellbeing of Exotic Dancer when he bids to step up on last month's Gold Cup second in today's Betfair Bowl. Seventeen of the last 23 winners of this Grade 2 chase had taken part in the Gold Cup and Exotic Dancer (2.35) would have been a clear winner of the Cheltenham showpiece but for the presence of the brilliant Kauto Star. O'Neill's seven-year-old could not cope with the season's unbeaten superstar but maintained his own progressive profile by staying on all the way to the line. Turpin Green also deserves credit for finishing third but even a 4lb pull with Exotic Dancer today may not be enough to reverse the placings. More troublesome might be the Gold Cup sixth, State Of Play, who had not run since November. State Of Play whizzed round the bends of the Mildmay course when beating Lacdoudal by 16 lengths here last year. Nevertheless, it is slightly surprising to see him as close to Exotic Dancer in the bookies' early betting. He is 11-4, with Exotic Dancer a tempting 2-1. I would say there is more between them than that. My Will, normally a model of consistency, ran no sort of race in the Gold Cup. Our Vic was back on song at the Festival, finishing an unlucky second to Taranis. He comes here in better form than when pulled up behind Grey Abbey two years ago and this less demanding test of stamina may enable Our Vic to reduce the yawning gap which Exotic Dancer opened up on him at Cheltenham in January. Black Jack Ketchum was on the mark for O'Neill at last year's meeting but the eight-year-old has questions to answer in the John Smith's Liverpool Hurdle. In truth, his winning form over three miles as a novice last season was nothing to write home about. Inglis Drever and Mighty Man (2.00) had a tremendous scrap in the Ladbrokes World Hurdle, where Black Jack Ketchum crashed out at the third flight. Henry Daly's seven-year-old is two out of two at Aintree and can come out on top this time. O'Neill seemed quietly surprised by the victory of Drombeag (3.45) in the Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham but his nine-year-old looked good value for his narrow win over Whyso Mayo and he can become the first horse since Double Silk in 1993 to follow up in today's Fox Hunters' Chase, which is run over the Grand National fences. In touch when he fell five-out in this race a year ago, having earlier tried to run out, Drombeag looked happier in cheekpieces at Cheltenham compared with the blinkers he wore a year ago. Scots Grey impressed at Newbury but he may not be at his best over these obstacles. Detroit City followed up his Triumph Hurdle victory in the John Smith's Anniversary Hurdle a year ago and Katchit (3.10) looks set to pull off the same double. In the past, Cheltenham winners were saddled with a penalty here but they are on a level playing field now that the race has Grade One status. Unless Katchit has gone backwards since Cheltenham - and yesterday Alan King, his trainer, said he \"couldn't be more pleased with the horse\" - it will take something special to lower the colours of the nine-lengths Festival winner. Liberate (4.55), the four-year-old who chased Katchit home up the Cheltenham hill, can account for older novice rivals in the Citroen C4 Mersey Hurdle. Today's extra half-mile should be to his liking. Novice chasers have won eight of the last 12 runnings of the Red Rum Handicap, which is a strong pointer towards Ferdy Murphy's lightly-weighted Marshall Hall (4.20). Each-way backers should consider Dusky Warbler (5.30), who has some good track form to his name and hails from in the in-form Gary Moore stable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
