The 22-year-old French striker moved to from Arsenal to Glasgow on loan at the start of July but less than two months later he has decided to return south after failing to start a competitive game. \"I am very disappointed this has not worked out the way I thought it would,\" said Aliadi\u00e8re. Celtic's chairman Brian Quinn insists the board will give Gordon Strachan time - providing supporters show the same patience. Since replacing Martin O'Neill, the former Southampton and Coventry manager has endured a difficult introduction to life in charge at Celtic Park. Quinn and his fellow directors are sympathetic to the fact that Strachan has had to overhaul the Celtic squad since his arrival. Despite going out of Europe and losing the first Old Firm derby of the season at Ibrox on Saturday, Quinn has pledged his support to Strachan. \"We are delighted Gordon Strachan has joined us. He is a serious person, he is committed to doing the best he can for Celtic and he needs the support of the fans,\" he said. \"He needs to have the fans behind him through this period of change. I will understand if they get disappointed by results such as the one against Rangers but they have to give him support. If they get behind him, he's got a better chance.\" Strachan has also been hit by a number of injuries and will be without his suspended captain Neil Lennon and Alan Thompson for the match at Dunfermline on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
