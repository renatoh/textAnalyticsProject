The Ghana striker, 23, flew into the UK on Friday to discuss personal terms after Villa submitted a bid of around \u00a39m for a player who scored 12 goals in Ligue 1 last season. Swansea, whom Ayew\u2019s brother Andre joined earlier in the summer from Marseille, are also understood to have shown an interest but the second oldest son of the Ghana legend Abedi Pele appears set on a move to the Midlands. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to have arrived in the UK and to have the opportunity to join a club the size of Aston Villa,\u201d Ayew told Sky Sports News. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting the manager and I am very excited about the prospect of playing in the best league in the world. \u201cI\u2019m sure with the new players that Aston Villa are bringing in that we can all work together to make it a great season for a great football club.\u201d Ayew\u2019s agent, Mark McKay, confirmed earlier that Villa had submitted a bid for Ayew. \u201cVilla have made an offer for Jordan Ayew to Alex Hayes, the vice-president of Lorient,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hoping Jordan will be allowed to travel from Lorient to Birmingham tonight to discuss personal terms. Tim Sherwood is an admirer of Jordan and feels he could be a big success in the Premier League.\u201d Villa have already seen their club captain, Fabian Delph, join Manchester City this summer while the Holland defender Ron Vlaar declined the club\u2019s offer of a new contract. Benteke\u2019s departure means Gabby Agbonlahor, Libor Kozak and Callum Robinson are the only strikers at the club with first-team experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
