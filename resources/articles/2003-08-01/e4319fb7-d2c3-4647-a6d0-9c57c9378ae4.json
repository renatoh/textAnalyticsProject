No, not the NHS. As any avid tabloid reader knows, the NHS is now a \"third world\" service and the one to which we should all aspire instead is France's. But with up to 10,000 dead in France due to the August heatwave, President Jacques Chirac has suddenly had to promise reform of his country's health service. And the prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, hastily assembled an almost Blairite-sounding \"plan blanc\" to open more beds and mobilise extra staff. French health minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mattei may yet be forced to resign; his surgeon-general has already done so. As Paris mortuaries have overflowed, bodies have had to be stored in refrigerated lorries. When that happened in the NHS during a so-called \"winter crisis\", it precipitated bouts of moral outrage in the media. Yet mere months ago, screeds of uncritical coverage about the French system accompanied the first patients from NHS waiting lists to be treated there under contract. Reporters marvelled at the plush, unhurried atmosphere of the wards and salivated at the haute cuisine which French hospital patients took for granted. British holidaymakers, unlucky enough to suffer minor illness or injury while across the Channel, were canvassed for their opinions, and readily attested to unfailingly courteous service, leisurely hospital stays and armfuls of medication. Former French health minister Bernard Kouchner described NHS waiting lists as \"medieval\", and French doctors were aghast at how Britain has struggled to cope with winter flu epidemics. In short, France well deserved the first place awarded by the World Health Organisation when it ranked its 191 member states' health services, and no one should have been surprised that the hapless, hopeless NHS merited only a humble 18th. Proposals for sweeping it away and replacing it with social insurance modelled on the French system sprouted from right-wing think-tanks, and the shadow health secretary, Liam Fox, flirted with the idea in conference speeches. Now the tables are turned. The office for national statistics estimates that here 900 may have died because of the heat, which was only slightly less intense than in France - where far hotter summers than Britain's are normal. The Department of Health says no hospital accident and emergency department has reported being unable to cope with increased demand due to the heat. In truth, the fault lines in the French health service were apparent to anyone who cared to look closely enough. New year's day dawned with more than half the country's obstetricians on strike over rising insurance premiums. Twelve months earlier, 80% of French doctors, as well as dentists, ambulance staff and pharmacists, staged a 24-hour strike for more pay. The French system suffers chronic waste and inefficiency. Overprescription is rife, while excessive numbers of hospital beds encourage languid lengths of stay - not always good for speedy recovery or consistent with modern medical practice. Bureaucratic billing and payments have created a system that is slow and sluggish to react in an emergency - hence the turmoil this summer. Since French patients can bypass GPs and refer themselves to specialists - sometimes unnecessarily - it is costly too. The service is currently facing a \u00a37bn deficit, and before the summer crisis the government was contemplating cutting services for elderly people. That is hardly an option now. French ministers might instead - whisper who dares - look to the NHS for useful lessons. So might German ones, whose system was also lauded in the popular press at the NHS's expense but who are now also locked in torrid debate about reform and rationing services, especially for elderly people. The NHS was forced to confront many of the issues now dogging European health systems long ago. It may not have fully resolved all of them - no one has - but it is further along the road and in better shape to do so than most of its neighbours. We should not forget that by their standards it is a miracle of efficiency, achieving broadly similar health outcomes for far less expenditure. And the moral of this tale? Health stories make good, dramatic copy for the popular press; complex underlying policy issues don't. But without the second, the glib implications in the first may be seriously misleading.
