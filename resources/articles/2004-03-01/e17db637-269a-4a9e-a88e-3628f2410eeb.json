The committee, which Bates chairs, had previously rebuffed an application from the FA executive to introduce the mid-season break. After yesterday's full vote, however, it appears that the radical policies of the England coach have gained favour with the rank and file of the FA, who referred the proposal back to Bates's committee for reconsideration. \"There have been many meetings with committees and last week the FA Cup committee voted against it,\" Eriksson said yesterday. \"But today the FA council have been very supportive of it and I hope it will come true.\" The Swede received overwhelming support from the clubs after presenting the case to a meeting of Premier League chairmen in January, and hoped to gain further backing for the resolution from the Challenge Cup committee last week. However, in spite of another personal appeal, his attempt was rebuffed by a five-three vote by the committee, with Bates and his committee rejecting one member's suggestion that there should be another debate on the proposal. Had the decision not been taken by full council yesterday, FA statutes would have ruled out the winter break being debated again for the next 12 months. Tottenham are considering a summer move for Feyenoord's Robin van Persie, having refused to talk with Christian Ziege about a new contract until the end of the season. The Dutchman is a left-sided midfield player and would be the natural successor to Ziege. Spurs have twice sent scouts to watch him. Nicolas Anelka, who has refused to play for France for the past 16 months, last night apologised to the national coach Jacques Santini. The Manchester City striker declined a late call-up to the squad for a game against Yugoslavia in November 2002. He said: \"It seems necessary for me to make a public apology to M. Jacques Santini and a public apology to the French national team. This apology has the merit of setting me free mentally because I no longer recognised myself in the public row which followed my refusal to play for France.\" Sheffield United have signed the Bradford City defender Simon Francis for an initial \u00a3200,000, rising to \u00a3250,000 if the Blades win promotion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
