Anthony Martial spent quite a lot of Saturday afternoon drifting on the wing at Selhurst Park, on the periphery, generally well marked and marshalled and deprived of inviting spaces and clever passes to attack. He looked, perhaps understandably, a little flat. Meanwhile Wayne Rooney chugged along at centre forward without making inroads either. Eventually they switched positions, but by then the tone of this blunt game was pretty well set. Alan Pardew was reluctant to get too involved in the analysis of United\u2019s current attacking concept, but in outlining how Crystal Palace set about their preparations for this game, he shone a fascinating light on the Rooney-Martial conundrum. Louis van Gaal continues to prefer the United captain up front, with the French teenager back in the position where he spent most of his apprenticeship in France after such an eventful opening salvo as the centrepiece of United\u2019s frontline. But Pardew was clear about the danger Palace were most concerned about. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give Martial an inch today,\u201d assessed the Palace manager. \u201cNot an inch. It was a big target for us to stop him and we felt if we could stop him, we could stop their creative angle. When you take into account his age, that\u2019s some recommendation, by the way. Our analysis is much greater than it has ever been. Our information is much greater so to protect ourselves against the top players, we have greater awareness. \u201cI have to say he is an impressive young player. I think he handled himself very well because he would have felt our presence around him and still he had moments in the game. The Man United manager will have to be very, very careful I think to keep his exuberance there because we were looking to stop him, I make no bones about that.\u201d It all seemed to add to the case for Martial to be given more game time in the middle. Without much in the way of goal action to talk about, the debate about Manchester United\u2019s possession style under Van Gaal won\u2019t go away. It was telling that the thirst for goals seemed far more intense in the stands than on the pitch, where the away support showed their agitation over the absence of the sparky gusto that used to characterise United when they were in need of goals. A sequence of nil-nil draws niggles, and Van Gaal felt the need only to look forward. He is hoping United\u2019s meeting with CSKA Moscow will allow his team to rediscover some potency. United\u2019s last goal, incidentally, came in the away game in Russia via Martial\u2019s header. Palace\u2019s Yohan Cabaye, fresh from spending a couple of weeks with Martial on duty with the French national team, has seen enough to feel certain the 19-year-old has everything to be \u201ca special player\u201d. Where, though, might he be most special? \u201cFor me he could be excellent in the Premier League as a centre-forward or on the wing.\u201d Cabaye articulated a view that would perhaps resonate with United fans who chanted for their team to \u201cattack, attack, attack\u201d. The Palace captain felt their gameplan was less dangerous than the United of old. \u201cI remember I played against them for Newcastle and they could score at every moment in a game. Here they did not have the big chances to score. Passes, passes, passes. But if you work hard against them and stay in a good shape they can\u2019t do anything to pass through you or be adventurous.\u201d United\u2019s players are hoping the spark will come back soon enough, sending the message that a moment to regroup after a sobering 3-0 defeat at Arsenal is a natural part of the process. Get solid first, add the flair next. \u201cWe have the players to score goals and we will score goals,\u201d said Morgan Schneiderlin. \u201cIt will come if we keep believing. After the Arsenal game, we\u2019ve shown good character and spirit. We want to win the title so, to win games, we need to score goals. It\u2019s still early as we head into November so there are a lot of games to be played. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are second, third, fourth or fifth in November. What matters is to be first at the end of May and win the games. \u201cEvery team is going to go through a period where they don\u2019t score goals and are going to be unlucky. It will happen to the teams in front of us for sure. It\u2019s up to us to win games and overtake those teams.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
