Eddie Murphy being James Brown\u2019", "bodyText": "The funniest standup I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 The first time I laughed and couldn\u2019t breathe was Katt Williams\u2019s Pimp Chronicles. The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 Eddie Murphy on SNL being James Brown in \u201cToo hot for the hot tub\u201d. The accuracy in his impression and the silliness of watching somebody tiptoe round a Jacuzzi in James Brown fashion killed me. The funniest book I\u2019ve ever read \u2026 They have funny books? That make you laugh? Seriously? The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 Watching angry people fall on ice they didn\u2019t see. The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned \u2026 My rap name was Chief and so I had a belt buckle that had \u201cChief\u201d on it. Yes, it was as bad as it sounds. And the letters were loose; you could hear them struggling to stay a part of the belt. The funniest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten \u2026 The burger I had when my cousin got a spanking. He wouldn\u2019t finish his food, and couldn\u2019t leave the table until he did, and was crying \u2013 and at one point said: \u201cI can\u2019t eat this. It has too many tears on it. It\u2019s salty.\u201d The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 Man, maybe the hi-top fade I had. I looked like Hey Arnold\u2019s best friend. But now, the funniest hairstyle would be weeks from now if I stopped caring because the hair in the middle of my head quits coming to work after a while. Chris Redd plays Soho Theatre, W1, Monday 10 to 15 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
