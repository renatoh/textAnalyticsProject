It is a truism among oceanographers that scientists know more about the topography of Mars, or the dark side of the moon, than about the surface of most of the earth, but that doesn't make it any less true. Forget for the moment the polluting discharges from Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico and other gushers, spills and seepages, and think of the lesson from a new exhibition, The Deep, which has just opened at the Natural History Museum. The oceans cover 70% of the globe. But whereas life is smeared thinly across the continents \u2013 mostly in the space bounded by the forest canopy and a tree's roots \u2013 all of the ocean is habitable, and inhabited, from the shallows of the intertidal zones to the crushing depths of the abyssal plain. So the sea provides 99% of the planet's living space. The ocean is home to the longest mountain chain of all, the 65,000 kilometre (40,000 mile) mid-ocean ridge, and to the deepest chasms, such as the Kermadec trench, reaching more than 10,000 metres (35,000 feet) below the waves. It is the biochemical retort in which life first emerged more than 3.5 billion years ago, and for at least the first 3 billion years it was life's only home. It distributes the planet's heat, conditions its atmosphere and controls its plumbing: each year more than a metre of the ocean surface evaporates to form the clouds that deliver the rains that feed the world's rivers, lakes, aquifers and glaciers. The first great scientific probe of the oceans dates only from the late 19th century. HMS Challenger's discoveries were eye-opening, but one premise of the science that followed was wrong. Geologists and oceanographers alike assumed \u2013 because the continents sat on the ocean basalt \u2013 that the ocean floor must contain the planet's oldest rocks. British scientists in 1963 demonstrated that the ocean rocks must be among the youngest on the planet, continuously renewed at the ocean ridges, destroyed at the continental margins, the new growth propelling the continents around the globe like spume on the tide. Only later, with the advance of deep sea submersibles, did marine scientists begin to realise that many of their other assumptions had been wrong. The abyssal plain was not a muddy, lifeless desert. It proved to be home to an astonishing range of creatures, some beautifully adapted to the superheated brines of submarine volcanoes, some to the near-freezing darkness of cold-water corals miles below the surface. But the exploration of this unknown world is costly, faltering and barely begun. We still know little about the planet's single greatest feature. All we do know is that we have begun to devastate it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
