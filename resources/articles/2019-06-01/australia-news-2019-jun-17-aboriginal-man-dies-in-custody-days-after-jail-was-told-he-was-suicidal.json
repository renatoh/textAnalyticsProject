The WA Department of Justice confirmed that on Wednesday last week \u201ca 30-year-old male prisoner was found alone and unresponsive in his cell at Acacia prison. Efforts by medical and custodial officers to revive the man were unsuccessful.\u201d The Corrective Services commissioner, Tony Hassall, has offered his condolences to the man\u2019s family. The death is being treated as a death in custody and WA police are investigating and preparing a report for the coroner. According to Mervyn Eades of Ngalla Maya, a Noongar not-for-profit company that supports Indigenous prisoners and their families, the man in Acacia had been \u201chaving a hard time, had been in some fights, and had been seen with severe bruising\u201d. \u201cHe called out for help,\u201d Eades said. \u201cHe called his mum and told her he was going to kill himself. She called the prison and told them. She went to visit but he wouldn\u2019t come out to see her.\u201d Ngalla Maya was calling for the WA government to appoint an Indigenous justice commissioner to \u201coversee all these deaths in custody, look at recommendation after recommendation\u201d, Eades said. \u201cNothing\u2019s being done. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 46 [Indigenous] people die in 10 years in WA,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone needs to be held accountable. \u201cThe system has failed another one of our young men. The medical attention they need is just not there. The mental health support they need is just not there.\u201d The Department of Justice said it was conducting an internal review into the circumstances surrounding the man\u2019s death. \u201cAs a result of these ongoing investigations, there will be no further comment at this time,\u201d it said.
