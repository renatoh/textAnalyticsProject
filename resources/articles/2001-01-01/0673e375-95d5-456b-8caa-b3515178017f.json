Fifa and Uefa last night finalised joint proposals calling for players to honour contracts for a minimum of three years and for a compensation system that would value players according to their commercial worth to a club as well as time spent on training, level of salary and other input into a player's development. Chelsea are keen to take the 22-year-old defender Philippe Christanval from Monaco as part of the deal that would see Frank Leboeuf return to his homeland, according to reports in France. Chelsea have said Leboeuf can leave if Monaco meet their asking price, believed to be \u00a33m, and Leboeuf has confirmed that his career at Stamford Bridge is over. \"I do not have a future here and it is time to move on,\" he said. \"I want to go to Monaco and I hope a deal can be made between the two clubs. I do not want to stay at Chelsea if I'm not playing. I think I might have played my last game for the club.\" Arsenal should escape expulsion from the FA Cup or losing Premier League points even if their Lithuanian striker Tomas Danilevicius is expelled from Britain for allegedly carrying a false passport. A Football Association spokesman said that Arsenal could only be punished if it was proven they knew Danilevicius had entered the country on a false Greek passport after signing from FC Lausanne of Switzerland for an undisclosed fee. \"But at the moment it's all hypothetical,\" he said. Danilevicius has played three games as a substitute for Arsenal since joining in December. Tottenham have admitted an interest in Southampton's Morocco striker Hassan Kachloul, who is stalling over a new contract at the Dell. Newcastle's goalkeeper Shay Given has withdrawn his transfer request, and Aston Villa's goalkeeper David James has agreed a new 3-year contract, 12 months longer than his current deal. James's agent Colin Gordon said: \"We shook hands on the deal last night. There are a few more technicalities to be tied up but nothing that will stop it going through. \"He has been very impressed with Juan Pablo Angel since he arrived and feels he can achieve the things he wants to in the game with Villa.\" Villa announced a loss before tax of \u00a32.6m for the six months up to November 30 last year. The Leeds manager David O'Leary has said that Rio Ferdinand's chances of playing in the Premiership game at Villa tonight are not as remote as first thought. Ferdinand looked likely to miss the game after straining tendons behind his knee while watching television. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
