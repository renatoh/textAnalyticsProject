'We've found you a club.' The head of the GWR independent radio group was intrigued. 'Which one?' 'Orient or something. Do you want me send you the details?' came the response. After an anguished pause, in which he had to wrestle with his conscience, Bernard, an East End boy and lifelong Leyton Orient fan, agreed. It is one of the strangest media tales never told. The time, long, long ago - way before Sky tried to bag Manchester United - when Britain's largest radio company took the quixotic decision to buy a football club. In the end it never happened. Bernard studied the club's books and tried numerous ways to make the deal pay but eventually balked at the price. Just as well considering the club's lamentable fortunes on and off the pitch in the years that followed. Today the deal sounds crazy. But back in the Eighties there was some method in Bernard's madness. The UK's radio sector was so heavily regulated (even more than during the Nineties) that GWR could not see how it could expand. Hemmed in on all sides, the company decided to widen its leisure remit and hit on the novel idea of buying a football club. How times have changed. Last week, after years of lobbying, the radio sector has been dealt some blessed relief in the shape of the deregulatory Communications Bill. Archaic laws restricting ownership will be greatly relaxed, a move which will stimulate consolidation in the radio industry - the most fragmented sector in UK media. The announcement of the Bill went some way to lifting the gloom at GWR's Oxford Street headquarters which also doubles as the studios for Classic FM, the company's flagship station. Last week GWR, which in addition to Classic owns 32 local stations, 16 digital licences and has a smattering of interests across Europe and elsewhere, posted interim profits of \u00a32.2 million, down 20 per cent on the back of flat revenues of just over \u00a362m. Inevitably GWR's shares dropped on the news, chiefly because of the company's gloomy prognosis about the state of the advertising market. But it was possible they could have fallen further if it hadn't been for the stabilising effect of the Communications Bill. Nevertheless, GWR's shares stand at around 160p, compared with almost 800p a couple of years ago. The Bill - announced last Wednesday - contained little in the way of surprises for Bernard : 'It's such an anti-climax after all the lobbying.' Despite the glacial pace at which the Bill has progressed, Bernard has praise for Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell - 'She delivered, she listened to our arguments' - but he would have liked the Bill to have gone further by stipulating that the BBC should be governed by Ofcom. The BBC is a pet topic for Bernard. Radio 1 gets short shrift, although he believes its renewed focus on a younger, largely teenage, audience means its share of the licence fee can now be justified. Not so Radio 2 with its increasing focus on youngish adults. 'They're covering a section of the audience which is well catered for. A lot of the old Radio 2 audience [those in their seventies and eighties] have effectively been disenfranchised. Where do they go now?' Some have probably gone to Classic FM, which was Bernard's baby and was launched in 1991. A huge success, it was nevertheless almost stillborn. Presentations were made to more than 100 UK financial institutions including the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail and the London Evening Standard, but hardly any wanted to stump up cash to help GWR launch the station. It was only when Time Warner offered to take a 30 per cent stake that Classic became a reality. Today DMGT owns just under 30 per cent of GWR and there is widespread speculation that it will consider buying GWR once cross-media ownership laws are relaxed. Bernard says he's relaxed about this. 'They're entirely supportive. In every area we've expanded into, they've supported us. They like radio.' True, but whether they would be interested in GWR's network of local radio stations remains open to question. There are obvious overlaps between Classic listeners and Mail readers, but what would happen to the rest of GWR's empire is less clear. Perhaps it might fall to any number of US media conglomerates, licking their lips at the prospect of UK acquisitions. Bernard says it is inevitable that the likes of Clear Channel have been running the slide rule over GWR, but he doesn't believe consolidation will be short term because (in this post-bubble environment) 'people's valuations vary so much', and besides, the Yanks 'are a lot more cautious than people believe'. However, he concedes: 'It is unlikely that the shape of the industry today will be the same in three years time.' Despite the talk of US invaders Bernard believes that it will be domestic mergers that will drive consolidation. He points out that there are no fewer than 70 separate radio groups operating in the UK, suggesting the sector is ripe for consolidation. When this comes it will give a much needed boost to digital radio. For years the new medium has promised much and delivered little. The high price of sets and a BBC which has (until recently) been somewhat lukewarm in its enthusiasm for digital radio has failed to drive penetration, much to Bernard's chagrin. As possibly the UK's biggest advocate for digital (he is chairman of the Digital Radio Development Bureau) Bernard, a former local newspaper journalist, has tied GWR's future to the new medium's success. The company has even stumped up its own cash to produce a microchip, integral to the new sets, in a bid to stimulate mass production. Bernard has little time for digital nay sayers. He points out that sets have come down to \u00a399 and that next year Ford will start putting digital radios in its cars. 'In the UK now we've got 50 digital radio channels, in just two years. Just imagine what can be achieved in another two years. Anyone who doesn't believe in digital radio shouldn't be involved in radio.' This is a stark conclusion. But in years to come Bernard's shareholders will either regard him as a seer or someone who bet the farm and lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
