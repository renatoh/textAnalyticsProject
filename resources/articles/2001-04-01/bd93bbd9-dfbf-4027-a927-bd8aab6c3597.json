A late piece of Black magic earned a point for Palace after they had led for most of the game, but victories for Stockport, Grimsby and Huddersfield pushed them to the back of the field and into the relegation places. At least Palace extended their unbeaten run to three matches - they had lost the previous six - and their manager Alan Smith did not bear the countenance of someone sinking in the relegation mire. \"It was a pretty good performance,\" he said. \"We've taken four points off Watford this season. It just goes to show that there's a thin dividing line in the division.\" More pertinent is the thin dividing line towards the foot of the table that now separates Palace from Huddersfield, who have a game in hand. Smith has only six matches to prevent that slide into the Second Division. Not since Terry Venables dragged them out of the old Third in 1977 have they stooped so low. A fine finale will outshine memories of an otherwise turgid game here - even Watford's manager Graham Taylor was moved to call it \"crap\" - as each team lost their grip on three handy points. Palace took the lead with an early penalty: the leggy Ricardo Fuller gangled into the area and was brought down by Robert Page, who saw yellow before Dean Austin did the business from the spot. \"I couldn't see Watford scoring, but then you never know with a Graham Taylor side,\" said Smith ruefully later. Inside the last quarter-hour Allan Nielsen surprised him by heading home and then, two minutes later, Tommy Mooney hammered the ball beyond the leaping Aleksandrs Kolinko and was duly buried at the bottom of a seven-man pile as the play-offs hoved back into view. Yet Tommy Black obscured the vision by lashing a 20-yard shot through a thicket of players at the last and the hands-on-head exasperation switched back from south London to north."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
