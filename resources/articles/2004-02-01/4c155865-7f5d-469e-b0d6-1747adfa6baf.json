Six days after accusing some colleagues of \"slacking off,\" Keane revealed it had led to a number of training-ground confrontations and that he was going public with his views because \"with young players sometimes it goes in one ear and out the other\". The United captain stopped short of naming the players he had identified for the brunt of his criticism, but said there were some who had been playing first-team football for only a year and \"think they can live off last year's championship\". By that, John O'Shea and Kieran Richardson are immediately implicated, especially as both have struggled to replicate their form from last season. \"It's not just the last week or two but the last month or two,\" said Keane. \"I've said it to the players themselves but sometimes you need to say it publicly for them to take notice because some young players think they have done it in the game when they have done absolutely nothing.\" He blamed the attitudes of some colleagues for United's position, five points adrift of the Premiership leaders Arsenal. He believes they cannot afford to lose another match if they are to retain the title. \"A lot of players seem to think you can slack off in training and turn up at Old Trafford on Saturday as if you are switching on a light. Well, you can't. I'm concentrating more on what's been happening on the training pitch, what the public can't see and maybe one or two of the staff can't see. I'm in the middle of it so I can see it, and I don't like what I see sometimes. \"It needs to be said because there are players who have done that here who are gone now. I judge a good player on whether they have been doing it for eight, nine or 10 years, not one. And there are plenty who have had one good season, then disappeared because they think they have arrived.\" Keane went on to question the lifestyles of some United players. \"[They should] focus on what they're doing in training, in the gym, what they're eating, who they're hanging around with, whether they're resting enough. Manchester United should be 24 hours a day and nothing else should come into it. Unfortunately with younger players nowadays as soon as they've played 10 or 15 matches, all of sudden they get their decent contract, their agent, and they can slack off. They lose five per cent but that's enough because it's such a fine line between winning trophies and not.\" Of the title race, Keane said United had put themselves under \"intolerable pressure\" and \"given ourselves no room for error\". He said: \"Arsenal are in a fantastic position. We'll push them all the way but they are the favourites.\" Meanwhile, Keane hinted he might consider an international return if asked by the Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr. He has not played since falling out with Kerr's predecessor Mick McCarthy and retired. He told an Irish radio station that he \"missed international football\" and felt he had \"unfinished business\" with Ireland. He may be inviting Kerr to make a move ahead of the start of World Cup qualifying. He said: \"if I come back it would have to be just qualifying matches\" and added that might be \"unfair\" on Kerr and the team. Blasts from the past: November 2000 'Sometimes you wonder, do they understand football? They have a few drinks plus the prawn sandwiches and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch' On Man United's fans Sept 2001 'Contracts mean nothing. He has discovered that to clubs the players are just expensive pieces of meat' On Jaap Stam August 2002 'I'd waited long enough. I hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that. I didn't wait for Mr Elleray to show the card. I turned and walked to the dressing room' On Alfe Inge Haaland"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
