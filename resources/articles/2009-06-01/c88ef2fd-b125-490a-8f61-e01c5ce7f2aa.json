The players exchanged knowing glances. Despite their youth they know their football history. The ultimate psychological test had been set. On the German team coach, meanwhile, the players celebrated their semi-final victory over Italy later on Friday evening by blasting out Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. If the mood in the England camp was one of determination and quiet conviction, the German confidence was rather more boisterous. They are wary of England. They have to be after the manner in which they were outplayed by Stuart Pearce's second string in the final Group B tie between the teams last Monday. Already qualified for the knock-out phase, Pearce rested all his regulars and, although the match ended 1-1, which got both nations through, England's ascendancy was startling. Pearce's team, however, then wobbled alarmingly against Sweden, throwing away a 3-0 lead before edging home on penalties, whereas Germany looked more imposing the longer their game against Italy went on. Germany are the current European Under-17 and Under-19 champions and they are past masters of growing into tournaments. They treat finals as their birthright. Despite England having convinced most neutrals that they have the best squad, the Germans feel that momentum is with them. \"No team is considered a favourite in a final but I am convinced that we are going to win,\" said Horst Hrubesch, the Germany manager, whose relaxed demeanour at the pre-match press conference contrasted with Pearce's 100-yard stare. \"We have bitten ourselves into the tournament,\" Hrubesch continued, \"and we go into this game with great expectations. You do not have to be worried about penalties either because the game will be decided in the 90 minutes. In Germany's favour, for sure.\" Those in search of portents wondered why Germany, as the nominated \"home\" team, had chosen to wear red rather than their normal white shirts. The decision was made late on Saturday, meaning an after-hours shift for Pearce's kit man who, like the rest of the squad, had expected England to be in red, as they famously were in the 1966 World Cup final victory over West Germany. Was this some dastardly ploy to steal a psychological advantage? England, though, are confident they will triumph in whatever colour. Pearce has accentuated the positives of the win over Sweden, in particular the breakthrough penalty success, and there is the feeling inside the dressing room that they are fated to triumph. \"When we were on the coach and we got the news that we were going to play Germany, it seemed like it was meant to be,\" said the captain, Mark Noble. \"We're all English players and, when you get brought through the ranks from the Under-16s to the Under-21s and the senior team, whenever you play Germany, it is always a massive game. Even though it is an Under-21 championship final, there is no doubt there will be that extra little incentive because it is Germany. \"We've played them once before in the tournament and dominated them in many spells. If we can do that again, I'm sure we can lift the trophy.\" Pearce, as ever, kept his cards glued to his chest yesterday, even going so far as to ask, \"Who has told you Theo Walcott will play?\" But with Gabriel Agbonlahor and Fraizer Campbell, the only recognised strikers in the squad, ruled out through suspension, together with the goalkeeper, Joe Hart \u2013 whose appeal against his booking in the semi-final was yesterday turned down by Uefa \u2013 Walcott is expected to start as the spearhead in a 4-2-3-1 formation. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Walcott's manager at Arsenal, sees him as a second striker in the longer term but Pearce hopes that the 20-year-old can use his pace to make the lone role work. For two years Pearce has prepared his players for this moment and he made it plain that the role of \"gallant loser\" would be unacceptable. \"The only way we can be deemed a success is if we win,\" he said. \"Whoever doesn't win will not have achieved anything.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
