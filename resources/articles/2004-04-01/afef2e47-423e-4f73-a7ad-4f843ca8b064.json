In fact, the largest, most visible, yet historically least pondered organ of the body is currently subject to energetic levels of scrutiny. The Book of Skin is published only a year after another major cultural study of the subject, Skin, by Claudia Benthien, and hot on the heels of Virginia L Blum's Flesh Wounds, an examination of the culture in which incising and redraping of the epidermis has become a normal activity. Two television series dealing with cosmetic surgery have recently been shown, while the notion of the skin as an artist's canvas, or as the shock-packed material of the artwork itself, has, with bathetic celerity, plunged from the sensational to the hackneyed. An area for so long overlooked by cultural historians is now such a hot topic that skin is not so much a swath of interconnected cells as a palimpsest, choked with meaning and symbol. As Steven Connor writes: \"The skin, normally as little apparent as the page upon which are displayed the words we read, is becoming visible on its own account.\" It is, naturally, in our semiotics-infused times, a \"substance, vehicle and metaphor\". Books of skin do, quite literally, exist. The tradition of leather bindings reaches its stomach-churning apogee with a flurry of 18th- and 19th-century volumes bound in the flayed skin of reprobates. William Corder, convicted of the murder of Maria Marten, was hanged, dissected, and then recycled as a book binding for a presentation copy of an account of his crimes. For those with specialist tastes in the bibliodermic, this particular publication is still intact in Bury St Edmunds. Gallows confessions were a rip-roaring genre, and the odd freakish curiosity bound in the tanned skin of the lawless could naturally become a collector's item. The Bristol Records Office, for example, contains an account of the trial and execution of a young felon called John Horwood, which was bound in the culprit's skin and neatly embossed with a gallows motif. One owner of a book on the subject of virginity explained in the flyleaf that the volume was \"bound in a piece of female skin which I myself tanned with sumac\", while a 19th-century Russian poet decided to use the skin from his own amputated leg to bind a collection of sonnets for his mistress. Skin can serve as the paper as well as the dustjacket. A disease called dermographia involves unusual sensitivity of the skin to the degree where the lightest touch produces a swelling, which in turn can form words and images, naturally giving rise to tales of stigmata, hysteria and miracles, not to mention the odd postmodernist artwork. According to James Joyce, \"modern man has an epidermis rather than a soul\". In studying that surface, we see not only the soul's workings - the complexion has long been considered the transmitter of emotion, for example - but also a series of often contradictory historical preoccupations. The Book of Skin seeks to wring every nuance of meaning attributed to the skin in western culture, and its author moves between fascinating and highly impressively researched historical fact, and symbol-laden cultural analysis bristling with metaphor. At times his work is obscure to the point of obfuscation: a self-referential round of paradigms and skin egos and symbolic spaces, perceived through a framework of 20th-century French philosophy. When we're back on course with the historical nitty-gritty and accompanying commentary, the book is simply passionate, illuminating and informed. The grotesqueries of the skin's pathology, children's love of scabs and their \"intense and abiding preoccupa tion with the uses of sticking-plaster\", the significance of flaying, scarification and tattooing, not to mention the ancient art of mole reading, are all covered in compelling detail. The notion of the skin as either an intact or a permeable entity has preoccupied different eras. The ancient Greeks were pretty wedded to the idea of an inviolable and immaculate skin, and were simultaneously fascinated by the practice of flaying and the wearing the skins of others, such as the hide of the Nemean lion worn by Hercules. Aristotle thought that skin was formed \"by the drying of the flesh, like the scum upon boiled substances\" (De Generatione Animalium), and the idea that the skin appeared last in the developing organism persisted for centuries. The taboo about breaking open the skin somewhat hindered the development of anatomical knowledge, yet for many centuries, the skin itself was not of particular interest: even the great anatomist Galen was primarily interested in its role as an impediment to what lay beneath. Because the skin is not separable from the living body, it has constantly been imagined in flight from it. In a graphic example, Michelangelo pictures Pietro Aretino holding the flayed skin of St Bartholomew in The Last Judgment. As Benthien has illustrated, the skinned male traditionally embodies myths of liberation, whereas the flayed female is entirely taboo. As Connor points out, however potent such flaying fantasies, when the skin is literally separated from the body, it causes disgust: \"... emptied skins - the flayed skin of the \u00e9corch\u00e9, a discarded sock, the hinge of skin hanging off after a finger has been cut, strike us as so pitiful, so inhuman, so painful, so disgusting.\" This is essentially an exhaustive thesis for the academic market, richly conceived and elaborately thought out. No flicker of meaning has escaped Connor's ferocious, all-seeing eye. In fact, the man appears to have X-ray vision. It's very hard to imagine any contemporary writer now adding to this monolith. But let's face it, before long, someone will have a stab. \u00b7 Joanna Briscoe's Skin is published by Phoenix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
