The news came as a source close to Prince Harry said he is \u201cgetting regular updates\u201d about the inquiry into journalist Martin Bashir\u2019s conduct in arranging the landmark show. The investigation will consider if the steps taken by the corporation and Bashir were appropriate and to what extent those actions influenced Princess Diana\u2019s decision to give an interview in which she disclosed her marital problems with Prince Charles a year before their divorce. It will also examine what knowledge the BBC had in 1995 and 1996 of \u201cmocked up bank statements purporting to show payments to a former employee of Earl Spencer [and] the purported payments to members of the Royal Households\u201d, the corporation said. The broadcaster has appointed a retired judge, Lord Dyson, former master of the rolls, to lead the investigation. Spencer previously alleged he was shown \u201cfalse bank statements\u201d by Bashir and they were used to help the reporter gain an introduction to the princess. He tweeted on Friday night: \u201cAs I\u2019ve told the BBC this evening, I\u2019m not at all satisfied with the parameters they\u2019ve set around their enquiry into the BBC Panorama interview with Diana of 25 years ago tonight. Lord Dyson must be free to examine every aspect of this matter, from 1995 to today, as he sees fit.\u201d It came as a source close to Prince Harry said reports in the press about his public silence on the Panorama interview were attempts to \u201cdrive a wedge between\u201d him and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge. The source, in comments reported by several media outlets, said: \u201cHarry is getting regular updates and is aware of everything that is happening. \u201cYou do not need a public statement to imagine how he is feeling privately, people know how much his mother means to him.\u201d The source added: \u201cHe has bravely spoken out in the past about loss and grief, and the immense impact it has had on him. \u201cSadly, some people are not just seeing this as a drive for truth, but also trying to use this as an opportunity to try to drive a wedge between the brothers.\u201d On Thursday, Prince William publicly welcomed the investigation into the interview, describing it as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d. The BBC has insisted that the investigation has a sufficiently broad scope. A spokesman said: \u201cThe review is fully independent and the terms are suitably broad and wide-ranging. \u201cWe hope that everyone will support Lord Dyson\u2019s work in establishing the truth.\u201d Last week the corporation said it had found a handwritten note from Princess Diana stating she did not see the false bank statements and they played no part in her decision to grant Bashir the interview. The BBC said Bashir, its religious affairs editor, is signed off from work relating to a coronavirus infection earlier this year and a quadruple heart bypass. As a result he is unable to answer questions relating to the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
