David McBride is facing lengthy jail time for providing documents to the public broadcaster on the conduct of special forces in Afghanistan, which prompted the Wednesday raids. McBride is far from alone in his plight. Witness K and Bernard Collaery, who revealed Australia\u2019s unlawful 2004 spy operation against Timor-Leste, are facing two years behind bars for their actions, and the Australian Taxation Office whistleblower, Richard Boyle, is facing a lengthy jail sentence for exposing aggressive debt collection tactics that were destroying the lives of vulnerable taxpayers. In all three cases, the whistleblowers went through the appropriate steps to raise their concerns internally within government, before frustration at inaction led them into going public. They believed doing so would help afford them protections under Australia\u2019s whistleblower regime. \u201cI made an internal complaint, I even went to the police first, I invoked whistleblower protections,\u201d McBride told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s all a sham.\u201d McBride said the inaction on his complaints led him to the ABC. The lawyer says he was simply acting on his duty to report illegal conduct, and only wanted to protect Australia\u2019s interest. \u201cI think it says everything about the problem today that if you describe my situation without saying my nationality, you would think we were talking about China or Russia,\u201d McBride said. \u201cThe idea that someone who basically suggested something was going wrong from within an organisation \u2026 is put in jail forever as a spy, that\u2019s what totalitarian regimes do. \u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion that I\u2019m actually damaging national security. I think the government is damaging national security, and yet they\u2019re treating me as if I\u2019m a terrorist.\u201d McBride\u2019s comments again raise concerns about the ability of whistleblower protections to help those wanting to expose government wrongdoing. In the case of Witness K and Collaery, the pair aired their concerns internally as required. Witness K sought and obtained permission to talk to his lawyer, Collaery, about an illegal spy operation bugging Timor-Leste\u2019s government during sensitive oil negotiations, raising his concerns through the inspector-general of intelligence and security. Frustrated by the inaction, they contacted a series of journalists. Both are now facing two years behind bars for doing so. Boyle, the ATO whistleblower, similarly made an internal disclosure under the Public Interest Disclosure (PID) Act to the ATO. His complaint was investigated and dismissed, according to the ABC and the Nine Entertainment newspapers. Boyle then went public. \u201cIt says the government of Australia actually only cares about the government of Australia, and doesn\u2019t actually care about Australia anymore,\u201d McBride said. \u201cSo if you speak out against the government, you\u2019re a really bad person, even if you\u2019re sticking up for the nation.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve forgotten that they\u2019re actually meant to work for the people of Australia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
