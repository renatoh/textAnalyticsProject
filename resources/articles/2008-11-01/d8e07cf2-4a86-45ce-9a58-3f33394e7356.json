Yet in London the situation is reversed, as the recent attacks on bloggers by the Evening Standard's Andrew Gilligan show. Unlike the national picture, the most influential political websites covering London government are not those of the right but those that expose the London mayoralty to scrutiny and examination. Four sites in particular \u2013 the MayorWatch website and the bloggers Dave Hill, Torytroll and Boriswatch \u2013 have established themselves as part of the political landscape in London politics, widely read by politicians, journalists, London government officers and campaigners. The growth of this phenomenon has produced a heavy-handed backlash. Twice in the past month Gilligan has used the platform of the Standard to attack the City Hall bloggers (he has subsequently clarified that MayorWatch, which is not a blog, was not one of those he intended to criticise). \"There's a certain mad nobility in the way Boris's opponents seem determined to strap themselves to the most unpopular causes going,\" he wrote. \"You wonder what's next \u2013 a support group for double-glazing salesmen? A bid to rehabilitate that misunderstood feminist icon, demonised by the rightwing media, Rose West?\" One of his targets, Boriswatch \u2013 almost certainly unheard of to most Standard readers at that point \u2013 was dismissed as \"unintentionally hilarious\". He was back last week. Most of these blogs \"read more like Private Eye parodies, daily finding new evidence of sinister neocon evil in Johnson's choice of breakfast cereal\", he claimed. \"Even the more measured ones simply copy stories from other media outlets (they all have a particular, and flattering, obsession with the Standard). Boris's enemies in Nerdistan won't do much damage until they learn the difference between investigative journalism and a Google search.\" The return fire from the blogs has certainly not been timid, generating its own new controversy that has seeped into other media and today has seen another outbreak of hostilities in this controversy on the ToryTroll site. Why did this blogger-battering misfire? The line was that the blogs were an amateur joke. But you don't take the time and space in a mass-circulation paper to repeatedly bash an irrelevance. They are a target precisely because they are doing something interesting and relevant. Second, the reference to Google revealed a yawning cultural gap. As Tom Barry, one of the regular Boriswatch contributors, says, their site is \"completely grass roots\". Torytroll blogger Adam Bienkov argues that \"political blogs are unlikely to ever have the mass readership that newspapers and broadcasters have, but they do have an influential readership\". Of the thousands who read his site \"a couple of hundred will be those people who can shift the news or political agenda\". Agenda-setting was exactly what Dave Hill did during the mayoral election this year: his Mayor and More blog probably did more than any other news outlet to develop the story of the spectacular implosion of the finances of Boris Johnson's \"new Routemaster\" bus policy over a number of weeks. Torytroll meanwhile has been quietly but persistently digging away at the implications of Boris Johnson's policy to cut the police budget in real terms. There certainly needn't be an inherent antagonism between online coverage and the old media. Blogs can't replace news media but they do give an outlet for people interested in specific areas, which in turn helps a story move on. Specialised coverage generates perspectives that other observers might miss. The MayorWatch editor Martin Hoscik says his objective is to provide news of the mayor and assembly based on a real knowledge of how the GLA operates \u2013 hence the likelihood of spotting when City Hall resorts to needless spin. The London bloggers show a way forward for those who want to see more progressive opinion on the web in this country. For Labour, which is currently grappling with this question, it means their supporters should be using their blogs to get stuck in to their local Tory MPs or Tory councils, holding them to account and getting that information out as widely as possible, as many are already doing. But it includes another important lesson. Bloggers in London did it for themselves. They are independent-minded: they weren't told to do it by parties or campaigns. They just did it. Old-style command and control doesn't apply. The recent blogger-bashing happened because the City Hall-watching sites usurp the narrative of Boris Johnson's backers in the conventional media. Their impertinence in not accepting the verdict of the editorials and op-eds has made them news. Blogs and websites may seem to represent a small breach of this official line, but as the saying goes, there is a crack in everything; that's how the light gets in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
