Of course, the downside to such engagement is that for every Lemonade you\u2019re likely to get 10 sixth-form common-room jam bands wailing about \u201cTONY B-LIAR\u201d. Dumb Blood, the debut album from London outfit Vant, unquestionably falls into the latter camp. Workaday nu-grunge in sound, it distinguishes itself from the pack with vocalist Mattie Vant\u2019s toe-curlingly gauche lyrics: think Bush if Gavin Rossdale had skim-read Chomsky for Dummies in WH Smith before recording Razorblade Suitcase. Opener The Answer boils down the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d to the thoughtful couplet \u201cYou\u2019re from England, well Hello there my brother / Keep sucking my dick, while my friend fucks your mother,\u201d while Peace and Love only just falls short of calling for the world to sing in perfect harmony. \u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up\u201d, Vant wrote in a mission statement letter accompanying Dumb Blood\u2019s release. If this is the soundtrack to the revolution, a lie-in looks preferable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
