In stark contrast, Speed Racer turns the pastel pinks up to 11, conjuring a retina-threatening festival of sugarcoated eye-candy which makes the average episode of Teletubbies look sinisterly underlit. If you ever wondered what it would feel like to snort Vimto or stick your head into a candyfloss spinner (who hasn't?), then take a hit of this insanely oversweetened paean to primary colours. Based on the kinetic Japanese manga-anime series Mach GoGoGo, which was redubbed Speed Racer for Stateside audiences, this cleancut, milk-drinking romp follows the fortunes of the titular driver (yes, that's his name, played by Emile Hirsch) as he strives to become the fastest man on Earth. This he does by drifting through a string of loop-the-loop racetrack fantasias in a blizzard of cutting-edge digital fizz. En route to the finishing flag, Speed is forced to choose between loyalty to the Team Racer family clan and selling his soul to corporate bigwigs with zero sporting spirit. One presumes that the film-makers considered this conflict to be the underlying 'theme' of the piece since crucial time is wasted as characters contemplate corporate corruption in a manner which will surely bore or baffle the core kids' audience. But it's the eye-popping pyrotechnic race sequences which remain the film's true raison d'etre, achieving a level of deranged virtual otherworldliness amounting to an attention-deficit cinematic sugar rush with an extreme pop-art psychedelic sensibility. Perhaps the plot problems explain Speed Racer's resounding failure in cinemas, but on DVD a little editing with the fast forward button allows the viewer to cut to the chase with winning results. Shame the Wachowskis weren't on hand to provide lap-bylap commentary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
