Savannah, four, and Indianna, three, were found dead at their house in Watsonia and a man known to them was arrested at the scene on Sunday afternoon. Police issued a statement early on Monday saying Charles Mihayo, of Watsonia, had been charged with the murder of both girls and remanded in custody to appear at the Melbourne magistrates court on Tuesday. Police have yet to reveal how the children died or give details of any injuries. A number of family members were at the home at the time. An assistant police commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said the tragedy had touched many. \"This is a tragic set of circumstances that has impacted on the family, and there were a number of family members here at the time,\" he said at the scene. \"It's naturally impacted on friends, neighbours and also on members of the fire brigade, the ambulance services and members of Victoria police who have attended the scene today.\" Police were called to the Longmuir Road home about 2.40pm. Ambulance Victoria said paramedics had treated two people in a critical condition there for some time, but could not save them. A neighbour said the deaths were hard to comprehend. \"[I feel] sick to the stomach,\" he said. \"It's really hard to believe this could happen in a quiet little suburban street.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
