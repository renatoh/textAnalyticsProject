Many of the show\u2019s most visually striking moments focus on how, in the world of Gilead, the individual is simply less important than the group. Overhead shots of Handmaids walking two-by-two, whether to participate in some grand ceremony or to simply go shopping with their assigned partner, are oddly beautiful, serene. The Handmaids look like otherworldly creatures, like brightly colored birds, standing out against the backdrop of the rest of the world. Though they are routinely tortured, raped and forced into compliance, they spend much of their time tottering about the gorgeous homes of the commanders and their wives, each designed to look like an oddly violent and fascistic Williams-Sonoma catalogue with regal kitchens, spacious living rooms and elegant bedrooms, complete with grand marital beds where handmaids are ceremonially raped. Shots of this kind, showing a creepy and strangely beautiful side of Gilead, are punctured with closeup looks at June\u2019s face, almost always grimacing. It\u2019s odd that after so many seasons, June, who bizarrely chooses to remain in Gilead in order to try to rescue her first daughter, hasn\u2019t perfected a convincing pretend-smile. Each time the camera homes in on one of her servile smirks, you can practically see her winking at the camera, reminding us that she hasn\u2019t drunk the Gilead Kool-Aid. You would think that learning to fake emotions might be especially useful skill in a place where female servitude is paramount, but, strangely, June\u2019s obstinacy seems to have earned her a little fan club, with the commander and his wife each seeking out June for genuine advice throughout the first episodes of the third season. While season two disturbed viewers with its emphasis on depicting heightened violence against women in lurid detail, season three aims to be a subtler psychological examination of the leadership of Gilead, and even asks that we feel some compassion towards June\u2019s tormentors, even as they continue to allow and encourage a terrible and brutal regime. Certainly, many of the great TV dramas of the past 15 years have offered humane and nuanced looks at complicated characters who do bad things. Indeed, the 21st century fascination with the antihero has made cheering on bad guys a veritable hobby. But while shows such as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men and The Americans offer subtle examinations of morally dubious figures, the villains of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale simply haven\u2019t earned this tender second look. It feels like emotional whiplash to suddenly ask viewers to feel sorry for characters who have spent the majority of two seasons raping and torturing their captives. In the same way, focusing on whether or not Fred and Serena can get through marital problems, many of which stem from the commander chopping off his wife\u2019s pinky for her insubordination in season two, is strangely centered throughout much of the new season, another departure from the show\u2019s allegorical roots. Is there anyone out there who is actually rooting for this horrible couple and hoping that June can counsel them through tough times? Similarly, Aunt Lydia\u2019s character, though marvelously acted by actress Ann Dowd, isn\u2019t given enough backstory so that we actually feel sorry for her when she collapses in tears at one particularly tragic moment this season, as well as later embrace June in a tenderhearted and genuine hug before placing an even more dehumanizing piece of clothing on June, one that literally covers her mouth. It is clear that by extending June\u2019s stay in Gilead, the show\u2019s writers have placed themselves in a kind of conundrum \u2013 how to extend the story without simply repeating the same violence against women over and over again? Season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale attempts to go deeper into the emotional breadth of its story, but there is little the viewer needs to learn about Gilead at this juncture other than the obvious: that the regime is horrible, destructive, and deserves to be destroyed. In one scene in the middle of the season, we see a mutilated handmaid, a reminder that whatever personal growth that June has experienced is futile since she is up against a powerful regime that is so thoroughly monstrous that there is no humanity left to grapple with. At its best, season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale works as an exceptionally creepy psychological study of the delusional creators and facilitators of Gilead. In my favorite scene of the first six episodes distributed to critics, we see Fred and Serena play a game of tea party with another commander\u2019s child. They smile warmly at each other, as Serena lifts a hand-sewn pretend pinky finger, a gift from her Martha, as if her original pinky wasn\u2019t cruelly cut off her hand by the very husband she now plays a children\u2019s game with. Still, the main issue of the series is that it tends towards shocking viewers with the cruel horrors of Gilead rather than offering genuine character development. Though June repeatedly says that she is a different person after being in Gilead, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of evidence that she is. Certainly, it\u2019s a relief that June is as angry and resistant as ever, but I\u2019m not sure that continuing to drag June through the physical and psychological horrors of Gilead over and over again does much to advance the plot or move us emotionally forward. At a time when we see more and more reproductive freedoms being taken away from women, a show like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale needs to be more than a series of provocative and frightening images on repeat. June deserves a story that doesn\u2019t necessarily give her a pat, happy ending, but that does, ultimately, give her a potential way out. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is released on Hulu on Tuesdays and will premiere in the UK on Channel 4 on 9 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
