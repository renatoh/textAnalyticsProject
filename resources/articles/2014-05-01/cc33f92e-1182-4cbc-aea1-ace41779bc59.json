The ABC managing director faced Senate estimates on Wednesday, revealing staff redundancies would start at the ABC in the next few weeks in the wake of cuts to funding and could not guarantee the safety of regional radio stations or programs on the children\u2019s channel, ABC3 But it was a question about Peppa Pig that has dominated headlines and political discussion. Scott was asked by Senator Louise Pratt if he could guarantee he would not cut Peppa Pig, in a reference to a Piers Ackerman column in the Daily Telegraph last year which claimed the show had a feminist agenda. Scott replied in the same vein as when he was asked to guarantee any program: \u201cWe have contracts to continue to deliver Peppa Pig but of course services we provide depend on the funding envelope provided.\u201d His refusal to rule anything in or out on program cuts triggered headlines about Peppa Pig being sent to the abattoir. The hugely popular British cartoon is the ABC\u2019s No 1 children\u2019s television show on iView and the broadcaster is also licensed to sell official merchandise through its shops. The communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, joined the fray to reassure panicking parents by tweeting on Wednesday night that Peppa Pig\u2019s was \u201cone snout we are happy to have in the ABC trough\u201d. The opposition\u2019s communications spokesman, Jason Clare, called the government \u201ccarnivores\u201d and demanding they save Peppa Pig\u2019s \u201cbacon\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s office weighed in, warning the ABC off cutting the program. \u201cRather than butchering Peppa Pig, the ABC could, as a suggestion, consider trimming the fat off overseas broadcasts for Q&amp;A which Senate estimates was told today cost in excess of $200,000 per show,\u201d a spokeswoman told the Australian. Scott had also told estimates he could not guarantee regional radio stations would not close as a result of the ABC\u2019s budget being reduced by about $120m over the next four years in the budget. \u201cThe size of our regional footprint and number of local radio stations we can afford to remain open and what\u2019s the most efficient use of that will depend on the funding envelope we\u2019re operating,\u201d he said. The ABC is also suffering as a result of the early cancellation of the 10-year Australia Network contract, according to Scott, who said it was not just seen as a cut to the Australia Network, but a cut to the broadcaster as a whole. \u201cThe Australia Network impact will have an impact on news that can be seen locally but will not have direct impact on news created in Australia,\" he said. \u201cWe will lose some reporting positions in foreign bureaus on the back of the Australia Network decision \u2026 there will be reduction in news teams on back of that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
