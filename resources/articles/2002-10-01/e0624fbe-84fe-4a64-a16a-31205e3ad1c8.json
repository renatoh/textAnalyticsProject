Apparently, a website that incited mob violence had been discovered, causing Cambridgeshire police to hold an \"urgent pre-dawn briefing\". The site in question wasn't named but, judging from the description and unless Diary is very much mistaken, it appears to be Thinkofthechildren.co.uk. In poor taste at times it may be but anyone with half a brain could see that the site is a Chris Morris-style attempt at satire. The fact that it was recently at the centre of a stand-off between Host Europe, which hosts the site, and Paul Carr, the site's creator, should also perhaps have alerted them to the fact that it's a spoof. After originally agreeing to take the site down at the \"informal\" request of the police, Host Europe received hundreds of complaints from the internet fraternity and finally accepted that the site wasn't breaking any laws and didn't deserve to be removed. \u00b7 Moss Bros must be making the majority of its profits from the new media community at the moment, such is the rash of awards ceremonies. Last week alone saw the Association of Online Publishers Awards and the Bafta Interactive Awards take place at posh venues around the capital. The inaugural AOP Awards (previously the PPAi Awards) were perhaps the most feisty of the two and it was heart-warming to note that the enmity between Emap and IPC is still as strong in the online arena as it is the magazine world. The latter came out on top on this occasion because, despite getting rid of the majority of its websites, IPC had the good sense to hold on to NME.com, which has gone from strength to strength while the magazine flounders. It picked up three awards, including best editor for head honcho Anthony Thornton, but there was some consolation for Emap thanks to the rockers from Kerrang, who picked up the award for best new site. \u00b7 Last week, Hutchison 3G unveiled the logo and brand identity for its new 3G mobile service, the imaginatively named 3. According to Hutchison: \"The logo has a light titanium outside and a dynamic, playful, vibrant inside, animating through the whole spectrum of colour. The contrast between the outside and the inside articulates the spirit of 3: cool on the outside, hot on the inside, echoing the same spirit as the tough outer shell of the 3G handsets and the cauldron of dynamic information and entertainment inside.\" Diary reckons the logo looks like a throwback to a 1970s heavy metal album sleeve and encapsulates a company desperately hoping that the public will buy into 3G technology. But there you go. Owen Gibson is new media of mediatheguardian.com (owen.gibson@theguardian.com)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
