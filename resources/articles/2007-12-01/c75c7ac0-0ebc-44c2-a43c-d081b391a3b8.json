The Scotland international, who was again among the substitutes at Old Trafford yesterday, has been frustrated by a lack of first-team opportunities at Goodison Park amid the impressive form of Yakubu, James Vaughan and Andrew Johnson. \"I'd love to play in the Premier league but if a chance to go back up to Scotland came in and I felt it was the right thing to do then I would do it,\" said the former Motherwell player. \"It would be nice to be back with my family and back playing again.\" Everton have no intention of selling McFadden, meaning a short-term move may represent an ideal scenario for both parties with an option for Celtic to buy the player in the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
