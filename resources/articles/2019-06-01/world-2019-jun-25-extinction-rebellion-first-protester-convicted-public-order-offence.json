Angie Zelter, 68, was given a conditional discharge at Hendon magistrates court on Tuesday after being arrested for lying in the road near Parliament Square on 17 April. She had been taking part in protests in which thousands of people blocked key sites across the capital over 10 days to highlight the escalating climate emergency. Defending herself, Zelter outlined the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d scientific evidence of climate chaos and the threat ecological breakdown posed to the future of humanity, citing a swath of scientific studies, UN-backed reports and academic papers. She told the court that although this was only a \u201cdry summary\u201d and a \u201cminute fraction\u201d of the available evidence, it proved that her peaceful civil disobedience was both necessary and proportionate. Zelter told magistrates that humans faced mass extinction unless governments implemented wide-ranging changes. The judge, Margot Coleman, said that although she was mindful of the evidence from Zelter, the case \u201cwas a matter of law not morality\u201d. \u201cYour argument does not provide you with a defence to these charges,\u201d she said. Zelter, who has been involved in various campaigns concerning the arms trade, environmentalism and nuclear weapons since the early 1980s, was convicted of breaching a section 14 order, which the court heard had been imposed because the Extinction Rebellion protests were causing widespread disruption to businesses and the wider community. The order gives police the power to clear static protests from a specified area. The court heard she had been lying in the road near Parliament Square and refused to move when asked to do so by the police. Zelter disputed the implementation of the section 14 order, arguing the disruption was minimal compared with the \u201cchaos that will ensue from climate breakdown\u201d. \u201cI am fearful for the future for myself, for my family and for all living creatures on this fragile planet,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe there is a real and substantial threat to all our lives, and that, in accordance with the science, urgent and systemic changes to our society must be taken now to mitigate the danger. That is why I took action.\u201d Zelter said her history of campaigning and protests \u2013 she has established various protest groups and been arrested and imprisoned several times \u2013 proved she had not made the decision to take part in the Extinction Rebellion action lightly. \u201cI hope it shows that my actions \u2026 were not taken spontaneously or lightly but came out of [a] lifetime [of] concerns and that I have tried everything I could think of to create the changes necessary to combat climate change and prevent catastrophic collapse.\u201d She said the overwhelming evidence of climate breakdown had left her feeling \u201cfrustrated, depressed and, at times, hopeless\u201d. \u201cI cannot really understand why those \u2018in power\u2019 have refused to act. After all, it is their world too \u2026 \u201d she said. \u201cWhen our society and ecosystem collapses around us, none of us will be able to eat, drink, or breathe money.\u201d Coleman ordered her to pay \u00a3640 costs, but Zelter said she would not. Speaking outside the court she said she was considering an appeal. \u201cI am sad that the judge did not take the broader view of finding me not guilty because of the severity and urgency of the climate emergency,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
