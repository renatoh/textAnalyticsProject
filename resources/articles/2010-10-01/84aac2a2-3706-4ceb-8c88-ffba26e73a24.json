And if that's true it's a worry, for it can only be the result of a lack of confidence between too many forces and the public they serve. West Midlands police is doing all it can. It has a lovely \"big society\" motto, \"Serving our communities, protecting them from harm\". But the message isn't always a consistent one, as anyone who saw the force's Operational Support Unit van guarding last week's Tory conference from such as the uppity \"right to work\" marchers will attest. The van displayed in its front window a force letterhead next to the motif Operational Support Unit and the Latin slogan oderint dum metuant \u2013 or \"Let them hate so long as they fear\". At least that is what it said until yesterday when we flagged it up to force headquarters. It has now been taken down for being \"totally inappropriate and unacceptable\". Culprits are being sought. Disciplinary action will follow. Oderint dum metuant was a favourite saying of the Roman emperor Caligula, apparently \u2013 a colourful figure who excelled at many things. Perhaps one was neighbourhood policing. \u2022 They're just words, but in the wrong place they can cause a great deal of trouble and anguish. Think of astrologist Jonathan Cainer, whose carefully crafted horoscope column in yesterday's Daily Mail was blighted by the gremlins. In rogue first edition copies of the paper, Cainer's sage advice and instructions were nowhere to be seen. Instead the paper published \"dummy\" text that should never have left the building. \"It's extremely boring if you should actually bother to read it,\" was one choice cut from the repetitive slab of technical text strewn across half a page. Jonathan saw it coming, no doubt. \u2022 Yes, words can be a balm or a harm. Katie Fforde will know that. As one of the country's leading romantic novelists, they are her stock in trade. Lovely woman Katie. Her hobbies are \"singing in the local choir, flamenco dancing, shopping and watching television\". But you wouldn't know it from reading Cotswold Life, the free glossy magazine delivered to homes in the area. For in its description of the 100 great \"movers and shakers\" in the area, it transposes her citation with that of ex-Blur bassist Alex James. Thus, erroneously, it describes her setting aside \"years of champers and cocaine excess to embrace the idyll of Cotswold farm life\". She'll find that hilarious, her agent tells us. Hope so. Wonder how many libel lawyers move and shake around there? \u2022 Big money in libel. Big money these days in education, and those following the adventures of E-Act \u2013 the academy trust that pays its boss, Sir Bruce Liddington, \u00a3265,000 a year to oversee 11 schools \u2013 may be pleased to hear they have hired a new finance director. E-Act, which is wholly funded by public money, has been beset with accusations of poor financial management. Liddington at first denied but then admitted claiming \u00a31,436 on deluxe hotel suites for two nights for himself and a colleague. Another senior director of E-Act repeatedly claimed \u00a3250 to take a taxi from Lincolnshire to his home in south Wales, copies of receipts show. A good time then to bring in someone who is happy accounting for large amounts of money. Step forward Clive Medlam, who was acting director of resources at Barnet council when \u00a327.4m was deposited in the Icelandic banks Glitnir and Landsbanki. Since it all went wrong, no money has been recovered, despite his best attempts to get some back. Still, councillors ultimately decide these things. E-Act is happy to have found its man, and we in turn are happy for it. \"Medlam has a wonderful track record,\" the academy says. \u2022 And finally, an end to the debate, there is such a thing as society. It may have flopped at the election, say the Tories, but come what may, we are sticking by the \"big society\". It may be a hard sell, says Labour, but our vision continues to be the \"good society\". And Kate Moss, we learn, became more popular after she was caught on camera snorting cocaine; testament to the \"high society\". When it all goes wrong, society will be to blame."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
