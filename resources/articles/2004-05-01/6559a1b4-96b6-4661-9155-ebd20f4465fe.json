Whether you want to build a simple extension or a 200-unit development, rare species and their government guardians can put a stop to your plans. Bats cause homeowners most headaches. It is an offence to destroy, damage or obstruct any bat roost or disturb any bat occupying one. Peter, a photographer from East Anglia, was less than pleased when bats moved into his roof just as he put his house on the market. This is not his real name as he handled the situation by breaking the law. 'People in the village said they caused damage and we thought buyers would be put off because they limit what you can do to a house,' he confesses. 'So we watched to see the holes they used, blocked them and, hey presto, no more bats.' Peter's actions could have earned him a fine of \u00a35,000 per bat disturbed. If you plan work that may disturb bats, you must notify English Nature or its equivalents elsewhere in the UK. Andrew Sharkey, a PR consultant, was shocked to discover that his new home had a registered bat colony in the attic the day his family moved into their detached Victorian house in rural East Sussex. 'The previous owner left details about them along with things like how to work the boiler,' he recalls. 'We weren't happy because we thought they would be a problem if we wanted to extend the house.' Seven years on the Sharkeys are thinking about an attic extension. 'The bat conservancy people and our architect helped us round it,' Andrew says. 'Essentially we can have our new loft, but we have to build them one, too, and cannot do the work at certain times of year.' Pity any developer who discovers bats or any other protected species living on site. No work can be done until the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) grants a licence, which causes expensive delays. 'Bats cannot be disturbed during hibernation or their spring breeding season,' says John Bresnaham, a director of Michael Wilson Restoration, which is seeking permission to restore a grade II-listed manor at Chew Magna near Bristol and build 10 new homes in its grounds. 'You only have a small window of opportunity during the summer to do any potentially disruptive work. Unless planning permission and a Defra licence are granted at the right time, you can have to wait a year before starting work.' To replace roosts for colonies of Pipistrelle, horseshoe and vesper bats it proposes to demolish, the company has had to build a special 'bat hotel' at a cost of about \u00a318,000. English Nature ensures the planning system complies with government wildlife policy and protection directives. As Jonathan Price, its senior planning adviser, explains: 'The ideal is if developers survey sites well in advance of plans so that protected species can be accommodated within a project or transported elsewhere.' Last year Barratt Homes spent more than \u00a330,000 'airlifting' 400 common lizards (despite the name, very rare) to a new habitat on Bishop's Stortford golf course, Hertfordshire from their previous home on an old hospital site in the town centre which was being redeveloped. In a similar rescue operation at former army barracks near Camberley in Surrey, Barratts built two brick bat houses - complete with electric central heating - costing \u00a320,000 each for a colony of brown long-eared bats and Pipistrelles. At Bolnore Village near Haywards Heath, Crest Nicholson provided ways for animals to cross a new road. These included tunnels for badgers and rope bridges for dormice linking tree canopies on either side of the carriageway. Anyone who thinks wildlife issues arise only in rural areas would be mistaken. Urban wastegrounds have become a vital sanctuary where many species, including crested newts, water voles and peregrine falcons, thrive in a way they have not in the countryside for decades. What English Nature calls 'England's rainforest' is not a bosky vale but an old oil refinery on Canvey Island, home to many endangered insects and mammals. Not all urban endangered species are cute. The repulsive-sounding two-lipped Thames door snail is only found in two locations in the world. Unfortunately for Fairview New Homes, the second of these is their Ferry Quays development in Brentford. Fairview fenced off an area from public access, giving the molluscs a desirable riverside residence worth \u00a3135,000. The drive to develop brownfield sites along the Thames Gateway is bringing the clash between humanity and nature to a head. While adamant that wildlife must be protected, English Nature's Price believes it cannot be a barrier to growth in the south-east. Living with wildlife has an upside. Sharkey's children love watching bats swooping across the lawn on summer evenings. Perhaps perversely, Peter enjoys doing the same thing with the ones that live in his holiday home in France. The difficulty is balancing our need for places to live with those of endangered species. After all, how many snails would you evict to give your family a decent home?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
