Even after the sale of the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for \u00a380bn, and the dispatch of the bulk of the proceeds to shareholders, the company is still a \u00a350bn titan. What gem lay within the half-year figures to support such a strong reaction? There was no out-and-out sparkler. Guidance on top-line profits for the full-year barely budged: Vodafone expected to do no worse than \u00a311.6bn instead of \u00a311.4bn the last time it spoke. The interim dividend was nudged 2% higher, which hardly represents another outpouring of riches. As for free cash flow, it was \u201c\u00a30.0bn\u201d, as the statement put it \u2013 nil, as the rest of the world would say. Instead, the outbreak of enthusiasm flows from the vaguer idea that one of these quarters, Vodafone\u2019s service revenues (that is, revenues from voice, texts and data) will stop falling. The first quarter\u2019s decline was 4.25%; the second\u2019s was 1.5%. Keep that up and, after two years of going backwards, Vodafone could be back in growth early next year. Relative to low expectations, that\u2019s a big improvement, even if southern Europe (Italy down 9.7% in the second quarter; Spain at minus 9.3%) remains a drag. But the trends are improving everywhere apart from Portugal. That means chief executive Vittorio Colao could claim to have hit the spending accelerator at the right moment. His two-year \u00a37bn Project Spring capital expenditure top-up \u2013 designed to get Vodafone\u2019s 3G and 4G networks up to speed \u2013 may have landed in time to halt the persistent drip of customer defections. The new adventure into the UK broadband market will not be cost-free but it was inevitable: if BT wants to offer mobile phones, Vodafone had to fight back. As long as Colao doesn\u2019t get dragged into paying silly prices for TV content, and as long as Project Spring is not followed by an expensive Project Summer, cash flows should improve and find their way to shareholders. In other words, that 5% dividend yield looks safe-ish. Solid 5% yields at large companies are a rarity, as investors in supermarkets have learned. In the circumstances, the big share-price reaction was justified. It seems there is life in Vodafone after the Verizon Wireless excitement. Runway costs take off What a surprise: the cost of a building a new runway in the south-east has already run away from promoters\u2019 estimates. They are all guilty of over-optimism to the tune of a billion or three, according to the airports commission\u2019s harder-headed calculations. The commission itself has taken no risks with precise numbers. Thus we are told that the economic benefits of building a new runway at Heathrow would be \u00a3112bn-\u00a3211bn. What\u2019s \u00a399bn between friends? For the Heathrow Hub runway extension, the range is even wider at \u00a3101bn-\u00a3214bn. Gatwick comes in at \u00a342bn-\u00a3127bn. There is, of course, a reason why these estimates are so laughably wide. Everything depends on what other assumptions are plugged into the economic model. The \u00a3112bn figure for a new Heathrow runway is generated by the \u201crelative decline of Europe\u201d scenario; the \u00a3211bn comes from the \u201cglobal growth\u201d model. What these numbers really tell us is what we already know: expanding Heathrow generates the most benefits if you place a high economic value on more flights to inner China, Brazil, and all those other emerging markets. Expansion at Gatwick, however, would still get this column\u2019s vote: it would inflict less noise and pollution at home and would keep Heathrow\u2019s monopolistic tendencies in check. It also stands a greater chance of getting built. But don\u2019t risk a penny on Gatwick getting an official thumbs-up. The business lobby will now flog the economic argument relentlessly. There is no reason to doubt the independence of mind of chairman Sir Howard Davies and his commissioners but, in betting terms, this is starting to look like a two-horse race between Heathrow and Heathrow. Patent compromise \u201cThis a great deal for Britain,\u201d says chancellor George Osborne. OK, but surely you can\u2019t think it is greater than your original design of the patent box, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have made the tax breaks for intellectual property so generous in the first place. Welcome to the world of political compromise. Germany objected to Osborne\u2019s much championed patent box and Britain has had to give ground; quite how much ground is unclear as the details are, to say the least, cloudy. The Treasury denies a U-turn but that is what it looks like. The previous official line was that this Osborne flagship policy would survive European scrutiny intact. But compromise is sensible. The bigger fight against multinationals\u2019 tax avoidance wheezes requires an united front from Europe\u2019s big players. On the patent box, the UK had found itself standing shoulder to shoulder with Luxembourg, not a comfortable position. It is far better to agree a deal with Germany and concentrate on the main event."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
