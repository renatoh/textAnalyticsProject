Despite cringe-making problems with defective microphones which marred the opening session, morale at the Conservative conference so far has been better than the advance publicity - almost certainly better than party managers dared hope a few days ago. That is partly the result of Labour miscalculation in letting election speculation drift to the point where Mr Brown will lose face if he decides against one. Tory MPs and activists are as divided as were Labour's last week as to his intentions. It all helps raise the mood of a rank and file which wants to win again after a decade of defeat. They may be older and whiter than Labour's delegates, but are more representatively diverse than they used to be. The brighter mood has been enhanced by fighting frontbench speeches in the past 36 hours, several as weighty - pound for pound - as those from less experienced Labour cabinet ministers in Bournemouth last week. Cheeky George Osborne, his penchant for teasing the prime minister undiminished, was yesterday's star on the Lancashire coast. It may not greatly matter that his speech was dissed by ministers, Lib Dems and by the more disinterested Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). All disparaged his questionable plans to offset higher thresholds for stamp duty and inheritance tax (IHT) with a \u00a325,000 poll tax on Britain's 150,000 foreign non-domiciled residents. It may be irrational - in reality not many Daily Express readers pay IHT - but politically the Tories are on to a good one, even if it eventually flops in practice. Sharp-suited Osborne aides are confident that it won't. At the end of the day, this is about credibility. Before lunch Andrew Lansley, Michael Gove and others made more persuasive declarations of their love for state-funded public services than their party has managed in a long time. About time too. At the Guardian debate on the fringe Oliver Letwin echoed others in patronisingly describing Labour's efforts to raise standards and reduce inequality as well-meaning. Mr Brown himself is exempt from such generosity. If he goes for it, they will come after him.
