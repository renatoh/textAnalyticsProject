With guitarist Kevin Eubanks relishing his return to the jazz spotlight after a long stint on the Tonight Show, the brilliant Craig Taborn switching between acoustic piano and Fender Rhodes, Charles Lloyd drummer Eric Harland playing updated jazz-rock patterns with a ferocious relish, and everybody contributing tunes, this band has a one-for-all collective drive that's already generating album-of-the-year mutterings. The chunky, hook-based The Watcher and the hypnotic Evolution suggest the old Mahavishnu Orchestra rather than a Holland band (Eubanks is a big John McLaughlin fan), while the leader's The Empty Chair \u2013 a salute to his late wife, Clare \u2013 is an aching guitar blues with a lyrical bass break. Though Taborn's Spirals and The True Meaning of Determination are melodic twisters in the old Holland-group mould, Eric Harland's Caribbean-inflected groover Choir is as open as laughter, and the keyboardist's straightahead piano-swing on it is awesome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
