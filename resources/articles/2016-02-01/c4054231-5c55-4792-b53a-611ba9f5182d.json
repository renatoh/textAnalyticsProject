Belgian surrealism was briefly invoked. Treachery was on people\u2019s lips. There were mutterings of suicidal tendencies. The backstabbing and brinkmanship knew no bounds. A day and a night at the theatre? In a manner of speaking. But this was the latest fiasco in what passes for EU summits these days where 28 grownups, all with countries to run and very demanding day jobs, converge in Brussels, stay up all night, forgo meals or ruin their digestion, and spend their time huddling in corridors plotting and crafting deals that then fall apart. By 10.30 on Friday evening Europe\u2019s leaders finalised a deal that, barring a referendum thumbs-down, looks likely to help David Cameron keep Britain in the EU. The 15 hours that preceded this were the day of the \u201cEnglish meal\u201d that never was \u2013 so named to mark the fact that the saga of polite but deep discord all revolved around David Cameron\u2019s need to go home clutching 16 pages of dense text that would be proclaimed as one of Britain\u2019s greatest ever victories in Europe. The sheaf of paper would fire the starting pistol in the race to a referendum, probably in June, to stay in or quit the EU. \u201cIt was all unnecessarily difficult,\u201d said one of the main negotiators. \u201cThere was a lot of irritation.\u201d The cynical view was we were indeed witnessing a meticulously choreographed piece of theatre staged to create the impression that Cameron might emerge bruised and bloodied but triumphant and more than half way to having the referendum in the bag. But there was also a more depressing possibility \u2013 that this was not theatre at all, that the leaders of 28 countries meant to be partners in the \u201cEuropean project\u201d really were spending all night long genuinely fighting over child benefits worth about \u00a335m to the British, savings probably exceeded by the costs of running the new system. When the summit kicked off at teatime on Friday, the word from Donald Tusk, chief fixer presiding over the session, was that he would labour through the night in a set of \u201cbilaterals\u201d with Cameron and four other leaders who each represented specific neuralgic points in the proposed deal. They would all then meet at 9am Fridayfor an \u201cEnglish breakfast\u201d to seal the deal. There was no breakfast. Instead brunch was listed for 11. That came and went, supplanted by \u201cEnglish lunch\u201d at half past one. That repast, too, never happened. The deadline shifted to 4pm with no mention of food as the \u201csherpas\u201d preparing these meetings and advising their leaders just munched apples instead in the press bar. And Team Cameron chewed on Haribos. The afternoon deadline lapsed with Tusk\u2019s spokesman tweeting that Cameron\u2019s rendezvous with destiny was now set for \u201cdinner, tbc\u201d. The biggest question for continental journalists was whether this meant a French or Italian dinner around 8pm or 9pm, or whether, with luck, the leaders hoped to do an \u201cEnglish teatime\u201d around 6pm. Faces dropped. It was to be 8pm. At the earliest. It was after 9pm when they got to the aperitifs, followed by artichoke, goat\u2019s cheese, then fillet of veal with tarragon. And the realisation dawned that the leaders could be so determined to have that full English breakfast that they would stagger through the night again into Saturday morning. While the meals were missed, Tusk and Cameron laboured on through a set of bilaterals held in a small unprepossessing room on the fifth floor of the Justus Lipsius building where Tusk has his office and where summits take place. It is a functional, sparsely furnished, room which Tusk, the president of the European council, uses to bang heads together, cobble together compromises and cut deals. But through the night and all of Friday the agreements eluded them. Cameron\u2019s interlocutors were Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, president of France, and the prime ministers Charles Michel (Belgium), Bohuslav Sobotka (Czech Republic) and Beata Szyd\u0142o (Poland). The French leader embodied the eurozone\u2019s struggle to find accommodation with the UK over financial regulation. The Belgian head represented opposition to the British prime minister\u2019s campaign against the EU\u2019s guiding motto of \u201cever-closer union\u201d. The east Europeans were the toughest customers for Cameron because their citizens would lose out from the welfare and child benefit curbs the British government needs to demonstrate that is doing something to try to lessen EU immigration to the UK. The British side let it be known that Cameron sought to woo the federalist Michel by presenting him with a French edition of the works of Beatrix Potter for a newborn daughter. In fact, the books were gifted a fortnight ago during the international Syria conference in London. Enda Kenny, the taoiseach and Cameron\u2019s biggest champion at the summit, took to quoting Macbeth along the lines of if this had to be done, best to get it done quickly. Macbeth, of course, was talking of murder, a point perhaps lost on most of Kenny\u2019s audience. In any case, there was no chance of getting it done quickly. And Cameron repeatedly stressed that he had all the time in the world to strike the right deal. He could wait till the end of next year, the deadline for his referendum, if need be. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good negotiator,\u201d said a sherpa from one of the EU\u2019s big founding countries. \u201cAnd compared to the rest of them Cameron\u2019s in a very strong position at home.\u201d There were two fundamental problems with a summit that veered back and forth between breakthrough and breakdown before going Cameron\u2019s way. The subject matter \u2013 extremely technical issues of financial regulation, juridical conundrums, and social security systems \u2013 was too complex for national leaders to grapple with and sort. It needed to be resolved by teams of government experts in lengthy negotiation before being put before government heads. The second problem was much more worrying. Europe\u2019s leaders no longer trust one another. It is difficult to recall a summit in recent years which has not been poisoned by mistrust, conflict and grievance. Last July they also went through the night for 17 hours with Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, and Alexis Tsipras, prime minister of Greece \u2013 eyeball-to-eyeball in a confrontation that nearly saw Greece kicked out of the euro. A month earlier, as the immigration crisis started, the leaders took to shouting across the room at one another until three in the morning. In the early hours of Friday, Merkel, who kept her distance from the British question, said: \u201cWe are always partners in Europe.\u201d It sounded as if she was at a different summit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
