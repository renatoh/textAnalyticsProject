In 2007, when asked to list his \"collections, artworks, jewellery, precious stones, gold\", Sarko simply said, \"n\u00e9ant\" \u2013 nil. The intervening five years have been good to him, however: this year's statement discloses valuable collections of luxury watches, stamps and, intriguingly, autographs (whose?), with a total value of \u20ac100,000. Most curious to many, however, is the rise in Sarko's total personal fortune from \u20ac2.1m to \u20ac2.7m during his time as president, given the eye-watering alimony he has revealed he is paying: \u20ac2,926 per month to his first wife and \u20ac3,000 per month to his second, the mother of his 14-year-old son. That's right \u2013 per month. \u2022 News that employment agency A4e has been made the government's preferred bidder to take over the running of another major public sector contract will have come as a great boon to the firm, we don't doubt, following a period that one might fairly describe as \"bumpy\". A4e, you remember, a key contractor of the government's \u00a35bn work programme, is at present the subject of two police inquiries into alleged fraud and a ministerial investigation into the firm's existing Whitehall contracts. The company's founder Emma Harrison is no longer its chairman \u2013 or David Cameron's \"back-to-work tsar\"\u2013 as a result. Now a correspondent writes pondering whether the firm is really best-placed to operate the Equality and Human Rights Commission's helpline, given its mixed experiences in the field. The firm, our mole recalls, won a tender in 2008 to operate a legal advice telephone line. Two years later the information commissioner fined A4e \u00a360,000 after an executive downloaded non-encrypted data on to a laptop that was then stolen from her home. The highly sensitive personal details of 24,000 people were on it. Not everyone's preference to run a helpline, perhaps. \u2022 From noted wag Brian Paddick, Lib Dem candidate for London mayor, a joke, as delivered to a party meeting this week. Q: Why is Boris Johnson so fond of the new hop-on, hop-off Routemaster buses? A: Because like his own house, they come with three entrances and two staircases. (In the interests of electoral impartiality, we should point out that the Diary is unaware of how many homes Johnson may own and, therefore, which residence Paddick may have been referring to.) \u2022 New heights of food pseudery, courtesy of Spanish \"megastronomy\" digital magazine Cookcircus, now available in English. What is megastronomy, you ask? Read on, for \"a trans-disciplinary look at the origin, the cause and consequences of gastronomy's creativity. An analysis of the human and the irrational of the contemporary gastronomical revolution warriors. A non-linear tale where history, cookery, wishes, coincidences, determination, liberty \u2026\" Yeah, yeah. Put a tortilla in it. \u2022 And finally, the Daily Galloway. We now know that one of the reasons George was able to cause such a spectacular electoral upset in Bradford West was by attracting a wide range of defectors from the other main parties. Among them, it now emerges, was former Conservative councillor Jamshed Khan. \"Me, my friends and family have been campaigning for George,\" he confirmed to the Guardian. \"There are other Tories who have been campaigning too because we have had enough of the other parties.\" Khan, you might recall, was one of five people jailed in September 2010 in connection with a failed postal-vote scam in Bradford West ahead of the 2005 general election, when he was found to have multiple voters registered at his home and at a derelict house he had co-owned. The convictions were overturned last year on appeal \u2013 as a result, said the CPS, of \"issues with the judge's summing up\". A Galloway spokesman said Khan was just one of many hundreds of people who had delivered leaflets for the campaign. Like we said, a broad church.
