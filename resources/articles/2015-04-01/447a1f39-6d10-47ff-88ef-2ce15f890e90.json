Each month since Jim Murphy became leader of the party in Scotland has brought a clutch of opinion polls indicating that Labour will suffer an apocalyptic event on 7 May. This would reduce them to a rump of dazed survivors north of the border and knock them back to the political equivalent of the Middle Ages. We have yet to see a poll of voting intentions that indicates anything other than abject humiliation, but there is a sense that a slight change in the wind direction, almost imperceptible, may have occurred. Labour activists, previously wearying of surly rejection on the doorsteps of former supporters, have begun to note a slight thaw. \u201cThe anger over our perceived role in the independence referendum seems to have passed,\u201d one told me last week. \u201cThe 7 May election may yet be too early for outright forgiveness to have occurred, but we can at last see the top of the mountain.\u201d Labour in Scotland has been unlucky in that the Westminster election takes place barely eight months since the independence referendum. Some 35% of Labour supporters voted yes on 18 September and three of the party\u2019s traditional fortresses \u2013 Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and Dundee \u2013 were among the four local authorities out of 32 to back independence. The conduct of senior Labour figures such as Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown, Baron Reid of Cardowan and Baron Robertson of Port Ellen was deemed by many in the party to have been a disgrace. Look no further than these figures when seeking the authors of the party\u2019s collapse. Murphy has grown into his role as Labour\u2019s leader since he took control last December. In the early days, it was hard to escape the conclusion that he and his team were deploying the tactics of ugly bastards everywhere in trying to solicit a sympathy winch in a nightclub: hit them with a blizzard of chat-up lines in the hope that one of them will stick. Thus we had a litany of policy announcements such as nationalising ScotRail; outlawing fixed odds betting machines on bookmakers\u2019 premises; and trying to hijack the campaign to thwart the building of a new women\u2019s prison. We\u2019ve had commitments on zero hours contracts and a newfound zeal to increase the living wage despite having sabotaged moves to devolve it to Holyrood. Many of us were expecting him any day to be dragged off by police at an anti-fracking event. But a more measured approach has been observed in recent weeks, evinced by two assured performances by Murphy in the twin Scottish leaders\u2019 debates last Tuesday and Wednesday. Murphy\u2019s angular frame topped by cadaverous facial features can be unnerving at first sight. His left eye-brow, meanwhile, looks as though it is seeking a devolved settlement from the rest of his forehead. He physically towered over Scotland\u2019s two leading political ladies, Nicola Sturgeon and Ruth Davidson and thus ran the constant risk of appearing to patronise them. But he handled this adroitly and was never really bested by the pocket dynamo who is Sturgeon. Not only did he avoid any serious lapses, he kept his temper in check. And in the Wednesday night debate he drew blood by pressing home the figure of \u00a37.6bn, the deficit that the Institute of Fiscal Studies reckons Scotland will face if the SNP achieved its goal of full fiscal autonomy. Of course the IFS figure doesn\u2019t bear close scrutiny: it is using numbers gathered in one year to define Scotland\u2019s economy in perpetuity. It also fails to take into account that by 2020 Scotland\u2019s onshore revenues are predicted to grow by \u00a315bn. It should also be taken into account that the UK\u2019s deficit was \u00a398bn last year and that over the five years to 2014 the UK\u2019s cumulative deficit has been worth more than \u00a3600bn, yet in two of the past four years Scotland\u2019s GDP percentage deficit has been less than the UK\u2019s. Factor in the fact that, in each of the past 34 years, Scotland has paid more tax per person than the rest of the UK and a future without Barnett looks a lot less gloomy. Labour\u2019s Scottish leader also wisely avoided the language of retribution and hostility that has characterised the comment pages of many English newspapers and is still espoused by former Labour grandees such as Lord Foulkes of Cumnock and Brian Wilson. In their attitudes to Scottish independence, these two are like those wretched Japanese soldiers still fighting the last war. Murphy has at least acknowledged why many Labour supporters in Scotland have felt betrayed. Any recovery has to begin with a mea culpa. Sturgeon remains the biggest obstacle to any lasting recovery by Labour. Many former Labour voters now simply invest more trust in her to deliver socially progressive policies than they do in the party they once supported. She also managed to seize the week with this simple tweet to a young female audience member at Wednesday\u2019s debate who had expressed support for Jim Murphy and who had been targeted by some of the SNP\u2019s own cave dwellers on social media. \u201cYou were great on Tuesday night \u2013 strong &amp; articulate. We need more women like you in politics \u2013 regardless of party.\u201d Politics in Scotland now marches to a different beat than that of the old Etonians and Harrovians and their midnight horse-trading in the Westminster gin palace. Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale (who deputises for Murphy in Edinburgh) bring to their debates a degree of respect that is beginning to decontaminate the political atmosphere in Scotland. Labour and Murphy, despite the efforts of their old backwoodsmen, are beginning to get with the picture. Late, late has been their epiphany, but still too late for this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
