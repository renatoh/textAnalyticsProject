In the Middle East the television company ART apparently doubled its coverage, and 3.2m users logged on to the official Wimbledon website, an increase of 77%. Should we be surprised by these so-called facts? Do they mean anything at all? More to the point, is anybody the least bit interested? The answer on all three counts is a resounding \"No!\" Confronted with such figures, the front cover of Darrell Huff's How to Lie with Statistics, illustrated by Mel Calman, comes vividly to mind. Question: \"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Answer: \"45.6% of the time.\" Or to put it another way: Don't be a novelist, my son or daughter, be a statistician. There's much more scope for the imagination. Ah yes, imagination. If there is one medium that has done more to dull our imaginations, and to turn so much of our sport into little more than wallpaper, it is television. We worship at the altar of the moving image, accompanied by a plethora of statistics. It used to be the number of corner kicks and shots on goal, but these days the anoraks are well and truly in charge. So it is that we currently know that Bolton Wanderers have been caught offside 51 times this season, that Fulham have committed 280 fouls, and that only 14 goals have been scored in the Premiership between the 35th and 40th minute compared with 49 in the last five minutes. It is 75% probable that I have misread these statistics anyway, although who cares a single jot. It goes without saying, given current television technology, that we can now see more of what is going on at a football or rugby match, or inside a tennis court, than at any other time in sporting history. But this has come at a heavy price, for it has all but banished fantasy, to say nothing of fancifulness. Test matches from abroad used to be a glorious feast for the imagination when there was only the radio to rely on. News from India was invariably grim, and it was possible to conjure up images of pale-faced, wraith-like English batsmen, stricken with Delhi belly, playing stoically from the crease as the viciously spinning ball spat from the barest and most cracked of pitches, sending up little clouds of dust with every delivery and testing our brave boys to boiling point in front of huge and hostile crowds. Even allowing for a meagre 30 or so minutes of Test-match highlights on Channel 4, the myth of the subcontinent has been dispelled. India pitches look pretty much like anywhere else in the world and, far from an ordeal of unplayable spin, the same one-day inadequacies that afflict our batsmen during the summer are there for all to see again. And now, having played barely any cricket all summer because of the ridiculous Test contracts, which leave batsmen incapable of middling a ball and bowlers bereft of rhythm, the poor dears are starting to complain that they are not getting enough cricket-free days in the winter, and demanding to be consulted about late changes in their touring arrangements. All of a sudden we are reading about \"packed tours\" and \"punishing\" playing schedules, and this from the same players who for years have been whingeing on about inadequate rewards. So what happens? They finally get paid something likely the going sporting rate - in other words, too much - and then they start complaining about having to work too hard. But the difference is that we can see you on television now, lads, and it doesn't look that tough. Furthermore, so the statistics reliably inform, you are playing less. Or is it my imagination?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
