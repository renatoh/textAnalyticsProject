With 15 years' experience in marketing she enjoyed her job as head of brand planning for Virgin Mobile. But after having her first son, Siffre decided that although she wanted to continue to work at a top level, she needed more flexibility in her working hours. \"That type of job can be unforgiving, with long hours, working nights, weekend and trips away \u2013 I had got to the point in my career where I was thinking about how to balance life and work,\" she said. Siffre went freelance, and while working on various projects became pregnant with her second son. After her youngest started nursery she wanted to get back to the office. \"Any business where you are self-employed you spend a lot of time promoting yourself and I found that was eating into the time I wanted to spend with my kids. I wanted a more stable employer but I also wanted to go back into a senior role.\" She approached a recruitment service aimed at skilled part-time workers who helped her find a role as marketing and communications director at Pathology Group, which specialises in placing doctors. She now work a four-day week, starting at 10am so she can take her children to school. \"There is an understanding that there are going to be times when you need to take a call on your day off, but you will get that time back. It isn't any different to being full time,\" she said. \"There is a job to do and a brief to be met. It is about being grown-up about how you achieve that.\" In previous roles Siffre was more reticent about telling colleagues that she was part time. \"I'm sure I found myself coming up with lots of different reasons why I wasn't there, and I have avoided using the word part time, but now I am upfront about saying what I want and making sure that everyone agrees.\" Siffre added: \"There is a lack of awareness that people can make an active choice to work part time at a top level, oddly negative stereotypes do still exist,\" she said. \"It's frustrating and puts people on the back foot, but I want to show it does work \u2013 you can have a senior role and be part time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
