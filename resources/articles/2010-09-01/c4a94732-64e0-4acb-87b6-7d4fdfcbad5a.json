This was his first appearance since rupturing his achilles tendon in March and the crowd gave him a warm welcome. Afterwards he recounted his second-half conversation with the Galaxy head coach, Bruce Arena. \"He came up to me and said, 'How about 10 to 15 minutes?' I was like, 'Well, how about 20 to 25?' He kind of listened to me and we met in the middle.\" At 35 years of age, Goldenballs is still hungry for game time. With all the money and honours and fame that one man could desire, his appetite is not sated. If he never pulls on an England shirt again, it will not be for the want of trying to convince Fabio Capello that his \"too old\" remark was premature. And only a fool would imagine that his principal motivation is to prolong the life of his brand. Beckham may be a shrewd businessman, but he loves football. As much, even, as Wayne Rooney does. You can choose to believe Sir Alex Ferguson's claim before Saturday's match at Goodison Park that the decision to leave Rooney out of his squad was motivated by worries over abuse from the Everton fans. Or you can believe Mike Phelan, his assistant, who remarked afterwards that the decision had been taken because \"Wayne wasn't ready to play\". There is, however, a third possibility. Maybe Ferguson was just fed up with the whole Rooney circus and wanted to rid himself, temporarily, of a tiresome distraction. It is now seven years since Ferguson's irritation with Beckham's celebrity, and in particular with the supposed effect of his pop-singing, clothes-designing wife on his ability to concentrate on the job at hand, reached critical mass. There was a famous occasion when Beckham was given a day off training to look after his young son, who had a tummy bug, only for Ferguson to explode when he discovered that Posh had been photographed that same evening at a fashion show in London. For the crime of being a caring father who believed his wife's career to be as important as his own, Beckham was fined a fortnight's wages \u2013 \u00a350,000 \u2013 and dropped. It is poignant, in the light of recent events, to recall Ferguson's very deliberate praise for Coleen Rooney a couple of years ago. \"She's a clever girl, who is down to earth,\" he said, in words taken by many as a tacit criticism of the flibbertigibbet Victoria Beckham. \"Marriage helps footballers,\" he added. \"It helps them settle down. You know where they are, too.\" Well, maybe. Six years ago Ferguson paid \u00a327m to attract Rooney to Old Trafford and he has certainly had his money's worth from a man who scored 35 goals in all competitionsfor Manchester United last season. This year things have been a little different. Rooney has not been the same player since he was rushed back from an ankle injury to play a Champions League match last May. After a dreadful World Cup he came into the new season looking slimmer and more alert, but his first touch and his long-range shooting have become unreliable, and there has been a dimming of the sense of adventure that was so pronounced in the 16-year-old. His effort is beyond dispute. His focus is not. We know, from various bits of evidence, that he likes a cigarette and a drink. And he seems to get himself into the sort of trouble that dear, old-fashioned Fergie apparently believed could be avoided by getting married. It will be remembered that Beckham had his own little escapade shortly after leaving Old Trafford and moving to Madrid. His wife has said that, in the end, it made their marriage stronger. It certainly never affected his football. And while David Beckham plays on into the second half of his fourth decade, Wayne Rooney has us \u2013 and perhaps his manager, too \u2013 wondering whether he will still be in the game at 30. Political history is lost on the youth of today \"If we could be a little less political, like it was back then,\" Lewis Hamilton mused the other day, casting his mind back to the era in which his great hero Ayrton Senna battled against Alain Prost, \"maybe it would be more exciting for the fans \u2013 who knows, it could be more exciting for everyone.\" Hamilton should read his history books \u2013 or perhaps just have a chat with his patron, Ron Dennis, who will put him straight on the volcanic political struggles of the Senna-Prost era. If he wants further proof, he has only to wait for the release of Senna, Working Title's forthcoming feature film, which includes remarkable film released to the makers by Bernie Ecclestone. Intimate scenes from inside the paddock include footage of drivers' briefings in which the feud between the Brazilian and the Frenchman came to the boil, exacerbated by the bizarre behaviour of Max Mosley's predecessor, Jean-Marie Balestre. The time during which the autocratic Balestre ruled the FIA is to the present situation in the Formula One paddock as the Yalta summit is to your average WI meeting. Let the birds tweet and sportsmen be silent Can somebody explain to me why Dimitri Mascarenhas, who called Geoff Miller, the England selector, a \"complete knob\" and an \"Fing prick\" on his Twitter feed, has not been relieved of the Hampshire captaincy and told that he will never again, in any circumstances, play representative cricket? By fining him \u00a31,000, his county chairman has made the mistake of putting a financial tariff on gross discourtesy. And surely the last word on tweeting came from Martin Johnson, the manager of the England rugby team, who told the Sunday Times: \"I find it strange that people want to tell the world what they're doing at any time of the day. If I had a Twitter account, I would post one message and that would be: 'Mind your own business.'\" A kiss is not just a kiss According to my estimable colleague Daniel Taylor, the methods employed by El-Hadji Diouf to provoke the wrath of the home crowd at Eastlands on Saturday, after Blackburn Rovers had held Manchester City to a draw, included \"kissing his armpits\". Presumably Diouf deems this more acceptable than the bouts of spitting that got him into trouble in the past. It would be nice if it didn't catch on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
