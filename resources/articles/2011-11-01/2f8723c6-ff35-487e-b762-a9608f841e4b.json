I also have two young children and an amazing wife, who since having the first of our kids four years ago has substantially reduced her working hours in order to look after them. At the outset we established this division of labour as a purely financial decision, as I earn more than her. However, she would now like me to reduce my hours so she can step up her own career again (she works in TV too). I totally understand why my wife wants this \u2013 quite reasonably she argues she has done her bit in terms of putting her career on hold. The problem is I always thought I would be open to such an idea, but when it comes to the crunch I realise I have no desire at all to scale back my work. This in turn makes me feel guilty \u2013 there is so much more impetus on fathers to play an active part these days, but I realise I have no inclination to do it. While in theory my employer encourages flexible and part-time working, in reality I fear it's quite different, and that to try and go part-time would permanently damage my career. Added to this, while I adore my kids I worry that I am not cut out for looking after them on my own, or not as good as my wife is at any rate. When I weigh it up, I'm concerned that in the long run we would lose out as a family, as my career would be damaged at a point when budget cuts are hanging over everyone and the future for people in my profession is uncertain enough as it is. I would welcome your thoughts and those of any readers who have found themselves in a similar position. Jeremy says My guess is that your predicament will strike an all too familiar chord with a great many readers. I, too, look forward to hearing their thoughts and experiences. The one thing I'm certain of is that there's no one-size-fits-all solution to this increasingly common and often agonizing dilemma. Not so long ago, there was an almost universal belief that the man's sole responsibility was to provide; that the woman's place was in the home; and that this was ordained by some law of nature and not open to question. It's true that such assumptions averted the need to resolve the sort of problem you and your wife now face; but it was all deeply inequitable. It is painful to realise just how many women were denied the chance to enjoy fulfilling careers \u2013 and what the world may have lost as a result. You must, of course, put the children first; but that doesn't help much. Opinions differ on how much parental time children need \u2013 but it's clear that the quality of that time is at least as important as the amount. If you can afford help, don't automatically shy away from it. Outside help can ease the pressure on both parents; and any residual guilt ensures that the children will certainly get prime parental attention come weekends and holidays. In your own analysis, your noble attempt at objectivity ends up favouring your own instincts rather than your wife's: the larger income, the important future prospects, the fact that she's better than you at looking after the kids. Does your wife agree with this assessment? You need to talk it through together, and very openly. Don't try to get your way by stealth. For every 10 couples, there will probably be 10 slightly different solutions. Agree to an initial approach that seems the least unfair; but also agree to keep talking. Flexibility may be the best safeguard against old-fashioned injustice and subsequent resentment. Readers say \u2022 Look at it as a learning opportunity. You may not be as good at it as your wife, but that doesn't mean you'll be bad at it. CBR1100XX \u2022 You're right that your career is unlikely to continue on the same trajectory if you reduce your working hours but having children is in part about compromise and sacrifices. It's unreasonable to expect either your wife, your children or your employer to somehow provide the solution to this dilemma for you. Show your employer you can still contribute while working flexibly. Show your wife she is more than simply convenient childcare. Show your children they are not just a problem and you do actually like spending time with them. QueenoftheEast \u2022 Do you want the honest truth from an HR professional? If you go part-time or work flexibly it will effect your career prospects. Quite significantly and much more than any woman going part-time. That is not to say that for many women there is not a downside but is it is not judged as harshly. And it depends on the industry as well. In investment banking it can often be instant career death without trial. This is not the view of anyone that works in HR by the way. We have all seen how flexible working not only helps retain key people but gives competitive advantage. But we don't run the company, alas. So what is the solution? It's childcare. Often the right type of nanny or nursery can give you both the opportunity to pursue careers happily. Or one of you can work freelance. Or you can work together setting up your own company. I'm sympathetic but encourage you to think beyond this and help support your wife as well as face those dinosaurs. Someone has to and it helps when it's a man. And think of those children as well and what is best for them. ExBrightonBelle \u2022 Kids under four are hard work, but it is surprising to many men how many women suddenly realise at around that point that they have an extra toddler \u2013 only he's larger, grumpier, less trainable and can be evicted to reduce the workload. Kids around five to 11 are worth sticking around for and require, surprisingly, more input, time and juggling from both parents. The sharing of responsibilities needs to be rethought with the kids' needs as priority, not yours. jentho I've been given a role I did not expect. Should I ask for more pay? I have recently been given line management responsibility for our team assistant. Although my job title already states that I am a manager, line management is a new part of my job and wasn't mentioned to me when I took the position six months ago. I am happy to do it but feel I should get a pay increase to reflect my increased responsibilities. The trouble is, I don't know how much to ask for. Is there an average percentage increase for line management? I am I right to assume increased responsibility should equal an increase in salary? Jeremy says There's certainly no agreed, across-the-board, average increase for taking on line management. And it sounds as if your company doesn't have fixed pay scales for fixed grades either. So while you're perfectly justified in thinking that increased responsibility should lead to an eventual increase in salary, in your case there's clearly nothing immediate or automatic about it. I don't know who informed you of this promotion \u2013 it may not even have been presented as a promotion \u2013 but you clearly didn't have much of a conversation about it. So I suggest your first step is to ask for such a conversation; and not just about your salary. Since this is a new part of your job, you have every right and reason to ask for guidance. Quite often, people are simply thrown into roles that carry management responsibility with no advice or support to help them. That's unfair not just on the individual but also on the managed. You shouldn't have to learn everything the hard way by practising on your team assistant. You need to know what's expected of you, whether any specific training is available, and how you'll be assessed. And that naturally leads you to ask whether your new role, and how you're doing it, will be taken into account when the next salary review is due. The fact that, after only six months, you've been trusted with this new responsibility suggests that you're well regarded. That's good news. So it might seem a bit grasping to campaign for more money before you've even got your mind round the job, let alone having done it for some time. They seem to trust you; I think you should trust them. For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com.
