Angel Cabrera has finally won the big tournament he has long threatened to do when he took the Benson &amp; Hedges International Open yesterday. The Argentinian, one of the longest hitters in world golf, found that a final round of 69, three under par, for a 10-under-par total of 278, was good enough to beat the overnight leader, Barry Lane, by one shot. Michael Campbell of New Zealand, Padraig Harrington and a furiously frustrated Colin Montgomerie were jointly third on eight under. Cabrera, enormously talented but without an overseas win, collected \u00a3183,330 to add to the \u00a32.5m he has earned in his previous six seasons on the European Tour, whereas Lane, who has laboured on the tour for no fewer than 21 years, won \u00a3122,220, more than he won in each of the seasons 1996-2000. Cabrera was the last man standing in what turned out to be a six-man shoot-out over the final holes. With the last group on the 15th, one shot covered six players: Cabrera, Lane, Harrington and Montgomerie were all nine under, Peter Baker and Michael Campbell both eight under. Harrington was the sentimental favourite, having been disqualified from this event two years ago when he was leading by five after three rounds. It was discovered that he had not signed his first-round card, and had to go. Yesterday he had a 10-foot birdie putt at the 17th that had to go in, and didn't, and he then three-putted the 18th for good measure. Montgomerie had taken six at what yesterday was a tiddler of a 10th hole, only 261 yards, and he did so after laying up. His second ran through the green, his third ran off the green and he eventually holed a 10-footer for his double bogey. He then birdied four of the next seven holes before something he heard put him off. This time it was not the rustle of a plastic bag, or someone breathing, it was an announcer on the 18th green, 473 yards away, greeting Nick Faldo. Disturbed, he whistled his tee shot miles right and the bogey left him seething. \"That 10th,\" he said afterwards. \"I laid up every day and I played it three over for the week. That's the tournament, there and then.\" Lane had the last chances, but he hit an awful second shot to the 16th, leaving the ball on the lower left-hand side of the green with the pin top right. It was three-putt territory and he duly took them, missing from 10 feet short. Now he had to birdie the long 17th, but with a swing much faster than normal he hit his tee shot deep into the trees on the right and did well from there to par the hole. Cabrera, on the other hand, hit two fine shots into that green, safely two-putted and, although he missed the 18th green, a fine chip to two feet took care of that. \"This,\" he said afterwards, \"is the start of great things for me\" - and it is impossible to disagree. Michael Hoey, last year's Amateur champion, completed his first European Tour event with a 72, leaving him on level-par 288. As he had started the tournament with four successive fives, three of which were bogies, he could be - and indeed was - pleased overall. \"If someone at the start had offered me level par for four rounds on this course,\" he said, \"I'd have taken it.\" Not that he did not think his score could have been improved upon. \"I found myself getting mentally exhausted,\" he said, \"and then my concentration slipped. But that's something you've just got to learn, along with keeping the head on when things don't go just right.\" Phillip Price felt that things went a little wrong when his caddie, Andy Prodger, was poached by Colin Montgomerie. He thought he should have been told, and it is arguable that Prodge the Trudge, as Andy is known, should have broken the news to him. But caddies live in a world where they accept peremptory sackings for the most trivial of offences, and who could possibly blame Prodger, offered the opportunity to make mega amounts of money with Montgomerie, for falling over himself, and possibly protocol, by accepting with alacrity. John Daly, who specialises in the extraordinary in all things, produced a round to match yesterday. He had eight birdies, six bogies and only four pars in his round of 70, to finish only four behind the winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
