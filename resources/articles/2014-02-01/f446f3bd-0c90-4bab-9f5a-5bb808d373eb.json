Parisian butchers roast rare-breed chickens on sidewalks in a bid to entice customers. In the open-air food courts of south-east Asia, roast chicken rice is now as commonplace as the traditional poached chicken rice. And what of Australia\u2019s love of roast chook and the countless families that have gathered around an avian centrepiece with all the trimmings? For Rockpool owner Neil Perry, a child of the \u201960s, roast chook was a Sunday family tradition. \u201cMy father loved growing pumpkin so there was usually that as well as white sweet potatoes,\u201d says Perry. \u201cDad also used to make a mayo salad dressing out of condensed milk that us kids went mad for.\u201d Among the decade\u2019s many notable events, the rise of freezing technology helped make roast chicken accessible to families around the country \u2013 or, to quote a memorable piece of advertising, \u201cto make it Sunday, every day\u201d. In One Continuous Picnic, Australian food historian Michael Symons writes: \u201cAccording to Retail World, in 1978 the relative sales of frozen foods went something like this: poultry $200m, ice-cream $140m.\u201d The chicken hasn\u2019t crossed back over the road since. According to the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, the billion tonnes of chicken meat produced annually in Australia is worth an estimated $4.5bn to the industry. Four decades ago, the average Australian ate 4.2kg of chicken a year. Today, each of us consumes 45kg of chook with Aussies getting their fix at supermarkets, suburban delis and restaurants both takeaway and high-end. Perry, for instance, offers exemplary wood-fire rotisserie specimens at all three of his Rockpool Bar &amp; Grills. At Bistro Guillaume in Melbourne and Perth, roast chicken is one of a handful of share-friendly main plates. During Dan Hunter\u2019s tenure at Dunkeld\u2019s Royal Mail Hotel \u2013 Hunter is now at Brae, his new digs in Birregurra \u2013 the jointed bird enjoyed in the bistro was as rewarding as the restaurant\u2019s feted tasting menu, albeit for different reasons. \u201cFossilised\u201d Jerusalem artichokes filled with brie are all well and good, but there\u2019s something primal and comforting about succulent, rosy flesh and the crackle of perfectly crisp skin. Despite the spike in restaurant sightings, roast chicken remains, as far as my stomach is concerned, a home-cooked treat. The lion\u2019s share of my chicken dinners come care of my mother and her turbo broiler \u2013 a portable, compact oven that unfailingly produced crisp-skinned, juicy birds (and fewer dishes for the Veenhuyzen boys to wash). While I\u2019m yet to add a turbo broiler to my own kitchen arsenal, mum\u2019s secret to crisp chicken skin \u2013 leaving your chook uncovered in the fridge for a few hours dries the skin out wonderfully \u2013 has been a go-to since I fled the nest. It\u2019s also perhaps the only piece of cooking advice I dare offer when discussing a dish irrevocably tied to family, Sunday best memories and ovens of varying levels of technological fanciness. Although the Blumenthals of the world might advocate \u201coff-piste\u201d multi-stage cooking, I \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 continue to place my faith in constant temperature (180C) and basting (butter!), metal skewers in leg joints and noses pressed against oven doors. When he\u2019s not trussing birds on rotisseries, Perry butterflies his chicken, roasts it with thyme, lemon and garlic, and sets his sights on juicy breast meat. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to sear the inside of the legs than it is to breathe life back into overcooked breast,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re roasting chicken in an oven, cooking it at about 200C for 20 minutes gives it good colour and gets the juices flowing. After that, turn it down to 130C for about 30 minutes, then rest for 10 minutes with foil and tea towels over the roasting dish. I always serve it with peas.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
