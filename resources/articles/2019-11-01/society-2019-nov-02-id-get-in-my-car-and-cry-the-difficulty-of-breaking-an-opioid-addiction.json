She is just one of hundreds of patients who have been seen by the cognitive behavioural therapist Michael Ritchie since the alcohol and drug charity began offering its services to people experiencing issues with the drugs five years ago. The medication\u2019s ability to block both physical and mental pain means that in many instances, patients who develop addictions have \u201cunderlying emotional issues\u201d, said Ritchie, and need tailored counselling as well as medical advice to withdraw. \u201cThey\u2019re prescribed opioids for legitimate pain but it makes them feel better than they have in years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need more to get the same effect, so they start using more and more until their life revolves around their medication.\u201d Sessions are weekly and one-on-one. After an initial meeting, if Ritchie thinks mental health issues are fuelling a patient\u2019s addiction, he will provide counselling as well as advice to their doctor about how to safely taper them off the drugs. The service, which is mostly funded by Bradford council, is running at capacity \u2013 treating about 70 patients \u2013 although there is an \u201cenormous demand\u201d. The charity\u2019s chief executive, Jon Royle, said providing treatment across five GP surgeries rather than at their city centre clinic was key to the Bridge Project\u2019s popularity, because people \u201cwon\u2019t come to addiction treatment centres\u201d. \u201cThey have got this problem in primary care. They don\u2019t want to be stigmatised as drug addicts,\u201d he said. Proof of the method\u2019s success is Bedford, who had become hooked on the co-codamol \u2013 a mixture of codeine and paracetamol \u2013 she was sent home with from hospital. The first hit made her feel like \u201cthe walls had turned pink and I was laid on bubble wrap\u201d. She added: \u201cAfter that, I wanted to constantly be in that place.\u201d As a result of her addiction, she became a recluse, skipping sixth form and losing jobs throughout her formative years, while ongoing surgeries meant it was easy for her to acquire more painkillers through her GP\u2019s online repeat prescription service. By last October, she had increased her daily intake to 24 tablets \u2013 three times the recommended limit. It was only the threat of crashing her car while driving loved ones that prompted Bedford to visit the West Yorkshire service for help. But it is not just sedative side-effects that can endanger the lives of opioid painkiller addicts. Sarah*, another service user, became addicted to co-codamol after experiencing a \u201ceuphoric\u201d side-effect after wrist surgery and began taking above the recommended limit. When doctors wised up to her excuses for requiring an early prescription, she topped up with ibuprofen and paracetamol from a pharmacy, but was taken to hospital for an overdose after taking 128 tablets in one day. Through counselling with Ritchie, both women discovered the link between their addictions and unearthed trauma \u2013 such as Sarah\u2019s emotionally abusive relationship and the death of Bedford\u2019s dad from pancreatic cancer. \u201cSome days I left the sessions and I was so drained and exhausted by these feelings and I\u2019d get in my car and cry. But I\u2019d go home with a smile on my face,\u201d said Bedford, who by late November was opioid-free. Both women have been clean for months and continue to see Ritchie occasionally. They are offering to help run a support group so that the charity can help more people suffering with opioid painkiller addiction. In January, Bedford will be operated on for endometriosis. She is concerned about having to take opioid painkillers again, but remains optimistic that support from the Bridge Project will see her through. Although he is proud of the work Bridge has achieved, Ritchie stressed that local authority cuts to drug and alcohol treatment meant their workforce had halved while their caseload had doubled in two years. Royle added: \u201cWe\u2019re sort of pioneers in many ways, because we\u2019ve started something. But we\u2019ve just scratched the tip of the iceberg. We\u2019re in a small corner of the country; what about the rest of the country where they\u2019re not getting help?\u201d * Name changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
