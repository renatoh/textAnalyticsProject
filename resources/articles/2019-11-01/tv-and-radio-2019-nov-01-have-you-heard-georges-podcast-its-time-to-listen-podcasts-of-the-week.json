It's time to listen! \u2013 podcasts of the week", "bodyText": "Talking points Spoken word artist and writer George the Poet cleaned up at this year\u2019s British Podcast Awards, scooping five gongs including Podcast of the Year. His hit show \u2013 Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast? \u2013 is an exploration of community and identity via music and poetry. The first series touches on Grenfell, migrants and the creative process, with space for humour and experimentalism. It returns on 4 November on BBC Sounds. Elsewhere, Esther Perel \u2013 host of acclaimed couples therapy podcast Where Should We Begin? \u2013 is set to launch a new series about work. How\u2019s Work will be released on 5 November on Spotify, with Perel transferring her knack for working out relationship woes to the thorny world of the workplace. Picks of the week Tom Neenan Is Not All Men The Mash Report\u2019s Tom Neenan is here with a podcast to end social injustice because he is, as he constantly reminds his listeners, one of the good guys. For the first episode of this satirical podcast, he tackles feminism. Like a millennial Alan Partridge, he\u2019s adept at playing the try-hard fool as he struggles to explain just how feminist he is. There\u2019s a backdrop of an eye-rolling ex-girlfriend and a long-suffering producer barely tolerating him as he asks women who their favourite feminists are and addresses the gender pay gap. Hannah Verdier The Orbiting Human Circus in Naughty Till New Years Crackly, surreal and laced in offbeat humour, this podcast from WNYC/Night Vale Presents returns for its second season on 6 November, complete with John Cameron Mitchell and Tim Robbins. Neutral Milk Hotel\u2019s Julian Koster is the janitor who\u2019s still trying to gatecrash the variety show that broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower\u2019s ballroom. The circus is a place of many attractions, including \u201cbovine cannonballs\u201d, wistful songs and the promise of a musical flea. No other podcast sounds like this. HV Guardian pick: Today In Focus \u2013 The women who broke the Harvey Weinstein story In 2017, the New York Times broke the story of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s decades-long abuse of power. The journalists behind the investigation \u2013 Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey \u2013 joined Rachel Humphreys this week on Today in Focus. In a fascinating episode, the pair reveal how they convinced actors and former employees to come forward, and the lengths the Hollywood producer was willing to go to prevent the story from breaking. They also recall how shocked they were that their reporting led to a global reckoning on sexual harassment, and the #MeToo movement. Max Sanderson Listener pick: Slow Burn Chosen by the Guardian audio team \u201cSometime before the cops arrive and before Biggie and Chico got down to the lobby, Tupac made it on to an elevator that was going up. He rode up to the eighth floor then dragged himself to the studio where he was supposed to meet with Shawn \u2026 he made it into a chair and used paper towels to try and stop the bleeding\u201d. In the new series of Slow Burn, Joel Anderson describes in vivid detail the events surrounding the shooting of Tupac Shakur\u2019 at the Quad Recording Studios in 1994. After the departure of writer and presenter Leon Neyfakh at the end of series two, the show has deviated from revisiting presidential scandals (series one took on Watergate while series two focused on the impeachment of Clinton) to look at the murder of two of the world\u2019s most influential music artists \u2013 Tupac Shakur and the Notorious BIG. But this is not a eulogy; in the opening lines, Anderson reminds us that on the night of his shooting, Shakur was on trial for sexual assault. Episode one fuses feuds, legal battles and brash masculinity \u2013 all the expected ingredients of any good hip-hop story. But it\u2019s the moments with Tupac himself that indicate unexpected and wider reaching resonance. The connection between hip-hop and politics has long demanded a more in-depth look. Slow Burn looks set to deliver that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
