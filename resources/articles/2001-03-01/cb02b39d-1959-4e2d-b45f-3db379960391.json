Chief executive John Coleman said: \"Consolidation would still be a good thing. We are about as small as you can be [to operate efficiently] and there are lots of smaller players out there who cannot afford the investment in a systems and supply chain that we've put in over the last five years. There would be significant costs you could take out. We could support another 20 or 30 stores.\" House of Fraser was \"an obvious leader\" for consolidation in the sector, but it was not talking to any rival groups: \"We don't think there is any rush because we see ourselves getting stronger.\" His comments came as House of Fraser, which is Britain's third-biggest department store chain, posted full-year profits of \u00a317.8m, up from \u00a317m last year. The advance would have been stronger but for a mandatory tax change, which lopped \u00a32.4m off the bottom line, and a \u00a34.5m \"disruption cost\" caused by revamps at the group's Guildford and Oxford Street stores. The \u00a345m makeovers closed Guildford for most of the year and left one floor out of action in Oxford Street for the bulk of the year. A further \u00a327m was spent upgrading other stores. \"It was a big year for capital spend,\" Mr Coleman admitted. This year he is turning his attention to upgrading the Birmingham store, which will soon face stiff competition from a new Selfridges, and opening five new stores before 2003. He is also seeking more store locations and hopes to announce three or four shortly. House of Fraser, which now likes to dub itself the country's leading designer brand retailer, is constantly on the lookout for new labels to pull in shoppers, from luxury goods such as Fendi to young fashion brands like Porn Star and Playboy. Like-for-like sales were up 5.6% in the first eight weeks of the new financial year, although the revamps are paying bigger dividends. Sales at the Oxford Street store were up 77.5% on 2000 levels. Yesterday, the under-performing shares climbed 8p to a 12-month high of 72.5p. Nevertheless, many analysts remain unconvinced about the potential of the group, which has sold freeholds to finance investment and whose earnings do not cover its dividend this year. Mr Coleman hit out at those analysts, saying the majority only thought about his company \"for five minutes every six months\" and that was not enough to \"understand complex businesses like this\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
