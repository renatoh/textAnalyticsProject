In textbook style, Mourinho has gone on the offensive in the buildup to the most eagerly anticipated match of the season, in which Manchester United will try to close the eight-point gap between themselves and Pep Guardiola\u2019s league leaders. City have received plaudits for the dazzling style with which they have stormed to top spot, winning 14 and drawing one of their opening 15 fixtures, scoring 46 goals and conceding just 10 in the process. Mourinho was also complimentary of the leaders as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s encounter but could not help aiming yet another slight in their direction, having also accused City of diving. \u201cThey attack with a lot of players and when they lose the ball, they are many times unbalanced in numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have lots of people surrounding the ball area and they have a very strong \u2013 and this is a great quality \u2013 transition in the next few seconds after they lose the ball and many times, they need what is called a tactical foul. Then it is up to the referee to analyse and to make a decision, but I cannot speak about that.\u201d City have received 27 yellow cards this season, the joint third-highest in the division and six more than United. Guardiola\u2019s team has also received two red cards \u2013 one more than United. That one United red was shown to Paul Pogba during the 3-1 victory over Arsenal last Saturday and rules the Frenchman out of the derby. His absence is a significant blow for United and one that drastically alters how the team can and will perform, according to Mourinho. \u201cWe lost a very important player for us, a player with an impact in the way we play and that is obvious,\u201d he said. Referring to Pogba\u2019s injury lay-off from 12 September to 18 November, he added: \u201cThere was a Manchester United with Paul, there was a Manchester United without Paul and we have another Manchester United with Paul. He is a player that has an impact in our style of play. That is obvious and now for the next three matches we have to cope without Paul and we have to try and win matches without Paul. It\u2019s not pessimistic. It\u2019s just a different way to play. \u201cDo you think I have in my team a midfield player who can make the third goal at Arsenal? We don\u2019t have. They do other things, they have other qualities. [Marouane] Fellaini can score an amazing header, [Nemanja] Matic can shoot from outside the box, [Ander] Herrera can do other good things, but a midfield player to do and create what Pogba did in the third goal against Arsenal, as an example, we don\u2019t have.\u201d Zlatan Ibrahimovic is available to face City although, according to his manager, \u201cnot ready to play 90 minutes\u201d as he is still in the process of recovering from a long-term knee injury. For City, David Silva should feature having got over a muscular problem that ruled him out of the midweek defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Both teams go into the match in excellent form and there will hope among the chasing pack that United can extend their unbeaten home record in all competitions to 41 matches in order to stop the title race becoming a foregone conclusion. According to Mourinho, however, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham should not be relying on his side to do them a favour. \u201cEvery team is a different team, as every manager thinks a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should look to us or wait for us to find a magical potion, not at all.\u201d Guardiola has claimed his relationship with Mourinho \u2013 an adversary from their days managing Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively \u2013 is \u201cmuch better\u201d but insisted the pair will never share the same principles in regards to how football should be played. \u201cThe way we see the game is different \u2013 that\u2019s normal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we love to compete. We love to win games. But it\u2019s not a special situation when we beat a Mourinho team. I want to win but I am a sportsman. When I lose, I accept the defeat and I try to learn from that and move on. \u201cI respect a lot of my colleagues, Jos\u00e9 as well. He knows and I know we want to beat each other. Sunday will not be an exception for that. But at the end, what happened on the pitch is on the pitch and after that, it\u2019s over.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
