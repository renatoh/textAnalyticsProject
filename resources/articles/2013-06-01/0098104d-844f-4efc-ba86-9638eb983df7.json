Good to see so many of you firing up on the comments on the blog; and others keeping in touch on Twitter. As no-one has said anything foolish that I know about for some period of time, let's do the evening summary. Today in federal politics: The day opened with another poor opinion poll for the ALP and for Julia Gillard, with the primary vote dipping below 30 per cent. It was a better poll for Kevin Rudd - as it showed he was more popular than the Prime Minister, and could get Labor back within striking distance in September. Pollster John Stirton however warned this represented a \"magical scenario\" where there was a leadership change with no side-effects and no consequences. The same poll showed voters liked former Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull more than Tony Abbott - perhaps confirming a distinct pox on all your leaders mood in the community - although of course the data showed the Coalition would win any election held today by a considerable margin. Leadership speculation trickled through the political day. The government continued to press for more states to sign on to the Gonski education reforms. The Coalition was mostly concerned with cost of living and the carbon tax in Question Time. Liberal backbencher Judi Moylan began the valedictories of this session with a classy farewell speech which articulated the values of her lengthy political career. The cross benchers reflected on their experience of the minority parliament in interviews with Guardian Australia - and a few of them: Bob Katter, Nick Xenophon and Andrew Wilkie, also flexed a bit of rhetorical muscle on the subject of the excessive market power of supermarkets. With parliament entering its final two weeks, the government more or less confirmed this afternoon that it would drop the final element of its battered and broken media package - its plan to scrap the reach rule (which is relevant for TV mergers being proposed at the present time.) Thanks muchly to Mike Bowers and the Sydney team, particularly Madhvi Pankhania and Mary Hamilton, and also Christian Bennett. Have a lovely evening. See you tomorrow. We are heading towards our close this evening, but for those of you who like to keep close track of parliamentary proceedings, there will be a debate in the Federation Chamber tonight at around 6.30pm on a bill from Green MP Adam Bandt to legalise same sex marriage. Speakers tonight include two Labor Cabinet ministers - Stephen Smith and Greg Combet - both of whom support gay marriage. The motion passed in the senate has no impact on the Madigan bill either way - but it is interesting. The Opposition leader last week ruled out any deals with the pro-life senator Madigan after the September election; and said he planned no changes to abortion law. Abortion was actually raised as an issue by the Prime Minister last week - fighting words about how only Labor could protect women's reproductive rights. But Labor is yet to specify a formal position on the Madigan bill. A formulation on the proposal has been issued by a spokesman for the Health Minister Tanya Plibersek - but there's no clear position. If the Madigan bill ever came to a vote, Labor's national executive would have to allow a conscience vote on the question. I spoke to union boss Joe De Bruyn - National Secretary and Treasurer of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association - about this last week. De Bruyn's union is conservative on these questions, and he's an important figure in the Labor Right. He told me in a conversation last week there would be a conscience vote, no question. He declined to be drawn on the wisdom of the Prime Minister raising the abortion issue. De Bruyn: I don't want to comment on what the Prime Minister has said. While I was chasing the fate of the reach rule, going .. going .. the senate has passed a motion expressing concern about gender selection abortions. This motion relates to a private members bill from the Democratic Labor Party Senator John Madigan which aims to take away Medicare funding for terminations allegedly performed on the basis of gender. Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon is deeply cross that this has happened. The Greens opposed the motion. It passed with the support of Labor and the Coalition. Senator Rhiannon: The Australian Greens condemn sex-selective abortion where it does occur and we stand squarely behind the recommendations from the UN Conferences at Cairo and Beijing but we will not support a motion that is more about pushing Senator Madigan\u2019s anti-abortion barrow than addressing women\u2019s inequality. It is a shame that the Labor party could not stand up to this Trojan horse motion. Senator Madigan\u2019s motion was misleading in that it stated that various UN agencies have called for \u2018urgent steps\u2019 to address gender-biased sex selection. There has been no such call. With parliament entering its final fortnight, I've been chasing the fate of the last remaining element of the Gillard Government's media reforms. Readers who follow politics closely will know that most of the government's package to reform the media, including new enhanced powers for the Press Council to poilce newspapers and digital sites, collapsed earlier this year. We've been waiting to hear whether or not the government will scrap the so-called reach rule which stops a TV licence holder from reaching more than 75 \u2009per cent of the population. The rule is relevant to the fate of some current media mergers being proposed. We expect a committee report later this week recommending that the rule be scrapped. But too late. It looks like it's game over in any case. There won't be time to deal with this before parliament concludes. Here's a statement from a spokesman for the Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy. The government awaits the parliamentary committee's report, but there are no plans to introduce legislation to repeal the 75 per cent reach rule in this sitting of parliament. If opinion polls are correct - issues like the market power of supermarkets will assume greater importance and prominence after the election than perhaps they have in the lead-up. Bob Katter and Nick Xenophon have pursued issues like divestiture powers (powers for competition authorities to break up businesses when they get too big) over many years. Katter is pursuing legislation that would bust up the supermarkets (his words). If the balance of power changes in the Senate, there will be more options to pursue reforms in this space. The Nationals are also concerned about market power and have been for many years - a fact which sometimes causes friction between the Liberal Party and their junior coalition partner. I know some Liberals are concerned about the outlook for competition policy after September if Tony Abbott wins on September 14. The Liberals are not great fans of divestiture, historically. A quick race back. A press conference by Bob Katter, Nick Xenophon and Andrew Wilkie highlighting their concerns about the excessive market power of Australia's supermarkets got crunched in the sprint to Question Time. If you are interested in this issue, here's some video so you can review what they all said. Thanks to Christian Bennett. Last week was certainly a low point in Australia's political discussion. The Prime Minister copped it from within and without for raising gender issues, abortion and sexism in a speech to a function for progressive women. Then events caught up with the speech. We had a lewd menu associated with a political fundraiser in Brisbane - then Perth broadcaster Howard Sattler asking Gillard whether her partner, Tim Mathieson was gay. Then there was another silly moment on the ABC's Insiders program. People are still pondering the impact of last week. Ben Eltham is pondering it - he has written for us here at Guardian Australia today. Eltham says recent events suggest some men find a lady in The Lodge confronting - he thinks they find it a threat to their identity. Here's an excerpt: The truth is that many men find gender discussions uncomfortable. They find them uncomfortable because they threaten male power. The most anti-Gillard segment of the community is older white males \u2013 precisely the most privileged demographic in Australian society. For men like Alan Jones, Andrew Bolt and Howard Sattler, it really does appear as though a female prime minister threatens their sense of identity. Perhaps that's why Jones seems incapable of stopping himself referring to the prime minister as \u201cthis woman.\u201d Andrew Bolt prefers a more subtle power dynamic: he likes to call Gillard a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d. You can find the full piece here. If you have thoughts, feel free to share either here, or on Twitter. The Prime Minister has placed further questions on the notice paper. And here's the government. A very cheerful Mike Kelly at the top, and a very intense Greg Combet down the bottom of the frame. While the Manager of Government Business, Anthony Albanese, is up at the dispatch box with a morale booster for the Labor backbench, Mike Bowers has prepared a little something for the amusement of #politicslive readers. Blue ties, a collage. First. The Opposition. Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop is onto asylum boats. Does the Prime Minister now accept that Kevin Rudd's change of policy was a mistake? (Bishop means the dismantling of the Howard deterrence policies.) The Prime Minister says the Coalition is not into the world of facts, it constructs alternate realities to suit its political agenda. We have been guided by the experts, Gillard says. What we've hit in this parliament is the relentless negativity of the Opposition. Gillard is now attacking the Coalition's tow back policy - she cites comments from Indonesia and comments from defence personnel about how the policy won't work. She cites new comments this morning. Fomer Defence Force chief, Chris Barrie, said this on towing back the boats this morning: It\u2019s filthy, dirty work for the Navy. Of course it\u2019s traditional. Let\u2019s go back to 2001, the few boats we did manage to get back needed to be made seaworthy, needed to be fitted out with appropriate lifesaving equipment \u2013 they didn\u2019t arrive with that, these boats were coming on one-way trips. The engines had to be rebuilt because they were destroyed as soon as those boats sighted one of our vessels. No-one on board had any papers, we\u2019re in a cleft stick here. Furthermore, sometimes the health of people on board wasn\u2019t sufficient to enable a tow-back. You put all that into the equation and ask yourself, what are asylum seeker boats going to do \u2013 if this is the policy \u2013 when they sight one of our vessels on the high seas? I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more of sinking of the boats and other issues and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really fair on our people who have to go out and do this job. The Prime Minister accuses Pyne of peddling false figures. Pyne objects and wants that description withdrawn. The Prime Minister objects back. She's now back to the Liberal Party, putting children last. Manager of Opposition Business and Shadow Education Minister Christopher Pyne is up asking a question on financing - he speaks of $4.7 billion in cuts over the next four years. The Prime Minister contends this is Pyne's second question on education in this parliament. There is so much hollering that Speaker Anna Burke rises to her feet. Schools Minister Peter Garrett is up with another question on the Gonski package. Garrett would like the Victorian premier to follow the lead of the South Australian premier and stand up for students in his state. Shadow Finance Minister Andrew Robb has a question about an investment in a wind farm and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Is it proper to use borrowed money to outbid commercial banks? The Prime Minister says the Opposition is insulting the CEFC with this question. She says the CEFC works within Australian law. Gillard says when the Opposiotion raises this and other matters, this is an issue of sovereign risk. Mike Bowers notes that Peter Slipper is neither blue tie, nor red, tie, nor pink tie, today. Bit of everything. Treasurer Wayne Swan, meanwhile, is shouting at the Opposition for trash talking the economy. Sorry - bit of a technical hop there. Independent Peter Slipper has just concluded a question about the indexation of military pensions. The response from the Veterans Affairs Minister Warren Snowdon? We know there's an issue in the community, we are speaking to the Finance Department, watch this space. Labor opens the Dorothy Dixers today on schools and school funding. Putting kiddies first and politics second. This is about getting the Gonski package done. Nationals leader Warren Truss is back, meanwhile, on the carbon tax. Why are you making the carbon tax bigger by introducing one on heavy vehicles from 1 July 2014? The Prime MInister: I certainly won't be taking any lectures on facts and carbon pricing from the Opposition. The Prime Minister says this change has always been part of the package. If you believe in the science of climate change, you take policy actions to try and prevent warming, is Gillard's argument. We've implemented a market-based mechanism. Tony Abbott has a supplementary. If you always deal in facts, why did you say just before the 2010 election that there would be no carbon tax under the government I lead? Gillard: I refer the leader of the Opposition to the statements I made during the election campaign in support of an emissions trading scheme. The Oppositon leader Tony Abbott opens on cost of living. Is the Prime Minister aware that power bills have gone up more under her than during the entire Howard period? The Prime Minister says she's glad of that question. She can get to the heart of this matter, which is about gold plating, Julia Gillard says. Gold plating in the states, over investment in poles and wires. That's what's driving up power prices. Tony Abbott is back with a supplementary. Can the Prime Minister confirm that two-thirds of the increase is due to the carbon tax? The Prime Minister says the government told voters prices would go up, and compensation was provided. She's speaking of Abbott's claims about astronomical price rises associated with the clean energy package. Ridiculous, mendacious claims from the Opposition leader. Bob's back. This time he's with Independents Andrew Wilkie and Nick Xenophon. This press conference is about supermarkets having too much market power. Supermarkets are like a giant monster gobbling up businesses around the country, Katter says. Senator Xenophon isn't into monsters - he's into divestiture. More competition, he says, would good for the consumer. Now, I'd better make my pivot for Question Time. See you in a few minutes. Meanwhile, out in one of the parliamentary courtyards, Katter's Australia Party leader Bob Katter is warning that someone (I didn't quite catch who, I'm terribly sorry) is facing a locomotive coming down the tunnel. Katter: Do not allow a collapse. Provide a soft landing so there are no implications for the Australian economy. Then he walked away from his press conference. I believe there's a division in the House of Representatives. I think we'd all feel more comfortable if Martin Ferguson - the retiring Member for Batman - unclenched his fist. Fergsuon is pictured here with Resources Minister Gary Gray. Come on down. Jazz hands? Kevin Rudd in the chamber just now. Because too many polls are never enough. Today's Essential poll is better for Labor than Nielsen. But the Coalition still wins. By a lot. Just a few more grabs from Judi Moylan's farewell. It seems appropriate to reflect, even just briefly, on the glorious responsibility of politics. I cannot help reflecting that as legislators, the members of this House exercise a glorious responsibility. It is no small thing to contrive, consider and ultimately create new law for a great nation. It is no small thing to rigorously uphold the separation of powers that tempers the potential excesses of executive government. Equally it is no small thing to defend the sanctity of free speech \u2013 especially in that essential organ of democracy, the fourth estate. Let's take stock while we all enhance Australia's national productivity by enjoying our victuals el desko. Federal politics, this lunchtime: The chambers have resumed for the final sitting fortnight of the 43rd parliament before the September poll. A new Nielsen poll published by Fairfax Media this morning was grim news for Labor and the Prime Minister, with Labor's primary vote dropping back below 30 per cent. The poll confirmed that Kevin Rudd was more likely than Julia Gillard to put Labor back in contention. The data indicated that Rudd would lead Labor not to an electoral wipe-out but to a likely hung parliament. Pollster John Stirton cautioned his numbers were a \"magical scenario\" - that they did not take account of any practical impacts of any leadership change. Speculation continues whether the Prime Minister will retain the current level of support she has within her core leadership group - and about any mechanism Kevin Rudd might use to make a renewed case for the leadership. Protagonists are giving ritualised sound bite responses to these questions; and TV cameras and reporters are swarming the place looking for any break in the standard formulations. Liberal backbencher Judi Moylan has, meanwhile, said farewell to politics with a terrific speech that you'd hope might make politics focus on what it's actually about - (but you wouldn't hold your breath on that one.) The Opposition leader has been meeting notable pinot noir man and Nobel prize laureate Brian Schmidt concerning research funding. Let's flick over to the chamber for a moment. Liberal backbencher Judi Moylan, the Member for Pearce, is giving her valedictory speech. Moylan will retire at this election. Moylan, a Liberal moderate, has been a great contributor in this place. Moylan: As one leaves the stage of active intervention there is inevitably heartache, mostly for issues in our body politic that consistently resist amelioration. Such as? Poverty. Why have we not been able to do better? Privatisation? Is it always the answer to the efficient delivery of services? The level playing field? Another mantra. (Moylan's point is why don't we protect our producers more effectively? Why do we just give into the orthodoxies of economic savants?) Moylan says she's witnessed the extraordinary rise of China. Our trade relationship she says, will require sophistication; and also an eye to the Indian Ocean. Refugees? This is not a situation Australia can manage in isolation. If we are committed to stopping the deaths at sea, in this most intransigent of political arenas, our Parliament must find a way to forge a national consensus on this matter before we can possibly entertain any hope of achieving a regional consensus. That is the only way we will find a lasting and humane resolution to one of the enduring human horrors of war and civil strife in our midst and my feelings on this matter have been expressed frequently both within this Chamber and without. I remain stridently opposed to indefinite mandatory detention and the continued detention of children, 2,000 of whom are currently in detention. These practices have gone on in our name and will stand as a matter of great shame. On politics? I thank the House for the numberless courtesies extended to me since my election in March 1993. In politics, the mind and the heart must move as one, otherwise chaos ensues. The Liberal Party, Moylan says, has never failed her. She says the party's decision to allow members free votes on important distinguishes it from other players. She thanks the House, and there is warm applause. Mike Bowers bumped into former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer a little while ago on his way into the building. A brief chat established that Fischer was on his way to see Kevin Rudd after Question Time. A quick check with Rudd's office confirms Fischer has a 3pm with the former PM. He's going in with Marie Harga, executive director of a group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust. They will have a chat about food security, an issue Rudd took a close interest in while Foreign Minister. Now here's a familiar hat for folks who have watched federal politics for a long time. For the record? I'll miss this parliament when it's gone. Mad perhaps, but it has been a real privilege to have a ringside seat in one of the most interesting periods that I've covered in national affairs. Polls suggest I'm in a minority of one with that thought, but perverse or not, that's my view. Now speaking of polls, let's double back for a moment. I'm still reading through all the pieces from this morning about Labor's leadership woes and the impact of the new opinion polls. Michelle Grattan from The Conversation has looked closely at the position Workplace Minister Bill Shorten currently finds himself in. And Michelle reports an interesting detail about Shorten's wife, Chloe Bryce. Here's Michelle: The poll adds to the enormous pressure on powerbroker Bill Shorten, a Gillard backer who was key in making her PM, and other senior figures in the party, as well as Gillard\u2019s union backers. A shift by Shorten would tip the balance, but last night his spokeswoman reaffirmed he was still supporting Gillard. The leadership crisis is at an impasse with Gillard refusing to countenance stepping down and Rudd refusing to challenge. Shorten is being buffeted by conflicting considerations. As the one most likely to become leader in opposition, he would benefit by Rudd becoming leader now, and saving some of the \u201cfurniture\u201d. Those wanting him to act argue that it is his duty for the good of the party. On the other hand, to be a main player in assassinating two Labor prime ministers in three years would give him an unenviable reputation for disloyalty. (Aaron Patrick\u2019s just published Downfall: How the Labor Party ripped itself apart, describes the decision by Shorten and other senior figures to remove a democratically elected PM in his first term of office as \u201cone of the great political miscalculations of the modern era\u201d.) Often overlooked, too, in the current situation is the role of Shorten\u2019s wife Chloe Bryce, daughter of Governor-General Quentin Bryce. Chloe has recently become president of the board of the newly-formed Women for Gillard group, to whom Gillard gave her speech last week. Her high profile public support for the PM would increase the difficulties of Shorten defecting, if Gillard remains determined to fight for her position. You can read Michelle in full here. In a day of silly walks, this is very much worth your time. As we enter the final phase of the 43rd parliament, here are the reflections of the crossbenchers on how the last three years have gone. NSW Independent, Rob Oakeshott: This parliament has been alive. (That it has.) NSW Independent Tony Windsor: It took a hung parliament to find the resolve to solve the Murray Darling. Tasmania's Andrew Wiklie: Tony Abbott has been very successful in creating an atmosphere of crisis. But (the parliament) has been remarkable stable and remarkably reformist. This is a terrific package from Lenore Taylor, Mike Bowers and Christian Bennett. If you are interested in more particulars about that new Climate Commission report, here's a link to a news story. And if you have the time for the primary source - here's a link to the report, The Critical Decade. The bottomline? Coal and other fossil fuels need to stay in the ground if we are to avoid the worst case scenarios on climate change. The Climate Commission meanwhile is attempting to get its policy message through the fog. Tim Flannery is holding a press conference in Sydney to release a new report we flagged in our wrap of the political news this morning. Flannery says this is the most important of the Climate Comission's reports released to date. One of the authors, Will Steffen, says the report looks at all the evidence to conclude that significant actions are now required to ensure the world acts on an urgent imperative of carbon constraint. Steffen: For the first time the scientific community has connected on all the dots on what this all means. On being way over it, by parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, Andrew Leigh. JOURNALIST: Does it annoy you that people are focused on leadership as opposed to policy at the moment? LEIGH: Of course it does. I mean, I got into parliament in order to make a difference, in order to work on issues like poverty, disadvantage \u2013 I\u2019ve got a book on inequality coming out next month \u2013 those are the issues that get me out of bed in the morning. But I\u2019m of course always happy to come out here and take your questions on any issue. The atmosphere in an image. Mike Bowers, from out on the lawns of the parliament. Meanwhile, the circus at the airport continues. Kevin Rudd has just arrived for today's parliamentary sitting. Here's a grab of audio from Rudd. If you haven't seen the pictures of the rolling scrum, this sound will give you a sense of how mad things are out there. Kevin Rudd is working hard to keep Tony Abbott, the most right wing leader the Liberal Party has ever put forward, from winning the election in September. Have a listen. I've just had a quick chat to Labor backbencher Steve Gibbons. Gibbons is bringing a motion to caucus tomorrow which has the intent of making caucus and not the Labor leader the decision-maker for who represents the party in frontbench spots. This used to be the case, 'caucus' (ie: the factions, used to decide who were the candidates for the front bench) - but Kevin Rudd changed the system to give the Labor leader the power to pick his or her own team. Caucus will have the chance tomorrow to decide whether to go back to the past practice, or stick with the Rudd system. Gibbons isn't sure whether his motion will have majority support or not, but he says there's lots of interest. He says the change: is not important, it's vital. He says removing that power from the caucus put too much power in the hands of one person. It was bad for the party, and that change has been at the root of a whole bunch of problems. Ironically, Kevin Rudd has said publicly he'll be supporting the Gibbons motion. Gibbons says he has no ulterior motive with this motion. Labor, he says, needs to rally around the current leader. I think we can still win the next election. Gibbons says Labor is currently giving the voters too many reasons not to vote for us. If you'd like to read the Gibbons motion, you can here. We should also note from today's opinion poll that while the Coalition would win easily any election contest held today, incumbent leaders aren't winning any popularity contests with Australian voters right now. Malcolm Turnbull remains more popular with voters than Tony Abbott in the Nielsen poll - 62 \u2009per cent of voters prefer him as Opposition leader compared with 32\u2009 per cent for Abbott. Labor's Darren Cheeseman in this morning's front page. Rudd supporter supports Rudd with tsunami analogy. Cheeseman: There's no doubt about it, we've got some stormy conditions to face - some stormy seas - and if we don't address these issues I think we are heading towards electoral annihilation and we'll be out of office for a very long time. We're all standing on the beach, the tsunami's coming and we've got to make the right decision, and if we make the right decision I think we can go on and win. Now, just a couple of comments about this whole dynamic. It's impossible to say right now how events will pan out in the coming days. But let's consider what has to happen if there's to be anything to this apart from hot air and generalised nonsense. We've had a public parade by caucus supporters of Kevin Rudd over the past few days. All midly interesting, but known. We know there are a number of people in the Labor caucus who would like Kevin Rudd to return to the top job. There's another example this morning. The Member for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman, has told his hometown paper, The Geelong Advertiser, that only Rudd can save Labor from wipeout in September. Cheeseman's comments are the front page splash. But what is material in this transaction is whether supporters of Julia Gillard switch camps. That's why the focus over the past week or so on the disposition of the Workplace Minister Bill Shorten - will Shorten switch his support to Kevin Rudd? But this is about more than Shorten in my view. It's about the group of ministers who have been loyal to Gillard throughout the cycles of this discussion Labor keeps having with itself. If that group cracks, then there might be something to see here, apart from hand-wringing and Kabuki play. Here's John Stirton, the Nielsen pollster, commenting on his poll in The Australian Financial Review this morning. (The magical scenario - and one that would see Kevin Rudd fall just short of holding government.) Stirton: This assumes a perfectly smooth transition from Ms Gillard to Mr Rudd, a supportive party united behind Mr Rudd and a honeymoon that continues until election day. It\u2019s a magical scenario. More realistically, Mr Rudd would probably retain more seats than Ms Gillard but he would be unlikely to retain government on these numbers. I flagged the new opinion polls in our wrap of the the political news this morning. Obviously the data is bad news for the Prime Minister in a few different ways. Labor's primary vote is down below 30 per cent again. All the focus on gender issues over the past week or so seems to have been a major turn off for male voters - among men in the Nielsen sample, Labor\u2019s primary vote fell 7 points from 31\u2009 per cent to 24\u2009 per cent. The new poll confirms a batch of data indicating that Kevin Rudd would fare much better than Julia Gillard at the election - he'd bring Labor back to level-pegging according to this morning's data. But Nielsen pollster John Stirton is using a phrase he likes using about the so-called Rudd effect - this is a magical scenario. Now what does he mean by that? He means this is a theoretical leadership change - one in which no blood is spilled, there is no ugly fighting or contention or cycles of revenge. It's a hypothetical number, not an actual measure of anything much, apart from a generalised confirmation that voters are more positively disposed to Rudd than Gillard. It's a complete circus out at the Canberra airport. I've just watched vision of the Foreign Minister Bob Carr fight his way through a wall of cameras, saying absolutely nothing. It's interesting that Pyne has already polished the attack lines in the event that Labor moves back to Kevin Rudd. It doesn't mean anything of substance, the Opposition is just working off the speculation that's about - but it does mean they've war gamed the responses should Labor switch horses. Pyne has been highlighting Kevin Rudd's more humane approach to asylum seekers as prime minister - Rudd after all was the leader who dismantled many of John Howard's harshest deterrence measures. It's where you'd expect them to go. Labor backbencher Laurie Ferguson flagged as much on his way into a dinner last night in parliament house for the local government association. Asked whether the party should switch leaders, Ferguson indicated if there was a switch to Rudd, then Coalition would just proceed to beat him up over boat people. In Ferguson's mind, it's a policy solution that's required, not window dressing at the top. Also busy this morning, Manager of Opposition Business and Shadow Education Minister Christopher Pyne. He (and his shadow - lovely pic here from Mike Bowers) spoke to reporters on the doors of parliament house a little while ago. Pyne was asked about the Gonski education package. The Opposition, as he put it this morning, neither voted for or against the package when it was in the House of Representatives. This is a very good way of putting it - the package passed the House on the voices, it did not come to a vote. The Coalition's disposition during the vote adds to a certain ambiguity about their intentions - will they dismantle Gonski or not? Pyne is suggesting that depends on how many states sign up. Is this a national agreement or not? Pyne has also been out with the attack lines about the Labor leadership. Changing leaders, Pyne has reasoned, won't change anything fundamental with the ALP. Labor will still be the same rat infested white anted haunted house. The House of Representatives begins sitting at 10am this morning. MPs are on their way in from the airport, including the Opposition leader Tony Abbott, who was stopped by reporters and asked to comment on the new batch of opinion polls out this morning. Here's a short audio grab from him if you care to listen. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of politics from Canberra. Mike Bowers was up with the birds this morning to check on activity around the parliament, and in our main image for this morning, captured the maintenance staff cleaning the forecourt. We wondered whether the pressure hose clean-up may extend to the inside of the building before the week is out - such has been the build up to this final sitting fortnight. Seems amazing doesn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve entered the last two sitting weeks of this 43rd parliament. Let\u2019s open this morning with a run through of some of the morning\u2019s main political stories. \u201cA source close to Kevin Rudd\u201d outlines his conditions (The Daily Telegraph) A source close to Mr Rudd revealed yesterday he would now not be part of a move to replace Ms Gillard unless key ministers, including some of Ms Gillard's supporters, declared their hand and \"owned the decision\". Several key ministers previously loyal to Ms Gillard have privately said they now supported the need for change but were reluctant to be involved in a spill. \"If they want this to happen, then they have to have the guts to put their name to it,\" one of Mr Rudd's confidantes said. \"And if they don't, they can go and fall off the cliff. No one is getting a free ride.\" Those that Mr Rudd would want to put their hand up include other ministers such as Penny Wong, Greg Combet and Jenny Macklin. Polls, Part One: Nielsen (The Australian Financial Review - paywalled) Julia Gillard\u2019s reigniting of the gender wars has imploded with male voters abandoning Labor, causing a crash in overall support for both the government and the Prime Minister\u2019s personal standing. The latest The Australian Financial Review/Nielsen poll also shows Labor would fare much better if it replaced Ms Gillard with Kevin Rudd but would be unlikely to win the election. Since the last poll a month ago, Labor\u2019s primary vote has slipped 3\u2009percentage points to 29\u2009per cent and the Coalition\u2019s has risen 3\u2009points to 47\u2009per cent, giving the Coalition a two-party preferred lead over Labor of 57\u2009per cent to 43 per cent. Polls, Part Two: Eden-Monaro focus group (The Conversation) As Labor caucus members return to Canberra uncertain who will be PM at the end of this final fortnight parliamentary sitting, voters in the bellwether seat of Eden-Monaro are saying to them: just sort your situation out \u2013 we are over it. In a discussion last week, most in the University of Canberra-The Conversation focus group thought that Kevin Rudd should lead Labor into the election, because he was more popular than Julia Gillard. In general however, people were exhausted by Labor\u2019s internal struggle. Across the political spectrum they were tired of the \u201ccircus\u201d, fueled by the media, and the way the leadership rumblings distract from what they see as more important things. Time\u2019s running out, Part One: The bucket list of the 43rd parliament (Guardian Australia) Cabinet will decide on Monday whether a last-ditch bid to extend federal powers to protect national parks from state government laws will be added to the legislation the government is trying to pass in the final two parliamentary sitting weeks. With just eight sitting days before parliament rises ahead of the election, the government has produced what amounts to this parliament's bucket list \u2013 the things it wants to legislate before time runs out \u2013 with changes to school funding and the requirements for employers wanting to use temporary work visas at the top. Time\u2019s running out, Part Two: Crossbenchers say the 43rd parliament has been misunderstood (Guardian Australia) As parliament begins its final two sitting weeks before the election and the electorate appears ready to pass a damning verdict on the government, the three independents and the Greens argue minority government has been badly misunderstood. They don't regret the decision they made after those 17 days in 2010 when they were weighing up whether Julia Gillard or Tony Abbott should be prime minister, and they firmly believe that history will judge the 43rd parliament more kindly than contemporary commentators do. Victorian Premier to Tony Abbott: reform the IR system (The Australian, paywalled) Tony Abbott has been warned that the industrial relations system needs an urgent overhaul to fireproof the economy by creating greater flexibility and driving productivity. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine has called for the federal Liberal leader to embrace workplace reform if elected to power. Dr Napthine said employers and employees should be able to negotiate more freely, although with the caveat that existing entitlements remain and that there be a \"no-disadvantage\" test. Don\u2019t burn the coal: Climate Commission (Fairfax media) Most of Australia's coal reserves will have to be left unburned if the world is to avoid catastrophic global warming, according to a major new report from the federal government's Climate Commission. The report puts the key science advisory body on a collision course with some of the nation's biggest export industries, and marks the first time a government agency has endorsed calls for fossil fuel industries to be phased out because of their contribution to climate change.
