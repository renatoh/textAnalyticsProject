Campbell is regarded as the outstanding member of the group of GSA graduates known as the New Glasgow Boys \u2013 after their predecessors, the Glasgow Boys of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He died in 2007 of a ruptured appendix, aged 54. Campbell and Forsyth were friends and fishing companions, and when the artist was asked to make a portrait of a famous Scot to add to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery he chose Forsyth, whose films include the 1981 low budget Gregory\u2019s Girl, Comfort and Joy and Local Hero, explaining: \u201cBill is the only famous person I know, and a pal.\u201d The art that Forsyth and Wylie have given, Fake Ophelia \u2013 part of Campbell\u2019s 1993 Pinocchio\u2019s Present exhibition in Edinburgh \u2013 is already hanging in the art school library. Alison Stevenson, head of learning resources at the GSA, said: \u201cSteven was an incredibly talented artist whose life was cut tragically short. We are delighted to be able to add Fake Ophelia to our rich collection of works by GSA graduates.\u201d Fake Ophelia was made at a particularly difficult time in Campbell\u2019s life, when his brother had died and he was being sued by his former New York dealers. He said working on the collage of string, cut paper and textiles until his fingers bled was therapeutic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
