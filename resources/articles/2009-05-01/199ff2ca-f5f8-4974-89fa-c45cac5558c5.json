Account holders may be approached over the phone or during bank visits as bank representatives make their pitch. It goes something like this: for a small monthly charge, you'll benefit from perks such as travel insurance, car breakdown cover and mobile phone insurance. All banks offer these accounts with bells and whistles. Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest charge the lowest fees at \u00a36.95. Lloyds TSB with its \u00a317 Platinum account and Abbey's Travel Reward account for \u00a315 come in at the top end. As of April this year, no less than 53 added-value current accounts were on the market, against 31 three years ago. \"It is no surprise to see the number of added-value current accounts increasing as there is great eagerness on the part of the banks to migrate customers from free in-credit current accounts,\" says David Black, principal consultant at Defaqto, a financial research company. \"For the banks the attraction of added-value current accounts is that they provide a guaranteed monthly income stream.\" If anything, the banks will be ever keener to promote their turbo-charged accounts if they lose a long-running battle over unauthorised overdraft charges, which earn the banks \u00a32.6bn a year. Litigation between the Office of Fair Trading and eight banks on the fairness of unauthorised overdraft charges started in July 2007 and the saga is expected to reach its denouement in 2010. If the OFT prevails, the banks face a double whammy. They will not only have to return several billion pounds to millions of customers, but also see a valuable source of income dry up. That prospect makes it imperative for banks to come up with alternatives for extracting money and backs speculation that a loss to the OFT would mean the era of free banking is coming to an end. But do such accounts make sense for customers? Observer reader Anne Oliver, who banks with First Direct, pays \u00a312 a month for a First Directory account. The benefits include worldwide travel insurance, car breakdown cover and ATM withdrawals abroad without charge. \"I got the account three years ago and for me it was useful because I used to travel a lot, so the travel insurance and free cash withdrawals made it worthwhile,\" she says. For most customers, the big draws are travel insurance and car breakdown cover. If they take advantage of the other perks \u2013 mobile phone insurance or discounts on home insurance \u2013 the accounts can make financial sense. \"In reality customers who get persuaded to switch from their basic current accounts probably don't end up taking advantage of what's on offer and yet have to spend anything between \u00a36 and \u00a325 a month,\" says Andrew Hagger of Moneynet. \"It is the travel insurance and car breakdown cover that offers you the main value. If you don't make use of both of these, then you seriously have to question if you're paying out \u00a3120 to \u00a3200 a year for next to nothing.\" Interest and fee-free overdrafts are another feature that make added-value accounts superficially attractive. The Co-op off ers a \u00a3200 interest overdraft with its Privilege account, with a monthly fee of \u00a38.50, or \u00a3102 a year. But the Co-op, Smile, Barclays and Halifax all offer a \u00a3300 overdraft for 12-months at a standard current account average rate of 14.4%, which, if used, works out as costing \u00a343.20 a year. Personal circumstances change, so value accounts need to be reassessed. Oliver does not travel as much as she used to, so the travel insurance and free ATM withdrawals in her First Directory account no longer seem that alluring. \"The experts are probably right about people like me because I've never bothered to see what all the leisure discounts are and have not yet used roadside assistance,\" she says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
