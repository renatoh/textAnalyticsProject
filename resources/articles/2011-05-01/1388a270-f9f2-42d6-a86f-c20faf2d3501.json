When she was a student at the University of Minnesota she became friends with a wannabe folk singer from Hibbing, Minnesota, who had just begun to call himself Bob Dylan. He spent a lot of time at our house before he left for New York. My mother would feed him and wash his clothes and he would listen to my father's collection of records by Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie. My mother invited this unknown young man to come to her classroom of nine-year-olds to perform more than once. Martha Jean Baker London \u2022 John Harris talks of his \"obsession\" with Dylan and cites seeing him 15 times in concert since the mid-1980s. That's no obsession \u2013 more a passing interest.
