Two more goals from Didier Drogba, taking his total for another season of pillage and plunder to 25, proved decisive, but relegation-threatened Wolves created more chances and would have had a point but for a couple of top-notch saves by Peter Cech. John Terry was back from \"compassionate leave\" and it seems Ashley Cole may be needing some of the same. If all the tabloid titillation is to be believed, this was a case of the Wolves versus the rutting stags. Blue is the colour in more ways than one these days, and Terry and the injured Cole were both abused throughout with toilet \"humour\" that was fourth form at best. It is not only certain players who need to grow up. Personal problems aside, this was a scoreline that might easily have been predicted. Promoted under Dave Jones seven years ago, Wolves enjoyed just one season in elite company before sinking back whence they came, and history could well be repeating itself for Mick McCarthy and his goal-shy strugglers. Despite their moniker, the present Molineux pack are a toothless bunch, having scored just 10 goals in their 14 home games \u2013 seven of which have been lost. They drew encouragement from a 1-0 victory over Tottenham last time out, but that was their first win in seven league matches. Their main difficulty is not hard to identify: they have conceded twice as many goals as they have scored. Kevin Doyle, the \u00a36.5m record summer signing from Reading, is currently their most prolific finisher with a modest six goals in 23 league appearances. Much was expected of Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, who scorched through the Championship with 25 goals last season, but the England Under-21 striker has been a significant disappointment, scoring only once in 17 appearances at the higher level. Drogba, with 19 goals in 22 league games, has scored only two fewer than the Wolves squad in total. Chelsea may be top of the table by a healthy margin after Manchester United's defeat by Everton, but it has not been all hunky-dory at the Bridge of late \u2013 on or off the field. Continued allegations of sexual impropriety by prominent players brought a warning from the owner, Roman Abramovich, and solicitors' letters to certain newspapers on Friday, while on the pitch they had dropped points in five of their previous six away matches. In all, they have lost four away games, one of which was to Wigan \u2013 a result that should have given Wolves grounds for optimism. Ditto the absence of Frank Lampard, with a virus. Lampard was replaced by Joe Cole, making only his 10th start of the season in the league, and whose consequent rustiness is seriously undermining his prospects of selection for the World Cup. Terry, too, must be a concern for Fabio Capello in this form. Stripped of the England captaincy for reasons that need no repetition here, he is playing as if distracted by the opprobrium that has been heaped upon him, and one attempted clearance, when he missed the ball entirely, would have ended in acute embarrassment but for Cech's face-saving intervention. Wolves began brightly and \"had the game by the scruff of the neck\", as Mick McCarthy put it, for nearly the whole of a first half in which Doyle tested Cech from the edge of the D, and again from much closer in. The turning point came in the 40th minute, when the first demonstration of the class Chelsea had hidden under the Molineux bushel saw Yuri Zhirkov and Michael Ballack work a neat one-two to set up Drogba for his first, sliding in at the far post. Wolves recovered so well that they might have been in front within 25 minutes. Instead, Cech distinguished himself with a reaction save to keep out Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura's close-range volley, then leapt to the rescue again when Terry's \"air shot\" let in Kevin Foley. McCarthy was confident of a comeback draw at this stage, but midway through the second half Christophe Berra failed to cut out a long clearance from Cech and Drogba was allowed to run on and take the ball wide of Marcus Hahnemann before scoring left-footed, from 12 yards. McCarthy was \"really annoyed\" by Berra's defensive lapse. \"A poor piece of defending let them in and demoralised all of us so much that we might as well have come off there and then.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Arthur Williams, Observer reader Chelsea have quality all the way through and you can't say playing Doyle up front with the two dropping back behind him was the wrong tactics. Drogba was up against Craddock, who wasn't overawed by him and played really well. The two goals were both from breakaways and unfortunately when you're pressuring Chelsea you always leave yourself open to conceding like that. It was a pretty good performance all-round. Guedioura's workrate was phenomenal. The way Wolves have set up and played, there was no disgrace in losing today. Against a weaker side if we can play like that there should be no problems staying up. The fan's player ratings Hahnemann 6; Zubar 7, Craddock 8, Berra 7, Ward 6; Foley 5 (Halford 77 5), Jones 8 (Ebanks-Blake 77 6), Henry 7, Guedioura 9, Jarvis 8 (Mujangi 77 5); Doyle 7 Trizia Fiorellino, Chelsea Supporters Group We were very lucky to win the game. Cech made two world\u2011class saves and Terry cleared off the line as well. Chelsea were slow out of the traps and allowed the pressure. The first goal was excellent but it was the first time we'd strung together any passes. The Manchester United result put more pressure on us and our away form has been woeful. I'm still dubious as to whether this formation suits the team \u2013 we struggle as we look for the wide men and they aren't there. Bruma is only 17 but looked the part and played very well. Whoever wins this league owes the others a crate of champagne \u2013 it's going to be a case of the fewest mistakes wins.
