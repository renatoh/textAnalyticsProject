Californication. Photograph: Five There's something quite lame about the title of Californication (Five). I know it's the name of a Chili Peppers album, but that's no excuse. Still, as I lay in bed this morning, waiting for my alarm clock's snooze period to end, it did get me wondering what a drama with a lot of nooky in it - which is essentially what this is - might have been called had it been set elsewhere in the United States. Texass, Massachusex, Wiscon(original)sin, New Sexico ... Still no alarm (my clock is quite generous), so it didn't end there, I'm afraid, though it certainly did get more desperate. Tennessee-thru, New Jersey Nothing Underneath, Hawaiidon'twedoitintheroad, Alawhambamathankyoumama ... Ding-a-ling-ding-ding. Phew. Saved. There is an awful lot of nooky in Californication. Right at the start, David Duchovny walks into a church to seek advice from God, but gets waylaid by a very attractive nun who immediately takes him to Kensucky (stop it!). This turns out to be a dream, but real life isn't so different. Duchovny plays Hank Moody, a troubled novelist with writer's block. That doesn't stop him getting lucky with the ladies, though - a whole string of them fall naked at his feet, wherever he goes. Well, he was Mulder in The X-Files, after all. The only woman who keeps Delawearing her clothes is the one whose knickers he'd most like to see on the bedroom Floorida (enough!): his ex, Karen, played by our own Natascha McElhone. Ah, that's where the nun-dream came from - the unattainable attained. Hank is an attractive character - hopeless, lovable, louche, highly bedable, obviously. It's clear that Karen still has a soft spot for him, but he's trouble, too, and she knows it. She can't cut Hank out of her life completely, though, because they have a daughter together: Becca, whose own sexual alarm clock is just starting to go off . Hank is understandably keen that she keeps hitting the snooze button - she is only 12, after all. My guess is that at some point in an episode not very far in the future, Hank and Karen are going to get rejiggy with each other, and that will throw up all sorts of problems, not least because Karen is now engaged to Bill. Oh, and Bill's sultry daughter Mia is one of Hank's numerous girlfriends. Got it? Keep up, it's complicated I know, but this is California and they do things differently over there. In spite of its silly name, Californication is fun, in a not-too-taxing, body-beautiful, image-conscious kind of way. A bit Entourage, though not as funny; very West Coast; one for the boys, I'd say. But I am one of them, so I'm sticking with it, for a while at least. Five's other new US import, which follows straight after Californication, is quite different. 30 Rock is set and filmed in New York, and it feels East Coast - the bodies are less perfect, the sex is also less perfect and less frequent, but the jokes are sharper and wittier. Coastist stereotypes I'm sure, but maybe true. 30 Rock is a sitcom, the sit being the set of a sketch show. So it's TV within TV, televisual onanism, which is all the rage right now. It's written by and stars former Saturday Night Live performer and writer Tina Fey. In 30 Rock she plays the writer of a sketch show called The Girlie Show ... Hell, this is complicated. So you've got a real sketch-show writer and performer playing the writer of a fictional sketch show (which happens to share its title with a real former talkshow) in a real sitcom. Television's current obsession with itself certainly makes things difficult, more complicated even than what they get up to in California. Actually, it's much clearer when you watch it. As you should. Because it's dead funny, much sharper than Jennifer Saunders's Vivienne Vyle, our current homegrown attempt at the genre. And cleverer than that other inexplicably successful but clunky workplace-based sitcom, Ugly Betty. Tina Fey is great as Liz Lemon , but she's probably just playing herself. So the star of the show must be Alec Baldwin, who plays Liz's boss, Jack, a larger-than-life corporate monster who understands money and ratings but not how to make television. It doesn't stop him having a go, though - just as Roman Abramovich did at Chelsea before Mourinho stormed off. Liz doesn't like it any more than Jose did, and tries to walk out too, but, unlike Mourinho, is persuaded to stay. The show goes on. And that's a good thing, because 30 Rock could be a little gem - a diamond, not a lettuce. I think ladies may even like it, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
