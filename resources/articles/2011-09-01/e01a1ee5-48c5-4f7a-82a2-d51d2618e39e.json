Samir Nasri, 2011", "bodyText": "Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) Depending on the severity of the hacking offence, caution or send off the defender. It is not a straight red card for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity though, because the ball was not in play \u2013 it had not left the penalty area. So, having dealt with the defender, restart with a retaken goal-kick. Thanks to Jim Potter. 2) One of the players has committed a deliberate offence, one has not. So show the defender a red card for deliberately spitting at an opponent. The striker's act might not have been pleasant, but it was not deliberate, so there is no action to take against him. Restart play with a penalty to the attacking team. Peter Madson wins the shirt. 3) You are still within your rights to change your decision because play has not restarted. So disallow the goal, and, if the crossbar cannot be repaired or replaced, abandon the game \u2013 unless there is an alternative pitch available. Report what happened to the relevant authorities \u2013 this could have been a very serious incident.
