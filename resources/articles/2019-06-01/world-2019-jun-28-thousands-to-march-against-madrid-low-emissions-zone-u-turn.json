Thousands of people are to march through the city centre on Saturday night to protest against the overturning of the zone, which was brought in last November by the capital\u2019s then mayor, the leftwing Manuela Carmena. Madrid\u2019s new city council \u2013 which is led by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party and backed by the far-right Vox \u2013 announced moves to begin rolling back the Madrid Central zone days after taking office earlier this month. From 1 July, the council will no longer fine people for taking more polluting vehicles into the centre, in effect shutting down the low-emissions zone. However, it said the suspension was only temporary and could be reversed. Teresa Ribera, Spain\u2019s acting minister for the ecological transition, said the new council was making a grave environmental, political and financial error. \u201cSome of the candidates for the mayoralty made a bit of a mistake by thinking that this was an ideological measure rather than one was introduced to be in step with people\u2019s needs and values, and which is in line with European obligations on public health and air quality,\u201d she told the Guardian. During the campaign before May\u2019s local and regional elections, the PP\u2019s candidate for the presidency of the Madrid regional government attacked the scheme, saying congestion was \u201cpart of the life in Madrid\u201d, and that the city\u2019s nightlife \u201cgoes hand in hand with traffic jams\u201d. Ribera pointed out that rolling back the low-emissions zone would result in the council opening itself up to fines from the EU for failing to comply with air quality legislation. \u201cAre they going to divert public money from the Madrid city budget to pay fines for something they\u2019ve done on an ideological whim \u2013 and which goes against people\u2019s health? Something based on the fundamental right to be in a traffic jam at 3am? That\u2019s just silly. I don\u2019t think that anyone in a position of institutional power would be that irresponsible.\u201d The acting minister said she doubted that Madrid Central would be abandoned, not least because public opinion in the capital was behind the scheme. \u201cThe physical, legal, health and scientific arguments are so overwhelming that there\u2019s no way of reversing Manuela Carmena\u2019s initiative and whoever\u2019s running things needs to build on that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the new city council will come to realise that this is not a measure that can be easily reversed. I also think it\u2019ll be widely rejected socially.\u201d According to the environmental group Ecologists in Action, Madrid Central has already brought about record reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels in the city centre, with pollution from the gas 48% lower in April 2019 than during the same month last year. Nitrogen dioxide levels across the city, meanwhile, are down by 16%. The group\u2019s coordinator, Paco Segura, said that scrapping the scheme in a region where contaminated air causes aabout 3,000 premature deaths a year was \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d. In the past month, more than 224,000 people have signed a petition calling for Madrid Central to be preserved. Earlier this week, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s department of public health and environment highlighted the benefits of schemes such as Madrid Central. Dr Mar\u00eda Neira said they brought economic benefits, reduced accidents and helped tackle obesity by encouraging people to be less sedentary. \u201cPolicies for sustainable cities only bring benefits that work in favour of people and not cars,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that protects health shouldn\u2019t be touched; it\u2019s something that should always be improved.\u201d Madrid\u2019s new mayor, the PP\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, has described Madrid Central as a failure and said his team was working to find alternative ways to ensure \u201csustainable transport\u201d, such as lanes for buses and high-occupancy vehicles. His deputy, Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds of the Citizens party, has been more circumspect, saying the decision to stop fining people from 1 July \u201cisn\u2019t a reversal of Madrid Central\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to simply change everything back to how it was,\u201d she told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo earlier this month. \u201cNow it\u2019s up and running, we know which bits of it work and which don\u2019t, so we can listen to people and adapt it as needs be. But I don\u2019t think a total reversal is the option.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
