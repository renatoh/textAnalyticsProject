And then, as the flywheel found speed, a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling would begin to glow and finally burn brightly. It was called a Lister and it ruled my early life, just as similar generators have ruled the lives of the residents of the Nedd valley in Wales until last week, when the National Grid finally enclosed them. I grew up in Glencassely, at the heart of Sutherland, Britain's least populated county. Ours was one of the last glens in Scotland to be connected to the mains, just as the Nedd valley was the last in England and Wales. Until the pylons came, the beast in the shed would dictate the rhythms of our existence. The expense meant that the machine would be turned off when it wasn't needed, giving my father an extraordinary power over our lives. In Sutherland, in winter, the sun sets at 3.30pm. It was two miles to the nearest house. The darkness was absolute once the generator was off. My father had made a good living weaving canvas in the 1960s, when he gave it up to move north and become a hill farmer. He installed a switch beside his bed, and when he decided it was time for sleep he would flick it off. While I, having been raised there, was a solitary, feral creature, my siblings were all older, and had friends from before. They would turn up, stay up, laugh and listen to records. When the switch was flicked, Paul Weller's voice would elongate to silence as the Jam lost speed. Shouts of indignation would fill the house, and in the darkness I could sense my father's grin. Curiously, my parent's dream had included a self-contained Nordic sauna, which took up much of the bathroom. I don't remember them ever using it, and I dismissed it as a hide-out in favour of the bug-rich cathedrals I created under the rhododendrons, or the eyries in the rocks above the house. Who wants a Swedish hide-out? In winter, though, when there was no other way of getting warm, I would demand a shot in it, and, embarrassed by its extravagance, my parents would turn everything else off so the generator could take the strain. It would have to be accompanied by a freezing bath. The moment of someone else getting into a bath would be my father's favourite time for turning off the electricity for the night. There in the absolute dark, you could do nothing but listen for approaching killers. The pylons arrived in the mid-1980s and the generator turned from master to slave, a luxury to be used smugly during power cuts. The sauna became too expensive. Needing to go to the bathroom in the early hours lost its terrors. The wilderness itself was pushed back, to reside weakly in the lead pipes and the failure of a television signal to penetrate the deep glen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
