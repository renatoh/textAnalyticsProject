Professor David Woods, chief adviser for London schools, accused parents who attend \"dinner parties in Islington\" of writing off excellent comprehensives on their doorsteps, and challenged them to go and spend a day in a local school In an interview with the Guardian, he condemned parents who automatically send their children from a state primary to a grammar or private secondary school, rather than to a comprehensive. \"Some parents, while perfectly prepared to buy into state primary education, have an innate prejudice against their local state secondary school,\" said Woods, who has worked with education ministers since 1998 to shape government policy on underperforming comprehensives. \"Despite what you hear from the chattering classes \u2013 by which I mean the dinner parties of Islington \u2013 London's state secondary schools are doing very well. Almost a quarter have been judged outstanding. There are parents who, given a very good state school on their doorstep, would not send their children there because they have an innate prejudice against it. Why don't they go in and spend a day there? Parents have a perfect right to make their own decisions, but I think sometimes it is done on the basis of prejudice.\" There has been a dramatic improvement in the proportion of comprehensive pupils obtaining five good GCSE grades and the number of comprehensives labelled as \"failing\" dropped from about half in 1997 to one in 10 now. However, the proportion of 15-year-olds in England who are educated in private schools grew from 6.5% to 7.3% between 2002 and 2007, statistics from the Annual Schools Census, the National Pupil Database and the Independent Schools Council say \u2013 although more recently some private schools have been hit by the recession. In London, the proportion of parents choosing private schools is higher than in the rest of the country, with 9% of 15-year-olds attending private schools. Across England, the number of 10-year-olds who attend state primary schools and transfer to a private secondary school is 2.3%, while in London it is 3.7%. Woods, who is in charge of the government's National Challenge, a \u00a3400m-plus drive to eradicate failing secondary schools across England, said parents' prejudices are based on assumptions about the kind of young people who attend comprehensives and an expectation that standards there are low. He said: \"We have significantly raised standards in London's comprehensives over the last decade, but obviously the independent sector is still quite strong. \" Michael Pyke, of the Campaign for State Education said: \"Popular prejudice against comprehensives is a result of the hierarchical nature of our education system. We live in a society where sending your children to a private school confers status on parents.\" But Woods's comments have angered some parents, teachers and academics who claim that it is partly the government's fault that some parents are choosing selective and private schools over comprehensives. David James, professor of education at the University of the West of England, said ministers had promoted the idea of a market, where parents could choose between an academy, a comprehensive, a grammar or a private, faith or foundation school. Fiona Millar, a state school campaigner whose three children went to comprehensives near to where she lives in Camden, north London, said some parents now experienced \"epic levels of anxiety about school choice\". \"The children of aspirant, supportive and graduate parents can easily flourish in their local state school if it is good enough. But it can be hard to persuade parents of that.\" Jason Moro, deputy head of North London Collegiate girls' school, said the \"not insignificant\" number of \"liberal, left-wing\" parents sending their daughters to his school, where fees are \u00a33,975 a term, showed no sign of decreasing. \"Woods is wrong to talk about an innate prejudice among these parents,\" he said. \"Parents are more sophisticated than that. They are savvy and informed consumers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
