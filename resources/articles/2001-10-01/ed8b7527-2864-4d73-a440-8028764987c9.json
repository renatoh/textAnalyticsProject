The Observer has been told by government sources involved in the sale that the worsening economic outlook, exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in the US last month, has caused the consortia trying to buy the Dome to revise down their purchase price. Potential Dome-buyers are concerned that the income derived from housing projects in the shadow of the giant tent will fail to make as much money as they had thought. A sale is not expected to be completed this year and could be as late as next spring, once the direction of the economy can be safely gauged. This will add millions of pounds to the \u00a3750,000 per month cost to taxpayers of keeping the Greenwich site secure. The first contender for the Dome is a consortium comprising the Duke of Westminster, property developer Stanhope, Lend Lease, the giant Australian retail developer, and Quintain, the property company that owns 14 acres next to the Dome site. Its main rival is the Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, which hopes to put a research centre on the site. It is understood that the Government is talking to one other party. The public, through Lottery money or taxes, has already sunk close to \u00a31 billion into the Dome. Its sale could fetch \u00a3150m, plus another \u00a3100m depending on how much land is in the sale. Regeneration experts say the Government could double that figure if it dismantled the tent. But English Partnerships, the government quango that owns the site, has been ordered by the Prime Minister not to demolish the tent. Already two preferred bidders have pulled out of the race to buy what is a prime piece of real estate with lucrative river frontage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
