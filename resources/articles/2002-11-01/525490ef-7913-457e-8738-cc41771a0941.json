The Italian's patience has snapped after repeated suggestions from Gregory that the striker's achilles injury is not serious enough to have kept him out of action for all but the first three games of the season. Ravanelli - who says he has not received his \u00a340,000-a-week salary for three months, according to his agent Gianni Paladini - spent yesterday discussing the matter with his solicitor. \"I will be speaking to him again in the next 24 hours and then we will make a statement about the situation,\" the striker said. Paladini said that Ravanelli was increasingly angry at Gregory using his absence with injury as an excuse for Derby's poor start to the season. Craig Burley has been annoyed in like manner; the Scot, out for 11 months with a similar injury to Ravanelli's, is also understood to have consulted lawyers. Derby's chairman Lionel Pickering, meanwhile, says he is prepared to write off the \u00a324m he has spent at the club and walk away but cannot do so until somebody takes over the \u00a39m personal guarantees he has given to two banks to keep the club afloat. Derby are \u00a319.1m in debt against an agreed overdraft limit of \u00a312m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
