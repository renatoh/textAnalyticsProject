The first was a traverse of the great west face of the Gros Lohner in the Bernese Oberland in 2000 (a route eventually completed at the third attempt). The other was, believe it or not, a crossing of the marshy moorsides north-east of Revidge not far above Warslow village. Paths lead northwards from this village, crossing attractive hill pastures, but beyond Hayes Farm the ground deteriorates to ill-drained, rush-covered slopes. John Gould's family farmed at Hayes through the 20th century and he recently told me how he spent decades attempting to drain this part of the holding, to make it more productive. Now the tenant is paid subsidy to leave it in a natural state to encourage ground nesting birds like snipe and curlew. Otherwise it is quite unproductive and can hardly be classed as being of \"leisure\" value. Anyway, the other day I decided to have a second attempt to cross this ground en route from Warslow to Reaps Moor. I was determined to succeed \u2013 last year I had to turn down the slope on reaching impossible bogs. All went well for a time, then I came again to waist-high rushes punctuated with deep, peaty pools that threatened to suck me out of sight. Progress became impossibly slow \u2013 it would take hours to get across this murky slough that is a virtual waste of otherwise lovely upland space \u2013 so I turned slantwise up the slope towards the track to Cuckoostone Farm. It was a further obstacle course of despondency, knee-deep in places, though I did manage some respite on the bocage-like mounds supporting toppled drystone walls until I stepped out on to the track down to Cuckoostone Farm. The firm terrain was welcome. So it was rounds one and two to the morass \u2013 who knows how round three will eventually work out!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
