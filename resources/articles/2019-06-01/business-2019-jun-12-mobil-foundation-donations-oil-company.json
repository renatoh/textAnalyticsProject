Dr David Page visited Nigeria after the spill and offered his views of its impact to the New York Times, which were published in special report dated 20 September that year. Page\u2019s arrival on the scene was anticipated years earlier in Mobil\u2019s plans, internal Mobil Foundation documents newly obtained by the Guardian reveal. \u201cBetween Mother Nature and Mobil\u2019s highly effective and targeted response, the shoreline was spared what could have been a very serious environmental event,\u201d Page, described as a Bowdoin College professor and \u201can American oil spill expert\u201d, told the New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m not an attorney,\u2019\u2019 Page continued, \u201cbut it\u2019s fair to say that because so little oil got ashore, I\u2019d be very surprised if fishermen\u2019s livelihoods were cut off.\u2019\u2019 Others found the spill far more significant, however. It proved to be one of the largest in Nigerian history \u2013 by the gallon, one-sixth the size of the Exxon Valdez catastrophe. Roughly 1 million people lived in areas Human Rights Watch later listed as \u201cthe worst hit\u201d by the spill. Crude reached as far as Lagos harbor, over 500 miles away. Mobil collected oil-clogged nets from fishermen and burned them, offering in exchange sums locals said were a fraction of replacement costs. Legal battles, protests and unrest continued for two decades. Five years before the spill, the Mobil Foundation, run by top Mobil executives, had named Page in its decision to continue funding Bowdoin College\u2019s Marine Research Laboratory \u2013 writing that a proposed $10,000 grant for the lab could help \u201cassure rapid response to any possible Mobil spill events\u201d. \u201cDrs [Edward] Gilfillan and Page \u2026 are our most valuable marine pollution contacts outside the industry,\u201d Mobil Foundation wrote in the documents, adding that the lab had already received $132,000 from Mobil from 1986 to 1993, and that the lab maintained \u201ca healthy attitude toward the oil industry\u2019s requirements for transportation and storage of petroleum on the world\u2019s waters\u201d. The foundation had listed Nigeria as one of four areas worldwide where Page\u2019s work on mangrove swamps could prove useful, especially when it came to \u201clitigation concerning environmental damage\u201d. In an email response to the Guardian\u2019s questions about Mobil Foundation funding for Bowdoin, Page said: \u201cAt no time was there an expectation of a quid pro quo \u2013 in any form. It was a philanthropic activity in an area of interest to Mobil.\u201d He said the grants went towards funding summer research student placements. \u201cIn the case of the 1998 IDOHO spill, Mobil asked us to work with a group of Nigerian academic and non-academic professionals to share our experience and help them conduct a post-spill impact study that would meet international standards,\u201d he wrote. Shaping regulations Nigeria was not the only place Mobil reaped benefits its tax-exempt foundation sought to claim from its charitable giving, according to previously undisclosed internal documents from the early 1990s. The Mobil Foundation also sought to use its tax-exempt grants to shape American laws and regulations on issues ranging from the climate crisis to toxic chemicals \u2013 with the explicit goal of benefiting Mobil, the documents show. Recipients of Mobil Foundation grants included Ivy League universities, branches of the National Academies and well-known civic organizations and environmental researchers. Benefits for Mobil included \u2013 in the foundation\u2019s words \u2013 funding \u201ca counterpoint to so-called \u2018public interest\u2019 groups\u201d, helping Mobil obtain \u201cearly access\u201d to scientific research, and offering the oil giant\u2019s executives a forum to \u201cchallenge EPA behind-the-scenes\u201d. The documents, which include research, engineering and environmental affairs grant recommendations for 1994, cover over 120 proposals worth about $1.2m \u2013 roughly 10% of the foundation\u2019s total budget that year \u2013 and list more than 700 grants from prior years. Dozens of the single-page grant recommendations include full paragraphs on the \u201cbenefits to Mobil\u201d that Mobil executives predicted the company could cull from the foundation\u2019s gifts. Each recommendation offers an unprecedented window into Mobil\u2019s internal reasoning. One page lists $100,000 in grants from 1990-1993 for the HarvardSchool of Public Health\u2019s Center for Risk Analysis. The center\u2019s director, John Graham, \u201chas been effective in \u2026 pointing out the safety risks associated with excessively stringent fuel economy standards\u201d, Mobil Foundation wrote as it proposed more funding. Graham had previously published a 1992 report titled The Safety Risks of Proposed Fuel Economy Legislation which made no mention of Mobil\u2019s funding for the Harvard-based center. Another page reveals the former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assistant administrator John Moore sought out grants from Mobil and at least seven other large corporations for the Institute for Evaluating Health Risks, where Moore served as president and chief executive officer. Mobil gave $40,000 to help the newly formed institute \u201cstaff up and demonstrate its effectiveness\u201d. Mobil Foundation recommended more for 1994, writing that Moore\u2019s work offered a way \u201cultimately to influence the development of more cost-effective [environmental, health and safety] regulations\u201d. A third page reveals Mobil Foundation\u2019s efforts to expand its audience inside environmental circles via a grant for the Environmental Law Institute, a half-century-old organization offering environmental law research and education to lawyers and judges. \u201cInstitute publications are widely read in the environmental community and are helpful in communicating industry\u2019s concerns to such organizations,\u201d the entry says. \u201cMobil Foundation grants will enhance environmental organizations\u2019 views of Mobil, enable us to reach through ELI activities many groups that we do not communicate with, and enable Mobil to participate in their dialogue groups.\u201d \u2018A wake-up call\u2019 The documents also show Mobil Foundation closely examining the work of individual researchers at dozens of colleges and universities as they made their funding decisions, listing ways that foundation grants would help shape research interests to benefit Mobil, help the company recruit future employees, or help combat environmental and safety regulations that Mobil considered costly. \u201cIt should be a wake-up call for university leaders, because what it says is that fossil fuel funding is not free,\u201d said Geoffrey Supran, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard and MIT. \u201cWhen you take it, you pay with your university\u2019s social license,\u201d Supran said. \u201cYou pay by helping facilitate these companies\u2019 political and public relations tactics.\u201d In some cases, the foundation described how volunteer-staffed not-for-profits had saved Mobil money by doing work that would have otherwise been performed by Mobil\u2019s paid staff, like cleaning birds coated in oil following a Mobil spill. In 1987, the International Bird Rescue Research Center\u2019s \u201crapid response and assistance to Mobil\u2019s West Coast pipeline at a spill in Lebec, CA not only defused a potential public relations problem\u201d, Mobil Foundation said, \u201cbut saved substantial costs by not requiring our department to fly cross country to respond\u201d. If Mobil classified donations as charitable contributions but it actually received valuable services as a result of its \u201cgifts\u201d, that could raise concerns about illegal self-dealing, tax experts told the Guardian. The \u201cbenefits to Mobil\u201d paragraphs struck Marcus Owens, a Loeb &amp; Loeb attorney who served for 10 years as the director of the exempt organizations division of the Internal Revenue Service, as out of the ordinary. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at all kinds of grant files in my career, both wearing an IRS hat and in my private practice,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen that. The reason is because, even if it isn\u2019t an act of self-dealing, it sure smells like it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a red flag,\u201d he added, \u201ca blinking red siren light.\u201d The IRS had little institutional capacity to investigate self-dealing by private foundations, Owens said, citing a lack of IRS enforcement staff focused on not-for-profits. The IRS today, he added, has less ability to investigate than it did in the 1990s, when there were at times special audit programs looking at foundations. An IRS representative declined to comment on the bureau\u2019s investigation capacity. Tax benefits Mobil might have been able to claim similar tax benefits by signing contracts for services with some of the not-for-profits they funded and listing the expense as a business deduction, tax experts told the Guardian \u2013 but not-for-profits on the other side of those deals might have faced their own ethical, tax or legal questions if they took payment for the services Mobil sought. In addition, by offering funding through the Mobil Foundation, Mobil created the impression that the grants were made at arm\u2019s length and explicitly not for the company\u2019s private benefit. Publicly available disclosures shed little light on Mobil\u2019s motives for funding \u2013 and outwardly similar grants could appear very different from inside the foundation. The Mobil Foundation\u2019s tax filings for 1994 \u2013 the only information Mobil would generally have been required to make public \u2013 list a $25,000 \u201ccivic\u201d grant for the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The newly uncovered documents reveal the foundation had separately considered two distinct donations to the academy. One $10,000 grant was for \u201cenvironmental research and science education programs\u201d, listing \u201cspecial employee nights at the museum\u201d among the \u201cBenefits to Mobil Foundation, Inc\u201d. A second $15,000 grant was directed at the Academy\u2019s Environmental Associates Program, founded by a pioneering scientist, Dr Ruth Patrick, who got her start at the academy in 1933, taught generations of scientists during three decades at the University of Pennsylvania, and helped to draft the Clean Water Act. \u201cBased on the contacts of the Academy,\u201d the Mobil Foundation wrote as it recommended that larger grant, \u201cthe Environmental Associates Program has the potential to challenge the EPA behind-the-scenes on the effectiveness of a regulation for the environment and whether sound science supports the proposed law.\u201d Another $15,000 grant for the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) is listed under \u201cHealth Agencies\u201d in the Mobil Foundation\u2019s 1994 tax filing. Mobil Foundation\u2019s internal documents reveal concern over regulation motivated its grant-makers. \u201cACSH promotes rational understanding of the relative minor risks from most industrial chemicals compared with those accepted as normal from natural causes,\u201d the Mobil Foundation wrote as it recommended a $15,000 grant for 1994, adding that the proposed grant had the support of Mobil\u2019s medical and public relations departments. \u201cOne of the major benefits is due to the Executive Director, Dr Elizabeth Whelan, an articulate spokesperson who often appears as a counterpoint to so-called \u2018public interest\u2019 groups.\u201d The statute of limitations for any tax code violations from the 1980s and 90s is probably long expired, tax experts said. The IRS approved Mobil Foundation\u2019s merger into the ExxonMobil Foundation in 2001, after Mobil Corp joined with Exxon to form the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company. ExxonMobil is currently facing investigations or lawsuits by multiple state attorneys general, related to claims the oil giant failed to communicate known climate change-related risks to investors and the public. Mobil and climate change While much attention has focused on what Exxon knew about climate change before the two companies merged, the records reveal Mobil\u2019s growing alarm about climate change in the early 1990s. From 1991 to 1993, Mobil gave $75,000 to Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, famed for its climate change research, and recommended an additional $25,000 for 1994 so employees could \u201cdevelop personal relationships with some of the key experts\u201d on what Mobil predicted would be \u201cthe key international environmental issue of the 1990s\u201d. \u201cWhile there currently are no regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases, such regulations are a real possibility within the next five years,\u201d the grant recommendation adds. \u201cTechnical information and understanding will be key to Mobil\u2019s ability to participate in the debate on these regulations.\u201d A Mobil vice-president named John J Wise signed the approvals for that recommendation, along with about $1.2m in other grants for the year. Within roughly five years, Wise counted himself both a member of the board of trustees at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (recipient of listed donations totalling over $200,000 from Mobil) and a part of UN efforts to study climate change. Wise ultimately co-authored two UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, serving as a lead author on one. One report chapter Wise co-authored prominently recommended, among other things, burning natural gas (an ExxonMobil product) instead of coal as a way to combat climate change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
