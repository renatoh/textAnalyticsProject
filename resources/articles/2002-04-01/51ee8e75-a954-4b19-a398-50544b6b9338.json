Moore led England for the first time, against Czechoslovakia in Bratislava in May 1963, at 22 years 47 days. Owen will be 77 days older when he leads out Eriksson's team on his home ground at Anfield this evening. Owen gets this unexpected, some might say unfathomable, chance to show his qualities of leadership because David Beckham is out of England's World Cup preparations with a broken foot. And though Eriksson stressed yesterday that Owen was not yet being lined up as an alternative captain for Japan, the fact that he has been given the armband at all will add his name to the list of candidates. \"In the present squad we have David Seaman, Gareth Southgate and Gary Neville who might also have been captain,\" said Eriksson. \"Michael Owen could be one for the future. \"But this decision is only for this match. If David Beckham is not back for the World Cup we'll have to look at the situation then. For the moment I prefer not to talk in terms of Beckham not being fit. I'm assuming he will be able to play in our opening game against Sweden.\" Nevertheless the possibility of Owen wearing the armband when it really matters should not be ruled out, especially if his captaincy impresses Eriksson tonight. Clearly the England coach has spotted something in the young striker's make-up which puts him up for promotion. \"He's a clean-cut, talented young player who, barring injury, will be in the England team for many, many years,\" Eriksson enthused. \"Already he's a great footballer. I don't yet know whether he can be a great leader. That's up to him.\" Despite his youth Owen is already an experienced England international with 33 caps and 14 goals. He was only 18, remember, when he burst on to the global stage with that outstanding piece of individualism to score against Argentina in St Etienne in the 1998 World Cup. And even then, in spite of the occasional impetuous tackle on the pitch, he was conducting himself off it with a maturity well beyond his years. \"He has a lot of qualities to be a good captain,\" Eriksson observed. \"He is a good picture, a good window - what do you say? - a good ambassador. \"I'm not a moralist. I'm not saying that you have to go to church on Sunday mornings to be captain of England, certainly not. But if there has to be an ambassador for football, why not Owen?\" Why not indeed, although far from ending the speculation about a likely alternative to Beckham as World Cup captain, the choice of Owen for tonight will intensify it. It is possible Eriksson intended giving Sol Campbell the armband until the Arsenal centre-back tore a hamstring on Sunday. Rio Ferdinand, another absentee tonight, has also been mentioned although at the moment being captain of Leeds United is rather like skippering a pirate ship. Gary Neville was the strongest bet because of his seniority and the fact that he is more likely than Southgate to be a regular choice in the World Cup. Eriksson may have had another motive in making Owen captain for the last home friendly before they leave for the Far East, by which time he will have announced his squad. He wants to see more commitment tonight than some of his players showed in losing 2-1 to Italy three weeks ago and perhaps feels, with Owen leading the team as well as the attack, the missing spark will return. \"I would like us to have the right attitude,\" the coach explained, \"like we had building up for qualification. \"It's not easy for the players at this time of season. There is a lot of pressure from their clubs. But this is the last game we play before we go to our training camp in Korea, so I would like to see a little bit of fire on the pitch, even if it is a friendly.\" Although Beckham, Ferdinand, Campbell and Emile Heskey are out tonight the availability of Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes, who both missed the Italy match, should leave England sounder amidships. A centre-back partnership of Southgate and Martin Keown, moreover, would hardly lack experience; between them they have won 86 caps. Owen's captaincy apart, the principal interest will be the role and performance of Kieron Dyer, fit at last for England and now earmarked as an alternative to Beckham on the right. Unless, that is, Eriksson plays him on the left, which was his original intention, and replaces Beckham with Owen Hargreaves or Trevor Sinclair. Up front Robbie Fowler, who gave England their brief lead against Italy, will be reunited with Owen unless Eriksson decides to have an early look at Matt Jansen, who missed training yesterday with a stomach upset. But he surely needs to field as strong a team as possible for at least 45 minutes if this match is to have more meaning than its predecessor. Eriksson has persuaded Paraguay's coach Cesare Maldini to allow him to use up to 11 substitutes tonight. The Paraguayans had initially objected to any more than six. \u00b7 The England squad have agreed terms over a \u00a35m World Cup bonus package , worth up to \u00a3200,000 a man if they win the tournament. The injured captain David Beckham, a member of the four-man players' committee, attended yesterday's discussions. England (possible, 4-4-2): Seaman (Arsenal); G Neville (Man U), Keown (Arsenal), Southgate (M'boro), Bridge (Soton); Hargreaves (B Munich), Gerrard (Liverpool), Scholes (Man U), Dyer (Newcastle); Owen (Liverpool), Fowler (Leeds). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
