This means that for me, cliff-jumping and the like is temporarily suspended which frustrates me a little, but makes me even more eager to work like crazy for a couple of months so I can spend the rest of the time racing round jungles with total abandon... sigh... My week started with my second job trial, this time at the prestigious five-star hotel I'd already had an interview at. It must be the most entertaining procedure I've been through to get a waitressing job, but there was a fun crowd in the waiting room with me, all hoping to start together. Besides seeing another four or five people I was also given a full medical check, which seemed fantastically over the top. The nurse happily informed me that I had a \"weak left wrist, not helped by being short!\", but besides that all was in good working order apparently. At the end of a few hours of interviews I was finally told I'd got the job - yippee! As jobs go this one should be interesting - the prospect of meeting big businessmen, celebrities or even being at a Jewish wedding await. Friday dawned sunny and bright, which fitted brilliantly with it being Australia Day, a public holiday commemorating the time when the First Fleet set up in circular quay, home of the Opera House. After a quick stroll around the beachside markets in Coogee, Brian and I headed to Darling Harbour which was more packed than ever this time with jet-ski performers, street theatre, countless stalls and holidayers in their thousands. That evening we had intended to return to watch the fireworks, but I realised I'd never been to a proper club in Sydney which, given the lively nature of the city, seemed a terrible omission. Besides, Australians are renowned for partying - my friends in Canada lived by the motto 'Go hard or go home'. So, I took Brian to Home, probably the best known club in the city, with three stories of glass walls overlooking Darling Harbour. I'd determined to dance 'til dawn, or at least have a decent go at it! The atmosphere inside was incredibly relaxed and happy. A bouncer told me he'd rarely seen any kind of fights because of the vibe there. One nice touch for me was a wash-room attendant who insisted on massaging my arms every time I went to the bathroom! I returned to my apartment at six the next morning, so I felt I'd pretty much fulfilled my aim, and had a great time with it. Saturday, although I made every attempt to wake early and achieve great things, by early evening the lack of sleep caught up with me. Kept in by a raging tropical storm that plunged the whole of Coogee into greyness I soon collapsed asleep, fully-clothed. The next day my thoughts turned to my friends Sapphire, Dave and Gary who left England today to follow the same route as me. Good luck, and I'll see you in Sydney! And I'll get to see how travelling with friends compares to travelling alone. I headed to Chinatown, central Sydney to watch the parade celebrating Chinese New Year (of the snake). It was a colourful event with dancing dragons and elaborately dressed Chinese ladies, but for some reason the audience didn't seem too enthused - maybe it was just Sunday morning lethargy. Meanwhile I treated myself to Chinese dinner to keep in with the spirit of the day. I met up with Brian and we made a snap decision to go to Fox studios. While we were there, a live MTV-style programme was being filmed for Australian TV so we sat to watch it being shot. It was then that an assistant came over and asked if we'd like to request a song - Brian asked for an obscure Australian band named Porkers, and the assistant then asked if we'd mind having a chat with the presenter before he played our choice!! We had about two minutes of interview, which went out live, and pretty much involved us discussing hostels and travelling. So, if anybody was watching Channel V at 5.30pm on Sunday, that girl in the pink top was me! Later that night a group of us headed to the Clovelley hotel to watch a live band, and Brian and I got recognised from our TV appearance - the guy even seemed quite excited to see us! So there you have it, fame at last! But when I returned to my room later that night, I found it had been infested with enormous cockroaches. Michaela had sprayed the room, leaving it full of dying roaches. I was just glad I hadn't been the one to discover them! Not wanting to sleep in my room, the two of us squeezed in with the couple next door. On Monday I felt the need to stretch my legs again, so decided to give the pleasant walk from Bondai to Coogee another try. I was quite surprised to find that doing it alone it took only half the time that it had with Josh, but then again I did stick to the path on this occasion! Stopping at the Coogee Bay Hotel, a man started asking about my interest in sailing as he was going to rent a boat. I like to think I've learnt something from my travels so I politely declined his invitation to join him and left - no more outings with random strangers! At 8.30am the next morning I went to the hotel for my first day's work, and it felt eerily like going back to school. A group of 10 of us, all on working visas, were given our uniforms then sat in a circle in a room where we were given name-cards and made to play getting-to-know-you activities! Our first day didn't involve any actual work but it did include a tour of the hotel, including a peek into one of the bedrooms. This $800-a-night room had incredible harbour views and a walk in bathroom - we all noted that it was a little nicer than our own present accommodation! The quality of service - room service tables, 24-hour laundry, overnight shoe-shine - just reminded me of a movie and I found it fascinating. The only drawback was that at the end of the day, having watched videos and filled out handbooks, we were all informed there was no work for the next week. All of us hoping to work there are in exactly the same boat, so this was pretty distressing. Quick tip for anybody hoping to work in Sydney - jobs are easy enough to come by, but February is a much better month to start looking, so I'm told. Wednesday saw torrential rain for the second day in a row which scuppered my plans. Still, I made it into Sydney to see if there was any other temporary work going only to hear repeatedly that things will be picking up in a couple of weeks. I hope so. I'm itching to continue my adventures again - in the mean-time if anyone has good suggestions for Sydney-based activities they'd be very much appreciated. Until next week, and who knows what can happen in a week? Milly"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
