The first was that she was an unusual, even unique political presence: a thinker but also a vivid communicator; a pioneering female cabinet minister; a middle-class liberal who appealed to the tabloid reader; a highly popular member of often highly unpopular Labour governments; and finally, a co-founder of an unprecedentedly successful new party, the SDP. The second thing the papers liked to say was that she would end up as prime minister. Such predictions are often made, but in Williams's case the persistence and tone of the forecasts felt significant. \"There are shrewd judges who believe that she has a prime minister's baton in her briefcase,\" wrote the Sunday Times in 1967. \"She is one of us,\" said the Sun in 1974, selecting her as its Woman of the Year and the \"most likely\" person to become Britain's first female prime minister. In 1981, even after Margaret Thatcher had beaten her to it, a Times leader suggested that Williams - \"no politician is more completely a democrat\" - would be better suited to the task. A quarter of a century later, some of these judgments look shrewder than others. Williams has not, and is not going to, become prime minister. Five months ago, at 74, she retired from her last formal position in British politics, Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords. The occasion received more modest coverage than the other important moments of her career. Yet in less conventional ways her reputation has endured and more. \"She's one of those few politicians who have seemed to grow,\" says the feminist and writer Susie Orbach. \"My ears perk up when she's on the radio. She has a consistency that doesn't sound tired. As the whole political tenor has moved to the right, her liberalism has become more and more interesting.\" The Labour MP and former minister Clare Short calls Williams \"a really wonderful role model. Her pure persistence and intelligence and reasonableness ... I get comments from people round the country: 'I hope you like Shirley Williams. I think she's wonderful.' In the Labour party, a lot of the hostility which persisted for Roy Jenkins [who also left the party to set up the SDP] just dissolved for Shirley.\" In 1993 she was made Baroness Williams of Crosby, but when former colleagues talk about her she is almost always \"Shirley\", just as \"wonderful\" is the first adjective they reach for. \"Charisma is an overworked word but she's got it,\" says the political philosopher David Marquand, who worked with her in the Labour party and the SDP and has known her for more than 40 years. Peter Kellner, another longstanding analyst of British politics, agrees: \"She has an utterly engaging belief in the power of logic, belief, persuasion.\" Whether there is a gap between these abilities and what she has achieved, and, either way, what this tells us about her, and about the nature of modern British politics, is the riddle of Williams's career. It is a riddle that nags at you even more on meeting her. She has started work on her memoirs, but the trademarks of the public persona of her heyday are intact. In the dim House of Lords tea-room, her gaze is blue and strong. She listens with unusual intensity for a politician. When she talks, her small hands are busy and expressive, lifting the air for emphasis, picking off points on her fingertips. And her famous voice, unusually deep and warm and sandpapery towards vowels, remains apparently tireless. Most recently, it has been heard in the Lords condemning the government's latest anti-terrorism legislation. \"I think it's simply terrible,\" she begins. An explanation follows that includes authoritative references to the political, racial, and moral disastrousness of repressive security measures in Gaza, Kashmir and Northern Ireland, each of which she knows well. \"All governments,\" she concludes, \"get increasingly persuaded of their own correctness. New Labour have become ... I wouldn't say tyrannical yet. But I've had several letters from people in South Africa saying the new control orders are like the early days of apartheid.\" Williams was born into a family alive with politics and vigorous convictions. She was named after the argumentative heroine of Shirley, the Charlotte Bront\u00eb novel. One of her grandmothers was a suffragette. Her father was George Catlin, a well-connected Labour activist, would-be MP and political academic. Her mother was Vera Brittain, the early feminist, pacifist and author of the bestselling memoir of the first world war era, Testament of Youth . Her parents believed in, as Catlin put it, \"that pitch of vivid living and working which is the keenest and divinest of all experiences in life\". During her early childhood, in the 30s, they lived in a tall house on the Thames at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. \"From Shirley and [her elder brother] John's earliest days,\" Brittain wrote, \"they met and mingled with all our guests, from cabinet ministers and international writers to members of local Labour parties and visitors of all ranks from India, Africa and China.\" Catlin was often away, working as a war correspondent in Spain and teaching at American universities. When there were no guests, Brittain worked in her study. \"She was completely uninterruptable before five - unless there was a major fire,\" Williams says. \"She wasn't like me in many ways. She was very much more disciplined. Very punctual, very well dressed.\" They were close, but there were periods of coolness and distance. Williams was an independent, confident child, and became more so when in 1940 she and John were sent to America to escape the second world war. Their mother stayed in Britain. Williams was separated from her from the age of nine to 13. Williams loved America. She lived with family friends in Minnesota: \"It was a lovely, simple, exuberant place to be. I just made my own world.\" She relished the airy midwestern outdoors. She went to a co-educational school. She ate a lot of candy and did not bother too much with learning. But she thought precocious thoughts about the wider world. In 1942 Brittain records: \"another letter [from Shirley] ... turned into a thesis on England\". The following year, passage home was arranged. With another teenage English girl, Williams was put on a ship that sailed straight into the worst Atlantic cyclone for a quarter of a century. At one stage, the lifeboats were swung out but the captain decided they were too flimsy to launch. The storm took five days to die down. The two girls also had to hide from some of the sailors who were, Williams wrote later, \"intent on raping\" them. When the ship finally reached Europe, the teenagers were interned in Portugal, as there were diplomatic problems and no Allied aircraft to fly them home. The girls were confined to a hotel outside Lisbon for several weeks; they filled the time climbing on the roof and sharing a bottle of Madeira every evening. \"It was a bit like Lord of the Flies ,\" Williams says. She hated the London boarding school chosen for her return. \"I was a pretty hellish adolescent.\" In other ways, too, it was not an easy time. While bombs and rockets were falling on the capital, her mother was writing and publishing a pacifist newsletter that attacked Churchill and called the Allied air raids on German cities \"atrocities\". The newsletter provoked fury: \"People put dogshit through the door,\" Williams remembers. But her mother's bravery brought them closer again. \"I really loved her after that,\" Williams says. \"When I left the Labour party, I was conscious of the stands she had taken. Although I never felt that what I went through was comparable.\" At first, Brittain was not keen on her daughter going into politics. The encouragement came from Catlin. He was a converted Catholic with a radical view of the church's social responsibilities, and an absolute believer in equal opportunities for men and women. Williams absorbed both belief systems. One seemed reassuring - \"Until the age of 18 it didn't occur to me that it was tricky going into politics as a woman\"; the other was a challenge - \"It seemed to me that, if I was going to be a Christian, I should embrace Christianity in its strongest form.\" She has been a practising Catholic ever since. \"I go to church most Sundays,\" she wrote in God and Caesar (2003), about religion and politics. \"I am, however, beset by doubt.\" She committed herself to the other great faith of her life at 16, the minimum age to join the Labour party. While she was still a teenager, she became the Labour agent for Chelsea. It was the late 40s, and the party of prime minister Attlee and the new welfare state felt full of transforming possibilities. Williams spoke at open-air meetings in Sloane Square, standing on orange boxes. In the evening rush hour, \"City types in their bowler hats would come pouring out of the Tube station. They would walk past hissing things like 'communists' and 'you are a traitor to your class'.\" For all her rebelliousness, real or imagined, she won a scholarship to Oxford. Even by the standards of that worldly university, she arrived as almost a fully formed public figure. \"She was a sort of star from the beginning,\" says Bill Rodgers, the Liberal Democrat peer, a political colleague and candid friend ever since. He was treasurer of the university Labour club; she was the first ever chairwoman. \"She would ask you to do something and you believed it was the most important thing in the world.\" In his diary, Rodgers noted her \"physical energy, friendliness and ambition, plus a vague element of sometimes straying from the whole truth which she would probably justify as a desire not to hurt anybody\". He adds now: \"She likes to be liked. Wants to say yes, to please people. She's always been highly competitive. Even if you're walking up a hill with her, she wants to be ahead of you. If you're competitive you don't want to miss anything. So she always has far too many irons in the fire.\" Disarmingly, Williams agrees - self-criticism being another appealing political trait of hers. \"I know my own weakness. My weakness is my strength. If you have unlimited energy, you take on too much.\" In her SDP days, she volunteers, some of her colleagues came up with an anagram for her name: \"I whirl aimlessly\". Often in her life, she says,\"I have been in a sense spoiled by too many options ... But I haven't really wanted to choose.\" After Oxford, Williams studied the role of trade unions in America at Columbia University in New York, worked for Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign, the Daily Mirror and the Financial Times, stood three times for Parliament, each time unsuccessfully, taught in Ghana, and ended up, in 1960, as the successor to Rodgers as general secretary of the Fabian Society, then one of Labour's foremost sources of ideas and talent. \"Our real purpose,\" she told a Sunday Times interviewer six years later, \"was to tackle subjects too hot for the Labour party to handle - for example, What's Wrong With Trade Unions?\" The wider political world took notice. The new Labour leader Harold Wilson had been a Fabian himself and was, by the standards of British politics then - and, tellingly, now - a keen promoter of women. After Williams finally won a parliamentary seat in 1964, when the party returned to power, her ascent was spectacularly fast. She was appointed private secretary to the minister of health the same year, and by 1967 was a minister herself, first in education and then the home office. Her voice, her air of informal confidence, her modern unfussy appearance, and above all her ease with different audiences made her a media and electoral asset for the increasingly embattled Labour government. \"Going canvassing with her is a nightmare for her colleagues because she gets stuck into genuine conversations with people,\" Marquand says. \"She's the kind of person in whom you want to confide your deepest hopes and fears. She is interested, she conveys this, and she doesn't leave. You're left standing there.\" In 1955 she had married an equally charismatic postwar figure, the philosopher Bernard Williams. In 1966 the Sun day Times described them as \"the New Left at its most able, most generous, and sometimes most eccentric\". The couple shared a big London house with friends from university, entertained refugees from eastern Europe and politicians from Africa, and drank sherry in noteworthy quantities. In 1961, they had a daughter, Becky. A dozen years later, Williams still had enough of a bohemian air to be stopped by police in her constituency, the commuter town of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, while driving a dirty borrowed Mini. \"They keep thinking I'm a long-haired hippie,\" she told the press, before adding with impeccably liberal sentiments, \"It is certainly very wrong if someone is stopped just because of the clothes they wear or if they happen to have long hair.\" When Wilson formed his second administration in 1974, he made her a cabinet minister. Shortly afterwards, Barbara Castle, the cabinet's other prominent female member, remarked in her diaries that he was \"singling out Shirley for special and repeated praise\". The newspaper stories about her becoming prime minister increased. \"I was excited that people were saying it,\" Williams says. \"But I never took that PM stuff very seriously. I knew it wasn't going to happen. I don't think I'd have been a terribly good prime minister. Or I would have been either very good or hopeless.\" It was becoming apparent by the 70s that she lacked certain political qualities. As a minister, she made a strong advocate for her departments but a less fluent administrator. Giles Radice, her private secretary in the late 70s and now a Labour peer, remembers: \"I'm not a very punctual person, but I suddenly found I had to become one. I realised that she was going to be half an hour, an hour late for meetings.\" Civil servants appreciated her quickness of mind, yet \"there was a certain reputation for indecision. She could see all the options too clearly.\" In the Britain of the mid-to-late 70s, with economic and political crises occurring at a rate unseen for half a century, there was little time for ministerial pondering. Williams's first cabinet position was as secretary of state for prices and consumer protection, a post created by Wilson to help restrain inflation. The political commentator Edward Pearce later called the job \"an illusion wrapped in a public office\". During her tenure from 1974 to 1976, despite praise from the papers as \"the shoppers' champion\", inflation in Britain reached its highest ever annual level. Despite this, in 1976 she was promoted to secretary of state for education. \"Education was a terrible department,\" says Bernard Donoughue, the Labour peer and former senior adviser to Wilson and his successor James Callaghan. \"Second-rate people. And you didn't really have any power.\" In addition, critics of comprehensive schools - for whom Williams remains a bogeywoman to this day - were gaining momentum. Finally, to make it all worse, her marriage to Bernard had collapsed. They had separated as early as 1971, but it took her three years to agree to a divorce, and several more to come to terms with what had happened. \"I was terribly upset about Bernard,\" Williams says. \"I went through a long self-examination.\" Bringing up Becky as a single parent much of the time, she adds, was not always compatible with maintaining a rising trajectory in the cabinet. Other ministers such as Denis Healey, Tony Crosland and Michael Foot got less good press but were better at the more private business of making alliances with MPs and dominating meetings. \"She would give credit to other views,\" says Donoughue. \"It's best to give no credit.\" Meanwhile, a residual, unspoken sexism also helped exclude her from Wilson and Callaghan's innermost circle. As other female politicians have discovered since, always being called \"wonderful\" or by your first name can be a sign of not being taken seriously. \"She suffered a little bit as a woman,\" says Donoughue. Williams says: \"I was never asked to join the inner chamber.\" In 1979, Labour lost power. More to people's surprise, Williams lost her seat. Revealingly, she seemed less upset than her supporters in the media. Unlike the most successful politicians, perhaps, she had other potential careers: within months, she was teaching politics at Harvard, trying television interviewing, and working at the British think-tank, the Policy Studies Institute. Like her parents, she seemed as comfortable being a political observer as a participant. There was another reason for her to feel sanguine, however. She had grown disil lusioned with Labour. Other party figures who, like her, were liberal on social issues, pro-European, and alarmed at the strengthening influence on Labour of the unions and the anti-European left, such as Roy Jenkins and Bill Rodgers, had been edging towards setting up a breakaway party since the mid-70s. Williams was sympathetic but reluctant to join in. \"Until the last minute I thought Shirley wasn't going to,\" Rodgers says. Unlike most of the SDP's early members, who envisaged a party of the centre, she retained an attachment to socialism. In 1981, she finally agreed to join, just before the SDP's official unveiling. Her idea of the party - \"I sort of thought it was a Labour party mark II\" - remained unchanged. Within weeks of the launch, the alliance it formed with the Liberals was ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives in the polls. In November 1981, Williams fought a byelection in Crosby, a prosperous suburb outside Liverpool with a large Conservative majority, and won comfortably. \"At that moment we really did think we were carrying everything before us,\" says Rodgers. \"I wanted, I think, to be chancellor. Shirley wanted to be foreign secretary.\" For decades, general elections had been becoming more volatile. Now, with Michael Foot and Margaret Thatcher, Labour and the Conservatives had particularly unpopular leaders. Williams and the SDP's sort of politics - approachable, intelligent, apparently lacking in divisive class connotations - seemed better suited to modern Britain. But this favourable climate did not last. In 1982, Argentina invaded the Falklands, the British recession began to soften, and the advance of the Labour left began to slow. In the spring, with her usual attractive, occasionally counter-productive candour, Williams told an audience of journalists and politicians in America that the SDP's support was \"frothy\". She went on, \"Sixty per cent of the party's new members are political novices, easily put off by the nitty-gritty and the infighting of the [political] process.\" In the autumn, hoping to help correct this, she became SDP president. But instead she had to watch and take part in the party's unravelling during the rest of the 80s. \"Because she was president she had to hold things together,\" Rodgers remembers, while the SDP split over personalities and strategy and ideology. \"David Owen [who wanted a more rightwing party than Williams] bullied her mercilessly.\" Donoughue perceives a repeat of her experience in the Labour party: \"She was as uncomfortable in the new thing as she was in the old.\" In 1983, she lost Crosby at the general election. She blamed, and still blames, changes to the constituency boundaries that she says were politically motivated. \"I thought it was bloody unfair, because I had won the constituency against huge odds, and I had worked terribly hard ...\" A trace of the temper occasionally mentioned by former colleagues enters her voice. \"It's the only time in my life I've ever felt bitter about being cheated.\" She contested Cambridge at the 1987 general election, but like Crosby and Hitchin, it was the sort of well-off constituency that she was suited to contesting but which was often going to vote Conservative. She lost narrowly. At 56, still younger than many government ministers, her political career seemed over. Looking around her Lords office almost 20 years later, that verdict still feels premature. Stuck on desk drawers and filing cabinets are hastily scribbled post-it notes: \"Lords Business\", \"Iraq\", \"Articles\", \"Lectures\", \"Biography/Memoirs\". Since 1988, she has been a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and a visiting academic, activist and informal ambassador from Ukraine to Brazil to China. She has remained a loud voice in the media. She has assisted the SDP's successful transformation into the Liberal Democrats. She did not stop teaching full-time at Harvard until 2001. \"She was probably one of the most popular people in the Kennedy School,\" says Professor Joseph Nye, one of the deans during her tenure. \"Students told me she was very warm and direct. She was always thinking. She never stopped.\" In 1987, Williams married the co-founder of the school, the prominent American political scientist Richard Neustadt. At his house in Cape Cod, they entertained guests in the generous, slightly disorganised manner of her Chelsea period. Neustadt died in 2003, but her travelling has not abated. \"It's lovely. There's so much to learn. I spend most of my life being excited. I have to come back to England to calm down.\" How much her career's perpetual motion has achieved remains the one thing friends and former colleagues disagree about. One school of thought says Williams and the SDP effectively created New Labour, by forcing the Labour party to change. Another says the transformation would have happened anyway, and more quickly, if Williams and the others had stayed and fought from within. Still others say such electoral and internal party calculations miss the point: her importance is as a politely iconoclastic female politician, an exemplary liberal internationalist, a rare practitioner of a franker, more thoughtful kind of politics. She herself can be downbeat about her achievements. \"I've been stuck with the same values for the last 50 years. I feel like one of those film backdrops of London which stand unchanging while, to show the passage of time, cars from different eras go by.\" The Labour party which she abandoned for being too leftwing she now criticises for becoming too favourable to the free market. \"I never thought the western world would move as far to the right.\" But her optimism quickly returns. There are still, she says, plenty of social democrats in Britain and the world. Gordon Brown, she hopes, may even be one of them: she would \"probably\" be more comfortable with him as prime minister. Meanwhile she expects her own party to go on winning new seats \"in clusters\". And then there is the daily stimulus of politics. She mentions an \"extraordinarily good\" Lords report about the anti-terror legislation. Her eyes light up with happiness: \"A marvellous report. Have you seen it?\" A few weeks ago, at home in Hertfordshire, where she occasionally stops work to walk up hills and to see her grandchildren, she tripped on a builder's dust sheet and fell down the stairs. She broke a foot. \"But I could have died,\" Williams says. \"I have been in a state of euphoria about it since. That's always the best way after these things.\" Leaning into her crutch, she sets off at speed down the Lords corridor. Shirley Williams Born: July 27, 1930, London.
