Amid fears that the government will be damaged by a Muslim backlash against the Iraq war, Mr Cook has answered pleas from a series of Labour MPs to visit mosques in their constituencies. As a highly credible figure among Muslims, after he became the only cabinet minister to resign on the eve of the conflict, Mr Cook has attempted to persuade them to put their objections to the war to one side and to remember what Labour has done for deprived communities. In recent months he has visited the Central Mosque in Luton, two mosques in Gloucester, a mosque in Rochdale, and three mosques in Leicester South during the recent byelection campaign. On the eve of the simultaneous byelection in Birmingham Hodge Hill, Mr Cook addressed 500 Muslims at a rally. He said yesterday that he had his work cut out to win back Muslim voters, who have abandoned the party in droves since the war last year. A Guardian/ICM poll in March found that Labour's support had slumped from 75% of Muslim voters in 2001 to 38%. Mr Cook, who described himself as a \"tribal\" Labour politician, told the Guardian: \"I have done many of these meetings over the past nine months. For reasons which will be familiar, I am a welcome guest in the Muslim community. [But] there is a job to be done. That is very obviously why I am working at it.\" Mr Cook, who was mobbed in the street when he visited Gloucester in April, said he was very frank about his opposition to the war, which had hardened in the aftermath of the \"appalling\" occupation of Iraq. But in his meetings he insists that Labour has a \"strong case\" to sell. \"There is a general recognition that we have pursued polices that have been fair to the ethnic [minority] communities. For instance, the stress in the Muslim community on the family relationship goes well with the very strong investment we're making in the provision for children. \"The big investment in education is very strong because Muslims are immensely committed to making sure their children get a proper education. On those issues, there is no difficulty in getting a response.\" While no Muslim had taken issue with Mr Cook on Labour's domestic record, he regularly heard criticism of the prime minister's handling of the war. \"Of course, there is dismay, not just among Muslim communities, of the prime minister's decision to take us to war on Iraq. The great tragedy for Tony Blair on Iraq is that it has become the defining issue of the parliament.\" The Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane last night welcomed Mr Cook's intervention. The Muslim Council of Britain also welcomed Mr Cook's tour. Inayat Bunglawala, the council's spokesman, said: \"The Muslim community have a lot of time for Robin Cook. \"The speech he made when he resigned touched a lot of chords and articulated many of the feelings many Muslims had about the lack of any substance to the government's case for war.\" But Mr Bunglawala said while he understood Mr Cook's support for Labour's domestic record, many Muslims would find it hard to support Labour. \"The Labour party has seen substantial support haemorrhage. It will have to have a sea change in its attitude towards the way it... has allied itself with a US agenda in the Muslim world.\" He added: \"Until there is some serious evidence of Britain adopting a more independent foreign policy, I do not see the Labour party regaining a lot of the support it has lost.\" Margaret Moran, Labour MP for Luton South, who is struggling to win support among Muslims after voting in favour of the war, said: \"Robin Cook was very well received. He does have credibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
