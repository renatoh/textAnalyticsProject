He looks remarkably unruffled for a man who, barely out of his teens, recently caused an astonishing bidding war among record companies. The desperation to uncover the next big thing means that such wars over new artists are an everyday occurrence. However, the fight over Trimble's band, the 22-20s, gave even jaded observers pause for thought. One dubbed it \"the A&amp;R scramble of the century\". Jeff Barrett, the man who eventually signed the band to his label Heavenly, remembers one gig where the bosses of every major American record label turned up: \"People were flying over on Concorde to see them, twice. I've been in this game 15 years, and they gave me more sleepless nights and grey hairs than any other band I've worked with.\" This is a remark that should not be taken lightly, given that Barrett spent part of the 1980s working with the heroin-sodden Happy Mondays. Anyone requiring further evidence that the 22-20s are destined for great things should note that Kate Moss has graced their live performances with her presence, a turn of events that seems to have become as essential to a hotly tipped band's rise as the obligatory string of demented music press reviews. They have had those, too: in the past nine months, their gutsy, blues-influenced rock has been favourably compared to everyone from Oasis to Hendrix. They have been variously described as the best British band in years and the sound of cutting-edge England 2003 - all on the basis of a four-track demo, one single and a handful of gigs. Given this insane level of hyperbole, you would forgive Trimble if he possessed megalomaniac tendencies or a nervous twitch. Quite the opposite. He's making the effort to look like a rock god - skintight denim flares, leather jacket, long hair and mid-afternoon glass of Southern Comfort - but that's about as far as it goes. His conversation offers neither the standard swaggering self-belief of the star-in-waiting nor the angst of a sensitive songwriter troubled by the music industry's machinations. Instead, he offers a kind of polite indifference, which occasionally seems like a defence mechanism against the sort of pressure that might otherwise have sent a 20-year-old barmy. Asked how he feels about one hack's overwrought description of him as \"the feathercut prince of the blues\", Trimble frowns, repeats the phrase slowly and inquisitively as if trying it on for size, then quickly changes the subject. Similarly, the bidding war apparently left him \"a bit miffed\": \"It just started to explode before we'd really had a chance to find out what sound we wanted to get. We were being taken to lunch every day, meeting lawyers, being told about these ridiculous sums of money. We heard a rumour that one label was going to get Bob Dylan to ring us and convince us to sign with them. It was absurd.\" It must have seemed even more absurd given the 22-20s' background. Trimble and 19-year-old bass player Glen Bartup are from Sleaford, a Lincolnshire market town where the previous star attraction was Cogglesford watermill and its ingenious labour-saving sack hoist. As Trimble gently points out, \"It's not very cosmopolitan.\" His musical education was equally arcane. While his school mates were listening to Britpop, Trimble favoured the blues records his uncle brought round at Christmas. \"Blues became this thing that me and Glen were into. We've never really got involved in anything else.\" Even today, his attitude to music is so reactionary that your average trad-jazz fan would consider it a tad fusty. Technology is out, \"mainly because I don't know how any of it works\". Artists who \"wave the flag for African awareness or the Iraq thing\" get similarly short shrift: \"I feel like it comes across a lot of the time as patronising.\" By the time they were 15, the duo were playing on the wildly unfashionable European blues circuit. (Drummer James Irving is a more recent recruit.) Trimble remembers the gigs as \"better than getting a paper round\", but not much. \"It was just cabaret, people who thought the blues was about the Blues Brothers, porkpie hats and shades. We were playing this Stones kind of thing and it was going down like a cup of cold sick.\" This odd apprenticeship left Trimble with an admirably surly onstage manner (\"I never wanted to talk to the crowd\") and enough money to record their demo. That fell into Jeff Barrett's hands via his Nottingham bar, The Social, where the band had hoped to secure a gig. Barrett, more effusive than his charges, recalls his initial reaction: \"Holy shit almighty, fuck, this is great.\" He says: \"It's a rare thing to get a demo that gives you that holy shiver. This one did. You could go round the pubs in London in the 18 months after the White Stripes and hear a lot of blues-influenced bands, but it was very rare to hear one and think, 'Shit, you're not just copying them, you've got some devil dust in you.' \"I went to see them play a gig the next night. I walked into this empty cellar and I couldn't see anybody in there apart from these three kids. I thought, surely not - I was expecting blokes. They told me they'd known each other since they were nippers, about the uncle with a blues collection and playing all these terrible blues festivals in Holland. I'm an old romantic - stories like that send me fluttering. At the time, they were still living with their mums and dads. I took them to the pub and said, 'You realise that your lives are about to change? Your demo is really good, even some dumb-ass motherfucker is going to sign you because of the White Stripes. Have you thought of what you're going to do?' Martin turned around and said, 'Jeff, we've only got seven songs and five of those are shit.'\" Nevertheless, Barrett was right. The pressure of record company and press interest was only heightened by the band's refusal to sign a deal until they had written more songs. They eventually signed with Barrett - \"Some people we met knew nothing about music, but he kept playing us loads of great soul records\" - and with high-powered management company ATC Management, whose roster also includes Radiohead. ATC initially chose not to promote them, but to try to calm the hype by refusing interviews. They packed the band off on a tour of unlikely provincial venues. While one reviewer was describing their limited-edition debut single, Such a Fool, as the work of \"the most important Brit rock band of the century\", the said band were to be found playing in rock'n'roll haunts such as Southend Chinnerys. Trimble describes this experience as \"awful - when we're playing to 20 people it doesn't work\", but it appeared to have the desired effect. The press's attention shifted elsewhere, at least temporarily. The band emerged from the tumult apparently unscathed. \"I'm pretty comfortable with it all now,\" says Trimble. \"I did feel the weight of expectation on my shoulders, but that's because we didn't have the songs. If I like what we do, then I'm pretty happy.\" The future is a matter of some conjecture. Their current live mini-album roars from the speakers, appealingly tough and cocky, but it is impossible to tell whether the band's career can match the expectations fostered over the past nine months. For the time being, however, the 22-20s find themselves in a unique position: they seem like survivors before even releasing their debut album. They have moved from Sleaford, to an Oxfordshire village called Milton. \"It's just a little cottage in the middle of nowhere. It suits us really well,\" grins Trimble. \"We like being away from things.\" \u00b7 05-03 is out on Astralwerks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
