Because northern people are fat and disgusting, and that's a fact reported by muscle mag Men's Fitness this month. Frankly, the news came as something as a surprise to the Fiver, which thought that eating coal, whistling down pits, walking whippets and pushing bicycles up hills to Hovis music blaring from gramophones mounted on gas-lamps would be a pretty good calorie shifter. But hey - the furthest north we ever go is on our annual Real Tennis outing to Hampton Court, so what do we know? Anyway, the same special-interest muscle mag that got slapped on its chiselled wrists last year for calling Fulham the 'fattest team in the Premiership', has noted that the 10 fattest cities in the UK are all up t'north. And waddling three places to the top of this year's list is Bradford, home of Dean Windass, one of the few footballers to look as though he is in constant danger of being suffocated by his own chins. Coincidence? The Fiver doesn't think so. \"Bradford has earned its title by consuming too much alcohol and takeaway food, watching too much television and not doing enough exercise,\" smouldered a radiator-stomached Men's Fitness suit, flexing his sculpted shins, guzzling protein from a tub with a picture of a bloke on steroids on it and welcoming us to the gun show. Now, as the Fiver's jaded legal team has pointed out, we're not saying that Dean Windass actually boozes and eats too much curry etc, so we'll move swiftly on to observe that Britain's second-flabbiest metropolis is Liverpool, where Robbie Fowler MBE has recently, quite literally, rolled back into town, thereby stabbing the city of Manchester in its oven-ready back and leaving an unholy cross-town alliance consisting of Wayne Rooney using Richard Dunne for ballast, to heave last year's fatty champions into an unsatisfactory third place. And so it goes on. And although, between gulps of our Yoga Bunny Detox shake (it's lightly carbonated liquid psychiatry balanced with ginseng and echinacea in a can), it occurs to the Fiver that blaming the fact that the north is porkier that the south might not just be because the fattest footballers are associated with teams north of the M25. Then again ... Kevins Davies and Pressman, Neville Southall, Tomas Brolin, John Hartson, Sumo Quinn, Paul Gascoigne and Mark Viduka? QED. Don't blame us, blame: Society Guardian * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Until you kick a ball in professional football, you can't tell me I'm not good enough for this standard. I think what you said is very disrespectful\" - no, not Harry Kewell's lawyers rebuking the Fiver, but Brighton striker Mark McCammon lambasting the poor-man's Spoony [Eh? - Fiver Ed] that is BBC Southern Counties Radio phone-in host Ian Hart, who claimed the player didn't deserve his place in the Seagulls' side. ********************* TONIGHT IN THE PREMIERSHIP: CHUFFED, CHAFED AND CUCKOO As the makers of Celebrity Big Brother will tell you, putting a random mix of \"famous\" folk into one small house can bring with it varied degrees of success. And forcing news stories about tonight's Premiership action, Petr Cech's new contract, Joey Barton's latest whinge and Robbie Fowler MBE's second Gissagong debut to cohabit in one small Fiver story has got two weeks in a wigwam in Alaska with Christopher Biggins, Nigel from Eastenders and Top Gear twit Richard Hammond written all over it. Still, with panto season over, Biggins has got nothing better to do, so we may as well kick-off the show, aided by our kind sponsors at Creakin Support Tights. The away end at Villa Park will no doubt be abuzz with the news that Petr Cech has extended his tenure between the sticks to 2010. \"I am very pleased. When I joined Chelsea I just wanted to get in the team,\" he said, doing humble about as well as anyone at Chelsea. \"Now I want some more trophies,\" he added, doing smug about as well as anyone at Chelsea. Joey Barton, meanwhile, will take time between filming L'Oreal adverts to play for Manchester City against Jongleurs FC. But while City fans took to their papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hate figures this morning, the in-no-way greedy player was quick to defend himself. \"I was made out to be very greedy. I'm slightly disappointed. I value myself higher than the club does,\" he said, hypnotising the Fiver with the glowing embers on the tip of his cig .. ouch! \"I'll always be 110% committed and there's no reason for that to change.\" Which just about leaves us time to remind you that Our Fowler Who Art In Heaven may make his return to Gissagong action against Bongo FC, an emotional meltdown that could put Vanessa Feltz and Michael Barrymore's BB house credentials to shame. \"I am just looking forward to putting the shirt on, to come into Anfield on match days and experience it all again as a Gissagong player. It will be something I can't describe. I am so looking forward to it,\" Robbie gushed, testing to the limit Creakin's \"holds everything!\" guarantee. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Eager for their very own version of Mary-Kate and Ashley, Blackeye Rovers fancy signing Martin Olsson's twin brother Marcus from Swedish club Hogaborgs. Middlesbore's deadline-day move for Marseille midfielder Abdoulaye Meite fell through because ... well, because they're Middlesbore. And Sven-Groan Eriksson apparently told a dining couple in Swedish eaterie Den Vassa Eggen that Guus Hiddink will be the next England manager. He obviously thought they were waiters asking for a tip. The Fiver has accessed a leaked report that suggests the Special One was ranked No6 in New Woman magazine's list of the 100 sexiest men in the world. Thierry Henry may have come 12th, Freddie Ljungberg 32nd, Michael Owen 64th, Weird Uncle Fiver 69th, Steven Gerrard 79th and Ashley Cole 95th. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Uefa suit Lars-Christer Olsson has called for tougher punishment and new Europe-wide legislation to combat racism in the game. \"We have not explored the powers we have at our disposal,\" said Olsson, stating the rather obvious. After patronising new Bongo FC signing DJ Campbell to within an inch of his life by claiming \"he's worked in a warehouse and knows what it's like to get up at the crack of dawn\", Bernard Cribbins has said he's \"a player who I'm confident can make the step up into the Premiership\". Which is much the same thing he said about Robbie Blake, in fact. Despite becoming the joint-most-sent-off player in Premiership history at Wigan last night, one-man Neighbourhood Watch Duncan Ferguson has yet to apologise to his Everton team-mates. \"He hasn't mentioned it,\" grumbled skipper David Weir. And English golfer Ian Poulter faces being fined by the European Tour's players' committee after wearing an Arsenal shirt during the recent Abu Dhabi Championship. \"I suppose if everyone turned up in the shirt of the team they support, all hell would break loose,\" admitted Poulter. Gunners midfielder Abou Diaby was unavailable for comment. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"Thanks for the letter of the day nod yesterday. However, seeing as I live in Norn Iron One-Nil, is there any chance of an alternative prize? There are no branches of Jongleurs here, and our premier comedy club, Stormont, is closed at the moment\" - Colin McCracken. [We'll send you a picture of Patrick Kielty instead - Fiver Ed]. \"Your article about Boro's transfer bid for Joey Barton refers to a 'verbal offer'. Did you mean an 'oral offer' or did you mean to distinguish it from a wordless offer such as one expressed by means of an interpretive dance or mime? Surely any offer expressed in words, whether written or spoken, is a verbal offer?\" - Mary Childs. \"Geoff Bradley (yesterday's Fiver letters) doesn't class Sir Stevie Me's 'mild ear-cupping' (as opposed to 'extreme' ear-cupping, I suppose) as an incendiary gesture. A significant number of Gissagong fans considered Jose Mourinho's finger-on-lips gesture as incendiary in the Rumbelows Cup final last year. It's time the FA published a list of body parts players and managers are allowed to touch without fear of upsetting the sensitive lambs in the stands\" - Mark Gillespie. \"Isn't it refreshing to see that an astute manager like Bernard Cribbins can base his transfer policy on 10 minutes of Match of the Day highlights. The only surprise is that he signed DJ Campbell and not Gary Lineker\" - Mark Cowen. \"In response to his weekly declaration that 'we're giving all we can!' may I offer Mick McCarthy congratulations for all his hard work. I'd hate to think he'd made our club a laughing stock without trying. \u00a31.8m for Jon Stead? Mart Poom replaced by Kelvin 'Flappy' Davis? Git!\" - Richard Halma. \"I visited one of the non-footballing Jongleurs comedy clubs last night and noticed they display a large notice at the bar threatening anyone that talks whilst the comedians perform with the door. Is it safe to assume Craig Bellamy heckled Souey during one of his team-talks?\" - Chris Hartley. \"Danny Murphy, on leaving Liverpool, made loud noises about wanting to work under an English manager. Do Tony Soprano's New Jersey roots somehow qualify him as English in Danny's mind, or did he make him an offer he couldn't refuse?\" - Nathan Smith. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. The best one each day will win a pair of tickets to the non-footballing Jongleurs comedy club of their choice (www.jongleurs.com). Today's winner: Richard Halma, who could obviously do with a laugh. * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO BBC1: Match Of the Day (10.40pm) \"Never mind Jeremy Paxman, Jeremy Clarkson should be the next England manager,\" writes James Smith. \"He hates the Germans and the French and he's driven the same fancy cars owned by all the players without getting nicked for speeding or crashing into a bridge.\" Sky Sports 1: Soccer Special (7pm) And while we're on the subject of fancy cars and tall men with curly hair ... Football First (10.30pm) \"Disregard Curbs and Big Sam. The next England manager must have international status and be unafraid to 'Step Into The Light',\" declares Ryan McDonald. \"It must be someone with a history of success in Germany, someone who lives to get his hands on big cups and someone who can provide their own 'kit'. Sky Sports 2: Live Premiership Football - Arsenal v West Ham (7pm) \"Step forward, The Hoff.\" You're On Sky Sports (10.30pm) You've sold us, Ryan, but Peter Stebbing begs to differ. \"The Bridge On The River Kwai's Colonel Nicholson, as portrayed by Alec Guinness, should be the next England manager,\" he what-hos. \"We need to restore some old-fashioned national stiff-upper-lippery. Setanta: The Hub (7pm) \"Just think of it: an embattled leader refusing to give up in the face of hostility, living only on pride and manfully completing a foolhardy and thankless task which ultimately costs the lives of many of his own men. Radio Five Live: Sport On Five (7pm) \"Which, if you think of it, sounds more like Graeme Souness.\" Talksport: Kick-Off (7pm) You're not wrong, Peter.
