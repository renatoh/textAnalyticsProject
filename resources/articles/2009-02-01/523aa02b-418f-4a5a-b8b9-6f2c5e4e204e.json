In an email to Conservative party members, activists and staff that was released to the media, the Tory leader said they already missed Ivan \"desperately\". But they drew enormous comfort from knowing that so many people had shared their grief at the loss of \"such a wonderfully special and beautiful boy\". Ivan, who had severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy, died early on Wednesday morning after being rushed to St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in London. He was the eldest of the couple's three children. \"Sam and I have been overwhelmed by all the letters, cards, emails and flowers we have received about Ivan,\"Cameron said. \"Sending an email this week just gives us both a chance to say a big 'thank you'. It means a lot to know that others are thinking of us and him. We always knew Ivan wouldn't live forever, but we didn't expect to lose him so young and so suddenly. He leaves a hole in our life so big that words can't describe it. Bed time, bath time, meal time \u2013 nothing will feel the same again. \"We console ourselves knowing that he won't suffer any more, that his end was quick, and that he is in a better place. But we all just miss him so desperately. \"When we were first told the extent of Ivan's disability, I thought that we would suffer having to care for him but at least he would benefit from our care. Now as I look back I see that it was all the other way round. It was only him that ever really suffered and it was us \u2013 Sam, me, Nancy and Elwen \u2013 who gained more than I ever believed possible from having and loving such a wonderfully special and beautiful boy.\" Ivan's funeral will take place on Tuesday at a parish church in Dean, Oxfordshire, near the family's constituency home. It will be a private gathering for close family and the medical and care staff who looked after Ivan. A spokesman for the party said the Camerons had been \"overwhelmed\" by the expressions of condolence. While unable to answer them all personally, they wanted to show how deeply they had been touched. As a mark of respect, normal parliamentary business was suspended on Wednesday as Gordon Brown, whose daughter Jennifer Jane died aged just 10 days in 2002, led tributes and expressions of sympathy in the House of Commons. In his own tribute to Ivan and the Cameron family, Michael Gove, a long-time friend and now the Conservative education spokesman, said his party leader's political philosophy and his attitude to public service had been shaped by the inspirational way in which NHS staff cared for his son. \"Seeing doctors, nurses and care workers, at the end of an exhausting shift, pouring all their effort into easing Ivan's pain has given an extra dimension to David's appreciation of what the public service ethos means,\" Gove said. Cameron is expected to take two weeks of compassionate leave before returning to his duties at Westminster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
