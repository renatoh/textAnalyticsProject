Elected its seventh president in 1980. Defining moments: \u0095 China and South Africa reintegrated into the Olympics. China returned after a 32-year absence to the 1984 games; South Africa came back in 1992 after the ending of apartheid. \u0095 The number of sports in the summer Olympics increased from 21 in Moscow in 1980 to 28 in Sydney last year. \u0095 Shamateurism was abolished and the Olympics were opened to professionals. \u0095 Only one city (Los Angeles) bid for the 1984 Olympics; 10 cities submitted candidacies for the 2008 games. \u0095 Over the past 20 years, the IOC has had TV and sponsorship deals worth more than $12bn (\u00a38.5bn). \u0095 The 1984 Soviet-led boycott of Los Angeles left the future of the games in doubt. \u0095 The 1998 Salt Lake City bribery scandal exposed widespread IOC corruption and almost forced him to step down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
