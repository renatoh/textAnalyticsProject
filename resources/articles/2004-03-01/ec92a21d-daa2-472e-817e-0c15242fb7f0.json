We said: \"In 2002, 44% of women aged 45-49 had this done for contraception ... \" What the statistics actually show is that, when asked what form of contraception they used, 20% of women in that age group said they had been sterilised, with a further 24% having a partner who had been sterilised. The statistics do not indicate what age they were when they had the operation. More women use the contraceptive pill, but there is a trend towards surgical sterilisation in the mid to late 40s, the ONS household survey showed. The proportion under 50 using the pill rose from 23% in 1986 to 26% in 2002. Over the last four years the proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds on the pill increased from 17% to 24%. Condoms are more popular, particularly among women under 35. In 1986, partners of 13% of women used this form of birth control, rising to 19% in 2002. There was a growing shift towards sterilisation of women or their partner. In 2002, 44% of women aged 45-49 had this done for contraception, compared with 35% in 1986; among women aged 30-34 the proportion fell from 25% to 13% over the same period. The trend may be linked to women delaying children and wanting to remain fertile until they do. Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association, said: \"The results are very encouraging in terms of the nation's sexual health. Women's confidence in the pill, a highly safe and effective method, continues to grow, and they are taking less notice of the many unfounded scare stories about it. The rise in pill use amongst 16-17-year-olds combined with increased condom use is particularly good news, as it shows messages about safer sex have hit home.\" \u00b7Between 1998 and 2002 households with CD players rose from 69% to 83%, video recorders from 85% to 89%, and home computers from 34% to 54% In 2002, 32% of households had a DVD player, 93% had central heating, 95% a freezer, and 99% a telephone. Households with access to a car or van increased from 52% in 1972 to 73% in 2002; the proportion with two cars or vans rose from 8% to 22%. In 2002, as in the past, lone-parent families were less likely than other families with dependent children to have home computers (56% compared with 80%), the internet (36% compared with 68%) and mobiles (83% compared with 91%). \u00b7Between 1979 and 2002 the percentage of adults with hearing difficulties rose from 13% to 16%. Men were more likely to report difficulties than women at all ages. About 4% of adults wore a hearing aid in 2002, but nearly two-thirds reported continuing problems. \u00b7 The Welsh are the most likely people in Britain to have a longstanding illness. The household survey found 38% of people in Wales did so in 2002, compared with 35% in England and 31% in Scotland. Across Britain as a whole, the proportion with a longstanding illness has increased from 21% in 1972 to 35%. The ONS said: \"These reports of chronic sickness are based on the respondent's own assessment. A high prevalence may therefore reflect people's increased expectations about their health as well as changes in the actual prevalence of sickness. Another possible contributory factor is an increase in the absolute numbers of people with severe chronic conditions who are surviving now compared with the past.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
