Age: It goes back to the 90s. And who won? Well, it\u2019s not entirely clear. One presents morning TV, the other wants to lead the country over the cliff. Why are they even in the same ring? Well, as you must surely know by now, during a live link to ITV\u2019s Lorraine from Good Morning Britain, on which McVey was a guest, Susanna Reid asked: \u201cDo you remember Esther McVey from her GMTV days?\u201d McVey used to be on TV, too \u2026 she must have taken drugs! This is not a drug story \u2013 it\u2019s about Kelly\u2019s response. Which was? \u201cYeah, yes I do,\u201d she said, before moving very swiftly on to what was coming up on her show. This is where Piers Morgan butts in? Obviously \u2026 try to keep Reid\u2019s co-host out: \u201cSo you got on with Esther then, Lorraine?\u201d And she told him to butt back out again and mind his business? Sadly, no. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember, love, I don\u2019t remember at all, it was an awful long time ago.\u201d Ooh, they hate each other! People have been comparing it to the Mariah Carey/JLo feud. Just remind us. It started in the 90s when Carey was asked, in a TV interview, what she thought of Jennifer Lopez, and she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d and a meme was born. And rumours of a feud that may exist only in the minds of fans. They have always denied it. Is it possible that Kelly simply supports Matt Hancock? How have you heard of him? No one has. I just looked him up. There was also the question of whether it was Lorraine Kelly or \u201cLorraine Kelly\u201d. What the hell is that supposed to mean? In a tribunal earlier this year, Lorraine Kelly argued that the on-screen version of Kelly isn\u2019t actually herself but \u201cLorraine Kelly\u201d. Eh? Basically, by arguing she was essentially playing a character (even if it is quite closely based on herself) she saved herself a lot of tax. That\u2019s outrageous! Also probably irrelevant, as Boris is going to win and he is going to cancel tax for all but the very poor. Very true. Also, she doesn\u2019t play \u201cLorraine Kelly\u201d very well. Certainly not well enough to pretend not to loathe McVey. To be honest, Judi Dench may struggle with that. Also true. It\u2019s not \u201cEsther McVey\u201d we\u2019re talking about here is it? No, just Esther McVey. Do say: \u201cTell us what you\u2019ve got coming up in your show, Lorraine.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cFight fight fight fight fight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
