Even then, traditional songs were only part of his repertoire, and they don't feature at all in his first solo studio recording in 13 years. As was his brilliant contemporary, the late Davey Graham, Renbourn is fascinated by a wide range of styles, and this instrumental collection proves his playing and range are as remarkable as ever. The self-written pieces are a departure from the Celtic influences in much of his work, and include the atmospheric title track (inspired by snow in Sicily), the melodic, easy-going Cirque d'Hiver (augmented by Dick Lee on clarinet) and Weebles Wobble, which manages to combine a cheerful melody with intricate guitar work. Then there's a ragtime piece inspired by Jelly Roll Morton, a drifting treatment of Erik Satie's Sarabande, a relaxed guitar version of Bach's Cello Prelude in G, a gently swinging Blueberry Hill, and (best of all) the assured and rhythmic Little Niles, by American composer Randy Weston. Renbourn is still breaking down barriers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
