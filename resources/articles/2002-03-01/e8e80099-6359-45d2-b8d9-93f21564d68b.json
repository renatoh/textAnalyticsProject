Baxter tested positive for the banned stimulant methamphetamine after his surprise third place in the slalom, but has vowed to clear his name. The process to establish whether he is guilty - and should be stripped of his medal - will be held in three stages by the International Olympic Committee. The process will take several days and no announcement is expected before next Wednesday. Baxter is expected to contend that his positive test was an innocent mistake resulting from the use of a nasal decongestant inhaler which contained levmetamfetamine, a chemical related to methamphetamine. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
