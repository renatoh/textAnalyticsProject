What a time to be alive. The band sound liberated, as Martin\u2019s hinted in recent interviews with Rolling Stone and the Wall Street Journal. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they sound good, but more that they\u2019re willing to experiment with new genres and styles. I\u2019m not entirely convinced by the pseudo-R&amp;B we heard on Hymn for the Weekend (track 3) and not deeply moved by Fun\u2019s arpeggiated guitar lines \u2013 but then again, I only heard 15 seconds of each song. When they\u2019ve gone for new-age indie, atmospheric spoken word and a bit of on-brand wailing, things have sounded better. Whatever happens come release day on Friday 4 December, you can always tell the grandkids that you were somewhere online, scrolling past a snippet-by-snippet analysis of a very famous band\u2019s very average-sounding album. With that, I\u2019m off. Look, I\u2019ll admit I cheated and listened to a ripped full version of this on YouTube. It\u2019s an X&amp;Y-era closing credits number, all about pulling yourself together after being crushed to a fine powder by heartbreak. Also, this is apparently the one that features Noel Gallagher on guitar, so there\u2019s something. Overall, this sounds like the track destined for cathartic post-breakup activities: packing up your ex\u2019s stuff, sobbing while scrolling through couple-y Facebook or Instagram pictures, setting their car alig\u2013 I mean drinking alone and giving yourself a drastically new haircut. And so on. Verdict: I\u2019m too tired for this. A rousing-yet-predictable 6/10. I can smell massage oils. There is the sound of cascading fountains in the distance. Someone is caressing my foot with what can only be described as an hibiscus leaf. I see the gentle glow of candles around me as I slowly open my eyes to discover that yes, Coldplay have treated us all to a trip to a Health Spa to wrap up our Amazing Day. Thank you Coldplay. This is the sound of super deluxe relaxation. It\u2019s hard to tell with such a small snippet of music but, considering NME sacked off their Coldplay liveblog three hours ago and everyone else is watching Masterchef so nobody really cares, I am certain this will be Coldplay\u2019s answer to Tubular Bells. Verdict: Tantric indie rock with a deep tissue groove. 6/10. A curious clip to opt for, Coldplay Social Media Coordination Team. It\u2019s almost as if you are trying to test us in these final stages of the liveblog. There is very little to ascertain from these 15 seconds other than a) There will be some emoting taking place on track 9, and b) Coldplay are about to join an esteemed list of artists who have also created Day-related hits: Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day, Take That\u2019s Greatest Day, Elbow\u2019s One Day Like This, Bill Withers\u2019 Lovely Day, U2\u2019s Beautiful Day. One Fine Day by The Chiffons. As I say, not got a lot to say about this track. Verdict: They say it\u2019s an \u2018Amazing Day\u2019 but there is just a smidgeon of agony in Martin\u2019s vocals, no? 5/10 I guess. I literally have no idea. Hello everyone. I\u2019ll be taking you through the drive-time section of the Head Full of Dreams liveblog. Consider me a meek, slightly anaemic version of Simon Mayo. If you\u2019ve been staring at this liveblog for its whole seven hour duration then perhaps take a quick break before we continue in order to ensure concentration levels remain high. Please do not walk away from your computer - just close your eyes for a few seconds. Maybe I am coming in a bit wide-eyed and enthusiastic to this whole process, but I strongly believe this track has all the hallmarks of a Coldplay classic. If I am correct, that is the sound of Martin singing the words \u201cgo now\u201d. The song title itself - Army Of One - suggests this might be a track in which Martin finds peace in solitary, single life. There is something very ceremonial about this 15 second clip - its alien, organ-like blast sounds like some kind of religious epiphany. Verdict: I think I am coming in a bit wide-eyed and enthusiastic to this whole process. 10/10. Everyone, welcome Harriet Gibsone to hell the blog Gibsone, our music news editor, is going to take over for a while as I take a long, hard look at myself after doing this for six hours. She\u2019s our resident Coldplay fan, so I\u2019d rather not spoil the album for her by making her preview too many songs. Have a look at her first-listen review of the band\u2019s last album, Ghost Stories, in the meantime. I leave you in her capable hands for now. Well, so much for Obama singing Amazing Grace. This little sliver of Kaleidoscope is all atmospheric synths, piano and what could be a glockenspiel underneath the US president speaking. This sounds more like an interlude than a full song, and perhaps only runs to a minute or so on the actual album. Of course, lest we forget, we\u2019ll have to wait until release day next Friday to know that for sure. So far, this is reminiscent of the Cinematic Orchestra or Sigur R\u00f3s when they get all pensive. Verdict: Obama\u2019s speaking voice is like a wonderful bed made of treacle that I want to drown in \u2013 is that weird? \u2013 so I\u2019m on board with this. 8/10 Fun. Is this fun to you, Coldplay? A snippet of poppy electric guitar and four kick drum-style thumps? This song features Swedish singer-songwriter Tove Lo, though you can\u2019t tell that from the 15 seconds on offer here. Hopefully, if she co-wrote this, she\u2019ll have left her melodic and catchy stamp all over it. Otherwise, we\u2019ve got some arpeggios, an uplifting chord progression and a guitar that sounds like it was played in a giant fish tank. That would be more fun than this, surely. An aquarium. That sounds like actual fun. Someone get me to an aquarium, please. Verdict: This sounds well on its way to sappy ballad territory. Coldplay are best when they\u2019re sad and raw, not sad and limp. 4/10 Yes, we\u2019ve reached peak Instagram teaser We\u2019re at the halfway mark of this hourly ordeal campaign. I\u2019ve drifted from excitement (\u201can album\u2019s worth of teasers in an hour, cool\u201d) to surprise (\u201cwait, one song per hour? That \u2026 can\u2019t be right\u201d) to quiet resignation. While Coldplay are a hugely successful pop-rock act, this approach may end up feeling like more of a cruel tease than a fun one. Fans just want to hear the real thing when the album\u2019s released on Friday 4 December. For non-fans, it\u2019s a reminder of tiny sections of music they know they don\u2019t like. Elsewhere this year, Justin Bieber used Instagram hints to whip up excitement around album Purpose and its singles Sorry and What Do U Mean. He enlisted the help of other famouses, getting various celebrities to hold up a sign stating the number of days left before his music was released. It was a simple, visual tactic, buoyed by its capacity to rope in the demographics of other people\u2019s fans. Singer Ariana Grande also used visuals and audio to tease her October single, Focus, on social media. She\u2019d count down the days until the song\u2019s release, using promo pictures, gifs and video snippets. But hourly, rather than daily updates? They feel as though Coldplay are out to test their fans\u2019 patience a bit. If you\u2019re a fan and plan on sticking with the drip-feed until 10pm GMT, please do comment or tweet me at @Guardianmusic or @tnm___. I\u2019m keen to hear what you make of the experience so far. Leon Milk, below, has this to say: We shared track 5, Adventure of a Lifetime, in this blog\u2019s opening post so I won\u2019t bludgeon you with the same song twice. Instead, enjoy this ridiculous behind-the-scenes footage of Martin and co, making the video for Adventure of a Lifetime. Coldplay are currently obsessed with gorillas, for reasons I do not understand. Please share your theories with me in the comments. If nothing else, your thoughts would slightly shake up the drudgery of waiting for another 15 seconds of music. Oof. This one sounds the most like the Coldplay we know, but it\u2019s also slightly shrill. I wonder what the everglow that Martin \u201clives for\u201d might be? That feeling when you step into the Tube carriage that perfectly spits you out at the exit? When you wake up and are like: \u2018dammit, another day at work,\u2019 then remember it\u2019s Saturday? Finding a non-discontinued 50p coin down the back of the sofa? Whatever he\u2019s singing about, he\u2019s howling into the wind like a baby seal that\u2019s been through a divorce and come out on the other side, smiling. Fair enough. UPDATE: This song features Martin\u2019s ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow on backing vocals, according to a recent Wall Street Journal interview. Conscious uncoupling sounds amicable, doesn\u2019t it? Verdict: Lighters-up, swaying side to side, standard Coldplay. 7/10 Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s arrived, singing with Chris Martin about symphonies on this slice of heavily processed R&amp;B-pop. If this is Martin\u2019s idea of the weekend, then maybe we should concerned. But in any case, we\u2019ve got some programmed horns and handclaps and a pounding bassline that sounds like something J Lo would have done in 2003. Here\u2019s a bit of what Martin had to say about Beyonc\u00e9, speaking on London radio station Magic. The band roped Bey in to do backing vocals on a few songs \u2013 \u201cthree, really\u201d \u2013 according to the frontman. \u201cBut she is just wonderful, as you know, and she was so sweet, and I said: \u2018Is there any chance you would come and help us do some, you know, backing vocals?\u2019 \u201cOn one song, Hymn For The Weekend, I said: \u2018Could this be a bit more of a duet?\u2019 and we just \u2013 she was just so lovely to watch sing. She\u2019s so good, it\u2019s insane.\u201d There you go. Verdict: Look, I like Beyonc\u00e9 as much as the next person, but this sounds tinny and reminiscent of 00s bubblegum pop. 5/10 Birds continues the sort of upbeat, sunny electropop we\u2019ve heard so far on Adventure of a Lifetime and the 15 seconds we\u2019ve been given of A Head Full of Dreams. Martin\u2019s mumbling seductively now, though I\u2019d need a lyric sheet to confirm whether he is in fact saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this moment / You and me / Go to your muffin / The geography.\u201d Probably not. This sounds a bit like Friendly Fires on a comedown, shooting for sonic poptimism but dragged down by a reflective and slightly mopey vocal. My colleague Harriet Gibsone\u2019s hearing elements of Here We Go Magic\u2019s Make Up Your Mind. \u201cCould this be Coldplay\u2019s first krautrock-inspired track?\u201d she asks. You be the judge. Verdict: Hey, as far as 15 seconds of shimmery guitar and vocals go, it\u2019s not bad. 6/10 Forget what I said earlier about middle-class politeness. The band are in fact eking this process out for 10 hours, sharing one snippet per hour. I repeat: this process is set to go on until 10pm GMT. With that in mind, I\u2019m going to get back to doing my normal day job and I\u2019d implore all the excited fans (and other less excited readers) to do the same. Check back in with me every hour, for my undoubtedly rigorous analysis of each 15 seconds of sound that Coldplay decide to share. See you back at about 1pm GMT. In the meantime, here\u2019s a photo of Chris Martin giggling with people in gorilla suits at Sunday evening\u2019s American Music Awards. Will we get to hear Barack Obama sing on the album? According to the Sun and New York Times, Coldplay may have secured a sample of the US president singing Amazing Grace, to use on song Kaleidoscope. The audio comes from Obama\u2019s speech at the funeral for South Carolina state senator Clementa Pinckney, one of the nine people killed in a church by a gunman in June. Watch the original video below, while we wait for the next truly engrossing 15 seconds of music. Right, so here\u2019s a snippet of singer Chris Martin shouting on the album\u2019s title track. This sounds like the sort of festival singalong fare that\u2019s become the band\u2019s calling card since they stopped sounding sad and shy in 2002. There are hints of Mylo Xyloto\u2019s Every Teardrop is a Waterfall here, too: a slightly corny chord progression and a smattering of electropop. \u201cTropical-pop\u201d says my colleague Tim Jonze. Hmm. Verdict: Not their best. A stadium-ready 5/10 Well, they\u2019re dropping hints about teasing you True to polite, middle-class form the lads gave their Instagram followers a 30-minute pre-snippet warning. That\u2019s plenty of time to make a cupppa and mentally prepare for about, er, 1/12th of each song. Everything\u2019s set to kick off at 12pm GMT. In the meantime, see the album tracklist above. Note: track 10 is actually called Colour Spectrum, for those not well-versed in the language of rainbows. Coldplay are teasing you! Chris Martin and friends have announced that they will be taking to Instagram to play 15 second-clips of every track from their new album A Head Full of Cold Dreams. In your service, we are going to listen to each 15-second clip and present it here. They\u2019ve already let the world hear their disco-tinged new single, Adventure of a Lifetime, so they might actually not bother with 15 seconds of that one. Well, they call it disco-tinged, but it sounds a bit like poppy Foals to us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
