Scotland require seven points from their final three matches - starting with Ukraine's visit to Hampden tomorrow - to seal what appeared a highly unlikely qualification from a group which also includes France and Italy. Weir, who has returned to the national set-up after becoming disillusioned under Berti Vogts, spoke yesterday of the disappointment that will set in if the Scots cannot maintain their position within the top two in Group B. \"We will have failed by not qualifying,\" said the Rangers defender. \"That's why we are in the group, to reach the finals, and we will be failures if we don't do that, especially having got 21 points already. I would rather be France, and have a difficult campaign but still qualify, than Scotland having a good campaign and not qualifying.\" Weir is one of only two players in the current squad who featured the last time Scotland played in a major championship, the World Cup in France nine years ago. \"We have got to get to these tournaments because, if not, it gets harder and harder to get there with the seeding system,\" he said. \"We have hung in there and now have a realistic chance and have to make the most of it. You do not get that many opportunities and now we are effectively in a three-game group. It would be a shame not to do it.\" Alan Hutton, the 22-year-old right-back who has been among Rangers' top performers this season, describes the 1-0 win over France in Paris last month as \"a night I'll always remember\" but is in no doubt as to how important tomorrow's Hampden showdown will be. \"It's going to be just as big as the France game,\" he said. \"Ukraine at home, it's going to be tough for us, but we've got the ability in the squad to do well, so hopefully we can pick up the three points and get a step closer to progressing. They've got some massive names, really good talent, so it's going to be one of those big games again.\" The Scotland left-back Gary Naysmith has recalled an amusing anecdote of the team's surprise victory over France last month. Naysmith was injured for the match and instead watched it on television at home - only to miss James McFadden's spectacular winner while attending to betting matters. \"I had put a fixed-odds coupon on for the night,\" he said. \"I turned over to Sky Sports News to check the other scores when I heard Gordon McQueen [in the studio] shout 'Goal!'. My initial reaction was 'Oh no'. Like the majority of people, I didn't believe it. Before anyone asks, no, I didn't bet on France.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
