Dempsey scored a 56th-minute header and Brede Hangeland sealed the victory nine minutes later following Simon Davies's first-half strike. West Brom and Fulham each have 22 points but the inferior goal difference of Roberto Di Matteo's team means they stand three places below. After losing to West Ham United on Boxing Day, Fulham defeated Stoke City 2-0 away and, although Tottenham Hotspur subsequently beat them 1-0 on New Year's Day, Dempsey was encouraged by the performance at White Hart Lane. \"We thought we could have got something out of the Sunderland game [which was drawn 0-0] and then we had the West Ham game which was a must-win and we lost,\" Dempsey said. \"We had to regroup and what better way to do that? A win away from home against Stoke, we played well against Tottenham, and then we took advantage of West Brom not being at full strength with three points we needed. \"The atmosphere at the club has just been fighting. We're in a situation and have to stick together and work hard and show our character on the pitch. That's what we've done. The West Ham game was very frustrating then everyone bounced back after that. I think we showed character and a willingness to move forward and win in the last three games. We have to keep that standard going and hopefully keep going.\" Dempsey admits that potential relegation is on the Fulham players' minds: \"You know what the situation is. Players look at the table and you see where you are. You sense it around the crowd with the frustration. But we have got ourselves out of the situation, it is a tight table, and we [have to] get on a positive run and keep it going because points are hard to come by in this league and in the last three games we have six. We have to keep going.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
