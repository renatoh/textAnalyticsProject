Paterson, who appears for his collection Landing Light, won the prize in 1997 with God's Gift to Women. The award, for the best collection of the year, is awarded by the Poetry Book Society, founded by the poet in 1953. This year's judges, George Szirtes, David Harsent and Mimi Khalvati, drew up a shortlist of 10 from 88 submissions. Though the shortlist is made up of mainstream publishers, Szirtes comments, \"We kept a particular open eye for new poets and we noticed that a number of small presses were producing interesting work.\" Previous winners of the prize, inaugurated in 1993, include Paul Muldoon, Ted Hughes and Alice Oswald. This year's winner will be chosen on January 19 next year, when the \u00a310,000 cheque will be presented by Valerie Eliot. The shortlist Nine Horses by Billy Collins (Picador) Manhandling the Deity by John F Deane (Carcanet) The Lammas Hireling by Ian Duhig (Picador) Minsk by Lavinia Greenlaw (Faber) Ink Stone by Jamie McKendrick (Faber) Outliving by Bernard O'Donoghue (Chatto) Landing Light by Don Paterson (Faber) The Brink by Jacob Polley (Picador) For and After by Christopher Reid (Faber) Hard Water by Jean Sprackland (Cape)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
