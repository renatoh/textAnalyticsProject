No side at any level will be competitive without some committed ball-winning forwards, nor hope to win much without decent half-backs. Transforming a good Test team into a great one, in turn, demands another essential ingredient: a top-class centre three-quarter or, preferably, a pair of them. For years this immutable law has held true. Just as Australian cricket was once synonymous with the scorecard entry \"c Marsh b Lillee\", so no Wallaby team-sheet in the 1990s ever looked right without the indelible midfield duo of Tim Horan and Jason Little. Sides containing Mike Gibson, Danie Gerber, Philippe Sella and Frank Bunce felt a similar sense of contentment. Such perfect centres can be defined as follows: players who make team-mates relax and opponents quiver with or without the ball. These multi-skilled midfield organisers - human filofaxes with pace and power attached - are particularly coveted now that backline innovation is fashionable again. When Australia's coach Eddie Jones predicts the next World Cup will be won by attack rather than defence, he is articulating what Robinson has already identified. Even the world champions cannot afford to sit idly by because the future is rushing at them. Hence the interest in how the fledgling England partnership of Henry Paul and Mike Tindall fares against De Wet Barry and Marius Joubert tomorrow. It takes at least two to tango in a Test-quality midfield and, compared with some of the other pairings around the world, Paul and Tindall are barely on nodding terms. England's World Cup final pairing of Will Greenwood and Tindall know each other rather better, and there are any number of young English thrusters - Jamie Noon, Ollie Smith, Stuart Abbott, Fraser Waters and Ayoola Erinle - in the queue. With Charlie Hodgson settling in nicely at fly-half, a certain Jonny Wilkinson must also be added to the list of potential No12s. In weighing up England's optimum combination, account must be taken of defensive aptitude, but balance is the key. Intriguingly, those involved feel the old \"bludgeon and rapier\" formula is less applicable than it used to be. \"It's not a Heskey/Owen thing, it's not as simple as one big battering ram and one handler,\" insists Greenwood, England's most-capped centre now resident on the bench. \"More vital is understanding what your partner wants and adapting your line of run accordingly so he feels comfortable. If he wants it early, give it to him early, irrespective of what difference that makes to your game. I think that's the key to a good backline, never mind a good centre partnership. There are a lot of sides with tremendous athletes who want the ball a lot, but you need selflessness as well. That comes from friendship and trust, not just things on the pitch. I don't know many great centre partnerships who hated each other.\" The former Australia coach Bob Dwyer used to wax lyrical about Gary Ella - \"when you played outside Gary, all you had to worry about was your opposite number\" - but others, like the England centre of the early 1990s Damian Hopley, prefer a beefier brand. \"I think Mike Tindall's hugely underrated,\" says the chief executive Professional Rugby Players' Association. \"People have been very quick just to see him as a ball-carrier, but there's a lot more to him than people give him credit for.\" Alternatively there is the trend towards the southern hemisphere-style \"second five-eighth\" - effectively another fly-half - which would suit Paul and Wilkinson. Hopley rates Paul - \"From a creative perspective I've always been a huge fan; he and Greenwood are exceptional visionaries\" - but agrees with luminaries such as Jonathan Davies that Wilkinson could end up at No12 outside Hodgson. \"It's all about the blend. Clearly both are world-class fly-halves and Charlie's footballing ability means there is a good argument to play them alongside each other. But if you did, you'd have to find someone to complement those two.\" Paul confirms there is \"a big difference\" between playing at No10 and No12 in Test rugby - \"At 12 you do get more time and a freer rein\" - but argues the modern centre has a tougher time than his predecessors. \"Backs these days have to have higher work rates. You can't expect the forwards to do all the bash because they get tired.\" He also reminds the romantics that the modern game is not entirely about instinct: \"If you get your communication and your spacings right you should be able to work with pretty much anybody.\" Inevitably, though, every centre views the game slightly differently. Tindall, for instance, believes the world's current dream centre pairing is Joubert, his opponent tomorrow, and Tana Umaga. Paul also rates Umaga, but picks the all-time legend from another code of rugby - \"I've played against Mal Meninga and just thought: 'Wow, what a monster'.\" Strange that neither of them mentioned Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll and Gordon D'Arcy, potentially the Lions' first-choice pairing next year. On reflection, you can appreciate why. 2004 - Henry Paul and Mike Tindall In an effort to freshen up England's back play, new coach Andy Robinson and his attack guru Joe Lydon have put their faith in Henry Paul, renowned in his league days for playing others into space. With Charlie Hodgson and Jason Robinson also buzzing around, Tindall's more muscular presence - he is also defensive captain - is needed to cement the mix. 2005? - Jonny Wilkinson and Jamie Noon If Hodgson makes himself indispensable over the next two weekends, what do England do next year? What happens if Tindall gets injured or loses form? If the management wish to stick to the established pattern they appear to be favouring - a footballing inside centre alongside a fast, hardtackling No 13 - an all-Newcastle pairing of Jonny Wilkinson (fitness permitting) and the highly-rated Jamie Noon is a possible alternative. 2007? - Wilkinson and Ollie Smith By the 2007 World Cup, Wilkinson could easily be a fixture at 12, sharing the decision-making duties with Hodgson. By then any one of several other midfield contenders could have emerged but Leicester's Ollie Smith - who will only be 25 when the tournament kicks off - has the class to make a demanding position his own, if he can stay fit in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
