The pair were teenage midfielders at West Ham with big question marks about their potential but, back in 1996, only one of them was blessed with self-belief. \u201cI never thought I was good enough to be there \u2013 I always felt inferior,\u201d reflects Hull\u2019s manager as he looks forward to Saturday evening\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round reunion when Lampard\u2019s Chelsea visit east Yorkshire. \u201cI was really young, 16, and I\u2019d left Belfast for shared digs in Barking. It was hard but the experience definitely shaped me into the person I am today.\u201d That man is a confident, affable, attack-minded, 39-year-old coach on a dual mission to return Hull to the Premier League and reconnect the club with its, until latterly, disenchanted supporters. Outside the training ground in pretty Cottingham pockets of lingering January mist make surrounding country roads hazardous but, occupying a quiet corner of his team\u2019s weekday HQ, McCann\u2019s vision is clear. He believes the seven-point gap separating Hull from a Championship play-off place will prove bridgeable after his players enjoy \u201ca nice distraction\u201d against visitors managed by an enduring role model once regarded as a beneficiary of nepotism. \u201cBack in the day, Frank proved a lot of people wrong,\u201d McCann says. \u201cHis dad was West Ham\u2019s assistant manager and a lot of supporters thought he only got into the team because of his family [Lampard\u2019s uncle Harry Redknapp was the manager] but, having seen the work Frank did every day, I knew different. \u201cFrank\u2019s two years older so we didn\u2019t really socialise but he\u2019d probably admit that, when he first went to West Ham, he was behind other players. He had the belief, though. He worked so hard it was unbelievable. Every afternoon he was out there with his dad, practising. As soon as he broke into the first team I could only see him getting better and better.\u201d Like McCann\u2019s former Barking housemate Michael Carrick, Lampard would play for England, but the Ulsterman\u2019s career followed a lower-profile trajectory. He emerged from those \u201cvery strictly run\u201d east London digs \u2013 \u201ca bit harsh but it made us grow up\u201d \u2013 to complete a handful of Premier League cameos before establishing a solid lower-division career, winning 39 Northern Ireland caps. After cutting his managerial teeth with Peterborough and Doncaster, Hull offered an irresistible challenge. \u201cI think it\u2019s a tougher job than Chelsea,\u201d McCann says, smiling. \u201cPeople have said I\u2019m not good enough but that\u2019s motivation; I\u2019ve been proving people wrong all my life. I come from Sandy Row in Belfast and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s made me tougher but it taught me good lessons about life. My family were relieved I got out because, back then, there were only two ways you could go: get a job or fall in with the wrong crowd. \u201cIt was difficult; there was bad stuff. The Europa Hotel near us was blown up and we missed it by seconds \u2013 all the windows of my mum\u2019s house came in. It was mad, the army were walking about the streets every day, but we didn\u2019t bat an eyelid. For us, it was normal life.\u201d Today violence has been replaced by vibrancy. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Belfast,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, an amazing place. I\u2019ve got three boys and we go back to visit family. My kids see the city\u2019s famous murals and think they\u2019ve got paintings of Fortnite on the walls!\u201d Harmony is similarly being restored at Hull after seasons of stand-off between the owners, Assem and Ehab Allam, and supporters disillusioned by some controversial commercial projects, most notably the team\u2019s failed \u201cHull Tigers\u201d rebrand. McCann has encouraged a mood of mutual compromise and is delighted Saturday marks the KCom Stadium\u2019s first sell-out since 2014, with many in the crowd hoping Hull\u2019s \u00a320m-rated forward Jarrod Bowen can unlock Lampard\u2019s defence. \u201cSelling out means a lot,\u201d McCann says. \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced more initiatives and open days. We\u2019ve lowered ticket prices and invited kids into the stadium. \u201cMore players are going into the community. We\u2019re trying to engage and the owners are coming to games after a few years away. I feel we\u2019re beginning to bring everyone back together again. That\u2019s the only way to be successful.\u201d He was not always so conciliatory. \u201cAt the end at West Ham I made a mistake,\u201d McCann concedes. \u201cI had a fiery temper. I\u2019d played about six first-team games coming off the bench when I scored a [freakishly spectacular] own goal in a 7-1 defeat at Blackburn. I remember Glenn Roeder [Redknapp\u2019s successor] saying he wasn\u2019t going to involve me in the next game to protect me from the fans. I didn\u2019t react well.\u201d A move to Cheltenham swiftly beckoned. \u201cLooking back, I should probably have stuck it out at West Ham,\u201d he says. \u201cBut me and Glenn are still good friends. Glenn\u2019s brilliant. We laugh about it now.\u201d Much as he likes and admires Lampard, McCann trusts his Chelsea counterpart will not be laughing on Saturday night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
