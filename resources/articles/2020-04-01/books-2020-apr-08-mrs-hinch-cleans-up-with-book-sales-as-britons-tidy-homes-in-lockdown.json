Leapfrogging Mantel\u2019s novel The Mirror and the Light and Walliams\u2019 new children\u2019s book Slime into the overall No 1 spot in the UK\u2019s book charts, The Little Book of Lists is a collection of \u201clife-changing\u201d lists about cleaning routines by Mrs Hinch \u2013 real name Sophie Hinchcliffe \u2013 who has 3.3 million followers on Instagram. The book also contains cleaning plans by the author and provides space for readers\u2019 own. \u201cFresh\u2019n Up Friday\u201d, for example, lays out tasks such as \u201cmake and spray bed\u201d and \u201cpolish/organise dressing table\u201d. \u201cNothing feels better than ticking off those boxes and putting down my crystal pen at the end of a productive day,\u201d writes Hinchcliffe. The closure of bookshops around the country means that true figures are unavailable from sales monitor Nielsen Book International, but available data show The Little Book of Lists the clear frontrunner. Fans spent \u00a35m on Hinchcliffe\u2019s previous books in 2019, said Nielsen\u2019s Philip Stone, with her Activity Journal making it to sixth place in this week\u2019s charts, and her 2019 book Hinch Yourself Happy hitting 39th. Another cleaning book, The Easy Life by Lynsey Crombie, Queen of Clean, also narrowly missed the bestseller charts, said Stone: \u201cIt seems cleaning has become a self-isolation boredom-buster for many in the UK.\u201d Hinchcliffe\u2019s publisher at Michael Joseph, Charlotte Hardman, said cleaning was becoming a source of comfort for people at home. \u201cThere is so much that is beyond our control right now, but cleaning is something that we can do, not only to make happy homes, but also to help ease anxiety,\u201d she said. \u201cSophie has built up an incredible community where followers can feel connected and together in this time of isolation. She is like a ray of sunshine.\u201d Stone said gardening books, language-learning titles and beginner\u2019s guides to musical instruments had also been climbing the charts in recent weeks, \u201cgiving a clue as to how many are spending their time in isolation\u201d. At Waterstones, Bea Carvalho pointed to \u201can unsurprising spike in sales of self-improvement books, and books which make the most of time spent indoors\u201d at the book chain, which is now only selling books online after all its stores were closed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
