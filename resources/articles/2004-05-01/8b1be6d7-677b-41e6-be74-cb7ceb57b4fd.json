Despite unpopularity over the Iraq war, Mr Blair remains privately confident that he is still an election winner for Labour and will lead his party into next year's likely campaign. If unforeseen events were to happen - personal or political - Mr Blair would back his chancellor's claims as the man best qualified to inherit the mantle so long denied him. Margaret Thatcher's manoeuvres to thwart Michael Heseltine - her obvious successor in 1990 - proved disastrous for her party, Mr Blair has told aides. In any case, he and Mr Brown remain personal friends and political allies - despite their clashes - unlike \"Maggie\" and \"Tarzan\", he emphasises. Such conversation within the Downing Street corral may reinforce recurring speculation that a \"Granita II\" deal has been reached between the tenants of No 10 and No 11 for an orderly succession at some stage, specified or otherwise. Only the two men concerned know for certain. Either way, loyalists and critics agree they are working closely together at present on Europe, public spending plans and Labour's crucial manifesto programme for a third term. \"There's not a cigarette paper between them,\" one leftwinger said yesterday. Backbench Labour dismay about events in Iraq was again evident during yesterday's Commons statement by Geoff Hoon. But it is far from clear that a majority yet want a change of leader. MPs such as Robin Cook, the former foreign secretary, and Lord Healey - the first Labour heavyweight to promote Mr Blair's claims over Mr Brown when John Smith died 10 years ago this week - are now openly speculating about the need for the prime minister to stand aside. Though more alarmed than Mr Blair by his problems, Downing Street strategists are optimistic that he can shake off what Mr Cook calls the \"very great difficulty\" of his \"mistaken\" war in Iraq. Under the headline \"Dump Blair or Lose\" a YouGov poll for the hostile Mail on Sunday suggested this week that Labour would fail to win a third majority under Mr Blair, but would win by 77 seats under a Brown premiership, albeit on a tied 39% to 39% share of the votes with the Tories. Most such previous polls have been inconclusive on this point. But after gruelling setbacks in Iraq, including the current military torture scandal, the MoS found support for the war has fallen from 60% to 43%. An NOP poll for the Independent found 55% of voters wanting British troops out by the June 30 handover. Some Blair allies want their leader to make a big speech that admits his mistakes, distances himself publicly from the Bush administration and is more open about involving Europe and the UN in Iraq. So far, Mr Blair shows little sign of wanting to do so, convinced that ordinary voters understand his goals better than a hostile media. Some advisers say he has not grasped how criticism has infected activists and voters ahead of the June 10 elections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
