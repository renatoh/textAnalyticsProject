Predictable masturbation jokes were made. Like Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d to describe her separation from her husband Chris Martin, or Mark Ronson\u2019s recent (albeit accidental) announcement that he was \u201csapiosexual\u201d (attracted to intelligence before appearance), any deviations from the limited language we have around relationships is met with mockery. This is a shame. We need more words, people! Being able to accurately frame our current experiences is part of being human \u2013 and we need more nuanced language to better tell our story. We\u2019re getting better at not labelling sexuality; at accepting that it\u2019s fluid, on a continuum and sometimes hard to categorise. But as the world, its politics and the fear of impending apocalypse change how we relate to ourselves, other people and our futures, we\u2019re still stuck with outdated and limiting language around romantic relationships \u2013 and around the lack of them. On government forms \u2013 and in life \u2013 there are only a handful of categories available: single, married, separated, divorced or widowed. What small boxes we place ourselves into when describing something so varied, so vivid, so integral to who we are. The words themselves come preloaded with expectations about the nature of the experience. Take \u201cdivorce\u201d, for instance: a harsh word with a lot of negative baggage. What if your experience is tender, careful, amicable and ultimately liberating? Isn\u2019t \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d more apt a description? And what if describing yourself as single is technically right, but you don\u2019t really feel single? There are so many ways of experiencing singleness \u2013 and all of them are valid. There\u2019s being single and actively looking for a partner: asking your friends to set you up, joining a load of dating apps. Shall we call it \u201cactively pre-partnered\u201d? There\u2019s being single and always wanting to be single because you love it. Let\u2019s say \u201ccommitted non-committal\u201d. Then there\u2019s being single and open to meeting someone, but not really pushing it. \u201cPassive serendipity-seeker\u201d? Or what if you have a range of intense emotional and/or sexual connections with people; connections that don\u2019t bring you into the \u201ccouple\u201d zone, but are nonetheless real and powerful. The language we have is wholly inadequate to describe something like this. How about \u201comni-emo-sexual\u201d? And then there is what Emma Watson described. \u201cIf you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you\u2019re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you\u2019re still figuring things out ... There\u2019s just this incredible amount of anxiety,\u201d said the Ivy League-educated UN ambassador and Bafta winner, in what some have pointed out is a telling sign of the times. \u201cIt took me a long time, but I\u2019m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.\u201d I see \u201cself-partnership\u201d as just taking some time out from the merry-go-round of relationships and \u201clooking for the one\u201d, and instead getting to know yourself a bit better. It\u2019s a good thing, actively seeking to be more self-aware; it can even prepare you for the next relationship (unless you\u2019re a committed non-committal, of course). But self-partnering is also just great in and of itself. We\u2019re stuck with ourselves 24/7; all of us are self-partnered for life. We may as well get to know and like the person we\u2019ll be with forever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
