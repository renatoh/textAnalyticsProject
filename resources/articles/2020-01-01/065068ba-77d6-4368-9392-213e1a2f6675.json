Doctor Who can and should lend itself to every possible type of drama, from horror to space travel to romantic comedy and everything in between. So there\u2019s absolutely no reason why it shouldn\u2019t do the same with the spy genre. In fact, it\u2019s a fine choice for a New Year spectacular. But \u2026 it\u2019s a genre I\u2019ve never really got along with. I\u2019m not a James Bond fan, I\u2019m a Doctor Who fan and I know I\u2019m not the only person who feels this way. That said, showrunner Chris Chibnall has tremendous crowdpleasing fun here with the genre\u2019s tropes, and Spyfall is far more spectacular and more assured than anything from the new team\u2019s first run-out. To recap: intelligence people from around the world are being assassinated for inexplicable reasons. So the fabled champion of the unknown, known to security services as The Doctor, is kidnapped along with her friends by the Men in Black via an exhilarating car chase. A charming cameo ensues in which Stephen Fry portrays Stephen Fry portraying \u201cC\u201d, the head of MI6, who recruits them to investigate the spate of killings, equips them with a Bond geek\u2019s dream cache of gadgets, and is promptly assassinated himself. The Doctor and \u201cfam\u201d go international tag team. Yaz and Ryan are drawn into the murky inner workings of VOR, the world\u2019s largest search engine, and plenty more malevolent activities besides. Chibnall is hardly subtle in his portrayal of big tech \u2013 \u201cLook! This is what you should really be scared of!\u201d he tubthumps. But there is no denying that dream casting Lenny Henry is marvellous, emanating just the right balance of evil and charming as the company\u2019s founder, Daniel Barton, who turns out to be just 93% human and in league with an alien race of evil nuns made from white light, hellbent on rewriting human DNA. The usual Zuckerberk stuff. The Doctor and Graham take refuge with \u201cO\u201d, former MI6 expert, now in self-imposed tea-drinking exile in Australia and a man who could help crack the alien conspiracy. O is a lovely, self-conscious chap who idolises the Doctor. Until ... \u2018Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh.\u2019 And the twist! O is no Romford misfit but the Doctor\u2019s evil frenemy the Master, reborn as a hot camp psychopath. My heart will always belong to Michelle Gomez as the Master, but Sacha Dhawan\u2019s Hot Camp Master looks like he will be terrific fun. It remains to be seen whether Chibnall can or will address how he got back from the end of Missy\u2019s journey. But his introduction did feel fairly rushed. Remember how brilliantly put together the reveal of Professor Yana was, as Derek Jacobi regenerated into John Simm? Or the intricate dance to reveal Missy\u2019s true identity? Here, they barely had time to jump on to the speeding aircraft before the Doctor called him out for lying that he couldn\u2019t run and the \u201cmwahahahas\u201d commenced. Still, there\u2019s clearly more to come, as long as they can all get off that exploding aircraft (spoiler, they probably will). Life aboard the Tardis The catchup with the fam was fun and a handy refresher as they explained their recent absences to their nearest and dearest. But it did rather dampen the central conceit that they have a time machine so the companions can return to the point they left as if they never went away. Graham seems to be getting through processing his grief for Grace, while Yaz and Ryan are growing closer. Right now it seems like a sibling dynamic, but romance isn\u2019t off the cards \u2013 especially after Yaz\u2019s refusal to give her amorous sister Ryan\u2019s number. Remember what happened last time there was hanky panky in the time vortex? Fear factor Last year\u2019s paucity of scary new monsters looks set to be addressed. But at the moment they\u2019re basically just nuns made of white light, so the jury is still out. Mysteries and questions As effervescent as Jodie Whittaker always is, the Doctor almost felt like a bit player in her own adventure here. But there are clearly bigger, darker things coming for Thirteen. \u201cSomething\u2019s coming for me,\u201d she warns ominously in the series trailer. And it\u2019s clearly something to do with Hot Camp Master\u2019s warning: \u201cEverything you think you know is wrong\u2026\u201d Yikes. Deeper into the vortex \u2022 It\u2019s nice to see the cold opens return. They felt missing last series and really give episodes an extra bit of welly. \u2022 \u201cMy name\u2019s Doctor. The Doctor.\u201d \u2022 If there were any awkwardness about Lenny Henry\u2019s recent comments about diversity in the show, you certainly couldn\u2019t tell at the series premiere. He spent most of the Q&amp;A gushing about getting to appear. \u2022 How are we feeling about the demise of Christmas episodes in favour of New Year specials? Next time! Will Team Tardis make it off the plane? (Yes.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
