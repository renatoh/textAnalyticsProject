Two decades of covering 'the world's trouble spots' and this is what I've come to - dangling a crapping toddler out of a car window. 'What are we going to do now?' says Melissa, my wife. 'Are we stuck?' 'Technically, yes. But we've got food, we've got water. The track's too slippery to go on, or back. We'll stay here while the road dries out and crack on in the morning.' 'Sleep in a car with two small children, surrounded by wild beasts? No chance. I'm going to call for help.' 'Hah,' I replied, 'it doesn't work like that in Africa, baby, you can't call the AA, darling.' In less than an hour my humiliation was complete. A ranger, summoned by the missus on her mobile, appeared out of the storm, secured the family in his vehicle and then led me out of the mess I'd driven us into. Safely back on track in Kenya's Aberdare National Park, I noted that at least we weren't in a minibus surrounded by sweating tourists. 'Yeah,' said Ella, six. 'I bet they don't get stuck and nearly die'. I concentrated on the view of Mount Kenya, inhaled the strong perfume of wet heather and marvelled at an elephant crashing through bamboo forest as colubus monkeys sailed from branch to branch. Most Kenyan safaris are far outside the budget of a non-banker. Cheaper packages are anathema to all that makes Africa so magical - they're planned and force one to share precious moments with strangers. A trip into the bush is all about freedom - and there's no reason why the averagely competent family and friends can't fill the back of a car with good food and booze and clear off into the wilderness. Our trip ended up costing about \u00a345 each per night. After the Aberdares, we continued three hours north to the Samburu National Reserve. In dry savannah it's bisected by the Ewaso Nyiro River which guarantees plenty of wildlife. At Samburu's Buffalo Springs campsite we swam and watched as oryx and impala drank at our feet. A good big fire at night, plenty of meat, spring-chilled wine, contented kids ticking off the cheetah, leopard, giraffe, and antelope in their guide books and I was redeemed in the eyes of the wife. I had feared the kids were a little young for this sort of adventure. It took another two days' drive to reach the easy-going and incomparably lovely Kamogi Ranch on the Laikipia Plateau, which we shared with friends for the price of a two-star hotel. But there was not a peep of complaint. The mobile was used once more. Ella took it as we crested a ridge in the Lolldaiga Hills. She said: 'I need to call God. This is so beautiful - I want to make sure he knows it's here.' \u00b7 Sam Kiley's latest film 'The General's War' will be screened on BBC2 this month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
