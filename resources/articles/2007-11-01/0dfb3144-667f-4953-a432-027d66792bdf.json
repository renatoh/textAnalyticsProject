Wes Anderson's latest is his most natural since Rushmore, a slight but tender tale of three brothers patching up their differences on a voyage of discovery through India. The sights and sounds are as beguiling as you might imagine, but the highlight is Owen Wilson as the self-destructive eldest, giving the film both its buffoonery and its heart. Sleuth (15) (Kenneth Branagh, 2007, UK) Jude Law, Michael Caine. 88 mins. Shouty, pointless retread of Anthony Shaffer's thriller, with Caine as the cuckolded writer taking revenge on his wife's lover. His solid performance in the face of a sweary script by Harold Pinter, flat direction by Branagh and a ghastly turn by Law just proves what a dignified treasure he is. Rescue Dawn (12A) (Werner Herzog, 2006, US) Christian Bale, Steve Zahn, Jeremy Davies. 125 mins. Herzog's return to fiction, based on his 1997 doc Little Dieter Needs To Fly, is a traditionally told but still harsh and effective story of one man's survival after being shot down over Laos during the Vietnam war. Cocaine Cowboys (18) (Billy Corben, 2006, US) 118 mins. Jaw-dropping account of the true-life 1980s excesses of the Miami drug barons, with lurid stories of violence and corruption that make the fictional Scarface seem a wuss by comparison. August Rush (PG) (Kirsten Sheridan, 2007, US) Freddie Highmore, Keri Russell. 114 mins. Passable kids' fare, with Freddie Highmore as an orphaned musical prodigy who falls into the clutches of a Fagin-esque gang boss. Jesus Camp (PG) (Heidi Ewing, Rachel Grady, 2006, US) 85 mins. Scary documentary about a group of Kansas kids going to an evangelical Bible camp in North Dakota, where religious instruction borders on brainwashing. Shrooms (18) (Paddy Breathnach, 2006, Ireland) Jack Huston, Lindsey Haun, Max Kasch. 84 mins. Pale, formulaic post-Cabin Fever slasher flick in which teens are picked off while getting off their faces during a magic mushroom binge in rural Ireland. Blade Runner: The Final Cut (PG) (Ridley Scott, 1982/2007, US) Harrison Ford, Sean Young. 117 mins. Though it's really just The Director's Cut with a few visual tweaks and richer sound, Scott's sci-fi classic looks better than ever. Wristcutters: A Love Story (NC) (Goran Dukic, 2006, US) Shannyn Sossamon, Patrick Fugit, Tom Waits. 84 mins. Engagingly weird and oddly touching romcom, in which a would-be suicide (Fugit) wakes up in a strange limbo. Talk To Me (15) (Kasi Lemmons, 2007, US) Don Cheadle, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mike Epps. 118 mins. Cheadle excels as jailbird turned superstar DJ Petey Green, whose radio show soundtracked the civil rights era and, less nobly, spawned Howard Stern. 4:30 (NC) (Royston Tan, 2005, Singapore) Young-jun Kim, Xiao Li Yuan Last. 91 mins. Minimalist drama about a young Chinese boy and the alcoholic Korean \"uncle\" who minds him. Out from friday All About Eve Reissue of the classic 1950 Bette Davis Broadway bitchfest. The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford Stately, self-explanatory neo-western, starring Brad Pitt. Fred Claus Xmas kids fantasy, with Vince Vaughn as Santa's snarky brother. Hitman Video game-inspired shoot 'em up. Infinite Justice Topical tale of a US journalist taken hostage by Muslim radicals. The Magic Flute Bard boy Kenneth Branagh turns his hand to Mozart's opera. The Nines Psychedelic three-in-one riddle movie, with Ryan Reynolds as a man facing an identity crisis. This Christmas Seasonal goodwill at an African-American family reunion. Coming soon In two weeks... Fantasy gets a new franchise in The Golden Compass... Richard Kelly follows Donnie Darko with his Southland Tales... In three weeks... Jerry Seinfeld gets buzzing on Bee Movie... Francis Ford Coppola directs Youth Without Youth... In a month... Bob Dylan bows out of his own biopic in the mindbending I'm Not There...
