And that's about it. PSV: Gomes, Ooijer, Alex, Bouma, Lee, Van Bommel, Vogel, Cocu, Park, Farfan, Sibon. Subs: Zoetebier, Beasley, Vonlanthen, Lucius, Addo, Feher. Arsenal: Lehmann, Lauren, Toure, Campbell, Cole, Ljungberg, Fabregas, Vieira, Pires, Reyes, Henry. Subs: Almunia, Van Persie, Flamini, Cygan, Senderos, Pennant, Hoyte. Hey Bobby, what's the French for 'bottle'? This is a massive game for Arsenal and their mentally fragile, technically brilliant crew. I fancy them to win it. PSV have nothing on Europe's big boys, but they are formidable enough, and gave Arsenal a run for the money at Highbury. If Arsenal lose tonight, their fate is out of their hands. It's a familiar feeling in Europe. Bah etc Production problems have rendered me useless. So what's ne-hold on a minute my sides have split. PSV's home record this season Played nine won nine, which is nine more than the number of emails I've had thus far. Useless eejits, all of youse. 5 mins Apologies for delay - I was just playing stick cricket. Went out in the semis to West Indies, as always. Meanwhile we had significant production problems, and Arsenal got off to a lively start in Eindhoven. No significant chances but a flowing opening to go with a storming atmosphere. 7 mins Long diagonal ball is nodded down by Sibon and Farfan, on the edge of the box, slams a volley goalwards that Lauren deflects for a corner. Jens Lehmann loves these... GOAL! PSV 1 Arsenal 0 Dear me, Jens Lehmann's had a shocker, and Ooijer has given PSV the lead. Fizzing corner to the near post and Ooijer, marching across the face of the six-yard box unmarked, rammed a header into the top corner as Lehmann, who was behind the line of the ball, flapped desperately at fresh air. 11 min Bitter blow for Arsenal, and now we really will see what they're made of - PSV have conceded one goal at home all season. \"Seeing as your webpage isn't working, any chance you can email your updates direct to my inbox?\" says Ben Jackson. \"Either that or give the techies down at Guardian Towers a good kick in the swingers.\" As we speak, Ben, there are nerds all round GU Towers wincing like Steve McMahon when - and this story may be apocryphal, but let's hope not, eh? - had his johnson split while defending in a wall at Highbury 11 years ago. 13 min Martin Tyler, who is in no way an Arsenal fan, waxes lyrical about Thierry Henry's outstanding record in Europe. Good one. 14 min Apart from scoring five goals in the first ten minutes, this couldn't have gone much better for PSV - Arsenal are having most of the ball, but they are happy to sit in, soak it up and sting Arsenal on the break. This is a really interesting tactical contest. No, it is, honest. And please keep refreshing to find out more. 25 min More technical problems, both for me and Thierry Henry, who finds the side netting with a great chance from six yards having made it for himself with a brilliant sliding tackle on Wilfred Bouma. 27 min No need to panic for Arsenal - a draw keeps their fate in their own hands (I think), and it's impossible to conceive that they won't beat Rosenborg at home. Henry is on the ball more, but Reyes has hardly a kick thus far. It's as incoherent as a minute-by-minute reporter on the pull after a shandy or eight. 29 min Fanfare, a surprise choice on the left-hand side of attack in the archetypal Dutch 4-3-3, has been very impressive: zippy and mischievous. Arsenal are having a lot of the ball now, though - they need their big players to come to the party. But Van Bommel is wiping the floor with Vieira in midfield. Literally. GOAL! PSV 1 Arsenal 1 Delightful goal from Thierry Henry. He burst away from Bouma, fed Ljungberg and roared on to the return back-heel to crunch it across the keeper and into the corner. 32 min Vieira is booked for a late challenge on Van Bommel from behind. Like Shane McGowan, it wasn't pretty. \"Keep it coming Rob,\" says John Hall. \"You've got us worried with that scoreline.\" Better now? 34 min Here's Thor Frette: \"Thierry Henry has never done anything of note in Europe or for his national team. He can't head the ball and the only reason he does so well in England is because Premiership defences are so poor. He is perhaps the most overrated player in the world. Discuss.\" Well, he's just scored a beautiful goal, and he's as graceful and naturally gifted a forward as I've seen since Van Basten. But there's no question that his record in the really big games - not games like this, the absolute do-or-die games - does not stack up. 37 min Bit of pressure for PSV, who are a real threat from corners, and the crowd are still going at it hammer and tongs, but you have to feel the initiative has shifted to Arsenal. \"I thought Menswear's last single of their first album, \"Being Brave\", was quite good, but what has they got to do with Henry, or are you implying he takes fashion tips from trumped-up indie fops who shone for one brief moment at the end of Britpop?\" asks Jon Eldridge. Nothing of the sort, Jon - that would presume that there is even a smidgin of subtlety or intelligence behind the selection of pictures/captions. Being Brave was a cracking song, though not as good as 'Piece Of Me'. 40 min Farfan thwacks one from range that is charged down like Sol Campbell. He took that like a man, all right. \"Can you please tell your audience how many times the TV coverage has shown Henry with his mad-at-the-world, I-need-a-laxative face thus far?\" asks Tom McDougall. \"I'm guessing three at this juncture, with the 'glare' after the goal...\" I haven't been watching, Tom, but I'm guessing about 742,234. As for his ridiculous celebrations, dear me. What's wrong with the Alan Shearer hands-in-the-air solo lap, eh? Think of the fans! 41 min Henry skins Ooijer and is taken from behind. A yellow card and rightly so. Like Francis Begbie, Pires's free-kick hits the first man. 45 min That's half-time: good stuff, and a fair scoreline. PSV roughed Arsenal up at the start and scored a well-worked set-piece goal, but Henry showed his class with a beautiful equaliser. A draw is good enough for Arsenal and, based on this, you'd fancy them to get it. It's a ker-acker \"Why in the world is Campbell starting over Cygan? Cygan looks so much better!\" says Hamilton Wen. I swear to you I haven't made this up. Someone, some wag - YOU KNOW WHO YOU F*@!*\u00a3 WELL ARE - has written in with this, this filth, this joke, and expected me to have nothing better in my inbox to publish. And it's worked. Shame on you all. In defence of a flat-track bully Here's Sam Farmer:. \"Inter Milan 1 Arsenal 5 - involved in or scored the first four; Arsenal 2 Man U 2 - League 02/03 Scored two; Arsenal 4 Liverpool 2 League 03/04 Hat trick.\" Hmm. I'm not convinced: the United game Henry was useless, with both goals incredibly lucky. Liverpool he was brilliant, yes, but with an xx-point lead (seven, I think), it was not do-or-die for Arsenal. And Inter: it's a fair cop, but one swallow and all that. I think the really important games - Juve away 01-02, Chelsea home 03-04, the FA Cup semi-final, United recently, etc - Henry has gone missing. And that's without mentioning his performances for France in the last World Cup and Euro 2004. This one could run and run, but frankly it's boring so we should about something more interesting instead. Like whether I should shave my pate or keep my (rapidly receding) attempt at a normal haircut. The anglophilic Emma Caddy from Belize writes \"The site was down when thing was due to start, then I got embroiled in annoying work saga and suddenly I look back and it's half time. WOTF?\" WOTF? WTF? More scores Barca 1 Celtic 1; Chelsea 0 PSG 0; Rosenborg 0 Panathinaikos 1. If it stays like this, a win in their final game puts Arsenal through. 46 min Here we go again. 47 min Consensus is that my hair should be made to disappear. Meanwhile, this is all very bitty at the moment - almost like a minute-by-minute reporter's analogies, some might say. Then Lauren gets booked for trying to get someone else booked. Serves him right; the youth of today, etc, etc 49 min Vogel shanks a shot wide from miles out. PSV have started the brisker, but they still haven't really threatened to open Arsenal up from open play. 51 min Palm-stinging hit from Reyes from 25 yards is pawed away by Gomes and Ljungberg, sniffing like Stan Collymore in a car park, bundles the loose ball wide. 54 min Arsenal should have had a penalty then, after Campbell's shirt was lifted in the box. \"Of course the Liverpool game wasn't a must-win thingy,\" thunders Hassan. \"After all defeat would have seen a nine-point lead cut to one in the space of two months.\" NO IT BLEEDING WOULDN'T. JESUS WEPT. 55 min Van Bommel almost plays Park in. Talking of which, if anyone has my iPod, which was nicked in a park in Clapton last week, be warned: Daddy's gonna get ya. Matthew Whittington is trying to e-crack on to Emma Caddy, even though he doesn't know it yet. \"Why anyone from Central or South America would be anglophilic is beyond me. Nice Weather, beautiful beaches, amazing birds, and great food, all things England seems to lack...\" I was being, like, ironic, dude. Caddy meanwhile has this to offer. \"It actually is too bloody hot to work.\" 58 min I've been attending to your emails so assiduously that I haven't seen much of the last five minutes, but the lack of non-Arsenal fan Martin Tyler reaching fever pitch suggests it's been pretty quiet. 60 min Absolutely nothing is happening now. I'm gonna start making up soon, starting with me stealing Cheryl Tweedy from the evil clutches of Ashley Cole. 62 min Blimey. Storming run from Van Bommel ends with a scrunching shot to the near post that Lehmann beats away at the near post. Van Persie is on for Reyes, who has looked really leg-weary all night. That'll be Gary Neville's studs, then. 63 min Lauren is sent off. He got himself booked earlier trying to get someone else booked, and now a ridiculous scythe at Lee brings a deserved second yellow card. Preposterous nonsense from Lauren. 65 min Henry almost gives ten-man Arsenal the lead. Marauding, leggy gallop down the left ends when he cuts inside and scuffs one towards the far post. Gomes smuggles it wide for a corner. Meanwhile, the wonderfully named DaMaRCuS bEaSLEy is on for Vogel. \"I say shave, then let Guardian staffers rub it before placing bets - which, from what I have read, you lads need some help with,\" chuckles Kevin Brady. \"I am sure the lovely Georgina Turner would jump at the chance.\" I'm similarly sure she'd run into a blazing fire to avoid the chance. 69 min Hoyte plugs the gap at right-back, replacing Pires. \"Thanks for the great job you're doing on reporting the game,\" says Chris Pateras in New York. \"Seriously.\" Who says Americans don't do irony? 70 min That's 55 red cards for Arsenal under Wenger, and here's my colleague Dan Jones: \"If your readers are interested I have just attended a historical lecture and was amusingly mocked by a man off the telly.\" I don't care if they are: I am. Come on Jonesy, don't leave us in suspense. Think of the fans! 71 min PSV are having all the ball now, as you'd expect, but Arsenal look pretty solid. In the early days of Wenger's reign they played with ten men almost every week, and few teams do it better. 73 min Arsenal's last red card before this was in February, for those of you who were wondering. PSV look as clueless as Sherlock Holmes after 44 whiskies, and Arsenal nearly take the lead when Henry coaxes a ball in for Ljungberg to shin a volley at Gomes from 14 yards. Those two have linked up well all night.75 min Real chance for PSV. Long drifting cross on, flicked on by Sibon, and Bouma, sliding in, just couldn't get enough on it. 77 min Patrick Vieira is sent off! Andy Gray doesn't agree, but it looked like a second yellow to me - he went to ground and didn't get the ball. Well, well, well. 79 min 4-3-1 now for Arsenal: whoda thunk it? \"It was Channel 4's Dr David Starkey,\" reports Dan Jones, \"who claimed he failed to recognise me because of (a) my 'new beard' and (b) your 'air of left-bank Parisien insouciance'. I can understand the first.\" I didn't get that far. 80 min Van Persie is stretchered off and replaced by Flamini after a clash of legs. In a sense these stoppages help: PSV can't get any momentum. \"I like combining min-by-min AND real-time footy,\" opines Emma Caddy. \"Now that is a rush.\" Oh what a life you lead in Belize, eh? 82 min Lee roasts Flamini - no, not like that honk etc - and drifts a nice cross to the far post that just curves out of play. Arsenal aren't anywhere near as under the hammer as you'd expect 9v11 to be. Yet. 84 min Another probing corner from Van Bommel is thumped wide by Bouma. That was a great chance; a free header eight yards out. 88 min Yet another corner is smuggled away. It's uncomfortable for Arsenal without being desperate, and a quiet crowd seem to have accepted their fate. 89 min A skidding low cross from Beasley is muffed by Lehmann; the ball drops - just sits there, goading the PSV fans - six yards out, but all the forwards' momentum was the wrong way and Lehmann jumps on it. Then Park's angled drive is deflected just wide. Tense times. 92 min Free-kick to PSV halfway inside Arsenal's half... 93 min ... comes to nothing. And that's it: Arsenal get their draw. PSV go through - Panathinaikos drew in Rosenborg - and a win at home to Rosenborg (a given, unless they bottle it again) puts Arsenal through.
