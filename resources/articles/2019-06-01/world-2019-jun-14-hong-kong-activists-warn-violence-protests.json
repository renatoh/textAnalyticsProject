Both his arms were red from an allergic reaction after he was pepper-sprayed by police at the mass rally against an extradition law under a sweltering sun on Wednesday. Asked what he would do if the bill was passed, Chan looked pensively into the distance. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get violent and it\u2019s wrong, but if the government keeps ignoring us, we can\u2019t rule out escalating our actions.\u201d After the end of last Sunday\u2019s estimated million-strong mass demonstration against the bill, which could result in suspects being sent to mainland China, the Hong Kong government issued a statement saying it noted the \u201cpeaceful and orderly\u201d march but would resume the second reading of the bill in the legislature on Wednesday as planned. An hour later, the scene turned ugly. Shortly after midnight, hundreds of protesters tried to storm the legislative council building, throwing metal barriers and bottles and rushing towards the police line outside. Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, Carrie Lam, condemned the violence and refused to retract the bill. At Wednesday\u2019s mass rally, which filled the streets outside the legislature and spilled over on to the dual carriageways in Admiralty, a downtown business district, at least a dozen, mainly young protesters, told the Guardian it was the government\u2019s refusal to listen that had prompted them to stage another rally. They said they simply had no other way to make their voices heard. Later that afternoon, riot police used rubber bullets, batons and teargas against protesters. In several cases, crowds charged at armed officers, throwing bottles and other debris. Some unarmed protesters were shot at by police and several were arrested as they sought treatment in hospitals. At least 72 people were taken to hospital and two were in a serious condition. Analysts warn that frustrations, particularly among the young, could boil over into even bigger and more violent confrontations if the Hong Kong government continued to ignore people\u2019s voices. After a long day of protest in sweltering heat on Wednesday, a young man and woman talked to the Guardian about their frustration and sense of helplessness in the face of their rights being increasingly infringed upon by China. On the subject of protesters increasingly resorting to violence, the young people, who declined to give their names, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d as they had exhausted all peaceful channels. \u201cIt\u2019s useless talking to them. They never listen to us.\u201d Ching Cheong, a veteran journalist who was jailed in mainland China for three years on trumped-up espionage charges, blamed the government for pushing the unpopular law in the face of opposition from groups across a diverse political spectrum, including the legal sector and even some pro-Beijing figures. \u201cThey have completely ignored all the peaceful, rational and non-violent expressions. The frustrations are felt across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThe students\u2019 emotions are just an expression of Hong Kong society. They feel there is no way out.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s government has taken an increasingly hard line on dissent in the years since the 2014 Occupy Central mass civil disobedience movement, jailing protesters and leaders, banning activists from standing for election and disqualifying elected pro-democracy lawmakers for flouting regulations at a swearing-in ceremony. Young people have also learned to be more protective of themselves than a few years ago. On the surface, the scene on Wednesday looked like the 79-day Occupy Movement in 2014. Volunteers were handing out food, water bottles, towels and snacks at makeshift supply stations, which also gave out protective gear such as face masks, goggles, umbrellas and hard hats. But despite the air of solidarity, people were reluctant to reveal their identity to reporters, refusing to be photographed and mostly declining to give their names and ages. When a Guardian reporter was interviewing a teenager in an underground station on Wednesday, his friends swiftly pulled him away. And unlike the Occupy Movement, whose charismatic founders such as Prof Benny Tai and Prof Chan Kin Man, or young leaders such as Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law often made speeches, no leaders have emerged in recent days. Tai and Chan are in jail for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and inciting others to cause a public nuisance. Wong, Law and Chow were sentenced to between six and eight months in jail on charges of \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d for staging a demonstration, although they later won an appeal. The NGO worker Isaac Tsang said the spate of arrests and jailings for involvement in the 2014 movement had made young people more protective of themselves. But at the same time, knowing that the government often ignored peaceful expressions, the youngsters increasingly believed they had no choice but to resort to radical actions. \u201cThis is a vicious circle,\u201d he warned. \u201cMore violent confrontations may happen and at this rate, it is a matter of time before the police use real bullets.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
