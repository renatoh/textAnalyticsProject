This, then, is the game that could see them become Grand Slam winners. How much would they love to do that against the English, against who they have a considerable emnity. Imanol Harinordoquy has admitted he cannot help but \"bear a grudge\" against England. As for England, it will be interesting to see how their new look side pans out. First: Lewis Moody, who will captain tonight with Steve Borthwick injured. He's gone from the bench in the last game to leading the team in this one and his style will not be one of nuanced tactics. Instead, Moody's is a body-on-the-line, beat the chest type of leadership. Would Nick Easter or Joe Worsley have been the better choice? We'll see. Toby Flood's promotion to the starting line-up is a deserved one but, really, Martin Johnson had no choice, so limited has Jonny Wilkinson's game been. Flood's suggested England need to \"go out there, forget about the result, and play ... the ability to express yourself as an individual is key.\" It suggests he wants to spearhead a new, attacking, flair-filled game. How will that tie up with Moody's more attritional skills? It could be just what England need to defeat the French - plenty of grit up front (and some in the backs with Mike Tindall's reinstatement), plenty of creativity behind. Or it could be a complete mess with the French - with their patience and incision - absolutely the best team to pick holes in any uncertainty or lack of joined-up thinking. It's worth bearing in mind that, though England have beaten France in their last four meetings, they have a score difference of plus 50 in this tournament, while England are 31 points shy of their lowest-ever Six Nations aggregate points tally. Teams France: Poitrenaud, Andreu, Bastareaud, Jauzion, Palisson, Trinh-Duc, Parra, Domingo, Servat, Mas, Nallet, Pierre, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy. Replacements: Szarzewski, Poux, Chabal, Lapandry, Yachvili, Marty, Malzieu. England: Foden, Cueto, Tindall, Flutey, Ashton, Flood, Care, Payne, Hartley, Cole, Shaw, Deacon, Worsley, Moody, Easter. Replacements: Thompson, Wilson, Palmer, Haskell, Youngs, Wilkinson, Tait. Referee: B Lawrence (New Zealand) Here come the teams: The noise in Paris is sensational. \"So, 'Imanol Harinordoquy has admitted he cannot help but \"bear a grudge\" against England',\" writes Gary Naylor. \"Me too, and I'm English.\" Anthem time: England go first. They adopt the arms-around each other, bellowing out of tune approach. Toby Flood, however, adopts the look of a man about to go over the top in the trenches. The French anthem is brilliant. And always has been. It's also a bit silly, which is how all good anthems should be. It's for charidee: \"My rugby mad friend Charlene is running a triathlon for Hearts and Balls, a charity that supports catastrophically injured rugby players, in case any of your lovely readers would like to sponsor her. She's managed to persuade three of the Scotland team so far but the more support she gets the better as she's dreading it,\" writes Eleanor Stanley. Commentary watch: How long before Brian Moore says something marginally dubious about the flakiness of the French? How long before he talks about England's passion to beat the Frenc?... Oh, hang on. He's just done the last one already. Peep, peep: England keep possession from the kick-off but lose it later when Flutey is flattened somewhat illegally. France kick long ... but too long and Ashton, on his debut, touches down behind the try line for a 22. 2 min: Trinh-Duc hoists a high ball up which Foden claims well. He hoofs it back and then France find a great touch about 15 metres from the England line. DROP GOAL! France 3-0 England France muff it up though. They throw the ball wonkily and England get a let off, winning the scrum. The referee, though, is being a bit fussy about the binding and eventually awards France a free-kick, which they take quickly. From the next breakdown, Trinh-Duc drops deep and slams a drop-kick over with consumate ease. TRY! France 3-5 England (Foden, 4 min) A sensational reply by England. From the kick off, they keep possession and, with two lots of quick ball, they work the ball out along the backs very smartly and Foden charges for the line. France 3-7 England Flood nails the conversion, a good kick from the touchline. Blimey, this wasn't in the script. 8 min: Nick Easter leaps the highest to win a line-out against the head. Care passes to Tindall on a crash ball run and England are pressurising France. They pass the ball along the backs, thanks to some great quick hands from Flutey. Cueto tries to chip through the French defence but it is charged down allowing France to regroup. A knock-on from England then gives the home side the scrum 9 min: Another scrum goes down and the referee gives the free-kick against England again. He's being very finicky about scrummaging. France kick long, then Cueto kicks it straight back at them and finds a solid halfway-line touch. 11 min: France win the lineout and fling it wide. Andreu nearly finds a way through, but is tackled by Ashton. A certain amount of midfield grinding then takes place before Shaw is caught offside. He looks injured too. Parra is lining up the penalty, slap bang in the middle of the park. It is also absolutely slating it down, rainwise. 13 min: Parra misses his kick. The ball eventually works its way back to Trinh-Duc, deep in his own half. He kicks high but not long, allowing Flood a chance to run back at the French. The rain has made everything slippery, though, and Flood loses the ball. 14 min: Here's Ian Copestake: \"For me rugby lost its appeal when Diego Dominquez gave up, so I don't have a clue what England's best side is. But I get the impression that many other people haven't a clue either.\" Least of all Martin Johnson on the evidence of this Six Nations. 15 min: France kicked long into the corner and England, via the lineout, won the ball back. They hoisted it high and Cueto mowed Poitrenaud down, who was under it. Cueto came off worse, though, but Simon Shaw conceded a penalty in which he injured himself again and he has to go off. Brilliantly, all of this causes an angry woman in the crowd to turn around and yell at Martin Johnson. 16 min: France are beginning to look more threatening and work the ball wide where, of all people, Servat is standing on the wing. He is bundled into touch by Care. 18 min: Tom Palmer is the man to replace Simon Shaw. Perhaps it's his influence but, for the first time, the referee allows a scrum to take place. France win their put-in and Flutey concedes a penalty for playing the ball while off his feet. This is kickable. PENALTY France 6-7 England: Morgan Parra is five metres outside the 22, in the middle of the park, and he drills the ball between the posts. 20 min: A preiod featuring a certain amount of hoofing it back and forth, involving some slippery ball droppage is eventually won by France, who earn a lineout just inside England's half. \"I think the angry woman [who was yelling at Martin Johnson] in the players' and coaches' section in the crowd is Jonny's mum,\" chortles Gary Naylor. 22 min: France win a free-kick after England narrow the lineout. They run it and find a wall of England players, who they drive into with a series of rolling mauls. This is getting into Trinh-Duc drop-goal territory. Instead, though, the fly-half chips the ball to the left touchline for Andreu to latch onto. Bastareud gets it, though, when it bounces off Ashton. He concedes a scrum to England. 23 min: The scrum is, again, scrappy with all sorts of dubious binding issues that infuriate Brian Moore. The problem, really, was that the ball had been put in wonky as well. So here's another scrum ... which collapses and gives France a penalty on the 22. PENALTY! France 9-7 England Parra is 10 metres in from the touchline, on the 22. The rain is pelting onto his head, and he strikes the ball sweetly between the posts. It's hard to remember the last time England were in the French half. 26 min: England win a lineout on the halfway line. They hang onto it, looking to drive, but it comes out to Danny Care anyway. He runs through the French line, chips the ball, and France claim it back. They put the ball into touch for another England line out, five metres inside their own half. 28 min: The lineout is won and, after a ruck, Care puts up a high box kick for Ashton to chase. But France win it back and, from another ruck, it's Parra's turn to put up a box kick. From it Foden is caught but England keep hold of the ball. Care has a kick charged down which, fortunately, falls to an English hand. They clear long and into the French 22. Poitrenaud simply takes his time and wellies it into touch near the halfway line. 29 min: There's some pushing at the lineout and England win a penalty for some (fairly minor) nudging, which is blasted into touch. France win it, kick long, England kick back and things get quite boring. Two French players are down, one is Parra and the other is the prop Domingo. 30 min: This rain has altered England's gameplan. From the first few minutes, it seemed there was a greater willingness to keep the ball in hand. The slipperiness of the ball has changed that, though, so it's being hoofed a good deal more. Which is a shame. 31 min: A lineout is not straight, so the ref awards England a scrum on the halfway line. It immediately goes down and France are awarded a penalty for a lack of binding. The England scrum have been awful so far. The ball is kicked into the England 22 and the visitors have again messed up a decent attacking position. 32 min: \"Depression has set in over here in Ireland after the Scottish defeat,\" writes Anthony O Connell. \"Even our top class pundits have lost it. Pundit 1: 'This is the worst defeat ever against the worst team in the tournament, I ask you when was the last time we lost to Scotland?' Pundit 2: '5 minutes ago and the better team won today.'\" 33 min: There is more scrum nonsense and Dan Cole is at the heart of it. England collapse the scrum once again, on their own 22 line, and France have yet another chance to kick for goal. England really need to sort this out. The ref is being very particular about it. PENALTY France 12-7 England: Parra thumps the ball over left footed. England have just ben handing France these points. 35 min: Parra clears from the kick-off, landing the ball into touch on the halfway line - where almost all of the play seems to have been. Well, the bits of it that haven't been on the England 22. 36 min: A note on the ref from Lynn Bashforth's dad: \"Watching with increasing frustration at Lawrence's bizarre decisions. My dad's latest text summary: 'He's always useless. Just does not understand the scrum laws. He was in charge of the first Lions match in SA and made a mess of that. Why do we have them?'. Would it be that hard to find northern hemisphere refs for northern hemisphere matches?\" 37 min: The rain has stopped now, allowing England to try and pass the ball about a bit. However, the ball goes down and gives France a penalty. Emerging from the ruck is Domingo, exhibiting a spectacular builder's bum with his shorts halfway round his aris'. 39 min: Trinh-Duc hoists a whopping great high ball into the 22. Foden is underneath it and about to claim easily ... until Cueto jumps across him for absolutely no reason. Foden, fortunately, ignores him though and marks. The ball is wellied into touch. 39 min: \"This question may have been asked many, many times before, but isn't Brian Moore just the most miserable, negative, whiney, commentator ever?\" posits Wendy Cooper, correctly. He's exceptionally irritating. Peep, peep: Finally England manage a scrum that doesn't collapse. From it, Flutey runs along the left wing as the time ticks over the 40 minute mark. There is good quick ball that allows the backs to do some running before Worsley (I think) loses it and France run a series of thrusts at England. Finally, England win the ball back and Flood wisely hoofs it into touch and the teams head in for half-time. \"Would it be against the laws, or even the spirit, of the game for England to come out in the second half gloved-up and wearing marigolds?\" asks Ian Copestake. The rain has changed things in the first half. When it was dry, England looked much more confident. When it got wet, their handling went to pieces and they made a number of mistakes that gave France the chance to kick a series of penalties. England must sort their scrum out in the second half. Some half time emails: Guy Hornsby has this to say: \"It's a funny game this one. We started with no real expectation of winning, even with our recent record against France, and came out like madmen, so it's been pretty pain-free so far. The rain really has spoiled things though. Our scrum seems to be strangely at odds. I don't think Cole is to blame for most of it, and he's getting singled out. But we're giving away too many penalties. 12-7 is pretty decent but we can't just keep handing 3 points to the French every 10 minutes.\" Phil Harrison: \"I cannot understand the appalling performance of this referee.\" He then goes on to say something about why he suspects the referee might not be much good which, if I printed, would earn me a swift clip round the ear from our lawyers, and a writ from the ref himself. Brian Moore, misunderstood: \"I have to serve a riposte to Wendy Cooper,\" emails Lynn Bashforth. \"Brian Moore can be a little gloomy at times, but largely because he has to watch some truly dismal English performances. In general, I find that he speaks from the heart, and explains things as if he were still on the pitch and in amongst them. The whole England team is bl**dy irritating this year. Now don't get me started on the oft pompous and antidiluvian Eddie Butler.\" Careful Lynn, that's my colleague Eddie Butler. Who I've never met. Peep, peep: That noisy woman in the crowd shouting at Martin Johnson is Raphael Ibanez's mother-in-law. Quite embarrassing that. England start the second half well, building a solid platform from which to attack - until Flutey passes the ball badly and France get a scrum. 43 min: Dan Cole is on the touchline with his hand in ice as England rework their front row. Wilson is the man on. Good thing too, the scrummaging was what has handed France most of their points. 45 min: Line out just inside the French half, which is stolen by France illegally and England take the free-kick quickly. The referee misses a knock-on, so England keep possession and run a series of crash balls. Easter is the man doing the driving. Then Care chips the ball over the top of the ruck. Had the ball popped up nicely, the England runner would have been over the line. As it is, England have a lineout five metres out. 47 min: England win the lineout against the head and can't make progress. They are driven back to the 22 by the French as the rain comes lashing down once more. Finally, Toby Flood tries a drop goal and his kick is a shocker - wide, short and scudding over the dead ball line. 49 min: Ashton breaks free and then lets excitement get the better of him. He only had Poitrenaud to beat but, with men in support, he chipped the ball over the French full-back's head far too soon. It gives the Frenchman time to turn, get back, and put a hand on the ball over the try line. A good chance goes begging. 50 min: \"Say what you like about Brian Moore, but he does at least have a bit of knowledge in the scrum department,\" writes Guy Hornsby. \"He's also recently done a referee's course as part of a wager so he does know the laws. He can moan and bleat and grind, but of anyone that's fit to dissect the laws, it's him. The referee's having a terrible game, missing offences left, right and centre, and we've been on the receiving end more often than not. Give me Moore over David Pleat or Lawro any day.\" What you say is dead right, but there's something about Moore's bullishness that irritates. 51 min: Tait is warming up on the touchline, while Marty has replaced Bastareaud for France. The big Frenchman has done nothing in this game. France then make their first foray into the England half and promptly knock the ball on, giving England the scrum. 52 min: The scrum stays up and allows Care to chip into the French 22. Poitrenaud grabs the ball and hoofs to the halfway line. Did I say earlier that Thompson is on for Hartley at hooker? I didn't? I must have done. Surely you just failed to read it. Ahem. 54 min: Tindall runs at the French in exactly the sort of way that Tait probably won't. So Tindall is replaced by Tait. Hmmm. Szarzewski replaces Servat for France. While I was typing all of that, the French run the ball across the backs and Ashton is forced into a good tackle on the touchline. Still, the French blood is up and they running the ball strongly at England. They make it halfway into the 22 and then, with the drop goal on, Parra kicks a high box kick that absolutely no-one was expecting - least of all the French. England take the 22 with relief. 56 min: Foden collects a high ball under pressure on his 22 line. He offloads to Care, he skips past a couple of tackles, before passing to Flood, who does the same. Eventually, England win a penalty, which Flood kicks long into touch on the French 22. England absorbed the pressure well, then, but have to make this chance pay ... which they don't. The French kick long into the England 22, forcing Foden to kick back. 57 min: Marty breaks through the English line but, when in need of support, he turned to see Poitrenaud streaking past him, rather than being just off his shoulder. A let-off for England as the full back could have been though - though admittedly he was on the halfway line. A knock-on then gives England possession. Jonny Wilkinson is warming up. 58 min: The scrum is untidy again and Nick Easter is forced to break from the back with the ball. Ludicrously, he kicks. Even more ludicrously, it's a good kick that finds touch halfway in the French half. Bewildering. I am still baffled by the decision to take of Mike Tindall, incidentally. Utterly nonsensical. 60 min: Chabal comes on to replace Pierre for France. He instantly drives a ruck forward as France advance, grindingly, up the pitch. But England turn it over. Care chips to the 22 and Ashton fly-kicks over Poitrenaud's head. But he gets too much onto it and France can touch down for a 22. Mike Tindall has just told the BBC's touchline reporter that he didn't want to come off. 61 min: England get the ball down over the tryline. That was a great break from Cueto who charged up into the French 22. He didn't have the support though, and when Care finally reached him, he knocked on. The ball is then touched down over the line, but France are given the scrum. Wilkinson is on for Flutey. Flood has moved to centre, while Wilkinson steps into the fly-half role. 63 min: France kick long to Cueto and he kicks back to Poitrenaud. From the ruck, Parra chips but he chips badly and gives the ball to England, who run it. Finally Wilkinson is adjudged to have knocked the ball on and France get the scrum just outside their 22. 65 min: France kick, and Cueto catches on the halfway line. A bit of toing and froing ensues, before England get a lineout in the French half. They run it, flinging it across the backs. But France win it from the breakdown and they hoof it downfield. This is a very defensive France in this half. Haskell is on, as is Cole who is a blood sub for Payne. 66 min: England win a penalty on the touchline, just outside the French 10 metre line. It'll take a mighty old kick to get it over from here. Wilkinson is lining it up though. PENALTY France 12-10 England: That was a sensational kick from Wilkinson. It slid just inside the post but it had more than enough legs. England are still more than in this. 70 min: England capitalise on a French mistake and run at their opposition. Tait is nearly through, too, but can't quite break free. So play is brought back for an England scrum, as the ref had been playing advantage. From the scrum, England advance to the French 22 but lose the ball - until France kick. It gets booted about a bit, before Foden takes a quick throw in. The ref, who was miles away, says the ball wasn't thrown in straight and it is a fantastically wrong decision. Very poor. 71 min: Ah, actually, it wasn't wrong. The ball was thrown forwards from the quick throw in. So sue me*. * Please don't sue me. 72 min: There are a series of scrums on the English 22. They really don't want to give away another penalty here. Here's Ian Copestake again: \"Wilkinson seems to have the sign over the French as they admire him. Brian Moore must be literally about to burst at the propspect of England grabbing this.\" 72 min: England don't give the penalty away, but France win the scrum very cleanly. They go sideways for a bit before piling into a maul on the 22. When the ball comes out, Poitrenaud runs it, then gives it away to England. Care kicks long and back to Poitrenaud. He kicks, too, and England knock the ball on. French scrum just past England's 10 metre line. Andreu is off, Malzieu is on. 74 min: The French scrum drives up the pitch but when it wheels round, Lewis Moody nails the No8. Some forward stew follows. Finally, France knock the ball on and England eventually get a chance to do something with it. France are essentially just eating up time, now, which is a risky game with only a two-point difference. 76 min: Wilkinson kicks high to the halfway line. Malzieu claims and is instantly tackled by Ashton. Then Tom Palmer puts in an enforcer on the unfortunate Frenchman who emerges with the ball. The French then make their intentions clear - they're going to keep the ball in the forwards and mop up time. 77 min: Wilkinson attempts a sniping, chipped kick over the French line for Tait, Cueto et al to run onto. But the French pluck it up and send it into another time-consuming ruck. When it comes out, Trinh-Duc runs it. Foolishly, England give away a penalty just inside the French half. They can't kick for goal from there, but they do welly it into touch with only two minutes left on the clock. 78 min: Again, France keep it with the forwards. The ball pops out unexpectedly, though, and somehow the referee decides that England have fouled. I have no idea why. That seems inexplicable. 79 min: From the scrum, Malzieu runs but gives away a penalty with 30 seconds left. England are just outside their 22. They kick for a lineout but it's not deep enough. Lineout on the halfway line with the clock ticking over 80 minutes. Peep, peep: Ah, that's it. Foden makes an error, France claim the ball, then knock it into touch. France take the Grand Slam, England take the plaudits for the second half, but the string of errors they made in the first half handed the game to France. I'm off: Thanks for all your emails. That was not particularly impressive from the French. In all honesty, they were totally bossed in the second half by England. The referee didn't much help matters, either. He didn't seem overly disposed towards the England scrum and made some entirely ludicrous decisions. However much England were more minded to run the ball, though, they let themselves down in the first half with some basic errors that gave France kickable penalties. Perhaps the rain can be blamed for some of those mistakes, but, then again, it did rain on both sides. Anyway, well done France. A Grand Slam is a Grand Slam, and it's something of which to be extremely proud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
