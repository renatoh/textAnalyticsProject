Now, in order to keep up with the Joneses, you have to fly by private jet. So it was that, although the Football Association laid on two Boeing 737s to ferry England's players to Luton and Manchester after Wednesday night's friendly in Portugal, five returned by private flight. Although the FA flight was scheduled to land at Manchester at 4am yesterday - with players passing through VIP customs on the Tarmac before being driven home by private cars - Manchester United deemed it essential to make alternative arrangements for Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville. That trio were flown back on a privately hired plane that landed around 30 minutes ahead of the FA flight. The reasoning behind what seems a needless extravagance was the need to offer them maximum recovery time ahead of United's lunchtime kick-off at home to Leeds tomorrow. Meanwhile Newcastle United cited the home derby with Middlesbrough as explanation for spending around \u00a318,000 on hiring the plane that carried Kieron Dyer, Jermaine Jenas and Portugal's Hugo Viana back to Tyneside along with Sir Bobby Robson, Newcastle's manager, and Freddy Shepherd, the chairman. With Robson believing that overnight flights wreak havoc with body clocks, Newcastle's plane did not leave Faro airport until yesterday morning by which time David Beckham and Portugal's Luis Figo had been back in Madrid for several hours having been flown home privately by Real. With Newcastle understood to owe \u00a360m and Robson's entire squad being given a day off yesterday, their flight from Faro seemed an indulgence. But a club spokeswoman insisted: \"It's plain common sense; we've got a derby with Middlesbrough on Saturday afternoon.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
