And last year a flux of newly engaged celebrities flaunted some of the biggest diamonds ever seen on a finger, from Angelina Jolie's \u00a3500,000 ring to Keira Knightley's at \u00a340,000. All very well for the rich, but now even the average Mr who wants his Miss to be a Mrs is catching on to the fad for a gesture when they pop the question, creating a new industry out of planning the proposal. Websites and agencies that have become prolific in the US are springing up here . Welcome to the latest trend \u2013 don't start worrying about the wedding yet, it's all about the proposal. \"It's gone utterly crazy,\" said Daisy Amodio, director of the Proposers, a UK firm which started out last year to help people plan their romantic gesture. \"Men are getting competitive, they want their mates to be impressed as well as the girl. They are trying to outdo each other. A lot of it is people looking for an idea, they'll pay for one that suits them and go away happy to carry it out. At the other end we organise the whole thing, plan it, research and find a venue. \"We launched in May and have been overrun by demand. A lot of it is following celebrity trends, and the movies of course. In days gone by you might have gone for a walk in the park to propose, but that's not enough now. \"About half of our clients come to us with their own idea, which is great because it does need to be personal, but for some of the proposals a guy couldn't do it on his own. \"Like the one who wanted to be a knight in shining armour, we had to find him a castle and decorate it and persuade him out of wearing the complete helmet. We've done singers and horse-drawn carriages in Horse Guards Parade. My partner has been in New York arranging one there, it's all very romantic and everyone cries. They are all normal people who use us, who just want to make it special and something to be remembered. I'm really proud of them all and we haven't had one who has lost their nerve or one that has said no.\" Amodio is working on her first flashmob proposal, something she thinks will become more popular. \"We're getting loads of women, gay people now too, quite a lot of gay women especially.\" The pressure is on to come up with something spectacular. The words can be written on Casino playing cards (Robbie Williams) or in flaming torches on the beach (property developer Nick Candy). Think location, think buildup, think romance, think a whole lot of rose petals. Overblown shows of sentiment are never going to be everyone's cup of tea, however. They are not, for example, for Dame Helen Mirren, who this weekend declared that she and her partner, Taylor Hackford, are not \"remotely romantic\". The actor added: \"I'd be completely horrified if Taylor gave me a Valentine's Day card.\" And Amodio does recommend that people think carefully about making a public proposal: \"It's not to everyone's liking\", as a baseball fan found out last year when he proposed in front of 10,000 people in a US stadium, along with a viewer who asked US TV show host Ellen DeGeneres to propose on his behalf on national television \u2013 they both scored a \"no thanks\". For the sceptics among you thinking that a romantic gesture does not a long and happy married life make, remember the late Johnny Cash, who proposed to June Carter live on stage in Canada and got a \"yes\" \u2013 and 35 years of marriage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
