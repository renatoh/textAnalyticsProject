Iain Hume got the goals for Leicester although they also finished a man down as Alan Maybury was carried off as Southend were equalising. Freddy Eastwood got Southend's first goal and Richie Foran was sent off for a second yelllow card 14 minutes from time. Coventry City made it seven points from nine under Iain Dowie by seeing off Hull City 2-0, Mickael Doyle from the spot and Leon Mckenzie getting their goals. \"Doyle said if there was going to be a penalty he wanted to take it and at that I raised an eyebrow,\" Dowie said. \"But it was a well-taken kick.\" It left Hull fourth bottom and clear of the relegation places only on goal difference. \"The difference between the sides was Dele Adebola, backing in and winning headers,\" said Hull's manager Phil Brown. Norwich City won 3-1 at sixth-bottom Barnsley, three points above the relegation places, Darren Huckerby, Lee Croft and Chris Martin getting the City goals although Istvan Ferenczi pulled one back, all of them before half-time. Sylvan Ebanks-Blake gave the FA Cup quarter-finalists Plymouth Argyle the lead from the spot against Stoke City but the visitors equalised through Darel Russell. \"We will not be giving up on the play-offs yet,\" said Tony Pulis, the Stoke manager who was given a muted reception on his first return to Home Park since walking out last summer. Ade Akinbiyi's first league goal since returning to Burnley negated Clinton Morrison's 15th-minute opener for Crystal Palace. \"We are getting better but the trouble is everyone wants to get better overnight,\" said the Burnley manager Steve Cotterill, winless in 16 games. Scunthorpe United moved 10 points clear in League One after a 2-0 win at Brentford. Nottingham Forest took advantage of a slip by Yeovil Town - 4-2 losers at Port Vale -to move into second with a 5-1 win over Huddersfield Town. Bristol City are third after a 1-0 win over Northampton Town Hartlepool United moved five points clear of League Two with a 3-2 win over Hereford United as Walsall were held to a goalless draw at Darlington. Stockport County broke a 119-year Football League record with their 3-0 win over Swindon Town, their ninth match in succession without conceding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
