Wolf, who earned himself the label The Man Without a Face for his ability to elude being photographed, died in his sleep in his Berlin apartment early today. He was 83. During his 34 years as a spy, Wolf pulled off some of the cold war\u2019s best known plots, not least planting his agent, G\u00fcnter Guillaume, as a top aide to west Germany\u2019s chancellor, Willy Brandt. The unmasking of his agent triggered Mr Brandt\u2019s resignation in 1974. Wolf rapidly climbed the ranks of the GDR\u2019s secret police, the Stasi, to head its elite foreign intelligence division. He was internationally famed for leading a troop of well-placed agents who, among other coups, managed to tap into Nato secrets. \u201cHe will go down in history for being one of the most successful espionage chiefs of the cold war,\u201d said Jochen Staadt, a professor at the Otto-Suhr-Insitut, in Berlin, who specialises in the history of the Stasi. \u201cBut the negative side of his work won\u2019t be forgotten either - for instance, his department for disinformation about west Germany, which manufactured gossip and lies to defame western politicians.\u201d Wolf was also notorious for his strategy of using seductive \u201cRomeo\u201d agents to lure government secretaries in the west. In his memoirs he predicted that his tactic of using sex in spying would go down in espionage history. Rumours have swirled that John le Carr\u00e9 took Wolf as the inspiration for the character of Karla, the shadowy Soviet spymaster of his cold-war sagas - though the bestselling author strongly denied it. \u201cThe only Wolf I was familiar with, when I wrote the books in which he apparently claimed to have appeared, was a lawnmower. I repeatedly refused to appear on public platforms with him, and I have no admiration for his achievements.\u201d When Germany was reunified in 1990 Wolf fled to Moscow. He eventually surrendered to his former foes at a rural border crossing in Bavaria. In 1993 he was charged with treason and given a six-year sentence, which was later suspended on grounds that his activities had been legal in communist east Germany. But Wolf stood by his work for the GDR. It would have been \u201cvictors\u2019 justice\u201d to have punished him for the same practices used by his western enemies, he argued during a four-year appeal. In recent years he shunned the limelight - behaviour befitting a man who avoided revealing his face to western agencies until 1978 and then ceded his first interview more than a decade later. After the collapse of communism he wrote books, including his memoirs and a book on Russian cookery - a taste acquired during work-related trips to Russia during the cold war. He will go down in history as a key player in the Stasi, a notoriously thorough organisation that infiltrated almost every aspect of daily life. Just before the communist regime collapsed, as many as one in 50 east Germans collaborated with the secret police service, divulging information about neighbours, close friends and even spouses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
