Residents of the small city of Akiak were alarmed to find the Kuskokwim River suddenly much closer to housing after about 75-100ft of riverbank disappeared over the course of just a few hours. The erosion, which occurred late last month, stripped away the riverbank for the entire length of Akiak, which has a population of around 340. \u201cWe got about three houses in imminent danger, and the rest of them will be coming along pretty quickly,\u201d said David Gilila, Akiak\u2019s city administrator. Gilila said he was appealing for funding to relocate some homes, warning that the water could soon surround the city. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be here, but we\u2019ll probably become an island,\u201d he said. The drastic reshaping of Akiak is probably down to thawing permafrost, the frozen organic matter held within soils. Alaska is heating up twice as quickly as the rest of the US as a result of human-driven climate breakdown, increasingly causing this permafrost to thaw and destabilize buildings and cause roads to buckle. \u201cThe changes are really accelerating in Alaska,\u201d said Susan Natali, a scientist and Arctic expert at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely this riverbank in Akiak was lost because of thawing permafrost, given where it\u2019s situated and the warm winter and spring they\u2019ve had. It\u2019s not a problem that\u2019s going to go away.\u201d Alaska has just experienced its warmest spring on record, breaking a record only set in 2016. Since the 1970s, springtime in the state has heated up by around 2.2C (4F), double the global temperature rise of the past century. The breakneck speed of Alaska\u2019s rising heat is having cascading consequences, with vanishing sea ice exposing coastal communities to storms, altered wildlife and plant patterns that make it harder for people to find food. There is also a growing wildfire threat putting communities at risk. Unless it causes buildings to topple, permafrost thawing is often a more obscure feature of this warming, although it could prove to be among the most significant. As the frozen ground across the Arctic melts, it releases a huge amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Scientists recently found this process could trigger a dangerous acceleration of global heating that would cause tens of trillions of dollars in climate-related damage. A separate study found that parts of the Canadian Arctic are experiencing a rate of permafrost thaw six times the long-term average. In Alaska, there are dozens of towns that the federal government has identified as being in potential need of relocation due to the damage caused by the climate crisis. The village of Newtok in western Alaska was granted $15m last year to start shifting homes to safer ground but the vast majority of communities have no pathway to do likewise. \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge because in the US there isn\u2019t the precedence to deal with this and there isn\u2019t the political framework to deal with it either,\u201d said Natali. \u201cThe numbers needing relocation will grow, the costs are going up and people\u2019s lives and cultural practices will be impacted. \u201cEvery year there\u2019s a new temperature record, it\u2019s getting worse and worse and you feel like a broken record saying it. This should be the number one urgent conversation happening right now because it\u2019s not just going to be Alaska, it\u2019s going to be other communities all over the US,\u201d Natali added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
