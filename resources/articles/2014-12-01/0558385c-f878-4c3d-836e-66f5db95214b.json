Long Weekend is a hybrid 1978 horror, thriller and relationship drama by director Colin Eggleston and is one of the stand-outs of the genre \u2013 but it comes with a big twist. There is no single beast the characters must combat in the manner of a man v animal showdown such as Razorback or Jaws. Nor is the source of their terror a single species that turns against them, such as Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds. The Long Weekend follows a married couple who treat the environment and creatures around them with callous disrespect. Marcia (Briony Behets), for example, can\u2019t be bothered organising anybody to take care of the family dog during their eponymous vacation. Peter (John Hargreaves) tosses a cigarette out of his window (which starts a fire), runs over a kangaroo and has several showdowns with a dugong. The film was written by Everett De Roche, who also created Road Games and Patrick, and is built on a tantalising premise: what if nature decided enough was enough and fought back? What if the birds, the insects, the wind, water and breeds of animals big and small combined forces to exact revenge on humans for smiting them, or taking them for granted? Shortly after Eggleston\u2019s environmental-psychological-dramatic-broken-marriage-thriller (to coin a genre) begins, we hear a television report in the background. Residents in western Sydney have reported flocks of white cockatoos attacking their homes, the reporter says, an occurrence for which the Department of Agriculture has no reasonable explanation. Given the nightmarish tale in store \u2013 a sort of National Geographic or David Attenborough special gone heinously wrong \u2013 this is important information, but its relevance is downplayed. An inattentive Marcia turns off the TV mid-report. The story proper begins, framed on a human level as a drama between two people on the brink of divorce. Marcia and Peter go camping at the beach to see if they can salvage their marriage. They bicker and fight for much of it, with threats such as \u201cI\u2019m filing for divorce on Monday\u201d (Marcia) met with retaliations such as \u201cLong weekend, sugar. You\u2019ll have to miss tennis and do it on Tuesday\u201d (Peter). As their exchanges grow increasingly vitriolic the forces around them become more calculated and forthright. Birds swoop, dogs snarl, snakes circle and the walls \u2013 for want of a better word, since the film is based outdoors \u2013 slowly close in. Long Weekend\u2019s villain is mother nature, who toys with her prey as playfully and maniacally as a villain in a slasher movie. In the way elements combine to work against the characters, the film is like a proto Final Destination, but far more diligently configured and with a mounting psychological intensity that eventually hits fever pitch. If Long Weekend can be read through a contemporary lens as a roundabout commentary on the need for action on climate change (that we must protect the environment because, unlike in this film, it cannot protect itself) Eggleston wholly succeeds in forcing audiences to look at interactions with nature from a different perspective. Acts as simple as spraying insecticide or an axe connecting with a tree feel eerily significant. The score and sound design come in and out of focus in waves, subtle to cataclysmic, from bursts of highly strung violins to sparse keyboards and synthesisers. Cries of a dugong can often be heard in the background. In the height of a chaotic moment the noise and clatter is often pared right back to simple recurring effects, which proves even more unsettling: the crackle of a fire; wind rustling through leaves; a branch slowly falling from a tree. The tension and tumult build to a psychological conclusion in which menace radiates from virtually everything around the characters. In Long Weekend the villain has an omnipotent ubiquity, present in tiny bugs to beasts in the water and birds in the sky. When one of the terrified characters hopelessly waves a gun around, they have everything \u2013 and nothing \u2013 to point at. It is a breathless conclusion to a masterpiece in minimalist horror."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
