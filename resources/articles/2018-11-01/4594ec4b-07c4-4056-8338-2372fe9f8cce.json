Mueller is investigating Russian tampering in the 2016 election, alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives and related matters. Trump\u2019s lawyers and Mueller have been in negotiations for months over whether Trump would be interviewed by the special counsel in person, submit written responses to Mueller\u2019s questions or neither. Mueller agreed to accept Trump\u2019s answers in writing \u2013 although the prosecutor could still seek Trump\u2019s testimony in person \u2013 after almost a year of negotiations with Trump\u2019s attorneys. Mueller sent the White House questions in mid-October. The questions number \u201croughly two dozen\u201d and focus on five topics, all relating \u201cto issues before Trump won the 2016 presidential election\u201d, the Washington Post reported. That would mean the questions would not touch on the firing of FBI director James Comey or Trump\u2019s changing explanations for a June 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump tower. On Friday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he had answered Mueller\u2019s questions \u201cvery easily\u201d. \u201cMy lawyers aren\u2019t working on it. I\u2019m working on it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy lawyers don\u2019t write the answers.\u201d Trump\u2019s answers are not expected to become public any time soon. Mueller could use the answers as evidence in his investigation of Trump campaign figures. Last August, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he had discouraged Trump from testifying out of concern for a \u201cperjury trap\u201d Mueller might set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
