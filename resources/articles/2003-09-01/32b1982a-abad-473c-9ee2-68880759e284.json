Remarkable things are happening in a county that, let's face it, has never had much of a reputation for churning out great sporting talent, but which is currently producing potential world-beaters like there is no tomorrow. Fourteen-year-old Emily Pidgeon started breaking records at 12, when she set the European best for her age at 3,000m, and hasn't stopped since. This summer, Pidgeon became the youngest woman ever to represent Britain in an international distance track race and broke national record after national record along the way. Not far behind was her team-mate Sarah Hopkinson, the fastest ever 11-year-old in Europe at 800m and 1500m. Both are running significantly quicker than Paula Radcliffe, Kelly Holmes and pretty much anyone else who progressed to greater things did at the same age. As if to prove there really is something in the west country water, their training partner 11-year-old Ben Coldray became British record holder at the mile this year. Not that Gloucestershire has total monopoly of the athletic gene pool. Britain's current glut of sporting prodigies stretches the length of the country, from the teenage tennis sensations Jade Curtis in Cornwall and Hannah Grady in Warwickshire to Scotland, where Liz McColgan's 12-year-old daughter Eilish, who recently beat girls seven years her senior to finish third in the BUPA Junior Great North Run, appears to be following in her mother's footsteps. Ah, you might think, but where will they be when it matters? Will Pidgeon and the other fledglings still be flying across the line in first place when Britain needs a win to haul itself off the bottom of the 2012 Olympic medal table? Well, thanks to a new programme aimed at nurturing such precocious sporting talent through the bumpy ride from puberty to adulthood, there is a greater chance than ever that they will indeed make it. Developed and funded by the Departments for Skills and Education and for Culture, Media and Sport, the Junior Athlete Education (JEA) initiative is part of the government's national talent framework. Over the next three years, the Youth Sport Trust will be rolling out the JEA programme on a national basis through its coordinator Chris Earle. Among other things, it hopes to provide a comprehensive education strategy to prepare parents, coaches and the young athletes themselves for the pitfalls and pressures they face. The idea is that once athletic talent has been identified by national governing bodies or schools, the children and their families will be introduced to the services and workshops of the JEA. It is likely to act as a safety net to prevent at least some of our best young hopefuls drifting away from sport. Teenage champions have never had it easy, but if anything the odds against them continuing to compete are greater than ever. Along with the physical changes and psychological challenges of adolescence, they now have to cope with the mountain of school exams that makes them the most tested generation of pupils in Europe. Some are limited by a lack of financial support; others struggle against parents who try to live out their own dreams vicariously through their children's achievements. Now shoe manufacturers have latched on to the notion that the younger the sports star, the higher their market value. Nike signed a \u00a355m contract with the 17-year-old basketball player LeBron James and another deal with the 13-year-old footballer Freddy Adu. But even they are knocking on a bit compared with Reebok's signing of the basketball prodigy Mark Walker Jr, who is 3. Lumped together, these pressures might normally prove too great a burden for young shoulders to bear. Which is where the JEA can make a difference. It can't supply the psyche required to become a champion, but it can provide support through difficult times. If only one of the latest crop of sensational youngsters makes it as a result, it will be a system worth its weight in gold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
