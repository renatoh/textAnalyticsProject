The ageing process has some unpleasant side-effects, not least the inability to restrict the growth of hair to its familiar haunts, but the worst has to be when you find yourself turning into your parents and greeting the appearance of Rory McIlroy during his immaculate first round at the Open last week with the cry: \"Poor lad, his barber must be dead.\" As what used to be known as \"scruffy articles\" go, the Northern Irishman is not unique in enjoying a good summer. Unique in thinking Art Garfunkel hair plus sponsor's cap does not equal twin protuberances sticking out of the side that resemble Springer Spaniel's ears perhaps, but the other main disciple of the Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall look, Spain's Carles Puyol, had an even more glittering July. There remains something charmingly authentic about sportsmen who do not conform to the well-spruced norm and are throwbacks to a rich and bedraggled tradition. The contrast between Germany's Joachim L\u00f6w, who looked as if he had stepped out of an Astrid Kirchherr photograph of young existentialists watching the Beatles at the Kaiserkeller in 1960, and the infinitely more crumpled Vicente del Bosque, reminded me of the days when almost all football managers mirrored the Spaniard. Take the 1973 FA Cup final, for instance. Don Revie led out Leeds United in his \"lucky blue suit\", a garment more fabled in west Yorkshire than the golden fleece. But because it was one of his superstitions to wear it at every match, it was, according to Peter Lorimer, threadbare and full of holes. Sunderland's manager, Bob Stokoe, however, was shabbier still. He teamed his tracksuit and boots with a snuff-coloured gabardine and trilby and was hoisted on to his players' shoulders after victory as the very picture of a man who had popped down to the shop for a pint of milk and a paper without bothering to change out of his pyjamas before breakfast. Footballers caring about their appearance is a relatively new trend and I think the man to blame here is the former QPR goalkeeper Phil Parkes, who tamed his blow-dry with Cossack hairspray in a series of adverts in the late 1970s. It did not catch on immediately, and some of the best maverick talents of the day had little truck with personal grooming. Chief among them was Nottingham Forest's John Robertson, who was rescued from the reserves by Brian Clough's assistant, Peter Taylor. \"Fat, loafing and with the dress sense of a tramp,\" was Taylor's opinion of the winger. But he also considered him a \"buried treasure\". A number of other Forest players, particularly Kenny Burns and Archie Gemmill, could have given Robertson a run in the Catweazle stakes but Clough during Forest's golden age was less strident about the way his players looked than he later became. Chris Waddle also had the knack of looking dishevelled in whatever he wore, as did Everton's Neville Southall and Coventry's Brian Kilcline. The Sky Blues captain had a fearsome demeanour and looked as if he subsisted on a diet entirely made up of meat. The sight of him in a suit on FA Cup final day in 1987 was as incongruous as John McEnroe in a dinner jacket at the Wimbledon Ball six years earlier. And the England No8 Dean Richards, his shirt tails flapping on the field, could always make his post-match blazer look like a sack. Conventional attire was not designed for such wild and free spirits. Cricketers in white flannels usually seem smart but those idiosyncratic wicketkeepers Alan Knott and Jack Russell, who favoured comfort above everything and replaced their buttons with sticking plasters, always managed to look like dogs' dinners. Russell, especially, because he insisted on wearing his beloved and much-repaired sun hat. Michael Atherton, too, always had the air of the recalcitrant schoolboy who was rebelling against his mother's attempts to smear down his disobedient fringe with a hankie and a dab of spit. That they could not care less about how they looked never diluted our affection for them. In fact it added to it, as it seemed to imply they were serious and unconcerned by such fripperies. And, despite wanting to call the hair police to attend to McIlroy, there is something wonderful about a golfer who does not give a toss about the snickering. John Daly and Ian Poulter with their ridiculous trousers appear to deploy them as a contrivance to keep their profiles high. McIlroy just does his own thing. He may be a bit of a scruffbag, but he joins a long list of magnificent ones who graced the greatest games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
