A staff notice appended to a rota for the Christmas period told workers that \u201ccalling in sick during the next two weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken\u201d, according to a copy sent to the Unite trade union. Unite said one of its members had sent it the document, and while \u201cit may be a shocking example \u2026 it\u2019s sadly quite normal across the industry \u2013 particularly at this time of year\u201d. A Wagamama spokesperson confirmed that the report was accurate but said that it was an isolated incident. \u201cThe manager involved feared team member shortages over the festive period and regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach,\u201d the spokesperson said. The statement continued: \u201cWe sincerely apologise for what has happened and wish all our team members and customers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\u201d The note read: \u201cNo calling in sick! May I remind you that if you are unable to come for your shift it is your responsibility to find somebody to cover your shift (as per contract and handbook). Calling in sick during the next two weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken.\u201d The Labour MP Frank Field was critical of the threat of disciplinary action, saying: \u201cEven a brief glimpse of such Scrooge-like behaviour is enough to make anyone feel sick, let alone actually having to work for a company behaving this way. I\u2019m sure Wagamama\u2019s customers would feel sick too, knowing that staff are on the receiving of this rotten behaviour over Christmas.\u201d In a Facebook post, Unite\u2019s hospitality division said: \u201cThis is why we need to come together in a union to stop such exploitation. Fair Hospitality [a Unite campaign] was created for that very purpose. Get involved and let\u2019s transform the sector, together.\u201d Before the chain apologised, circulation of the note sparked a #boycottwagamama campaign on social media as people expressed anger at the threat to workers and voiced concern that the approach could put customers\u2019 health at risk by forcing unwell kitchen and restaurant workers to undertake shifts when they are carrying contagious illnesses. Wagamama employs 4,800 people and has 166 branches in the UK, most of which are operated directly but some of which have franchise agreements. Last year, the company made a \u00a334m profit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
