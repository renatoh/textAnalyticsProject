Rosa was first held at the Utah County jail in 2013 after he pleaded guilty to a felony criminal offense of illegal re-entry, and was transferred to ICE, which has a contract to hold immigrants there. In late 2014, he says guards put him in a cell with an overflowing toilet and refused to let him shower, which led to an infection of his scrotum that went untreated and caused his rectum to swell shut and then an intestinal infection. Close to death, his family says, Rosa was taken to a hospital for emergency surgery, then sent home to recover with the help of in-home nurse visits that they paid for. He was nearly castrated, and left sterile. Before Rosa got sick, ICE said he would \u201cnot be released from custody\u201d as he appealed against his deportation before the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) \u201cbased on a review of your file record and/or personal interview and consideration of any information you submitted to ICE reviewing officials\u201d. But, after his infection, a new option emerged. ICE allowed him to be \u201cat large\u201d under the condition that he appear \u201cat the time and place specified, upon each and every request of the Service, for identification and for deportation and removal\u201d. His daughter insists she took him to every check-in requested by ICE during his supervised release. Rosa was told he faced deportation on 19 September 2015, and that he needed to show his voluntary deportation would take place, by producing a flight itinerary. Instead, he appealed for a grant of humanitarian relief. In late November, the BIA ruled he was ineligible since he had been ordered deported, and suggested that \u201c[w]hile we are sympathetic to applicant\u2019s situation, a request for favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion must be directed to ICE\u201d. The Connecticut-based Thomas Rome Law Group, which is helping Rosa\u2019s family, wrote to ICE, but received a swift rejection the next day. On 5 January they appealed to the BIA once more by noting that a ruling in another case suggested \u201cthe favorable exercise of discretion is warranted for humanitarian reasons [emphasis in the original] even if there is little likelihood of future persecution\u201d. They argued that Rosa \u201cis exactly such a case\u201d. Among the evidence they presented was a letter from Rosa\u2019s doctor saying \u201che has had several recurrences of the infection\u201d and was not fit to travel. But just over a week later, Rosa was arrested at gunpoint in his living room by federal agents who had a warrant for \u201cAlleged Violation of Supervised Release\u201d. The unexpected charge accused him of failing to check in \u2013 not with ICE, but with a federal probation officer, based on his felony conviction of illegal re-entry. On Wednesday, a public defender argued in federal court that Rosa had been under the impression he was complying with the terms of his release and that an electronic monitoring device on his ankle had kept authorities abreast of his whereabouts. The judge sentenced him to \u201ctime served\u201d \u2013 a response his legal adviser described as a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d. Rosa\u2019s wife, also called Lorena, was able to visit him at the Cache County jail near their home after the hearing, and had hoped he would be released after 48 hours if ICE officials did not take him back into custody. Instead, ICE chose to transfer Rosa to the Utah County jail \u2013 where he says he became deathly ill just over a year ago. \u201cThey are just trying to wash their hands of him,\u201d said Rosa\u2019s son, Raul, who told the Guardian his father called him on Thursday to say ICE wanted his passport in order to prepare his deportation. \u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t sign anything. Let me get ahold of a lawyer.\u2019\u201d He insists his father was healthy before he was held in ICE custody, and that the agency wants to avoid being sued for medical neglect. Rosa\u2019s family says it is searching for a lawyer to help them with a medical neglect lawsuit. The Guardian obtained Rosa\u2019s signature on a privacy waiver that gives ICE permission to confirm any details about his medical treatment at the jail in 2014. The agency says it is working on a response, but has not yet provided one. It did confirm that Rosa is back in their custody at the same jail but did not provide a statement by the time this article was published. Meanwhile, Mark Reid, a senior paralegal with the Thomas Rome Law Group assisting the Rosa family from his office in Connecticut, insisted \u201cthere is no reason for ICE to hold him for deportation\u201d as the BIA could take months to review his latest appeal. During that time, Reid says, Rosa should be allowed to return to conditions of supervised release and regular check-ins, just as he had been doing before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
