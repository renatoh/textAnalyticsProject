If the Jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel. There are already over 1 million Israeli refugees displaced from their homes, with hundreds of thousands living in bomb shelters, because of Hizbullah missiles. Terrorist groups like Hizbullah are known to use women and children as human shields. During the past six years they have built their underground bunkers and tunnels, upon which they have built residential multi-unit dwellings. This is not a battle between Islam and the west, it is a battle between radical Islam and democracy. Al-Qaida's entry into this melee, with its pledged support for Hizbullah and a worldwide campaign to hit Jewish targets, only fortifies this inference. A dismantling of the Iranian proxy, Hizbullah, would be a major blow against global terrorism, rogue states Syria and Iran, and possibly even Iran's nuclear plans. But if Hizbullah emerges intact as a fighting force, Israel and the global war on terrorism would suffer significantly. Much of the Middle East has been engulfed by Islamic radicalism. Israel must remain strong as democracy's bulwark against the tide. A forced ceasefire will be a defeat for Israel and democracy. Harry Grunstein Hampstead, Quebec In the war in Lebanon, language and values have taken on a new Orwellian guise. Israeli military commanders claim that they do not kill individuals, they only kill terrorists. How can more than 900 individuals - ordinary men, women and children - killed in this war be labelled terrorists? When Israel targets families as they leave their villages, after having given them a deadline for evacuation, is it killing terrorists? Life seems to have a different value on each side of the blue line. In order to \"rescue\" two Israeli soldiers, an entire nation of 3 million came under attack and that attack itself perpetuated the response from Hizbullah, which is terrorising northern Israel. Is rendering a third of Lebanon's population homeless and terrorising the whole country a measured response? Is it likely to lead to the rescue of those two forgotten soldiers? Maybe the Egyptians and the Palestinians got the ratio right when they demanded the release of 1,000 Palestinians in exchange for one Israeli soldier held in Gaza. According to the US and Israel, Hizbullah is a terrorist organisation while Israel is \"defending itself\". Does making 900,000 people homeless not constitute terror? Is self-defence reserved only for the strong? Amy Mina Amman, Jordan Despite massive coverage of the crisis in the Middle East, silence around the question of Israel's intentions towards the Palestinian people seems total. There is little room to doubt that the long-term goal of Israel is to confine the population of Palestine within a collection of impoverished cantons at the margins of their historic homeland, sealed off from one another and the outside world except to the extent that Israel sees fit to allow. In such conditions, the Palestinian economy and society risk withering away. This is an existential threat and Palestinians have been stripped of all normal means of protecting themselves. How are they to respond, and what kinds of responses would be legitimate? I have no easy answer to this question, but let us see it discussed - loudly, openly and often. Murray Glickman London Jonathan Freedland (Comment, August 2) denounces Hizbullah for embedding its fighters in Lebanese villages, next to schools, hospitals and refugee centres. But where does he think Israel's weapons factories, army camps and military airfields are to be found? We are located here between a military camp and a weapons factory. Israel recently publicised the fact that Hizbullah had fired \"near a hospital\" in a northern Israeli city. In fact, there is a large army camp right next to that hospital. I am forbidden from identifying the hospital or the city under Israel's military censorship rules. These are rarely mentioned by the media, but have been effective in shutting down discussion of what Hizbullah is actually targeting in northern Israel. Jonathan Cook Nazareth, Israel The Iranian government must be finding it difficult to hide its glee. Not only has its surrogate, Hizbullah, rained rockets on Israel, provoking them into attacking Lebanon, but all of it has diverted attention from Iran's determination to defy the UN and proceed with its nuclear programme. Lest I be accused of being pro-Israeli, I was one of the first in the Lords to call for a ceasefire.
