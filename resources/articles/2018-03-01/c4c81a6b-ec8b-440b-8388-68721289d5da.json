Not writing, but carpentry (nice workshop, by the way; lots of kit. I guess 20m book sales buy you a chisel or two). \u201cA plane is a lovely tool, it really is,\u201d he says, planing away. \u201cBecause you take off little bits, little tiny bits, little shivers, little slivers of wood, until you\u2019ve got the thickness that you want.\u201d Woodwork and writing novels is all the same, really. Just craft. \u201cI enjoy making all sorts of things,\u201d he tells Alan Yentob. \u201cI enjoy making things out of bits of wood, I enjoy the process of constructing a story and making it work better.\u201d Perhaps, in some ways, carpentry is harder because if you go too far, there\u2019s no going back. A plane has no undo-edit key. Pullman isn\u2019t just very good at his craft \u2013 the main one, writing \u2013 he\u2019s also good at talking about it. Such as on the importance of rhythm, for example. \u201cYou have to hear what you\u2019re writing,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause prose isn\u2019t simply a sort of porridge with no structure. It\u2019s got a metrical structure, and if you\u2019re not aware of it, you damn well should be.\u201d Yes! There\u2019s too much porridge being served up. Please, sir, no more. For anyone who tries to do a bit of chiselling themselves, there\u2019s a lot to take note of here. It\u2019s not just a workshop, though. He talks about his own life and the influences that made him the person and the writer he is. Such as his mother reading him Kipling\u2019s Just So Stories, which he loved for their intoxicating rhythm (there it is again). He began to discover the words for himself, and engaged with language. He talks about living abroad: the ships, the sea and the thrill of arriving in a new port. And time spent with his vicar grandfather in Wales, his love of the Bible and the hymns, which became a part of him. He talks about His Dark Materials, and how organised religion and religious power are evil. And about Milton, Blake and the business \u2013 and necessity \u2013 of growing up. And how Chambers Dictionary is the best because it tells you that feisty means farty. And about daemons and Dust. And about how he is a realist, not a fantasist, and that his main interest is the way real people behave and what it means to be human. And about teaching, and having to come to terms with his pilot father\u2019s suicide. And about his own death, which he contemplates more and more. And so on \u2026 I hope he\u2019s right about death; that it\u2019s how it goes in The Amber Spyglass. So when you die, you have to give an account of yourself \u2013 tell the Harpies about your life, about what you saw, knew and did. If it\u2019s true, and resonates with them, then you\u2019re free, to dissolve and become part of the universe again. But then Pullman says: \u201cIt\u2019s no good going there and saying: \u2018Well, I watched the television mainly.\u2019 That won\u2019t get you out of the World of the Dead.\u201d Which for me is a worry, as that is what I will have done. I better do more stuff if I\u2019m ever to get out of the World of the Dead. Yentob has been known to photobomb (or docobomb?) his own Imagine films. There can be too much of him in them. But in this one he keeps a relatively low profile \u2013 sensibly, given all the sense and wisdom coming from the subject. Top punditry, too \u2013 other (top) writers, as you\u2019d expect, and booky people: Pullman\u2019s agent and his publisher, who couldn\u2019t put The Ruby in the Smoke down. But also Maggie Aderin-Pocock, the space scientist, who talks about the place Pullman\u2019s work has in the universe. Peter Hitchens, the Christian zealot and former Marxist, appears to tell us that Pullman\u2019s work is propaganda and an attempt to undermine the basis of Christian faith. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, believes it\u2019s useful for the Christian church to have these questions asked. It\u2019s a fascinating film about a truly amazing craftsman. As in writer. I\u2019m not so sure about the carpentry. Looking at whatever it is he is planing, it looks uneven and gouged out \u2013 a bit shoddy, to be honest. It\u2019s probably just a prop for the film, though, to illustrate the craft comparison. But maybe don\u2019t give up the day job just yet, Philip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
