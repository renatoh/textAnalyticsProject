This may be unfair on Stuart Lancaster, but putting a lid on excess was very much part of his early brief and perhaps he couldn\u2019t stop pressing down. Or maybe all the questions about Sam Burgess \u2013 should he play, where might he play, how would he play? \u2013 were the whispers that made it seem like here was a camp that dared not speak its mind. Rugby, unless you want to lob something politically incorrect the way of your opposite number, is not a game best played sotto voce. It is clear that England like Eddie Jones, and Eddie likes England. From the very start he asked his players to be less buttoned up and play closer to the edge. He has responded to their wholeheartedness by defending them when, inevitably on stages of easily ignited passions, they have strayed beyond the mark. And not just defending them, but counterattacking, too. To make Wales the guilty party in the continuing Joe Marler affair \u2013 Eddie accused them in the week of using it to derail England\u2019s grand slam preparations \u2013 was a remarkably inventive way of making the purveyors of the original insult into the victims of an anti-England conspiracy. Such deviancy by Wales was almost racist, Eddie might have been thinking, and Marler so wounded by the experience, poor dab, that he was best taken out of the fray and stuck on the bench. Without wishing to add fresh undertones to the unseemly din, it is very Antipodean to turn a disadvantage into a cause. As the All Blacks said after Brian O\u2019Driscoll was drilled head first into the turf in 2005: \u201cCircle the wagons, they\u2019ll be out to get us.\u201d Old England always seemed to be saying sorry for past sins; Eddie\u2019s England apologise to no one (other than to Samson Lee at half-time). 2 The captain Dylan Hartley, with a string of convictions to his name and with Jamie George\u2019s form putting him under even greater strain at hooker, has been inspirational as captain. Taken off on a stretcher against France, he has played well and spoken well; has taken no nonsense and yet has been entertaining and frank. Chris Robshaw has played like a No6 relieved to be in his rightful position and glad to have shed a burden. The retention of the old captain, happily reduced to the ranks in his new team, revealed a compassionate side to Jones. The players must have heard all the tales of the coach\u2019s ruthlessness but he has embraced them and turned two careers around. He even found time to praise the work of Lancaster, his predecessor. Of such management are loyalties made. 3 The second-rows Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes have not exactly gone away but the rise of George Kruis and the appearance of Maro Itoje have been so startlingly impressive that it will take strong arms to prise the second-row shirts away from the Saracens duo. England have never been short of locks but this looks a rare pairing \u2013 powerful as one and yet individually prominent at the same time. Kruis has been commanding on the England throw and has run low to the ground and made solid contact at ruck and maul. Itoje has stolen ball and has run with real speed and guile. England have brawn and brains where they matter. 4 The back three Not many would accuse Mike Brown of putting thought before instinct, but the full-back has been as engaged and as effective as ever. His aggression no longer stands out \u2013 Owen Farrell and Marler have helped share the role of pantomime villain \u2013 and he seems to have put all his anger into catching and running. His understanding with Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell is a work in progress but they are beginning to understand each other\u2019s whereabouts and their intentions. Add this back-three threat to the efforts of the pack and England will be able to attack on many fronts, sparkle and grunt in harmony. 5 Billy Vunipola He is more than a one-man attack and credit must go to Haskell and Robshaw at his sides \u2013 the back-row must be as complementary to one another as they are duty-bound to their specific and very different duties. But Billy V has been sensational, the quiet No8 who plays noisily, the humble servant who runs the England game. He\u2019s larger than life and difficult to miss, but the more he has been the object of defensive planning, the more he has found space and bounced tacklers out of the way. 6 Defence The coach Paul Gustard has injected pace into the line speed of the tacklers. Wales looked devoid of skill in the first half at Twickenham but that was because they were confronted by a defence that was in their faces and around their knees before they had a firm grasp of the ball. We keep waiting for that point beyond which defences can get no more watertight, but it appears we are not there yet. Players are approaching the tackle faster as runners and faster as ball-carriers. The question is whether the laws need to be changed to avoid serious damage at this point of contact \u2013 or whether good technique will suffice. The odds favour (wrong word) injury at the moment as concern for personal safety remains invisible. For their own good, players will need to be slowed down, but for the moment England lead the charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
