A backlash against the former television presenter persuaded him to stick with his lot as a Ukip MEP for the East Midlands. Mr Kilroy-Silk attempted to put a positive gloss on his decision, saying he would have had to resign as an MEP if he had won the forthcoming byelection. No date has been set for the byelection which has been caused by the appointment of Peter Mandelson as Britain's next European commissioner. \"Having only just been elected I thought that was a totally inappropriate thing to do,\" Mr Kilroy-Silk told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Mr Kilroy-Silk denied that he had been the victim of an internal feud. This was sparked by his comment, in a GMTV interview with Joan Bakewell on the eve of the European elections, that he might consider standing for the leadership of Ukip. Many saw this as an insensitive attempt to upstage Roger Knapman, the former Tory whip, who is Ukip leader. \"There is no fierce infighting,\" Mr Kilroy-Silk told Today. \"Roger Knapman I like and I get on with and we have a very straightforward, honest relationship. I have no ambitions, I have no intentions. I have no desire to be the leader of Ukip. \"I do not know one single person in the party who did not want me to stand and I wanted to stand. I thought that I could represent my East Midlands constituents effectively as well as the people of Hartlepool.\" Mr Kilroy-Silk stood down 18 years ago as Labour MP for Knowsley North at the height of the battle with Militant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
