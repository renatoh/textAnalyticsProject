Both are endangered species, unable to come to terms with a rapidly changing habitat, although the mountain forest stream frog has to also contend with an epidemic of chytrid fungus, over-harvesting, the effects of climate change, pollution and invasive species. Both are amphibian (Charles's naval days) and both sport high colouring (Charles's Royal Navy No 1 dress). In short, species such as Hyloscirtus princecharlesi could do with a few friends in high places. It will take more than the prince's Rainforest Project to prevent the extinction of the rainforest amphibians. And the danger is that the feelgood factor from token displays of concern replaces the harder task of sustainable development. But, while they still exist, may the partnership between prince and frog be mutually beneficial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
