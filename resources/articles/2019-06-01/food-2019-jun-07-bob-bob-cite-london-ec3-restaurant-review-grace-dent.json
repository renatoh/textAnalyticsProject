Every time it slipped down the schedule, after yet more delays to this \u00a325m refit, I had a touch of the Statler and Waldorfs. Owner Leonid Shutov\u2019s plan was to commandeer level three of the \u00a3225m Leadenhall Building \u2013 or the Cheesegrater as it is unaffectionately called by Londoners who powerlessly acquiesce to these cute nicknames for hideous skyscrapers. Shutov would create a bigger, better, kookier, mid-air version of his firstborn, Soho\u2019s Bob Bob Ricard. It\u2019s worth noting that the original, classic Bob Bob feels like a fictitious, Kardashian-class Trans-Siberian Express dining carriage envisaged by Tim Robbins. It is a dark, glamorous, wilfully daft caviar-and-chicken-pie palace. \u201cPress for champagne\u201d tempts a button at every booth; and, as gimmicks go, that one has never got old. The all-new, reimagined Bob Bob would feature, we\u2019d heard, rare Japanese bookbinding paper on the walls, identical twin private dining rooms \u2013 one in red and one in blue; 1888 Baron de Sigognac armagnac on the menu at \u00a3830 a pour, and 48,000 rare imported wall bolts pinning the whole hot mess together. You could still press for champagne, but now your table number would flicker on a ticker-tape neon track running around the walls. The highly respected chef Eric Chavot joined the project and stayed put, despite Bob Bob Cit\u00e9 feeling, at times, as imminent as a Morrissey and Marr reunion or a new George RR Martin release date. But I have eaten those words \u2013 with a side of escargot en persillade. Bob Bob Cit\u00e9 is open and, like it or loathe it, you cannot possibly ignore it. It is vast, eccentric, luxurious and shiny \u2013 oh so very shiny, like having dinner on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. I ate twice here in one week, lingering on both occasions for multiple hours, chipping away at Chavot\u2019s world-class, sturdy onion soup with baguette et beurre d\u2019Isigny, or demolishing the excellent, albeit flamboyant, lemon meringue tart. Because, in the privacy of a Bob Bob Cit\u00e9 booth, with such good service and the real world so very far below, there\u2019s a level of escapism that is wholly seductive. Restaurant World is on shaky ground in 2019, but at Bob Bob Cit\u00e9 it\u2019s 1997: London is swinging, money is flowing; let\u2019s all have a round of -18 degree Imperia vodka shots in tiny fancy glasses and stay out until one of us is pregnant by a Gallagher brother. I must stress that Bob Bob Cit\u00e9 is more than a triumph of posh hand soap, imported lampshades and over-delicious food. What Shutov\u2019s eccentric dreamscape needed was a base of solid French cooking, and though Chavot\u2019s relatively short menu is rife with Gallic glamour, you will be fed. You won\u2019t leave hungry \u2013 bankrupt, perhaps, but not hungry. There are oysters gratin\u00e9e teamed with black truffle hollandaise, and a good, fresh salade de tomate with silverskin anchovies. There\u2019s a small, fat bowl of Scottish rump beef steak tartare with soft-boiled quail\u2019s egg and, from \u201cles grillades\u201d, a ribeye steak with shallots at \u00a332 and lobster thermidor at \u00a348.50. Perhaps the best thing on the menu is the relatively simple grilled sea bream, its skin rubbed with lemon and saffron, that comes served with roasted cherry tomatoes \u2013 a snip at a mere \u00a335. The language of Bob Bob Cit\u00e9\u2019s menu is a sort of restaurant Esperanto: thick slices of smoked salmon on a fancy, caviar-strewn potato salad are \u201cchunky saumon fum\u00e9\u201d \u2013 despite that sounding like something deluxe one might buy in Aldi for a cat. The vegetable pie has been sent to Siberia, returned to London via Paris, and is now on menu as \u201cLe \u2018Pie\u2019 du Mara\u00eecher\u201d. It is a delicate, flat, delicious, prettily embossed, heart-valve-clogging dish of jerusalem artichoke and king oyster mushrooms in a sea-green champagne and truffle velout\u00e9. \u201cI am eating a small mushroom pie for \u00a321.50 and it doesn\u2019t even have a pastry bottom. The chips are an extra seven pounds,\u201d I text to my brother as an act of wilful and ongoing north/south provocation. \u201cAbsolute robbing bastards,\u201d he replies, as is standard, eating a Ginsters Piri Piri Slice in a layby. \u201cYou understand nothing about fine dining,\u201d I reply, airily. One of us is certainly in the right here. But after many years, I\u2019m still just not sure who. \u2022 Bob Bob Cit\u00e9 122 Leadenhall Street, London EC3, 020-3928 6600. Open all week, noon-3.30pm, 5.30pm-midnight. About \u00a370 a head, plus drinks and service.
