It is a daunting piece of history for the present side to absorb but it also means that the reward if they pull off a win will be enormous \u2013 a place in Scottish rugby legend alongside such players as Ian Smith, Wilson Shaw, Peter Brown and the side who went on to win a grand slam in 1984, iconic figures from the only four bright spots in exactly a century of Scottish misery at Twickenham. Worse still from a dark-blue perspective, results have been getting worse and the difference between Murrayfield and Twickenham starker: since the turn of the century England have scored more than 40 points in every game bar one on their own patch, while Scotland have won three and drawn one at their home. Richie Gray, the baby of the Scotland squad, did not arrive in the world until 1989, six months after the last time his nation even scrapped out a draw in London but he still looked relaxed and claimed to be confident ahead of his first trip to the home of English rugby. \"I suppose you could say I've never lost there either, that's one point of view,\" said the lock forward, who is in his first season of international rugby. \"But yes, we are confident. We know how tough it will be, England are playing really well at the moment and full of confidence so we're fully aware of the challenge. But we've had a good week's training and we're really looking forward to it. I can't wait to get down there. \"England have a big front five but they're also very dynamic. Defensively, they work very hard for each other and from the attack point of view, they're always very keen to get their hands on the ball. They make the contact area a real hassle for other teams. It's a tough challenge but one that we, as a Scottish front five, relish.\" In what has been a disappointing Six Nations for the Scots, with defeats against France, Wales and Ireland, the last two at Murrayfield, Gray has been one of few positives to emerge. At 6ft 8in, topped by a mop of bleached blond hair and weighing almost 20st, he really is impossible to miss. But Scotland have had equally impressive physical specimens in their second row before and few have managed to display the athleticism, work rate and ball skills that characterise Gray's play. \"I've learned just how ruthless Test-match rugby is and how challenging it is,\" he says. \"Obviously I've come on but not that far. There's huge room for improvement. There are parts of my game I'm constantly working on and I've a long way to go. \"As a team, it is frustrating that we have come close in games and haven't come away with victories but you can't get too caught up in that. It's all in the past and we're fully focused on England.\" If there is any place in the world guaranteed not to allow being the most recognisable figure in the nation's rugby side go to your head, Gray's native Glasgow is it. \"I've been stopped in the street, but [it was] nothing to do with rugby. It was to do with the blond hair and somebody wanting a picture because I was so tall,\" he says. \"Life has not really changed at all.\" Whether a win at Twickenham and a special place in Scottish rugby lore would make any difference is debatable \u2013 but Gray would love to put the idea to the test."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
