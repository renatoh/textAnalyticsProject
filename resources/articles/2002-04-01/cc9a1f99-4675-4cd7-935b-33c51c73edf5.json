David Byrne, the health commissioner, complained this week that \"Germany is obstructing the commission in its campaign, particularly against tobacco advertising\". He and others in Brussels are still smarting from last month's fiasco at the World Health Organisation's talks in Geneva on tobacco control. The commission had wanted all 15 member states to line up in favour of a ban on direct and indirect forms of tobacco advertising. But Germany, backed by Austria and Luxembourg, opposed the move, and the commission was only able to claim that a large majority of member states were on side. In October 2000, Germany won a European court of justice ruling forcing the commission to withdraw a nascent directive that would have banned tobacco advertising in the cinema, on posters and ashtrays. Brussels fears that a new watered-down directive, which aims to ban ads on the radio, internet and in print media, could also prove too much for the Germans. One of the paradoxes of a country that spends twice as much as Britain on its health care is that it is awash with tobacco advertising. Some 100,000 Germans die each year from tobacco- related illnesses, yet an EU directive setting maximum nicotine and tar limits has also provoked Berlin's ire. It wants cigarettes earmarked for export to be exempt and has approached the European court of justice for a ruling. It insists that tobacco advertising is a matter for national governments and accuses the commission of exceeding its authority. \"The rules on who is responsible for what must be respected,\" said a spokeswoman for the consumer affairs ministry which is headed by a Green, Renate K\u00fcnast. EU officials claim that German politicians are in the tobacco industry's pocket. \"There are strong links between the two,\" one official said. \"And the tobacco industry is very good at lobbying.\" Another powerful pressure group is the media, which is extremely reluctant to lose such a wealthy advertiser. \"German publishers see a danger that a ban will start with tobacco but will lead to a ban on alcohol advertising,\" a Brussels official said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
