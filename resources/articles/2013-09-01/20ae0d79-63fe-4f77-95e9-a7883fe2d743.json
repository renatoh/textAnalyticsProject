Linguists might note the phrase copper-bottomed. Quite distinctive in its way, and indicative of great strength of feeling, not to mention hostility. Few know the source, and this is not definitive, but oddly enough if you search the Conservative party website for the use of \"copper-bottomed\", only one speaker jumps out. He uses the phrase in two different speeches, one in 2007 and one in 2008. And the copper-bottomed speaker? Hello, PM Dave. \u2022 Meanwhile, with the government content for internet companies to monitor everything so long as they hand over all the info, how long before they crack down on the subversives behind the Conversative party? Mistype Conservative in a search, and the voter seeking direction ends up with material very different to that placed into the public domain by acolytes of PM Dave. For a start, all those featured seem to be standup comedians. The altered biography of Dave himself looks authentic but isn't as he would like. \"In his first few months as Blighty's prime minister, David Cameron has led a government that has set out bold action to deal with Blighty's deficit; established a radical programme of kid-prison, health and welfare reform; and set out a funny idea of demolishing the big society.\" Harmless, you might say, but why should that stop the authorities finding these people and arresting them? Eight hours' detention at least. \u2022 To the Daily Mail, where they are rightly prudish about not printing photographs of naked breasts to protect readers' sensibilities \u2013 except online, of course. But when it comes to the quest to illustrate its hugely profitable weekly health section, needs must. This week's informative piece \"Diabetes pill gives men's love life a lift\" is accompanied by a picture of the famous Cerne Abbas giant. Carved on a Dorset chalk hill centuries ago, the giant evidently has no need of a diabetes pill. Are standards slipping as editor in chief Paul Dacre approaches his 65th birthday on 14 November? \u2022 To the foreign desk, where we find Quebec's secularist premier Pauline Marois in badmouthing mood. Her target, dear reader, is the English. She says secularist France \"isn't perfect\", but \"in England, they're knocking each other over the head and throwing bombs because of multiculturalism and nobody knowing any more who they are in that society\". A heroine for the EDL, we think. \u2022 And to the sale rooms, and further proof that people will pay top dollar for almost anything. This, from the catalogue for the online auction being organised next week by Fraser's Auctions. \"LOT 196. The 9/11 attacks \u2026 A 10x8\" colour reproduction photograph of the moment President Bush was informed of the terrorist attack on the US while in Florida attending an educational event at Booker Elementary School. Inscribed by the president's chief of staff Andy Card, quoting himself: \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack!\" Bids start at \u00a3600. Something for the sitting room, perhaps. \u2022 Finally, to longevity and the Guyanese novelist ER Braithwaite, who made a surprise appearance when his 1959 masterwork To Sir, With Love, was given its stage premiere on Tuesday night. Braithwaite is getting on a bit \u2013 some say he is 93. Others claim he's 101. In any event, he flew all the way from New York to Northampton for the event. Braithwaite's presence was announced by Stars In Their Eyes star Matthew Kelly, who hauled him up in front of the audience \u2013 but it nearly went horribly wrong. The author, dressed in a dapper suit, wobbled precariously and had to be caught by a very alert Kelly. What a story it might have been: centenarian scribe flies in from New York and comes to grief in Northants. Some things just weren't meant to be.
