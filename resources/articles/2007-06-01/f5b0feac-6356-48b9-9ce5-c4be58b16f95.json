Last week postal workers voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action in protest over pay and the threat of job cuts. If the strike goes ahead, Royal Mail will lose business customers to the private sector and might have to compensate those whose mail gets delayed. That would render more urgent the need to cut costs and modernise sorting systems, plans for which triggered the strike threat in the first place. The postal workers have a solid grievance. Their pay offer is well below inflation and thousands of their colleagues have already been laid off. Meanwhile, their bosses are among the highest paid employees of the state. But this is not some throw-back to the Seventies, with a militant union holding a state behemoth to ransom. Royal Mail is in difficulty not because it is unreformed, but because it is half-reformed, forced by government to act like a private company, but with costly public obligations. In 2006 the postal market was opened to competition. In preparation for that moment, Royal Mail had to start behaving less like a job creation scheme and more like a business. It turned \u00a31.1bn of losses in 2002 into profits of \u00a3335m in 2005. But it struggles to make money in parts of its business - the ones the public most cares about: the Post Office network and the delivery of domestic mail, especially in remote parts of the country. The Post Office survives only with cash infusions from the Department of Trade and Industry. The government is committed to liberalisation and in a free postal market it will be ever harder to justify subsidising the dominant player. But privatising Royal Mail, the logical next step in liberalisation, could be politically ruinous. Even the Tories, when they were scraping the barrel of state assets to sell off in the mid-Nineties, balked at the idea. They knew that privatisation would kill the traditional Post Office. Britain is in the middle of a communications boom. With its respected brand and national network it is certain that a bit of imagination could turn the Post Office into a thriving business, developing its role as a trusted point of contact between citizen and the state for the 21st century. But imagination is in short supply. Royal Mail management sees modernisation purely in terms of corporate belt-tightening and the union seems to be rejecting any notion of modernisation at all. A strike this summer looks inevitable. That will be only the first delivery of trouble for the government from a Post Office gradually sinking into crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
