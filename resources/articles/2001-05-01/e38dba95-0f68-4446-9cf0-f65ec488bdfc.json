De gustibus etc. Those who labour in the stony vineyard of book reviewing, and watch the contradictory shifts of the literary critical weather, know this better than most. A good illustration of the capricious nature of literary judgment comes from an entertaining extract from the latest Missouri Review. This learned journal recently ran a selection of readers' reports culled from the archives of the great American publisher. Alfred A. Knopf. 'Rather than give the impression of a golden age,' says the Missouri Review, 'they portray a literary moment as wayward and fallible as our own.' Thus, in 1949, although one Knopf reader professed to like the stories of Jorge Luis Borges, he observed that 'they are utterly untranslatable, at least into anything that could be expected to sell more than 750 copies'. In 1952, another reader judged that Ana\u00efs Nin's Spy in the House of Love, in its time an important novel about a woman's relationship with several men, was the work of 'a small, arbitrary, overpraised talent who has been able to hide her emptiness behind a lot of chinoiserie'. If you think that's bad, there's the Knopf reader's reaction, in 1966, to Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, the frank disbelief that 'any set of characters could be so entirely and inexplicably nasty, so sick, so unhappy'. These readers' reports are all anonymous. One Knopf employee with a particularly, almost hilariously, bad track record was a certain Herbert Weinstock. Having slammed the door on Borges, grouchy Weinstock reviewed a translation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's latest with the immortal words: 'It's Poland and those rich Jews again', warning of the 'endless editorial work' in prospect if old Knopf was rash enough to add Singer to his list. Weinstock did not confine his negativity to works in translation. According to the Missouri Review (to whom all thanks for this material), he also passed over Norman Mailer's Deer Park and James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room. Similar anecdotes can be found in the archives and folk memory of British publishing: the nearly 20 imprints that rejected Lord of the Flies before William Golding's astonishing debut caught the eye of Charles Monteith, my old boss at Faber &amp; Faber; the apocryphal report on J.G. Ballard's Crash ('The author is beyond psychiatric help... do not publish') etc. Only this week, Nick Hornby was reminding me that Fever Pitch was rejected by half-a-dozen publishers before an editor at the the then-independent Victor Gollancz spotted its distinctive qualities. Where the publisher's reader works behind a cloak of anonymity, the newspaper reviewer's lapses in judgment are all the more alarming for being so publicly displayed. There are any number of ways to bark up the wrong tree. Sidney Smith, famously, observed: 'I never read a book before reviewing it; it prejudices a man so.' Cyril Connolly, formerly of The Observer, boasted in the introduction to The Condemned Playground (1945): 'I stay very close to the text - no soaring eagle but a low-slung basset who hunts by scent and keeps his nose to the ground.' Fair enough. But sometimes it's only the 'soaring eagle' who has the perspective to place original new work in its proper perspective, and the courage to defend his or her vision against the usual literary critical rodents who, from a variety of motives, refuse to acknowledge a genuinely significant new voice. The much-disparaged or much-rejected writer, of course, never forgets. James Joyce, who in his day tested the literary critical establishment to its limits, wrote to a friend in April 1932, long after his work had finally found its due recognition, that 'no less than 22 publishers and printers read the manuscript of Dubliners and when at last it was printed some very kind person bought out the entire edition and had it burnt in Dublin.' Inevitably, in the literary history of any time, our own included, these glitches in critical response get forgotten or, worse, laid at the contemporary reviewer's door like so much roadkill. Professional reviewers get a bad press. To F. Scott Fitzgerald, they were 'light men who bubble at the mouth with enthusiasm because they see other bubbles floating around'. What's neglected are those occasions when an honest book reviewer who has kept his or her 'nose to the ground' has got it right and made a real difference to a writer's career. I don't myself think that reviews alone really sell books in quantity, but they can, and should, contribute to the formation of public taste. After that, it's over to the Romans. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk World of books debate"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
