As head of the passport control office in the British consulate in the 1930s, he bent every rule - and broke a few more - in order to hand out visas to Jews fleeing the Third Reich, despite the resistance of Foreign Office bosses back in London. Today, a plaque was unveiled to Foley at the new British embassy in the German capital, in a ceremony which saw survivors - and their children - fly in from Tel Aviv, whilst some of Mr Foley's surviving relatives also came to hear their uncle honoured. Having been originally sent to Berlin in 1920 as a member of the then relatively new Secret Intelligence Service, he was risking his own life with his actions. He had no diplomatic immunity to protect him if the Nazi regime had gleaned what he was up to. Given the title of \"passport control officer\", his original task was to spy on Bolsheviks in the German capital - regarded as a hotbed of communists in the 1920s. But, having seen Hitler's attempted putsch, imprisonment and the writing of Mein Kampf, he was ahead of his London minders in foreseeing the plight of the Jews. Strictly speaking, he was only allowed to issue visas for Palestine - then under British mandate - if the applicant was either a skilled agricultural worker (unlikely among middle-class Berlin Jews), or had a bank account in Palestine with a \u00a31,000 deposit already cashed in. In reality, he went further than turning a blind eye, to the extent that historians reckon he saved 10,000 Jews, or possibly more, from the concentration camps. Today, 62-year old Peter Weiss, whose mother escaped the Nazis in 1933 in a visa given to her by Foley, said: \"He was a small, insignificant man in glasses, but today me, and all the children of the survivors, are his legacy. \"He was a Mensch, one of the righteous.\" Indeed, he has already been given the Medal of Righteousness, the highest honour the Israeli state can bestow on a gentile, by the Yad Vashem holocaust centre in Jerusalem. British ambassador Peter Torry called Foley \"a British hero\", who \"tore up the rulebook\" to save Jewish lives. \u0095 Matthew Tempest in Berlin"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
