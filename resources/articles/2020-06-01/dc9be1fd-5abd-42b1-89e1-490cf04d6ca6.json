Kean said his office was incorrect when it told Guardian Australia that the government would not be introducing a standalone strategy to tackle air pollution after four years of planning that included a summit on the issue. He said it was an error due to a \u201cmix up\u201d, and that the government intends to deliver the plan, which is three years overdue, early next year. Labor\u2019s Kate Washington responded that \u201cit sounds like somebody told the truth and then they realised the truth didn\u2019t sound very good\u201d. Guardian Australia reported on Saturday the government had dropped its commitment to a standalone clean air strategy for the state and would instead absorb air pollution into other policies, including its zero emissions targets. The story prompted anger from communities affected by air pollution, such as the Hunter Valley, as well as organisations that have spent four years contributing to the development of the plan. The NSW government held a clean air summit in 2017 and promised to announce a statewide framework to reduce toxic air and the health problems it causes later that year. The NSW Environment Protection Authority presented a draft proposal to the minister in May 2019 but it has never been released. In response to questions last week, a spokesman from Kean\u2019s office said: \u201cRather than releasing a standalone plan for clean air, the NSW government is integrating air quality as a key component of other strategic priorities.\u201d The statement said the government would instead factor air pollution into policies including the state\u2019s net zero emissions plan, the NSW electricity strategy and a plan for the transition to electric and hybrid vehicles. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the government\u2019s position that we have shelved the policy as a standalone document,\u201d Kean said on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not my intention. I fully intend to have a standalone strategy. There was a miscommunication from my team and I want to correct the record. \u201cWe are absolutely committed to a standalone clean air strategy. There was a mix-up in my media team with regard to the statement that was issued.\u201d An estimated 3,000 deaths per year in Australia are due to urban air pollution. Kean\u2019s comments come as a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the hazardous air quality caused by the 2019-20 bushfire disaster and by drought gets under way, with hearings commencing on Wednesday. He said the fires had highlighted the importance of clean air after the state experienced the worst air quality in its history, which had affected people\u2019s health and everyday way of life. \u201cI think we need to do more work on making sure that people have the information they need in relation to bushfire smoke,\u201d Kean said. \u201cFor example, during bad bushfire seasons, it\u2019s really important for people to be able to plan when to go and do exercise outdoors and have accurate and timely information.\u201d He said he wanted to explore if there were better technology options available to make this easier for communities, especially those most affected by air pollution. \u201cWe also need to make sure the clean air plan integrates with other government policies, like the electricity strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this end, I intend to do further consultation on clean air initiatives, especially regarding bushfire smoke, this year with a view to publishing the finalised plan early next year.\u201d Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Kate Washington, expressed doubt about the minister\u2019s explanation. \u201cI would say the statement was unequivocal and then the minister has realised the communities affected by air pollution feel betrayed,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a backflip on a backflip. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing that he didn\u2019t like a story and realised maybe he actually has to come out with a plan.\u201d Washington said the government should make its proposal publicly available soon, instead of waiting until 2021. \u201cIf it was the intention to do a standalone plan, it has been sitting on his desk for 12 months now and he should release it as soon as possible,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
