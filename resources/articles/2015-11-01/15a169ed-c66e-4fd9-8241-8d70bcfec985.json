There\u2019s change afoot in this last series", "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a while. Three years in fact, since the last series of Peep Show (Channel 4). They \u2013 Mitchell, Webb, writers Bain and Armstrong \u2013 have become busier and more successful, creating, procreating etc, since this all started. Where were we, then? Oh yes, Jeremy hit on Mark\u2019s girlfriend, Dobby, and she ran away to New York. So Jeremy ruined Mark\u2019s life. Par for the course, really: they\u2019ve being ruining each other\u2019s lives all along, locked in an awkward PoV man-hug of mutual disgust but unable to let go, each dragging the other down to their own little part of hell. Just six months have passed in Peep Show time. They \u2013 Mark and Jeremy \u2013 are reunited for Super Hans\u2019s stag do. What? Super Hans is settling down, marrying an actual woman, as opposed to a narcotic substance? That\u2019s ridiculous. Imagine if he too procreated and became someone\u2019s father! (Oh, hang on, he is \u2013 the twins! He\u2019s always going on about the twins \u2026 actually, where are the twins?) Well, at least, the stag should be a giggle, one last blast of depravity \u2026 No! He\u2019s detoxing for the wedding. They\u2019re only doing \u2013 and only talking about \u2013 juice. Sober Hans. The stag is, as Jez says, \u201cone load of PG-rated, Disney-assed, Which? magazine- approved, childproof, high-vitamin fucking bullshit\u201d. Well, for about five minutes, until resolve inevitably crumbles; they have a little sip of lager, just to wet the whistle. Then another, and next thing you know they\u2019re all in the toilet, singing filthy songs, Jeremy\u2019s hitting on the barmaid, whistles well and properly sodden. Back to normal, then back to Super Hans\u2019s flat, where Jeremy now lives, in the bathroom. \u201cI mean it\u2019s not Number One Hyde Park Palace, but it suits me down to the ground,\u201d says Jeremy. Until Hans comes in for a Number Two Hyde Park Palace, so to speak, in Jeremy\u2019s bedroom/kitchen. Then it\u2019s disgusting. Matt King\u2019s Super Hans is everyone\u2019s favourite, right? One of the comedy supporting characters/performances of the century so far, up there with Michelle Gomez in Green Wing. Here\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll feature as much in the rest of the series as he does in this episode. And that he\u2019ll give up this juice nonsense. Mark also has a new flatmate of his own, from the sort of bank where he now sort of works. Jerry, he\u2019s called, to make things even more hurtful for Jeremy. \u201cI\u2019m the new, improved you,\u201d Jerry gloats to Jeremy. \u201cTotal fucking arsehole,\u201d is what Jeremy calls Jerry. Which is about spot on: Jerry is into William Morris, the socialist wallpaper fella, and reading books. What a TFA! It\u2019s Jerry v Jeremy then, in the fight for Mark\u2019s affection (spare room). There\u2019s only going to be one winner, especially when Super Hans \u2013 who wants Jeremy out of his bath or his marriage will go tits-up before it\u2019s even started \u2013 shows up. Lovely from Tim Key as Jerry, by the way, while he lasted. All back on then, Mark and Jeremy, for one final series. They can\u2019t help it, they are drawn inexorably and inevitably together. Underneath the mutual destruction, the bickering and sordidness, there\u2019s mutual dependence, the tiniest ember of genuine warmth, of companionship, of \u2013 whisper it \u2013 actual friendship. Also a hint of truth; maybe you\u2019ve got a friendship a bit like that, a relationship or a marriage? No? I see quite a lot of both in myself, worryingly. Even if you don\u2019t recognise yourself in them you\u2019ll recognise theirs as a special relationship, perhaps only ever really rivalled \u2013 in television comedy \u2013 by Beavis and Butt-head. There are plenty of other, smaller truths. Like, an evening without either booze or television is a very long evening. And everyone hates futons. You don\u2019t? Yes, you bloody do, everyone does. And they\u2019re indestructible, so they\u2019re here for ever. It\u2019s both sad, and right, that this is the final series of Peep Show. Sad because it has been brilliant, properly original, very funny, but somehow a little wise and, at times, even touching. Also so very of its time, with its voyeurism, nastiness, thinking- out-loud and point-of-view self-absorption and self-obsession, to the point where you could say it has captured a generation. Which is also why it\u2019s right that it\u2019s coming to an end; that time won\u2019t last for ever, the generation is growing up; even Super Hans, maybe. Not quite yet, though. First Jerry needs to be bagged up, in his green sleeping bag, drawstring drawn, like The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Then waterboarded, with beer! And sent down in the lift. Ha! \u2022 This review was amended on 12 November 2015. Super Hans is a father, contrary to what we originally implied."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
