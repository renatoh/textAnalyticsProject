Meanwhile Lord Hutton gave full backing to the government's conduct in the affair, and cleared the prime minister, Tony Blair, of any wrongdoing. In a 75-minute summary of his findings, delivered at the high court, the judge ran through the sequence of events that began with the writing of the September 2002 dossier on Iraq's weapons and ended with the death of Dr Kelly. Mr Blair has called for those who had impugned his integrity and that of the government to withdraw their allegations. \u00b7 Read the main points of Lord Hutton's statement BBC chairman steps down Mr Davies decided to carry the can for Lord Hutton's damning verdict on the BBC's handling of the David Kelly affair. He said was writing to the prime minister to advise him of his resignation. \"I've been brought up to believe that you cannot choose your own referee, and that the referee's decision is final,\" he said in a brief statement tonight. \"There is an honourable tradition in British public life that those charged with authority at the top of an organisation should accept responsibility for what happens in that organisation.\" \u00b7 Gavyn Davies resigns Hutton lambasts BBC Mr Davies' resignation came just after the director general, Greg Dyke, had issued a statement accepting that \"certain key allegations\" reported by Andrew Gilligan were wrong, and said that the BBC apologised for them. The corporation's robust defence of itself in the face of the government's complaints over the story came in for heavy criticism from Lord Hutton. He said that the corporation's management had failed to appreciate that Gilligan's notes did not support the most serious of his allegations. He added that the governors should have recognised and investigated the differences between them. Lord Hutton said that the dossier's 45-minute claim may be proved wrong, but that Gilligan's allegation that the government knew it was wrong when the dossier was published was \"unfounded\", because intelligence chiefs believed their source was reliable. He described Mr Gilligan's report as a \"grave allegation\" and a slur on the government's integrity. BBC editors and managers, including the director-general, the editor of the Today programme, the head of radio news, and the governors, did not escape Lord Hutton's censure. He concluded that Mr Dyke and the other governors had failed to ask for an investigation into the veracity of Gilligan's report. They had also failed to appreciate that Gilligan's notes \"did not support\" his May 29 broadcast on the Today programme. \"The governors are to be criticised for failing to make a more detailed investigation into whether the allegation by Mr Gilligan was properly supported by his notes, and failing to give proper and adequate consideration to whether the BBC should publicly acknowledge that this very grave allegation should not have been broadcast,\" Lord Hutton said. Had they asked for Gilligan's notes, he said, \"they would probably have discovered that the notes did not support the allegations that the government knew that the 45-minutes claim was probably wrong\". Lord Hutton said that the email sent by the editor of Today, Kevin Marsh, to Stephen Mitchell, the head of radio news - which admitted that Gilligan's story was \"marred by flawed reporting\" and \"loose use of language\" - should have passed to BBC bosses before they replied to accusations by Alastair Campbell, No 10's former director of communications. The judge said the fact that Richard Sambrook, the BBC's head of news, and the governors did not know about the email \"shows a defect in the operation of the BBC's management system for the consideration of complaints in respect of broadcasts\". He ruled that BBC managers and governors were wrong to defend Gilligan's story without knowing the full facts, and cleared the government of Gilligan's allegation that it had \"sexed up\" the dossier to advance its case for war. The scale of Lord Hutton's criticism has sent shockwaves through the BBC, particularly because the way in which the intelligence dossier was drawn up was vindicated by him, despite reservations expressed by some intelligence sources during the inquiry about the language used. \u00b7 Hutton delivers damning verdict on BBC \u00b7 What Hutton said about Andrew Gilligan \u00b7 What Hutton said about the BBC governors \u00b7 What Hutton said about Gavyn Davies \u00b7 Gilligan comes out fighting after Hutton drubbing Blair exonerated by report Lord Hutton found Mr Blair innocent of presenting an intelligence dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to parliament that had been \"sexed up\" by his personal staff, particularly Mr Campbell. He also found the prime minister innocent of authoring a strategy to leak Dr Kelly's name to the media as part of the government's battle with the BBC. Lord Hutton said that Mr Campbell had made it clear to the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), John Scarlett - who was charged with drafting the document - that \"nothing should be stated in the dossier with which the intelligence community were not entirely happy\". He found that it was not \"improper for Mr Scarlett and the JIC to take into account suggestions as to drafting made by No 10 Downing Street\", as the dossier was to be presented to parliament and the public. However, he did wonder whether the \"desire of the prime minister to have a dossier which, while consistent with the available intelligence, was as strong as possible in relation to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's WMD, may have subconsciously influenced Mr Scarlett and the other members of the JIC to make the wording of the dossier somewhat stronger than it would have been if it had been contained in a normal JIC assessment\". On the naming of the late weapons inspector, meanwhile, Lord Hutton concluded \"that there was no dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous strategy by the government covertly to leak Dr Kelly's name to the media\". He accused Mr Campbell of \"raising the temperature\" of the row with the BBC by the tone of his complaints. But he said the governors should have recognised that their legitimate desire to protect the BBC's independence was not incompatible with investigating the complaints. \u00b7 Hutton saves Blair's reputation \u00b7 Campbell calls for BBC resignations Hoon escapes harsh criticism The Hutton report criticises the Ministry of Defence over the way in which it dealt with Dr Kelly before his death. But the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, was not singled out for any of the specific criticism that had been expected. Mr Hoon was even cheered by Labour backbenchers as he arrived in the Commons to hear Tony Blair's response to Lord Hutton's report. However, Lord Hutton said that the MoD was \"at fault and is to be criticised\" for not informing Dr Kelly that its press office would confirm his name if a journalist suggested it. This, the law lord said, would have left Dr Kelly feeling \"badly let down\". \u00b7 Hoon escapes expected criticism \u00b7 What Hutton says about the MOD Intelligence services cleared Lord Hutton's report painted a picture of the country's intelligence services working in full and proper cooperation with the government, which used information gathered by them in good faith in the compilation of the dossier on Iraq's WMD. The inquiry report confirmed that the dossier had been prepared and drafted by a small team of assessment staff of the JIC. As the head of the JIC, overall responsibility for the drafting of the dossier lay with John Scarlett. The report also suggested that claims of divisions between different agencies within the intelligence services were exaggerated. While clearly laying the responsibility for the content of the September 2002 dossier at the feet of Mr Scarlett, Lord Hutton went on to acknowledge that pressure from No 10 could have affected the wording. However, Lord Hutton declared himself satisfied that \"Mr Scarlett, the other members of the JIC and the members of the assessment staff engaged in the drafting of the dossier were concerned to ensure that the contents of the dossier were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC\". \u00b7 What Hutton says about the intelligence services Angry Blair demands apology Mr Blair arrived in the Commons chamber soon after Lord Hutton's summary of his report. He was greeted by a roar of support from his own backbenchers and he was cheered again as he rose to speak. \"The report itself is an extraordinarily thorough, detailed and clear document. It leaves no room for doubts or interpretation. We accept it in full,\" he said. \"What has sustained and fuelled that [media] interest has been, to put it bluntly, a claim of lying, of deceit, of duplicity on my part personally and that of the government,\" he said. \"The allegation that I or anyone else lied to this house, or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on WMD, is itself the real lie, and I simply ask that those that made it, and those who have repeated it over all these months, now withdraw it, fully, openly and clearly.\" \u00b7 Angry Blair claims vindication \u00b7 Read the full text of Blair's statement to the Commons Judge considers legal action over Sun leak Lord Hutton concluded his statement by saying that he \"deplored\" the Sun's publication today of leaked extracts of his report. \"It was known that, in the public interest, I sought to ensure that the contents of my report would remain confidential until it was published,\" he said. The judge said he was giving \"urgent consideration\" to \"what investigative and legal action I should take against the newspaper and its source\". \u00b7 Hutton considers legal action over leak Kelly 'took own life' Earlier in his statement, the law lord said he was \"satisfied that Dr Kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist\". His death was hastened by taking a \"concoction\" of pills, said the judge, adding that no third party was involved. He said that nobody involved in the controversy could have \"contemplated Dr Kelly would take his own life\", no matter what pressures he had been put under. \"Whatever pressures and strains Dr Kelly was subject to by the decisions and actions taken in the weeks before his death, I am satisfied that no one realised or should have realised that these pressures and strains might have driven him to take his own life or contribute to his decision to do so,\" Lord Hutton said. \u00b7 Kelly: 'not an easy man to help' Kelly family urges action Dr Kelly's family has demanded that the government take steps to ensure that an ordeal similar to the late scientist's \"will never be repeated\". In a statement, they said: \"No other person should have to suffer the pressure he experienced.\" They praised Lord Hutton's handling of the inquiry, even though his findings \"differ in part from their submissions to him\". \u00b7 Kelly family: 'Ensure his ordeal is not repeated' \u00b7 Full text of the Kelly family's statement"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
