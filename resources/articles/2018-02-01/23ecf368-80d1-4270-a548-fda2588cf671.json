As they bid to get their Six Nations campaign back on track after it came badly off the rails in Cardiff, Scotland know they will need a more measured approach on Sunday at home to France who, contrary to the received wisdom before the championship, now look the more settled and composed of the two squads. The France coach, Jacques Brunel, has made three changes to the team who began last week\u2019s 13-15 defeat by Ireland \u2013 half the number of alterations made by Townsend after his side\u2019s traumatic 34-7 defeat in Wales. The return of the veteran Lyon stand-off Lionel Beauxis after a six-year absence is a gamble but one which could increase the pressure on his opposite number, Finn Russell. After a frustrating spell with Bordeaux, Beauxis has been rejuvenated by the Lyon coach, Pierre Mignoni, according to Brunel. \u201cI thanked Mignoni, because he has resurrected him,\u201d the France coach told L\u2019Equipe. \u201cWe know his talent, his qualities \u2013 he\u2019s not always been able to express them at the highest level. Since the start of the season he\u2019s shown great things.\u201d Beauxis comes straight into the team in place of the injured Matthieu Jalibert, while Anthony Belleau, the teenager\u2019s replacement against Ireland, again starts on the bench. Geoffrey Doumayrou, ruled out of the Ireland game by a slight knock, returns at outside-centre, with R\u00e9mi Lamerat moving inside and Henry Chavancy dropping out of the squad. The only change in the pack sees Mathieu Tauleigne come in for his first start at No 8, replacing the injured Kevin Gourdon. Partnering his Glasgow club-mate Ali Price at half-back against the Welsh, Russell appeared to be one of those Scots who misinterpreted their head coach\u2019s game plan, failing to vary the tempo as required. The restoration of Greig Laidlaw at scrum-half is in part designed to help Russell understand the intention is to play at a higher tempo than the opposition over the game as a whole, not in each individual play. It is not so much a question of curbing Russell\u2019s enthusiasm altogether, Laidlaw explained, as reining in his impetuosity. \u201cFinn gets excitable and I love that side of him, but he wants to always attack,\u201d the Clermont scrum-half said. \u201cI\u2019ll just be encouraging him to pick his head up, see what\u2019s in front of him. If they\u2019ve got 14 boys in the frontline there has to be space in the back field. If there\u2019s space in the back field we get it down there and back our defence. \u201cI\u2019ll just be keeping a tab on him \u2013 make sure he\u2019s not getting too excited. He likes to attack, which is brilliant. I\u2019d never take that away from him.\u201d Price may be more dynamic but Laidlaw\u2019s ability to orchestrate the tempo is peerless. To his detractors, the 32-year-old is more comfortable slowing play down than speeding it up, yet for the time being at least he provides a necessary counterbalance to those team members whose interpretation of the coach\u2019s game plan lacks nuance. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be frantic,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want it to be disciplined rugby but quick rugby. At times we got away from that last weekend. At Test level you\u2019ve got to understand the ebbs and flows of the game. The times that you\u2019re up you need to keep going, keep going, keep hammering. \u201cBut then there will be a time in the game when we\u2019re under the pump, that\u2019s for sure. We\u2019re playing against a good side here and we\u2019ll need to just grab the game and maybe slow it down just for a couple of minutes to get a handle. We\u2019ve got a couple of plays we can go to and settle the nerves, get everybody a touch of the ball. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good plan, and if we can execute it I think we can win. If we start well and play with speed, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll like it.\u201d Laidlaw knows, of course, the converse could also be true. Scotland were thrown off their stride all too easily in Cardiff, and although those six changes by Townsend have brought greater solidity and experience to his team, France can still be expected to probe for the same weaknesses. He said: \u201cThey have speed, power and scrummaging power, so they\u2019re always going to be in games. They\u2019ll always target the scrum: they love their scrumming. I think they\u2019ll back their attacking game as well, and they\u2019ll come after our defence, because we leaked a fair few points at the weekend.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
