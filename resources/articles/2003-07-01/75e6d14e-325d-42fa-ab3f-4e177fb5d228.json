For Rick Dunn, the stroke of Britain's best boat after the pair of James Cracknell and Matthew Pinsent, it presented a personal dilemma: should he follow his heart and row in his favourite event at Henley, or go with his head and race the world's best in Switzerland? The Lucerne decision was controversial and personally hurtful to Dunn. \"We were gutted not to be able to be involved at Henley,\" he said. \"In fact, the boys really wanted to race there as well as Lucerne, but chief coach J\u00fcrgen Grobler said that because the events were only a week apart, it wasn't possible to prepare for both properly.\" So last week no British national squad crews competed at Henley, apart from the Silver Goblets winners Cracknell and Pinsent who will miss Lucerne. Mike Sweeney, the Henley regatta chairman, had assembled an entry of top-class foreign crews to race British opposition, only to see event after event go abroad. Sweeney could hardly conceal his disappointment. During Sunday's prize giving, he pointedly remarked: \"Thank God for Cracknell and Pinsent.\" Sweeney's burden was made all the harder to bear because the four pulled out only at the last minute. But Dunn as explained: \"There was only one thing on our mind when we made that decision and that was an Olympic gold. After the Munich World Cup, and our second behind Germany, we sat down as a crew and realised that we would only have three or four multi-lane races between now and the Olympic final. We need all those so that we get the perfect race in Athens. Of course, Henley is only two abreast.\" In Lucerne Dunn's crew will be hoping to beat the German world champions, whose early pace has beaten the British twice this season. They will also have to contend with a fast Canadian crew, who won well at Henley. A win for the British eight, with Oxford's Robin Bourne-Taylor restored to the line-up, will also be hard to come by. In addition to the Germans, they will face the impressive Canadian world champion eight, who comfortably won the Grand at Henley. There are also strong Canadian boats in the women's events, in which Kath Grainger and Catherine Bishop lead the World Cup pairs rankings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
