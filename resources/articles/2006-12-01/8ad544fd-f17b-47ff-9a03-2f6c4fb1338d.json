We should clarify that, while Hizb ut-Tahrir has lobbied for other nations to become caliphates, its UK wing does not campaign for Britain to become one. The movement maintains that it is not banned in the Netherlands or Sudan. In Germany, HT's public activities are proscribed, but membership of the party is not. This is currently the subject of a legal challenge. The Prime Minister has been forced to shelve a central plank of his 'war on terror' strategy after opposition from senior police officers and the Home Office. Plans to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, the radical Islamic group, have been dropped in the past few days following intense discussions between Number 10 and legal advisers. Counter-terrorism sources said Tony Blair had been warned that banning the group, which campaigns for Britain to become a caliphate - a country subject to Islamic law - would serve only as a recruiting agent if the group appealed against the move. The decision is a significant personal blow to Blair, who announced his intention to outlaw it shortly after the London bombings on 7 July, 2005, as part of a 12-point strategy to counter Islamic extremism. On a trip to Pakistan last month, he is understood to have given personal assurances to President Pervez Musharraf that the ban would go ahead. Musharraf made clear to him that outlawing the group - banned in Pakistan since 2003 - must be a priority for Britain. In the past couple of weeks Blair has held high-level discussions with police and counter-terrorism experts with a view to reviving plans to proscribe the group. But The Observer understands he has been persuaded it is impossible based on evidence collected so far. The debate over Hizb ut-Tahrir's right to operate in Britain comes as its influence is growing. The group has a presence in 40 countries. But it is banned in Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, Sudan and in almost every Arab country. Last month a BBC investigation claimed to expose its methods to radicalise young British Muslims. It reported that in Croydon, south London, Hizb ut-Tahrir encouraged an undercover researcher posing as a recruit to commit crimes to 'prove his loyalty'. Hizb ut-Tahrir has denied this and said it intends to sue the BBC. The group's British wing has distanced itself from the more radical views of international sister organisations such as those expressed on leaflets handed out by Hizb ut-Tahrir supporters in Copenhagen which claimed suicide bombings in Israel were 'legitimate' acts of 'martyrdom'. The British wing has also distanced itself from its former leader, Omar Bakri Muhammad, who left the group to set up the more extreme al-Muhajiroun organisation in 1996 and is in exile in Lebanon after being caught on tape praising the London bombers as the 'fantastic four'. Despite public concerns about Hizb ut-Tahrir's perceived extremism, Home Office lawyers, the Foreign Office and representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers have quietly lobbied against outlawing the group and have, for now, won the argument. 'If there was evidence for proscribing Hizb ut-Tahrir, we would support a move to proscribe it,' said Rob Beckley, Acpo lead for communities and counter-terrorism. 'But we think such a move would be counter-productive and not in the spirit of the government's [anti-terrorism] legislation. It is not an offence to hold extreme views.' The news comes as the Conservatives expressed fresh concerns that Britons determined to martyr themselves in the name of jihad are being released into the community because police lack powers to prosecute them. Up to a dozen people suspected of being en route to join the fight against British forces in Iraq or Afghanistan, or to become suicide bombers overseas, have been detained by one major police force alone in the past year. But because evidence gained by covertly intercepting conversations by phone or email is not admissible in British courts, they could not be charged with any serious offence. Patrick Mercer, the Conservative homeland security spokesman, said he was told by Greater Manchester police there was now a persistent pattern of such suspects causing serious concern. 'They were graphically described to me as men who have come to terms with death, who are then going back into the community,' Mercer told The Observer. 'The police are convinced that these are the sort of people who will pull an incident, probably in Manchester but maybe in London or Birmingham or elsewhere.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
