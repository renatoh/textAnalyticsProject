Commissioned by New Zealand police at the cost of NZ$10,000 (A$9,500), the audit examined the recent boom of animal pictures, feel-good moments and memes used by police social media accounts. In slides obtained by the Otago Daily Times under the New Zealand equivalent of freedom of information legislation, the firm concluded the police were doing well, but should post more examples of officers doing work, and fewer \u201cpuppy pics\u201d. It also commended the AFP for its \u201chumour\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d on social media \u2013 published before the AFP conducted two raids on journalists last week. The overwhelmingly positive review, from firm Socialites, called NZ police a \u201cleading social media organisation\u201d. \u201cThe NZ Police do a consistent job of ensuring the tone is appropriate to the content,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor example, the tone is lighter if talking about cats being rescued and appropriately serious when it involves a crime.\u201d But the meme saturation of New Zealand and Australian police media has previously attracted criticism. In 2017, NZ police had to delete a tweet that joked about road deaths with a meme of Steve Carell from the US sitcom The Office on a weekend when nine people died. \u201cWhen you have to tell someone their family member has died in a crash,\u201d the caption read, above a gif of Carrell saying \u201cThis is the worst\u201d. It also apologised for praising a police officer who \u201ctook charge\u201d of \u201can internment camp for Japanese women and children\u201d on International Women\u2019s Day this year. But the 19-slide report did not mention these gaffes, and commended the police Twitter account for \u201cexcellent use of social media self-referential content such as #flatlay \u2013 great for viral pick up.\u201d However, it did say that police media should reduce the proportion of puppies in its posts. \u201cAs we know this is a regular discussion point at police, we\u2019ve also addressed puppies,\u201d it said. \u201cPuppy pics and humorous/humanising content should definitely stay as part of the content\u2026[but] a greater proportion of operational stories will help further build trust &amp; confidence.\u201d In a series of comparisons, it said NZ police had a better social media presence than Fire &amp; Emergency New Zealand, the New Zealand Defence Force and Corrections NZ. It said the Australian federal police were \u201cthe closest example\u201d of another government agency that used \u201chumour and humility\u201d as well as NZ police. Paul Halford, NZ police\u2019s national manager of communications, said social media played an important role in public trust and \u201chelping people be safe\u201d. \u201cMost New Zealanders do not have face-to-face interactions with police officers \u2026 a lot of the information they get about what New Zealand police are doing is online,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose of the audit was to evaluate how NZ Police are performing in the social media space, and how it aligns with supporting our business objectives, especially building trust and confidence in the police. Marketing expert Dee Madigan, the creative director of firm CampaignEdge, said police social media accounts were generally good in their use of humour. \u201cIt\u2019s important that police are liked. That feelgood factor is an important part of their job \u2013 that they are liked and trusted \u2013 and building social media is an important part of that. \u201cThe reality is that people are not going to follow boring accounts. People are on social media partly to be informed, partly to be entertained. It\u2019s almost the price you pay for being there.\u201d But she warned them to be careful of hypocrisy \u2013 especially in the light of the AFP\u2019s recent raids. \u201cI think the AFP online account is good, but you have to be careful. If their offline behaviour is very, very different to their online behaviour \u2013 you have branding inconsistency, and that makes people angry. People will be saying \u2018If you\u2019re raiding journalists, then don\u2019t pretend to be cute and funny.\u2019 \u201cIf they do anything funny now they will probably get smashed for it. It seems like they haven\u2019t, and that would be wise.\u201d The report also analysed 16,000 comments on the various police Facebook pages \u2013 and found that 17% of comments were positive in the Waitemata district page, but only 2% were positive in the Central district page."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
