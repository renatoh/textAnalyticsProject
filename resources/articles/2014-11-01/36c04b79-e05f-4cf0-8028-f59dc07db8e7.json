Even beating Australia will not entirely stem the creeping anxiety before next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup, nor the rising sense of autumnal irritation in the home dressing room. \u201cWe\u2019ve come in for a lot of flak and a lot of things have been questioned,\u201d says Tom Wood, the ever-combative Northampton flanker. \u201cBut if we\u2019ve underperformed so gravely and are so far away from where people expect having lost by only three points to the world\u2019s two top teams it\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens when we get it right.\u201d Wood makes a fair point. Some of the criticism has been over the top, despite five straight defeats and an unconvincing win over Samoa. Elements of it, however, has been justified. Inconsistent selection, reactive thinking, poor game management, inconsistency ... England\u2019s inability to fulfil their collective potential has been maddening. A heightened sense of national heritage and a positive team culture cannot balance the ledger indefinitely. Until now Lancaster has been able to put much of this away in an increasingly thick file marked \u2018work-ons\u2019. Many of his players were in excellent club form in September and October. By all accounts they also trained well before the New Zealand defeat, since when confidence has slowly ebbed away. Lancaster\u2019s favourite book is The Score Takes Care Of Itself by Bill Walsh, the former San Francisco 49ers coach, in which failure is regarded as a key precursor to a team\u2019s eventual success. But what happens when the scoreboard does not play ball repeatedly? While hanging tough in adversity is crucial, winning World Cups requires something extra. Intricately laid plans are fine but midfield is not the only area in need of fresh momentum. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re just fine-tuning,\u201d says the former England captain Martin Corry, a man with experience of leading his country through lean times. \u201cIt\u2019s been a disappointing series and there\u2019s no sugar-coating that. What I would like to see now is something changing. Something has to happen. It\u2019s not a personnel issue, barring one or two injuries, it\u2019s about individuals showing strong leadership and saying: \u2018I can effect a change here\u2019.\u201d Among other things, Corry believes the management have missed a trick by not playing James Haskell at openside flanker in at least one of the games. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slight on Chris Robshaw, who\u2019s played well, but the combination isn\u2019t working. There\u2019s something missing. You ought to be looking and trying things to find the right combination. What is clear is that there\u2019s Six Nations good and there\u2019s best in the world good.\u201d In that regard, England\u2019s 2011 World Cup captain, Lewis Moody, wonders if a phone call to the south of France might yet be worthwhile. \u201cFor me Steffon Armitage has been the form back-rower in European rugby for the last two years and it\u2019s been tragic we\u2019ve not been able to add him to an England squad,\u201d says the former Leicester and Bath flanker. \u201cTo have one of your best players unavailable for England because he\u2019s playing in another country is a real shame. I totally support the policy, because you don\u2019t want to see an exodus of people abroad, but I\u2019d love him to have the opportunity to see if he\u2019s good enough at international level.\u201d Moody is equally swift to emphasise he is not proposing Robshaw be summarily axed but he reckons Armitage would bring a different dynamic: \u201cHe\u2019d be an asset, without doubt, because he offers something no other back-rower does.\u201d Lancaster does not believe in parachuting outsiders into his tight squad environment but Corry feels more effort should have been made to repatriate Armitage, if only to galvanise others. \u201cIt\u2019s all about mindset and someone grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what they need now. It\u2019s nice playing the fancy, creative heads-up game but sometimes it\u2019s just about winning the collisions, strong carries and getting over the gain line. What disappointed me about the South Africa game was that we had an opportunity to really impose ourselves physically and we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d With New Zealanders continuing to wonder aloud if players such as Billy Vunipola are aerobically fit enough, it explains why the name Sam Burgess is now cropping up. Whether or not Bath\u2019s new cross-code marauder makes an instant splash in union, the view from within the England camp is that his talismanic qualities would bring an edge to training regardless. But does it not say a lot that some are backing Burgess to rampage straight into England\u2019s starting XV as early as this spring? A Bath and England centre of a previous vintage, Simon Halliday, feels it is \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to other candidates even to consider it: \u201cIf Sam Burgess gets into the England team next year it will be nothing short of a miracle. To say he can play in the pivotal position in international rugby when he hasn\u2019t played a full game of union is an insult to other players. \u201cI\u2019ve met Sam and I was really impressed with his persona and modesty but, I\u2019m sorry, I do not subscribe to the idea he can make it in time for the World Cup. If he does we\u2019re probably going to win it because he\u2019ll be playing so well he\u2019ll be unbeatable.\u201d Instead, Halliday believes England simply have to decide on two complementary centres and stick with them, whoever they are. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination that matters and that depends how England think they want to play,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to stop the chopping and the changing. I\u2019m sure Stuart would say exactly the same thing but he hasn\u2019t been dealt good cards.\u201d As Corry also points out, a fit Manu Tuilagi would make a massive difference, not merely for England but for Leicester too. And if England are completely rubbish how did their forwards force the All Blacks into conceding a penalty try and match the Springboks at set pieces? How different, furthermore, will things feel next September when Twickenham is swinging, the chariot is fully revved and the benefits of hosting the World Cup kick in? \u201cBar 1999 and 2007 there\u2019s always been a home side in the World Cup final,\u201d Moody says. \u201cWhen things are going well you can just imagine what the crowd will be like. They\u2019ve got a tough pool but I\u2019d cut my left testicle off to play in a World Cup at home.\u201d By next September, too, players and coaches will be less concerned with external opinion. The growing prickliness in the camp this month has not been entirely Movember-related. In the end, though, everything boils down to results. Beat Australia well and the Wallabies will not waltz back into Twickenham next autumn. Hoist the Six Nations trophy in March and Lancaster will be able to pick Ant and Dec in the centres if he so wishes. \u201cWe\u2019ve lacked continuity and a real understanding of what we\u2019re trying to achieve in the middle of the field,\u201d Wood says. Display such clarity against Australia and it will be a far more restful Christmas for all concerned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
