The president was discussing Sony\u2019s decision to pull Sony\u2019s The Interview on Friday when he conflated the film\u2019s star, Franco, with Flacco to come up with a hybrid creation named \u201cJames Flacco\u201d. \u201cI think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state come out with an all-out attack because of satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco,\u201d said Obama. \u201cI love Seth and I love James, but the notion that that was a threat to them gives you some sense of the kind of regime we are talking about here.\u201d Twitter was quickly filled with Flacco/Franco gags: That only left the actual Joe Flacco to weigh in on the matter. Which he quickly did: Franco and Kim Jong-un are yet to tweet their thoughts on the state of the Ravens secondary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
