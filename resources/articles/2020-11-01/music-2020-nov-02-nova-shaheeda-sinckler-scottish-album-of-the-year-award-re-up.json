But for this year\u2019s winner Shaheeda Sinckler \u2013 AKA Nova \u2013 it\u2019s about more than money: the prize is a vindication of her total self-sufficiency. The rapper is virtually unknown \u2013 she had only around 300 monthly listeners on Spotify prior to her win \u2013 but her coolly confident, lyrically deft debut album Re-Up is a deserving winner, spanning grime, trap, Afrobeats, dubstep and frosty electronica in collaboration with some of Scotland\u2019s fastest-rising producers. It beat far more prominent nominees, including Lewis Capaldi and Anna Meredith, by capturing the spirit of the nation\u2019s underground nightlife, but most importantly it cements Sinckler\u2019s own identity as an artist. \u201cI was listening to the album yesterday and just feeling really proud,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI was reflecting on all the topics I talk about, all that negativity, and how I\u2019ve been able to flip those stories into something so positive. It makes me feel amazing. Like I\u2019m an alchemist.\u201d Throughout Re-Up, Sinckler drops hints that she\u2019s struggled to be taken seriously \u2013 both within the music scene and outside it. On the bleakly emotional Back in the Day, she reflects on moving forwards from complicated relationships, while the ferocious closer Trophy asserts success is the best form of revenge. \u201cYeah, there were people in my personal life,\u201d she says, haltingly, \u201cthat have just not been \u2026 understanding. People that had their own agenda and expected me to do what they say.\u201d Sinckler first got involved in the Scottish rap scene as a teenager, first in Edinburgh and then Glasgow. \u201cStanding in between the electronic and rap scenes I felt like a bit of an outcast at first, like people didn\u2019t understand me straight away,\u201d she says. \u201cOh yeah, and the accent thing!\u201d After moving from London to Edinburgh as a young child, Sinckler has kept her mum\u2019s English accent \u2013 a factor that at first prevented her from feeling fully at home within the local music scene. \u201cFor some people, the accent\u2019s just really important,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see me as a Scottish artist, and I felt a bit confused initially. But now I feel solidified \u2013 or more solidified at least \u2013 in my Scottish identity.\u201d Sinckler raps as Nova, produces tracks as Nova Scotia the Truth, and DJs as DJ Scotia. The sense of a \u201cnew Scotland\u201d that runs through these separate but connected projects is shared by the likes of OH141 and Fuse, an agency run by Sinckler\u2019s manager: a powerful new wave of innovative, inclusive club nights run by and for people of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s just so different now,\u201d says Sinckler. \u201cWhen I started, it was all run by guys, just white guys. Guys who wanted to get drunk and messed up, and it was just not very nice. Very toxic. But now there are all these younger artists that are just so sick; there are women now, some people are non-binary, all these rappers talking about actual emotions. It\u2019s wonderful!\u201d On Bread &amp; Butter, a track that echoes the brassy, bassy charisma of King Krule, Sinckler lays out the unique sensation of getting paid for her passion: \u201cI do it for the bread and butter / and the way my heart quickens.\u201d But she admits that at first, performing in public involved a suspension of disbelief: \u201cI\u2019d be like, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d To watch her now, you\u2019d never know \u2013 her steely composure and articulate, deceptively calm flow convey a sense of complete authority. \u201cYeah, some people say it\u2019s like an alter ego when I rap,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI can be quite shy. But rap lets you represent yourself the way you want to be represented. You can add that little bit of salt and pepper.\u201d Since her debut mixtape in 2019, Nova\u2019s made an art of documenting this changing scene, taking her listeners with her from the stage to the club to the afterparty. But this late-night energy is something she\u2019s now missing. \u201cDuring lockdown I\u2019ve been like: I can\u2019t believe we used to go to clubs? And like, dance? Hug each other? Share cigarettes?\u201d she says, incredulously. Sinckler\u2019s currently locked in her house \u2013 a positive Covid test prevented her from picking up her SAY award in person \u2013 but the prize will allow career expansion. \u201cI didn\u2019t have money or access to professionals. I needed to be self-sufficient,\u201d she says. But now she\u2019s dreaming bigger without losing that sense of control: \u201cI want a whole load of creatives on one project \u2013 makeup artists, stylists, a set designer, a videographer. I can pay people fairly and be like: I\u2019m going top quality, 100%!\u201d That said, her mum thinks she should push even further. \u201cShe\u2019s always telling me to send my tracks to mad people. She\u2019s like, you should send this to Missy Elliott!\u201d Sinckler cracks up. \u201cOh my God, I couldn\u2019t take the embarrassment. But, you never know, maybe she\u2019s right.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
