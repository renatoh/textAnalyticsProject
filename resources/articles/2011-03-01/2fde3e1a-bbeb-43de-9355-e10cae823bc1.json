Her family waved her off and she drove away. Twenty minutes later, she stopped the car, switched off the ignition and wept at the wheel. Then she started the car again, drove to Harwich and took the ferry to Hamburg, from where, coaxing the Mini through deep snow, she arrived in Berlin. She had been appointed a French horn player in the orchestra of the Staatsoper, the opera house of east Berlin, whose chief conductor is now Daniel Barenboim. It was 1991. She was the first westerner, and the first female brass player, to join the orchestra. \"They thought I was a Martian,\" she says now. She has lived in Berlin ever since and is now in her ninth season with the Berlin Philharmonic \u2013 regarded by many as the best orchestra in the world. Willis may have been in the vanguard. But, since the Berlin wall came down, the city has exerted a magnetic pull on British artists, especially those whose work is unconfined by language (though rising film star Sam Riley, who stars in the recent film adaptation of Brighton Rock, is a Berlin resident). Two Turner prize winners, Susan Philipsz and Douglas Gordon, live here, and there are a host of other artists including Ceal Floyer, Jonathan Monk, and Tacita Dean, who has been commissioned to create the next Turbine Hall installation at Tate Modern. Artist Phil Collins, Turner prize-nominated in 2006, is living in the city, making work as well as running a bar with Barry Burns of the Glasgow band Mogwai. Then there are the British musicians: most famously Sir Simon Rattle, music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, who lives in the city with his wife and young children; and a host of composers including Richard Barrett, Rebecca Saunders, Luke Bedford, Naomi Pinnock and Richard Baker. At its most basic, the reason for Berlin's popularity among British artists is the combination of a generously funded cultural infrastructure, the city's rich and fascinating historical texture and, crucially, cheap property. Demonstrators have been smashing Berlin bank windows in recent weeks in protest against gentrification and rising rents; and there is growing disquiet about low-wage, working-class Berliners being forced to the socially problematic, high-rise fringes of the city. But for artists who wish to live and work in a cosmopolitan capital, the cost of living is still a great deal less than in London and, for many, the city is a better, simpler and more inspiring place to live as an artist. Glasgow-born Philipsz came to Berlin in 2001, having been offered a residency at a gallery in the city. \"We were totally broke,\" she said, \"but it was an easy city to be skint in. We just got by. At the time, loads of people were flocking to Berlin; we seemed to be part of something that was developing. There were gallery openings every night; at the time that was important to us, it meant we could get to know people. Socially, it was great. There were loads of artists. Thousands of artists, it seemed.\" These days she has an international career and Berlin is as much a retreat as anything. \"It's a good city to hide in, if you want.\" But she also finds it easy to work here, and the dense history of the place has prompted a number of works, such as her piece Pledge, which charted a journey through Berlin in search of Rosa Luxemburg. Gordon, also Glasgow-born, lived in the city in the 1990s, moved to New York and came back when he fell in love with a Berlin-based soprano he met at the Manchester International festival in 2007. His studio, in Kreuzberg near the line of the old wall, provides part of the answer to why the city might prove attractive. On a scale unimaginable in London, New York or even Glasgow, it combines office, store, editing suite for his film work and a vast studio space the size of a factory floor. In one corner, dwarfed by the room, stands a grand piano on which howls a stuffed wolf surrounded by melted white candle stubs. A nook is occupied by a hammock; a table chequerboarded with the film DVDs Gordon means to watch; a pinboard is covered with photos of actors, casting ideas for a feature film venture. \"After six or seven years in New York, the pace here suits me better,\" he says. \"You can get things done; but there's also no sense of urgency. If you want to get things done quickly you can. If you want to party all night you can too. There's not a sense of massive competition with other artists. It's very supportive, like Glasgow when I was young.\" Like Philipsz, Douglas enjoys the sense of retreat. No gallery represents him in the city (there are plenty of galleries here, but it is not quite a commercial centre for art in the way that New York and London are). In Berlin, he can hide. And then there is the feeling of ease: the gentle pace at which Berlin's inhabitants get round the city by bike; the wide, uncrowded streets. According to Baker, a composer and conductor who divides his time between London and Berlin, \"there is a greater feeling of space in Berlin, and that's very literal \u2013 the cycle paths are navigable, public transport is effective and not overcrowded. The basic conditions of life are easier compared with the feeling of constant struggle in London.\" The city's spacious quality, its feeling of freedom, seems to translate into the practice of its artists. A recent chamber piece by Baker, Gaming, was premiered by members of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London last year. \"Berlin seemed to free me. I just wouldn't have had the balls to have written like that in London,\" he says. For Bedford, a composer currently writing an opera for the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, the city has had a similar effect. The \"shackles have come off\", he says. Neither composer has a \"career\" in Berlin: most of their work is made for British concert platforms. But Bedford says: \"I like going to concerts and not knowing anyone and being an outsider; I enjoy having to discover things for myself. Being in another culture helps you see that London isn't the be-all and end-all.\" There is plenty to discover: because of Berlin's division, its cultural institutions ended up multiplying, so as to serve both halves of the city. That is why it has three opera houses, for example, to serve a population less than half the size of London's. British artists also find that their work, in a country that has historically treated culture with intense seriousness, is valued in Berlin. \"When you say you are a composer it feels really normal in Berlin,\" Bedford says. \"In Britain people often don't seem to think you can actually be a composer; people are rather confused by it and think you must write music for TV, or something.\" Willis agrees: \"Particularly when I came here, musicians were treated almost nobly. It was a high-esteem job.\" Dean says: \"There's a quality of seriousness about being an artist here that is so un-British. If you say you are an artist here, that's a valid thing. In the UK it's laughable \u2013 you are a freak or a radical. In 2000, when I left, you had to be at the sensational end of things, hanging out with pop stars. That wasn't me.\" That seriousness is reflected in high levels of state support for arts: the Berlin Philharmonic players are paid generously and treated well. \"Psychologically, the place of the arts is very, very powerful here. It's without question that they should be supported, even in a cash-strapped city. They really do their level best to look after the arts,\" says Rattle. \"There are British orchestras where you get up at 4am, get a flight, rehearse and do a concert that night,\" Willis says. \"We get put up in nice hotels and have travel days set aside. British orchestras are full of incredible musicians, but is it any wonder they can sometimes seem tired?\" Baker says: \"London seems to get more and more like Manhattan in terms of its inequality. As an artist, one can sometimes feel that one exists to provide entertainment to the wealthy: you are simply a skilled servant. In Berlin, as someone making art, you have some kind of status.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
