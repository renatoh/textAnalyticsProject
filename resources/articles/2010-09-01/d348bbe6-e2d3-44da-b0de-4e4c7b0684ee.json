Only one side resembled a hard-nosed Premiership team and it was not the butter-fingered bunch in cherry and white. For Exeter, in contrast, this was the most spectacular of ram-raids. It was a significant moment for the Premiership, too, the result and fervid atmosphere re-emphasising the huge potential out in the untapped wild west. At times it felt like watching Munster in the early days at the old Thomond Park, both in terms of on-field commitment and the supporters' gleeful relish. Woe betide any sore-headed Chief, nevertheless, who reports for work this morning assuming top\u2011flight rugby is a doddle. The head coach, Rob Baxter, likes the occasional glass of cider but knows better than to count his apples prematurely: \"If any of the guys had suggested doing a lap of honour I'd have been chucking them in the changing rooms myself. The danger is that we party and celebrate something that we don't see again for a while. That wasn't a cup final. We're not going to celebrate until we know we're here again next year.\" The task of keeping his players' feet on the ground has at least been simplified by this weekend's fixture list. Leicester at Welford Road concentrates the mind and Tommy Hayes, Exeter's captain and brother of the veteran Irish prop John, suggests judgment should be reserved until Saturday night. \"I don't think we can afford to spend the week recovering from drink and then go to Welford Road. This can't just be an emotional high, we have to become a ruthless rugby team as well. It's going to be hard but we've set out trying not to be afraid of playing in the Premiership.\" Interestingly, Munster and Leicester are the teams Baxter would like Exeter to try to emulate. \"Their supporters have a real connection with the team and that's something we want to try to build here,\" Hayes said. The truth, though, is that a trip to Exeter already has its unique flavour. The maximum-width pitch seemed to disorientate Gloucester and the stiff breeze blowing up the Exe estuary will fool many visiting kickers, the stadium having already earned the nickname \"Windy Park\". Five times Nicky Robinson aimed for the posts and five times he did not register a point, despite striking the woodwork twice. His opposite number Gareth Steenson used his local meteorological knowledge to kick four faultless penalties, plus a conversion and a smart drop-goal. \"He's as reliable as you'd get,\" Hayes said. \"When I point at the sticks you're near enough sure the scoreboard is going to tick on.\" Not all opponents, mind you, will play into Exeter's hands as consistently as Gloucester did, with the notable exception of James Simpson-Daniel. Robinson's misses were compounded by a litany of forward passes, primarily the fault of the catcher rather than the thrower. The referee Rob Debney spotted half a dozen but at least three other glaring basketball-style examples went unpunished. The Chiefs, propelled by their outstanding back-row of James Scaysbrook, Tom Johnson and James Phillips, took steady advantage as the haunting strains of the Tomahawk Chop swirled around their ears. Exeter could easily have registered more than just a fifth-minute try by Mark Foster and have a raft of fresh signings still itching for a chance. Their next home game, with Newcastle on Saturday week, already looks a genuine test for the Falcons, with Exeter revealed to be far more than just forward-dominated scrappers. \"It's no secret our maul was a good weapon for us last year but going through a Premiership season just kicking and mauling is not necessarily possible,\" Hayes said. The smoke signals point to a side worth watching. \"Everyone performed out of their skins but we're going to have to do that every week if we're going to be competitive,\" Steenson said. \"We want to make Sandy Park a fortress ... it's going to be even tougher for [visiting] kickers when winter comes round.\" Exeter, as their chief executive, Tony Rowe, promised on this site on Saturday, are strapped in for the long haul.
