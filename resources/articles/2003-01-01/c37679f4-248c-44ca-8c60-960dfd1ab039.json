After draws with Chelsea and Liverpool, as well as a defeat at Old Trafford, they are yet to beat any of their principal rivals. Arsenal will surely run into trouble if they do not recover their best form, and their need for improved sharpness in attack could see Francis Jeffers or Dennis Bergkamp start. The visitors fell to their first defeat in 12 Premiership matches at Leeds on Saturday, moving Claudio Ranieri to talk of the modest ambition of improving on last team's points total. Such mildness will not be apparent in this London derby.

John Gregory left and Graham Taylor has yet to prove a messiah on his second coming. His chances are not being improved by a casualty list approaching double figures but the ill wind is blowing Villa some good. Taylor has been forced to turn to some of the club's promising youngsters, not least 16-year-old striker Luke Moore. Bolton have relatively few absentees but will be forced to make a change in defence where Ivan Campo, who has been collecting cautions with wild abandon, is suspended.

After their wins, Bolton, Leeds and Manchester City all saw their league form suffer and these two sides, which both claimed three points off Sir Alex Ferguson's team over the festive period, have not won since. It is a familiar failing, but both clubs will be keen to rediscover their league form this afternoon if they are to push for a Uefa Cup spot.

Three of those games are at Upton Park, where Glenn Roeder's team have not won this season. West Ham's away form has tended to be decent and they are more than capable of winning here if Charlton perform as against West Brom on Saturday. Alan Curbishley's team still won that match despite a low-quality display and are unbeaten in eight.

A particularly notable day for Richard Dunne, who has recovered from the brink of unemployment to excel of late, and returns to Goodison Park intent on completing a league double over his former employers.

West Brom have no such illusions but beat Fulham earlier this season at the Hawthorns and, like their hosts, will be desperate to take something from today's game. \"It's a very, very, very important game for the club,\" said Jean Tigana, urging his side to emulate West Brom's increasingly fabled commitment. \"Sadly, that is not always enough at this level,\" says Gary Megson.

Robbie Savage sounded a warning: \"If we stay with the squad we've got, we'll be relegated. We need players coming in.\" They certainly need central defenders right now. Four are injured, Darren Purse suspended and only Michael Johnson available. Victory would take them above Leeds but it would have looked more likely three weeks ago: Leeds have picked up 10 points from their last four matches. City will be glad of a point.

Keane was sent off at Sunderland in August for elbowing Jason McAteer, but with the latter injured it is doubtful there will be a repeat.

Owen, 13 goals in his last nine games against Newcastle, has a tight hamstring. Milan Baros should lead the line against as Liverpool try to halt their run of 10 games without a win. Another Newcastle victory would be the ninth in a row at home and would leave them four points above Liverpool with a game in hand.

The Tottenham manager left Southampton in March 2001, and while the acrimonious nature of his departure still rankles it is fair to say that Southampton have recovered under Gordon Strachan. On his only other trip back south Hoddle's side lost 1-0, but whichever team comes out on top, a crucial psychological advantage can be gained before they meet again in the FA Cup on Saturday.
