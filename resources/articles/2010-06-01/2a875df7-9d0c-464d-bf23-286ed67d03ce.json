That didn't work out, but since then Bert van Marwijk has been building on the positives (crushing wins against Italy, France and Romania) and learning from the setbacks. He's a pragmatic coach who understands that style sometimes has to be sacrificed \u2013 a long way from the mantra of Johan Cruyff and co. The return of Mark van Bommel has added some occasionally illegal, but always required, steel and grit, and the defence was watertight in qualifying. There's no easy route once past the group stage though. I'd expect a quarter-final defeat. Men to watch: Attacking options abound: Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben (hamstring allowing), Rafael van der Vaart, Robin van Persie and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. And breaking through at just the right time are two superb young attackers: Eljero Elia and Ibrahim Afellay. Weakest link: The defence is of less concern than normal, but the keeper is the worry. The current cream of the crop, Maarten Stekelenburg, is more of a boring Edam than a really good quality Gouda. There are no viable alternatives. The coach: Bert is no glory seeker. His goal is to organise the firepower and keep the peace between the superstars in the squad and the less well-paid. Best chant: \"Hup Holland\" (\"Go Holland\"). Least-liked opponents: Germany and Portugal. TIPS Winner: Spain \u2013 full of top-class players. Golden boot: David Villa (Spain). England: They won't struggle in the group stage, but will lose in the quarter-finals. England lack depth of talent, and endeavour and sweat aren't enough. The best to be hoped for is a dignified defeat. Follow Michael de Vries at goodsportblog.wordpress.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
