Oddly, the answer is that it radically improves his life, boosts his self-confidence and creates a social media hero. Since Louis Gill, a former English language teacher from Oxford, appeared on Channel 4\u2019s First Dates a week ago, the 26-year-old has been hailed as a modern model of gentlemanly behaviour and self-effacing charm, despite nerves often preventing him from speaking. When his date, Adela, told him she was from Manchester, a stuttering Gill replied: \u201cI fell asleep on the train once and woke up in Manchester.\u201d A long silence followed. It made for unsettling television. Yet this weekend, after appearing for a second time and featuring in a series of blogs, radio shows, articles and thousands of tweets, Gill has judged the experience a huge help. \u201cAbsolutely no doubt about it. It has done wonders,\u201d said Gill. \u201cHaving these dates on the show made me explore my own issues of self-confidence. The questions I was asked were quite penetrating, and I now feel there are a lot of things I don\u2019t need to worry about any more.\u201d A popular TV show like First Dates, in its fourth series and set in a restaurant rigged with cameras and microphones, is a magnet for exhibitionists, so the strong national reaction to Gill is probably down to his refreshingly painful reticence. The Twitter hashtags GoLouis and TeamLouis ran wild last week, alongside the programme\u2019s own account. \u201cWho else wants to start a campaign to find Louis love?\u201d asked @LadyRaaRaa, while @lauralizmorris noted: \u201cI\u2019m more invested in Louis\u2019 love life than my own.\u201d After Gill\u2019s second outing on Thursday @cubbin10 praised his chivalry: \u201cI reckon Louis is that much of a gentleman he\u2019d pay the bill, pay for her taxi fare and then her Uni tuition fees.\u201d During his uncomfortable date with Adela, Gill broke a cardinal rule of dating by mentioning politics (he is a confirmed LibDemmer). Several members of the Channel 4 audience responded by calling for him to be offered the highest office in the land. \u201cI am sorry I brought politics up, because people don\u2019t like talking about it, let alone for a television audience,\u201d he said. \u201cBut actually I am now looking for work in politics and in the future I would quite like to stand for election.\u201d Although shy, Gill put himself forward for First Dates after spotting an advertisement last year. He thought: \u201cI do want to meet someone and you never know.\u201d He recognises this urge to appear in public is a contradiction. \u201cI have tried hard to explain it to myself,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some level I am willing to put myself out there.\u201d This weekend strangers have approached Gill in the street to congratulate him on holding it together on his latest first date with a woman called Lydia, although at one point he had to retire to the toilets to breathe slowly. \u201cThe public reaction has been touching and overwhelming,\u201d he said. Particularly moving was a blog written by a woman who suffers from anxiety. \u201cIt was amazing because she said what a difference it had made to her to see someone experience the same thing.\u201d Like all new celebrities, Gill has faced some flak. \u201cThere have been a few spiteful comments, mainly about me being a toff,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI object to people assuming I am a Bullingdon Club klutz, because actually I have a mixed European background. My family came here from Ireland, Poland and Italy and so, as my mother says, that means we have gone from \u2018migrants\u2019 to \u2018toffs\u2019 in two generations, which is possibly going up the derogatory scale.\u201d He attended a mixed private school in Oxford and has an interest in Russia. He has had two serious girlfriends and is still single, despite a recent \u201choliday romance\u201d with a Dutch girl during a walking tour of Krakow. \u201cI am in touch with both Lydia and Adela, but on a friendly basis. I am very grateful to them, because they were both lovely women. It is an extraordinary environment on the show, but once you sit down you are not aware of the cameras.\u201d Gill would like to get married and has an open mind about what he is looking for. \u201cFriendship and doing things you enjoy together is important. The idea of a romantic partner is often objectified now, I think, almost as if it was an acquisition, like a new car,\u201d he said. Living up to the label of \u201cultimate gentleman\u201d is a burden, Gill knows. \u201cA social media slip could become a very negative thing for me, but the whole thing has actually made me kinder in general. It just confuses me why people choose to be unpleasant to each other,\u201d he said. First Dates is keen for Louis to return to the show\u2019s restaurant to try his luck again and last month he was preparing for another date, courtesy of Channel 4, when the lady concerned dropped out. \u201cI would be persuadable,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to become a regular there, saying to the waitresses, \u2018Same again, please!\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
