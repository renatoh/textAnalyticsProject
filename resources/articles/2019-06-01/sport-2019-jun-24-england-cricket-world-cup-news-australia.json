Speaking before Tuesday\u2019s World Cup group game between England and Australia \u2013 which Jason Roy will miss with a hamstring injury \u2013 Morgan was asked if he would follow India\u2019s Virat Kohli and Justin Langer, the Australia head coach, by requesting that fans go easy on Smith and Warner. But despite 15 months having passed since the Cape Town incident that led to the Australian batsmen being stood down from leadership roles, suspended from international cricket for a year and the subject of widespread public criticism, Morgan believes it is not in his remit as England captain to issue orders to fans. \u201cI would never use the position I\u2019m in to influence fans or try to change the game in some way,\u201d Morgan told BBC Sport. \u201c[Smith and Warner] have committed something and they have served their penalty. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are welcomed back with open arms into the cricket community. Regaining trust takes a lot of time. \u201cWho knows how long it will take? I don\u2019t think I could do anything, or should so anything, to try influence the fans to change their mind.\u201d Morgan admitted Kohli\u2019s much-praised intervention during India\u2019s win over Australia a fortnight ago, in which he asked fans to clap Smith, prompted him to consider a repeat, only to decide on reflection that \u201cit didn\u2019t sit right with me\u201d. Jonny Bairstow, who struck up a friendship with Warner during this year\u2019s Indian Premier League, used his Daily Telegraph column to allude to double standards on the issue, chiefly that Darren Lehmann, the former Australia coach, urged home fans to make Stuart Broad \u201ccry\u201d during the 2013-14 Ashes trip. While England have already faced the pair during a warm-up match in Southampton, Lord\u2019s is the first meeting in an international. The stewards have been briefed to be on the lookout should any booing directed at Smith and Warner turn into personal abuse; if so, it may violate ticketing terms and result in any offender being ejected. The Australia captain, Aaron Finch, who has heard booing directed at the pair throughout their time in England, said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t affected our boys one bit. I can honestly say that, if anything, it\u2019s given them a bit more motivation. \u201cIf a handful of people or a whole stadium are booing them, it doesn\u2019t make any difference to how hard they watch the ball or whether they doubt themselves or anything like that. I think it\u2019s a bit of white noise, to be fair.\u201d Warner has certainly appeared unaffected, scoring 447 runs in six innings, including two centuries. The 32-year-old has been more watchful in doing so but Morgan said if he does switch to his more typical aggression, England\u2019s bowlers have plans. Morgan is once again without one of his own incendiary openers. Roy had a fresh scan on his hamstring tear on Monday morning but despite netting afterwards, Sunday\u2019s meeting with India at Edgbaston is now the revised goal. The injury gave rise to talk of whether Alex Hales, who was \u201cde-selected\u201d from the World Cup due to a recreational drug ban, could return. Morgan is unable to state on the record that the right-hander is now ineligible but said, after speaking to the national selector Ed Smith, that the pecking order of replacements remains the same. This probably means Joe Denly and Dawid Malan, who featured before the tournament, are next in line. In Roy\u2019s absence, James Vince once again gets the chance to prove his obvious talent can translate into an innings of substance; from 12 ODI caps to date, the stylish right-hander has only one half-century. Vince is the junior member of a batting lineup that is looking to make amends following Friday\u2019s collapse to 212 all out against Sri Lanka in Leeds, a 20-run defeat that increases the pressure as they look to secure a semi-final spot. \u201cGuys have performed under pressure for a very long time,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cThey have performed under the pressure of being favourites for the last two years in series, both away from home and at home, and I have no question mark about producing under pressure.\u201d Finch added: \u201cWe are expecting England to come out ultra-hard and take the game on, which has been one of their main traits over the last couple of years. I think the pressure is increasing on everyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
