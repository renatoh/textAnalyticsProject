Financial fair play was introduced in 2009 by Uefa as an attempt to curb excessive spending and to encourage clubs to pay out relative to what they earn, but Wenger suggests the regulations are more or less meaningless. \u201cIt has gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen the signs coming from Uefa for a while. I thought it would happen but now it is not possible. What\u2019s happened is the clubs threatened to go to civil court \u2013 not only through sport. That brought a lot of insecurity in the decision-making of Uefa so they started to soften the rules a little bit.\u201d Although the most high-profile cases punished Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, who were fined, with squad size restrictions and spending limits also imposed in February 2014, the number of legal challenges by clubs in effect saw off the FFP concept. Uefa has backtracked to the point that it is no longer viable. For a number of years, Arsenal\u2019s business plan was based on their hopes that FFP would level the financial playing field. That is no longer a realistic aspiration. Where does that leave Arsenal? \u201cExactly the same,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe continue to run our business with the resources we create. They [other clubs] can put a hundred or two hundred on top. It is always like that. Maybe it will change one day.\u201d The only way that will change is if Arsenal\u2019s ownership model changes. Stan Kroenke, the billionaire majority shareholder, has never shown any desire to fund the club personally and he is a believer in a self-sustaining business model. That said, Wenger stressed that the problems that have crushed FFP are not the reason for Arsenal\u2019s relative inactivity in this transfer window, with Petr Cech the only major arrival. There is a healthy pot of money \u2013 albeit not as deep as, say, Manchester City\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve said to you all the time it is not a shortage of money,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cAt the moment it is a handicap to us because we have the resources, just shortage of players.\u201d A year ago Arsenal were busier in the summer window, spending in excess of \u00a375m to recruit Alexis S\u00e1nchez, David Ospina, Mathieu Debuchy, Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers. S\u00e1nchez has been the standout success story. Ospina made some solid performances last season but has been superseded by Cech. Welbeck and Debuchy were unlucky with injuries. The jury remains out on Chambers, who arrived as a young prospect and showed strong potential initially. But last Monday he endured a very difficult and nervy game against Liverpool. Wenger has spoken to the 20-year-old, retains great faith in him and has no hesitation in picking him against Newcastle at St James\u2019s Park on Saturday if Arsenal\u2019s first-choice defensive pair of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny are not fit. \u201cHe showed character,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe positive of the night, though he did not have the best performance in the first half, was the way he recovered. He showed his mental strength. He has lost a bit of confidence compared to last year. Maybe not playing too much \u2013 the Under-21 tournament did not help him as he did not play at all. \u201cI have spoken to him and he\u2019s a strong footballer, a dedicated player who is ready to work day and night. He has the talent to be a good player.\u201d Although naturally frustrated by the frailties Arsenal have shown so far, especially after how much he pressed the case for a strong start, Wenger feels his team are closer to the level required. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s normal that after two or three games you are not completely at 100%. We are there now. Three or four games, that\u2019s what you need.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
