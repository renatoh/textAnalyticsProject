Former senate majority leader Harry Reid changes his stance on an impeachment inquiry, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not the right thing to do nothing\u201d. A second woman in less than 36 hours dies after crossing the border, according to US Border Control. On Saturday, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker from El Salvador, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas. The House of Representatives will vote on 11 June on whether to hold both attorney general William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress. House judiciary chair Jerry Nadler does not appear to be willing to delay a minute longer. Following the Virginia Beach shooting in which 12 people were killed in a a city municipal building, governor Ralph Northam announced that he will summon lawmakers back to the state Capitol this summer on the issue of gun-control legislation, the Associated Press is reporting: Northam, a Democrat faced with a gun-friendly, Republican-controlled General Assembly in the middle of a legislative election year, also said he wants every lawmaker to go on record for or against his proposals during the special session, rather than avoid tough votes by quietly killing the bills in subcommittee. \u201cThe nation will be watching,\u201d the governor said, four days after Virginia Beach employee DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building. Craddock was then killed in a gunbattle with police. Northam\u2019s bills include a ban on silencers and high-capacity magazines, as well as a broadening of the ability of local governments to prohibit guns in city buildings. The governor said he also wants mandatory, universal background checks before gun purchases; a limit of one handgun purchase per month; and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow authorities to seize weapons from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. \u201cI will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers,\u201d he said, mocking the usual response to gun violence by supporters of the gun lobby. David Smith was in Virginia Beach this weekend, writing about the shooting.

Reid, who as recently as last month was cautioning against pursuing impeachment, said he would likely reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the issue. \u201cThat has been one of the big arguments against the impeachment,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWhy make Trump a hero by saying \u2018they couldn\u2019t impeach me?\u2019\u201d And remove him from office. But Reid called that \u201call the more reason why the inquiry is the right thing to do.\u201d In the end, he said, \u201cI just think that Republicans are going arm-in-arm with Trump, right over the cliff.\u201d But he said public opinion might be affected by a systematic effort to explore allegations that Trump tried to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation and engaged in other wrongdoing. \u201cI think that that\u2019s one reason an inquiry should go forward, to find out how the public reacts to this,\u201d he said. A 40-year old Honduran woman died in custody of US Border Control agents, the second person in less than 36 hours to die after crossing the border, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Agents detained the woman in Eagle Pass, Texas at 6:20 a.m. Monday, and collapsed minutes later, after arriving at Eagle Pass South Station. She was transported to a hospital, where she died. \u201cOn behalf of the men and women of CBP, we extend our deepest condolences to those who are just learning of the death of their loved one,\u201d Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThis tragedy marks the second time in less than 36 hours that a person has died immediately following their perilous migration from their home in Central America, through Mexico and across our Southwest border.\u201d Authorities are not identifying the woman until her family is notified. On Saturday, Johana Medina Le\u00f3n, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker from El Salvador, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, after she was detained for over a month and complained of chest pains, officials said. Sam Levin reported on Johana Medina Le\u00f3n, and how her death echoed another in US custody that took place a year before.

CNBC is reporting that Amazon paid a lobbying firm run by an ally of President Trump to push against vendors selling counterfeit goods - an issue that has come under scrutiny in the US-China trade battle. From July 2018 until March 2019, Amazon has been paying Ballard Partners up to $70,000 each quarter for, in part, lobbying on issues related to \u201ctrade and tariff policy,\u201d according to three disclosure reports. However, people familiar with the matter said that the disclosure reports only tell part of the story. Brian Ballard, a leading fundraiser in Florida for Trump during the 2016 presidential election, has been lobbying members of Trump\u2019s administration and Congress on Amazon\u2019s behalf to fight back against third party vendors who are selling fake products to their customers. They\u2019re trying to \u201cstop third party actors from shipping fake Nikes to the United States under the guise that they\u2019re real products,\u201d said a person familiar with their efforts. Amazon is increasingly concerned about fake and pirated products on its marketplace. In a February warning to investors, the company used the word \u201ccounterfeit\u201d for the first time. One month after the firm\u2019s last recorded effort, Trump signed a memorandum to curb the sale of counterfeit items online. Read more here. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Erin Durkin. Hope everyone is having a fine day. Donald Trump met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and held a joint press conference with her on his visit to the UK - encouraging her to \u201cstick around\u201d instead of resigning as planned, expressing support for Brexit, and ripping his British critics. The White House directed former staffers Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson to defy a Congressional subpoena and refuse to turn over documents. Hicks, however, agreed to turn over documents related to her time on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, but not her time at the White House. Joe Biden, after releasing a climate change plan, was called out for passages of it being lifted from other sources. The Trump administration slapped strict new travel restrictions on Cuba, prohibiting educational and cultural tours that many Americans had used to travel legally to the country. They also banned visits to Cuba by cruise ship. Vanity Fair got its hands on Donald Trump\u2019s pre-nuptial agreement with ex-wife Marla Maples. Among the revelations: Trump agreed to pay Maples only $1 million if they separated within five years, plus another $1 million to buy a house. Trump also would stop making $100,000 child support payments for [daughter] Tiffany when she turned 21. The agreement states that Trump\u2019s payments would cease earlier if Tiffany got a full-time job, enlisted in the military, or joined the Peace Corps. They ended up separating after four years. House Democrats are proposing a $4,500 pay hike for members of Congress, Politico reports. House and Senate members have made $174,000 a year since 2009. A Donald Trump supporter stabbed the Trump baby balloon flown by protesters in London, and was arrested. The balloon apparently suffered only minor wounds. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says Paul Manafort \u201cis going to be treated\u2014 as much as humanly possible\u2014 like any other inmate,\u201d the New York Times reports. Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, is reportedly set to be moved to New York\u2019s Rikers Island ahead of his trial on state fraud charges. Business Insider reports that Joe Biden\u2019s climate change plan appears to have lifted multiple sentences directly from outside sources. The campaign says citations were left out inadvertently. Biden has been dogged with plagiarism accusations before, which helped derail his first presidential campaign back in 1988. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff called Attorney General William Barr the \u201csecond most dangerous man in the country.\u201d \u201cWe find ourselves, I think, for the first time with an attorney general who really is the president\u2019s defense lawyer and spokesperson who\u2019s quite good at it and has the veneer of respectability to camouflage what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Schiff said Tuesday at a Council on Foreign Relations event, the Hill reported. \u201cHe is not the sophist that [presidential lawyer Rudy] Giuliani is, he\u2019s much more dangerous, and I think he\u2019s the second-most-dangerous man in the country,\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden is asking bundlers to raise up to $100,000 to become members of his national finance committee, CNBC reports. The four tiers of fundraisers list on an invite obtained by the network: The \u201cAdvocate\u201d group requires members to raise $25,000 by June 30. The \u201cProtector\u201d group is required to bring in $50,000 in 2019. A \u201cUnifier\u201d must rake in $100,000 this year. A \u201cPower Raiser\u201d must acquire 10 unique contributions of $100 or more each month. Each of these donations \u201cmust be from a different, new-to-you donor,\u201d according to the invitation. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said there is \u201cnot much support\u201d among Republicans for the tariffs Donald Trump has announced against Mexico, the New York Times reports. Donald Trump may be preparing to declare another national emergency in order to impose his threatened tariffs on Mexico. Senator Tim Scott told CNN that was the plan after administration officials briefed Republican senators at a lunch Tuesday. Previously, Trump declared a national emergency to get money for a border wall, and then vetoed legislation passed by both the House and Senate that would have stopped him. White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee explaining the White House order to ex-staffers Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to turn over subpoenaed documents, CNN reports. Rep. Jamie Raskin said the refusal adds more fuel for impeachment. Senator Bernie Sanders is weighing in on BuzzFeed\u2019s reluctance to recognize its employees\u2019 union. Donald Trump tweets about Monday\u2019s ruling rejecting a Congressional attempt to block him from using an emergency declaration to spend money to build a border wall without lawmakers\u2019 approval. Piers Morgan is teasing an interview with Donald Trump that will air tomorrow morning, saying it got \u201cfeisty\u201d and people including the Queen and the family of John McCain should tune in. Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee sent a letter to Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez urging him to hold a debate focused on the climate crisis, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThe Democratic Party\u2019s response to climate change cannot only be a few quick questions in the first debates where, in 60 seconds, candidates merely agree that this issue is important, and move on,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need a full debate to really wrestle with who has the best plans to defeat this existential crisis, who has demonstrated the commitment it will take to get this job done, and who understands the scale of ambition necessary to see this mission through to completion.\u201d New York\u2019s state assembly plans to pass a bill to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver\u2019s licenses, NY1 reports. Senator Mitt Romney predicts threatened tariffs on Mexican imports will never be carried out, per HuffPost. The UN deputy high commissioner for human rights called the abortion bans passing in states around the US \u201ctorture\u201d and a form of \u201cgender-based violence against women.\u201d \u201cWe have not called it out in the same way we have other forms of extremist hate, but this is gender-based violence against women, no question,\u201d Kate Gilmore told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s torture \u2013 it\u2019s a deprivation of a right to health,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a crisis. It\u2019s a crisis directed at women.\u201d Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said there must be a \u201cvast reduction\u201d in immigrants crossing the border before the US will back off threatened tariffs on Mexican goods. \u201cThe president was very clear, he wants to see a vast reductions in crossings through Mexico. He believes Mexico can do more to address this flow from Central America. That\u2019s the number one metric that we\u2019re looking for,\u201d he told the Hill. Brexit leader Nigel Farage was seen leaving the London residence where Donald Trump is staying, per a pool report. Farage says he had a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with Trump. House majority leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday that Congress should subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if necessary to get him to testify. \u201cI think he ought to testify. He may want a subpoena, for all I know,\u201d Hoyer said, the Hill reported. \u201cHe indicated that his report speaks for itself. Very frankly, ... questioning is an important fact-finding pursuit.\u201d Mueller has said his report on Russian election interference speaks for itself and he would prefer not to testify. Senator Mitt Romney gave his first speech on the Senate floor, defending the international alliances that have come under attack by Donald Trump. \u201cAlliances are absolutely essential to America\u2019s security, to our future, I can\u2019t state that more plainly,\u201d Romney said, the Hill reported. \u201cWe need to hold our friends closer not neglect them or drive them away.\u201d He argued such alliances are key to countering China, since the US has \u201cmany friends\u201d but \u201cChina has very few.\u201d Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Mark Morgan said Congress has \u201cabsolutely failed\u201d to stop immigrants from crossing the US border, Politico reports. He pushed Congress to change laws to allow families to be detained longer and permit the rapid deportation of unaccompanied minors. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable and nobody should want this,\u201d he said. After the White House instructed former staffers Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to comply with subpoenas, House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler said: \u201cAs part of President Trump\u2019s continued obstruction of Congress, the White House has instructed both Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to turn over records in response to subpoenas issued by our committee last month. I note that Ms Hicks has agreed to turn over some documents to the committee related to her time working for the Trump campaign, and I thank her for that show of good faith. \u201cFederal law makes clear that the documents we requested \u2013 documents that left the White House months ago \u2013 are no longer covered by executive privilege, if they ever were. \u201cThe president has no lawful basis for preventing these witnesses from complying with our request. We will continue to seek reasonable accommodation on these and all our discovery requests and intend to press these issues when we obtain the testimony of both Ms Hicks and Ms Donaldson.\u201d The White House has directed former communications director Hope Hicks to refuse to turn over documents to the House Judiciary Committee in response to a subpoena, CNN reports. Today is the deadline for her and former White House lawyer Annie Donaldson to comply with the subpoena. More from Guardian environment reporter Oliver Milman on the climate change plan released by Joe Biden this morning: The former vice president, current frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said he would spur investment in a \u201cclean energy revolution\u201d that would ensure the US reaches 100% renewable energy and net zero emissions by 2050. Biden\u2019s plan would reestablish much of the Obama administration\u2019s work on climate, such as remaining in the Paris climate accords and setting stricter limits on pollution from cars, trucks and drilling operations. Biden said he would not take donations from the fossil fuel industry. \u201cOn day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track,\u201d Biden\u2019s plan states. Climate breakdown has become a top tier concern for Democratic voters and Biden\u2019s plan appears to have won over some previous critics who claimed the vice president wasn\u2019t ambitious enough to address the crisis. \u201cLast month, we put the national spotlight on Joe Biden\u2019s advisers talking about a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d climate plan that included more fossil fuel development,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise, a grassroots climate group. \u201cThe pressure worked. We forced them to backtrack and today, he put out a comprehensive climate plan that cites the Green New Deal and names climate change as the greatest challenge facing America and the world.\u201d There\u2019s been some surprise at the news that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort will likely be transferred to New York\u2019s Rikers Island jail. The jail complex is notorious for violence and abuse of detainees, and officials have announced plans to close it and replace it with smaller jails around the city. It is home almost exclusively to pre-trial detainees - which would include Manafort, who has been charged by the Manhattan district attorney with six state-level felonies. Manafort has also been convicted, twice, of federal crimes, and sentenced to federal prison. He\u2019s been serving that sentence in Pennsylvania, but is likely to be transferred to New York to be arraigned on the new charges. He\u2019ll likely be held in solitary confinement, and a law enforcement official told the New York Times he would probably be housed in a former prison hospital on the island, where most high-profile detainees are locked up. A New York public defender said liberals should not be celebrating: Senator Elizabeth Warren released a proposal Tuesday calling for a Cabinet-level Department of Economic Development and $2 trillion in green investment. The proposal is centered on the idea of \u201ceconomic patriotism,\u201d which she describes as \u201ca strategy for using all the tools of government to defend and create American jobs rather than continuing to cater to the interests of Wall Street and multinational corporations with no allegiance to America.\u201d China is going after Mike Pompeo for his remarks commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, as well as ongoing political repression in China. In a statement on its website, the Chinese embassy said the secretary of state spoke \u201cout of prejudice and arrogance\u201d and claimed falsely that his condemnation of human rights abuses is a violation of international law. \u201cWhoever attempt to patronize and bully the Chinese people in any name, or preach a \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 to resist the trend of times will never succeed. They will only end up in the ash heap of history,\u201d the embassy said. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang went further at a press briefing Tuesday and said, \u201cThese lunatic ravings and babbling nonsense will only end up in the trash can of history,\u201d Channel News Asia reports. The new Trump administration restrictions on travel to Cuba ban many educational and recreational trips, the Associated Press reports. The treasury department said in a statement that the US will no longer allow the group educational and cultural trips known as \u201cpeople to people\u201d travel to the island. Those trips have been used by thousands of American citizens to visit Cuba legally. The department also said it will deny permission for private and corporate aircraft and boats to travel to Cuba. Former Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort is likely to be moved as early as this week to the Rikers Island jail in New York City, Fox News first reported. He will most likely be held in solitary confinement while facing state fraud charges. He\u2019s now in a Pennsylvania prison after being convicted of federal charges in two related cases. Donald Trump claimed that protests against him in London were fake news. They are, of course, in fact real. Tariffs on Mexican goods will most likely take effect next week as scheduled, Donald Trump said Tuesday. \u201cMexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country,\u201d Trump said during his trip to the UK. Trump has said tariffs will start at 5% and escalate over time. He said of migration into the US, \u201cThey could stop it very quickly, and I think they will, and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to put tariffs on.\u201d He predicted Republicans would not follow through with threatened action to block the tariffs. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will do that. I think if they do, it\u2019s foolish,\u201d he said. Donald Trump said on Brexit that Theresa May is probably a better negotiator than he is. \u201cI would have sued, but that\u2019s OK. She\u2019s probably a better negotiator than I am,\u201d he said of his past suggestion that May sue the EU. \u201cI would have sued and settled maybe, but you never know.\u201d Trump said the UK should go ahead with its scheduled exit from the European Union. \u201cIt will happen, and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country, and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs,\u201d Trump said at his joint press conference with May. The Trump administration has imposed major new restrictions on travel to Cuba, the Associated Press reports. Donald Trump renewed his attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan. \u201cHe\u2019s been a not very good mayor, from what I understand. He\u2019s done a poor job,\u201d Trump said at his London press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, saying Khan should not be criticizing him. \u201cHe\u2019s a negative force, not a positive force,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe hurts the people of this great country.\u201d As for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who spoke at a protest against him, Trump said he has never met Corbyn and declined the chance to meet him on this trip. He called him \u201csomewhat of a negative force.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done,\u201d Trump said. He went on to dismiss protests against him as a \u201cvery very small group of people.\u201d May, asked directly if she agrees with Trump that the mayor is a \u201cstone cold loser,\u201d did not answer but said both Khan and Corbyn should focus on the importance of the US-UK relationship. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, will recall lawmakers to the state Capitol in coming weeks to take up a package of gun-control legislation he said is urgently needed to prevent killings like Friday\u2019s mass shooting in Virginia Beach. The Associated Press reports: Northam, a Democrat, told The Associated Press ahead of his Tuesday announcement that he plans to convene a special legislative session later this summer. He said in an interview that he wants the Republican-controlled General Assembly to hear from the public about the need for \u201ccommon-sense\u201d law related to guns and accessories. Republicans have previously rejected Northam\u2019s gun control bills out of hand, but a top GOP lawmaker signaled Monday that he\u2019s open to a legislative debate. Donald Trump and Theresa May are beginning their press conference after meeting for talks in London. They were greeted with boos from the crowd as they left the prime minister\u2019s residence at Downing Street, where they met privately, to the nearby Foreign Office where they are holding the press conference. Follow it here: Congressional Republicans do not like Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on Mexican goods but have no clear plan to stop it, CNN reports. Senate Republicans are set to meet Tuesday for a weekly policy lunch, where White House officials will defend the tariff plan. More tidbits from Tuesday\u2019s CNN poll: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has the worst net favorability rating among candidates with high name recognition. 19% of voters view him favorably and 22% unfavorably, for a net negative three point rating. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet has qualified for the Democratic presidential debates. The CNN poll is the third in which he has hit 1% support, the threshold to qualify. (With so many candidates, the party may tighten the rules, so qualifying doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019ll be on stage). Oddly, it appears to be voters who say they\u2019ve never heard of Bennet picking him as their choice in the poll. Joe Biden still leads the Democratic presidential field by a substantial margin, but support for the former vice-president has dropped some since the beginning of his campaign, a new CNN poll finds. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters nationwide, Biden gets support from 32%, followed by 18% for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 8% for California Senator Kamala Harris, and 7% for Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. In an April CNN poll, Biden was at 39%, but none of the other candidates have made substantial gains to catch up with him. Donald Trump said in his meeting with Theresa May that the UK is the Unites States\u2019 biggest trade partner, a fact he said many people may not know. That may be because it is false: China is actually the largest US trade partner. Larry the Downing Street cat has been spotted staking out a spot under Donald Trump\u2019s limo. The US government spent millions of dollars on luxury hotel suites, chauffeured vehicles and back-up generators for Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to London, the Guardian\u2019s Severin Carrell reports. Contracts placed by the state department show US taxpayers have spent $1,223,230 on VIP accommodation at the InterContinental hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair, a hotel linked to members of the Qatari royal family. Another $339,386 has been spent on \u201chotel rooms in support of a visit\u201d at the Hilton on Park Lane, one of London\u2019s most exclusive addresses, and also on \u201cpassenger car rental\u201d. As Donald Trump meets with Theresa May in London, he urged her to reconsider her plans to resign and instead \u201cstick around\u201d to work out a post-Brexit trade deal. He was greeted by crowds of protesters, who flew a giant balloon depicting Trump as an orange baby. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke at the protest Tuesday. There\u2019s also a robotic likeness of Donald Trump on a golden toilet, per AP. Trump did not shake hands with May when he arrived at Downing Street, though he did shake hands with her husband. Follow our UK blog for more updates on the president\u2019s trip. Presidential hopeful Joe Biden released his plan to combat climate change on Tuesday. It proposes eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, CNN reports. It would cost $1.7tn over the first ten years. Biden proposes re-joining the Paris climate agreement, which Donald Trump pulled out of. The plan leaves a number of details to Congress to figure out, including how to require corporations to meet the emissions goals that the blueprint lays out. The plan embraces the framework of the Green New Deal, according to the Washington Post. He would reinstate many of the environmental policies in place under Barack Obama\u2019s administration, where he was vice-president, but with the target of eliminating net emissions goes significantly beyond what the previous White House achieved, per the New York Times. Progressive groups are expressing \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d over House Democrats\u2019 reluctance to impeach Donald Trump and pushing the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to move forward with impeachment in a new letter. The Associated Press reports: The groups said in a letter being released Tuesday that voters gave Democrats control of the House \u201cbecause they wanted aggressive oversight of the Trump administration.\u201d They said: \u201cThe Trump era will be one that evokes the question \u2014 what did you do? We urge you to use your power to lead and to stop asking us to wait.\u201d Pelosi has been reluctant to launch impeachment proceedings , despite growing numbers of Democrats saying it\u2019s time to start a formal inquiry. She says impeachment requires more public support and would detract from the legislative agenda. Instead, House Democrats are conducting dozens of investigations of the Trump administration , announced a series of new hearings and promised a vote next week to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas. But the groups, whose members include millions of Americans, say those being hurt by the Trump administration\u2019s policies and behavior don\u2019t have the privilege of waiting. \u201cThere are people who feel Trump\u2019s boot on their necks every single day,\u201d said Heidi Hess, co-director at CREDO Action. \u201cWe expect moral leadership from you.\u201d The groups signing onto the letter to Pelosi include Indivisible and Democracy for America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
