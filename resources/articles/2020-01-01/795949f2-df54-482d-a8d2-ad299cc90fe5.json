Speaking on Thursday, the Canadian prime minister called for a thorough investigation of the disaster as he endorsed mounting intelligence that the Ukrainian passenger jet was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile. \u201cWe have intelligence from multiple sources \u2013 including our allies and our own intelligence: the evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThis may well have been unintentional.\u201d He said that evidence only strengthened the need for a full investigation into the disaster. \u201cIt is now more important than ever to know exactly how this tragedy happens. Canadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government will not rest until we get that.\u201d Iran has disputed reports it accidentally brought down the plane, and suggested mechanical failure and a fire onboard the aircraft was the cause of the crash. News that the disaster may have been caused by a missile strike caused further distress for members of the Iranian community in Canada mourning the loss of friends and relatives. \u201cThis is new and incoming disturbing information \u2013 but if true, I\u2019m not surprised; especially given the actions of the Iranian regime,\u201d said Payman Parseyan, the former president of Edmonton\u2019s Iranian Heritage Society. But Praseyan said that no amount of blame would bring back the victims. \u201cWe loved our community family and \u2013 whether the Iranian government was involved or not \u2013 they\u2019re not coming home.\u201d Sixty-three Canadians were onboard the Boeing 737-800, operated by Ukraine International Airlines, when it crashed near Tehran on Wednesday. One hundred and thirty-eight of the passengers were destined for Canada, making the crash the country\u2019s worst aviation disaster since the 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 268 citizens. Victims included Mansour Esnaashary Esfahani, 29, a civil engineering doctoral student in Ontario who had flown to Iran in December to get married. Esfahani had been due to return on 2 January to resume studies at the University of Waterloo, but decided to extend his ticket to 8 January. His wife, Hanieh, had planned to begin a new life in Canada with him in February \u2013 a reunion that is now impossible. Roja Azadian and her husband, Mohsen Ahmadipour, had expected to travel back to Ottawa together \u2013 but when they arrived at Tehran\u2019s bustling Imam Khomeini airport, airline staff told them a prior cancellation to part of Ahmadipour\u2019s ticket rendered the remainder of his journey invalid. He planned to follow his wife on a separate flight and be reunited in Canada. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get on the plane. His wife could get on the plane, unfortunately,\u201d Kevin Manesh, who knew the couple, told the Ottawa Citizen. \u201cHe was the lucky person who didn\u2019t get on the plane.\u201d Ontario resident Hamed Esmaeilion lost his wife, dentist Parisa Eghbalian, 42, and nine-year-old daughter, Reera, to the fatal crash. On Facebook, Esmaeilion posted tributes to his daughter - including a video of her playing the piano and a photo of the two reading the newspaper. \u201cWhat should I do? What should I do?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat should I do with the magazine subscriptions that are coming for you?\u201d Sahar Haghjoo, 37, helped settle immigrant and refugee women, working at the YWCA in Toronto \u2013 a job she held for five years. She was travelling in Iran with her only child, eight-year-old Elsa. Haghjoo\u2019s husband was expecting to greet his wife and daughter on Wednesday at Pearson airport, but the pair never arrived. Across the country on Thursday, schools flew their flags at half mast, honouring the grim news that many of the victims were students, researchers and academics. \u201cIt is an unspeakable loss,\u201d said Neda Maghbouleh, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto who studies Iranian migration through the US and Canada. Four University of Toronto students were killed in the crash. \u201cThe people we lost in the plane truly represented the smartest young researchers in the entire world,\u201d Maghbouleh told Reuters. Late Wednesday, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif \u2013 a rare formal communication between countries with no diplomatic relations. The two nations severed diplomatic ties in 2012 under the Canada\u2019s Conservative government \u2013 rendering any investigation by Canada exceedingly difficult. Despite previous pledges to revive relations, Trudeau has failed to do so. \u201cThe response by the Iranian government, the Iranian foreign minister, was open, was encouraging,\u201d said Champagne, who expressed optimism that consular officials would soon receive visas to go to Iran. A series of vigils and memorials are scheduled to take place across the country in the next few days to honour victims of the crash."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
