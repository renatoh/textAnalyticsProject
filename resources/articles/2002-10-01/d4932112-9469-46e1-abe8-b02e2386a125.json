At the recent Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies in Tokyo, mobile phone companies unveiled new technologies aimed at making our homes more user-friendly. Now, if you are one of the millions who don't use their videos to record because they can't work out how to do it (and when you do master it, you miss the last 30 seconds because the programme ran late), the idea of being able to operate your central heating from the keypad of your mobile might send you shrieking into the refuge home for Luddites. But this is exactly what the technology bods have in store for us. Homes of the future will boast doors that can be opened by remote control, lights that can be activated from your holiday hotel, fridges that will do their own grocery shopping, and toilet seats that can be warmed in anticipation. I recently paid a visit to the Orange House of the Future. From the outside, it looked unthreatening and cosily suburban, with its mock Victorian styling, and sweeping gravel drive. But I was being lulled into a false sense of security. To begin with, the front door didn't have a lock: a webcam did the job of the old videophone, and the door was activated by computer software rather than a key. And, once inside, this house had a mind of its own. Families had been living in the house for short periods, allowing the scientists to scrutinise them, Big Brother style, like guinea pigs. Each family member had a web tablet for storing information such as favourite TV programmes, music, recipes, and other vital information. In place of family snapshots in frames, there were virtual pictures on the wall, which can receive images downloaded by email, or zapped in from your friends' and family's mobile phones. The kitchen boasted a new Dyson washing machine, modified so that it can order its own powder and call up the engineer if it needs servicing. The main selling point of the house of the not-so-distant future is that you can control your home when you're not there. You can let your online supermarket delivery man in when there's nobody at home, and you can run a bath when you're just leaving the office. You can even keep an eye on the nanny while you're out at a dinner party. The problem is, the whole point of going out is so that you can close the door and leave it all behind. I'm not sure if I want my home to be on call 24 hours a day, like an expectant puppy waiting to play. And no, I don't know how to operate my video recorder either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
