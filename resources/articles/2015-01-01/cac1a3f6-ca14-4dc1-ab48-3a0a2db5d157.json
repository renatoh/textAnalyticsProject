Goalscorer Andy Halliday said the feat was, in essence, \u201cridiculous \u2026 It\u2019s the best day of my life so far.\u201d Some intimidating stats Besides the money, on paper this was the result that could never happen. Chelsea hadn\u2019t conceded more than two goals at home in a game all season; they hadn\u2019t conceded three or more to a lower-league FA Cup side since Oxford United turned them over in 1991; they hadn\u2019t conceded four to a third-tier side since Darlington\u2019s 4-1 romp in January 1958 \u2013 and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, as a manager at Benfica, Leiria, Porto, Chelsea, Inter and Real Madrid, had never conceded four goals in a home game. The odds on Bradford winning by any margin were 30-1. If you had bet on them to win 4-2, you\u2019d be having a very happy Sunday. True romance This is the Cup rediscovering its roots. The trophy in its current form was designed in 1910 by Messrs Fattorini and Sons of Bradford \u2013 and City were the first side to win it, in 1911. That final, against Newcastle, ended 0-0 at Crystal Palace, but Bradford won the replay at Old Trafford 1-0, with the goal scored by Scotsman Jimmy Speirs. The club\u2019s captain joined Leeds a year later \u2013 and was killed during the Battle of Passchendaele in August 1917, at the age of 31. And some punctured bravado Before kick-off, Mourinho said Chelsea were different to other title-chasers, who might fancy being knocked out so they could focus on the league. \u201cIt\u2019s not our mentality, not our way of thinking, not our DNA. The other day a coach of a big team was knocked out of the cup and he was saying: \u2018Good, very good. This is perfect for us.\u2019 If I lose against Bradford, I don\u2019t say that. I say it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d He was true to his word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
