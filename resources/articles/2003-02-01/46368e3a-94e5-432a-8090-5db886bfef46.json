The head of the most financially vulnerable team on the F1 circuit urged competitors to rally round to ensure no more teams follow Arrows and Prost into liquidation, by setting up a fund for potential failures. Stoddart hopes the other teams will be keen to keep at least ten teams on the circuit to avoid what he says will make the competition look \"very Mickey Mouse.\" The call follows the collapse of a mooted $30 million \"fighting fund\" that had been braodly agreed by F1 chiefs last month. Formula 1 bosses said last month that broad agreement had been reached for a cash pool, reported in the media at around $30 million, to prevent more teams from following Prost and Arrows into liquidation. However Eddie Jordan told reporters earlier this month that the matter had been a proposal by Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and was still an \"ongoing discussion\". Minardi look the most vulnerable team on the grid. They have to pay for their Cosworth engines and have yet to agree a deal with tyre supplier Bridgestone for the season which starts in Australia on March 9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
