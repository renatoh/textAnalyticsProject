There were protests from the victim and her family, but a judge at Leeds magistrates' court said that tragedies in Yorath's personal life and his genuine remorse \"just\" tilted the balance against a prison term. Yorath ploughed into call-centre worker Raziya Aslam, 27, in June while driving his Jaguar X-type home from a dinner with friends in Leeds. She suffered a broken pelvis and head injuries after Yorath, who had 120 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath (the legal limit is 35), mounted a central reservation. Yorath, 54, now assistant manager of league one football club Huddersfield Town, was banned from driving for 30 months, fined \u00a3500 and given a year's community rehabilitation order, including 60 hours of community service and a compulsory programme for drink-impaired drivers. He was told by the district judge, David Kitson: \"I am quite satisfied that the custodial threshold has been crossed. You have had to cope with tragedy in your own life, but your behaviour on this occasion could also have inflicted tragedy and heartbreak on another family, namely that of your young victim. \"Your two offences of driving under the influence of alcohol and without due care and attention aggravated each other. \"However, I am required to carry out a balancing act and consider personal mitigation - the fact you stopped immediately after the accident, gave assistance to the young girl, cooperated with police and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\" Yorath, a former captain of Wales, told police in a statement that the late-night accident was \"the worst thing that has ever happened to me\". His solicitor, Richard Manning, said in mitigation that Yorath, a key player in Don Revie's championship-winning Leeds team in the 1970s, had lived a life \"beset with difficulty and trauma\". His 15-year-old son Daniel died of a heart condition while playing football and he was working at Bradford City football club at the time of the fire which killed 58 fans in 1985. Earlier this year, his marriage had broken down. Mr Manning said: \"He earned a reputation as a 'hard man' during his playing career. Sometimes it is difficult for a man in that situation to recognise he needs help.\" Huddersfield Town said in a statement after sentencing: \"Terry is a big part of Huddersfield Town and he will continue to be so in his role as assistant manager to Peter Jackson.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
