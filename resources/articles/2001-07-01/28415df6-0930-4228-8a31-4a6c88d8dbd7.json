The watchdog faced criticism today after a Labour backbencher called for an inquiry into its handling of the collapse of Independent. The call came from Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, who said: \"The role of the FSA as the regulator must be investigated.\" Mr Gardiner's criticisms of the FSA's role in Independent's demise came after it emerged that French insurance regulator, Commission de Controle des Assurances (CCA), had told the FSA of its concerns about Independent, which had a French subsidiary, last year. \"Information provided by the French authorities in January 2001 added nothing to what we already knew about the UK company. Suggestions that we failed to act on a \"tip-off\" are incorrect,\" said the FSA. \"We recognised during 2000 that the company's capital base was inadequate to support the sort of expansion the company planned,\" it added. \"Our concern on this led the company to put on hold future expansion until it had raised new funds.\" However, the FSA said at no point did its French counterpart point to possible fraud at Independent Insurance. Mr Gardiner also criticised the FSA's lack of transparency, adding: \"The action the FSA takes should be public action. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.\" Mr Gardiner was speaking to the action group Creditors of Independent Insurance Group (CIIG), which is planning legal action to recoup the millions of pounds they claim Independent owes them. Independent, which has about 600,000 personal and commercial policyholders, collapsed into provisional liquidation last month. Corporate policy holders include Pizza Express and the London Fire Brigade, as well as a number of law firms and architects. Insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance spent about \u00a33m buying its loss-adjusting arm earlier this month. But Independent is not out of the woods: as well as CIIG's legal action, the insurer is facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office; and former chief executive Michael Bright is being sued by HSBC's private banking arm for an outstanding loan of \u00a34.28m. Stephen Alexander, a partner in law firm Class Law, which is leading the legal action on behalf of CIIG, said: \"It is clear there were great concerns in France and communications were made with the FSA in London. \"There are very serious questions to be asked of the regulator, because if they were in possession of vital information, it should have been distributed to market accordingly.\" Mr Alexander said the FSA, along with the DTI, were on their list of potential defendants. CIIG said it was still gathering evidence about the collapse and thought it likely it would be able to confirm who it would be suing in September. Meanwhile, provisional liquidators PricewaterhouseCoopers will be talking to MPs about Independent's collapse today. PWC will meet members of the all-party parliamentary insurance group in the House of Commons this afternoon. Chairman John Greenway, Conservative MP for Ryedale, said the committee would be asking \"searching questions\" about the concerns the FSA admit did exist months before the collapse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
