He has coined a term for the corporate bigwigs who were much in evidence at President George Bush's inauguration parties last week: the new American oligarchy. Amidst all the talk from Bush about an \"ownership society\", Monks says there is a new class in America - the top officers of publicly traded companies. He cites the tremendous accumulation of wealth by these new oligarchs. The remuneration of the chief executive officers of S&amp;P 500 companies (America's 500 biggest companies) has roughly doubled from $4.1bn (\u00a32.1bn) in the fiscal year 2000 to $8.1bn for 2003, Monks points out. \"Much like the recent experience in Russia, a few individuals in America under cover of law managed vastly to enrich themselves. In this they were aided by the explicit policies of the Bush administration which will be known in history as the time of the American oligarchy,\" he says. Harsh words, yet Monks is no radical firebrand. Now in his 70s, Monks is a highly respected member of the financial elite. He has been a partner in a law firm, chief executive of an oil company, and is one of the founding trustees of the Federal Employees' Retirement System, a retirement plan for public service staff. More recently, Monks started the consulting firm Institutional Shareholder Services and founded the successful activist investment fund known as Lens. For the last seven years Monks has also been involved with the UK-based Hermes Lens Asset Management company. This respected financier does not like what he sees of the corporate and regulatory landscape. He believes the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US equivalent of the Financial Services Authority in the UK, \"is in the thrall of the people it is supposed to regulate\". Monks says the SEC chairman, William Donaldson, appears to be tenacious and knowledgeable. \"I have vast personal respect for him. However, is he effective? No. He is not effective because he is basically leading a very divided SEC. He has not been able to convince his Republican colleagues of his way of thinking,\" Monks says. The SEC-floated proposals that shareholders should have a say in director nomination are sure to disappear now in the face of corporate lobbying, Monks argues. On Sarbanes-Oxley, the legislation that arose from Enron and other scandals, Monks says its \"a little bit of a blessing, and a little bit of a curse. It enables the business community to say 'there's too much regulation' and claim that 'we're tied down like Gulliver, the Lilliputians are killing us'.\" The Sarbanes-Oxley act, passed in 2002, set up an accounting watchdog and obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of company accounts. European companies quoted in the US will be obliged to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, although the SEC is under pressure to relax the rules for non-American firms. In fact, Monks says, the legislation is in large measure \"just box ticking\", although in some ways it is hugely important. \"Sarbanes-Oxley is the first time in 75 years that the federal government had a strong enough political consensus to beat the state bar association to pass a federal law.\" On climate change and US government policy, Monks is critical of ExxonMobil, the world's leading oil company. As reported in yesterday's Guardian, ExxonMobil is one of the US oil companies funding lobby groups that are targeting Britain to derail action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \"Everybody else in the world seems to think there is global warming, but if Exxon doesn't, it doesn't exist,\" says Monks. As a shareholder Monks regularly secures a speaking spot at the oil giant's annual general meeting and makes shareholder proposals to Lee Raymond, Exxon's combative chief executive, about separating the role of chairman and chief executive. \"Two years ago I called him emperor, I said he had more unaccountable power than the heads of the G8 (industrialised countries) and therefore we needed a new title for him, so I referred to him as emperor.\" Monks smiles, \"He didn't know what to do with that\". When he is not berating the likes of Exxon, Monks, is taking on new ventures. His latest is a large share in the environmental research firm Trucost. Monks is excited about the firm's ability to assign costs to companies from their environmental impact. \"That means you suddenly have numbers. With such numbers can come demands for accountability. You can go to companies and say: 'You are emitting this much of this, this much of this, what are you doing about it?'.\" Monks thinks this is the beginning for the real game of corporate governance. \"I'm trying to move away from a narrow, balance sheet type of accounting,\" he said. \"Everybody knows that accounting is inadequate. It's very, very difficult to get an expanded notion of accounting, where you take into account externalities, soft assets. Investing in Trucost is the beginning of an effort to do that.\" \u00b7 Tobias Webb is editor of Ethical Corporation magazine"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
