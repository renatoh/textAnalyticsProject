The former world No1 has not competed since losing in the fourth round of the US Open to Nadia Petrova, but she believes a break will help her finally shake off the lingering effects of a virus that has plagued her for the past seven months. \"After long reflection, I've decided to put a stop to the 2004 season,\" the Australian Open and Olympic champion said yesterday. \"I didn't regain my strength as I hoped these last few weeks. The last two years I made a lot of effort to get where I am now, to become the No1, to win grand slams and the Olympics.\" Henin began the year in style by winning the Australian Open for the first time, underlining her dominance in the women's game at that time. But she was beaten early in the French Open in May and did not even compete at Wimbledon as she was sidelined for most of the summer. Although she bounced back to win the Olympic gold medal in Athens she looked jaded at Flushing Meadows where she surrendered her world No1 spot in the rankings. \"It's logical that I'm this tired. A period of rest will allow me to recharge my batteries and become even stronger,\" she said. \"When I'm fully recovered, the enthusiasm to win will be even bigger. Even though I've had a tough season, I can't complain about my results: five victories and two big titles.\" Her decision to end the year prematurely means she will also miss the year-ending WTA Championship, which starts on November 10. Henin's successor as the world No1, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, has withdrawn from the Kremlin Cup tournament in Moscow because of injury. Mauresmo aggravated a nagging left thigh injury in the Porsche Grand Prix final against Lindsay Davenport on Sunday. Davenport won the first set 6-2 in a meeting between the tour's two top-ranked players, and Mauresmo then withdrew after her heavily taped thigh hampered her movement. Davenport is currently 15 points behind the Frenchwoman in the WTA Tour rankings. The American has a first-round bye in Moscow and a second-round victory will see her replace Mauresmo at the top of the rankings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
