Battling high expectations, crippling self-doubt and, in the end, themselves, it\u2019s an album that mirrors its difficult gestation, with songs often hampered by superfluous noodling. The good still shines through, however, not least in the lovely Ten Storey Love Song and lead single Love Spreads. The Menace (2000) Elastica Elastica\u2019s first attempt at following up their classic 1995 debut resulted in two members leaving and the band\u2019s temporary dissolution. The experimental and fractured The Menace eventually emerged, hastily recorded in six weeks. Disavowed by Justine Frischmann in 2013, it still offers glimpses of the band\u2019s arch indie pop nous, specifically in Mad Dog God Dam and Generator. Show Your Bones (2006) Yeah Yeah Yeahs Having seen their indie contemporaries repeat the same formula for album No 2, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were keen to reinvent themselves after 2003\u2019s art-rock explosion Fever to Tell. It wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 the band almost broke up during early sessions \u2013 but the results were sleeker and more melodic, paving the way for 2009\u2019s pop breakthrough, It\u2019s Blitz!. Congratulations (2010) MGMT Following 2007\u2019s Oracular Spectacular, Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser set about dismantling their new pop stardom. This densely packed album eschews short, sharp thrills in favour of Syd Barrett-esque experiments and opaque Eno tributes. Scuffed pop gems such as It\u2019s Working reward the effort, however. Pinkerton (1996) Weezer Riffing on Puccini\u2019s Madama Butterfly, the gloriously emo Pinkerton \u2013 the follow-up to Weezer\u2019s 1994 debut \u2013 wrong-footed a fanbase still singing along to their hit Buddy Holly. Saturated with the disdain frontman Rivers Cuomo felt towards his success, Pinkerton is now seen as a cult classic. Room on Fire (2003) The Strokes Having unleashed a host of copycats, New York\u2019s garage rock pinups initially wanted something different for album two. Nigel Godrich was hired as producer, before being replaced by Is This It\u2019s Gordon Raphael. The epitome of \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke ...\u201d, the album still delivers a handful of indie classics. Da Real World (1999) Missy Elliott The success of Elliott\u2019s ebullient 1997 classic Supa Dupa Fly set the bar so high it left the rapper creatively paralysed. \u201cI just kept going [to the studio] and nothing was sounding right,\u201d she told MTV. Her producer, Timbaland, demanded that she take a break, with the re-energising holiday not lightening a darker, more paranoid, but no less inventive second album. Surfing the Void (2010) Klaxons Having ridden the nu-rave wave to Mercury prize success with 2007\u2019s Myths of the Near Future, south London haircuts Klaxons quickly crashed down to Earth in a drug-fuelled haze. Three years later, they emerged with a new psych-tinged heaviness \u2013 buffeted by Slipknot producer Ross Robinson \u2013 and, in songs such as Echoes, gloriously OTT rock operas. Neither Fish Nor Flesh (1989) Terence Trent D\u2019Arby In the late 80s, D\u2019Arby was an undeniable superstar, his debut album, Introducing the Hardline, shifting 1.5m copies in the UK alone. While this hit-free, gloriously pretentious follow-up flopped spectacularly, there are some gorgeous moments, from the soul flex of I\u2019ll Be Alright to the Princely strut of Attracted to You. Paul\u2019s Boutique (1989) Beastie Boys Paul\u2019s Boutique, AKA the \u201cSgt Pepper of hip-hop\u201d, was a confounding sequel to 1986\u2019s more frat party-adjacent Licensed to Ill. Worried they\u2019d been dismissed as a joke, the New York trio hunkered down with eccentric producers the Dust Brothers to weave together a densely packed, sample-heavy tapestry that would become their defining album."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
