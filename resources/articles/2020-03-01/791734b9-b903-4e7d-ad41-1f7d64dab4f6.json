Care also insisted \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of people who have touched my genitals in a game of rugby\u201d, as he sought to play down the incident. His Harlequins teammate Marler is due in front of a disciplinary hearing in Dublin on Thursday after he was cited for grabbing Jones\u2019s genitals during the first half of England\u2019s 33-30 win against Wales. The incident was picked up on camera and quickly went viral with Jones later calling on officials to intervene. If found guilty Marler is facing a ban of at least 12 weeks for an incident which has polarised opinion \u2013 dismissed as a harmless joke by some and vehemently condemned by others. Paul Gustard, the Harlequins head of rugby, claimed on Wednesday that the incident was being blown out of proportion compared to the red card and subsequent three-week ban for the France prop Mohamed Haouas, who punched Scotland\u2019s Jamie Ritchie last weekend, as well as Manu Tuilagi\u2019s sending off for a shoulder to the head of George North. Care, meanwhile, acknowledged \u201cyou don\u2019t want kids seeing that\u201d but he feels the Wales captain would have reacted differently had his side won last Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a big deal,\u201d Care said. \u201cIf Wales win that game I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big an issue as it is. Alun Wyn Jones\u2019s reaction after the game is probably a disappointed and angry Alun Wyn Jones, and that is a way to take a bit of that anger out. That\u2019ll be my penny\u2019s worth. You could see there was no malice in it, it\u2019s a joke between two old teammates. I can understand why people have seen it the wrong way, you don\u2019t want to see kids seeing that. It was in a rugby environment and it happens a lot.\u201d Gustard was reluctant to comment until the outcome of Marler\u2019s hearing on Thursday, when Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes will also learn their fates for dangerous tackles during England\u2019s win last weekend. But the former England assistant coach did say: \u201cThe furore over this incident doesn\u2019t seem to be mirrored in the same amount of media coverage and people talking about the French [prop] that could have broken someone\u2019s jaw with a punch. Or a vicious tackle with no arms. That\u2019s kind of a frustration for me from a different point of view, because the safety of players is paramount.\u201d Gustard may call on Kyle Sinckler for Harlequins\u2019 Premiership Rugby Cup final against Sale on Sunday with England\u2019s scheduled Six Nations match in Italy postponed because of the coronavirus. With few Premiership clubs making a profit, Gustard conceded it could be catastrophic if future matches had to be played behind closed doors because of fears over the spread of the virus. \u201cIf we take away one of the club\u2019s biggest sources of revenue, there could be ramifications. I\u2019m not sure how viable it would be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
