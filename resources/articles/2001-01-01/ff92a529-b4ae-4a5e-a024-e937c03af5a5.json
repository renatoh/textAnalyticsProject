Alas, no longer. Perhaps it was too much to hope that subtlety of expression would triumph on a benighted day when bigotry and prejudice had been given official recognition. If Jim Davidson is worthy of a place in the New Year's honours list, then the nation is truly mired in its own inadequacy. At such a dismal time, gratitude was therefore due to two clubs who, although they have fallen, have at least not fallen from grace. In their uneasy flirting with a passing game, both still strove for something on a higher plane rather than accepting reality and joining the likes of Davidson in a rewarding descent into the gutter. Forest, realistically, have no chance of promotion to the Premiership, and Norwich, still under the caretaker charge of Nigel Worthington, will be happy merely to survive. Two understrength sides also had to combat a frost-scarred surface. It was a dire first half. When the whistle blew, a middle-aged man in a blue anorak clapped a desultory three times, realised that no one had joined in, and sheepishly opened his flask of coffee in total silence. The second half was slightly better. Perked up a little, this time the man clapped five times. \"Well, all the best then,\" he then said to no one in particular and, new year greetings dispensed, trudged off. Forest were formerly briefly in a play-off position but have won only one of their last six games. Their prospects of victory rested largely with the pace and balance of Marlon Harewood and the enthusiastic dribbling of Ben Olsen, a winger from American Major League Soccer who became more influential as the match progressed. A blundered clearance by Norwich's goalkeeper Andy Marshall, kicking the ball against Harewood's back, should have proved costly but Harewood lost his balance. In the ensuing panic, Stern John and Olsen saw shots blocked on the line. A header from Andrew Reid, one of a young group of players developing rapidly under the tutelage of Paul Hart, came closest for Forest after half-time. Norwich ran out of energy; presumably Delia has been sending Christmas leftovers down to the training- ground caff. Footballers cannot live on double cream alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
