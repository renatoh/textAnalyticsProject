Barrezueta is not alone. In recent days the coronavirus has swept into Guayaquil with deadly force, overwhelming local authorities, funeral homes and hospitals and leaving families such as his facing unthinkable horrors. Photographs and video footage emerging from this crisis-stricken coastal city look like images from the aftermath of a natural disaster: bodies wrapped in sheets and dumped on the roadside or outside houses; desperate families begging for help after being forced to keep their loved-ones corpses at home for days in temperatures of more than 30C. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving them in the streets, on the pavements, abandoned at home,\u201d tweeted the city\u2019s mayor, Cynthia Viteri, herself now in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19. \u201cWhat is going on in Guayaquil?\u201d Barrezueta, a 33-year-old odd-job man from the city\u2019s south, has had a front row seat to the dystopia, which many fear offers a terrible glimpse of the future for other Latin American cities as coronavirus accelerates its march across the region. His 57-year-old father fell ill on 18 March, a week after Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, declared a nationwide coronavirus emergency and nearly three weeks after the country\u2019s first confirmed case. For five days Reynaldo Barrezueta suffered body and headaches before appearing to improve. But last Thursday Barrezueta said his father deteriorated, developing a ferocious cough, and was taken to Guayaquil\u2019s Monte Sina\u00ed hospital where a chest x-ray suggested he was suffering from pneumonia caused by Covid-19. Barrezueta claimed swamped health workers told him they had no room to admit his father and they returned home with instructions to treat him with paracetamol. At about 6am on Monday he woke with chest pains and breathing difficulties before dying in front of his family, apparently from a heart attack. On Thursday lunchtime, more than three days later, his body was still there \u2013 a black binbag draped over the coffin in a futile attempt to conceal the growing stench of decomposition. In a desperate bid to attract the attention of authorities, the victim\u2019s son posted a video on social media in which he kneels down beside the casket, wearing a yellow face mask, and begs: \u201cPlease, I\u2019m on my knees asking you to come and help me\u201d. But so far \u2013 with the city\u2019s morgue reportedly full and corpse collectors overwhelmed by the sheer number of dead \u2013 no one has. Fernando Jim\u00e9nez, the owner of one local funeral parlour, said he had closed his business because it was impossible to secure burial slots at the cemetery. \u201cThere was so much emergency demand that we couldn\u2019t cope,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is really out of control.\u201d A report in one local newspaper, Expreso, suggested the tragedy was only just beginning. \u201cThe situation is going to get even worse,\u201d it predicted on Thursday as Ecuador\u2019s government said it expected Guayaquil would suffer up to 3,500 deaths in the coming months. So far, few Latin American countries have been worse affected by coronavirus than Ecuador \u2013 and nowhere has been worse hit than Guayaquil where nearly half of the country\u2019s 3,163 confirmed cases have been recorded. Experts say one explanation is the high levels of air traffic between Ecuador and Spain, which is home to more than 400,000 Ecuadorian migrants and which has the world\u2019s second-highest death toll from the disease. The first Covid-19 case recorded in the South American country was of a 71-year-old woman who flew into Guayaquil from Madrid in mid-February and died there on 13 March. Others suspect Ecuador\u2019s failure to quickly impose and enforce effective quarantine measures may have played a role, although the government rejects that charge. The port city\u2019s plight has sent shockwaves across a region where many already fragile health systems are now bracing for a similar wave of patients and deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to snooze. It\u2019s time to get ready,\u201d El Salvador\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted this week, pointing to Guayaquil\u2019s calamity as proof. \u201cThey said the pandemic wouldn\u2019t be so bad in Latin America because we\u2019re used to illness, because it\u2019s hot, because our population\u2019s young,\u201d added Bukele, who has ordered some of the region\u2019s fastest and strictest anti-Covid measures. \u201cBut just look at what is happening in Ecuador.\u201d Pie de P\u00e1gina, a Mexican news website, warned: \u201cFor the rest of the world, Guayaquil is a nightmare that could come true\u201d. For Barrezueta and his 30-year-old wife, Katiuska Castro, it is an ordeal that is still playing out. As they sat at home with his Reynaldo\u2019s cadaver on Thursday, the father-of-two said grief would have to wait. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s a huge loss. He\u2019s my dad. We feel awful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting sick ourselves now. We\u2019ve got all the symptoms \u2026 diarrhoea, fever \u2026 muscle aches. And we can\u2019t go to the hospital because if you go to the hospital you just get more infected and they won\u2019t see you anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s been here in the sitting room for three days and my family is getting infected,\u201d complained Barrezueta, who has sent his two sons \u2013 aged two and four \u2013 to stay with relatives to get them out of danger. Ecuador\u2019s official coronavirus death toll now stands at 120, some 82 of which were recorded in the province of Guayas, of which Guayaquil is the capital. But Barrezueta, like many here, said he suspected the true figure was far higher. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a very difficult situation here right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president isn\u2019t here. He\u2019s hiding. We don\u2019t know where he is. We\u2019ve got no mayor. No governor. We\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s chaos. There\u2019s no-one to help us. We are afraid,\u201d Barrezueta later added in a WhatsApp message. \u201cPlease. We need help. We are dying here and nobody is doing anything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
