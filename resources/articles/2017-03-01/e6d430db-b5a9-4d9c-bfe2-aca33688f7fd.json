Pierce Brosnan stars as wealthy Irish mogul Mike Regan, who leases private jets: Brosnan plays him brash, with maybe a touch of Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary. Regan is devoted to his lovely wife and daughter, played by Anna Friel and Stefanie Scott, but he\u2019s over-leveraged the business and has secret money troubles. So Mike\u2019s hugely grateful when a young IT guy on his staff, Ed (James Frecheville) saves his ass by fixing a computer glitch that had threatened to wreck a vital presentation. He invites Ed to his \u201csmart\u201d designer home, where Ed sorts out the wifi that runs all the gadgets there. But then Ed conceives a creepy fascination with Mike\u2019s lovely daughter and glam lifestyle and starts to stalk them all. There are some nice touches, but it unwinds into dullness and silliness and the hi-tech conceit is basically abandoned in favour of low-tech analogue violence and punch-ups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
