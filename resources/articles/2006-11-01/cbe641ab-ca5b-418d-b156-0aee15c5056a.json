Questions like defence, foreign affairs, nuclear power and economic policy are supposed to be \"reserved\" to Westminster. At least that's the theory. But the divisions are becoming increasingly blurred. Last week, Jack McConnell called for Scotland to be included in any cut in corporation tax introduced for the Stormont assembly. He has made clear his opposition to any nuclear power stations if there is no solution to the nuclear waste problem - though the opposition parties don't believe him. This week, McConnell waded into the controversy over the replacement of Trident, echoing the words of the UK cabinet dissidents Peter Hain and Hilary Benn, in calling for a full debate about the options for Britain's nuclear deterrent. Now, the FM has form here. In September he expatiated on the future of nuclear arms reduction, proposing that Trident could be \"negotiated away in talks with countries like Iran\". He was rubbished at the time for his intervention, not least by Labour spokesmen in London, one of whom called this idea \"completely ridiculous\". Well now, of course, thanks to the work of the US Senate Iraq Study Group, everyone is talking about talking to Iran. The FM feels he has been vindicated. Mind you the question remains about exactly why he is speaking about this in the first place. Defence and foreign affairs are very definitely not powers of the Scottish parliament. It doesn't get much more reserved than this, and there were real questions about whether the presiding officer of the Scottish parliament, (the equivalent of the speaker in Holyrood) should have allowed such matters to be raised at question time. The reason McConnell is so outspoken on all this is pretty obvious. He faces a determined anti-nuclear opposition in the shape of the Scottish National party, the only truly unilateralist political party of any significance left in the UK. The Nationalists see the presence in the Clyde of Britain's four Vanguard submarines, and their 48 Trident missiles, to be a violation of Scottish national sovereignty, a threat to world peace, and a breach of Britain's international treaty obligations. They aren't the only ones. The Scottish churches have mounted a highly effective lobbying campaign, contacting all the former unilateralists in the Scottish Labour group of MSPs, asking them to state their views on Trident replacement. A clear majority are privately opposed to replacement, and are saying so. It is likely that Jack McConnell is one of them. He insists that the only utility of a system like Trident, which cannot be used against any known target, is to deploy it as a means of promoting disarmament. In Scotland there is a lively debate taking place about this, which just isn't happening south of the border because the main opposition part in Westminster, supports Trident renewal. This divergence in political culture is important. In Scotland it is regarded by many as self-evident that a system as controversial as Trident should not be imposed on a country other than with the wholehearted consent of the people. All opinion polls show Scotland to be opposed to it. If Trident is imposed on Scotland, as seems likely, there is going to be very widespread dissent to the policy, stretching across all the main parties in the Scottish parliament. Trident is another of those deeply corrosive issues, like immigration, nuclear power, taxation, which is forcing a very wide spread of Scottish public opinion to question the union. The days may have passed when CND could mobilise tens of thousands of protesters in Scotland to march against the nuclear presence in the Clyde. But in a quiet way a more serious anti-nuclear coalition is being forged in Scotland; one which Westminster ignores at its peril."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
