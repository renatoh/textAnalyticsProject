In the process they have done much to reinvigorate Mike and Kate Westbrook's status as UK parallels to Carla Bley in their mix of mischievousness and sonority. This Rossini venture was originally commissioned for a street festival in Lausanne in 1984, with the William Tell overture as its theme. The Westbrooks stitched a jazz envelope around it, for a predominantly brass band with the contrasting reeds sounds of sopranino saxist Lindsay Cooper and the fleet and flawless altoist Peter Whyman wheeling over it. Whyman's alto scythes its way out of Andy Grappy's tuba lines at the opening, the group momentarily suggesting the Liberation Music Orchestra on The Thieving Magpie, and the 18 minute L'Amoroso E Sincero Lindoro (from The Barber of Seville) moves from piano meditations to languorous brass themes and on to Whyman's tantalising squeals and interrogations. If you didn't think a funk version of the Lone Ranger theme was feasible, check this one out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
