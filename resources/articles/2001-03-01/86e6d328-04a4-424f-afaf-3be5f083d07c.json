The Business &amp; Society report was presented by Kim Howells, minister for corporate social responsibility. Mr Howells was appointed by Tony Blair a year ago to persuade more companies to \"give something back\" to their communities and to convince businesses that a caring attitude could be good for the bottom line. But only 50% of FTSE 100 companies provide annual environmental reports and only 28% set out their social policies. In the report, Mr Howells detailed government plans to use the Small Business Service to help small firms with corporate social responsibility policies and to provide guidance to pension fund managers to encourage them to invest in companies that encourage international development and sustainable development. Six months ago supermarket chain Asda launched a scheme designed to put its 241 stores at the heart of their local communities. It helps local organisations and builds links with the fire service, police, schools and local suppliers. The Leeds children pictured are taking part in Asda's current campaign to back the government's healthy eating drive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
