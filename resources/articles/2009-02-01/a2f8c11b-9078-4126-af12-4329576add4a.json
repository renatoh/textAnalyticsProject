The third- and fourth-placed sides meet at Villa Park in Guus Hiddink's first match in charge of Chelsea, with Petrov suggesting that the Dutchman has inherited a team that has lost the unwavering belief that characterised their performances under Mourinho. \"When Mourinho was there they had a special team,\" said the Villa midfielder, recalling the back-to-back Premier League titles Chelsea won under the Portuguese in 2005 and 2006 and the winning mentality he instilled in his players. \"I think they had more belief in themselves. I don't think Chelsea are the team that they used to be under Mourinho. A lot of changes have happened there.\" Petrov's comments follow Sir Alex Ferguson's criticism of what he perceives to be a lack of patience at Stamford Bridge following the surprise dismissal of Luiz Felipe Scolari last week after only seven months in charge. Ferguson suggested the decision to sack the Brazilian had \"played into the hands\" of United, although Petrov expects the change in manager to produce an immediate reaction at Villa Park as Chelsea look to regain some momentum in their push for silverware. \"They'll come here and be strong,\" the Bulgarian international said. \"They have a new manager and every new manager wants to start with a win, so we are expecting a hard game. They'll try to show that they can still be at the top but we'll try to show them that what we have achieved so far is not just because of luck but because we've been playing well.\" Petrov admitted that Villa, who are likely to have James Milner and Emile Heskey available again following injury, have a point to prove after their 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in October. Villa had been tipped by many to provide a demonstration of their ability to challenge the top four, but Chelsea delivered arguably their best performance under Scolari. \"That's the game we were really outplayed,\" admitted Petrov."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
