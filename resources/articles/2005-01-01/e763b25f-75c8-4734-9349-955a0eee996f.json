It works mostly just by having the courage of its own very silly convictions. It doesn't do jokes so much as create characters and let them run with it, relying on tried and trusted comedy performers. Ben Stiller does his patented short, uptight guy act - Stiller's 5ft 8, but the film surrounds him with giant musclemen, so he looks about 5ft 3 here. In contrast, big Vince Vaughn plays it surprisingly straight as the easygoing owner of a rival gym Stiller wants to take over. Best of all, the great Rip Torn is Patches O'Houlihan, veteran coach in a wheelchair whose methods consist mainly of throwing heavy metal objects at his team: \"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.\" Oh, and there's a lissom blonde - isn't there always - who goes from anxious businesswoman to free-spirited team member in the twinkling of an eye. This brings back horrible memories of our own archetypally bad genre film Up'n'Under. Dodgeball is apparently a real US sport - the rules seem to be that one team throws things and the other team dodges. The film stays consistently funny by staying close to all the cliches but exaggerating them that bit further: so, for instance, when our hero is having his crisis of confidence, he runs into a dodgeball fan who inspires him and just happens to be cancer-conquering cycle champ Lance Armstrong. It stays pretty close to the Spinal Tap formula, right down to a ludicrous commentating duo, without having quite as wild an imagination, but it shows enough originality to avoid copyist claims. Rawson Marshall Thurber, the film's 29-year-old writer-director, looks like one to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
