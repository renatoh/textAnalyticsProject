Days after X-Men: Apocalypse topped the weekend domestic box office, Marvel and FX have announced plans to launch a full season of Legion \u2013 a new TV series set in the X-Men universe \u2013 helmed by Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley. The eight-episode first season will debut in early 2017 on the cable platform. Downton Abbey\u2019s Dan Stevens will star as David Haller, who in the comics is son to X-Men founder Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart in the film franchise). The show finds Haller struggling after being diagnosed as schizophrenic. A strange encounter with a fellow patient leads him to believe that the visions he sees might indeed be real. Parks and Recreation star Aubrey Plaza will also feature, while Fargo actors Jean Smart and Rachel Keller round out the cast. \u201cJust as he did in reimagining Fargo, he is bringing an entirely new aesthetic and sensibility to the enormously popular and richly represented X-Men world,\u201d the FX original programming president, Nick Grad, said in a statement. FX had green-lit a pilot to Legion seven months ago, with Stevens attached to star. The show will join the ever-expanding Marvel small-screen universe, which is now led by the Netflix shows Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders and an upcoming Punisher spinoff, as well as ABC\u2019s Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter. Fox meanwhile has Hellfire, based on the Marvel comics group The Hellfire Club, in the works. In other comic book news, another Fantastic Four film is still a possibility, despite the spectacular bombing of the recent reboot with critics and audiences. Appearing on Josh Horowitz\u2019s Happy Sad Confused podcast, co-writer/producer Simon Kinberg said a followup is \u201ca big part of [Fox\u2019s superhero] plan going forward\u201d. \u201cI would love to continue making movies with that cast,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
