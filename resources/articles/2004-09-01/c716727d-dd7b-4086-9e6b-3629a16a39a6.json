If we're not actually eating, we're usually thinking about what we can have next and wondering how long we will have to wait for it. So I approached a holiday in Kenya with some trepidation. Reading the Lonely Planet guide, it seemed we'd be living on tough meat stews and curries served up with stodgy starch fillers. 'They'll fill you up, but it's really just survival food ... vegetarians will really struggle as meat features in almost every dish.' Oh dear. My daughter, Imogen, has pretty eclectic tastes, but gristly meat stews do not feature high on her list of must-eats. She's not that keen on fish either - she's the only seven-year-old I know who hates fish fingers - so I wondered how she would fare on Lamu, a piscatorially rich island off Kenya's northern coast. I hadn't allowed for the cuisine at Peponi, our hotel on Lamu. Arriving by dhow from the tiny airstrip on the neighbouring island of Manda, we were ushered to the shady veranda overlooking the channel between the two islands, offered fresh fruit juice and asked to address the serious business of choosing what we wanted for dinner that night. As soon as I saw the menu I realised this was going to be the biggest decision every day on Lamu. Should I go for the tuna carpaccio or a hot, spicy mangrove crab? Bajias - a Swahili dish that looks like chicken nuggets but is made of beans - served with a hot sour sauce, or samaki wa kupaka, a whole grilled fish basted in spices and coconut cream? I opted for grilled lobster, while Imogen settled on ham and pineapple pizza - not such the cop-out it sounds, as the pizza was homemade with large chunks of fresh fruit. The next day we watched as a large washing basket of big prawns was carried off the beach into the hotel. That night I had piri piri prawns fried quickly in their shell with marsala, garlic and lime juice. Exquisite. Imogen had spaghetti bolognese with a garden salad. Then we started working our way through the ice cream and sorbets: lime, mango, banana, passion fruit, and a rich vanilla and chocolate variety that actually tasted of chocolate. Perhaps the culinary highlight of the week was a Swahili dish of crisp vegetarian samosas, prawns cooked in spices, coconut cream and tamarind, chapati and halva, a local Turkish delight that tasted of cardamom. The best thing about the meal was the setting: a table above the pool, overlooking the beach. Candles along the path and set into the wall lit our approach and shone romantically over the food. (Shame I was sharing it with a seven-year-old.) There are other things to do on Lamu apart from eat, as long as you approach them in a relaxed way. The Kenyan coast has long been the last port of call for people who have been on safari - a chance to extend the suntan beyond face and arms and to chill out after pursuing wildlife from dawn to dusk. Indeed, Lamu has turned relaxation into an art form. If relatively few British people have heard about the place it could be because the Kenyans keep quiet about it. It's too special to share with a load of Europeans and Americans, although a select few - including Princess Caroline of Monaco, who owns three houses in Shela village, where Peponi is sited - have been let in on the secret. The island was first colonised more than 1,000 years ago, when Arabs and Persians began settling on the African coast, and although building is still going on in Lamu town and Shela, it's all in keeping with the beautiful stone houses and mosques built by the merchants of Oman in the 18th century. The word Swahili comes from the Arab word Sahil, which means coast, and is said to have originated in the Lamu area. The whole island has changed very little over the centuries - there are no cars, and therefore no roads. Everyone gets around by dhow or donkey - there is one donkey for every two people on the island. We strolled (no one does anything faster here) along the eight miles of empty white sand that extend from the walls of Peponi, picking up fragile sand dollars. We fed breakfast scraps to the Egyptian-looking cats that live alongside donkeys and fishermen, had henna tattoos applied by a woman on the beach, and took a dhow ride to Manda to swim around the coral pools in search of huge shiny cowries. Imogen played at being shipwrecked with her new friend, Marcella, collecting fallen coconuts for their food store. I snoozed on one of the sumptuous swinging sunbeds while Imogen splashed in the pool, shaded from the fierce sun by three fat baobab trees. Social life - very much of a laid-back, decadent, colonial kind - revolves around the Peponi bar, and the hotel owner, Lars Korschen (think of a young Bill Nighy in Love Actually mode), is usually nearby. Peponi runs a dhow from the hotel to Lamu town every morning and foreigners are asked to wear long trousers and sleeves so as not to offend the islanders, who are predominantly Muslim, many of the women wearing full purdah. With our guide, Abdullah, we wandered the narrow alleys, peeking past ornate Moorish doors into dark interiors. En route he took us to visit his pals: a silversmith, a woodcarver, a man who ran a general store which sold just the basket Imogen was hankering after. A guest-house owner let us look inside a traditional Swahili house. From the outside it looked shabby, but inside was beautiful etched plaster, with niches (vedaka) set into the wall to show off the occupants' prized belongings. Each house has its own well, and the kitchen is on the roof so smoke doesn't ruin the plasterwork. Over the next few days we walked, swam and sailed with Abdullah, and sometimes with his son, Sultan. The thing we both wanted desperately to do, but which couldn't be fixed by Abdullah, was to spot a green turtle. Carol Korschen, Lars's wife, runs a turtle-protection scheme, buying the huge adults sometimes caught by fishermen to release them back into the sea. As they are tender and tasty, a delicacy prized by locals, this is not cheap. She also pays a family on Manda to protect turtle nests, subsidising her costs by taking hotel guests to see the young hatching. We set off at 6.30am. Most of the baby turtles had appeared during the night, but a few were still struggling to the surface and slithering down the dune to the surf below. They were tiny - about three inches long - and surprisingly soft. Some still had yolk sacks attached to their bellies which, Carol told us, would have to be absorbed before they entered the water or they would be weighed down and drown. That afternoon Sultan took us fishing with hand lines on his father's dhow. While I succeeded only in feeding large, succulent prawns to whatever was out there, Imogen caught two white snapper, a black snapper, something with spots and a rather attractive parrot fish. Sultan gutted and descaled the fish over the side of the boat, insisting I take one back for my supper. I had been planning to revisit the piri piri prawns, but one look at Imogen's face told me that fresh fish for dinner it was. On returning to Peponi I handed over the snapper. Three hours later we were reunited with them, this time chaperoned by salad and chips. What a pity Imogen's moment of glory was marred: she was so exhausted that she fell asleep, head on the table, and completely missed the arrival of her excellent catch.
