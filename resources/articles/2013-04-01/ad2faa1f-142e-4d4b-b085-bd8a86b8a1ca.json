The quiet pragmatism of the Kaesong industrial complex survived nuclear tests, UN sanctions, rocket launches, sinkings, shellings \u2013 the full panoply of martial bluster. Until Tuesday, when 53,000 North Korean workers failed to show up. Its suspension is more significant than other actions ordered by Kim Jong-un \u2013 including work on restarting a plutonium production reactor. Kaesong was the symbol of co-operation between the two Koreas, the last ray of the sunshine policy that created it, a sign of what could be possible on the peninsula if sanity returned one day. If the underlying message from the young North Korean leader is that his nukes aren't for sale, Kaesong's suspension was the strongest way he has found of delivering it. What follows is anyone's guess. Japan is taking no chances, after the deployment of two untested medium-range rockets on North Korea's eastern coast, and with two anniversary dates coming up on which to fire them. Missile interceptors were deployed on Tuesday outside Tokyo, adding a further layer of defence to the one provided by destroyers in the Sea of Japan. In South Korea, there is low-level anxiety, but nobody is leaving Seoul, or stocking up on bottled water; the capital is nothing like Tokyo after the tsunami. It is sensibly waiting for the storm to blow over. Each further action from the North limits the options for President Park Geun-hye \u2013 whose long-term instincts that this will only be solved through negotiation are right. The day Pyongyang told all foreigners to leave the South is no time to start putting her \"trustpolitik\" into action. Her only option is to keep up the show of force, keep the military exercises with the US going until the end of the month, and hope the fire burns itself out. The same does not apply to Washington or Beijing, for whom this crisis presents an opportunity not be wasted. Xi Jinping's speech on Sunday, in which he implicitly admonished North Korea by saying that no one should be allowed to throw the region into chaos, should not be overinterpreted. China is not about to flip from retaining North Korea to abandoning it, but it could recalibrate the tools it uses to preserve stability on the Korean peninsula. Washington has hopefully understood the advantages of caution and should indeed avoid giving Pyongyang any excuse for further escalation. If Kim Jong-un is playing a game of Russian roulette, it is with his relationship with China, which he may well need in future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
