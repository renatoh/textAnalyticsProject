Registering on the InfoFlyway site will be worth your while. I know; I'm trying. But you're not helping. I want to go to Hamburg, but the form is in German. Registered user only: that is the rule in some sectors of the InfoFlyway. This is because we can only carry out your wishes if we know you. Well, I find that a bit debatable - after all, you won't ask me for my name and e-mail address if I call you on the phone, will you? And I still can't log in. Time to call the Lufthansa UK line and see if the \u00a366 Stansted-Hamburg special is available in June. No; the cheapest fare for those dates is \u00a3165. Let's try the site again. Ah - now the form is in English. I typed in London and Hamburg, but you made me submit the page twice before you recognised both. Back to the home page. Welcome Ms Taylor, if you are interested in discount fares, then we recommend you read our Booking Tips. Thanks for recognising me. But I'm off to investigate the German Railways site."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
