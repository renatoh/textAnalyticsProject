Miuccia Prada and Alexander McQueen liven up the fashion schedule, not just because of more striking designs but because of the intellectual scope and interests of the designers themselves. Whereas most designers content themselves with warbling on about \"a new kind of masculinity\" or \"the new male silhouette\", Prada and McQueen have taken inspiration from areas as diverse as bio-dynamic science and 1970s horror films, reflecting their own wide-ranging interests. Of course, this kind of thematic referencing can easily tip over into gimmickry, a weakness to which McQueen in particular is prone. McQueen's collection took the theme of different types of masculinity, from classic Hollywood leading men to mods and skinheads to football hooligans and shadowy villains. At times the collection was too scattered for its own good (a python trenchcoat came out at one point, as did knitwear coated with rubber), but the stiff coats with exaggerated rounded shoulders, the narrow but not skinny trousers and the use of colour, such as the blue seams and straps on black clothes, looked so stylish, yet still masculine. But the Prada collection, an example of which is pictured, looks set to be the most interesting of the week. It is unlikely that the ski trousers will take off on the streets of Britain, but the dip-dyed coats and shirts, the grey wool check coats that fade to black at the hem, the flat front boxy cut jackets and the oversized sports tops with drawstring neck and hems were all smart but cool and would appeal to young and, unusually, older customers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
