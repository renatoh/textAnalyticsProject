The award, set up last year by the Guardian and Private Eye in memory of the late campaigning journalist Paul Foot, went to Sunday Telegraph journalist David Harrison. His articles, acclaimed by the United Nations, forced action from the Home Office and police. Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: \"We thought this would be the best way of remembering his [Foot's] life and supporting the kind of work he did.\" Owen Gibson \u00a325,000 for disused loo with ocean view A disused toilet block with views to the Atlantic on one side and the wild moors of west Cornwall on the other yesterday fetched \u00a325,000 at auction in London. The squat granite building with 0.04 hectares (0.1 acres) of land on the road between St Ives and Land's End was sold to a private individual, believed to be from Cornwall. Penwith council planners say the site cannot be developed, but local people fear a determined developer may eventually ruin an unspoilt stretch of coast. Richard Argles, senior surveyor for auctioneer Colliers CRE, said: \"The interest was phenomenal.\" Steven Morris 'No grassroots support' for new body to fight bias The single equality body that is being set up by the government to combat all types of discrimination lacks any grassroots support, Britain's leading disability rights activist warns today. Bert Massie, chairman of the Disability Rights Commission, will identify a \"credibility gap\" between the body and the groups it is meant to serve. Many wanted \"to strangle it at birth\". The body, to be known as the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, could only work if the government appointed commissioners who were \"real representatives of the marginalised\" instead of the usual suspects, he will say. John Carvel Cancer sufferer honoured for \u00a31.4m charity ride Jane Tomlinson, who defied cancer to raise \u00a31.4m for charity, was among the women honoured yesterday in the Women Of The Year Awards. A women's rights campaigner, a charity founder, and two women who brought the moving arts exhibition the Sultan's Elephant to London were also recognised at the annual ceremony in London. Ms Tomlinson, who cycled 3,800 miles across the US despite having incurable breast cancer, won the Woman Of The Year Outstanding Achievement Award. Woman of the Year was children's charity founder Camila Batmanghelidjh. Press Association Negative expressions most readily inherited Negative facial expressions such as anger and disgust are more strongly inherited than positive ones, according to a new study. A team led by Gili Peleg at the University of Haifa in Israel filmed the facial expressions of 21 people born blind, and one or more of their sighted relatives. Because the blind subjects could not have seen and copied family facial expressions, the researchers believe genes play a big role. The team reports in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that family similarities are most obvious in angry faces, followed by surprise, disgust, joy and sadness. James Randerson Remorseful thief returns rare bird's egg 43 years on A rare bird's egg stolen from a museum has been returned 43 years after the theft. Staff at the Overbeck's Museum, Salcombe, Devon, were astonished when they received a little bustard's egg wrapped in a letter of confession. Signed \"John\", it reads: \"The enclosed tin contains the egg of a little bustard that I stole from your museum when I was on a hitchhiking trip through the West Country in my early teens in 1963 ... I do apologise profusely: we do things as kids that we would never dream of doing as adults.\" The egg had resurfaced after the death of one of \"John's\" parents. Steven Morris The History Boys creator condemns tuition fees The writer Alan Bennett today accuses the Labour government of betrayal in introducing university tuition fees. In an interview with Education Guardian, Bennett says it is \"morally wrong\" to force students into debt. Bennett's play The History Boys, released as a film last week, is about a group of sixth-formers applying to Oxbridge. \"I believe all students should have the same access to education as I did ... I voted for Labour because of this and feel let down,\" he said. \"The party has betrayed itself and it will be viewed by history as mistake.\" Will Woodward Teenager admits killing boy, 15, outside school A teenager admitted at the Old Bailey yesterday to stabbing to death a 15-year-old boy, Kiyan Prince, outside the boy's school gates. The 16-year-old youth, from north London, who cannot be named because of his age, denied murder, but admitted manslaughter. His trial on the murder charge is due to open today. Kiyan, a promising footballer who played for Queen's Park Rangers' youth team, was stabbed to death near the London Academy, Edgware, on May 18. The court heard that several witnesses will be giving evidence via video, because of their young age. Agencies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
