For years, the small community of La Mora also maintained an uneasy peace with the mafia gangs who dominate this part of northern Mexico: identifying themselves at cartel checkpoints and avoiding the region\u2019s lonely dirt roads after dark. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been stopped on the road \u2013 cartel groups just wanting to know who we are,\u201d said Kenneth Miller Jr, a resident of the little town. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had to worry about much. We were always warned beforehand if there was stuff going on in the area.\u201d But if the Mormons ever thought they would be protected by the US passports which most of them hold, any such illusions were shattered this week. Six children and three women \u2013 all US citizens \u2013 were massacred on a dirt road nearby, when gunmen ambushed their convoy of SUVs, killing children at point-blank range and shooting one mother as she begged for their lives. \u201cThey shot the shit out of my grandchildren, my daughters, daughter-in-law \u2013 just burned them to a crisp,\u201d said an anguished member of the family in a voice message shared among relatives, which was passed on to the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. Just a few bones.\u201d The massacre prompted Donald Trump to call for \u201cWAR\u201d against the cartels, mounding pressure on Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president whose discourse has forgone the militarized strategy of his predecessors in favor of a vaguely defined strategy of moral renovation. But the incident has also thrust the isolated Mormon communities into the spotlight, highlighting their long history in a harsh corner of the country, their origins as religious renegades fleeing US laws against polygamy \u2013 and their more recent brushes with Mexican drug cartels. In the town of La Mora, about 70 miles south of the Arizona border, nobody is sure what exactly provoked Monday\u2019s attacks. Mexican officials have speculated that cartel gunmen mistook the group of women and children for members of a rival armed group. The region is understood to be the site of a battle for dominance between an organized crime group known as La L\u00ednea, based in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Chihuahua, and another group known as Los Salazar based in Sonora and affiliated with the Sinaloa cartel. But the eight children who survived \u2013 several of them with serious gunshot wounds \u2013 told a story of senseless violence, in which one of the women got out of her SUV to signal that they were women and children, only to be shot dead. The man in the audio recording \u2013 identified by a source as Kenneth Miller Sr \u2013described the aftermath of the attack, in which a search party from La Mora set out to find the missing families, only to turn back when they realized gunmen they suspect belonged to the Chihuahua faction were still in position on a nearby hilltop. \u201cPretty soon, here comes the Sonoran guys. Literally 50, 60 [of them] and they waited there. And they were a little nervous, too. So until they coked up \u2013 when they finally got brave to go \u2013 they went on in and we followed,\u201d he said in the recording, which was shared via WhatsApp. Relatives of the victims acknowledge that the security situation in the region had started to deteriorate as the rival crime groups battled to control the isolated road running north towards the frontier. \u201cThe tensions have escalated in the last few months. The Chihuahua side and the Sonora side have been battling over this route for a while now,\u201d Miller Jr said. \u201cThe Chihuahua side is trying to move in because this is a huge smuggling route through here.\u201d Brent LeBar\u00f3n, whose aunt and cousins were killed in Monday\u2019s attack, said the first sign something was amiss came earlier this year, when American relatives traveling to a funeral in the region inadvertently drove through a cartel checkpoint \u2013 provoking a chase and a warning. Other warnings came \u201cthrough the grapevine\u201d, he said. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re fighting over turf and access to roads and getting their drugs to the border.\u201d This week\u2019s attack was not the first time the LeBar\u00f3n family had been targeted. A decade ago, a boy was kidnapped from the town of Colonia LeBar\u00f3n, which the family founded in Chihuahua. On that occasion, the family refused to pay a ransom and barricaded the town, forcing the captors to free the boy. But soon after, cartel henchmen returned and seized Benjam\u00edn LeBar\u00f3n \u2013 who had become prominent as an anti-crime activist \u2013 and his brother-in-law Luis Widmar. The two men were dragged from their homes and killed \u2013 but few in the family express regret that they stood up to the gunmen. \u201cIf you pay one, you\u2019re going to get 10 more. It was stance we had to take as a community,\u201d said Brent LeBar\u00f3n as he travelled to La Mora on Thursday for the victims\u2019 funerals. \u201cThat\u2019s why it got so much fame \u2026 because, hey, we\u2019re not going to stand for this. And if you can\u2019t protect us, then try to come in and take our farms or take us out of our farms.\u201d Such words reflect a frontier ethos influenced by the family\u2019s American roots \u2013 but also the fact most in the family are dual US-Mexican citizens. Brent LeBar\u00f3n acknowledged that in the past their status had made Mexican authorities more ready to react \u2013 \u201cit becomes a bigger problem with dual citizens being attacked.\u201d That was not the case on Monday, when it took police and army eight hours to reach the site of the attack. But in a country where victims\u2019 families usually remain silent for fear of retaliation \u2013 or stigmatized as somehow being complicit in the violence against them \u2013 the LeBar\u00f3ns and other Mormon families have made their voices heard. \u201cYes, death sucks, but we\u2019re not afraid of it and we\u2019re willing to defend what\u2019s ours: our rights and the right to life and happiness and the pursuit of it,\u201d said Brent LeBar\u00f3n. Despite the harsh surroundings, families in Mexico\u2019s Mormon colonies have prospered over the years. Many of the men work as roofers, framers and drywallers in the United States, then invest their earnings into pecan orchards and chili fields back in Mexico. But they trace their origins to 1876, when the Mormon prophet Brigham Young sent exploratory teams at a time the church was trying to escape US prohibitions on polygamy and evangelize in Mexico and Latin America, said Jeffrey Jones, a former Mexican senator and distant relative of a leader from the original expedition. Some of the community still belong to the official LDS church, though many still worship in unaffiliated congregations, said Brent LeBar\u00f3n, although he said the practice of polygamy is \u201cfading\u201d. The first settlers grew apples and peaches in nine colonies on the high plains \u2013 until the revolution of 1910 erupted. Revolutionary leaders ordered the settlers to disarm, prompting a mass exodus, said Jones \u2013 who resides on the same property in Colonia Dubl\u00e1n, the birthplace of George Romney, father of 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Some modern-day Mexican Mormons express similar fears of being unprotected in a country which has strict gun-control laws but is awash with illegal weapons. \u201cIf the Mexican government made it so a civilian could own a firearm, I truly believe all this stuff would calm down a lot quicker than anyone would realize,\u201d said Miller Jr. But another family member, Alex LeBar\u00f3n, pointed out that many of the weapons used in Mexico\u2019s raging drug wars come from north of the border. After Donald Trump tweeted \u201cyou sometimes need an army to defeat an army\u201d, he replied: \u201cWant to help some more? Stop the ATF and gun law loopholes from systematically injecting high-powered assault weapons to Mexico.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
