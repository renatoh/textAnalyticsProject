Overall, nine in 10 people on the planet live with poor, even dangerous, air, says the WHO report, which is considered the most comprehensive collection of global air quality data. But levels of contamination vary widely depending on government actions and financial resources. For the first time, the report included regional historic data, which showed that more than 57% of cities in the Americas and more than 61% of cities in Europe had seen a fall in PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter between 2010 and 2016. But these gains were set against a worsening trend in other regions. The most rapid deterioration was in south and south-east Asia, where more than 70% of poor cities suffered worsening air quality. The Middle East was also badly affected. Delhi and Cairo are by far the most polluted mega-cities in the world with average PM10 levels more than 10 times the WHO guidelines. They are followed by Dhaka, Mumbai and Beijing, each with particulate concentrations about five times the recommended level. The Americas, principally the US and Canada, was the only region where a sizeable majority of people \u2013 80% \u2013 breathe air that meets WHO guidelines on particulates. In Asia and the Middle East, the figure was close to zero. In terms of household air pollution, which contributed to 3.8m deaths, the gap is also wide because families in poorer nations are more dependent on burning wood, coal and kerosene for cooking and heating. Overall, the authors said the global annual death toll of 7 million is largely unchanged from the previous 2016 air pollution report by the WHO, despite growing awareness of the problem and government promises of action. \u201cThere are cities and regions where improvement is happening,\u201d said Sophie Gumy, one of the authors of the report. \u201cBut even if things have started to move, they aren\u2019t moving quickly enough. Seven million deaths is a totally unacceptable figure. The fact that 92% [of people] are still breathing unacceptable air is the news. Pollution remains at dangerously high levels.\u201d More than 90% of air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, followed by low- and middle-income countries of the eastern Mediterranean region, Europe and the Americas. Airborne contaminants from cars, factories, wood fires and other sources cause a quarter of fatal heart attacks and strokes, 29% of lung cancer deaths and 43% of mortalities from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the report shows. Reducing these risks depends on public awareness and political will, as well as income. The authors of the report praised China, which has tightened pollution controls in the wake of \u201cairpocalypse\u201d scandals, public protests and health concerns. \u201cOne of the reasons for that, is the health argument is strongly presented and citizens felt the link between air pollution and their own health,\u201d said Dr Maria Neira, director of public health at WHO. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see the same movement now in India, which is a country of particular concern.\u201d There are signs of progress from specific projects, such as India\u2019s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme which has provided 37 million women living below the poverty line with free liquified petroleum gas connections, and Mexico City, which has committed to cleaner vehicle standards. More cities are also measuring air quality, which is pushing the subject up the political agenda. But there is much to be done, even in wealthy nations with relatively progressive policies. The new data reveals 49 towns and cities in the UK \u2013 ranging from London and Manchester to Prestonpans and Eccles \u2013 are at or over WHO standards for PM2.5. Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said this showed the need for more research and stronger policies. \u201cAs more air quality data becomes available, we are uncovering a deeply concerning number of seemingly quaint, fresh aired places across the UK with dangerously polluted air,\u201d she said. WHO cautions that its data remains incomplete. More than 4,300 cities in 108 countries now provide ambient air quality information, a rise of more than 30% from 2016. This is supplemented by satellite, but there are relatively few data collection points in Africa, standards vary from country to country, yearly variations can be affected by climate, and there is currently little to distinguish between airborne sand from desert regions and toxic particulates in big cities. But the overall picture is clear. WHO says the threat remains enormous across the globe with the worst impacts hitting the poor. \u201cAir pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalised people bear the brunt of the burden,\u201d says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO. \u201cIt is unacceptable that over 3 billion people \u2013 most of them women and children \u2013 are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we don\u2019t take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development.\u201d As well as governments, WHO are encouraging individuals to do more to reduce air pollution with a campaign to promote greater use of public transport and bicycles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
