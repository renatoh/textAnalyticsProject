Since the director is Michael Bay of The Rock and Armageddon fame, it goes without saying that the bang bang works much better than the kiss kiss. Sadly, there's 90 minutes of our future heroes (the unmemorably interchangeable Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) growing up and meeting nurse Kate Beckinsale (far too classy for both lads and script). Cliches rain down as relentlessly as the Japanese bombs. Wince at anachronisms like \"She's totally buying it\", and at the drippy love letters exchanged once Affleck goes to England to fight with the RAF. A love triangle develops but Jules et Jim it ain't. Eventually Bay unleashes the attack on us, and very impressive it is, with planes bearing down like angry hornets. There's a middle 40 minutes with real impact before a sickly, quasi-religious ending. It's all terribly last century. Rashomon Retail (\u00a315.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99) BFI Cert 12 A notch below Kurosawa's later masterpieces, The Seven Samurai and Yojimbo (both available from BFI), Rashomon was the first film to alert the west to both the Japanese director and his manic star, Toshiro Mifune. As usual, Mifune's unhinged acting style is offset against the quiet dignity of Takashi Shimura, the Seven Samurai's leader, here playing a humble woodchopper. All Kurosawa's trademarks are here - frantic action, pouring rain, no-nonsense wipes and a compositional skill. Rashomon's theme - that there is no such thing as objective truth - is wittily demonstrated. There was a US remake (The Outrage) but its real heir is The Usual Suspects, whose director Bryan Singer cited it as a prime influence. Throne of Blood, Kurosawa's striking take on Macbeth, is also released on DVD."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
