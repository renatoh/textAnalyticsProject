The club have been supplied by Umbro since 2014 but exercised an option to change manufacturers after one year of their latest agreement. The Umbro deal had been worth \u00a34m-\u00a35m per year. In February Everton announced they would end their sponsorship agreement with the Kenyan betting firm SportPesa two years early. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s players will continue to wear SportPesa-sponsored Umbro kits for the duration of the 2019-20 campaign and change to Hummel, and a new sponsor, at the start of next season. Hummel will kit out the men\u2019s, women\u2019s and academy squads as well as Everton in the Community staff. \u201cIt is really important that we drive maximum value from our commercial deals and this is a club record deal for a technical partnership for Everton,\u201d said the chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale. \u201cWe have all been impressed with Hummel\u2019s originality, commitment to quality and vision to challenge expectations.\u201d Allan Vad Nielsen, Hummel\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cEntry into the Premier League is integral to our ambitious growth plans, international expansion and focus on sport. Timing is also perfect as it is the 50th anniversary of club legend Alan Ball introducing Hummel to the UK market with his legendary white boots.\u201d Despite securing a club-record kit deal, Everton\u2019s income from Hummel is dwarfed by the Premier League\u2019s biggest names. Manchester United, for example, earn \u00a375m a year from their kit deal with Adidas and Liverpool\u2019s new deal with Nike is estimated to be worth around \u00a380m a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
