The owners have reacted to the choice of a top barrister, Anthony Arlidge QC, to probe the Rotherham affair by engaging Stephen Hornsby, a specialist in sports law from the Simkins Partnership in London, to defend them and have been told it could be \"months\" before the case is resolved. Premier Rugby, the body representing the 12 Premiership clubs, says it is \"dismayed\" by the RFU's stance and, in a statement, stressed it would \"continue to vigorously deny these allegations\". The owners are particularly concerned that the RFU had seemingly already decided to appoint Arlidge before Tuesday's meeting between Premier Rugby representatives and Robert Horner, the union's disciplinary officer. One source described the meeting as \"a farce\" and Howard Thomas, Premier Rugby's chief executive, fears rugby's image will once again suffer as a consequence. \"It's hugely distracting for the game and the sort of advice we will now require does not come cheap,\" said Thomas. \"You'd be stupid to go in blind against a top QC. If they'd appointed Mr Jones of Dorset and Wilts it would have been another matter but this is a different kettle of fish.\" It is understood the club owners are also unhappy at being unable to see the detailed evidence against them. With many of them already questioning the wisdom of their investments in an uncertain financial climate, there is also rising frustration. \"When it comes to things like this, rugby union is a foot-shooter par excellence,\" claimed one. The RFU management board's confirmation that there will be automatic relegation this season has also depressed owners and players concerned at the implications for a club finishing bottom. London Irish's skipper Ryan Strudwick is among those calling for a more accommodating formula. \"There's no point London Irish going down next year and us winning all our games by 70-80 points,\" said Strudwick, who favours a two-leg play-off rather than automatic relegation. \"But if we went down, would London Irish still be a rugby club? The sad reality is we would probably lose our top international players, the side would fall apart and we'd end up staying there.\" Wales's nine premier clubs have cancelled their meeting today in which it was hoped they would come up with their answer to the proposal to revamp professional rugby on provincial lines. The club owners will meet tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
