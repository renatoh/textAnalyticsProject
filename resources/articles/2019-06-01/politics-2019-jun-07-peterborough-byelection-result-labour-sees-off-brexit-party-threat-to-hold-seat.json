The victorious Labour candidate, Lisa Forbes, told her supporters after the count early on Friday: \u201cTonight\u2019s result is significant because it shows that the politics of division will never win.\u201d Forbes won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party\u2019s Mike Greene, who took 9,801 votes, a margin of 683. The Conservatives were beaten into third place with 7,243 votes. Turnout was 48%. Farage left the count through a backdoor minutes before the result was announced. After the result, Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories had been pushed to the margins because of the government cuts and its disastrous handling of Brexit. \u201cThis result shows that in spite of the divisions and deadlock over Brexit, when it comes to a vote on the issues that directly affect people\u2019s lives, Labour\u2019s case for real change has strong support across the country. I look forward to welcoming Lisa to parliament next week,\u201d he said. Greene said the Brexit party had made a significant breakthrough, despite not winning. \u201cWe have shaken up British politics with none of the data that is necessary to win a parliamentary election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two parties ruling for decades, that\u2019s not happening any more.\u201d Speaking on Friday morning, Farage insisted his party had done well. \u201cWhichever way you cut it, we\u2019ve come from nowhere, produced a massive result,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite got over the line but we\u2019re pretty buoyed by this.\u201d He added: \u201cHere\u2019s the important thing \u2013 eight weeks ago today the Brexit party launched. And I think what you\u2019ve seen from this result last night is that British politics has fundamentally changed. It\u2019s no longer just two parties contesting.\u201d Farage said the relatively high Conservative vote was the key factor: \u201cThere are now seats like this, over the country, where voters are going to start to realise that if you vote Conservative you\u2019re going to finish up with a Corbyn government. Once that gets through we\u2019ll begin to see tactical voting.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, told BBC1\u2019s Breakfast that the party had \u201cwon against the odds, and I\u2019m absolutely delighted\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very good night for Labour. And there\u2019s really no other way to try to spin this. We were supposed to lose \u2013 we won.\u201d Stewart Jackson, the former Conservative MP for Peterborough, said the Tories suffered because of the failings of the parliamentary party. \u201cThere has been no leader and Brexit policy has been a shambles. Once we deliver Brexit, and get a new leader in place, I think this seat will be back in contention,\u201d he said. The Liberal Democrats came fourth in the byelection with 4,159 with the Greens fifth with 1,035 votes. Brexit party insiders said Labour\u2019s reliance upon a mainly Pakistani vote in inner-city wards had been the difference between the parties. Labour dismissed the theory a \u201cracist trope\u201d. The result is a setback for Farage\u2019s fledgling party, which argues for a no-deal departure from Europe and made a strong showing in last month\u2019s European elections, securing the largest share of the vote and winning 29 seats. This was the first Westminster constituency it has contested since it was founded four months ago. Although an opposition party is expected to win byelections, Labour was seeking victory in a seat where 60% of people voted to leave the EU. Labour activists acknowledged they also had to combat anger over the party\u2019s selection of Fiona Onasanya as its last candidate. She was forced to stand down following a recall petition after lying to police about a speeding ticket. The victory will help Corbyn in his fight with critics within the party who have tried to persuade the Labour leader to change course over Brexit. Shadow cabinet members such as Emily Thornberry have urged him to strongly campaign for a second referendum. Other senior figures, such as the party chair Ian Lavery, have argued that Labour will be decimated in parts of northern England and Wales if it attempts to run another referendum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
