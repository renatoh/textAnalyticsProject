Emre Can was just coming to the end of a chat with the Sunday newspapers when a routine question about winning back his place in the Germany squad caught him slightly off guard. L\u00f6w had only just made his announcement. \u201cI\u2019m not in there? Maybe the manager will call me or send me a message. Of course I want to get back into the Germany squad.\u201d Apologies, Emre. No one likes to be the bearer of bad tidings, however unintentionally. The Liverpool midfielder was in the Germany squad for Euro 2016 but a combination of missing much of pre-season and picking up an early injury led to him losing his place at Anfield. Can was so immense towards the end of last season it was hard to imagine J\u00fcrgen Klopp doing anything else but building a side round him \u2013 he has often been described as the next Steven Gerrard \u2013 though it is equally important to remember he is 22 and still picking up experience. \u201cIt is very nice to be compared to Steven Gerrard but I know I am not at the same level,\u201d Can says with refreshing candour. \u201cThere is a long way to go there. I am trying to score more goals for a start. It is something I want to do. Last weekend I scored my first goal of the season but I had chances against Manchester United and West Brom and didn\u2019t take them. My target is to score more goals, not necessarily be the next Steven Gerrard. Obviously my respect for him is very high but I want to go my own way. I want to be Emre Can, not copy other players.\u201d Can was on Merseyside long before his compatriot Klopp arrived and, though the pair appeared to strike up a bond almost immediately, the player confirms he knew little about Klopp before they started working together. \u201cWe can talk in German now, he always says nice things about me, but to be honest I didn\u2019t know too much about him,\u201d Can says. \u201cI played against his Dortmund team twice but I didn\u2019t know him personally. I suppose I knew he had a reputation for being a little bit crazy and now I can see that\u2019s true, but only in a positive way. That\u2019s how he is. \u201cThe main thing I remember from the Bundesliga is that it was never nice to play against his teams. They counterpressed, they made it hard for their opponents. If you had the ball, you would know the opponent was already coming and you would have to play it quickly. That is what I think teams are thinking when they have to play Liverpool now. If teams come to Anfield, I don\u2019t think they will be expecting to get an easy game. \u201cI remember the manager saying in pre-season that the target was to be the fittest team in the league. If you look at the statistics, we are the best for high intensity. We run a lot of kilometres. It takes time to adapt to the playing style that the manager wants but he has been here a year now, we know exactly what he wants us to do and so far it seems to be working.\u201d Watford are the next team to put that theory to the test, the same Watford who beat Liverpool 3-0 at Vicarage Road last season and sit comfortably in the top half of the Premier League table. \u201cEvery year in the Premier League every team is improving,\u201d Can says. \u201cEvery team is buying new players. We bought new players as well, some very good ones, but I think the competition here is tougher than it is in Germany. In the Bundesliga you have Bayern Munich and then Dortmund and they win it every year. In Germany it is difficult to imagine a team like Leicester City winning the title. I always say the Premier League is the best in the world and I still feel it is an honour to be playing here but I think English football suits my game. Football is more physical here, the ref is not whistling every foul. I think it is better like that. It is good for me anyway. I think the game might be quicker here as well.\u201d Can need no longer feel quite as alone in his admiration of English football. At the last count there were a couple of dozen Germans plying their trade in the Premier League. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see other Germans in this country but I didn\u2019t know there were that many.\u201d One compatriot Can will not be bumping into is Bastian Schweinsteiger, a national hero in Germany but frozen out at Manchester United. Can sympathises, having known Schweinsteiger at Bayern Munich as well as within the national squad. \u201cI know Bastian very well, he\u2019s a very good guy. He\u2019s more than that actually, I think you can say he\u2019s a legend. I don\u2019t know what has happened at Manchester United and I don\u2019t understand the reasons, but I don\u2019t think they can have too much respect for him. \u201cIt is a pity, because he is a great guy, someone who worked hard and is always a gentleman. When I came up into the first team at Bayern he was the first one who said if you need something come to me, and that was a big help.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
