At more than 600 pages, her book could last (and enhance) a fortnight, which only goes to show that successful summer reading must start with painful selection. Pack Mantel, and there will be less time for any of the other contenders for poolside or mountaintop reading suggested, dauntingly, at this time of year. The Guardian Review's list alone offered 25 fiction and poetry titles (led by Wolf Hall), 10 children's books and 24 works of non-fiction (led by Leviathan, Philip Hoare's enthralling worship of whales). The Tory MP and historian Keith Simpson has set his colleagues a demanding list, too, with 26 non-fiction titles, starting with Patrick Hennessey's stunning description of life as a Guards officer in Afghanistan, The Junior Officers' Reading Club. It must be the first account of war to include a photograph of the London Review of Books. Simpson's list gets trickier; several titles on it are not published until the autumn and (important though it is) Nigel White's Democracy Goes to War: British Military Deployments under International Law might be hard going after a lunchtime bottle of ros\u00e9. The temptation is to flee to the comforts of the trashy novel that will begin David Cameron's holiday (or the Harry Potter that Gordon Brown claimed he would read in 2007). Better to stick to the serious: but pick carefully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
