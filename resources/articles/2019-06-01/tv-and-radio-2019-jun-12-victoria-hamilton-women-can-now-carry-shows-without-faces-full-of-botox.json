I wouldn\u2019t have recognised her from The Crown, in which she plays the Queen Mother, even though she swears they did nothing to her appearance \u2013 except make her wear \u201ca swimsuit that had tits built into my stomach. Then they\u2019d take all my makeup off and put a grey wig on my head.\u201d I would have recognised her from Deep State, because I\u2019d only just watched an episode: a hot, gory spy drama, paranoid and nail-biting. But really I recognise her because I feel like I already know her from all her great theatre roles and countless period dramas, from Scoop to Mansfield Park. Fantastically warm and funny, Hamilton brings a huge amount to a conversation with just eyebrows and intonation. When we talk about The Crown, the acclaimed Netflix series about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, I mention that it can\u2019t have sounded like a very interesting proposition: just a bunch of rich, repressed people doing what they\u2019re told. \u201cHonestly,\u201d she says, \u201cmost actors\u2019 first thought was, \u2018Really, really? More royalty. Really? Really? The Queen Mother? Really?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s like a masterclass in how many different ways there are to say \u201creally\u201d in a sceptical and unenthusiastic voice. In the Fox series Deep State, she plays a gay Republican senator facing a cover-up as she investigates the deaths of special forces agents in Mali. \u201cIt\u2019s very pertinent,\u201d she says. \u201cThis sense that there are decisions being made and we have no idea who\u2019s making them, conflicts being funded for agendas we have no clue about.\u201d As for her part, she says: \u201cI think there\u2019s never been a better time to be an actress over 40. They really are starting to write fully rounded protagonist roles for women who aren\u2019t 35. I never thought, at 48, I\u2019d be doing a job that had a love story written into it. If you\u2019d told me that 10 years ago, my jaw would have been on the floor. Your fuckability quotient \u2013 wait, you can\u2019t put that in an article.\u201d Can\u2019t I? \u201cOh, go on then. It started to happen with The Killing and Borgen, where not only were women carrying shows, they didn\u2019t have a face full of Botox and weren\u2019t pneumatic-looking. And the sexuality of those women was suddenly real. Real bodies and real people and it\u2019s 100 times sexier than the sex scenes that we\u2019ve all been watching for decades, faked and airbrushed and boring.\u201d Theatre aside, it\u2019s only recently that Hamilton has been cast as a character who wasn\u2019t incredibly sweet. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the sort of face I\u2019ve got \u2013 in film, the personality of your face gets cast, instead of necessarily what\u2019s inside. That\u2019s why I spent the first 10 years of my career in theatre, and still constantly go back. The roles have more depth. There\u2019s a wonderful thing that happens where someone can hit the stage and, within half an hour, you think that is the ugliest or the most beautiful person you\u2019ve ever seen. Whatever stage energy you\u2019ve chosen to give to that character is more important than what you look like.\u201d She adds: \u201cAlso, most theatre isn\u2019t shit. And quite a lot of telly is shit. Or was, until a few years ago. This is a hugely highfalutin conversation. \u2018Why do you love theatre?\u2019 \u2018Because it\u2019s not shit.\u2019\u201d The Crown was much more daring at first than it seems, now that it\u2019s been so successful: not for each individual actor so much as the whole thing, and how awesomely expensive it was. This, it turns out, was down to executive producer Stephen Daldry. \u201cBasically, Stephen was trying to create a hybrid between TV and film, holding out for those extraordinary budgets. So in a strange way, much as doing the second series was wonderful, once it had this big stamp of approval, it felt less exciting, because it wasn\u2019t going to fail on that epic scale.\u201d She seems entranced by the spectacle of disaster, the randomness and absurdity of what works and what doesn\u2019t. \u201cOh, it\u2019s only romantic when you\u2019ve got a job. Doing that backslapping thing, \u2018We\u2019re so brave, this is so romantic.\u2019\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really look the way I am,\u201d Hamilton says, though she\u2019s just said she looks like an \u201celf with tits\u201d, and it\u2019s difficult to know how that would be. She\u2019s never been cast in a successful comedy, which is odd because, conversationally, she is funny \u2013 witty, caustic and surreal. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be funny if you look a certain way. If you then play a part that has a lot of gravitas and darkness, you\u2019re something else and it\u2019s hard to get back. If anyone finds you sexy, you can\u2019t be sexy and funny. Because of course you can\u2019t laugh and have a hard-on at the same time.\u201d There\u2019s a pause while we both consider this. \u201cActually, that is true, you can\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d love another series of Deep State. She wants to do a one-woman show. She has a TV series she can\u2019t talk about that takes her to October, an unprecedented run, she says, of gainful employment. While acclaim came pretty fast for Hamilton\u2019s work on stage, it was always precarious. \u201cAlmost every time in my career, when I\u2019ve done something and people have gone \u2018well, that\u2019s it\u2019, whether it\u2019s winning a prize or whatever, I genuinely then have not worked for a really long time afterwards.\u201d Descriptions of her career are shot through with insecurity, long bouts of unemployment. Her husband, Mark Bazeley, is also an actor. \u201cWhen neither of us is working, we just cry, drink a lot of wine, and really, really worry.\u201d She pauses and adds: \u201cIt pisses me off so much. People get up to accept awards, and talk about acting, and say, \u2018We\u2019re all so spoilt.\u2019 No we\u2019re not: 98% of actors are struggling to pay the rent or the mortgage, and wondering where the next part is coming from.\u201d She may be being a little too modest, when in fact there has been considerable deliberation in her career, a lot of careful choices. She talks about taking A Day in the Death of Joe Egg to Broadway with Eddie Izzard in 2003. \u201cIt went really well and got nominated for Tonys. I had all of New York saying, \u2018You\u2019ve to go to LA.\u2019 I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m glad \u2013 and the reason is that I would have been completely destroyed. If you didn\u2019t look like Cameron Diaz, you would get slaughtered and end up doing work you didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d And as a result, she is not especially famous: \u201cReal fame is if you can\u2019t get on the tube. All I get is people squinting at me, which on a vulnerable day is very odd. You\u2019ve walked around London and people have just frowned at you, as if they slightly disapprove of you.\u201d But then, on the other hand, there\u2019s a body of work that has range, that\u2019s been memorable \u2013 and never trivial. \u2022 Deep State is on Fox in the UK at 9pm on Thursdays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
