The defeat at the hands of the 10 men of Anderlecht last time out has opened up Group A but with the leaders Bayern Munich due at Parkhead on November 25, ahead of Celtic's trip to Lyon next month, O'Neill feels that a minimum of six points are needed to reach the knockout stages. \"We probably have to win against Anderlecht although I am sure that it wouldn't be the death-knell to our aspirations if we draw,\" he said. \"If we lost then it would cast a major shadow on our chances and it will probably depend on what happens elsewhere if we draw. But we still have to be looking at winning two of the last three games to give ourselves any sort of chance.\" Celtic's last home defeat was in a Champions League qualifier against Ajax in 2001 and though they have avoided defeat at home in 12 European ties since, O'Neill does not feel that the record gives them an edge, quite the reverse in fact. \"Records are a sometimes a cause of worry,\" he said. \"Ours at Celtic Park in European games is terrific, but it's not because of a fluke but the exceptional hard work of the players. It doesn't just mean we can turn up and win football matches, People at Real Madrid, Old Trafford and the San Siro don't do that.\" Two of O'Neill's preferred midfield will be absent this evening, the injured Alan Thompson and Paul Lambert,, but Celtic are still able to field a strong side with the Irish midfielder Liam Miller, scorer of the first in their 2-0 win against Lyon, fit after suffering a bout of cramp in Saturday's 5-0 win at Kilmarnock. Didier Agathe is also available after being rested at Rugby Park, Joos Valgaeren is back after recovering from a virus, while Johan Mjallby (knee), Steve Guppy (hernia), Jamie Smith (ankle) and Ulrik Laursen (ligament) are also available for selection as is Michael Gray, on loan from Sunderland. \"The players are confident but there is no margin for error,\" said Valgaeren, who singled out Aruna Dindane, scorer of the winner at the Constant Vanden Stock stadium, as the main danger. \"He is quite a complete player and he is a big concern for us,\" he said. \"Even though we had most of the game in Belgium and had a lot of the ball in midfield with the extra man, he caused us lots of problems and they had some opportunities. \"We have a good record [at home] but we can't depend on that\" Anderlecht, 11 points clear in their league, will be without Glen de Boeck, suspended for his red card that night so Hannu Tihinen, once of West Ham, will probably play alongside Vincent Kompany. The 17-year-old has only featured intermittently for four months but already he has been included in the Belgium squad, hailed as the best player Anderlecht have produced since Paul van Himst and, almost inevitably, attracted attention from Manchester United, Arsenal and Serie A, although he signed a new contract last week which keeps him at the club until 2006. \"I have never worked with a player of this talent,\" said the coach Hugo Broos after the teenager single-handedly dealt with Larsson and John Hartson after De Boek was sent off. O'Neill considers that performance to be Celtic's worst of the season but since then they have built up a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League. \"We will still have to play as well as we did against Lyon to win,\" he mused."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
