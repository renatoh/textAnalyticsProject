The winger can leave Chelsea on a free transfer next summer and his future remains uncertain, even though Frank Lampard has made it clear he wants to keep the 31-year-old. Willian, who is entitled to start talking to other clubs in January, is eager to begin negotiations over an extension and he said it was down to the club to present him with fresh terms. \u201cI feel happy here,\u201d the Brazilian said. \u201cI feel happy to play for this club but the situation is not in my hands. It\u2019s in their hands. I\u2019m waiting for them. They know what I want, what I want to do, so I wait for them.\u201d Willian, who has scored three goals this season, said he would not put pressure on Chelsea by speaking to other clubs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to them because I have a contract until the end of the season. I am a Chelsea player but I just want to say the club know what I want to do.\u201d Willian, a \u00a332m signing from Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013, said Chelsea were fortunate to draw 2-2 with Valencia in the Champions League on Wednesday. They defended badly at Mestalla but they will qualify for the last 16 if they win their final game in Group H, at home against Lille on 10 December, regardless of what happens when Valencia visit Ajax. \u201cThe end of the game was crazy and it\u2019s difficult to play at Valencia with the atmosphere,\u201d Willian said. \u201cAt least we got a point and now we have a decider at home. I think we got a little bit lucky but it was like this so now we go to the game against Lille.\u201d Marcos Alonso also faces an uncertain future at Chelsea. The 28-year-old left-back did not travel to Valencia and could be up for sale next summer. Chelsea are looking at signing a left-back and have targeted Leicester City\u2019s Ben Chilwell, 22, who has also been linked with Manchester City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
