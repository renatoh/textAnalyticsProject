As if worries over their captain's fitness were not bad enough, the Irish are now digesting the news that 3,000 bar staff are contemplating a strike during the World Cup. A dry Dublin would be a strange place, but a pay dispute led to the same happening during USA '94. There is good reason for the Irish to be celebrating, however, because Manchester United are now reporting that Keane will be out for only four weeks. \"If that is the case he will be fine,\" said Mick McCarthy. \"I've no need to chase after anybody, but Roy has told [the physiotherapist] Mick Byrne he will let us know if he is fit or not.\" In Keane's absence, Coventry's Gary Breen will captain an experimental Republic side against the US tonight. The Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy, struggling against a spate of injuries that has so far ruled out 12 players, yesterday called up the 20-year-old Rochdale striker Lee McEvilly. \"One or two people out and you would say OK and that's average,\" he said. \"But I've got 12 out and you're asking young players to come in and do a job. I look at our bench and it's going to be like a kindergarten.\" Spain have injury worries of their own after Diego Tristan, the top scorer in the Primera Division this season, limped out of training yesterday with a thigh strain. Ronaldo will play one half for Brazil against Portugal in Lisbon this evening, having scored twice for Internazionale on Sunday in his first league start this year. Tonight's friendly between Denmark and Israel will go ahead despite a written bomb threat and three planned demonstrations against the occupation of the West Bank. Republic of Ireland (4-4-2): Given (Newcastle); Finnan (Fulham), O'Brien (Newcastle), Breen (Coventry), Harte (Leeds); Delap (Southampton), Kinsella (Charlton), Healy (Preston), Kilbane (Sunderland); Duff (Blackburn), Keane (Leeds). US (probable, 4-4-2): Friedel; Sanneh, Pope, Agoos, Berhalter; Stewart, Reyna, Armas, O'Brien; Mathis, McBride. Referee: P Leuba (Switzerland)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
