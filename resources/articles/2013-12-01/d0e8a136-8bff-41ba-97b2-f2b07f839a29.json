Wenger again accused Everton, after the 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, of adopting an overly physical approach, claiming: \"When we got out of the pressure and got into the passing, they stopped us every single time with a foul.\" But Mart\u00ednez believes his Arsenal counterpart was merely frustrated, having been outplayed in the first half and unable to extend his lead at the top of the Premier League. The Everton manager responded: \"I see it is a compliment. When you're top of the league and have the chance to extend your lead because of results of the previous day, the disappointment is there to be seen. When you get a team that stops you doing what you want because of defending, being negative and kicking, well we never did that. We had 63% of the possession in the first half. We were very composed in what we were doing and in control of the game. \"We ended up giving away 11 free-kicks, Arsenal gave away 13, so the stats settle any sort of argument on that. But I respect Ars\u00e8ne Wenger too much and I understand sometimes you're caught up in the emotion of the game. We want to be good on the ball but that doesn't mean we are not going to work hard off it. I was very, very pleased in the manner we did that.\" Following a hugely encouraging week on their travels at Manchester United and Arsenal, Everton host third-from-bottom Fulham at Goodison Park on Saturday. But Mart\u00ednez is anxious to avoid complacency creeping in against a team keen to impress their new manager, Rene Meulensteen. \"The timing is very dangerous for us,\" warned the Everton manager. \"We are coming from a real high of The Emirates and Old Trafford and people might think it should be an easy win for the home side. But believe me, Fulham are not the third team from the bottom of this league. I don't think this team is going to be any less difficult than the difficult teams we have faced this season. I really believe that. I will not accept us dropping our standards. We have to be very wary of that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
