The Aston Villa manager, whose international players could feature in more than 60 games for club and country this season, believes there is widespread support among his contemporaries for a weekend of respite in the domestic calendar. O'Neill pointed to the Bundesliga, which has introduced a six-week mid-season break, as evidence that the initiative is viable and said that, while he would not expect the Premier League to welcome a similar hiatus, one weekend free of competitive fixtures in January could make a significant difference to the players. The Scottish Premier League experimented with the idea for a period when O'Neill was managing at Celtic Park and he claimed it was no coincidence he took the club to the Uefa Cup final during that time. \"We only had it for two years [while I was at Celtic] but the mid-term break was very beneficial and I would be a great advocate of it here, even if it ended up missing only one particular weekend,\" said O'Neill, who was today ruing the Uefa Cup draw which paired Villa against CSKA Moscow in the knock-out stages of the tournament. \"I'm quite sure that among managers, if they had any say, there would be decent support for it. I couldn't see very many people objecting. \"I believe it would give everyone a lift in January. For myself it would be nice to get a chance [to take a break] but really it's for players who are at it all the time. Remember some of our players will be involved in the Under-21 [European Championships] so that's all summer taken up and apparently they're going to start next season earlier because Fabio Capello needs longer before the World Cup. Eventually international players just do not get a chance [for a break] and they're burnt out.\" In some ways Villa's problems are self-inflicted, with the club qualifying for the Uefa Cup after applying to enter the Intertoto in July and O'Neill, Wednesday's defeat in Hamburg aside, usually selecting the same starting XI. O'Neill accepts \"there is going to be an element of fatigue at some stage\" because of Villa's extended season and he fears that those clubs competing in the Uefa Cup who have enjoyed a winter recess will gain \"an advantage come the back end of the season\". CSKA, Villa's opponents in the last 32, could well be one of those. O'Neill claimed that the draw \"couldn't have been much worse\" but gave little thought to the possibility of meeting Tottenham Hotspur in the last 16 because of the threat the Russian side posed. \"I think it will be exceptionally difficult,\" he said. \"They won all four games in their group, they're flying and I think it's a plastic pitch [away]. I'm sure there were probably easier ties.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
