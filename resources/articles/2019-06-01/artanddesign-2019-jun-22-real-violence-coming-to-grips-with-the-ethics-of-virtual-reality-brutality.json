The photo is a gleeful post from Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The caption reads: \u201cTony Ferguson\u2019s last seven opponents.\u201d My Instagram feed is full of pictures of violence, interspersed with advertisements for butt-enhancing leggings. They are \u201cinspo\u201d pictures, because I\u2019m interested in martial arts. To me, a pulpy face is a sign of peak fitness. That\u2019s the personal context I bring to it. It\u2019s a 2D taster of what I\u2019m later going to see in virtual reality form: Jordan Wolfson\u2019s Real Violence, one of two violent VR installations at Tasmania\u2019s midwinter arts festival, Dark Mofo. This is a two-minute street scene in which the artist himself is rendered virtual and repeatedly stomps on and takes a baseball bat to the head of a defenceless man. People sat in passing cars don\u2019t even turn their heads to look. Only you, in your headset, and you\u2019re not stepping in to help either. Perhaps there is more than one way to view the experience. I wonder, for example, if using VR to watch violence might be comparable to choosing to read details of violence in the news. It\u2019s a very human response to imagine the worst. We gauge how much we personally could endure and what death might feel like when it comes. But then, Wolfson has titled his work unambiguously. As he put it to Art News, \u201cYou might say to me, how is this real violence if it\u2019s fake? The real violence isn\u2019t depicted by the person suffering. The real violence is actually depicted by the person implementing the violence. And that\u2019s me.\u201d He seems to be implying that by watching Real Violence we are endorsing a graphically violent act. The man Wolfson beat to near-death does not exist, but by putting on the headset we are complicit in deriving a thrill from it. Back in 2005, Senator Hillary Clinton waged a war on violent video games, holding a press conference to propose a bill called the Family Entertainment Protection Act, which would criminalise selling violent games to children. To follow Clinton\u2019s logic that violent games breed violent actions, experiencing a game in VR mode should, in theory, be far more extreme (although, as reviewers of consumer games point out, technology isn\u2019t really up to speed yet so at this point the standard mode is more realistic). Philosophy professor Thomas Metzinger, of Johannes Gutenberg University, warned New Scientist that fully immersive experiences have a bigger and more lasting impact on behaviour and psychology, including depersonalisation. And a 2014 study from Portugal found that unpleasant stimuli activated the right amygdala \u2013 associated with negative emotion \u2013 more strongly when presented in 3D than in 2D. If I\u2019m honest, when watching Real Violence I was hoping to see the victim\u2019s eyeballs shoot out, but they did not. My reasoning was: in for a penny, in for a pound. More genuinely disturbing to me was Paul McCarthy\u2019s CSSC Coach Stage Stage Coach VR experiment: Mary and Eve, a sexual psychodrama with an American western vibe. Before donning the headset, participants are asked if they\u2019re OK with scenes of child sex abuse. Mary is a young woman, and Eve a young girl. The pair start to duplicate until the viewer is surrounded by them. At first, Eve is the target of Mary\u2019s malevolence, the kind of harassment that men might target a lone woman with. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d \u201cFuck you, Eve.\u201d Then the pair turn on the viewer and begin to crowd in. \u201cShe asked you a simple fucking question! Answer the fucking question!\u201d Turning away from one looming figure reveals another face, close up behind. There is violence of a sort \u2013 Mary simulates the rape of Eve through their clothing \u2013 but more unnerving is the implied violence. In Wolfson\u2019s Real Violence you are the observer. Here, the sense of threat is absorbed by you. Both artists have previously explored these very different perspectives of violence, and oddly, both used puppets. One of Wolfson\u2019s works, Colored Sculpture, was an animatronic boy viciously yanked by its chains around spaces like the Tate Modern. Wolfson told the Guardian, an echo of what he told Art News about Real Violence, \u201cThis is real abuse, not a simulation.\u201d In McCarthy\u2019s Pinocchio Pipenose Household Dilemma, the artist dresses as Pinocchio and slams around the set angrily, before committing violence against another Pinocchio. The viewer watches on video through an interface in their own Pinocchio mask. Context is everything. VR-induced discomfort has proven to be a useful therapeutic tool, not only in terms of exposure therapy \u2013 such as OCD sufferers who experience escalating anxiety based on their fears around dirt and disorder, in a safe environment \u2013 but also in promoting empathy. One 2018 study, for example, put domestic violence offenders in the virtual shoes of victims. Results revealed that offenders have a significantly lower ability to recognise fear in female faces compared to the general population, but after they were embodied in a female victim, this was reduced. Perhaps watching violence can also be a useful outlet, even when masquerading as entertainment. I ask Melbourne hardcore wrestler KrackerJak about this. His death-matches utilise props such as staple guns, box-cutters, barbed wire and baseball bats. The outcome is predetermined, but the audience is there to get its jollies from nasty-looking violence. He says it\u2019s a way for him to let off steam, too. \u201cI used to think it was cathartic,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019ve read some stuff where they say that engaging in that behaviour just reinforces the neural pathways that in turn reinforce your capacity to get angry or violent. Now I think it\u2019s playing around in an area of my mind that is easier to get to the more I do it. But it feels so fucking good.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July to remove a still from Jordan Wolfson\u2019s Real Violence"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
