Rank outsiders before the event, the young, strong and ambitious Chinese team, none of whose members is currently rated even in the top 50, had somehow coalesced into a unit hugely stronger than the sum of its parts; and in the first seven rounds swept away all before it. As reported last week they did have a great start with 4-0 against their Women's team. The bye in round two might have slowed their momentum but they immediately made a massive 3.5 - 0.5 against Cuba in round 3 and went on to score (not in order) two more 3.5-0.5 victories against Georgia and the USA and 2.5-1.5 against Israel and Ukraine. The big win against the USA was in round seven, while the Russians had their bye and left China a whole four points clear of the Russians with just two matches to go. But the Chinese stumbled for the first time when they lost 1.5-2.5 to Armenia; and despite Alexander Rublevsky losing to Shen Yang, who at 2326 is rated more than 300 points less than him, the gap did close to 2.5 points so that Russia now needed an immense 3.5-0.5 in the final round to overtake China. On board one, Bu Xiangzhi forced an early draw with Peter Svidler but Evgeny Bareev downed Zhang Zhong and a little later Alexander Grischuk defeated Zhang Pengxiang leaving just Alexander Morozevich in play with a big advantage against Ni Hua. Morozevich allowed the merest hint of mess but quickly regained control and took the full point. The final scores were Russia 22/32 game points and 16/16 match points China 21.5 (12), Armenia 18.5 (11), Ukraine 17.5 (9), USA 16.5 (8), Israel 14.5 (5), Georgia 13.5 (5), Cuba 13 (5) and China Women 7 (1). Despite the Russians' narrow victory, I'm concentrating today on the Chinese. Our form of Western Chess only took root in China from 1980 onwards and while the Chinese Women are already a world force, with two past world champions - Xie Jun twice and Zhu Chen - and victory at several Women's Olympiads, this is the first time that their Men's team has performed at anything like this level. Their players have long since progressed beyond being a homogenous group: but acting in concert, as they were in Beersheva, there were still clear shared characteristics. They are all generally very active players and display tenacity - fighting to the last drop of blood - and combativeness: the whole underpinned by lethal tactical awareness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
