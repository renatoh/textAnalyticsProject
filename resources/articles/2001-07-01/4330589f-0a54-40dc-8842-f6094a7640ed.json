She is from Nigeria, a country that has slipped from musical fashion in the West since the days of Fela Kuti, and she has two great claims to fame. Not only is she a heroine to many women because of her lyrics, which are highly critical of the way they have been treated by their men, but she has popularised a new style of Yoruba music, heavily influenced by traditional songs and dominated by thunderous drumming, which of course never swamps her even more gutsy vocals. Back home she is a celebrity - her last Lagos show was before a crowd of 100,000 - but her first-ever British concert was a rather less grand affair. Her percussive band may have fitted neatly into the line-up for the current South Bank Rhythm Sticks festival, but the QEH was not full, and provided an over-formal setting for what was essentially good-time dance music with a message. Not that Queen Salawa or her band seemed to worry. They came on stage one by one, banging away first at talking drums, then congas, drum-kit and a whole array of small traditional drums, until nine percussionists were building up rhythms and cross-rhythms, helped along by bass, saxophone and keyboards. Then Salawa arrived, flanked by two male singers, treating the affair as a cross between a party and large-scale local festival. An imposing but easy-going figure, she sang while seated on the floor, while wandering out among the crowd or while dancing with her back to the audience and engaging in some quite remarkable wiggling contortions. Her set included a few pop songs but consisted mostly of rousing, improvised, call-and-response work-outs with her singers, driven by relentless but subtle percussion that would have sounded even better in a dancehall. Then, right at the end, she showed there was another side to her work. Called back for an encore, she demonstrated the full range of her voice on an exceptional unaccompanied piece that was marked by sudden shifts in mood and pace, and sounded as spontaneous as a conversation, complete with passages where she was clearly laying down the law. The drummers are her trademark, but she is still powerful without them. Queen Elizabeth Hall"}, "isHosted": false}}}
