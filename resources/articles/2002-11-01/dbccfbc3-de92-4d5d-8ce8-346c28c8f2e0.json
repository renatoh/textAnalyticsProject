The show, which begins on November 20 and will run for 10 days, will feature six as yet unnamed celebrities. Last year, viewers were treated to the spectable Jack Dee trying to escape and Vanessa Feltz having a minor breakdown and the show resurrected the career of former Brookside star Claire Sweeney. BT Broadband will supply 24-hour coverage of the housemates and has developed special desktop software that will update office workers with the latest scenes from the house whenever something of particular interest occurs. Big Brother's online element is becoming increasingly important. Recent research showed fans of Big Brother 3 spent three-and-half hours a week on average watching the action on computers at home and work. Sponsorship credits will feature characters from the current \u00a310m marketing campaign for BT's \"no-frills\" broadband product. BT has vowed to hook up 5 million broadband customers by 2006. It has recently been attacked rivals, such as Freeserve, for taking advantage of its dominant position in the telephone market to sell broadband to its existing customers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
