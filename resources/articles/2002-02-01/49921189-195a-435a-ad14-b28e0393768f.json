The accusation against Haringey council came in a scathing attack on child protection in Britain by Francis Climbi\u00e9 and his wife Berthe Amoissi. Child protection agencies hold power without responsibility as \"the higher people get up the ladder, the more they are paid and the less they admit\", they argued. In their closing statement to the inquiry read by lawyer Margo Boye, the couple singled out Gurbux Singh, Haringey's former chief executive and now the head of the commission for racial equality, for the \"very disturbing and disappointing\" way in which he distanced himself from blame. \"A hell of a lot more should have been said about responsibility because at the heart of their case is that key people charged with the responsibility of ensuring Victoria's safety and welfare simply did not do their jobs,\" said Ms Boye. The couple also attacked the London borough for its \"insensitive and disrespectful\" claim that they had \"given Victoria away without so much as a forwarding address\". Victoria, whom they described as their \"precious daughter\", was sent from their home in the Ivory Coast to Europe under the care of her great aunt Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Kouao for a better education - a regular occurrence in the black community. Ignorance of this tradition was particularly alarming because many of Haringey's clients are black, the couple said. \"It suggests lack of knowledge of a practice which they [Victoria's parents] understand to be common in the black community as a whole,\" said Ms Boye. \"Victoria's parents were therefore fearful that like their daughter they too would be judged by people who clearly had no awareness or regard to the cultural background from whence she came, and it would seem the wider practice of the extended family bringing up and educating relatives.\" The couple claimed Victoria's needs were totally overlooked by all the agencies involved in her case despite, in the words of one social worker, her looking like \"an ActionAid poster\". They said the only people who recognised the danger she was in and tried to tackle it were untrained members of the public - unlike the professionals they took a \"common sense\" approach to Victoria's abuse, neglect and torture. Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao through marriage, is said to have twice phoned Brent social services in June 1999 warning that Victoria's life was in danger. The call was not immediately acted upon. A month later Victoria's childminder Priscilla Cameron and her daughter Avril took her to hospital after noticing scars covering her body, most of which were diagnosed as the skin infection scabies rather than deliberate injuries. \"It is regrettable that the most that was done for Victoria was done by those who were not paid or trained to protect her,\" Ms Boye said. Victoria's parents believe that members of the public may be deterred from trying to make crucial tip-offs like Mrs Ackah's by Brent council's longstanding denial that she ever made the calls. They also criticised Britain's multi-agency approach to child protection, arguing that police and social services have given undue deference to a consultant paediatrician's diagnosis without making their own independent analysis. \"What [the police] did do was led by social services who in turn were led by health so effectively officers in both child protection teams were being directed at best by secondhand unverified information,\" said Ms Boye. She said Victoria's parents were also shocked to discover that Carole Baptiste, the Haringey social work manager originally responsible for supervising their daughter's case, had her own child removed from her care. \"To them this is akin to discovering that police officers all have previous convictions,\" said the lawyer. The couple had been horrified by the chaotic management in the North Tottenham social services office that dealt with their daughter. Ms Baptiste, a born again Christian, was known to talk about religion and her experiences as a black woman rather than child protection cases. \"This is truly bizarre, witchcraft in one corner and a religious fanatic in the other and in the middle absolutely nobody reading a file,\" said Ms Boye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
