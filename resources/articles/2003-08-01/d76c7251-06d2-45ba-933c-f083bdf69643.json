However, if it is a win they want they will surely have to offer a small bunch of carrots to Yorkshire, on a wicket which is holding up just a little too well. Michael Vaughan, who has toiled through all of three championship games this season, suggests that country cricket encourages complacency. He was clearly out of earshot of his team-mates, whose exhortations echoed around Colwyn Bay. And there was no more enthusiastic skirmisher than Steve Kirby. In the late afternoon he marched back to his mark ready to bowl but the captain Anthony McGrath, noting that the umpires were fidgeting with their light meters, gave the ball to Andy Gray. Kirby strode to mid-on, shouting and clapping. \"This is our time, lads. Come on!\" he bellowed optimistically as Glamorgan's lead mounted. Immediately Michael Powell, in wonderful form, drove the ball hard to Kirby's right. The fielder dived and crashed down on his elbow, his legs quivering in pain like a doomed Grand National runner. The next man in, Robert Croft, joined the circle of mourners, and it took five minutes to ease Kirby from the field. He was laid out on the billiard table, an Agatha Christie touch, but no dislocation or fracture was found and within nine overs he was back at mid-on, shouting his head off. Complacent? Kirby is like John Cleese's medieval knight, roaring defiance as his body is hacked apart. When Yorkshire resumed in the morning Matthew Wood's core innings soon ended, pushing uncertainly at Croft, and the nightwatchman Kirby followed. That the visitors conceded only 44 on first innings was then down to a seventh-wicket stand of 73 between Richard Blakey and Gray, although Gray was cheated of his half-century when the last man Darren Gough was bowled by Mike Kasprowicz. Although Glamorgan lost Jimmy Maher in the first over Powell continued where he had been interrupted in the first innings, when he scored 146. In alliances with Mark Wallace, Adrian Dale and David Hemp he allowed Croft to time his declaration at leisure. A draw may be favourite, but there is still fighting to be done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
