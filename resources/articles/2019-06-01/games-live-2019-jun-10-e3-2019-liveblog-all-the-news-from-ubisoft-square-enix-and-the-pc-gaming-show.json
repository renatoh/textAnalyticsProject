E3 proper begins tomorrow, but it feels a lot of the biggest announcements have already been made. Final Fantasy VII Remake, Watch Dogs: Brexit Edition and Marvel\u2019s Avengers. A big day for gaming. Surprise! It\u2019s a live game, a la Destiny or The Division. Avengers delivers \u201ca narrative over multiple years, with exciting new content released on a regular basis.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll assemble into teams of up to four players online, where you can master exciting abilities and muster a roster of exciting heroes. Every new hero, every new region will be delivered at no cost\u201d And there won\u2019t be random lootboxes or pay to win either. Another trailer reveals the game\u2019s interpretation of Hank Pym, Ant Man, before the release date: Out worldwide on PS4, Xbox One, Stadia and PC, with some platform exclusives for Playstation\u2026 on May 15, 2020. The team emphasises that the game is \u201cCrystal Dynamics own interpretation of Avengers\u201d, explaining why the likes of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr are missing, but it does make it all the odder that the character design is lifted straight from the movies. The Tomb Raider developer has big shoes to step into. A bit more detail: the story begins five years after the team was forced to disband following that inciting incident. \u201cIt\u2019s about losing what matters to you most, and fighting to get it back.\u201d \u201cThis is a story about self-acceptance in the face of adversity\u2026 and learning that together we are mighty.\u201d But the biggest title is saved for last: Crystal Dynamics\u2019 Avengers. It\u2019ll take some getting used to for fans of the movies, since the game doesn\u2019t have the likenesses of any of the actors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the game looks like it does a good job of providing playable interpretations of all the big five: Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Black Widow are all shown as playable characters, with the action switching between them as they try, and fail, to prevent a mysterious villain from taking down a Helicarrier. And that\u2019s not the only thing lost in the inciting incident: the game appears to take place largely following the apparent death of Captain America. SURPRISE: There is a Final Fantasy VIII rerelease coming. The game had been thought lost, with rumours that the original source code had been deleted, and only the PC version remained. But clearly someone has managed: it\u2019s coming out this year. Oninaki is a new RPG from the skunkworks team at Square Enix who made retro-styled RPG I Am Setsuna. It\u2019s out August 22 this year. We\u2019re all waiting for Avengers, but first, an introduction for Outriders, a new postapocalyptic co-op shooter from the makers of Bulletstorm. Coming 2020, the all-FMV trailer doesn\u2019t reveal much about the game, but hopefully Sebastian Wojciechowski, the head of Polish developers People Can Fly, can tell us a bit more. He introduces a video that describes the game as \u201ca dark modern shooter with traditional values. We are creating an experience with a strong story that you can enjoy with your friends and on your own.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cone, two or three-player drop-in, drop-out co-op shooter\u201d, more prosaically. Now, an announcement of a new mobile game to live \u201calongside\u201d Final Fantasy Brave Exvius. War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has a mouthful of a name, and appears to tell a fairly sweeping Game of Thrones-esque story of a warring nation. As for actual gameplay, it looks to call back to the much loved Final Fantasy Tactics series \u2013 a step up from the fairly basic play of FFBV. A new trailer next for the postapocalyptic parkour zombie-escape sim Dying Light 2, already announced for Spring 2020, and a surprise announcement of a pair of rereleases of retro JRPGs that never made it to the west: SaGa Scarlett Grace, and Romancing SaGa 3. This trailer is apparently extremely exciting if you\u2019re a Final Fantasy XIV player but I have almost no idea what is going on. It\u2019s sparkly, though! Naoki Yoshida, producer of Final Fantasy XIV, the popular MMO, arrives to demo the game\u2019s third expansion pack Shadowbringers, debuting July 2nd. The game now has 16 million registered users, a remarkable turnaround after a launch so disastrous that the entire game was torn down, and the in-game world literally destroyed, before being relaunched as A Realm Reborn in 2013. The expansion pack includes two new jobs, and two new playable races, and a new story \u201croughly equal in size to a standalone singleplayer RPG\u201d. And now the trailer for a game that everyone knew would be coming: the first expansion to Kingdom Hearts 3, the mega-collaboration with Disney. That game ended with a bizarre conversation between two characters from its famously convoluted backstory, that had barely any relationship to the main plot. Well, now we see what it means: coming this winter, the Re-Minds DLC will (might) answer some questions. A trailer round-up for Square Enix\u2019s indie label, Collective, introduces us to the titles coming in 2020. Circuit Superstars, a racing game from Mexico \u201cmixes top down racing with a classic sharp arcade look\u201d. It looks like a loving homage to Micro Machines and the like, and features online multiplayer \u2013 of course. Coming to PC, PS4, Xbox One and Switch. Battalion 1944 is a throwback competitive multiplayer shooter, for those who think Counter-Strike is too dumbed-down. It\u2019s also already out, so I\u2019m not entirely clear what\u2019s 2020 about this. More Dragon Quest! Coming to Switch is the formerly-exclusive-to-PS4 Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. The game, now branded the Definitive Edition S, will feature a new 2D mode, letting players experience the entire adventure as though it was a SNES game from 1993. And it\u2019s out this autumn. A trailer for Dragon Quest Builders 2 comes next. This Minecraft-like sequel merges, well, (dragon) questing and (mine) crafting, and now farming too. And the game supports four-player online co-op, so you can enlist your friends as willing labourers. Out July 12th, with a demo arriving on the Playstation store in late June. The remasters keep coming: the 2008 Xbox 360 RPG Last Remnant is coming out on Switch \u2013 today. The game was fairly well received back in the day, when it was seen as the last attempt by Microsoft to break the Japanese market. And then we get a release date for another remake: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, coming to smartphones with online co-op. The original, a Gamecube exclusive, never got the attention it deserved, with a proto-Wii U approach requiring each individual player to use a Gameboy Advance to manage their action. The immediately after that, the announcement that last year\u2019s throwback Switch exclusive RPG, Octopath Traveller, is coming to PC. And we\u2019re done with Final Fantasy. Next up, a trailer Life is Strange 2, with the sequel to the award winning 2015 adventure game announced as Playable Today. Finally, we see another new trailer for the game. Scenes like Cloud\u2019s motorcycle escape from Midgar, his first meeting with Aerith \u2013 and a first look at the remade Tifa. Again, my ears hurt from the volume of the cheers. And then, to cap off the trailer, the first appearance of Sephiroth, the game\u2019s antagonist. Available worldwide, March 3 2020, exclusive to PS4. A \u201c1st Class Edition\u201d, featuring a statue of Cloud on a motorbike, prompts a cry of \u201ctake my wallet\u201d from the crowd. Trailer over, Tetsuya Nomura, the game\u2019s director, takes to the stage as well. With the interpreter making four, it\u2019s getting crowded up there. \u201cIt has been a while since we\u2019ve had Nomura work so heavily on a project like this,\u201d Kitase says, \u201cso it\u2019s good to see him work with the same passion he had 22 years ago.\u201d Nomura adds, alongside Kitase, his gratitude for those who\u2019ve been \u201csupporting us so patiently,\u201d before revealing a bombshell: the game will be playable at the Square Enix booth during E3. It shouldn\u2019t be that surprising, since we already knew the game was coming in just nine months, but still \u2014 this is a moment many thought would never come. And we launch into a new excerpt to finish the first section: the Scorpion Sentinel, the game\u2019s first boss. The fight proceeds as players of the original will remember, but the new battle system really shows its stuff, suggesting that the promises of real tactical action might be justified. That\u2019ll be a relief for those who played Final Fantasy XV\u2019s superficially similar battle system and found themselves mostly button-mashing their way through battles. Where the original fight with the scorpion had a famously dodgy translation that read as a command to \u201cattack while the tail is up\u201d, rather than the warning it was supposed to be, the new version has a different command: take cover behind debris before it fires off its main attack. Positioning your characters isn\u2019t just for show, as it was in Square Enix\u2019s Dragon Quest XI, then. Finally, after first destroying one leg of the Scorpion, Cloud and Barrat take out the boss completely. It plunges off the gantry, to deafening cheers from the crowd. For those who want to avoid menus, \u201cabilities and spells can be bound to shortcuts for immediate action\u201d, but the ATB sticks around regardless. Square Enix\u2019s Neal Pabon takes the stage to introduce the first ever look at gameplay in the remake. \u201cReal-time action merged with strategic combat\u201d is the claim. Tapping the square button will let Cloud hit enemies with his normal attacks, but it will also fill up an ATB bar \u2013 when that fills up, the game enters Tactical mode, where players can cast spells and use special abilities. You don\u2019t just play as Cloud: a single button press switches to Barret, Cloud\u2019s gun-handed ally, and Pabon teases that we\u2019ll see Tifa Lockhart \u201csoon\u201d. \u201cTo our long-time fans, we thank you for your support and patience over these years,\u201d Kitase says. I don\u2019t speak Japanese well enough to know whether he emphasised \u201cpatience\u201d there. \u201cRemaking Final Fantasy VII has allowed us to dive much deeper into the world and its titles than ever before. \u201cWe anticipate two blu-ray discs full of gameplay content,\u201d he adds, to cheers from the crowd. One of the discs will go further into the history of the world of Final Fantasy VII, suggesting the game has swelled from a remake to a near sequel. A suitably dramatic beginning: the curtain rises to reveal the game-over screen of Final Fantasy VII: NEW GAME or Continue? Another option fades into view: Remake? The crowd laps it up, of course, and we get a brief clip of the same trailer we saw last month, before Yoshinori Kitase, the game\u2019s producer, takes the stage. But enough of the Indie games. The countdown on stage has hit 10 seconds. Time to go. Undermine PC, Xbox One, Switch. Release date: Early access in Summer 2019 A pixelated action-adventure roguelike, Undermine\u2019s two-person team has created a game that blends the procedurally-generated rooms of Binding of Isaac with the aesthetics of Spelunky and the hot mining action of Stardew Valley. Each run sees you playing as a new peasant, tasked by a wizard to explore the caverns below your village in order to work out what is causing the dangerous earthquakes that shake your home. Each run will see you die, frequently fairly quickly, but still cart back enough resources to improve your next characters, powering up you pickaxes, boots and armour to endure more challenging tasks. The game will feel familiar to roguelike fans \u2013 perhaps too familiar, if what you\u2019re looking for is a whole new experience. But it has polish, and when it launches in early access on Steam this summer, expect it to pick up a following. Spiritfarer Xbox One, PS4, Switch, PC. Release date: Early 2020 This indie game, styled as \u201ca cozy management game about dying\u201d, was given a fairly hefty slot at Microsoft\u2019s presser. It sees you playing as Stella, ferrymaster to the deceased, as she sails the sea of the dead, carting spirits to the beyond. That\u2019s the \u201cdying\u201d part \u2013 but it\u2019s the \u201ccozy management game\u201d that caught the eye of many. The management part is the bulk of the gameplay: It tasks Stella with building vertically on her boat, to provide abodes for choosy spirits, land for growing crops on, kitchens for cooking meals in and, presumably, more besides. She can fish, farm and literally bottle lightning in order to gather the needed resources. And then there\u2019s the cozy. With its animated 2D look, Spiritfarer has charm in bucketloads. And, while the ten minute hands-on didn\u2019t provide much of a look at the depth of the relationships between the cast, it did show the tone and feel, which is, well, cozy. There may be drama later in the plot, but one gets the sense that if Spiritfarer leaves you feeling anything but warm and fuzzy, the developers will be trying to work out what went wrong. While we wait for Square Enix to start its conference, I\u2019ll run you through a few smaller games on show at the convention that might not have hit headlines, but deserve some attention nonetheless. Alex Hern here, signing on from Los Angeles and warming up my typing fingers for the Square Enix press conference which starts in just twenty minutes time. We\u2019ve already had some pretty major news from the company: a release date for the Final Fantasy VII Remake \u2013 and one much closer than anyone expected. During a concert of video game music last night, Square Enix announced that the long-awaited recreation of the PlayStation game will be arriving on March 3, 2020. Until then: here\u2019s all the E3 news so far in one convenient round-up. Okay, that\u2019s me signing off. Technology editor Alex Hern will be back for all the Square Enix news at 6:00 PM PT / 2:00 AM BST. If either the Avengers or Final Fantasy float your boat, don\u2019t miss it. Watch Dogs Legion, set in post-Brexit London and directed by Far Cry 2\u2019s Clint Hocking, looks like an impressive next step for open-world games, letting you take control of anyone in the whole futuristic city to build a resistance against the tech-drive dystopia that the capital has become. It\u2019ll be out March 6th, 2020. The next Rainbow Six game, Quarantine, will be a 3-player co-operative shooter where the enemy is a scary and little-understood pandemic Ghost Recon Breakpoint is out on October 4th, with a beta going live September 5th New modes and updates were shown for established Ubisoft games Rainbow Six Siege, For Honor and The Division 2 Another new game was announced from the creators of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Gods and Monsters, centred on mythology rather than history Roller Champions is a new team sports game with a Dreamworks-esque look and feel - a downloadable demo is available now Ubisoft is joining the race to be the Netflix of Gaming with uPlay+, a $14.99 subscription service offering access to 100+ old games and new. It\u2019ll be partnering with Google Stadia to deliver it That\u2019s it for the announcements. What an impressively broad selection of games that was. It\u2019s a beautiful-looking game, this, heavily influenced by Breath of the Wild on first appearances, and by Greek mythology. It\u2019s out February 25 2020. He\u2019s announcing a new project from Quebec. Assassin\u2019s Creed producer Marc-Alexis Cote is here to show it off: \u201cfor years our minds have lingered on a different aspect of our history: mythology.\u201d Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is here to close things out, thanking the developers for their hard work. \u201cAt Ubisoft it is our intention to create games that make you stronger and happier in your life... we hope you will spend quality time with family and friends and meet new inspiring people, learn more about yourself by doing, and gain new perspective on the world, to help shape it.\u201d Do you wanna watch some people dancing? Here\u2019s that 10 years of Just Dance video from earlier, if you need a little joy boost. It\u2019s called Roller Champions, a team-based sports game, and an alpha demo is available to play today. Love a good surprise release. Looks like it\u2019s time to learn about Ubisoft\u2019s roller derby multiplayer game now. The trailer looks very cool, with Overwatch-style animated art. Haha, it\u2019s as if someone out there heard me. uPlay Plus will be partnering with Google\u2019s Stadia streaming service from 2020. See, the thing about this rush to be the Netflix of gaming is that THERE ARE NOT 14 DIFFERENT NETFLIXES, and that\u2019s why Netflix did so well: it got there first and did it properly. There\u2019s going to have to be some consolidation soon, because game companies cannot expect us to have 5 different $15 subscriptions going at any one time. It\u2019ll be $14.99 a month and will launch in September. Ah, it looks like Ubisoft has joined the subscription-service bandwagon. uPlay Plus is a PC service that will give you early access to new games and 100+ old ones from Ubi\u2019s catalogue for your money. Oh good, Ubisoft has been working on a movie! Video game movies always work out. The Division movie will be coming out on Netflix and stars Jake Gyllenhaal. Ah, it\u2019s just into the surrounding woodlands. And the zoo. And, later this year, the Pentagon. Here\u2019s a trailer. Time to learn what\u2019s next for The Division 2, the totally-not-political military squad-shooter set in a devastated Washington DC. It\u2019ll be playable for free between June 13th and 16th, if you want to try it out. The first expansion will allow players out of Washington and into the rest of the US, it seems. The enemy is an unknown and devastating parasite. Here\u2019s a teaser trailer. \u201cWhat Siege is to the PvP shooter, Quarantine will be to PvE co-op, testing your tactical skills and survival instincts.\u201d A tense trailer now for a horror/zombie-themed 3-player co-operative Rainbow Six game: Quarantine. A supernatural-themed update is coming to Ubisoft\u2019s bone-crunching melee-weapon combat game For Honor. That\u2019s available to play now if big axes and possessed fighters sound appealing. There will be new Just Dance in November. Until that footage is up, here\u2019s a trailer for the Tom Clancy mobile game. Hooray for the annual Ubisoft dance-off. The panda is back and everything. Who cares about that though when we\u2019ve got new Just Dance! It\u2019s been ten years since this world-beating dance game first appeared and it\u2019s one of the most successful game franchises of all time. (This will only come as a surprise if you\u2019ve never busted it out at a kids\u2019 birthday party.) Ah, but we\u2019re not leaving Tom Clancy behind just yet: here\u2019s a smartphone squad combat game, Tom Clancy\u2019s EliteSquad. Before we leave Ghost Recon behind, here\u2019s a gameplay trailer. Ghost Recon Breakpoint is out on October 4th, with a beta going live September 5th, spec-ops fans. Ubisoft will bring back AI companions for solo players in the next Ghost Recon, we\u2019re being told. They\u2019re also launching a new hub for \u2018community creators\u2019. I\u2019m still thinking about Watch Dogs Legion. I want to hijack a bus Ghost Recon Breakpoint involves a lot of jungle fighting, on the evidence of this trailer. Certainly a change of pace from the very urban Division 2 Here\u2019s a trailer for the new Rainbow Six Siege update, available now: Jon Bernthal has brought a dog onto the stage. Not sure whether people are more excited about the celebrity or the pooch \u201cThe only test of a man\u2019s worth is battle,\u201d says a mean-looking Jon Bernthal in a new trailer for the new Tom Clancy\u2019s Ghost Recon, one of Ubisoft\u2019s several military-themed shooters. Now Adventure Time\u2019s Finn and Jake are here to shill Brawlhalla, the Smash Bros-esque arena fighting game. Not quite Keanu Reeves but I\u2019ll take it. Here\u2019s that Watch Dogs footage for you - definitely the best thing I\u2019ve seen at the show so far. The trailer for this comedy show (?) is so close to actual promotional videos from video game developers that I\u2019m not 100% sure it\u2019s a joke That\u2019s it for Watch Dogs - now Rob McElhenney of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is here to talk about his new Apple TV show about game developers, Mythic Quest. Oooh, a release date! March 6th, 2020. With the usual caveat that this is E3 footage and who knows how closely it will resemble the final game, this is very encouraging. Watch Dogs Legion is playable on the E3 show floor. \u201cEvery Londoner is fully simulated, with a persistent life and relationships... anyone can be won over to your cause.\u201d They\u2019re all voiced and animated, and every cinematic in the game will change depending on whom you\u2019re playing. Play a squad of old ladies in Bletchley Park or a team of classic British spies. This is unprecedented! \u201cWhere London goes, all of us go together,\u201d says Clint. \u201cThe UK has become a surveillance state and freedom replaces fear... deportation squads rip people from their homes and Grandad is using cryptocurrency to buy a new kidney on the black market.\u201d Bloody hell, Clint, we know Brexit is going to be bad, no need to rub it in We\u2019ve got a name: Watch Dogs Legion. It\u2019s being directed by Clint Hocking, famous for Far Cry 2. Bet we won\u2019t get any \u201cbut it\u2019s not political, honest\u201d nonsense from him. There\u2019s some really impressive open-world action stuff going on here - this could easily challenge Grand Theft Auto (perhaps not that surprising, at GTA V is pretty old now and it\u2019s about time there was a new open-world crime game on the scene). We now appear to be riding a drone around the backstreets of rainy Camden before infiltrating a weed-and-weapons operation that also appears to be into human trafficking. Look, I know Camden Market has changed over the years, but really If you want grannies tasing London cops before hopping on a bus to Camden Market, this is absolutely the game for you Now we\u2019re playing an elderly lady in compression stockings who is also a LEVEL 12 HACKER, and is casing Scotland Yard. Not going to lie, this looks brilliant. We\u2019re tooling about the place in a black cab now, having started a gun-fight with the armed police. If you lose a character in action, they\u2019re gone forever - you move on to a new London citizen to continue their work. After some preamble from superfluous hosts, we\u2019re onto Ubisoft\u2019s big announcement of the night: a new Watch Dogs game set in post-Brexit London. Extremists have taken over, technology companies\u2019 power is out of control, and we as platers can recruit take control of any citizen we see to mount a resistance. In the gameplay footage, we see a mouthy skinhead walking around a convincing futuristic Piccadilly Square. Well, this is rather sedate and pleasant. I do love a bit of classical music with my video game news. Here comes the news! We\u2019re in the Orpheum Theatre in LA as a live orchestra plays Assassin\u2019s Creed music to open proceedings. Two cool pieces of Assassin\u2019s Creed news before the show (Odyssey, that is, not the forthcoming viking-themed one): Ubisoft has opened up a story creation tool on PC that lets players mess around with the game\u2019s narrative tools to create their own quests; and Discovery Tour (the interactive-museum-like mode that premiered in Origins\u2019 Ancient Egypt) is coming to Odyssey\u2019s Ancient Greece. You can get quizzed on your Spartan history by King Leonidas. Genuinely cool. Man, if only Keanu Reeves had come out last night at the Xbox presser and just straight-up told people not to be dicks when playing online \u201cDon\u2019t be a toxic dick!\u201d advises Ice-T. \u201cThere\u2019s an art to dealing with trolls. Mute the dumb f***s. I\u2019m sick of hearing sexist, racist, homophobic bullshit from the assholes out there trying to ruin it for the rest of us.\u201d Uh... right on, Ice-T! If you happened to be watching the Ubisoft pre-show right now, you\u2019d be seeing Ice-T running down some rules of gamer etiquette. It\u2019s far too early for this. Also, I know it gets a lot of stick, but I personally love the yearly Just Dance costumed choreography. Whilst we\u2019re waiting for Ubisoft to kick off, shall we relive some of the best Ubi moments from E3s past? I\u2019m particularly partial to when the creative director at Trials developer RedLynx crashed spectacularly. I\u2019m only 80% sure it was staged. Quick reminder of what to expect from today\u2019s/tonight\u2019s remaining conferences: Ubisoft - 1:00 PM PT / 9:00 PM BST: at least two interesting new games, both of which have sadly already leaked and one of which might be of particular interest to those of us envisioning a grim post-Brexit future Square Enix - 6:00 PM PT / 2:00 AM BST: the premiere of a new Avengers game will be the star here, alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake That was an absolute marathon from the PC Gaming Show! We\u2019ve got about 45 minutes until Ubisoft kicks off - see you then. Shenmue 3 is out on 19 November, with the PC version exclusive to the Epic Games store. The trailer showed some combat and story scenes and there\u2019s a classic Dreamcast feel to it. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is out in the first quarter of 2020 and looks like its a fitting successor to the cult gothic masterpiece. Chivalry 2 lets you chop limbs off, and even keep fighting when your own limbs have been severed. Maneater still looks like the world\u2019s greatest open-world shark RPG. That\u2019s me signing off. Stay tuned for Keza and Ubisoft! Well, I think that\u2019s all from the PC Gaming Show. Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it. I\u2019ll add a few more trailers so do keep refreshing. Alright old-timers, here comes Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 from Larian Studios, which was announced recently. Larian got the rights to develop the classic D&amp;D role-playing series, which is over 20 years old. All the iconic monsters, characters and places are in there apparently, and there are systems to allow emergent combat, just like a tabletop D&amp;D experience. There will also be a Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 prequel tabletop game - it\u2019s out in September and it\u2019ll give players an idea of what\u2019s happening in the world, which is set 100 years after Baldur\u2019s Gate 2. As yet though, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 has no release date. Genesis Noir is an existential odyssey from Fellow Traveller, set during the Big Bang. The trailer is quite a thing - a monochrome film noir-esque confection with jazz soundtrack and Saul Bass references. It looks like you wander amongst the birthing planets, um... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll dig out the trailer and leave it to you. Now it\u2019s Telling Lies from Annapurna Interactive and Sam Barlow, the creator of the brilliant CCTV thriller Her Story. Here, you watch video footage to piece together the story in which a woman has stolen an NSA memory stick showing footage of the game\u2019s four characters. Something has gone horribly wrong and you have to work out what and why. You can pick out certain words and phrases spoken by the characters, looking them up on an in-game database. It looks like footage is taken from fictitious video diaries and video phone messages. There\u2019s a confessional Sex, Lies and Videotape feel to it all. Players have to pick up on the subtext of each recording, listen out for names and places and start making links. Apparently there\u2019s over ten hours of footage and the story encompasses two years of events. Telling Lies is out \u201cvery soon\u201d according to Barlow. Yay, it\u2019s time for Maneater, which was a highlight of last year\u2019s PC Gaming Show. It\u2019s an open-world shark RPG - you start as a baby shark (do do do do do doooo) and have to eat to survive. At key life phases you make a big jump in size and power and as that happens you can evolve parts of your body - for example, metal teeth and mutated lungs. The trailer shows you stalking a boat load of hairy fishermen, causing havoc. Scaly Pete is the villain of the story - he\u2019s the Quint of the game, a shark hunter. The story of the game is revealed through a reality TV show following Pete on his adventures. \u2018GTA but you\u2019re a shark\u2019 is the elevator pitch. It\u2019ll be out within a year. Borderlands 3 is on stage now with questions from the community. The developers are adding lots of different grenades, unique class mods which give new skills, and artefacts which add to movement allowing you to slide faster, or adding explosions to sliding. As for end game content, there\u2019s a Guardian system like the previous Bad Ass Ranks, which provides infinite progression. Boss fights - there will be huge ones. There will be multiple huge vaults with giant bosses, as well as mini-bosses littered about. Multiplayer will allow participants to jump in at any time. Tiny Tina will be fighting alongside the vault raiders. The level limit will be 50. You\u2019ll be able to transfer weapons between characters. I think that\u2019s it. A world exclusive reveal of CrisTales from Modus Games, a love letter to classic JRPGs. The visuals are beautiful and highly stylised. You can rewrite the past and change the future apparently. Will have to watch this again later as it\u2019s lovely. Auto Chess from Chinese publisher Dragonest has been a success on mobile and now it\u2019s coming to PC. It\u2019s a chess-themed MOBA title coming to the Epic Store later this year. Here\u2019s Patrice D\u00e9silets, the creator of Assassin\u2019s Creed, talking about his new title, Ancestors, which is about the evolution of the human race \u2013 so not particularly ambitious then. You play modern humankind\u2019s predecessors and must guide a clan through dangerous landscapes and lots of predators. There\u2019s no story, there are no mini-maps, you\u2019re just trying to survive and evolve. It\u2019s out 27 August. Here\u2019s what Keza thought of it a few months back: Okay so after a reveal for Vermin Tide 2, the fantasy co-op game, we move onto Per Aspera where you play as an AI orbiting Mars charged with terraforming the planet so humans can live on it. Admittedly I missed most of the Songs of Conquest trailer because I was having a little cry, but it\u2019s a fantasy strategy adventure where you gather resources to build up your town, then take part in turn-based battles. The Heroes of Might and Magic series has been a major influence. He\u2019s here to talk about Shenmue 3, which was recently delayed. He says thank you to the fans for supporting him for over 20 years. You\u2019re welcome Suzuki-san. Okay, it\u2019s a world exclusive look at the game! We start with a grand master telling Ryo his kung fu isn\u2019t strong enough. They spar in lovely detail. Then we get our hero running through a beautifully intricate small town, fighting local gangsters. The dialogue is classic Shenmue. My heart is bursting. It\u2019s out 19 November! Thank you, Yu Suzuki! Oh my god, Yu Suzuki is on stage \u2013 the genius behind Outrun, Hang-On and Virtua Fighter. *Sega fanboy faints* Planet Zoo is a zoo management game from Frontier Developments, the UK studio behind Elite Dangerous and a whole host of Tycoon sims. Here comes the trailer. Run your dream zoo (we all have one), and... oh I\u2019ve just been distracted by a photorealistic hippo doing a giant poo... where was I? It\u2019s a modern zoo so you learn about conservation while you play \u2013 the health and welfare of your animals is the most important aspect. Griftlands is a turn-based card-battling adventure with nice cell-shaded cartoon visuals. Alpha keys become available on 11 July. Remnant: From the Ashes from Gunfire Games is up \u2013 it\u2019s a co-op action shooter set on an apocalyptic Earth and other worlds. Replayability is a big focus with NPCs, missions and areas all newly generated each time. You can play over and over and never see the same monsters and areas twice. Bosses drop unique loot so you\u2019ll get weapons and armour that your friends might never have found. You can bring pals in to take on the biggest threats. It\u2019s out on 20 August. Zombie Army Dead War 4 is the next shooter from the makers of Sniper Elite 4. It\u2019s 1946 and Europe has been torn to pieces by an evil zombie-esque army. The trailer shows a variety of fighters battling hordes of the undead, some armed with flame throwers. The game uses the same slow-mo bullet-tracking effect as the Sniper Elite series so you get to see brains flying out and skulls exploding if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. You can set up trip wires to electrify enemies, or just splatter them with mini cannon. Age of Wonders: Planetfall is a strategy game where you play as a survivor of a shattered civilisation looking to reboot your society. Each race has different abilities and there are genetic labs to set up to create battling monsters, including dinosaurs with laser beams. That\u2019s dinosaurs with fricking laser beams. You also get orbital laser cannon, and a science lab where you can build cyber-soldiers and deadly viruses. The game is due on PC and consoles on 6 August, which is the day after my birthday. The Last Oasis is an open-world adventure in which the Earth has stopped rotating and now humanity must keep moving through the endless deserts to survive. Looks like you\u2019ll be piloting wind-powered land ships and besieging wooden castles. It\u2019s out in September. After a brief look at a new Samsung monitor, we\u2019re on to Funcom\u2019s upcoming titles including Mutant Year Zero: Seed of Evil, fantasy battle game Conan Unconquered (29 May) and Cthulu-esque sci-fi horror title Moons of Madness (Halloween 2019). Now the founder of Australian studio Mighty Kingdom is showing off Conan Chop Chop, a cute-looking roguelike action adventure \u2013 sort of Zelda meets Castle Crashers. It\u2019s out in September and looks fun. I\u2019m adding trailers as I go along by the way, so keep refreshing! The permadeath adventure sequel Unexplored 2 from Big Sugar is up next. The lovely bright visuals are a contrast to all the gothic darkness we\u2019ve had so far. A quick trailer from dark dystopian adventure game Mosaic: This is followed by a look at spooky multiplayer game Midnight Ghost Hunt. The ghost hunters in rubber suits have to track down spooks who are able to hide in inanimate objects like lamps and chairs. Players take part in teams, hunters vs spooks, and the latter have to stay hidden and safe until the clock strikes midnight. When that time comes, the roles switch and the ghosts hunt the humans. There will be an alpha event in the summer. And now it\u2019s Starmancer from Chucklefish, an isometric-view space craft simulator, which looks cute and in-depth simultaneously. After that it\u2019s Chivalry 2 from Tripwire Interactive and Torn Banner, a medieval-themed sword-fighting game. The trailer shows an attack on a castle with lots of siege equipment and splashing blood noises. We\u2019re promised more fluid animation and a core focus on fighting multiple opponents at the same time. \u201cWe know half of people play the game drunk,\u201d says someone on stage. The teaser ends with a horseman performing a hilarious surprise beheading on a fleeing enemy, which doesn\u2019t seem particularly chivalrous. It\u2019s multiplayer with up to 64 players and it\u2019s coming next year. Next up: the world\u2019s first gameplay footage of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 from Paradox Interactive. Lots of gothic darkness, stabbings and cool characters in long coats. The vampires stay in the shadows and feed on human blood to fill up their health meters. But there are different types of blood, based on the emotional resonance of the victim. According to writer (and erstwhile Guardian games contributor) Cara Ellison, there will be fragile volatile relationships with the non-player characters, and lots of moral quandaries around feeding off the living. It\u2019s coming out in the first quarter of 2020. Here comes Evil Genius 2: World Domination from UK studio Rebellion, the sequel to the company\u2019s 1960s supervillain simulator. A fun trailer shows the Austin Powers-style vibe. Oh no, apparently, they\u2019re going to be pulling comments from the Twitch and YouTube chat streams. This isn\u2019t going to end well. Broadcasting live from the Mayan Theatre in Los Angeles for the next two hours with Sean Plott and Frankie Ward hosting. While we\u2019re waiting, you can check out the rest of out E3 coverage so far! The Xbox conference live-blog \u2013 all the news from Microsoft\u2019s big night, as it happened. Project Scarlett: what we know so far about the next Xbox \u2013 we don\u2019t know much, but here it all is! Bethesda at E3 2019 \u2013 Deathloop and Ghostwire Tokyo enliven a muted show.

We\u2019re just waiting for the kick off, but the organisers have promised at least 30 new games including some world exclusive reveals. We can expect more information on Borderlands 3, the shark action game Maneater and maybe a peek at Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the sequel to the cult 2004 title. There should also be news from indie-centric publishers Annapurna Interactive and Chucklefish. But the best thing about this event is the surprise element \u2013 without major publishers dominating, there\u2019s more room for unexpected delights.
