His mother, 76-year-old Ann Fahey, had been found collapsed on the floor of her room at the Newmarch House aged-care home in Penrith, in Sydney\u2019s west, where she is a resident. Nurses feared she\u2019d fallen out of bed, but when he spoke to her on the phone Ann told Fahey that after waking during the night she\u2019d felt tired and dizzy and had laid down on the floor. \u201cShe had a 38.9 degree temperature so she was a bit off with the fairies, but all she kept saying was that she was tired,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cShe just wanted to get off the phone and sleep.\u201d By early afternoon staff confirmed what he\u2019d feared: more than a month after the aged-care home went into lockdown and after two previous tests came back negative, his mother was one of three new confirmed cases of Covid-19 recorded at Newmarch. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, she\u2019s shut herself in her room the entire time,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cThere\u2019s shitloads going through my mind. Why is it still happening? \u2026 How can they still be getting new cases after this long. I mean it\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s coming in from the outside because she\u2019s been meticulous following all their guidelines.\u201d The Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House, which has so far claimed the lives of 13 residents and threatens to overtake the Ruby Princess as Australia\u2019s deadliest wave of the virus, began when a part-time carer worked six shifts while symptomatic and infectious. Newmarch had already been in a type of lockdown before then. On 18 March the national cabinet announced rules placing strict limitations on the number of visitors allowed inside aged-care homes. The rules meant visits were limited to two adult visitors at once a day inside a resident\u2019s room. But when the staff member returned a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 on 11 April after being told she had come into contact with a confirmed case, a flood of cases within the home were quickly discovered. On 12 April the first resident returned a positive result for the virus. Six days later a 93-year-old man became the first to die. Despite efforts to isolate every resident and the federal government\u2019s introduction of surge workers from a private company, Aspen Medical, to help contain the outbreak, infections have risen steadily. There are now 61 confirmed cases of Covid-19 related to Newmarch House, including 24 staff and 37 residents. On Wednesday a 74-year-old man became the 13th resident to die and on Saturday, two further staff members tested positive. New South Wales health officials have said the staff member who first became infected had experienced only extremely mild symptoms before testing positive, and the state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told media the woman was \u201cmortified\u201d when she discovered she had the virus. In any case, the spiralling death toll inside the aged care home has left the families of some residents furious with Newmarch\u2019s operator, Anglicare. Families have been gathering outside the facility to hold a vigil every afternoon, with some lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their relative through a window. This week, a group of family members published an open letter to Anglicare\u2019s chief executive, Grant Millard, saying communication from within the home had been \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d. \u201cPhones went unanswered day after day. Calls were not returned. Details about our individual loved ones were not provided regularly,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThe residents were reporting that the care was inadequate and they were becoming distressed. Many of them were sick and frightened and did not have regular access to their family on the outside which increased their levels of anxiety as well as ours.\u201d Some family members say Anglicare has improved its communication. After the NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, held a press conference outside the home on Wednesday, Louise Payne, who has led much of the campaign to improve communication with families, said she\u2019d received a phone call from Millard and been able to have a window visit with her mother. \u201cIt was wonderful. It sounds such a little thing but I was absolutely elated because it\u2019s been two weeks of hell not knowing how she is,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no guarantees, but it\u2019s looking like mum might be one of the ones to beat this. She\u2019s nearly 90, so if she does it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Others, however, are losing patience. Elizabeth Lane, from Windsor, in Sydney\u2019s west, takes comfort in knowing her mother, Rose Davies, 84, is still making life hard for the nurses in Newmarch. \u201cMum\u2019s always been a very difficult individual, so when they say she\u2019s being a bit of a handful I think: \u2018Thank god, she\u2019s still OK.\u2019 If they told me she was being nice and cooperative I\u2019d know something was wrong,\u201d she said. Davies lives in the palliative wing of Newmarch, and suffers from dementia. She has not tested positive for Covid-19, but Lane\u2019s voice cracks as she talks about the toll more than a month without seeing her family is taking on her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to think this is how she\u2019s going to end her days,\u201d she said. \u201cI know this is horrible for everyone. People have already lost their family, but I can\u2019t help thinking we may have lost our parents too. By the time we get to speak to them again, they\u2019re not going to know who we are. For dementia patients having no contact, no stimulation, it all exacerbates their decline.\u201d Lane said that when the outbreak occurred, she \u201cnaively\u201d trusted that Anglicare would manage to \u201cget on top of this\u201d. But as the weeks have passed, her patience with the lack of communication from the home has worn out. When the aged-care home provided mobile phones for residents, Lane said she discovered her mother\u2019s hadn\u2019t been set up for her. A number she had been calling in the nurse\u2019s station for updates was abruptly disconnected with no warning. \u201cI\u2019ve got six or seven numbers that I just call over and over until someone answers,\u201d she said. She was finally able to see her mother through a window on Friday, but only after she contacted the federal minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck. \u201cHe called me and said he\u2019d sort it out for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the staff, this has been an absolute shitstorm, there\u2019s no better word for it. The whole world has had trouble dealing with it. But I just think there hasn\u2019t been a real emergency plan in place and everything feels really reactive, even now.\u201d Matthew Fowler, whose father Lionel has so far tested negative to Covid-19 twice, says he has been frustrated at Anglicare\u2019s management of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely appalling that a worker who was sick was allowed to work six shifts there.\u201d On Friday, he joined the daily vigil outside the home, and said he was glad to see Anglicare had placed a senior chaplain for gathering family for the first time. \u201cIt should have happened from the first day.\u201d As federal and state governments coordinate local health districts and surge staffing assistance to Newmarch, health authorities are struggling to understand how the virus is still spreading inside the heavily controlled facility. In a statement, Anglicare said the new infections had occurred \u201cdespite us having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d. \u201cThese new cases may reflect historical transmissions and reflect the rigorous and ongoing testing at Newmarch House. We will be investigating further how this has occurred,\u201d the statement read. On Friday, when unveiling a national code for aged-care facility visitation, Colbeck said the government\u2019s assistance to Newmarch meant it was \u201ceffectively running a mini-hospital within the facility\u201d, but did not criticise Anglicare for its response to the situation. \u201cThere has been no limit on the resources made available to Newmarch in managing this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a finger-pointing or a blame exercise, it\u2019s a very, very unfortunate circumstance where somebody who was asymptomatic, but obviously had a very high viral load, was in contact with people for six days, residents and staff, and this is the very, very tragic outcome of that.\u201d On Saturday, Chant announced a further infection control review of Newmarch launched after a wave of infections this week had shown breaches of safety protocol \u201camongst particularly the staff\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred,\u201d Chant said. For the family of some residents, the situation is become increasingly desperate. \u201cI sort of lost my temper with it all the other night a bit. I just think, can\u2019t they bring the army in, get them all out of this toxic cesspit and take them somewhere else,\u201d Mark Fahey said. \u201cYou only get one mum. As soon as I found out, my first instinct is just to go and get her, but you can\u2019t get into the joint. It\u2019s the worst place in Australia to be unfortunately, and I can\u2019t get her out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
