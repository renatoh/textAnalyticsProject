The City manager is hopeful that by next month\u2019s international break the champions can overhaul the leaders. City travel to Upton Park knowing a win will close the gap with Chelsea to two points. Pellegrini hopes this may cause Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team to slip up at Manchester United on Sunday. He also mentioned Chelsea\u2019s trip to Liverpool on 8 November. Asked if City can apply pressure, Pellegrini said: \u201cWell, if we win, maybe. Chelsea have two very difficult games away with Manchester United and Liverpool. It\u2019s one moment to try to win our points and we\u2019ll see before the international break how many points they have.\u201d Pellegrini said Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s strong start \u2013 the striker has 11 goals in 11 appearances \u2013 and injury-free run is down to how he began the season. \u201cIf you remember in the first games in August we made him mix between pre-season and the start of the Premier League. That was very important for him to try to recover 100% fitness. He had just finished an important World Cup and he had many days to rest. The way he prepared his season in August is very important on what he\u2019s doing now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
