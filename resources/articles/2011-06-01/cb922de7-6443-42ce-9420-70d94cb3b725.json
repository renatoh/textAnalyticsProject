For instance, reporting an inquest jury's finding that London newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson was unlawfully killed during the G20 protests of 2009, a story said: \"The jury had to be satisfied 'beyond reasonable doubt' \u2026 the same burden of proof that would be applied in a criminal trial\" (PC who struck Tomlinson could face trial, 4 May, page 3 turned from page 1). In another instance, an article said that the verdict of a German court \u2013 that John Demjanjuk was an accessory to the murder of thousands of Jewish captives at Sobibor death camp in occupied Poland during the second world war \u2013 had \"lowered the burden of proof\" in such cases because it was based on evidence proving only that Demjanjuk worked as an SS guard at the camp, not that he had committed a specific crime (After 68 years, Nazi guard found guilty over his role in deaths of 28,000 Jews, 13 May, page 19). What these stories were actually referring to is the \"standard of proof\" that must be met for a decision in law to be reached. By contrast, the \"burden of proof\" is the requirement resting on a plaintiff or defendant to prove the facts of the case. \u2022 An article on the saving of the art deco Majestic, one of Africa's first cinemas, inadvertently referred to Dar es Salaam as Tanzania's capital. The official capital is Dodoma, although the much larger Dar es Salaam remains the commercial capital (Saving the Majestic \u2013 Zanzibar's lost screen gem, 3 June, page 23)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
