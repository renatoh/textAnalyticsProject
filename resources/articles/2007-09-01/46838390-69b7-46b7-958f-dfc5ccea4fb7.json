This is probably just as well because, as everyone knows, Vladimir Putin is the only person in Russian politics who matters. All the public forums where the burning question of Mr Putin's successor will be debated - the corridors of the Kremlin, the Duma, the Council of the Federation, the thinktanks and the superheated airwaves of the media - are as nothing to the one chamber with influence over the actions of the president: his head. This, for a big, unruly country, is either a real achievement or its greatest political weakness. The appointment of Viktor Zubkov had even seasoned Kremlinologists reaching for the Who's Who. Mr Zubkov had successfully spent his career as a bureaucrat avoiding the limelight. He comes from a tight circle of St Petersburg colleagues who have shown total loyality to the president. Mr Zubkov, who turns 66 tomorrow, had been preparing to step down as head of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service. Within a day he was giving interviews saying that if he did a good job as premier he might go on to run for the presidency. Mr Zubkov was already performing his most valuable service, which was to get everyone guessing what his patron and puppetmaster was up to. For weeks the cognoscenti had been tipping Sergei Ivanov - the hawkish but suave, English-speaking first deputy prime minister - for the post. He still remains the leading candidate to replace the president. Mr Putin had repeatedly said he would honour the constitution, which bars him from serving a third consecutive term. But nothing stops him from putting a staunch loyalist in power next year and at some future date returning as president for a third and fourth term. Mr Putin may leave the Kremlin next year, but no one seriously believes he will stop pulling the strings. There are formalities to be observed, such as Duma elections in December and presidential elections next March. Elections in Russia are less about offering genuine choice than providing a chance for voters to affirm a candidate who has already been anointed. The delicate process of fashioning a presidential successor does, however, create its own anomalies. To foster the impression of a genuine transfer of power, Mr Putin's successor needs to acquire a public profile. For this, Mr Putin needs to generate publicity for the man he has chosen. But not too much, since he does not want scrutiny of the process that lies behind it. A stage-managed transfer is still a critical period for the chief executive. The appointment of an unknown as prime minister ensures that no one, except Mr Putin, knows what to expect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
