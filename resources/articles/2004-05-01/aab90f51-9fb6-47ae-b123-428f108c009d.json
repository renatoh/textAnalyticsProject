The two bodies have struggled over the past two years to reach a compromise that meets Wada's disciplinary strictures while still allowing Fifa to maintain its own anti-doping systems. A formal signing will take place here today at Fifa's 100th anniversary congress. The Fifa spokesman Andreas Herren said: \"Common ground has been found. The signing is a declaration of intent rather than the precise form of the agreement but that is just a matter of sorting out the legal formalities.\" The Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who once described Wada as \"a monster\", had raised concerns in the past that many positive dope tests in football, compared with track and field, stem from the use of social rather than performance-enhancing drugs. But he seems to have paved the way for the agreement by negotiating a formula through which all football-related positive tests should be considered \"special cases\". This would circumvent the Wada demand that guilty athletes receive mandatory minimum two-year suspensions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
