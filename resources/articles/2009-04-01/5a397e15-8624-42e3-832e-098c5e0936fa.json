The chairman already has two promotions to the Premier League to his name, and right now there is plenty on his mind. \"He loves this club and comes down to see us a fair bit, not just when we win,\" said Cameron Jerome, the substitute whose intervention, three minutes after his arrival, secured three points and kept Birmingham's fate in their own hands. \"He wishes the staff, manager and players all the best and congratulates us if it's been an important win, like this,\" Jerome added. \"This time he just said well done, there are two games left but we've still got a big job to do and not to get ahead of ourselves and think we've already done it.\" Victory against Preston at home on Saturday and a win at Reading in the last game would take Birmingham up, although if third-placed Sheffield United fail to win at Burnley this evening there would be more scope for error. Whatever the result, nobody at St Andrew's will be getting too excited if Alex McLeish can help it and after this one, nor should they. A patchy performance saw Watford give as good as they got in the second half and left the manager grateful to his reserve goalkeeper, Colin Doyle, starting a league game for the first time this season. He turned a goal-bound Grzegorz Rasiak header past a post just after the hour. \"I'm pleased for the big yin, he's trained the whole season, waiting for a chance, been a good professional. He stepped up when Maik [Taylor] was sent off and he's done it again today,\" McLeish said. The Scot will not be watching tonight's match at Burnley. \"I'd rather go out,\" McLeish added. \"I'm not a ghoul. There's something morbid about watching that. I'll probably take my wife for a meal.\" McLeish's decision on Saturday to introduce Kevin Phillips and Jerome proved inspired and, although Jerome's first contribution was to thrash around on the floor to try to win a free-kick, his second, a minute later, was decisive as he picked up a Damien Johnson through-ball, cut inside the box on the left and saw his shot deflect off Ross Jenkins and loop into the net. \"I said to Cameron, there is every chance you come off this bench and win this game for us,\" McLeish said. An anxious morning awaits as the manager checks today on the fitness of David Murphy (knee), Keith Fahey (cramp) and Franck Queudrue (groin). With Maik Taylor and Lee Carsley available after suspension and Phillips regaining his sharpness, McLeish has resources at his disposal. \"Hopefully, we can catch Preston cold next week after their big [6-0] win,\" added Jerome, one of only four survivors from the City side that secured their last promotion, against Sheffield Wednesday two years ago. \"They may arrive with a spring in their step, but maybe having beaten Cardiff so convincingly could work in our favour. If they are all cocky and arrogant we might go and smash them 6-0. We haven't beaten anyone by a big score like that all season and I think we're due one. Hopefully we've saved it for next week.\" McLeish and Gold would happily settle for a win by the odd goal.
