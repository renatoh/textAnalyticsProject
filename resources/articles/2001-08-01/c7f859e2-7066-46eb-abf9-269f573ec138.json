The Bolton effect is apparent all over western Europe. Look at Lens, Gil Vicente, Energie Cottbus. And this week's Des Lynam what-a-waste-of money award goes to Des Lynam, with an honourable mention for Pro-Zone, Andy Townsend's Tactics Truck and Bernard Tapie. This is hardly fair, you may think. He's just a glammed-up front man with no great understanding of football: he can hardly be blamed for his team's stupidity, overelaboration and lack of coherence. Tapie, on the other hand, ... Tapie appears to be even more hands-on at Olympique Marseille as he used to be before his unfortunate run-in with the Gendarmerie and his enforced sabbatical with the Prisonnerie. \"I have a real handicap in terms of attacking qualities,\" he told Le Parisien, and by I he means Olympique Marseille. Le club, c'est moi. \"I have enormous obligations to succeed,\" he said, after he had lost 1-0 at home to Troyes, leaving him thrashing helplessly around the bottom of the first division with two points - and only one goal - from his first four games of the season. \"I'm going to sign two strikers.\" One of them looks certain to be Galatasaray's Mario Jardel, the tall Brazilian who won the 1999 European golden boot while with Porto. He was due in Marseille today, he told L'Equipe, \"to discuss the final details of the contract\". Tapie also plans to appoint the former Monaco manager Claude Puel as technical director to assist the Marseille coach Jose Anigo. \"Anigo is doing a great job,\" Tapie told Le Parisien, \"but he perhaps lacks a little bit of experience at that level.\" Unlike, you might think, Tapie himself. The French champions Nantes are keeping Marseille off the bottom of the table. The Canaries lost 2-1 to Bastia to leave them with only one point from their four matches. Monaco are also struggling. Didier Deschamps' team scored their first goals of the season at home to Paris St-Germain but could only draw 2-2 after giving up a two-goal half-time lead. The Parisiens' recovery was begun by a stupendous goal from Frederic Dehu, who hit the far corner of the net with an overhead kick from outside the penalty area. That's typical of Monaco's luck, said Deschamps.\"Dehu does not score many goals and there he goes scoring that beauty against us.\" Meanwhile Racing Lens continued their fast start with a 1-0 win at Metz secured by El Hadji Diouf's 40th-minute goal against the run of play. They have won all four of their games and remain two points clear of Auxerre, who beat Sedan 2-1 on Sunday with a goal in injury-time from Djibril Cisse, his seventh of the season. Borussia Dortmund, who also have maximum points from four games, are top in Germany. But they lead Kaiserslautern only on goal difference after their 2-0 win over Hansa Rostock. Never before in the Bundesliga's 39 years has a team won its first four games without conceding a goal. Three points back in third place are Energie Cottbus, a small-town club so hopelessly passe that it has kept its old GDR-type state-sponsored name. They returned from their 60-mile trip to Berlin with a 3-2 win secured by goals from two Brazilians, Vragel da Silva and Brasilia, and one from a Pole, Andrzej Kobylanski. But winning is not the only thing, according to these coaches. Dortmund's Matthias Sammer lamented his team's lack of \"real killer instinct\". And Cottbus's Eduard Geyer complained: \"The result was satisfying but our performance wasn't.\" Geyer could give David O'Leary lessons in talking down his team's chances. Never mind the championship, he says, Cottbus won't even finish in the Bundesliga's top seven. \"Anyone talking about the Uefa Cup at this point doesn't have a clue about football.\" The chances are good that anyone you may have heard talking about Gil Vicente knows more about medieval literature than football. The club from the northern market town of Barcelos (say Bar-selsh) is named after Portugal's most famous playwright. Gil (say Jeel) have never done anything other than make up the numbers in the Portuguese League, but after two games of this season they lead the table. They beat Braga 2-1 on Saturday, the winning goal coming from a Carlos Martins (say Carlsh Marteensh) penalty after the Portuguese international goalkeeper Quim (don't say anything) brought down Marco Nuno. The Dutch season got under way with a dramatic game at Groningen. The champions PSV Eindhoven fell 2-0 behind but recovered to draw 2-2 with some help from a red card for Groningen's Brazilian midfielder Hugo and a late headed goal from the splendidly monickered Jan Vennegor of Hesselink. Feyenoord got off to a fast start with a 5-0 win in the derby against Sparta Rotterdam. Their two strikers performed contrary to the reputations they cultivated in England: the goal-hungry Pierre van Hooydonk missed a penalty and the goal-shy Jon Dahl Tomasson got a hat-trick. Roma claimed the Italian Super Cup - the equivalent of the Charity Shield - with a 3-0 win over Fiorentina ... Ronaldo returned to the Internazionale line-up after his year out, scoring one goal and making another in 35 minutes of a charity game against the Nigerian champions Enyimba ... The former West Ham and Spurs forward Ilie Dumitrescu has been sacked by Brasov only three games into the Romanian season because, he says, he resisted interference from the club's owner ... The former Barnsley striker Georgi Hristov is refusing to play for Macedonia while Gjore Jovanovski remains as coach after the striker was suspended for breaking curfew last month ... And in Russia, CSKA Moscow broke a club record by going 18 games without defeat, but all celebrations were cancelled with their goalkeeper in hospital with serious head injuries sustained in their 0-0 draw away to Anji Makhachkala. Serhiy Perkhun, a Ukrainian international, was given only a 5% chance of survival before being transferred to a Moscow hospital on Sunday. He is now reported to be in a \"serious but stable\" condition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
