The Belgian, riding for Omega Pharma-Quick Step, extended his overall lead in the seven-stage race after timing his final sprint perfectly to finish ahead of Daniele Ratto (Canondale) and Brett Lancaster (Orica). Meersman has a 14-second lead over the Astana rider Valerio Agnoli, who was one of five riders to fall on the last bend about 200m from the finish of the 160-km stage from Girona to Banyoles. All five were awarded the same time as the leading group. Wiggins, the Tour de France champion, avoided the crash and now lies eighth provisionally behind his team-mates David L\u00f3pez (seventh) and Dario Cataldo (sixth), about 20 seconds adrift of Meersman. Wednesday's stage is a 112-mile stretch from Vidreres to Setcases when the climbs begin, and Team Sky's sporting director, Marcus Ljungqvist, feels his team are ready to make a strong impression. \"It's a good situation to have the numbers for tomorrow,\" Ljungqvist said. \"It will be all about the legs on the climbs during the next two days. Then we'll see where we are after that. \"The team is confident and everyone is going well. We've got a strong group of guys here and we're looking forward to the challenge.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
