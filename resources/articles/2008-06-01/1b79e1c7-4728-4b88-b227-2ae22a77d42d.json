With the subsequent arrival of piano prodigy Gwilym Simcock to join Creese and saxist Tim Garland, the trio mostly switched to originals - operating on that precarious hinterland between jazz improv and contemporary-classical chamber music. Creese, a devotee of church architecture, added the idea of coupling a new repertoire to the largely untapped performance possibilities of the church circuit. The group's latest and most ambitious incarnation is this 14-date tour, also featuring a young strings ensemble, that stopped off at the Spitalfields festival this week. Garland and Simcock each provided a set's worth of music - written with the acoustics of the space in mind, and setting the augmented Sacconi Strings ensemble loose to roam, unleashing pizzicato snaps and warm, long-note harmonies from the galleries and the side aisles. Garland's half mixed contrasting dissonances and percussive sounds with passages of rhapsodic lyricism, and extensively used call-and-response motifs that the strings parts progressively enriched. His improvisational ingenuity and tonal variety - on soprano and tenor saxes, flute and bass clarinet - was a masterclass in how to use the space. Gwilym Simcock's second-half feature offered more sonic variety and catchier grooves, with the composer playing piano and French horn, shrewdly deploying both Garland's fragile flute-playing and rugged postbop tenor swing, and exploiting Creese's big sound and rhythmic drive. A tenor-blasting Garland powering his way down the centre aisle to join a cello and bass-powered pumping beat on stage was an ecstatic episode, as was the whooping bass clarinet solo over the encore's deliciously skewed tango. At Beverley Minster on Saturday. Box office: 01482 391672. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
