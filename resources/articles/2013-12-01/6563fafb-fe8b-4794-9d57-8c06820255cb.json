When the South African president, Jacob Zuma, wearing a sombre black Nehru-collar tunic, addressed the nation and much of the world just before midnight last Thursday to break the news of Nelson Mandela's death, he rose to the occasion. Even Zuma's critics have praised the gravitas and carefully crafted prose with which he captured the national mood, his description of Mandela as the nation's \"greatest son\" striking a chord like Tony Blair's \"people's princess\" remark after the death of Diana. The moment took the heat off an ailing, scandal-hit presidency. Only a week earlier Zuma had been besieged by negative headlines about the spending of 215m (\u00a312.6m) rand of taxpayers' money on his private home in the village of Nkandla. Analysts had been predicting that he could lead Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) to its worst-ever result at next year's election. Less than an hour after Mandela's death was announced, however, ANC supporters in party colours and regalia were among those rallying outside his house singing liberation-era songs. The surge of nostalgia for Mandela has inevitably recalled the ANC's past glories. Some believe that this could revive its fortunes at the ballot box. William Gumede, a political author and academic, said: \"Mandela's death has rescued Zuma politically. He was getting to a tipping point with Nkandla and other crises. It was also the week when the unions were going to decide whether to form their own political party but now that has been postponed. \"So the ANC might get some temporary relief. Its own polls had said the highest they could get in the election was 55% and the lowest 45%. But now they might get 60% again because people who'd decided they weren't going to vote may now give them one more chance.\" But Gumede added: \"If that happens it will only be a temporary thing because then there may be a really big backlash. As people focus on Mandela's legacy and compare him to Zuma, they will see the contrast is so big.\" That is the flipside. Inevitably the question is now being asked: after almost 20 years in government, has Mandela's beloved ANC lived up to his dreams or betrayed his inheritance? He was an unswervingly loyal party man and used to joke that after death he would join the nearest ANC branch in heaven. But Bill Keller, who reported for the New York Times from Johannesburg in 1992-95, mused two decades later: \"I imagine that some days the news - if it penetrates the fog that I'm told enshrouds the 94-year-old Nelson Mandela - must break his heart.\" The ANC believes it has a positive story to tell. At a meeting with Southern Africa's Foreign Correspondents' Association in Johannesburg in June, Zuma listed the party's achievements since it came to power with Mandela as president in 1994. He said it had built millions of homes, given many people access to water for the first time and provided more social grants to the poor and vulnerable: from 2.5 million in 1993 to 16 million today. The proportion of households with electric lighting rose from 51.4% in 2001 to 84.6% in 2011. The South African economy, Zuma contended, had expanded by 83% under the ANC. National income per capita had increased 40% from 27,500 rand in 1993 to 38,500 rand in 2012. Disposable income per capita of households had gone up by 43%. Total employment had increased by more than 3.5 million since 1994, he claimed. Average real wages in mining and industry had increased by more than 150%. And after its early and well-chronicled failures, the government has tackled the HIV/Aids epidemic, leading to a rise in life expectancy. According to Zuma, every type of crime, except white-collar crime, has been reduced. Even the scourge of corruption was being dealt with, he insisted. And now there is a national development plan to slay the three-headed dragon of poverty, unemployment and inequality. Asked by the Guardian to reflect on the ANC's successes and failures in government, Zuma replied: \"If you had taken government in 1994 from apartheid, which had destroyed the country, you will realise that the challenge is very huge. There will be things that in 20 years, the scars are still showing, and certainly we are looking at what it is we are doing to improve the state of the country. \"Generally, I know people don't compare where we've come from and what we've done. There are many issues we are still dealing with. We have not done what we would have wanted, to implement all our correct policies, for a variety of reasons, but we believe we have made very good progress. We believe in 19 years we have made progress that no other African country that emerged from colonialism has made. We believe we have done a lot.\" The pernicious legacy of apartheid, with its systematic denial of education to millions of black people, and its spatial segregation written into the very landscape of the country, cannot be dismissed lightly. The growing number of tourists who visit South Africa today find gleaming airports, shopping centres patronised by all ethnic groups and spectacular stadiums built for the successfully hosted 2010 World Cup. They even visit townships such as Soweto where there is evidence of a developing middle class. This remains Africa's most powerful economy. But perhaps Mandela's greatest tribute is South Africa's liberal constitution, lauded around the world, and democratic institutions. Elections are held every five years and judged free and fair. Although the ANC remains dominant, and its willingness to accept defeat at the polls has not yet been tested, Mandela's humble decision to step down after one term ensured that this would be no repeat of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. The party and the country are already on a fourth leader. South Africans also have an independent judiciary, robust media and dynamic civil society \u2013 a crucial force in the turnaround on Aids policy. There is, however, a counter-narrative about Africa's oldest liberation party that is every bit as compelling. This is the story of a party, and a country, in perpetual crisis, from an education system that remains shambolic no matter how much money is thrown at it to an unbridged chasm between rich and poor. By this critique, the ANC is rife with corruption, with the misallocation of lucrative government tenders giving rise to a new term: \"tenderpreneurs\". The most egregious instance was a 1990s international arms deal costing an estimated 70bn rand (\u00a35.5bn) of taxpayers' money. A decade later, with much of the military equipment redundant, official inquiries continue into allegations that bribes worth more than 2bn rand were paid to individuals and the ANC itself. This story of the ANC reached a nadir in 2012 when police shot dead 34 striking mineworkers at Marikana, the worst state security crackdown since the apartheid days. The idea of a black government gunning down black workers would surely have given Mandela the heartbreak that Keller described. The men held primarily responsible for all of this are Mandela's successors. Thabo Mbeki was widely regarded as the power behind the throne even when Mandela was president, with the latter content to be a globetrotting figurehead. Mbeki's own tenure, whatever its merits, is now tainted in memory by a so-called \"Aids denialism\" that delayed the distribution of life-saving antiretroviral drugs and his failure to hold Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to democratic account. After a brief interim under Kgalema Motlanthe, the presidency passed to Zuma, seen by opponents as personifying much of the present malaise. Bribery and racketeering charges against the polygamous populist were dropped just before his election, which was earned in part by whipping up support with the apartheid-era rallying song \"Bring me my machine gun\". Among the many opposition parties, street protesters and journalists who warn that the ANC government is delivering too little too slowly is Zwelinzima Vavi, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,currently suspended over alleged misconduct. Unemployment stands at a massive 36.7% using the most realistic definition, he noted in a June 2013 speech, with the proportion of those out of work for more than a year at 68%. Vavi cited a 2010 report showing that 44% of workers in South Africa live on less than 10 rand a day, which only just pays for a loaf of brown bread. \"So 44% of workers in South Africa are working for a loaf of bread a day,\" he said. \"It is still intrinsically a low-wage colonial economy. \"Even though we created an estimated 1.9 million jobs between 2002 and 2007, these jobs seem to have increased rather than decreasing the levels of poverty, and since then more retrenchments have thrown even more people into poverty.\" From luxury wine estates to squalid and violent informal settlements, South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world. Vavi cited figures showing that half the population lives on 8% of the national income, while recent estimates suggest that the top 5% of earners earn 30 times more than the bottom 5%. And ethnicity, a boundary Mandela did so much to cross, is still a defining factor in life chances and many social contexts. The South African Institute of Race Relations found the median salary for black people in 2011 was 2,380 rand, while white people earned 10,000 rand. \"This is the story of inequalities in South Africa,\" Vavi said. Blaming apartheid for such ills will no longer do, according to Zuma's critics, who say it is time the ANC took responsibility. Bantu Holomisa, who was expelled from the party and now leads the United Democratic Movement, said: \"There were some areas where the country under the ANC made achievements: Mandela and [his successor Thabo] Mbeki moved with speed to put institutions in place. But the challenge has been their effectiveness. Nine out of 10 times you find the good work was undermined by the deployment of cadres who couldn't get work in parliament.\" He continued: \"Unfortunately, corruption seems to have engulfed the top echelon of the movement. The main failure was not to understand the difference between the ANC and the government. Whenever there was a scandal they tended to close ranks at the expense of the nation. When we celebrate 20 years of democracy in 2014, people will be saying the ANC is showing signs of imploding.\" Holomisa remained close to Mandela even after leaving the ANC and visited him in hospital in June 2013. \"Definitely this is not the country that he dreamed about,\" he reflected. \"Whoever thought South Africa would be led by someone [Zuma] facing nearly 800 corruption charges, which were unceremoniously taken out of court? I don't think the Mandelas and Sisulus would be impressed by what Zuma is doing.\" Obbey Mabena, an ANC veteran, who is critical of the party's current leadership, pointed to the slow pace of land redistribution, the illegal bulldozing of homes and the Marikana massacre. \"It's pretty much the way things were under apartheid. Nothing has changed except the faces of those in parliament, which means the country is heading for disaster.\" Progress versus decline, corruption versus integrity, building a new nation versus dragging it towards catastrophe: both narratives compete in any evaluation of the ANC under and after Mandela. And this, perhaps, was always inevitable as a 101-year-old liberation movement dedicated to the overthrow of colonialism and apartheid suddenly found itself at the levers of power. Steven Friedman, of Rhodes University and the University of Johannesburg, said: \"There's always a sense in a new democracy of over-promising and under-delivering. It's in the nature of new democracies. \"I think that where the ANC must take responsibility is that they did indicate that they were serious about actually placing this country on a different path rather than simply integrating people into the old path. \"I think that has been a failure on their part but obviously it is not their failure alone. Business [and] other interest groups could have adjusted better than they did.\" Friedman gave the ANC nine marks out of 10 for conventional macroeconomic management since it came to power. But he added: \"If you're looking at really coming up with imaginative plans to deal with what is really the central South African problem since the 1990s \u2013 that is, how do we deal with poverty and inequality without really crippling the market economy \u2013 I think they'd have to get two or three out of 10, but then so would everybody else.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
