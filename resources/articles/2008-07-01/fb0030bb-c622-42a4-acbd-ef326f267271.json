The pianist at the premiere in Coventry and the subsequent London performances in 1962, as well as for several revivals, was John Constable. Margaret Kitchin, who has died aged 94, was a pianist chiefly remembered for her association with the music of Sir Michael Tippett, though she championed the works of many other, younger British composers. Anglo-Swiss by birth, she brought a cultivated European outlook to her search for a vital repertory. New music was part of the performer's job, she felt, and if it came to dominate her professional life because she was adept and so sympathetic to it, well and good. She was born in Montreux, to an English mother, Kate Piercy, and Swiss father, Othmar Rothen. A child prodigy, she attended the Montreux and Lausanne conservatories. In 1935, she married a British Council officer, Michael Kitchin, who was also a keen musician. They moved to England in 1949, where she studied at the Royal Academy of Music, but divorced soon after. Tippett introduced Margaret to Howard Hartog. She had been playing Tippett's first sonata and Hartog, then a music publisher, had recently taken Tippett on at Schott. They married in 1951 and remained together until Hartog's death in 1990. After her marriage, Margaret became almost a house pianist for his concert agency, Ingpen &amp; Williams. When visiting instrumentalists or singers on his list were passing through and needed a pianist for a recital or BBC broadcast, she was there. They were a union of minds and shared many interests, while each remaining still strongly individual people. As producer of many of Margaret's British broadcasts over 20 years or more, I came to know her well. She would readily have admitted that she was happiest working with composers on their new piano music and also, as required, to be cast as an ensemble pianist; but the 19th century was not a closed book to her, and every so often there was an opportunity for her to prepare a solo broadcast which uncovered unexpected areas of enthusiasm. There was Mendelssohn, for instance, whom she played marvellously, and I have a memory of her in an early set of Brahms variations (D Major, Op 21 No 1) giving a performance of rare affection and insight, projected with beautiful sound. A pupil of Jacqueline Blancart at the Lausanne conservatoire, she had been awarded a Prix d'excellence in 1945 by a jury that included Dinu Lipatti and Clara Haskil. She could play, and had she not met Tippett, married Howard and been a busy wife and mother, she might have made a busier solo career. When, in 1962, Tippett was working on King Priam, Margaret was engaged as pianist in the Covent Garden orchestra. The opera marked a radical change in his development, partly to do with his new conception of the orchestra and how he wanted to write for it. The piano in the pit was always going to be important, but as rehearsals progressed and Tippett settled the detail of the orchestral writing, Margaret found more and more of the material coming her way, and her hands increasingly full. She would not have balked at that - the composer knew best - and for her efforts she was rewarded by the dedication of Tippett's second sonata, which she premiered at the Edinburgh festival in the same year as the opera. Some later appearances at Edinburgh were as duo partner to the Italian flautist Severino Gazzelloni in Boulez's Sonatine; to the cellist Siegfried Palm in Webern, Chopin and Mendelssohn; to Robert Tear in the Tippett song-cycle The Heart's Assurance; and as solo, duo and ensemble pianist with Gerald English and Barry Tuckwell - in a bracing programme that included Boulez's first piano sonata and Britten's Canticle III, Beethoven's horn sonata, and songs by Schubert and Debussy. She appeared, too, at the Proms, and Malcolm Binns recalled to me playing there with her in Stravinsky's Les Noces under Pierre Boulez, the four pianists ably led by Margaret. She was warm and hospitable, good to be with, a shrewd observer of people and loyal to her friends, and she took pleasure in the achievements of others - players who took up the Tippett sonatas, for example, and built on what she had achieved. As an artist, she put the music first, and was happy to try to make the best of herself as a useful pianist. It is a pity that she had few opportunities to make commercial recordings, but there is welcome news that her versions of Tippett's first sonata and the Fantasia on a Theme of Handel for Piano and Orchestra, plus Iain Hamilton's piano sonata, are to become available again on the Lyrita label. Margaret is survived by the daughters of her first marriage, Jane Annemarie (Anne) and Clare. \u00b7 Margaret Kitchin, pianist, born March 23 1914; died June 16 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
