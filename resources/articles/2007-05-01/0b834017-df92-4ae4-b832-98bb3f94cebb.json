The Australian launched an assault on the Derbyshire bowling, the highlight being a remarkable 32 from a single Greg Smith over. Having sliced the first ball for a fortunate two, he hit the next five over the ropes. Hussey cleared the boundary with the next two deliveries, from Ant Botha, to record seven sixes in eight balls before he smashed a Wayne White full toss into the hands of Simon Katich on the midwicket boundary to end on 56. There was little chance of Derbyshire getting anywhere near the Notts total of 170 and none at all after they lost their first four wickets for nine runs on their way to a 50-run defeat. In the South Conference, Gloucestershire found unexpected bonuses as Essex capitulated in Bristol to lose by 22 runs. In a match reduced by the weather to 33 overs a side, Essex lost their last eight wickets for 49 runs in pursuit of Gloucestershire's total of 222. Ronnie Irani scored nine boundaries on his way to 60 before he fell in Ian Fisher's first over. Then, apart from Varun Chopra's half-century, Essex collapsed to be all out for 200, leaving the home county to hope for a semi-final place. Alex Gidman and Marcus North each took three wickets, encouraged, as well as surprised, no doubt, at how the match was transformed. Earlier, Gloucestershire had reached a decent total, attributable largely to a late blast of 70 runs off five overs. Their captain, Gidman, out to the last ball, was the principal aggressor with four sixes and four fours. North also stroked an assertive 50 before being bowled by Ryan ten Doeschate, who returned his best one-day figures of 5-50. Durham have signed the New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris on a short-term contract as a second overseas player. The 31-year-old will join the club early next month and is likely to stay until further international commitments in August. Durham's head coach, Geoff Cook, said: \"Scott is a top player and will undoubtedly be a great asset to the club. He put in some great performances in the World Cup and I'm sure he'll be a great contributor to the team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
