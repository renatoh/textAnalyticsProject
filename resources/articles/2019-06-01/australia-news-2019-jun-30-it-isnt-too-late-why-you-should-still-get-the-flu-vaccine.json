More than 220 Australians have died from the flu this year. On Thursday, Victorian health authorities announced that 43-year-old James Day, from Traralgon, had died after a week in hospital from flu complications. In NSW, seven people died in a week, between June 16 and 23. In May, doctors confirmed that 68 people had already died from flu and 40,000 had been infected before winter had begun. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The number of infections in May was three times higher than it typically is at this time of year. Initial infections began as early as January \u2013 at the height of summer \u2013 sparking fears of a year-long flu season. Experts are now predicting 4,000 people could die by the end of 2019. The safest way to gain protection from the flu is to get vaccinated. Guardian Australia spoke to health experts and NSW Health about common questions around the vaccine. Is it too late to get vaccinated? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d a NSW Health spokeswoman says. \u201cGetting the flu jab now will reduce your risk of catching the potentially lethal virus by half.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t too late,\u201d adds Kanta Subbarao, director of the World Health Organisation research centre into influenza in Melbourne. \u201cThere is a lot of influenza in the community and we really don\u2019t know whether it has peaked yet or how long it will continue. A typical flu season can go into October or September, so it is not too late to get the vaccine.\u201d Can the flu vaccine make you ill? No. Subbaro says this is a common myth and there is \u201cno risk\u201d that it can give you the flu. \u201cThat is absolutely not true. The vaccine that is administered in Australia is an inactivated virus. The virus is killed before it is administered. \u201cThe most that you can have is a bit of a sore arm. But you cannot get influenza from the vaccine. \u201cThose claims are urban myth,\u201d says NSW Health. \u201cYou cannot get sick by getting immunised.\u201d How long does it take to activate and how long does it last? It will take about two weeks for the vaccine to give you full protection, but after that, it will last the whole flu season. It won\u2019t last longer than a year. Is this flu season really worse than usual? All indications are that it is. \u201cThere was an unprecedented number of summer flu cases, which has so far continued into the winter months,\u201d says NSW Health. \u201cIt is concerning,\u201d Subbaro says. \u201cThe number of notifications in Australia are much higher than usual. We\u2019ve had an earlier start to the influenza season and it has continued in all jurisdictions.\u201d \u201cWe had a very severe influenza season in 2017. We haven\u2019t exceeded that yet but it is very early in the year. It is on track to be similar to 2017.\u201d Should I get the flu shot? Yes, especially if you are young, elderly or have an underlying medical condition \u2013 or wish to protect someone who is young, elderly or has a condition. \u201c115 children have been admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital Westmead with flu this year, including two needing critical care, and we encourage parents to vaccinate their children as soon as possible,\u201d NSW Health says. \u201cPeople who are in regular contact with vulnerable people, such as the elderly or infants, reduce the chance of exposing others to flu by being vaccinated.\u201d Flu shots are free for pregnant women, people over 65, Aboriginal people and those with medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart problems. Subbaro also adds that medicine is available by prescription for those who catch the flu and those who are vulnerable. \u201cPeople should keep in mind that there are antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
