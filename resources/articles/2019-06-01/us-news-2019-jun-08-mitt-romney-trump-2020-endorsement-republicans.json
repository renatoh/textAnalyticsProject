That said, the Utah senator remains happy to endorse his choice for president in 2016. Then, having called his party\u2019s nominee \u201ca phoney, a fraud\u201d, he voted for his wife, Ann. This week, Romney said: \u201cI still think she\u2019s doing a fine job.\u201d The former Massachusetts governor was elected to the Senate last year, after attempts at a rapprochement with Trump produced an unsuccessful bid to be named secretary of state that generated embarrassing public appearances. Trump endorsed Romney for Congress. Nonetheless the senator has emerged as a leading critic, if inconsistently and largely if not entirely regarding foreign policy. In January, Romney wrote a scathing column for the Washington Post in which he lamented Trump\u2019s behaviour, writing: \u201cWith the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent\u2019s shortfall has been most glaring.\u201d But he recently declined to join the Michigan representative Justin Amash in calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment from the Republican side of the aisle. Trump faces one declared challenger for the 2020 nomination, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld. Last week Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, who was courted by anti-Trump conservatives and openly considered a run, said he would not attempt to take Trump down. Romney\u2019s niece is chair of the Republican National Committee, which has faced criticism for supposedly seeking to block a primary challenge. As she runs a party firmly under Trump\u2019s sway, Ronna McDaniel has ceased using Romney as her middle name. Romney spoke to reporters on Friday at the E2 Summit, a gathering of politicians, donors and business figures in Park City, Utah. Romney hosts the event, which is chaired by former House speaker Paul Ryan, another who did not meet with noticeable success when attempting to oppose, contain or support the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think endorsements are worth a thimble of spit,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I stay out of the endorsements.\u201d He did not say who he thought would win the Democratic nomination, though he did say former vice-president Joe Biden would be a tougher challenger than his nearest rival in the polls, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. He added that he thought \u201cthe attitude here has got to be the same as across the country, which is the president will surely be the Republican nominee and an incumbent in a growing economy is more likely to win than to lose. But it\u2019s not a sure thing.\u201d Speaking before Trump announced a deal with Mexico on immigration and the withdrawal of threatened tariffs, Romney said: \u201cPunishing Mexico in some way is, in my opinion, a very bad idea. It\u2019s also expensive for Americans.\u201d But he said he did support Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods, which critics have said will similarly hurt American consumers. \u201cPresident Trump was right to push back hard on China, and I support that effort,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much recognition in the United States about the long-term issues with China. We haven\u2019t laid out a real comprehensive strategy to say, \u2018How do we up our game dramatically?\u2019\u201d The Deseret News reported that the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, appearing alongside Romney, was greeted by laughter when he said Trump was \u201cright out there. He\u2019s kind of Teddy Roosevelt on speed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
