The average village population of 6,000 generates 10 tonnes of rubbish a day. In total, 10 million people live on its banks, with nowhere to put their waste but into the water. Investigator and presenter Seyi Rhodes did not so much sail down the Citarum as carve his way through it during Thursday's Unreported World (Channel 4). Rhodes examines how, over the last few decades, more than 60% of its fish species have been wiped out and replaced, not only with the detritus yielded by a population explosion, but also with uncountable amounts of lead, mercury and chemicals from the textile factories on which vast swathes of the region and much of the Indonesian economy has come to depend. The documentary followed the traditional Unreported World route as closely as it did the waterways, focusing on one small disaster (if there is such a thing), and gradually pulling out to show its dire immediate effects and remorseless ramifications. The river contaminates the entire water table. People irrigate their paddy fields with it, wash in it, cook in it and drink it each time they pull a bucket from their wells. And, with no infrastructure to speak of, they add their own measure of pollution via untreated human waste, which runs in open sewers through their streets before heading back out into the Citarum. Rhodes confronts the deputy minister for the environment about his findings and about the impetigo-ridden children who fill the villages. There is legislation \u2013 for example, requiring the factories in which clothes are made for \"some of the world's biggest fashion names\", a phrase almost becoming inevitable in this kind of investigation, to treat their wastewater before discharging it. But the government is unwilling or maybe just unable, given the stranglehold manufacturers have on the economy, to enforce it. And so the river, and the world, roll on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
