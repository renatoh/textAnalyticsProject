Here are the reports: Manchester City 2-1 Bournemouth Shkendija 1-3 Tottenham Lincoln 2-7 Liverpool Europa League roundup Bristol City 0-3 Aston Villa I have a lot of time for this photo. Here is Andy Hunter\u2019s report. Football clubs need help ... Stats! Curtis Jones: \u201cI thought that we started well. Fair play to Lincoln, they turned up and gave us a good game. \u201cWhenever I am given a chance I will give 100% and I am just waiting for my turn.\u201d He then picks up his own Man of the Match trophy. Liverpool vs Arsenal Burnley vs Manchester City Brentford vs Fulham Everton vs West Ham Aston Villa vs Stoke City Leyton Orient/Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea Newport County vs Newcastle United Brighton &amp; Hove Albion vs Manchester United City got there in the end thanks to youngsters Delap and Foden. The future is very bright for those two. It turns out the Premier League champions are better than an average League One team, who knew? Fair play to Liverpool they were at it from the start and did not give Lincoln much of a sniff. Liverpool break through Minamino and he lays it off to Origi who takes aim and slams it across the goalkeeper and into the corner from 16 yards. 87 mins: Grant swings a corner straight out of play. I think this game is done. 85 mins: Things are very quiet at Sincil Bank now. Nothing left to see, really. Tottenham won! David Hytner wrote about it. I am mainly pleased that City scored as now I hopefully won\u2019t have to Google whether the game goes straight to penalties or if they have extra-time. BEN FISHER HAS WRITTEN SOME WORDS ABOUT BRISTOL CITY V ASTON VILLA. I am running around with my shirt above my head as Foden taps home after Mahrez\u2019s shot bounced off the post. That\u2019s quite funny ... 78 mins: Scully sends in a bouncing cross from the right which makes its way to Archibald but his header from six yards out is straight at Adrian. 76 mins: Jota almost marks his debut with a goal but he pulls his shot just wide from the edge of the area. 74 mins: Liverpool are now just knocking the ball around slowly as it\u2019s not worth doing much else. Sterling is on for City, too, now! 70 mins: Fabinho hits a low free-kick from just outside the area but it goes just side. Some Europa League action. 68 mins: Right goals in a match really is too many. The model jumps highest in the box to head home a corner off the bar and reduce the deficit in the process. How are things going for Manchester City? They have needed to bring on Kevin de Bruyne to sort stuff out. And another! Grujic picks up a loose ball on the edge of the area, composes himself and drills it into the corner. 64 mins: Shaqiri flicks the ball through to Tsimikas but his short squirts well wide. Lincoln get their reward for a better second half, as Edun and Scully combine before the latter caresses the ball into the bottom corner. 59 mins: Grant whips in a free-kick for Lincoln which Eyoma jabs a foot at but that only succeeds in sending it well wide. 56 mins: Elliott claims he was pulled back in the box by Bradley and demands a penalty but the referee takes pity on Lincoln. 54 mins: Jota is stripped and raring to go. Good luck to everyone in the Lincoln defence. A fine performance from Villa, which should give the team plenty of confidence, especially Traore who scored a fine goal on debut. 50 mins: Lincoln have a couple of chances to score but Liverpool hold firm. The ball is then quickly down the pitch to Origi, who cuts in from the left and hits a vicious strike which Palmer palms away. Lincoln are still trying to play out from the back, which is either brave or stupid. It\u2019s a fine line. 48 mins: What positives can Lincoln take out of this? They won\u2019t even get a nice shirt when they swap it later. Within 20 seconds of the whistle going, Liverpool have enough. The press wins the ball high up and Minamino taps into an empty net after Elliott has a shot saved. Peter Oh says with reference to the Gettysburg Address: \u201cStudents of U.S. history may find it interesting that Liverpool have put four scores past a Lincoln.\u201d Here we go again! Fabinho replaces Van Dijk at the break. Not a tough 45 for the Dutchman. Paul emails to say: \u201cEveryone talks about England\u2019s young players like Foden, Sancho, Bellingham, Monk etc., but maybe Curtis Jones will prove to be the best of the lot. Certainly, he has the talent and self-confidence to play with the best.\u201d Garry Monk\u2019s time will come! Now I will plug my own work from this week, just because I can. Half time news ... Lincoln City 0-4 Liverpool Manchester City 1-1 Bournemouth Game, set and match. 45 mins: Scully tries to chip Adrian from 40 yards. The goalkeeper is about eight yards off his line and the ball goes 15 yards over, so, all in all, a dreadful attempt. City youngster Bernab\u00e9 has left the pitch in tears on a stretcher after suffering a knee injury. A bad night for the lad. 42 mins: Just a reminder that Liverpool are good ... We can stop laughing, Son has put Spurs back into the lead. This isn\u2019t really a Europa League blog but J.R. wants to laugh at Jose. \u201cLet\u2019s all take a moment to point and laugh at Mourinho whose team is currently drawing with Shkendija,\u201d says J.R. \u201cOf course as Mourinho himself recently said he\u2019s only 1% responsible for how his players play so I guess he has nothing to do with their results then. \u201cSeriously, how does he get away with his nonsense? Anyway, I\u2019m taking my chance. As Nelson Muntz says, \u201cHa Ha!\u201d.\u201d Mendy is on for City ... \u201cLooks to me Shaqiri clearly had a look at Thiago over the weekend and thought \u2018sod it, I can do this deep lying midfielder lark. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll get in the team\u2019,\u201d ponders Neil Hattersley. \u201cOther than that, any word on why Brewster isn\u2019t even on the bench? Swedish tv promoted this game with a big picture of him so I can\u2019t be the only one surprised.\u201d One suspects he is heading out on loan soon enough. Peter Oh asks: \u201cSorry to ask an obvious question but did Delap throw the ball into the goal?\u201d No Peter, that\u2019s against the rules. Re 20.12, Espen Bommen says: \u201cBeing old enough to watch Rory Delaps kid play for Man City doesn\u2019t really bother me. What does bother me though is there\u2019s a good chance that in 10 years I\u2019ll watch somebody like Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s kid play and I\u2019ll tell my kid that I used to watch his grandad you know.\u201d Another fine finish from Jones, who gets away from about three defenders with a fine flick and the curls the ball into the corner - via a deflection - once more, this time from 18 yards out. 34 mins: Elliott is the latest to have a shot at goal, as he collects the ball, spins 20 yards out and hits a low effort towards the corner but Palmer gets down well. Over in Bristol ... Traore sends El Ghazi through, but the Villa cannot add to his tally as his shot grazes the crossbar. Rhys Williams pings a pass out to Origi, who heads it down to Jones, allowing him to open his body up and curl the ball into the top corner. Ooooof! 30 mins: Jones fires off a wicked shot which clips of Bridcutt. It was hit with plenty of force, so it must have hurt the Lincoln skipper. 28 mins: A very good chance for Lincoln as a cross is lifted into the box by Melbourne but it\u2019s a little too high for Eyoma, who heads up and over from six yards. Niall Mullen asks: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose Delap junior will play for Ireland like his dad? I don\u2019t think England really need any more exciting young talent.\u201d I grant Ireland permission to take him. Meanwhile, Luke Crane asks: \u201cRory Delap now has a son old enough to play at Man City? How old am I?\u201d Very/ 24 mins: Ultimately, Lincoln City are not as good as Liverpool, so have barely had a kick of note. This will be a long night for the Imps. The lead does not last long, as Surridge pops up with an equaliser by finishing off a lovely move. Your man Jolly. What a way to mark your debut! Rory\u2019s lad has just planted the ball in the top corner after a beauty of a pass from Foden. Lincoln have set their own downfall. They try to play the ball out the back and fail, as Liverpool intercept 20 yards from goal. The ball falls to Minamino on the edge of the box and he curls it into the corner. 17 mins: Curtis Jones kills the ball dead after a cross from Tsimikas but he flashes his shot wide from the penalty spot. 15 mins: Shaqiri seems to be playing quite deep, allowing him to get on the ball as much as possible. Admittedly, he has only had one touch of note thus far. And here it is ... 13 mins: Rhys Williams comes out of defence to intercept a pass. What a night for the young man, who was on loan at Kidderminster last season, to play alongside Van Dijk. Over at the Etihad, Manchester City have their first chance of the match. Foden slips the speedy Torres through on goal but Travers reacts well to repel the Spaniard. The Premier League side look to be out of sight after two early goals from El Ghazi and Traore. WOW! What a strike from the Swiss international. Shaqiri curls a free-kick up and over the wall from 25 yards and into the top corner. 8 mins: Bridcutt is fouled on the edge of his own box and takes as much time as possible to restart play. The midfielder is really using his experience to slow things down here so Lincoln can catch their breath. 6 mins: Nice work between Tsimikas and Shaqiri allows the Greek full-back to put in a half-decent cross but the goalkeeper claims it. 4 mins: Liverpool are seeing plenty of the ball here, which is little surprise. Lincoln are quickly learning what it\u2019s like to play against the Premier League champions. 2 mins: Liverpool are using a very high press and playing with plenty of intensity. There is certainly no taking the foot off the gas here. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! I would describe the kit as \u2018sea camouflage\u2019. It\u2019s a turquoise blue with waves or similar on it. Simon Xu says: \u201c10 years ago it would have been unthinkable to put \u2018Delap\u2019 and \u2018Guardiola\u2019 in the same sentence, let alone the same team. What a throwback!\u201d I am looking forward to seeing Harvey Elliott for 90 minutes tonight. I have seen him a couple of times and fancy witnessing him against a decent midfield. He must be good if he\u2019s keeping Scott Carson out of the team. Frankly, the game is done an dusted at Ashton Gate after less than 15 minutes. Debutant Traore has shown what he can do already by smashing a volley into the top corner. They are piping in music at Ashton Gate doe some reasons or other. Seems a bit pointless. Do the players really care? Some fine work from Davis sets up El Ghazi who calmly slots home. Joe Hart is playing for Spurs, you will all be pleased to know. \u201cAnd over in Europe, nice to see Joe Hart clinging onto a shutout victory five minutes in. Go Joe!\u201d says Richard Arthur. In non-Carabao news: Erik Lamela has given Spurs the lead against *check notes* Shkendija in the Europa League. Liverpool have completely changed their front three but Jota is still on the bench. What a wealth of talent they have available. At the same time, it probably means Shaqiri will not be there for much longer, as surely there are too many forwards in that squad. Ben Fisher is our man in Bristol. Phil Grey asks: \u201cIs that THE Van Dijk in the Liverpool defence? So cool for Montsma, and indeed all the Lincoln players, if it is.\u201d I was hoping it was Dick van Dyke operating in the sweeper role. Alas, it is not. Peter Oh emails to say: \u201cI look forward to Lewis Montsma strutting his stuff for Lincoln City today, but I\u2019m sure J\u00fcrgen Klopp will also strike a pose or two.\u201d To be fair, I bet Klopp\u2019s modelling has resulted in more Liverpool caps being sold than Montsma selling overpriced nonsense to idiots. Not exactly sure how City are going to lineup but they have picked Delap, Doyle, Harwood-Bellis and Bernabe, which is pretty exciting. Bournemouth, on the other hand, just have a bunch of blokes who weren\u2019t good enough for the Premier League. Man City: Steffen, Walker, Garcia, Harwood-Bellis, Rodrigo, Doyle, Foden, Bernabe, Torres, Mahrez, Delap Subs: Carson, Ake, Sterling, De Bruyne, Mendy, Nmecha, Palmer Bournemouth: Travers, Ofoborh, Simpson, Kelly, Smith, Rico, Gosling, L Cook, Billing, Brooks, Surridge Subs: Begovic, Stacey, S Cook, Lerma, Kilkenny, Zemura, Anthony Lincoln: Palmer, Bradley, Montsma, Eyoma, Melbourne, Bridcutt, Edun, Jones, Grant, Anderson, Scully Subs: Ross, Jackson, McGrandles, Howarth, Roughan, Archibald, Hopper Liverpool: Adrian, N Williams, R Williams, Van Dijk, Tsimikas, Grujic, Jones, Elliott, Shaqiri, Minamino, Origi Subs: Kelleher, Fabinho, Keita, Jota, Wilson, Alexander-Arnold, Van den Berg Ben Fisher has been speaking to a male model to compare their handsomeness. Bristol City: O\u2019Leary, Sessegnon, Vyner, Moore, Rowe, Eliasson, Brunt, Nagy, Palmer, Semenyo, Diedhiou Subs: Bentley, Mawson, Bakinson, Massengo, Paterson, Martin, Wells Aston Villa: Steer, Guilbert, Elmohamady, Hause, Taylor, Lansbury, Nakamba, J Ramsey, Traore, Davis, El Ghazi Subs: Kalinic, Mings, Target, Hourihane, McGinn, Trezeguet, Watkins Early-round matches in the League Cup on a Thursday night is the football we have all been waiting for. How many youngsters will Liverpool play at Lincoln? Will Rory Delap\u2019s son make his Manchester City debut against Bournemouth? So many questions we will get the answers to soon. Jurgen Klopp will give plenty of players a chance to impress at Sincil Bank, as due to the rigours of the season competing in four competitions is pretty tricky. Luckily, the German has lots of quality youngsters at his disposal; Neco Williams, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott generally impress when offered the chance to shine. Additionally, left-back Kostas Tsimikas could get a first taste of English football following his summer move from Olympiakos. Michael Appleton\u2019s side have won their opening two league matches in addition to beating Crewe and Bradford City in the Carabao. They are not short of confidence and will be keen to test themselves against the Premier League champions. \u201cThere are definitely no nerves, it\u2019s more excitement,\u201d Appleton said. A new goalkeeper will be on show for Manchester City, with Zack Steffen set to start between the sticks for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. The US international will make his debut behind a defence which could include Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who has looked steady in previous outings for the first team. As previously mentioned, it looks likely that Liam Delap will notch his first game as a professional, having sat on the bench against Wolves. The teenage striker has impressed in the youth ranks and has earned his chance to play but do not expect any long throw-ins. Oh, and Bristol City are playing Aston Villa, which is pretty exciting, too.
