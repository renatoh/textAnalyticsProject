Barritt saw only 17 minutes of action last season for England as a replacement in the opening two Six Nations matches after injuries disrupted his campaign, but he had been earmarked to return at inside-centre to partner Manu Tuilagi after a strong opening six weeks with Saracens. Tuilagi is unlikely to feature in this month\u2019s series as he recovers from a groin injury while his replacement at outside-centre in this year\u2019s Six Nations, Luther Burrell, is not expected to be fit to face New Zealand on Saturday after damaging his hand playing for Northampton in the European Champions Cup. Jonathan Joseph, who has not played for England since the 2013 tour to Argentina, is the one fit outside-centre specialist in the squad while Exeter\u2019s Henry Slade, a fly-half who has been playing at 13 for the Chiefs this season, was added last weekend. \u201cWe will consider Brad at 13,\u201d said the England coach, Stuart Lancaster. \u201cIt is the hardest position to defend from in the system we have, but he has played there. You want to develop consistency but, inevitably, we have learned there is always going to be an injury along the way that affects that. \u201cI want to give everyone an opportunity in training before the New Zealand game. Kyle Eastmond has not trained yet and while you might be settled in your mind you still need the reassurance of seeing them train to show their club form can translate into a different environment here. I will wait until Monday before finalising it to give everyone a chance and I am still waiting on Luther.\u201d Barritt and Eastmond look the preferred centre partnership, but if the latter fails to recover from a rib injury, Billy Twelvetrees would take over at 12. \u201cBrad brings a huge amount defensively, but he has improved his decision-making and his ability to get over the gainline,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cYou go back to the victory over New Zealand two years ago and his line break to Manu and back to him created a try. He can do that and he is a strong leader in the team.\u201d Barritt said his aim was to be named in the side and was not concerned where. \u201cRepresenting England is the ultimate and I would do it at tighthead prop if needed,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are subtle differences between 12 and 13, but the roles work hand in hand and they are reversible in the way England play. Kyle and I trained a lot together in New Zealand and we will have to wait and see what happens in the next few days.\u201d Barritt will bring a physical presence to the side, one of the factors behind the probable selection of Semesa Rokoduguni to win his first cap on the right wing. England face New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia, the latter group rivals in next year\u2019s World Cup, at Twickenham this month but Lancaster is not setting any victory targets as he looks to improve his record over the major southern hemisphere nations, two wins and a draw in 11 Tests. \u201cIf you set a target of three out of four, it implies you are happy to lose one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be an incredibly tough month. The quality of New Zealand and South Africa recently has been the highest, Samoa\u2019s players are benefitting from playing in Europe and Australia will be motivated to put recent events behind them. We are confident but mindful of the threats we face. \u201cWe have to get consistency of performance for the full 80 minutes, starting with New Zealand. We not sit here thinking we are a million miles away from them. We have got belief in the players and their belief has not been dented by the tour there. Outside expectations are rising, which has a lot to do with the World Cup. New Zealand\u2019s record since 2011 is phenomenal: they play tier-one nations and win home and away. While we respect them we have to make sure we create our own belief that we can do that and we know we can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
