The Labour conference just four weeks ago pulsated with predictions that Gordon Brown would face serious opposition before he marched into Number 10. The Prime Minister's supporters raged that they would never forgive the coup attempt which compelled him to announce that the Manchester conference was his last. The Chancellor's camp was furious when their man's big day was wrecked by the Cheriebomb exploding that he was a liar. The chances of there being a smooth'n'orderly transition from the departing king to the restless crown prince seemed more remote than ever. That there would be a challenge to the Chancellor from within the cabinet was treated as a near certainty by many observers. The mantra of a month ago was that Labour needed 'a contest, not a coronation'. Under pressure to demonstrate what an inclusive and expansive figure he could be, even Gordon Brown felt compelled to declare that he would welcome a contest. Just a month later, it looks more likely than ever that it is going to be a coronation after all. Since Tony Blair gives his intimates the impression that he has every intention of staying at Number 10 at least until next May, Gordon Brown's procession to the throne may be extremely protracted. It nevertheless looks as though the Chancellor is going to get his original and real wish: he will take over from Tony Blair without having to face any real challenge. Gordon Brown is described, pretty much unanimously, as the next Prime Minister. The composition of his cabinet and the content of his first 100 days are eagerly debated among Labour MPs. His speeches are delivered as if he is Prime Minister already in everything but name. Another illustration of this is the lengthening list of candidates to replace John Prescott. Being Number Two is apparently the summit of the ambition of many of the cabinet. Much of that contest for the deputy leadership will be seen through the prism of which of the rival candidates can work with, balance and complement Gordon Brown. An uncontested coronation will be remarkably unusual. When a party changes leader, and even more so when it means changing the leader of the country as well, there is normally a vigorous struggle for the job. It was not at all like this 30 years ago when Labour changed its leader while it was in government. When Harold Wilson quit Number 10 in March 1976, there were six candidates to replace him as Prime Minister. Denis Healey, the Chancellor, fought for it with Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, as well as Tony Benn, Tony Crosland, Michael Foot and Jim Callaghan, the Foreign Secretary. The largest figures of the cabinet battled it out in a contest that went to three ballots before it finally produced a winner in the shape of Callaghan. In contrast, it is more and more conceivable that Gordon Brown will become Prime Minister without any challenge from within the cabinet. One thing this underlines is how utterly dominant he and Tony Blair have been over the past decade of British politics. Like two monolithic trees, they cast such an overwhelming shadow over the Labour landscape that nothing else can flourish in their shade. This is also a tribute to Gordon Brown's extraordinary staying power. He has been such a formidable Chancellor that few now recall that the Treasury has more often than not been a destroyer of reputations rather than a creator of them. In the past half century, only three men have been Chancellor and gone on to become Prime Minister. Various names have been touted over the years as possible alternatives to Gordon Brown as the next Labour Prime Minister. Each and every one of them has subsequently blown up or faded away. In his own age group, no one comes close to rivalling his experience, his range or his record. A brief flurry of speculation frothed up around John Reid during the terror alert in August. There was more of it after the Home Secretary won a standing ovation for his speech to the party conference. But it seemed to me that this was based more on the desire to see some competition for the Chancellor rather than a realistic assessment of the Home Secretary's chances. One of the greatest sceptics about his prospects has always been Mr Reid himself. He can do the maths of Labour's electoral college. He has long confided to friends that he doesn't think he can beat Brown. Mr Reid has never struck me as the sort of man willingly to subject himself to a humiliating defeat. There has been another speculative bubble around Alan Johnson. The Education Secretary has the engaging personality and the working-class background to make an interesting proposition as a Prime Minister who would be an arresting contrast with the Eton and Oxford David Cameron. Some Tories say the Education Secretary is the man they'd really fear. What was in question about Mr Johnson was whether he had the ability and the appetite to make a serious bid against a man who has been preparing for Number 10 for more than 10 years. The Education Secretary fluffed his opportunity to make an impact with his party conference speech. The flip-flop over faith schools has not been exactly reputation-enhancing. Of the generation below the Chancellor, Alan Milburn retired hurt. As for the next generation down - the Labour equivalent of the Cameron generation - they have decided that the future is Brown. Whether they like it or not, it is going to be the reality and they are shaping their behaviour and planning their careers around it. Many and various have been the attempts to press David Miliband to stand. He has told those who would draft him that he has no desire to be a suicide bomber. John McDonnell, the left-wing backbencher who wants to be a leadership candidate, may struggle to get the 44 signatures he needs in order to enter the contest. If he fails, there may be no contest at all unless the Chancellor decides he needs to produce a paper candidate just to provide someone to crush. When Tony Blair declared he was going, the Labour party appeared to be faced with the longest leadership contest of all time. It looks today to have been one of the shortest contests of all time. The prospect of such a coronation for Gordon Brown leaves Labour MPs divided into three broad groups. There are those who are happy with the prospect of Prime Minister Brown and feel confident he can be the author of Labour renewal. There is a second group who are worried about what some opinion polling says about his appeal, but conclude he is so inevitable that they will have to try to make the best of it. A large number of the cabinet now fall into that category. Then there is a third group, the smallest of the three, who still seem to think he might be denied the crown. 'Someone will emerge; they have to,' one of the diehard anti-Brownites remarks to me. But who this someone is supposed to be is entirely mysterious, not least to those predicting that this elusive Stop Brown candidate will turn up. This group would matter little except for the fact that their not-so-secret leader appears to be the Prime Minister. Tony Blair had a very poor Prime Minister's Questions a fortnight ago when David Cameron taunted him to say whether or not he endorsed the Chancellor as his successor. 'Yes or no?' chortled the Tory leader. 'I do, does he?' After that squirming moment, Tony Blair was worried that the Tory leader would keep jabbing his finger into this vulnerable spot on a weekly basis. So was Gordon Brown. They are both a bit surprised that Mr Cameron has not asked the Prime Minister whether he endorses the Chancellor every Wednesday. The Blairites are now split. Some think that a Brown premiership is so certain that it is both churlish and destructive to carry on resisting it. Some of his friends have been arguing with Tony Blair that he should give his endorsement to Gordon Brown and do so quickly. The later the Prime Minister leaves it, the more he advertises his lack of enthusiasm for the idea of Prime Minister Brown and the more he damages Labour's future prospects. Tugging Mr Blair in the other direction, and speaking to the side of him which is angry with the other man, doubtful that he should be Prime Minister and still hoping an alternative might surface, are those saying that he should hold back an endorsement. I feel compelled to enter the caveat that nothing is absolutely guaranteed. Stuff happens, especially unexpected stuff. But a Brown premiership now looks as certain as anything ever is certain in politics. He would like, but he does not need, Tony Blair's endorsement to become Prime Minister. Gordon Brown looks to be where he has always planned to be: invincible and inevitable. After all those years of planning and plotting, striving and straining, all those years of waiting for the prize and worrying that someone might steal up on him from behind, the long distance runner of British politics looks over his shoulder to find that there is no one there at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
