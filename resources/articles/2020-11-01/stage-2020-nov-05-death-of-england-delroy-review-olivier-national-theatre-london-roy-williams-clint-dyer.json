But it is a second national lockdown that has forced this fine and furious monologue to shut just after it has opened. The first monologue, starring Rafe Spall and staged earlier this year, focused on white, working-class Michael as he faced up to the death of his racist father. This one dramatises the life of Michael\u2019s friend, Delroy, who was raised by his Jamaican-born mother and remained silent in that play, though his Britishness was questioned and his pro-Brexit politics mocked. Identity and belonging become the focus of Delroy\u2019s story, and he sends out his rejoinder to Michael\u2019s derision, though what initially stands out is his brash wit. Like Michael, Delroy is given unstoppable and racing powers of speech, but his outpourings are as funny as they are enraged; so, while there are knife-edge moments, they are leavened by Delroy\u2019s cheeky charisma. He pauses only to take a slug from his beer can before resuming his flow about how he got a police tag, when he met his girlfriend, Carly (who is also Michael\u2019s sister), and what has led him from his upwardly mobile, unapologetically capitalist life as a bailiff, spiralling into unemployment and drink-soaked days by himself. Michael Balogun, as Delroy, is every bit as energetic as Spall, but his performance is more compact and controlled. The play is performed in the round in a socially distanced Olivier theatre, which leaves Balogun entirely exposed; but he commands the space, moving across the stage, jumping off it or sprawling by its side, and he sets an assured pace to the monologue that stops him from becoming too antic or breathless. While the first Death of England derived from a microplay (commissioned by the Royal Court theatre and the Guardian), this sequel has some origins in the short film Dim Sum (commissioned by Headlong and the Guardian), which tracked a day in the life of a black British bailiff. Delroy here defends his right to put money above ideology (\u201cI didn\u2019t give a fuck who we evicted \u2013 black, white \u2026\u201d) and sneers at the Black Lives Matter movement: \u201cThinking they are going to make changes. Jokers.\u201d But something snaps when he is arrested and thrown into a police cell just as Carly is going into labour with their first child. Delroy has been subjected to such racial profiling since the age of 15, he tells us, but this particularly hostile encounter leads to the realisation that he can\u2019t be black British and remain apolitical. The impact of the arrest is reminiscent of Changez\u2019s inward transformation in Mohsin Hamid\u2019s The Reluctant Fundamentalist after his ignominious airport detention, though Delroy is not radicalised but politicised here. There are some excellent reflections on the power dynamics within a mixed-race relationship as Delroy\u2019s brush with the police makes him see Carly\u2019s \u201cwhite privilege\u201d differently, too. Although the play\u2019s politics touch on the events of the summer, from the killing of George Floyd to the Covid crisis and quarantine, they are integrated into the drama on the whole. The writing glitters in certain moments, while revelations and climaxes are better positioned than in the previous play. Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey and Ultz\u2019s stage design was a highlight of that show and it is again: simple yet sensational with a few mischievous surprises. Designed, like the last, in the shape of a cross, it appears bare until props are pulled out from hidden pockets. Pink helium balloons float out of the darkness as Delroy recounts one happy memory and a glitter ball emerges from nowhere to sprinkle disco light across the auditorium to mark Delroy\u2019s teenage romance with Carly. Pete Malkin and Benjamin Grant\u2019s sound design and Jackie Shemesh\u2019s lighting crank up the melodrama. Both cut through the room like a knife as we go from light to dark with blunt suddenness and slicing sounds whip around the stage. These feel simultaneously over-the-top and effective in keeping our attentions on edge. Norris, in his opening speech, pointed to cameras around the auditorium to announce that the drama would be filmed so that it could be shown to a bigger audience. It is quick and inspired thinking from the National: this play deserves a far longer life on stage and on screen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
