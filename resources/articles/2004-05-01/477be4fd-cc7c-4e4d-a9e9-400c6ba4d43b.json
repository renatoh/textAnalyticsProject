Take this list of seam bowlers: Darren Gough, Paul Hutchison, David Stiff, Alex Wharf and David Wigley. They were all once on the Yorkshire staff, yet are now plying their trade at other counties. And now add Ryan Sidebottom, who returned home for the first time to emphasise the shortcomings in Yorkshire's callow and ineffective attack. It took only a few deliveries to realise that Nottinghamshire's bowlers were operating at a different level. Immediately there was liberal lateral movement to accompany the uneven bounce. Batting looked a thoroughly awkward business. Not even the loss of Charlie Shreck to a twisted knee sustained during warm-ups could hamper Nottinghamshire, with Sidebottom the nemesis in chief with three for 19 from 14 overs. The word is that the left-armer is now able to swing the ball more readily into the right-handed batsman than before. Though that was not obvious yesterday his accuracy and potency certainly were. His most satisfying victim would have been Yorkshire's captain Craig White, whose constant flirtations outside off-stump suggested a death wish, caught at third slip. Ironically on such a seamer-friendly surface, the leg-spinner Stuart MacGill claimed most wickets. Persuading his fellow Australian Ian Harvey to pad up to his googly will have been especially pleasing for him. Jason Gallian's decision not to enforce the follow-on was surprising but he had no reason to regret it last night. When John Blain limped off after two balls, Yorkshire were so emasculated that the last session became little more than a net for David Hussey, who plundered 99 off 92 balls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
