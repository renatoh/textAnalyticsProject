A baroque lady with four rosy cheeks smiles from bed while thinking, perhaps, on her Horsepole. The 90-year-old portrait painter who writes these memoirs for Percy Shelley in 1820 has had five husbands, inadvertently travelled the Atlantic Trade Triangle, and entered her fifth marriage like an actor 'playing a Figseller when his Voice is too crackd for an Antony'. But Mrs Horsepole is not Moll Flanders; she is far more intelligent. With the conceptual vocabulary of 1820, she philosophises about verbal and visual painting. Her brush 'has never delineated such a Thing as \"the seventh Day of August\", nor ever will'. She is nearly as clever as Mr Fuller who, in eighteenth-century spirit, edits her memoir with faux-scholarly footnotes. But this novel is not just historical ventriloquism. It is an extraordinarily rich portrait of a philosopher of art. Not Only Fire Benjamin Prado transl. Sam Richard Faber \u00a310.99, pp197 Eighteen-year-old Marta goes to parties where the kids drink and snog to Sonic Youth. This could be England. But her leftist family is scarred by four decades under Franco. The baton of narrative passes between the consciousness of five characters from three generations who remember the past, or a better alternative past, or a possible future. The same events are approached several times by different characters, leading to jolts in reader perception. All the characters suffer, and not only because of fascism. Marta is hurt by love for a sexy bully, her parents by love for idealism, and Grandpa has to deal with mortality. Prado treats his characters tenderly, while he lets them suffer. At the end, after a somewhat improbable climax, unqualified love holds a flickering light to the future, which is after all worth walking into. This novel's huge popularity in Spain suggests that its concerns reverberate there today. Final Demand Deborah Moggach Vintage \u00a36.99, pp225 At first this novel seems as shallowly bright as its main protagonist. Treacherous men, petty criminals and an outrageously boring job in Leeds deal a sequence of blows to attractive accountant Natalie, 32. Aha! we think. Another contribution to the genre of thirtysomething-single-professional-woman's-anxiety fiction. But then Natalie makes her well-aimed and profitable kick against the system and suddenly we are in Manchester, with people who suffer enormously from the kick. The novel is still generic, but it also becomes a touching morality fable. It judges a girl whose moral sense is blunted by cleverness far in excess of those around her, by boredom, careless parents, rape in childhood, bad luck and corporate banality. It gives her egotistical response to life's injuries a decent and entertaining trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
