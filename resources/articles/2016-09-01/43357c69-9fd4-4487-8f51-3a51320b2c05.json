Apart from those innocent and vulnerable souls (and however much the Jolie-Pitt brood strut through their gilded, red-carpeted lives, they remain innocent and vulnerable), it seems to be a case of grab your popcorn and enjoy the spectacle. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. At base level, this is just a venal hiss of: \u201cOoh, very rich, very pretty people falling out!\u201d Celebrity divorce reimagined as a disaster movie. Pathetic rubberneckers, like myself, gobbling up the gossip, accusations and fury. Perhaps a little snort at Jennifer Aniston photographed \u201clooking solemn\u201d, as though she had imposed a smiling ban on herself, lest normal cheeriness be mistaken for spiteful joy at the news. It\u2019s a PR universe away from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, who strove to \u201cuncouple\u201d with so little acrimony or, indeed, emotion, that there were times that it came across as less a split, rather a kind of squeaky pulling apart of weak Velcro. But good for Gwynnie and Chris, right? However much we mock their efforts (leastways, the vocabulary), they behaved with dignity and protected their family. Most would agree that co-operation and mediation are best, especially when kids are involved. Sure, but on the other hand, just like regular divorce, perhaps there are some celebrity divorces that just couldn\u2019t (and maybe shouldn\u2019t) end quietly. Where the Jolie-Pitt divorce is concerned, whatever the conjecture, right now, there\u2019s no way of knowing what\u2019s true or false. However, it\u2019s widely accepted that it was Jolie who initiated the divorce and in such a determined manner that there could be no hope of pretending that it was amicable. In this way, it\u2019s reminiscent of 2016\u2019s other Big Blockbuster Divorce \u2013 between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Then, Heard was widely branded a \u201cgolddigger!\u201d, scrabbling for a \u201cbig pay day\u201d. Such was the venom directed at her, I felt at the time that I\u2019d inadvertently signed up for a crash course in synchronised global misogyny. A big cheer, then, for Heard, the big ol\u2019 golddigging slut, for announcing that all her settlement money would go to charity. The Jolie-Pitt divorce is totally different. (Just one of the ways it\u2019s different is that no one could pelt \u201cgolddigger\u201d mud at Jolie.) However, there could be said to be a core similarity in the way that both women initiated divorce proceedings and both seemed defiant about making a lot of noise. While ugly celebrity bust-ups are nothing new, there still seems to be a fresh feminist-flavoured attitude, a sense of rebellion here. It\u2019s a little acknowledged fact that sometimes huge status and wealth can trap a person. Put into context, this is a world where fame and money tend to calm things down, smooth things over, at least on the surface. The main (lawyered/PR-ed/micromanaged) onus is on control and its smiling twin, damage limitation \u2013 managing and protecting the famous faces and their highly lucrative brands. Even when both parties are famous, it takes a certain courage to use that very fact not to soothe, calm and conceal, but almost as an accelerant. This is why, while there\u2019s much to be said for the measured, mediated approach (not least for any children involved), I find Heard and now Jolie\u2019s brand of bolshiness noteworthy and fascinating. I\u2019m not suggesting they have anything in common with the powerless or penniless who divorce, but that\u2019s the point \u2013 women like them appear to be rebelling against the controlling A-list status quo (speak no evil/tweet no evil\u201d?) and accepting the public censure that comes with that. Maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for women with fiery gobs and a refusal to go quietly, indeed, do anything quietly. Messy it might be, but there\u2019s no denying the spirit. In Liverpool, it seems, you\u2019ll never walk alone The 96 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster have been given the freedom of the city of Liverpool. It\u2019s the first time this honour has been given posthumously and also receiving the awards were Liverpool FC manager at the time of the tragedy, Kenny Dalglish and his wife, Marina (who have supported the families throughout), plus Professor Phil Scraton, whose campaigning helped keep the fight for justice alive. The bereaved families were cheered and applauded as they received the awards in what was described as an \u201cemotional\u201d ceremony. I bet it was. These honours are a lovely gesture that says a lot about Liverpool. The most bittersweet of \u201cvictories\u201d, Hillsborough wasn\u2019t only about getting justice for those who were killed, it was also about spirit in the face of impossible odds and Liverpool showed it had guts to burn. Time and again, over the years, Liverpudlians have received stick for being over-emotional, melodramatic and the rest, when it seems to me that all the people there do is try to stick up for each other. Liverpool is a true flagship city for community spirit and should be applauded for that. Whingers should try self-control too An Italian man has brought a case against the Emirates airline after being forced to sit next to an obese passenger on a nine-hour flight. The man says that he tried to move seats but was told that he couldn\u2019t and that he wasn\u2019t offered compensation or an apology. These stories happen periodically and they always make me angry \u2013 on behalf of the people being complained about. Obviously space can be an issue on planes and it\u2019s uncomfortable feeling squashed, especially on a long flight. However, hasn\u2019t this got a lot more to do with some airlines not giving passengers enough room in the first place? Then there\u2019s the ethical dimension of whether people want to place their temporary personal comfort above basic decency, by insulting and humiliating another human being in this way. I\u2019d rather plunge my face into boiling tar than be the reason an overweight person gets to feel terrible about themselves that day. Overweight people are always being told to exercise self-control over their eating habits \u2013 how about their tormentors thinking about exercising their own self-control, over their manners? I\u2019ve written before that such levels of intolerance could swiftly get out of control both on aircrafts and in wider society. (Overweight people first, then start on the next vulnerable group?) Generally, it\u2019s often suggested that the obese person needs to buy an extra aeroplane seat to accommodate their girth, as if money was no object. How about flipping this so that the people complaining are the ones who need to buy the extra seats, to accommodate their bad attitudes? If the thin and judgmental are so precious about their \u201cpersonal space\u201d, then they should be the ones shelling out for extra seats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
