A pretty brilliant game, decided by a pretty brilliant goal, from a pretty brilliant player. Diego Simeone\u2019s side will count themselves desperately hard done by because they had Barcelona on the ropes for the first half an hour. After that there was nothing to separate the two teams, other than that late flash of individual magic. But that\u2019s why he\u2019s the best in the world. That\u2019s all from me - thanks for reading! 93 mins: Free-kick to Atletico, given away by a desperate Messi slide tackle next to his own corner flag. Oblak trots up \u2013 and Trippier\u2019s delivery is headed his way, but Barcelona\u2019s 11-man defence heads clear before it gets there. And that it! 92 mins: Oblak sends the ball high into the Barca area, but it\u2019s headed out. There follows a round of pinball inside the area, and Koke\u2019s cross-shot is eventually saved. 90 mins: Three minutes of injury time. 89 mins: Barcelona are defending for their lives now, 11 men behind the ball, backs to the wall. An Atletico corner is half-cleared to Messi, who batters an aimless hoof high into the stands. Lovely to see. 85 mins: Messi is being funnelled down the right whenever he picks up the ball 86 mins: Messi picks up the ball in the inside-right channel and, for the first time this match, manages to jink inside his man. Approaching the edge of the box, he exchanges a crisp one-two with Suarez, and sweeps a first-time shot into the bottom corner. Simple but utterly brilliant. 82 mins: Messi tries to slide Junior in, but the pass gets away from him and goes out for a goal kick. Some changes: Vidal has come on for Arthur, and Lemar for Correa. And now Umtiti for Pique. 78 mins: Vitolo and Pique go screeching into a full-blooded 50/50, with the centre-back coming off worse. He rolls around for a long time, gets up, goes down again, rolls around, limps off the pitch, then limps gingerly back on. 76 mins: The Trippier/Morata combo clicks into gear again, the full-back bending a pass down the line and into his striker\u2019s path, who gets off a volley under pressure, but it\u2019s well over. 72 mins: Off the line! Correa hares into the box and fires in a low cross, which Morata meets with a backheeled flick \u2013 but Lenglet is waiting on to slice clear. 71 mins: Pique, already on a booking, goes sliding recklessly in on Morata, who\u2019s haring down the left, and gets nowhere near the ball, sending Morata sprawling to the ground. The referee takes a long hard look\u2026 and gives only a free-kick. Laughable! Gerard Pique you lucky man! 68 mins: Thomas spread the ball to the onrushing Trippier down the right, whose cross is blocked. The corner is half-cleared, sent back into the corridor of uncertainty \u2013 but no one can get a touch \u2013 before Barca spring a lightning break, Messi bustling through all sorts of fouls before laying off to Suarez, who chips square to Griezmann, who volleys wildly over. Vitolo is booked for the foul on Messi. 64 mins: All of a sudden the game has become wide open, another clearcut chance for Barcelona, Messi\u2019s side-foot effort saved after he meets De Jong\u2019s cutback, before Pique stretches desperately to prevent Joao Felix running clean through. Then Barca attack again, Suarez firing over. Joao Felix is taken off for Vitolo \u2013 not a change the home crowd approves of. 60 mins: Messi takes aim from 20 yards and rifles in a low drive, which Oblak gets down to before smothering the follow-up. 59 mins: De Jong picks up possession on halfway and sashays forward \u2013 and Griezmann is clean through in the inside-left if only he can pick him out! But he takes an age to spot the pass, and when he does he overhits it horribly, much to his teammate\u2019s anguish. 55 mins: Barca are turning the screw now \u2013 but then out of nothing, a brilliant counterattack from the hosts, Herrera stealing possession and sidestepping his way through a crowd in midfield before unleashing Morata down the left. He scoots forward, draws the defender, and squares to Thomas, but his shot is saved. This is one hell of a nil-nil. 53 mins: Messi prowls around the edge of the area, looking for an opening that isn\u2019t quite there. Eventually Morata steams back to dispossess him, and Atletico spring a counter down the right, cut short by a great sliding challenge from Lenglet. 48 mins: Barcelona are really dominating the ball now, but they can\u2019t get anywhere with it, with every pass into a dangerous area cut out, every dribble crowded out. Atletico are taking every opportunity to break quickly and in numbers. This may be how the second half will play out. 47 mins: Barcelona get us restarted with a bit of ball-hogging, before Griezmann unleashes from range, comfortably saved. Cue whistles. Anyway, we\u2019re back in action. Barcelona kick off. Re: the kit. It\u2019s not good, clearly. But by the standards of football kits, is it that bad? It\u2019s arguably not even the worst Barca kit, which for my money was this tequila-sunrise number a few years back: \u201cWhat is it with the design of this Barcelona alternate/third jersey?,\u201d asks Peter Oh. \u201cWere they going for a scratched-by-a-velociraptor look?\u201d (Also known as the Bob Peck?) Terrific half. Plenty of wonderfully assured play from both sides, and no shortage of chances all round. All that\u2019s missing is, well, a goal. 44 mins: The first glimpse of Messi\u2019s latent capacity to take out an entire team single-handedly \u2013 he dribbles around the edge of the box, encircled by defenders, but keeps the ball like a magnet. He plays it wide and looks for the return, but doesn\u2019t get it. Roberto\u2019s high cross comes to nothing. 42 mins: Barca hit the bar! Pique with the perfect mirror-image to the chance Morata had a minute before, meeting an outswinging corner. He heads the ball down, too, but it bounces up against the crossbar. 40 mins: Another phenomenal piece of goalkeeping from Ter Stegen, clawing away a header from Morata, who met a corner with a towering leap. He headed it powerfully downwards, and it bounced right in front of Ter Stegen, who readjusted brilliantly to scoop it away. 38 mins: Atletico are playing it out from the back with astounding calm, but here they lose the ball in midfield and a lovely bit of one-touch play from Barcelona sees Griezmann lay off to Suarez 25 yards out, and the Uruguayan unleashes a fearsome half-volley that flashes just wide. 35 mins: More brilliance from Arthur, wriggling away from Herrera and pinging a lovely ball up to Messi, who has two men to beat and can only win a corner, which he overhits wildly. 32 mins: Arthur, who is growing into the game, bursts forward and feeds Messi, who is tackled(!). Morata tries to break clear but is rugby tackled by Rakitic, who absurdly escapes a booking. Seconds later, Pique repeats the trick on Joao Felix, and does get a yellow. 29 mins: Barcelona have woken up. They play some of their old keep-ball, which comes to an end when Griezmann thunders into a slide tackle, to a deafening chorus of whistles. This is a high-class game. 26 mins: Great chance for Barcelona! They should be ahead, Messi nicking the ball off off a fast-asleep Herrera and squaring for the Croatian, but the pass forces him just away from goal and he can\u2019t quite get the purchase on the shot. Saved. 24 mins: More purposeful attacking from the hosts, who work the ball beautifully down the left but can\u2019t quite work a clearcut chance. Barca\u2019s counterattack is snuffed out instantly, and Atletico turn the screw again with Herrera bending one wide from just inside the box. They\u2019re all over Barcelona here. 22 mins: Atletico steal possession in the final third and have a great chance to spring a four-on-three attack, but Correa gets his pass all wrong. Will they come to regret these moments\u2026? 19 mins: Koke puts in the cross, cleared, but it comes back in to the back post where Joao Felix is waiting, practically underneath the crossbar, and has to score! He takes the volley with his side-foot, but it hits a star-jumping Ter Stegen on the inside of his thigh, trickles across the goal line and out for a corner. Unbelievable! 18 mins: Another free-kick to Atletico, this time right on the edge of the box, Junior wrestling Correa to the ground. 16 mins: Trippier whips in a beauty of a delivery, met aggressively by a rising Felipe whose header goes over. That could \u2013 should? \u2013 have been a goal. 16 mins: The teams are taking turns to keep the ball and slowly move forward. Atletico are doing more with the possession, though, and Trippier looks for Morata again with a cross, which is cleared, before winning a free-kick out wide. 12 mins: Barca enjoy their first sustained spell of possession, but they meet a brick wall each time they try any really penetrative passing. De Jong tries something different, running in behind from midfield, but he\u2019s eased away from the ball by a vigilant Hermoso. 9 mins: Atletico are on top here, and are getting joy down their right. He feeds a lovely pass into the box to Morata, who holds off Pique, swivels and fires in a shot that needs saving. Corner. 6 mins: Trippier picks out Correa down the right, who wins a corner. After a scrambled clearance, it breaks wide to Hermoso, and his driven cross hits first Lenglet and then the far post. That could have gone anywhere. 5 mins: Herrera intercepts a Suarez pass and stays ice-cool under pressure from De Jong to play it out from the back. Nice. But Barca are pressing with vigour. 3 mins: The stadium erupts in fierce whistles as Griezmann gets his first touch. No real rhythm to either side\u2019s play so far: it\u2019s been belting it down here, and the pitch it soaking. 1 min: And we\u2019re off. Thomas Partey belts it into the mixer, and Atletico win a series of throw-ins, ending when Morata tries a ludicrously hopeful long ranger that trickles wide. The teams are out. Handshakes are exchanged and the managers share a friendly hug. That\u2019s the niceties over with. So Antoine Griezmann starts \u2013 replacing the injured Ousmane Dembele \u2013 but with Ivan Rakitic coming in for the suspended Sergio Busquets, we have a Barcelona midfield with precisely none of the Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets trio that pretty much defined the club\u2019s previous decade and a half. Which isn\u2019t exactly new, but is still weird. An attacking lineup from Simeone, too, with both Joao Felix and Alvaro Morata up top \u2013 they\u2019ll fancy their chances against this Barca defence. But will Atletico look to take the game to the visitors (which is what Barcelona are least comfortable dealing with), or soak up the pressure and spring on the counter (which is what they are most comfortable doing)? Some pre-match reading, from Sid Lowe, on the strange riddle of Barcelona: Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Trippier, Hermoso, Felipe, Sa\u00fal; Correa, Herrera, Thomas, Koke; Joao F\u00e9lix, Morata Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Roberto, Lenglet, Piqu\u00e9, Junior Firpo; Rakitic, Arthur, De Jong; Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Griezmann Are Barcelona European football\u2019s weirdest team? For a start, they\u2019re nothing like the tirelessly scurrying, ball-hogging, even-greater-than-the-sum-of-their-parts team that we became used to for so many years. Instead, this lot are a tad scruffy in possession. Not the most willing pressers. And reliant on flashes of individual magic rather than the slow asphyxiation of collective dominance. Nothing wrong with that, except it doesn\u2019t leave you much to fall back on if your big men don\u2019t turn up. Luckily Barcelona have a big man who rarely fails to turn up \u2013 although even Lionel Messi is raising more than his fair share of questions this season: does his brilliance when he has the ball justify his doing absolutely nothing when he doesn\u2019t? And at what point does the repeated struggles of the forwards brought in to play alongside him start to point towards an awkward common denominator? So far, Barcelona have been muddling along with a Keeganesque \u201cYou score four, we\u2019ll score five\u201d approach, but today they meet their direct opposites in Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who have the best defence in the league but the lowest-scoring attack outside the bottom six. Unstoppable force? Immoveable object? Victory for these sides\u2019 common enemy last night means that Bar\u00e7a must win to reclaim top spot, while a win for Atl\u00e9tico would draw them level on points with their opponents. Last year, it took a last-minute goal from Ousmane Dembele to deny them the win \u2013 but last year they could also count on Antoine Griezmann, whose summer defection means he lines up for the visitors tonight. What more motivation should Diego Simeone\u2019s men need? Strap in. Kick-off 8pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
