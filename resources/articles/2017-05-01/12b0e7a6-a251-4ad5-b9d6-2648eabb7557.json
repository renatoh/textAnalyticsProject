The 26-year-old victim died on Friday afternoon following reports of an altercation in Peckham Rye. Video and pictures posted online showed four police cars and several officers at the scene, close to Peckham Rye rail and overground station, following the incident. Police said on Monday they had arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of murder and a 28-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender. DCI Dave Whellams said: \u201cWe believe the victim was involved in an altercation with another person prior to being stabbed. The incident drew a large crowd of onlookers and a number of members of the public were filming the incident on their phones. \u201cI am appealing directly to any witnesses \u2013 and in particular any of those people who have recorded footage \u2013 to contact police as soon as possible.\u201d The results of a post-mortem showed the victim had been stabbed in the chest and arm, police said. Next of kin have been informed, but officers are awaiting formal identification. Alim Komora told the Evening Standard he had known the victim, Bilal Kargbo, 26, since primary school. \u201cThere is nothing bad that I can say about him,\u201d he said of Kargbo, who was originally from Sierra Leone. He became the sixth person to be fatally stabbed in London in a week. Meanwhile, a man has been charged with murder following a stabbing on a London bus. Archie Sheppard, 48, was found fatally injured on the top deck of a bus in Marylebone in the early hours of Friday morning after suffering a \u201cviolent and sustained\u201d attack. Paramedics were called to the No 189 bus in Gloucester Place but Sheppard, from Neasden, north-west London, was pronounced dead at the scene. Scotland Yard said John Doherty, 38, had been charged with murder and two counts of possession of an offensive weapon. Doherty, from Fulham in west London, appeared at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court on Monday. He was remanded in custody and will appear next at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. A man has been charged following another stabbing on Thursday at Dulwich Park in south-east London.
