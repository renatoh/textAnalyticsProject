For Major's 1992 cones initiative (quietly dropped in 1995) read Brown's loft insulation. For the Tory hotline read Labour's coldline when the weather gets really nasty. There will be grants, helpful tips, TV adverts, even a booklet which can be burned in colder emergencies. All this and more was announced as part of a \u00a31bn energy package at Brown's monthly press conference yesterday, staged during another of those ferocious Downing St downpours which have become routine this summer. It was pretty wet outside too. \"Welcome back, I hope you had a good summer,\" the boss told the hacks with boilerplate insincerity. \"I managed to get some good weather during my holiday in England.\" (Hint: Cameron went to Turkey). And so it proceeded. In the next hour Brown was invited to attack Sarkozy (\"Isn't he doing well?\" the hacks kept reminding him) or Australia's Kevin Rudd; to sack David Miliband and Alistair Darling; declare war on Iran; or disembowel himself for getting so much wrong since last September. He sidestepped all such offers, though the words \"I do take responsibility\" did pass through gritted teeth. Periodically, like sunshine after rain, a smile would break across his face as if by remote control and for no apparent reason. Nor did he look especially well rested, not really brown at all. That may be the secret of Gordon's ability to take the punishment. Adversity never gets him down: he's down already. Yesterday's energy package was admirable in its way. So was the cones hotline. What both failed to do was match public expectations. As winter engulfs Britain, how much warmer will freezing grannies feel knowing they may get their cavity walls filled for free if they survive until April, the hacks wanted to know. And what about that on-off windfall tax? What about energy bills rising NOW? The government's plans sounded like \"jam tomorrow\" suggested one uppity BBC reporter. The PM told his tormentors - more than once - that he does not expect the energy companies' \u00a3910m contribution to the Warmer Britain Fund to be passed on to customers, though he was mild and vague - King Lear on Prozac - about what he would do if it is. John Hutton was more menacing. The PM appeared at the No 10 podium (\"Save money, Save energy, Save Gordon\" the logo should have read) flanked by Hutton and Hilary Benn. Were they the cabinet prison warders or his hostages? The herbivorous Benn was clearly there to play the soft warder while Hutton, wild-eyed at the very thought of energy profiteering, was Mr Hard. Any proof of that and he'd promised to come down on profiteers \"like a tonne of bricks\". The idea of getting energy monopolists on the rack in a Whitehall basement clearly excites him. For the first time it was possible to imagine that the man to deliver bad news indeed to Gordon might not be Jack Straw, but John Hutton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
