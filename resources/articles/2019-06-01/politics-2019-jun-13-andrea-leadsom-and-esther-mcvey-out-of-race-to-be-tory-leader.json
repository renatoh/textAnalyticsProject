The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson comfortably topped the poll as expected, securing the support of 114 of his Tory colleagues \u2013 well above the 105 he would need to guarantee a place in the final two. Leadsom promised \u201cdecisive and compassionate leadership\u201d at her launch this week, and McVey said she would make the Tory party more representative of working-class voters. Both women hoped their reputation as staunch Brexiters would help to win over their colleagues, but they were swept away by the carefully planned \u201cBack Boris\u201d campaign. The former chief whip Mark Harper was also eliminated. He launched his campaign this week offering to create \u201ca party where everyone is invited\u201d. Seven men remain in the race. McVey said: \u201cI am pleased to have had a platform to make the case for blue-collar Conservatism, a clean break from the EU and the need to invest money into schools, policing and a proper pay rise for our public sector workers.\u201d Some of those who are entitled to go through to the next round, including Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid, are likely to come under pressure to withdraw and throw their weight behind one of the frontrunners. But there was little sign of wavering after the results were announced. Raab, who secured 27 votes, said: \u201cI\u2019m proud and honoured to have the support of so many brilliant colleagues today. This campaign is just getting started and we\u2019ve got a good base to build on.\u201d Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, who is supporting Javid, said the home secretary had come in a \u201cstrong fifth place\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all to play for,\u201d he said after the vote. \u201cThe public figures were 17 to 19 votes, and Sajid got 23. The momentum\u2019s building up. We\u2019ve got Ruth Davidson on our side, so we\u2019re really happy.\u201d Amber Rudd, who is backing Jeremy Hunt, denied that it was disappointing to see him so far behind Johnson. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cHe came a good second, he got more than Matt and Saj combined, and that\u2019s what we were after \u2013 a clear lead in second place. It\u2019s only the first round, there\u2019s a few more rounds to go. I\u2019m delighted.\u201d Conservative MPs, including Theresa May and the 10 leadership candidates, were given a two-hour window to cast their votes in a House of Commons committee room. The prime minister declined to say who she had voted for. Leadsom, McVey and another underdog, Rory Stewart, stationed themselves in the corridor in the hope of winning over waverers. The contenders who failed to reach the threshold of 17 MPs were automatically eliminated, under newly introduced rules aimed at preventing a drawn-out contest. Stewart just made the cut with 19 supporters. Afterwards he insisted: \u201cWe can win this. Realism, action, unity, trust.\u201d Brexit has dominated the campaign, with Johnson promising to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d. He has won over many of the party\u2019s leavers, including the Eurosceptic stalwarts Steve Baker, Iain Duncan Smith and Mark Francois. Outside the vote on Thursday, another Brexiter, John Redwood, said he was also supporting Johnson. \u201cHe\u2019s rightly said that the surrender document, or withdrawal treaty, is dead and that if necessary we will leave without an agreement on the 31 October,\u201d he said. Another ballot will now be held next Tuesday, with further rounds to follow on Wednesday and possibly Thursday, until the field is narrowed to two. Their names will then be presented to Conservative members in a postal ballot, with the winner due to be announced in the week of 21 July. The new prime minister will have just three months to prepare for Brexit by the Halloween deadline set by EU27 leaders. Johnson\u2019s progress into the final round now appears unstoppable unless he makes a significant misstep, and the fiercest battle is between Hunt, Michael Gove and Javid for the second place on the ballot. Hunt was narrowly ahead with 43 votes in the first round, against Gove\u2019s 37 and Javid\u2019s 23, and the candidates\u2019 focus will now turn to winning the second preferences of their eliminated rivals. Rudd, who is supporting Hunt, said once the race was down to a final two it would \u201cstart again\u201d in hustings to members, in which \u201canything can happen\u201d. May will remain in 10 Downing Street until her successor is chosen, at which point her three-year tenure as prime minister will come to an end. The contest was triggered after her final compromise offer on Brexit \u2013 including the promise of a House of Commons vote on a second referendum \u2013 infuriated Tory colleagues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
