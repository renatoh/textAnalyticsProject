She was in her 20s and had been working as a geographer in London away from her native Ireland. She spent a year in Dublin with her family, then accepted an academic position on the west coast, near Westport in County Mayo. \u201cI thought: \u2018I need to go and get my head cleared in this place, to be blown away by the wind and nature.\u2019\u201d Kelly bought a little house in a remote area and surfed, swam and walked a three-mile-long beach twice a day. \u201cI guess the five or six years that I spent there on the wild Atlantic coast just healed me, really.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand why that might be until some years later, when she started to see scientific literature that proved what she had long felt intuitively to be true: that she felt much better by the sea. For the past eight years, Kelly has been based in Brighton, researching \u201coutdoor wellbeing\u201d and the therapeutic effects of nature \u2013 particularly of water. In recent years, stressed-out urbanites have been seeking refuge in green spaces, for which the proven positive impacts on physical and mental health are often cited in arguments for more inner-city parks and accessible woodlands. The benefits of \u201cblue space\u201d \u2013 the sea and coastline, but also rivers, lakes, canals, waterfalls, even fountains \u2013 are less well publicised, yet the science has been consistent for at least a decade: being by water is good for body and mind. Proximity to water \u2013 especially the sea \u2013 is associated with many positive measures of physical and mental wellbeing, from higher levels of vitamin D to better social relations. \u201cMany of the processes are exactly the same as with green space \u2013 with some added benefits,\u201d says Dr Mathew White, a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth, a programme researching the health and wellbeing benefits of blue space across 18 (mostly European) countries. An extensive 2013 study on happiness in natural environments \u2013 to White\u2019s mind, \u201cone of the best ever\u201d \u2013 prompted 20,000 smartphone users to record their sense of wellbeing and their immediate environment at random intervals. Marine and coastal margins were found by some distance to be the happiest locations, with responses approximately six points higher than in a continuous urban environment. The researchers equated it to \u201cthe difference between attending an exhibition and doing housework\u201d. Although living within 1km (0.6 miles) of the coast \u2013 and to a lesser extent, within 5km (3.1 miles) \u2013 has been associated with better general and mental health, it seems to be the propensity to visit that is key. \u201cWe find people who visit the coast, for example, at least twice weekly tend to experience better general and mental health,\u201d says Dr Lewis Elliott, also of the University of Exeter and BlueHealth. \u201cSome of our research suggests around two hours a week is probably beneficial, across many sectors of society.\u201d Even sea views have been associated with better mental health. White says there are three established pathways by which the presence of water is positively related to health, wellbeing and happiness. First, there are the beneficial environmental factors typical of aquatic environments, such as less polluted air and more sunlight. Second, people who live by water tend to be more physically active \u2013 not just with water sports, but walking and cycling. Third \u2013 and this is where blue space seems to have an edge over other natural environments \u2013 water has a psychologically restorative effect. White says spending time in and around aquatic environments has consistently been shown to lead to significantly higher benefits, in inducing positive mood and reducing negative mood and stress, than green space does. People of all socioeconomic groups go to the coast to spend quality time with friends and family. Dr Sian Rees, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth, says the coastline is Britain\u2019s \u201cmost socially levelling environment\u201d, whereas forests tend to be accessed by high-income earners. \u201cIt\u2019s not seen as being elite or a special place, it\u2019s where we just go and have fun. \u201cBy spending time in these environments, you\u2019re getting what we call \u2018health by stealth\u2019 \u2013 enjoying the outdoors, interacting with the physical environment \u2013 and that also has some different health benefits.\u201d Even a fountain may do. A 2010 study (of which White was lead author) found that images of built environments containing water were generally rated just as positively as those of only green space; researchers suggested that the associated soundscape and the quality of light on water might be enough to have a restorative effect. Although participants rated large bodies of water higher than other aquatic environments (and \u201cswampy areas\u201d were rated significantly less positively), the study suggested that any water is better than none \u2013 presenting opportunities for beneficial blue space to be designed or retrofitted. \u201cYou can\u2019t change where the coast is, but when we\u2019re talking about translating the benefits to other types of environments, there is nothing to stop a well-designed urban fountain,\u201d says Elliott. \u201cPeople work with what they have,\u201d says Kelly. When she lived in London, she would head for the Thames when she had a spare 10 minutes \u201cand recalibrate\u201d. Then, four times a year, she would go to Brighton \u201cand the benefits would keep me going for the next few months \u2013 so I didn\u2019t get into a place of being overwhelmed or stressed, just keeping myself topped up\u201d. The coast does seem to be especially effective, however. White suggests this is due to the ebb and flow of the tides. He points out that rumination \u2013 focusing on negative thoughts about one\u2019s distress \u2013 is an established factor in depression. \u201cWhat we find is that spending time walking on the beach, there\u2019s a transition towards thinking outwards towards the environment, thinking about those patterns \u2013 putting your life in perspective, if you like.\u201d When you are sailing, surfing or swimming, says White, \u201cyou\u2019re really in tune with natural forces there \u2013 you have to understand the motion of the wind, the movement of the water\u201d. By being forced to concentrate on the qualities of the environment, we access a cognitive state honed over millennia. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of getting back in touch with our historical heritage, cognitively.\u201d Water is, quite literally, immersive. As well as an academic, Kelly is a wellness practitioner who teaches classes in \u201cmindfulness by the sea\u201d. She says the sea has a meditative quality \u2013 whether it is crashing or still, or you are in the water or observing from the shore. \u201cYou can immerse yourself in it, which you can\u2019t really do with a green space. You\u2019re present in that moment, you\u2019re looking at something with intention, and whether that\u2019s for two minutes or half an hour, it gives you the benefits in that moment.\u201d In the future, she believes time in blue space will be a mainstream, formalised response. \u201cThe mental health crisis isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she says. Rees says support for the idea of \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d prescriptions for individuals is growing. A \u201csurfing for mental health\u201d group in north Devon is one example she gives of how \u201cnature-based interventions\u201d can work. By working to characterise and quantify benefits, BlueHealth\u2019s cross-disciplinary team hopes to establish how \u201cblue infrastructure\u201d \u2013 the coast, rivers, inland lakes \u2013 can help tackle major public health challenges such as obesity, physical inactivity and mental health disorders. A 2016 paper \u2013 which White co-authored \u2013 put the monetary value of the health benefit of engaging with the marine environment at \u00a3176m. Harnessing the power of blue space could also potentially help to alleviate inequality. \u201cOne of our recent papers finds that the benefits of coastal living are strongest for people living in the poorest areas,\u201d says Elliott. For that reason, it is crucial to ensure everyone has access. With proximity to water associated with at least a 10% premium in house prices, White is concerned by the exclusivity of seaside urban development. \u201cWhat will happen is you\u2019ll get this kind of gentrification, where the people who benefit most will get squeezed inland.\u201d Access provisions under the revised Marine and Coastal Access Act, which is due to be completed next year, will help, says White. But seaside communities are particularly vulnerable, imminently from seasonal fluctuations in income and environmental degradation, and, in the longer term, sea level rise and extreme weather due to climate change. Rees says that the benefits of marine environments for our wellbeing are tied to the health of those environments, and that conservation efforts need to factor in the \u201cnatural capital\u201d of blue space in supporting our wellbeing. Kelly\u2019s work has found a link between a sense of personal connection to the sea and environmentally friendly behaviours; researchers hope that we may be more inclined to protect blue space if the health benefits are proven. \u201cTo go to the sea is synonymous with letting go,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cIt could be lying on a beach or somebody handing you a cocktail. For somebody else, it could be a wild, empty coast. But there is this really human sense of: \u2018Oh, look, there\u2019s the sea\u2019 \u2013 and the shoulders drop.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
