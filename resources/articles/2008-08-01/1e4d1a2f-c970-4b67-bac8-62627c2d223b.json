The bodies of the two men were found yesterday by a guide, partially covered by snow, at 4,000m on Monte Rosa in the Valle D'Aosta region where high wind had pushed temperatures down below minus 10C overnight. The 70-year-old Briton, Reginald Clarke, from London, set out from the Quintino Sella mountain refuge on Friday morning, despite forecasts of bad weather, accompanied by a Dutchman in his forties, aiming to scale the peak of Naso del Lyskamm. 'They were probably heading back down to the Gnifetti refuge when they became lost on the glacier in the storm, which at that elevation would have been impossible to survive,' said Adriano Favre, head of rescue services in the Valle D'Aosta region. Two other mountaineers died earlier this month while hiking on Monte Rosa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
