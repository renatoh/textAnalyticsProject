But Studs Terkel belongs to a gentler age, an era when interviewers said things like: 'What a tour de force that was. How did you carry that off?' and graciously kept quiet while their subjects rambled on about the creative subtleties of their art. In his new collection of film and theatre interviews, Terkel is so terribly polite, so scrupulously respectful, that I imagine he's the kind of man who apologises when he misses a shot at tennis. His opening gambit to actress Carol Channing when he meets her in 1959 is: 'You have a sparkle and intelligence ...' She does not demur. This old-fashioned gentility has served Terkel well. At 96, he is America's pre-eminent oral historian, a man who has devoted his life to getting people to tell him their stories. But his greatest strength is in conveying the experience of ordinary people, in getting them to elucidate the everyday grind of survival. His 1970 book, Hard Times, is deemed by many to be the quintessential oral history of the Great Depression. He has recorded interviews about work, war and race. In 1985, he won the Pulitzer Prize. Terkel's interview technique is self-deprecating and subtle - he removes himself from the foreground in order to allow his subject space to breathe. Reading a classic Terkel interview is a bit like looking at a pointillist painting: close up, it is merely a conglomeration of dots, but taken as a whole, a more arresting and cohesive picture forms itself. In his recent memoir, Touch and Go, Terkel attributes his success '[to] having celebrated the lives of the uncelebrated'. The trouble with interviewing famous actors or directors is that they are already celebrated and, if allowed to, can wallow in pretension like hippos in pools of mud. While Terkel's decision to let his interviewees speak for themselves (and never to ask them about their private lives) is an admirable one, the results in this collection can be hit and miss. Occasionally, as with the insufferably pompous Marlon Brando, it pays spectacular dividends. 'Perhaps it is out of respect for what it means to be an artist that I do not call myself one,' says Brando, unaware that Terkel has handed him a long spool of rope with which to hang himself. But it is a less fruitful technique when discussing the intricacies of a chorus-line folk dance in Oklahoma - unless, of course, you're particularly enthused by that sort of thing. Part of the problem is that Terkel himself has an encyclopaedic knowledge of almost everything and sometimes gets sidetracked by obscure, arcane tangents. I know I should be interested in the theme of human bestiality in the theatre of the absurd, but reading a verbatim Q&amp;A transcript about it for 10 pages feels a bit like revising for a BTEC in performing arts. When he hits his stride, however, Terkel elicits some fascinating insights into some of the greatest names of stage and screen, among them Tennessee Williams, Marcel Marceau, Ian McKellen and, um, Arnold Schwarzenegger. 'When I was a small boy,' recalls the future governor of California, 'my dream was not to be big physically, but big in a way that everybody listens to me when I talk, that I'm a very important person, that people recognise me and see me as something special. I had a big need for being singled out.' Buster Keaton, interviewed in 1960, talks about a 'friendly contest' he had with Charlie Chaplin to see who could produce a silent feature film with the fewest subtitles. 'He had this picture down to something like 21 titles. I had 23. The average picture had 240 titles. The most I ever used was 56.' The most perceptive and interesting passages come when Terkel is firmly on home ground. An extraordinary chapter deals with the varied audience reaction to some of the first performances of Waiting for Godot. When Alan Schneider directed the play in Miami, half of the well-heeled, white audience walked out. But when it was staged by a company of African-American actors in small Southern towns at the height of the civil-rights movement, the predominantly black audience felt an immediate and natural empathy for Beckett's tramps. 'Our audience knew a great deal about waiting,' recalls Gilbert Moses, the then director of Free Southern Theatre. 'They had been waiting all their lives [ ...] When Gogo takes off his shoe - a simple thing - and complains about its being too tight, the laughter of recognition bursts forth.' This is what Terkel communicates most beautifully - the simple things, the ordinary people. For all that he might reveal about showbiz, I can't help but feel that he's too good to waste his time on the Terminator."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
