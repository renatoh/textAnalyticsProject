Unaware that snatches of his conversation could be overheard, the former England captain once memorably, and scathingly, slated Jonas Guti\u00e9rrez's crossing ability. Twenty four months on the Argentinian winger, now urged on by another manager called Alan, surged repeatedly down the left wing against Manchester United but this time the touchline mood music sounded considerably more approving. Direct, dangerous, strong, speedy and, above all, largely accurate when it came to delivery, Guti\u00e9rrez created some decent first-half chances, won free-kicks and gave John O'Shea a night to remember for mostly uncomfortable reasons. Although still erratic at times he has improved beyond all measure since that deconstruction by Shearer as Newcastle headed for a season in the Championship. A big part of the credit for this renaissance belongs to Chris Hughton but Guti\u00e9rrez's game appears to have been sharpened under Alan Pardew's quietly convincing management. Along with Shola Ameobi, Joey Barton, Fabricio Coloccini and Jos\u00e9 Enrique in particular, he belongs to a group of players who have improved appreciably in recent months. If Newcastle squad members are offered freedom to improvise on the pitch, precious little 'off the cuff' happens away from it these days. Pardew provides every player with a personalised pre-match dossier highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the next opponents. Not content with relying on the written word, Newcastle's staff augment such information with individual DVD's highlighting rivals' tricks and tactics. The burning of all this midnight oil bore fruit here as Cheik Tiot\u00e9's midfield discipline frequently succeeded in suppressing Wayne Rooney's threat. In a wider context it has helped a squad lacking real strength in depth \u2013 not to mention natural left-footers \u2013 compensate for Andy Carroll's potentially season-defining defection to Liverpool in January. Making the most of the resources at his disposal, Pardew has been forced to experiment, on one recent occasion relocating the impressive Coloccini from centre-half to midfield, but he has not merely taken tactical risks. The recent suspension of Kevin Nolan, Newcastle's influential captain, prompted the leap of faith involved in a temporary handing of the armband to Barton. Admittedly the midfielder's crossing and set-piece execution sometimes fell below his usual standards here but he proved a powerful force wide on the right. Times have certainly changed since the spring of 2009 when a cataclysmic row between Barton and Shearer seemed set to preface the former's exit from Tyneside. Pardew claims he has a \"strong connection\" with Barton but acknowledges their relationship must be lived on a day-to-day basis. Much the same could be said of his coping strategy for dealing with the \"Ireland question\". Three months after arriving on loan from Aston Villa, and following assorted injuries and a bizarre interview with a French football magazine in which he dissed Cork and Birmingham while suggesting his natural habitat was Los Angeles, Stephen Ireland finally made his debut as a 69th-minute substitute. He made it to some effect. With his first touch Ireland combined with Ameobi before volleying tantalisingly wide on the turn, showing a technical flair which has sometimes been absent from Pardew's side. Few on Tyneside have missed Michael Owen and, entirely predictably, the former \u00a3120,000-a-week Newcastle striker was serenaded with \"only one greedy bastard\" when he came on for Manchester United. Pardew looked nervous \u2013 unnecessarily so. Tiot\u00e9, Coloccini and Ireland were among those who secured a deserved draw. It may be some time until they turn the clock back to the mid-1990s and start challenging the other United for the title again but Newcastle and their manager should not be underestimated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
