To do this we need a clear, far-sighted and strong political will, set on pursuing a new course that aims at refocusing financial and economic investments toward those areas that truly safeguard the conditions of a life worthy of humanity on a healthy planet for today and tomorrow.\u201d He put particular emphasis on the role of young people, who \u201cshow a heightened sensitivity to the complex problems that arise from this emergency. We must not place the burden on the next generations to take on the problems caused by the previous ones.\u201d As a small state, the Vatican has observer status at the talks, so the pope is able to send a representative but has no voting rights on key decisions. As an Argentinian, Pope Francis\u2019s words carried particular resonance as this is still regarded as a Latin American COP, despite the last-minute change of venue from Chile to Madrid following political unrest in Santiago. The Chilean government is still the official host, and its environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, is the official Chilean president, in charge of the conference, appearing frequently flanked by Lorena Aguilar of the co-hosts Costa Rica, and the UN\u2019s top climate official, Patricia Espinosa, of Mexico. Kat Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, welcomed the message from the Holy See: \u201cThe pope\u2019s intervention in 2015, Laudato si\u2019, helped to secure the Paris agreement, and pushed the cause of global cooperation. It\u2019s a sad reflection on the lack of progress since then that he feels the need to once again make the moral case for action. \u201cThe studies published this week showing temperatures and emissions hitting new highs suggests our leaders are failing us. It\u2019s no wonder that Pope Francis has felt the need to step in once again to remind politicians they need to do a much better job.\u201d Neil Thorns, the director of advocacy at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: \u201cPope Francis is clear you can\u2019t tackle the climate crisis on its own: it has to be considered alongside wider issues of environmental degradation, poverty and inequality. \u201cHis message to COP25 highlights the need to reform our model of development alongside refocusing our economic systems, emphasising the \u2018challenge of civilisation\u2019 is for us to act for the common good and with the most vulnerable people at the heart of decisions.\u201d Various faith groups prayed for action on the climate on Tuesday at the COP, and on Friday morning will bring a giant clock to the venue to \u201csound the alarm\u201d on the climate crisis. Thursday was designated as youth day, with a series of events held to highlight generational differences. Climate strike activists were planning a march through the centre of Madrid on Friday evening, coordinated with marches in other cities around the world. Progress has been slow on the official agenda at the two weeks of UN talks, which began on Monday. Efforts are focusing on a provision of the Paris agreement that would allow for an international trade in carbon, which is controversial among some activists but supported by others. Behind the scenes, countries are wrangling over how to update their plans to cut or curb greenhouse gas emissions, set out under the 2015 Paris agreement. A growing number of countries, including the UK, which will host next year\u2019s meeting, are signing up to a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but governments are under pressure to set stronger targets for 2030."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
