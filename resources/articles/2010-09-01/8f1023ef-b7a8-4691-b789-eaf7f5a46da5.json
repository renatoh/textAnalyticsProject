Lennon's imaginings and McCartney's yesterdays are surely worth believing in. The fact that Tony Blair goes on claiming to believe in his only further reveals what a wilfully Labour-party-and-human-race-betraying spin-merchant he continues to be. Michael Horovitz New Departures/Poetry Olympics, London \u2022\u2008I am surprised that Tony Blair capitulated to a few hundred protesters (Blair cancels book party at Tate amid fears of protests, 9 September) when as prime minister, he ignored over a million. Sheila Woods Dunstable, Bedfordshire \u2022\u2008We shouldn't lose sleep over a dropped \"da da\" from Bonanza (Letters, 8 September), but focus instead on the absence of Dada in our modern world. This creative movement was founded in 1915 to highlight the horrors and pointlessness of the first world war. Sadly, the movement lost its way during the 1920s. Would \"A Journey\" have chosen a different path, and how many thousands of lives would have been saved, had Dada still been alive in 2003? Peter McKinney Brentwood, Essex \u2022\u2008I agree with Harriet Connides (Letters, 7 September), and have signed the petition, but surely the real point is that those of us who want a more civilised world must be petitioning to stop the execution of anyone regardless of their IQ. John Kemp Cheltenham \u2022\u2008Further to Marilyn Davies's letter (9 September), I want to wish my father-in-law, Roy Clark, a good nominative deterministic outcome in the Feltwell ward of the QE hospital in Kings Lynn. Nic Groombridge Potters Bar, Hertfordshire \u2022\u2008Following Patrick Barkham's article (Cambridge and me, G2, 9 September), can I pitch a piece entitled \"The Polytechnic of North London (Essex Road branch) and Me \u2013 how it changed my life\"?
