Arnis Zalkalns, a builder from Latvia, killed 14-year-old Alice last August before weighing down her body on a river bed in west London. Zalkalns then took his own life. He had been allowed into Britain in 2007 despite a previous conviction in Latvia for murdering his wife and concealing her body. Alice\u2019s family will ask a coroner on Monday to set up a wider inquiry into whether British authorities ever knew about Zalkalns\u2019s homicidal past. A pre-inquest hearing is due at West London coroner\u2019s court, where the scope of the inquiry into the death of the gifted teenager may be decided. Alice\u2019s family want an investigation into whether British authorities breached their obligations under the European convention on human rights and whether European Union countries shared information on highly dangerous offenders. Article 2 of the ECHR protects the right to life. In 2009, Zalkalns was arrested by the Metropolitan police over an alleged indecent assault of a 14-year-old girl in west London. It is not known whether British police knew of his murder conviction during that investigation. That case was dropped, police say, after the girl declined to make a statement. In a statement, Alice\u2019s family said: \u201cLosing Alice has left a hole in our lives that can never be filled. But our questions about why the authorities knew nothing about her murderer, despite his previous conviction and arrest, can and should be answered. We hope the coroner will agree.\u201d Coroner Chinyere Inyama will make the decision. If he rejects the family\u2019s plea then the inquest would be a relatively narrow one. Coroners have the power to turn their inquest into a wider inquiry and to make recommendations to prevent further deaths. The Gross family are being supported by the civil rights group Liberty. Emma Norton, a solicitor for Liberty, said: \u201cThis government wants to monitor all emails or mobile phones, but does not want to know if someone has a murder conviction. A murder conviction is something the authorities ought to know about. \u201cThe state has a positive obligation to protect people from a known risk, in this case someone who was a violent offender.\u201d Norton added: \u201cWhat happened to Alice appears to have come about, in part, because the authorities knew nothing about this man. Alice\u2019s family want to know why this was the case. Did an information-sharing system break down? Does it even exist? Whatever the answer, they want to do something about it.\u201d Alice\u2019s family say they do not want their daughter\u2019s death exploited by anti-immigration groups: \u201cWe believe in freedom of movement and human rights, as did Alice, and we repeat our request that her death not be appropriated by those with an anti-immigration agenda. \u201cWe live in a multicultural and multifaith area, and our community has been extraordinary in its unity, sympathy, compassion and support for our family since our daughter was taken from us in this brutal and senseless way.\u201d Zalkalns avoided facing justice for Alice\u2019s death by killing himself and his body was found by police days after they had recovered the girl\u2019s body following a wide-ranging search lasting weeks. Scotland Yard has said there was enough evidence to have charged Zalkalns had he lived and the probable motive for his crime was sexual. Alice was last seen on 28 August 2014 after going for a walk. Police believe Zalkalns came across Alice during her final walk along a canal towpath. One week later, Zalkalns, 41, was reported missing from his west London home. After a month of searches, Alice\u2019s body was recovered from the Brent river on 30 September, after it had been deliberately weighed down by parts of a tree trunk. On 4 October, Zalkalns\u2019s body was found hanging from a tree in dense woodland in Boston Manor park, west London. A music fund has been set up in Alice\u2019s name, Alice\u2019s Youth Music Memorial Fund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
