He was paralysed from the knees down, numb in his hands and had no sensation down one side of his face, but he knew he was lucky. \"There were people there hooked up to respirators, helpless and unable to do anything for themselves,\" he recalled. \"It never occurred to me to ask: 'Fucking hell, why is this happening to me?' I still had hope. Being a professional footballer has taught me how to fight in training and out on the pitch. Now I had to fight against this illness. I was always sure that I would come back.\" With neat symmetry Babbel will complete his psychological rehabilitation from a traumatic year in Cardiff tomorrow. In the arena in which he first detected the strength-sapping symptoms of Epstein-Barr, the virus that would prompt the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome that later threatened his life, the former German international hopes to earn Liverpool a sixth trophy since he swapped Munich for Merseyside two years ago. That he will be involved for the Community Shield at all is remarkable. The 29-year-old's last competitive match came at Bolton Wanderers last August, back on the evening when Sander Westerveld was all butter fingers in the visitors' goal and, thanks to a last-minute winner from Dean Holdsworth, the Trotters won 2-1 to go top of the league. He was withdrawn, drained and exhausted, at the interval. \"I couldn't run, I couldn't even breathe,\" he said. \"I just told the boss: 'I really don't know what's wrong with me, but this is unbearable.' \"I'd noticed it before. After the Charity Shield [against Manchester United] I'd felt unusually tired but I thought it was something to do with the roof being closed and the air not being too good in the Millennium Stadium. But after the Super Cup against Bayern Munich in Monaco I felt dead. You can see in the pictures - all the other players were celebrating but I looked really tired. G\u00e9rard Houllier sent me to Germany to have a check-up and blood tests, and that's when I found I had the Epstein-Barr virus [the virus which causes glandular fever]. \"Even so, after two or three months recuperating I was back in training at Melwood but then I lost the feeling in my toes, feet and, eventually, my lower legs. Every day was worse, so I consulted the specialist in Germany and within 30 seconds he'd confirmed that I had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. They reserved a room for me in intensive care just in case I ever had problems breathing. If my respiratory muscles had stopped working and I had not had a respirator available, I could have died.\" Guillain-Barr\u00e9 is an inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves and can attack the muscles in the limbs, chest, face and eyes. It affects fewer than two people per 100,000 every year, of which around 85% make a complete or nearly complete recovery. Babbel may be back playing again but 10% of sufferers are unable to walk alone a year after developing the syndrome, while another 10% die. In Munich the full-back capped 51 times by his country was given injections for five days to alleviate the paralysis that was slowly spreading up his arms and legs. His mother described him as looking \"like an 80-year-old\". He spent much of December confined to a wheelchair, struggling to speak with one side of his face numb, and lost two stones as his muscles withered away. Eventually, as his body began to fight back against the disease, he could stumble the 10 metres from his bed to the toilet. That progress was maintained in a clinic for neurological illnesses in the Bavarian spa town of Bad Aibling, then at a rehab centre run by the German national team physio Klaus Eder. For the Liverpool assistant manager Phil Thompson and his coach Sammy Lee, the sight of the man whose barnstorming runs and fearsome tackling along the right flank had inspired the Merseysiders' cup treble in 2001 restricted to a wheelchair was hard to accept. Former team-mates from Bayern Munich also visited his bedside - Paulo Sergio came with a vicar and spent the afternoon in prayer with the patient. \"I'd have to ask them to leave because I was so tired,\" said the German. \"It took it out of me. The sight of me looking so frail was probably more shocking for them than it was for me. Phil and Sammy remembered me as a player but I'd been getting worse for ages. It had been a steady deterioration. \"It was just great to know they hadn't forgotten me. Liverpool went out of their way for me and I was even offered a new contract. Nobody knew whether I'd come back or not but the club were behind me all the way. They never forgot me, even when I'd been away for months. My dream is to give something back but the only way I can re-pay them is to help win trophies.\" Should Babbel help to beat Arsenal tomorrow the cheer among the Scouse contingent is likely to be loudest when he raises the Shield at the end. There was a fleeting visit to Melwood before the end of last season but this summer has been spent in a German rehab clinic building up fitness towards his remarkably speedy return. His appearance in Liverpool's friendly against Lazio at Anfield had the Kop in full voice and the full-back uncharacteristically choked. \"I'd never heard of this illness before but now cases are coming out of the woodwork all the time,\" said Babbel, who has written to Oxford's 18-year-old midfielder Jamie Brooks to offer encouragement as he battles against the disease. \"A couple of months ago I met a young player here at the academy, just 14 years old, who is suffering from the same illness. He was on a respirator and in a wheelchair but the fact that I've recovered fully should inspire him. \"I appreciate life much more than I did; I've changed. To be able to run again is wonderful. I can kick a football, a great feeling; my power's coming back and I'm around 90% fit, though the last bit will only come with games. It's a case of going back to basics. My body has to learn how to cope with challenges and I have to learn to time my jumps for headers, but every game I've played has been a bit better. \"I have to pinch myself sometimes after all I've been through but it's for occasions like this at the Millennium Stadium that I fought to come back. This is a chance to win a trophy. We have the quality to win things this season but above all else we have the self-belief. This will be a special day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
