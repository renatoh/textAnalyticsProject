In his March circular the president of the Australian Council of State School Organisations, Phillip Spratt, accused Labor of an \u201cirrational and illogical policy in the scrabble for votes\u201d. The Catholic education office in Melbourne reportedly intervened in the Batman byelection with 30,000 robocalls in favour of Labor\u2019s Ged Kearney, and the federal opposition hopes the sector will continue to lobby for its policy at the 2019 election. On Monday the education minister, Simon Birmingham, inflamed the dispute with the sector, telling Sky News \u201cthere\u2019s always somebody who can be bought by a few pieces of silver\u201d, suggesting Labor had bought Catholic Education Melbourne\u2019s support. On Tuesday the Labor frontbench MP Brendan O\u2019Connor labelled the comments \u2013 apparently comparing the sector to Judas \u2013 \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and called on Birmingham to apologise. Labor first promised to restore Catholic school funding in June 2017 as part of its policy to unwind the Coalition\u2019s Gonski 2.0 funding model at a cost of $17bn over 10 years. Given 86% of the projected funding growth cut by the Coalition came from public schools in the first two years, the state system stands to benefit most from Labor\u2019s policy. But restoration of needs-based funding agreements negotiated by the previous Labor governments will include the system-weighted average, a higher of funding per student as a result of averaging family incomes across the Catholic system and some independent systems. Spratt said Bill Shorten\u2019s promise to the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference chairman, Denis Hart, would \u201carbitrarily\u201d give their schools an extra $250m in the first two years of government, with billions more to come over the next decade. He said Labor should wait until the National School Resourcing Board reviewed socioeconomic status loadings before committing to \u201cspecial deals\u201d. Spratt compared the promise to George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, saying it amounted to a secret rewriting of rules by some that \u201csee themselves as being more equal than others\u201d. \u201cThe audacity of this partisan move by the leader of the opposition has astonished many parents, families and staff teams of public schools, as it appears that a small number of Catholic bishops now hold sway over national party politics and policy,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the sake of our public schools, its students, staff and families that support them, I hope this Orwellian dystopia remains a work of fiction \u2013 there has to be truly needs-based funding in our proud nation with no special deals for entitled want or political opportunism.\u201d The ACSSO is the federal body of parents and citizens associations and says it speaks for the families of 2.5 million children enrolled in public schools. Under the Gonski 2.0 schools funding model, the federal government will provide all government schools with 20% of the school resourcing standard by 2027, while non-government schools will get 80%. In its final form it amounted to a $23.5bn increase in funding over 10 years compared with the 2014 budget, including $6.7bn more for Catholic schools, but a cut compared with Gillard government funding agreements. A spokesman for Shorten said all schools would be better off under Labor because it would \u201creturn every dollar that Turnbull has cut\u201d, including for Catholic and government schools. \u201cUnder Labor, the neediest schools will get the biggest funding increases, in the shortest time,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the neediest schools are public schools, so they will get by far the most funding.\u201d On Monday the former prime minister Tony Abbott maintained the rage against his own party\u2019s school funding policy by claiming that Catholic schools would \u201csuffer a big loss in funding\u201d. \u201cIf the government was smart, we would have a look at our existing policy,\u201d he told 2GB radio. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make low-fee schools in middle class suburbs almost impossible to run.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
