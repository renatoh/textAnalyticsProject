Curran, 21, was added to the party as injury cover for Jake Ball after the Nottinghamshire man suffered a knee injury during Monday\u2019s nervy eight-wicket win over a West Indies Board XI in St Kitts \u2013 their final warm-up before the three-match one-day series begins in Antigua on Friday. Ball complained of pain in the back of his right knee during his third over and played no further part in the match \u2013 he was due for a scan \u2013 with England then turning to the elder of Surrey\u2019s two Curran brothers for what is his first senior call-up. \u201cI woke up about half past four and saw I had a message from [national selector] James Whitaker on my phone,\u201d said Curran, who pressed his case with 10 wickets in the drawn two-match first-class series against Sri Lanka A at which the selector Angus Fraser was present. \u201cI thought I\u2019d give it a quick read and he\u2019d be saying well done on the series \u2013 and I wasn\u2019t thinking very clearly at that time in the morning. But then I saw the words \u2018West Indies\u2019 and I was awake then to say the least. It\u2019s all pretty surreal right now. I\u2019m giddy, I can\u2019t wait to get out there.\u201d Curran, who shot to prominence in 2015 as his 76 wicket powered Surrey into Division One, leapfrogs his teenage brother and fellow Lion, Sam, in terms of the pecking order, with the all-rounder coming close to selection when David Willey, pulled out of the Caribbean tour last month due with a shoulder injury. Nevertheless, the older Curran\u2019s news was well received. \u201cI waited until 7am and Sam wasn\u2019t very pleased to be woken up \u2013 it\u2019s our first day off,\u201d added Curran. \u201cBut he understood when I told him, and he was as excited as me.\u201d Curran is not the only new arrival on England\u2019s short tour, with Alex Hales joining but not officially added to the squad as he continues his recovery from a broken hand suffered in India at the start of the year. Paul Farbrace, who is leading the group while the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, has time off, revealed the opener was unlikely to be fit for the first two fixtures in Antigua but could return when the series wraps up in Barbados next week. Farbrace said: \u201cBasically he\u2019s coming to continue his rehab with hard balls and sun on his back. He\u2019s been hitting tennis balls and soft balls with a cast on so he\u2019ll join us tomorrow but he is not officially in the squad. I would think he will have to work a lot to prove he is 100% fit. There\u2019s no point in rushing him.\u201d In his absence Jonny Bairstow could be given the opener\u2019s spot after top-scoring from there on Monday with 86, with Jason Roy\u2019s bruised right hand not risked. Roy is expected to return, however, meaning Sam Billings, who has played in place of Hales since his injury but made just one score above 30 in six white-ball innings, could be the one to miss out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
