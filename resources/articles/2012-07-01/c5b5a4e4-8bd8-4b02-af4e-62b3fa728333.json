Enforcement notices were served on Tuesday on the travellers, some of whom had previously lived on Dale Farm. Following last year's mass eviction, many travellers moved to a neighbouring lawful site on Oak Lane, with some settling on the road approaching the site. Last year's clearance, following a decade-long row over unauthorised plots on the six-acre site, cost Basildon council millions of pounds in operational and legal costs. The council said it had served notices on 19 caravans unlawfully parked on a track leading to the former Dale Farm site and added that the numbers of occupants at Oak Lane had exceeded its lawful capacity. The Traveller Solidarity Network (TSN) said families had been unable to move from Dale Farm \"due to a lack of plots in the area\" since last year's forced eviction. \"They have lived in cramped conditions without running water, regular electricity as well as sewage problems.\" Mary Sheridan, a mother living on Oak Lane, said: \"The council and the government still will not listen; we have nowhere else to go. Why would we be living with no running water and sewage if we had somewhere else to go? We want a safe place to live where our kids can go to school. Is that too much ask?\" Travellers have been given until 29 August to appeal against the eviction notices. Council leader Tony Ball said: \"People know that Basildon council is committed to upholding the law and will go through the relevant processes to ensure compliance with the law. \"In February, we served planning contravention notices giving 21 days to respond to the notices and leave the area. Clearly this has not happened and the council has been carefully considering the correct options and action available. We have had to be certain that we are taking the right options in regards to this particular breach. \"I still find it immensely frustrating that having cleared the [unlawful] site last year, what appears to be a small minority of the original residents are persisting with this dangerous and disruptive behaviour. It is also apparent to us that many of those who are there [unlawfully] are new to the area and have nothing to do with the original [unlawful] settlement.\" Jo McGuire, a Dale Farm supporter and TSN member, said: \"The message this time last year is still the same today: these families have nowhere else to go because the council have failed to authorise any pitches in the area. \"The council is choosing to evict before new planning applications have been considered. These families are trying to do everything they can to keep their kids in the local school, but it seems the council just wants to clear them from the area.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
