It\u2019s been a marvellous day for Australia and a chastening one for England. I\u2019ll leave you with our match report from Lord\u2019s. Thanks for your company and emails; I\u2019m off to live in the woods for a couple of years. Bye! The thoroughly impressive Aaron Finch speaks again \u201cThat\u2019s the first part ticked off, reaching the semi-finals. We\u2019ve played some good cricket so far. England are a stand-out side who can take you apart, so it was nice that we found ways to keep getting wickets in the middle of the innings. Jason Behrendorff bowled beautifully; every time he was called upon he picked up wickets. Nathan Lyon didn\u2019t get the rewards but he was brilliant. \u201cDavey is playing nicely. People say it\u2019s not the Warner of old but there have been some wickets in this tournament that have demanded a bit more respect, and we\u2019ve tried to sum up the conditions as quickly as we can every time. He was really close to his best today.\u201d Eoin Morgan speaks \u201cWe were outplayed. I thought we bowled really well up front and they played and missed a lot. They had a fantastic partnership up front and posted a good total. We felt the wicket got a little bit better, although it was still challenging. Losing early wickets isn\u2019t ideal and pegged us back quite substantially. \u201cGiven the circumstances, it\u2019s not hugely disappointing to lose. Our fate is in our own hands with the next two games we play. Everything we need to turn around is quite simple \u2013 we\u2019re not going to search for something that isn\u2019t there. The basics have let us down in the last two games.\u201d Read it and weep uncontrollably (if you\u2019re an England fan) The Man of the Match is the irritatingly likeable Aaron Finch \u201cI didn\u2019t play too badly. Any time you contribute to a win, it\u2019s nice. We got through that new-ball spell and set a reasonable foundation. It was nipping around, so we tried to rein it in and be as tight as we could be, and then just cash in on any width.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been checking the OBO in between meeting the members of Kiss (who don\u2019t have any opinions about the cricket, incredibly),\u201d says Michael Hann. \u201cGreat that the England cricket team have noted the men\u2019s football team\u2019s transformation into loveable overachievers and decided to occupy their old role as the Golden Generation Who Can\u2019t Justify The Pre-Tournament Hype. English sport needs that team, and I for one am proud the cricketers have stepped up. I\u2019m hoping for six autobiographies the minute the World Cup ends.\u201d Presumably with Alex Hales in the Joey Barton role. The game was won and lost with the new balls. Australia bowled and batted with intelligence and focus; England, not so much. Read all about it. I double dare you Australia move into the semi-finals with two games to spare. England move into the last-chance saloon. Starc gets his fourth wicket, with Rashid driving to extra cover, to complete a thumping victory for Australia. That\u2019s their best performance of the tournament, one that brooks not a solitary argument from anyone connected with England. Three of their Big Five stood up again \u2013 Finch, Warner and Starc \u2013 while the surprise selection Jason Behrendorff had the game of his life. WICKET! England 221 all out (Rashid c Stoinis b Starc 25) 44th over: England 213-9 (Rashid 17, Wood 1) Jason Behrendorff finishes with figures of 10-0-44-5, and memories that will keep him warm in his dotage. His boyish smile is lovely to see. \u201cRob,\u201d says Brian Withington (42nd over). \u201cShall I take that as a no, then?\u201d If you want to twist my words, there\u2019s not much I can do... It\u2019s Jason Behrendorff who gets the five-for! Archer drives flat and hard towards long-off, where Warner takes a good running catch. When Channel 5 run 50 Most Inspired Selection on a Saturday night, Behrendorff will be part of the discussion. 43rd over: England 210-8 (Rashid 16, Archer 1) Starc goes around the wicket, hunting the two wickets that would give him another five-for. He deserves one, for he has been immense today \u2013 he\u2019s taken three big wickets (Root, Morgan, Stokes), all with either brilliant deliveries or superb planning. \u201cBah!\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to invent a new format of the game - though that\u2019d be ridiculous wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d 42nd over: England 207-8 (Rashid 14, Archer 0) \u201cIs it time,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201cto think about protecting Net Run Rate?\u201d It\u2019s a good question. I suppose my response would bE THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING ABOUT PROTECTING THE EFFING FAST BOWLERS BY NOW, NOT NET BLOODY RUN RATE IN THE HOPE FOUR TEAMS MIGHT DO A SIMULTANEOUS DEVON LOCH AND LET US SNEAK THROUGH WITH FOUR DEFEATS! WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FARCE IS GOING ON! MOTHER CRICKET, FATHER CRICKET, WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU CAN STICK YOUR WISDEN 2019 RIGHT IN THE BLOCKHOLE, I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. WHERE WERE YOU AT 3AM ON 28 JANUARY 2018 WHEN ENGLAND WERE PLAYING ANOTHER ODI, EH? I WAS BLOODY OBOING, AND IT WAS THE MORNING AFTER MY BIRTHDAY AS WELL. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMATOSE! IT WAS ALL PART OF THE \u201cJOURNEY\u201d, YOU SAID, YOU\u2019LL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK ON IT FONDLY AFTER THE WORLD CUP, WHEN THE \u201cJOURNEY\u201d IS COMPLETE. YEAH, THE JOURNEY FROM THE GUTTER TO THE STARS AND BACK AGAIN! THANKS A BUNCH! Great fielding from Glenn Maxwell. Woakes slog swept Behrendorff to cow corner, where Maxwell took the catch and got rid of the ball before his momentum took him over the ropes. Finch was there to complete the relay catch. 41st over: England 200-7 (Woakes 25, Rashid 9) Rashid cuffs Lyon down the ground for six. A gold star for him. 40th over: England 191-7 (Woakes 23, Rashid 1) Moeen Ali has gone, caught behind off a good-length delivery from the new bowler Behrendorff. That\u2019s his third wicket. 39th over: England 184-6 (Woakes 21, Ali 2) Starc is getting a bit of inswing to the left-handers, which makes him even deadlier. When you consider the context, that ball to Stokes might be the best of the tournament so far. He concedes only one run from the seventh over, and not even an advert for the Hounslow branch of Pepe\u2019s Chick\u2019n\u2019Rice between overs can cheer me up. Kumar knew. 38th over: England 183-6 (Woakes 20, Ali 2) So, Australia have qualified for the semi-finals with two matches to spare. England need to win their last two games, away to India and against New Zealand in Durham, to ensure they go through to the semi-final. They might get there with one victory, but they would need a few favours from elsewhere - starting with a New Zealand win over Pakistan tomorrow. 37th over: England 177-6 (Woakes 18, Ali 0) Stokes kicked his bat in frustration when he heard the ball clip the stumps. He played a glorious innings, but Starc was too good. Sensational bowling from Mitchell Starc! Absolutely perfect! He has ended Ben Stokes\u2019 heroic innings with an unplayable inswinging yorker. That wicket, in the first over of a new spell, was delivered as if to order. It was a phenomenal piece of bowling. 36th over: England 173-5 (Stokes 88, Woakes 15) England are targeting Cummins, simply because there is pace on the ball. Stokes charges his first ball, flat-batting it through cover point for four, and smashes the third through extra cover for another boundary. It was in the air but wide of the diving Lyon. Woakes completes an excellent over by dumping a pull through midwicket for four more. Here\u2019s Simon McMahon, whose email has the subject: \u2018Straws\u2019. \u201cIf England scrape though after beating New Zealand, possibly via NRR, they will be so delighted/relieved that they will probably relax, get their mojo back and go and win the whole goddam thing. It\u2019s coming home, Rob.\u201d 35th over: England 160-5 (Stokes 79, Woakes 11) Four singles from Lyon\u2019s over. It looks pretty difficult for the batsmen to put pace on the old ball. \u201cThat Notts match, and particularly that last ball, is my happiest cricketing memory,\u201d says Louise Wright. \u201cThanks for the link. As I recall it, the fielder\u2019s hat fell off as he went in desperate pursuit of the ball. Please don\u2019t correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the version in my head is so much more aesthetically pleasing than reality. Or at least as much as anything involving Eddie Hemmings &amp; Bruce French as they were in 1989 could be aesthetically pleasing.\u201d Bruce French is about four times sexier now than he was in 1989. You can\u2019t say that of many men, but we do our best to cope. 34th over: England 156-5 (Stokes 77, Woakes 9) Cummins, on for Stoinis, is flicked crisply for four by the hitherto strokeless Woakes. The extra pace is good for England, for now at least; Stokes drags a pull for four to make it nine from the over. Whatever happens \u2013 and I think we all know how this ends \u2013 it has been an exceptional innings from Stokes. \u201cThanks for the OBO commentary,\u201d says Milind Pania. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to kill time at work in Berlin. The Germans don\u2019t even know there is a World Cup on since cricket isn\u2019t available on free-to-air TV. As an Indian who has been painfully disappointed by the antics of the BCCI and Indian TV channels, I have cheered on the Black Caps for over 4 years now, England could take a leaf out of their book as to how to chase down a total in difficult conditions. Or at least out of Kane Williamson\u2019s book. Stokes apart, this is painful to watch (read?).\u201d I can confirm the experience of pain. 33rd over: England 147-5 (Stokes 73, Woakes 4) Lyon replaces Maxwell, and Stokes limps his way through a single to mid-on. It might be cramp, apparently. That run is one of only two from the over, and the required rate goes up to 8.17 as a result. \u201cI wonder,\u201d says Steven Salter, \u201chow Alex Hales feels watching this.\u201d 32nd over: England 145-5 (Stokes 72, Woakes 3) Another very useful over from Stoinis, with just four singles from it. England need 141 from 18 overs. It\u2019s a no from me. \u201cEngland have been exulted as the favourites going into this WC and chief of chiefs Jos B as their talisman of big hitting uber batsmen,\u201d says Pete. \u201cHas he even got past 30 this World Cup yet for England?\u201d No. The umpires have called for a drink Here\u2019s something to read with your schooner of neat brandy. 31st over: England 141-5 (Stokes 70, Woakes 1) Stokes has had enough. He belts Maxwell for two sixes in three balls. The first was almost a freebie, from a rank long hop; the second was a flat slog sweep that bisected the two fielders on the boundary. Stokes has played jolly well. \u201cIt seems chasing is very much not the way to go at this World Cup,\u201d says Thomas Whiteley. \u201cEngland failed against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and look likely to fail now, after being considered chasers par excellence before\u2026what gives? It seems India are smarter in that regard, maybe?\u201d Virat knows. 30th over: England 129-5 (Stokes 58, Woakes 1) Steve Smith misses another run-out chance, this time from midwicket with Woakes well short of his ground. On this slow pitch, England have struggled to punish Australia\u2019s fifth bowler - between them, Stoinis and Maxwell have figures of 7-0-28-1. 29th over: England 128-5 (Stokes 57, Woakes 1) Glenn Maxwell replaces Nathan Lyon, who is being saved for Moeen Ali, and gets through a cheap over - three from it. England need 158 from 126 balls. They are running out of overs, wickets and hope. But apart from that... \u201cWhy didn\u2019t England prepare pitches like this for the Pakistan series in May?\u201d says Alex Teakle. \u201cIf Kohli knew what the pitches would be like, why not England?\u201d You know, that\u2019s an exceedingly good point. I think they thought they had cracked it. That said, I still think their defeats in this World Cup have had more to do with pressure - and decades of rubble in the collective subconscious - than pitches. 28th over: England 125-5 (Stokes 55, Woakes 0) On the plus side, if England win the next four games they\u2019ll win the World Cup! Chris Woakes comes in ahead of Moeen Ali, who has been Nathan Lyon\u2019s bunny. Buttler flicked Stoinis wristily behind square, and for a split-second it looked like the ball was going for six. He didn\u2019t get enough on it, however, and Khawaja ran round the boundary to take a beautiful two-handed catch. Buttler goes for 25 from 27 balls; England are going to lose this game. What a brilliant catch from Usman Khawaja! 27th over: England 122-4 (Stokes 53, Buttler 25) Buttler makes room to slash Lyon behind square for a couple, with the indefatigable Cummins sprawling to save the boundary. Five from the over. \u201cHi there Rob,\u201d says Sandile Xaso. \u201cAustralia imposing themselves on every opponent without ever really clicking is extremely worrying. But really, it\u2019s difficult to root against a team that has a high-class performer like Pat Cummins. He gives batsmen nothing, bowling a tight, testing line at +145 km/h AND bounce. He tries as hard with the first delivery of a practice match as he will on day five of a dead Test having bowled 21 overs in the baking sun. Outstanding cricketer.\u201d Yes, he\u2019s the definition of a champion, and such an admirable character. It\u2019s also easy to forget the years of misery he went through. Stokes has his calf massaged between overs, and takes the opportunity to wolf down a banana. 26th over: England 117-4 (Stokes 51, Buttler 22) Stokes whips Stoinis for a single to reach an admirable half-century: 75 balls, five fours, umpteen grimaces. He is really struggling with his leg, possibly his calf. Buttler, meanwhile, ends a frustrating spell of mistimed strokes with a savage thump through mid-on for four. 25th over: England 109-4 (Stokes 49, Buttler 16) Stokes chips Lyon down the ground for four. Finch ran in from mid-on, at first thinking there might be the opportunity of a catch, but it bounced short and then ran away from him to the boundary. Lyon replies impressively with five dot balls, including a fine delivery that beats Stokes\u2019s attempted cut. England need 177 from the second half of their innings to win. 24th over: England 105-4 (Stokes 45, Buttler 16) Stokes flicks Stoinis for a single to bring up a level-headed fifty partnership from 58 balls. England have actually played pretty well since that desperate start, but Stokes and Buttler have been left with so much to do. The pitch looks slow and awkward; Buttler in particular has mistimed a number of strokes. \u201cIn Full Match Awareness, Father Time suddenly comes to life and taps departing batsmen on the shoulder, after which they are seen no more,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cWhat will happen at the end to the Not Out player?\u201d He is revealed as Keyser Soze? 23rd over: England 102-4 (Stokes 43, Buttler 16) Lyon replaces Cummins (5-1-14-0) and is swept very hard for four by Stokes. He is playing beautifully, but he he grimaced as he came up from that sweep. He seems to have pulled something in his leg. Great, nice one. \u201cBilateral track bullies,\u201d says Ian Copestake, through the tears. 22nd over: England 97-4 (Stokes 38, Buttler 16) Another reprieve for Buttler, who is short of his ground when Smith\u2019s underarm throw just misses the stumps. England are living so dangerously. \u201cHere\u2019s an angle for you to ponder,\u201d says William Matthewman. \u201cI vividly remember watching Bob Willis extoling the virtues of Jos Butler as a World Cup opener on Sky Sports a few weeks ago and was convinced he\u2019d lost his mind. However, I can now see him fitting perfectly into the role in Roy\u2019s absence. He\u2019d either have gone cheaply today (Vince-esque) or taken this game, and all the early sting, away from the Aussies quickly.\u201d Yes, if England lose today they may get funky for the India game, if Jason Roy is still unfit. But that would be perceived as panic, and it would also leave them with a porcelain middle order. Personally I would leave Buttler where he is, though I might open with Moeen. Australia appeal unsuccessfully for LBW against Jos Buttler, and then waste their review. It was a poor review because Buttler was a long way down the pitch. Replays showed the ball hit him outside the line, which means Australia lose their review. 21st over: England 93-4 (Stokes 36, Buttler 15) A quiet over from Cummins; two from it. The required rate (6.65) isn\u2019t yet an issue for England. \u201cBilateral series is the new metatarsal,\u201d says Daniel Harris. \u201cAnyone got Uri Geller\u2019s digits?\u201d What\u2019s Jason Roy\u2019s hamstring, then? Bryan Robson\u2019s shoulder? 20th over: England 91-4 (Stokes 35, Buttler 14) Marcus Stoinis comes into the attack in place of Starc. Stokes again runs down the track, this time to blast a fine boundary over mid-on. If England can bully Australia\u2019s fifth bowler, and hit their 10 overs for around 200, they will still have a chance. \u201c\u201cThis,\u201d says Sumit Rahman, \u201cseems an ideal situation for Moeen Ali to come in and play one of those gritty, carefully paced innings we know he loves to make, using full match awareness.\u201d Full Match Awareness is a great name for a film. A cricket-themed horror movie, probably. 19th over: England 83-4 (Stokes 30, Buttler 11) Pat Cummins replaces Nathan Lyon. Stokes, on the charge, plays a spectacular swivel pull that races through midwicket for four. This observation will doubtless end in tears, but so far Stokes has played with admirable intelligence and determination. \u201cI wonder how Jos will cope with this uniquely 2007 situation of being 70-odd for four chasing 285. They\u2019ve had advice from power hitters, fitness gurus, nutritionists, yoga experts, but the man in this situation the most was Jamie \u2018Boom Boom\u2019 Dalrymple. I wonder if he was consulted?\u201d Never mind consulting him. Ask him if he fancies opening the batting on Sunday for my local team, England. 18th over: England 79-4 (Stokes 26, Buttler 11) Stokes is batting with a lot of commonsense, dealing almost exclusively in low-risk ones and twos. I\u2019m sure he will want to hang around and take the game as deep as possible. \u201c\u2018Flat Track Bullies\u2019 is an ugly clich\u00e9 and an ugly description,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cBut it might be the right one\u201d They had improved, at least to my eyes, on awkward pitches. But I suppose that was in bilateral series. 17th over: England 72-4 (Stokes 20, Buttler 10) Buttler is beaten by a big-spinning delivery from Lyon that bounces through the gate and over middle stump. \u201cThis,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan, \u201cprobably sums things up as well as anything.\u201d Usually it\u2019s the perfect summary of English cricket, but I\u2019m not sure on this occasion. I was enjoying the hope; I was coping with it quite nicely. 16th over: England 65-4 (Stokes 14, Buttler 10) Starc replaces Behrendorff, presumably with the remit to get Buttler before he gets in. Buttler drives sweetly for four and then edges a looser drive in the air through gully. \u201c\u2018If they fail to reach the semis, it would easily be England\u2019s worst World Cup campaign and arguably the worst for any country,\u2019\u201d says Richard Mansell, quoting an earlier entry. \u201cAhem. South Africa, 2019.\u201d Each to their own, and I\u2019m probably being a bit one-eyed, but I think it would be an unprecedented humiliation. 15th over: England 57-4 (Stokes 13, Buttler 3) I thought it was a huge toss to win this morning. It wasn\u2019t; it was a great toss to lose. But that shouldn\u2019t disguise the fact Australia have so far outplayed England to an alarming degree. \u201cI\u2019m over this World Cup already,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI wanted some r&amp;r through the group stages but I\u2019m instead through my Kalms prescription. I for one think The Hundred is going to be good! It\u2019ll be the gateway drug for Test cricket, mark my words!\u201d Out of interest, how many Kalms have you taken in the last four hours? Because those last two sentences remind me of Anthony Joshua\u2019s interview after he\u2019d been pounded about the head. 14th over: England 54-4 (Stokes 12, Buttler 1) \u201cAustralia are bowling a lot of no balls,\u201d says Josh Brooks, \u201cbut the umpires are not picking it up.\u201d Really? Are you basing that on TV pictures or are you at the ground? Have our brave bilateral boys been robbed? For the love of Vince Wells. England have lost another wicket. Bairstow swats a short ball from Behrendorff high towards deep midwicket, where Cummins takes his second excellent running catch. That was not the most judicious piece of batting. 13th over: England 52-3 (Bairstow 27, Stokes 11) Nathan Lyon, who is making his World Cup debut, comes on to replace Behrendorff (6-0-26-1). I think he\u2019s a really clever inclusion, such is his record and relish for playing against England. Stokes, surprised by the same nasty bounce that did for Warner, cuts the ball in the air through the vacant point region. Then he plays a reverse sweep that is stopped by Smith at slip. Five from the over; three singles and a two. \u201cI confess to finding a certain comfort in today\u2019s performance,\u201d says Alex Adams. \u201cA poor England batting display, to me, is as much of a childhood memory as a 99 flake by the beach, or sitting in bank holiday traffic somewhere just outside Truro. A modern, competent England has never sat well with me.\u201d Yes, but you have to embrace adulthood eventually. For heaven\u2019s sake, I haven\u2019t even used a dummy since 2016. 12th over: England 47-3 (Bairstow 26, Stokes 7) Stokes is beaten, trying to cut a ball from Cummins that was a bit too close for the shot. Four from the over. This pair are doing okay, but there\u2019s a long way to go: 239 in 38 overs, to be precise. \u201cCan we just agree,\u201d says Zaf Ayub, \u201cthat England will never win a meaningful global tournament in any sport (discounting the under-age footy ones)? Then we can get on with a life that is dreadful enough without unrealistic hopes.\u201d That\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve heard all tournament. 11th over: England 43-3 (Bairstow 25, Stokes 4) Behrendorff continues, which makes sense while the ball is swinging occasionally. For the second time in many overs he gets one to burst from a length at Stokes, which suggests a bit of uneven bounce. Stokes responds by running down the pitch to drive sweetly through extra cover for four. Those are the first runs of his innings from the 12th delivery. This is very foppin tense. \u201cI wonder, how do we get suckered into this?\u201d says Sara Torvalds. \u201cEvery World Cup, it\u2019s the same thing. This time, this time, will be different. Except it\u2019s not. Either we go into the World Cup off a fine run of form (much good that does us now!) or we\u2019re the underdogs, but the end result is always the same. Disappointment. This time the disappointment just began even sooner than anyone was prepared for. And - horror of horrors! - there\u2019s a home Ashes series coming up too. Just pile on the misery, will you!\u201d Don\u2019t worry. If England cock this up, the Ashes will be cancelled indefinitely, as will all cricket. 10th over: England 39-3 (Bairstow 25, Stokes 0) Cummins jags one back into Bairstow, who flicks it authoritatively through midwicket for four. That was a lovely shot. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist,\u201d says Pete Salmon, \u201cbut this seems like one of those moments in English cricket - lose today, tumble out of the World Cup having put every egg in that basket for four years, collapse in the Ashes against a rejuvenated Australia, and end up using 42 players until its Sir Alastair Cook and Martyn Moxon opening in the fifth Test trying to avoid a whitewash. Early days I know, but that\u2019s how it feels.\u201d We\u2019ll always have The Hundred. 9th over: England 35-3 (Bairstow 21, Stokes 0) Bairstow, having missed a lusty swipe at the previous ball, forces Behrendorff nicely through extra cover for four. He has continued to attack; Stokes looks like he wants to play himself in. \u201cThere\u2019s a parallel between England\u2019s World Cup performances and Bruce Springsteen albums,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cThey come around about once every four years and since 1992 none of them have lived up to the hype.\u201d This is no time for dry humour. 8th over: England 30-3 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 0) A bit of respite for England, as Mitchell Starc is replaced by Pat Cummins, and Stokes, on the walk, is beaten by a good delivery angled across him. A maiden. Some excellent analysis from Nasser Hussain on Sky, which highlights both how well Australia have bowled and how abysmal England were with the new ball. Australia have been much fuller, essentially, and that length brought the first two wickets. \u201cThis is one of those very rare moments,\u201d says Phil Harrison, \u201cwhen I\u2019m quite glad cricket isn\u2019t on free-to-air telly.\u201d It\u2019s okay, the highlights are on at 4.15am tomorrow morning, just after a repeat of a repeat of a repeat of Naked Attraction. 7th over: England 30-3 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 0) Bairstow clumps Behrendorff just over the leaping Finch at mid-off and away for four. That was almost a hideous dismissal. \u201cI hate using this term now that Jeremy Hunt has started to use it but we\u2019re going to bottle it aren\u2019t we?\u201d says Aejaz Shaikh. \u201cWhere would this rank on the list of England\u2019s biggest WC bottlejobs? It must be at the top, because we\u2019ve actually got a decent team this time.\u201d If they fail to reach the semis, it would easily be England\u2019s worst World Cup campaign and arguably the worst for any country. I still think Australia 1992 was the most unlikely flop, but it faded into the background when they went on to win three in a row from 1999-2007. 6th over: England 26-3 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 0) Right, look. One win from the last three games might be enough for England to get through, but it would leave them seriously vulnerable to twists of fate and/or India accidentally losing their final match to Sri Lanka to ensure a theoretically easier semi-final. This is very serious. Eoin Morgan dies by the sword. He tried to pull a short ball from Starc that was on him too quickly and flew off the top edge. It sailed towards fine leg, where Cummins ran round the boundary and took a superb catch. 5th over: England 21-2 (Bairstow 7, Morgan 4) A bit of a statement from Morgan, who gets off the mark by charging down the track to hammer Behrendorff through mid-off for four. He did that, charging the fast bowlers, in the Champions Trophy as well. It looks like he\u2019s not going to die wondering. \u201cJames Vince, ODI average of 26.5 - is he really the best opening batsman understudy in England?\u201d asks Joe Hunt. \u201cSeems incredible that he gets chance after chance for England.\u201d No, he isn\u2019t, but the best understudy has been as stupid off the field as Vince has on it. I\u2019m sure Sam Billings would also have been ahead of Vince had he been fit. After that, there aren\u2019t many credible options. 4th over: England 15-2 (Bairstow 7, Morgan 0) Eoin Morgan is beaten second ball, wafting loosely outside off stump. He counter-attacked majestically in a not dissimilar situation against Australia at the Champions Trophy two years ago. But England had qualified for the semi-finals then and, though they wanted to eliminate Australia, there was nothing like the same pressure. A wicket maiden from Starc. Root has been trapped LBW by a lovely full-length inswinger from Starc. It was so plumb that he barely stopped to discuss a review with Bairstow. England have been plunged into a nightmare. And now we have a problem. 3rd over: England 15-1 (Bairstow 7, Root 8) Bairstow has started a little nervously but that\u2019s a fine shot, a clip between mid-on and midwicket for four off Behrendorff. \u201cSo two bowlers who like to swing the ball into the right hander &amp; an opening batsman who leaves a gate open wide enough for Alastair Cook to drive his combine harvester through,\u201d weeps Jonathan Taylor. \u201cI reckon England will be two down pretty soon. Like you say though Vince not being caught behind \u2013 every cloud and all that.\u201d On the plus side, if they win today it will feel hella sweet. Jeez, so much depends on the next few hours. 2nd over: England 11-1 (Bairstow 3, Root 8) Mitchell Starc will share the new ball. He felt his hamstring after taking a quick single towards the end of the Australian innings, but he seems okay and is bowling at full pace. Bairstow punches through the covers for two and edges a big drive over the cordon for a single; then Root touches a poor delivery off the pads for four. \u201cWriting from Edinburgh, I am rather reluctantly supporting Australia today,\u201d says Charles. \u201cMostly, this is to give Sri Lanka more to fight for on Friday, when I shall be in the County Durham sunshine. Do you think that the hammering that England gave to the Afgans has done them harm? There is something about winning too easily that can break the stride of a team.\u201d Well, I think they were complacent against Sri Lanka (I think we all were), but I\u2019m not sure that had much to do with how easily they beat Afghanistan. I doubt even they know, though their subconscious might. 1st over: England 4-1 (Bairstow 0, Root 4) For England, this is the real quiz. They need a big innings from Root like never before. He gets off the mark with a risky boundary, a back cut that flashes past the diving Maxwell at catchable height. \u201cREQUESTING URGENT JASON ROY UPDATE,\u201d says Matt Simmonds. On the plus side, Vince wasn\u2019t caught at slip. And it was a great delivery from Behrendorff, a classic left-arm swing bowler\u2019s dismissal. Maybe Vince should have had a look before launching into a drive; I don\u2019t know. Goodnight James Vince. He has gone second ball, bowled through the gate by a storming inswinger from Behrendoroff. Here we go. This is thrilling and terrifying in equal measure, and they haven\u2019t bowled a ball yet. The left-armer Jason Behrendorff is going to take the first over. \u201cThis almost feel like this is a harder target to chase than 350 after the last couple of tries,\u201d says James Taylor. \u201cAt least with a higher total they\u2019d have to go full on from the first ball whereas they may take this a bit easier and when the inevitable wickets start tumbling they could leave themselves short. Probably haven\u2019t expressed that very well but you get the gist.\u201d As we\u2019re in a \u201cdigital\u201d age, I\u2019ve recorded a quick vlog with my thoughts on the runchase and England\u2019s World Cup generally. (NB: clip contains adult language) You\u2019d expect the new ball to do plenty, so England will need to play some smart cricket in the first 10 overs. James Vince and Jonny Bairstow will open the batting. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Tense, nervous headache? Yeah, the same. Things have suddenly become a bit too real for England fans, whose beloved bilateral conquerors could be two defeats away from a monumental humiliation. The prospect of them failing to reach the last four is so unthinkable that I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. They could also be five matches away from immortality, so it\u2019s a bit early to panic. The next few hours will tell us plenty about their mental state. Despite an excellent comeback in the second half of the Australian innings, England have a stiff target of 286 to chase. I\u2019d make the Aussies slight favourites. If England succeed, we can breathe easily for a few days. If they fail, there will be panic on the streets of London, Birmingham, Carlisle, Humberside, and indeed everywhere else in England. This could be a pulsating runchase. Starc, Cummins, Lyon; Bairstow, Morgan, Stokes. The next 50 overs should come with a testosterone warning. That was a brilliant finish from Carey under trying circumstances. But Australia will still feel well short of where they should have been after another huge opening stand and a substantial platform. It has been a consistent issue during Australia\u2019s campaign, but the quality of their bowling has been enough to compensate for it. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll need again today: Starc and Cummins to break through early, Lyon to do the job through the middle. England bowled well, with wickets shared around between everyone but Rashid, who bowled economically and helped keep things under control. When Finch was hitting sixes off the spinners in the middle of the innings, it could have been a different story. England will be batting in about 25 minutes, so please direct your correspondence to Rob Smyth from this point on. Thanks for your company today, I\u2019ll see everyone again for the small matter of England v India on Sunday. 50th over: Australia 285-7 (Carey 38, Starc 4) Stokes to finish off for England. Starc squeezes it back to the bowler, who fields and spins to try to run out Carey at the non-striker\u2019s end, but elects to hold onto the ball. Smart play. Carey was diving back for his crease, and had Stokes missed he would certainly have given away four overthrows. Starc manages to get off strike next ball. Carey charges the third, but Stokes drops it short and Carey can\u2019t get anywhere near it. The fourth he does, getting deep in the crease and driving it over cover! Super impressive this tournament, Alex Carey. Times the ball so cleanly, and finds a way. He drags two to deep midwicket and uses every molecule of oxygen in his body to get back and keep strike, then backs away once more to cut through cover for another four! 49th over: Australia 274-7 (Carey 28, Starc 3) There\u2019s one for Carey! Top shot, after Archer starts the over with a wide. Carey expects him to try to hit that return crease, and drives the next attempt well enough to beat the cover sweeper for four. But Archer nails the yorkers thereafter, returning dots and singles. And then that\u2019s an absolutely daft delivery to finish: with third man square and nobody stationed for a catch, he bowls short outside off and Carey slashes it fine for four. 48th over: Australia 263-7 (Carey 19, Starc 2) Mitchell Starc to the middle, and gliding a short ball for a single first ball. But that\u2019s the tone for the over: Australia are collecting ones in the final moments rather than smashing boundaries. \u201cAs an England fan I\u2019m cheered up by the last hour, but Australia\u2019s attempts to accelerate suggest that England\u2019s bish-bash-bosh style might not work on this surface. That makes early wickets vital. I can\u2019t see Starc being as unlucky as Woakes and Archer were,\u201d writes Stephen Cottrell. More pessimists! Can I find someone cheerful in this country? It gets better for England. Good line from Woakes, Cummins pushes just trying to edge to third man, but gets it finer to the keeper who takes a good tumbling catch to his right. Woakes has 2 for 3, in 4 balls. Ah, sequential. 47th over: Australia 259-6 (Carey 17, Cummins 1) Much needed boundary for Australia from Carey, who steps away from Wood\u2019s line and hammers the ball through point. Cummins tries the uppercut when he gets on strike but can\u2019t make contact. The English crowd is finding more voice now than when Finch was bossing it. On another note, I really am bringing this OBO to you from within the head of a terrifying robot overlord. Bow. 46th over: Australia 253-6 (Carey 12, Cummins 0) Reward for Woakes, who bowled so well early. Then picks up a wicket in the slog overs. Smith had to go, but he was very emotional as he came off. Not at all happy with how he hit that one. Patrick Cummins is next out, very good lower-order batsman. But Australia might struggle to get 280 from here. Mate, you\u2019ve just caught the World Cup. Or something along those lines. Smith tries to go large over long-on, gets about half of it, and Archer runs in from the rope to take the catch. 45th over: Australia 248-5 (Smith 38, Carey 8) Wood again, fast again, singles again. England loving this again. Neither batsman can get a full swing at Wood. Carey hares back for a second run after driving wide of long-off, and that\u2019s the productive stroke of the over. 44th over: Australia 242-5 (Smith 36, Carey 4) That\u2019s better for Australia. Five singles from Woakes, just dropping and nudging the ball into the manifold gaps in the field. Everything in the ring is a gap, really. Then Woakes bowls too short to finish the over, and Smith clobbers him for four. \u201cSomeone on the radio just said a batsman has \u2018an average of X against pace and Y against spin\u2019\u201d emails Simon Gates. \u201cWhat does that mean? The batsman would face both pace and spin in an innings, so what does an average against one of them mean?\u201d Well, you can still count the runs scored against a certain kind of bowling, divided by the dismissals. Same theory as general averages. 43rd over: Australia 233-5 (Smith 30, Carey 1) England will be loving this. A wicket here and a wicket there, and Wood\u2019s over goes for only five. The projected score is being revised down as we speak. Where are all those English pessimists who were emailing me earlier? Reveal thyself! 42nd over: Australia 228-5 (Smith 27, Carey 0) Alex Carey in then, who has been a good dasher at the close. Mind you, Matthew Wade just hit the fastest ever List A hundred by an Australian during the Australia A tour a couple of days ago. Ridiculous stuff! Smith works a single to Bairstow at long leg. Stoinis turns and starts sprinting back for a second. Smith not only doesn\u2019t want it, he\u2019s not even thinking about it. He has his back to Stoinis, bat down, not wanting to know. Stoinis would be able to see Smith not moving, surely, but keeps running anyway. And even runs his bat in at the non-striker\u2019s end, next to his teammate, before continuing to walk straight off without looking back. Buttler clips the bails off with Stonis about 30 yards away and growing. 41st over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 22, Stoinis 7) Australia have struggled in this World Cup to turn some big starts into big finishes. Can they go big through the last ten, or can England haul them back? Stoinis gets a very crisp drive away from Wood to the cover boundary. Seven from the over. 40th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 21, Stoinis 1) Slow starter is Stoinis. Can be explosive, but can also leave his team in deficit after gobbling up a lot of deliveries. He takes his time against Rashid to begin with here, before nudging off the mark. Ten overs to come. \u201cI would have thought that the slope benefits the top spinners,\u201d writes Hugh Swanborough. \u201cBeing able to maximize zip off the pitch and get a bit of movement is a nice surprise delivery to have up your sleeve.\u201d 39th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 20, Stoinis 0) Marcus Stoinis to the middle now, to face Wood with his tail up. 94 miles an hour is the reading on one delivery, as Wood pitches full. Then back of a length to have Stoinis pulling away from the ball, startled. That\u2019s some over. Ouch. Maxwellball was short and furious today. Wood bowls short outside off, Maxwell tries to uppercut, and feathers it through to the keeper. Here comes the frustration at not watching an entertainer at work. We should have an exhibition game one day: Maxwell, 10 overs, unlimited wickets. 38th over: Australia 212-3 (Smith 19, Maxwell 12) Archer steaming in to Maxwell, and... that is absolutely creamed by Maxwell! What a shot! Length ball with pace aplenty, but Maxwell just launches through the line of it and hits it almost 100 metres over the leg side and into the crowd. Next ball? Same shot, one bounce in front of the rope for four. Tucks a single next ball. Exhilarating, against England\u2019s most dangerous bowler. 37th over: Australia 200-3 (Smith 18, Maxwell 1) This is about the first time in this World Cup that Maxwell hasn\u2019t been off the mark with a four or a six. He drives Wood nicely, but straight to mid-off, then takes a sensible single to square leg. He\u2019s got 14 overs to face today, unlike the five or so he\u2019s had in some other matches. Smith drives Wood dead straight for four, then glides fine through third man for another. Like brushing crumbs off his trousers. 200 up. \u201cThe slope at Lord\u2019s will indeed help Rashid turn his googly, if he\u2019s bowling from the pavilion end. Are there any other international grounds with a similar slope?\u201d Hampstead Cricket Club? Not at the top level, that I can think of. Birmingham is a bit of an inverted saucer, isn\u2019t it? 36th over: Australia 190-3 (Smith 9, Maxwell 0) How\u2019s that for an eventful over? Finch\u2019s hundred, and his beaming celebration, arms spread to the dressing room. Finch\u2019s fall the next ball. Archer\u2019s follow-up, a leg-side pie that Smith glances for four. Then Archer\u2019s follow-up to the follow-up, a snorter at Glenn Maxwell that leaps at his grille and is fended away in the air with a flinch. Ton and done! The very next ball, Finch hooks at Jofra Archer, and the Wizard down there at long leg gets a chance at redemption. He takes the catch off the top edge. A misfield at long leg from Woakes, and Finch gets back for his second run. That\u2019s 15 ODI tons for him, behind only Warner, Gilchrist, M. Waugh and Ponting for Australia. 35th over: Australia 183-2 (Finch 98, Smith 4) Stokes takes us up to the drinks break, with Finch knocking a single and Smith steering a couple. \u201cOmens are bad for England today,\u201d writes Dave Seare from the dark tent where he crouches over his chicken bones. \u201cAustralia have brought a truckload of good luck (along with their skill). To compound this they\u2019ve finally selected Nathan Lyon and are denying England a turn at the Zampa buffet. Crucially I\u2019ve run out of milk for brews too.\u201d What... kind of brew has milk in it? Is this a kind of stout? Magic pudding? Wombat stew? 34th over: Australia 178-2 (Finch 96, Smith 1) Archer back into the attack immediately. Is that a pre-set rotation, or does Morgan want him to bowl at Smith before the batsman is set? If so, it doesn\u2019t work, because Finch sprints back for a second run to start the over, then cuts a single at the end to keep strike. 33rd over: Australia 175-2 (Finch 93, Smith 1) You don\u2019t really mind the wicket, do you if you\u2019re Australia? Because it brings Steve Smith to the crease, and he\u2019s exactly the hard-running accumulator you\u2019d like at this stage of an innings. He gets off the mark by driving to deep cover for one. Straight through him! No footwork from Khawaja, he just stood up and drove half-heartedly at Stokes and the ball zips through the gate to take down off stump. Big celebrations from Stokes, surprise surprise. The bowling change comes off. 32nd over: Australia 173-1 (Finch 92, Khawaja 23) Gorgeous from Finch, who is threatening to score another hundred. Rashid gives a lot of flight, the ball drops on a full length, and Finch is there waiting for it like a wolf at the door, licking his chops. He drives it through cover dreamily. 31st over: Australia 166-1 (Finch 88, Khawaja 20) I\u2019m liking this Stokes change. It\u2019s opened up a contest. Finch square drives him gorgeously for what should be four, but Archer does well on the rope to save. Then Stokes zings through a bouncer that Finch can\u2019t get near on the hook. Willing. 30th over: Australia 162-1 (Finch 85, Khawaja 19) Rashid from the Pavilion End, where I suppose the slope would help his googly? Tell me if you know more about this weird angled ground than I. Khawaja is quick to sweep again when the opportunity presents, for a couple more runs. I\u2019m sensing a certain theme in Kanishk Srinivasan\u2019s correspondence. \u201cAt the risk of attracting a lot of hate and online boos, I\u2019m really hoping Australia win this as a neutral (so not really neutral). But England losing here would open the doors ever so slightly for Bangladesh to pop them to that fourth semi-formal spot, which would be amazing. Plus, I think Australia have gone through some self-induced extremely difficult times, so maybe getting to the semis would do them some good. And then they could placate their haters by crashing out by losing to Bangladesh. What say?\u201d 29th over: Australia 158-1 (Finch 84, Khawaja 16) Stokes is back, giving Moeen a break. And perhaps seam is England\u2019s better option just now, with three prodded runs, a couple of miscues, and a ball that jags and beats Finch in a more menacing fashion than anything Moeen sent down. Finch is very capable of monstering spinners on a good day. 28th over: Australia 155-1 (Finch 82, Khawaja 15) Missed stumping! That was a straightforward one for Buttler. Rashid hung the ball up there, drew Khawaja forward, beat his push, and dragged his back foot out. The ball skipped through but hit the heels of Buttler\u2019s hands and bounced back. I don\u2019t think he even really reacted to that ball in time. Khawaja celebrates his reprieve with the exuberance of a man released from prison, reverse-sweeping a four immediately. 27th over: Australia 148-1 (Finch 81, Khawaja 9) Eight more from Moeen\u2019s over, as Finch ends it with an edge to third man for four. Moeen has conceded 42 in 36 balls. 26th over: Australia 141-1 (Finch 76, Khawaja 7) England\u2019s spinners rattling through the overs, as must I. Lots of great emails coming in, thank you all. Rashid concedes a single, then a brace thanks to Root\u2019s misfield. 25th over: Australia 138-1 (Finch 74, Khawaja 6) Singles, singles, the Finch clouts Moeen straight for six! That was such a casual easy swing of the bat. It looked like long-on might be in play for a minute, but the ball sailed over his head. Finch makes it looks simple. 24th over: Australia 129-1 (Finch 67, Khawaja 4) A quiet over from Rashid, with Khawaja sweeping a couple. He does love the sweeps, in all their forms. Big fan of Dick van Dyke. \u201cAt the risk of betraying both of my cricketing prejudices,\u201d warns Brian Withington, \u201cthe only Australian bowler I want to have a good one today is Peter Siddle at Chelmsford.\u201d The great Pierre Siddel. Back him in every time. 23rd over: Australia 125-1 (Finch 66, Khawaja 1) So an eventful over, that one. Finch whacks a couple to cover, then blasts a six over midwicket via his meaty slog-sweep. Loves that shot, getting his front foot well forward, dropping his knees and blasting through the line. Then Warner\u2019s wicket falls, and Usman Khawaja comes out at first drop. Played well last time out against Bangladesh, needs to do it again. Thanks Martin! And thanks Moeen, who finally gets reward for England. It was the bounce wot did it, Your Honour. Width outside off, Warner looks to cut, but the ball leaps on him and takes the top edge, looping tamely to point. The Big Bad Wolf is out, and gets a fair razzing from the crowd as he leaves. Either that or they\u2019re saying \u201cRooooooooot\u201d for the catch. 22nd over: Australia 114-0 (Finch 56, Warner 53) Rashid with this over. Just a couple of singles, but one of them moves Warner from 499 runs to 500 in this edition of the World Cup. Ridiculous numbers really. 21st over: Australia 112-0 (Finch 55, Warner 52) Finally a quiet over for England, as Moeen starts looping his deliveries up, and Finch decides he\u2019s content to be watchful for a few deliveries. Two singles in the end. Martin Sinclair is halfway out the door. \u201cThis has been a difficult morning and I\u2019m wondering whether we\u2019re watching the wheels coming off the England wagon. Yes, we can beat anyone on our day, but we can also lose to anyone and we all know about England\u2019s fabled mental fortitude and ability to grind out wins under pressure. Er... Having followed the morning\u2019s play obsessively up till now, I feel I have to take a break in case it it is my close attention that is jinxing us. I\u2019ll check back in later when hopefully the score is around 154/6. See you then!\u201d Come come, Martin. What happened to that famed Britannia spirit engendered by blue passports or somesuch? I don\u2019t know the details, I\u2019m not from around here. 20th over: Australia 110-0 (Finch 54, Warner 51) The run twins are at it again, with a drive for one from Rashid. Matching fifties, and in such an adorable shade! They look cute. So is Thomas Taylor. \u201cIs there anything better than staying up \u2018til half four in the morning to watch England vs. Australia in a bar in Mexico with your Spanish girlfriend asleep in your arms?\u201d I can\u2019t speak specifically to that experience, Thomas, but I can say that a lot of people have fallen asleep watching cricket with me. 19th over: Australia 106-0 (Finch 52, Warner 49) A couple more runs out to deep midwicket, and Finch has his fifty. In this World Cup he has 66, 6, 36, 82, 153, 53, and now 52 not out. And that 36 he was smashing it but got run out. If you want something more sedate, here\u2019s our county cricket live blog. 18th over: Australia 100-0 (Finch 48, Warner 47) Double spin change, with Adil Rashid\u2019s leg-breaks from the Pavilion End. And Warner goes after him immediately. This must be a plan. First ball, tonked over mid-off for a couple. Third ball, pulled for four. Fifth ball, driving hard past a diving Moeen at mid-off. Ten from the over, all to Warner, and that\u2019s the eighth century partnership in ODIs for this pair, and their third in this World Cup. Australia cruising. 17th over: Australia 90-0 (Finch 48, Warner 37) Moeen versus Warner. This match-up has some history. England\u2019s off-spinner starts up from the Nursery End, fittingly given he and his wife have just had a baby daughter. Warner drives a couple out into the deep, then gets two bonus overthrows from a nudge for a single, as Morgan\u2019s throw is wild to Buttler. A couple of sedate singles, seven from the over, and Australia continue to cruise. A round of applause for Porus Patwari, everyone. \u201cLong time lurker, first time poster here.\u201d See, we\u2019re not so scary. \u201cOn the subject of Morgan saying that it would take time to earn trust for the famed duo, I would like to insert the case of Mohammed Amir (as I like to do in any cricket conversation I can). My clear bias and love for him aside, I think he is a shining example of how one can turn the tide on even the most vocal of critics by good behavior, penchant for repentance and of course, searing pace when bowling. His redemption arc should be taught in schools. I think I might have digressed but yeah, you get the gist. I am sure Rob would agree.\u201d I would never dare speak for Rob, he would flay me with a horse-hair switch for my insolence. But yes: keep being good at cricket, and keep playing with a smile on your face. Of course, it probably makes a difference when you\u2019re a teenage player being led astray by an older crooked leader rather than being the... err... older crooked leader. 16th over: Australia 83-0 (Finch 47, Warner 31) Mark Wood and his imaginary horse are being tonked today. Amongst a few streaky moments, like when Finch almost lifts a ball to mid-off. But around that Finch pulls fine to the fence, and crashes another straight drive. He\u2019s having a wild World Cup, Finch. Drinks. 15th over: Australia 75-0 (Finch 39, Warner 31) That\u2019s Warner looking good. Only for a single, but first ball from Ben Stokes sees Warner up on the balls of his feet, opening the blade and punching effortlessly behind point, crisply timed. That\u2019s how he has scored so many of his Test runs the last few years, and it\u2019s a sign of his game in good order. Perhaps things are slowly starting to come together. It\u2019s this strange situation where he\u2019s made an absolute pile of runs despite not hitting the ball as convincingly as he has at his best. 14th over: Australia 71-0 (Finch 37, Warner 29) And Warner carries on doing what Warner does, not quite timing his own shots but piling up runs nonetheless. He hangs back and drags a pull shot from Wood over mid-on, where it hung in the air for a minute but dropped into the plentiful safe acres beyond Moeen Ali. Warner then flicks three to midwicket, before Finch plays his own cramped pull shot over midwicket. Wood bowls a wide, then finally pulls things back with a couple of dots, but the over costs a dozen. 13th over: Australia 59-0 (Finch 33, Warner 22) This has to be one of the best wicketless opening spells in a one-dayer. Woakes has Finch completely mistiming his drive, aiming through mid-off but dragging away through mid-on. Of course a few people still have to say \u201cShot!\u201d because the ball went relatively straight for four, but it was never controlled. Then Woakes bowls a hand grenade, a ball that takes off from a good length, flying up to chest height as it passes Finch, the soaring through to the keeper. It jagged off the seam too. Literally unplayable. But as Woakes pitches fuller looking for something similarly unexpected, Finch thrashes a straight drive that does connect well for four. 12th over: Australia 50-0 (Finch 25, Warner 22) Mark Wood will be the first bowling change, on for Archer. Pace for pace. And he delivers first up, nailing Finch on the hip in an unpadded region, which causes a fair bit of pain. It must bruise up badly there where it\u2019s basically skin and bone. Wood errs with the next ball though, and even the uncomfortable Finch can glance it for four. Then a leg bye, and Warner finishes the over by aiming a huge drive at a ghost ball \u2013 it was never there. Whoooooo. Ok, by popular demand you can all blast Farnsy one more time. 11th over: Australia 44-0 (Finch 21, Warner 22) Another Woakes over, another big miscue from Finch as his off-side drive fetches an on-side run. Woakes is swinging the ball into Warner, the left-hander, and denying him any space. Warner is happy to wait this spell out, it seems. 10th over: Australia 44-0 (Finch 20, Warner 22) Archer just errs in length this over, and Warner is exactly the opportunist to take full toll. First he steps across and flips a couple of runs behind square, with only a great sprint from Rashid around from fine leg and a tumbling save preventing a boundary. Then Warner nails his cut shot to a ball just fractionally short, and gets four through point. He\u2019s gone past Finch\u2019s score. 9th over: Australia 36-0 (Finch 19, Warner 15) Woakes! He\u2019s bowling a beautiful spell here. Cuts the ball savagely, twice in the over, once through each batsman. One run from the over, from a push off the hip. He\u2019s all over it today, England\u2019s opening bowler. Matt Dony emails in. \u201cAdvance Australia Fair? Surely John Farnham\u2019s anthemic You\u2019re The Voice is the most inspiring. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m yet to see coverage of a major Australian event that doesn\u2019t have it playing in the background at some point. You guys sure love Farnham.\u201d We sure do. Apparently it\u2019s not even his song, it\u2019s a cover. But I don\u2019t know want to know about it. Whoah-oh, oh oh, oh oh-oh-oh... 8th over: Australia 35-0 (Finch 19, Warner 14) Archer is really going smoothly now. He\u2019s bowling with the slope at Lord\u2019s, from the Pavilion End, and decking the ball appreciably. Back of a length, pushing both batsmen back, not giving any room. The only scoring shot is Warner getting an airborne three through midwicket. The Airborne Three. They solve plane crimes, I guess? Serialisation rights available on request. Here, have a read about Ian Botham being Ian Botham. 7th over: Australia 32-0 (Finch 19, Warner 11) Finch survives the review and gets off strike. Warner plays a strange sort of shot, going deep in his crease to a half-volley and then lifting it almost off the toe of the bat, over mid-off for four. Trying to get going. Then England almost review again, as Woakes buzzsaws Warner in two with a ball carving past his inside edge and over the stumps. Woakes things it took an edge, but is dissuaded. Leg before shout... Woakes hits him in front of middle, but high and with some angle on the delivery. The umpire says no, England say let\u2019s check, and the review finds that it was at best clipping the leg bail. Umpire\u2019s call, England keep the review, Finch keeps his wicket. 6th over: Australia 26-0 (Finch 18, Warner 6) Jofra Archer to Finch, who drives and is dropped! The Aussie skipper has been put down by James Vince at backward point. Jason Roy would have caught that. You\u2019ve just dropped a potentially quite useful two points at the World Cup. Et cetera. No, it was a very tough one. High and to his right, Vince flew across into the frame slow-motion like a pelican coming in to land. Got good airtime. Got fingertips to it. Wasn\u2019t much of a chance to fluke that one. Call it a quarter chance. But Finch has played a gaggle of false shots thus far. 5th over: Australia 23-0 (Finch 15, Warner 6) Finch looks good when he hits them. Woakes gets too short and Finch nails the pull shot through midwicket. Then knocks a single to the leg side. Abhijato is quick off the email mark. \u201cEngland were supposed to be the best team in this World Cup, but their performances haven\u2019t shown that. Their last three matches are virtual must-wins against the three best teams of the tournament if they are to make it to the knockouts - an objective which the ECB has invested a lot in fulfilling (while also sacrificing their overall domestic structure\u2019s overall stability). The following three matches might just be the most important in their cricketing history...\u201d Hugely significant, I agree. But the importance only underlines the disconnect, where the ECB have invested to make their 50-over team the best in the world, while actively planning to destroy 50-over cricket at domestic level and make it into a second-rate apprenticeship competition. 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Finch 10, Warner 6) Archer hasn\u2019t taken long to settle. Bowls a peach to Finch, back of a length and seaming away with a sizzle off the pitch. Finch eventually gets another high edge through a vacant area behind point, then to close the over Warner gets a ball leg-side enough to pull it fine for four. 3rd over: Australia 13-0 (Finch 9, Warner 2) Chris Woakes gives Warner a working over around off stump, but Warner is resolute in defence. Watching carefully, not willing to try anything, not until the last ball of the over which Warner chops hard into the ground behind point. It looks ungainly, but it\u2019s safe, and it nets him two runs to get off the mark. 2nd over: Australia 11-0 (Finch 9, Warner 0) Jofra Archer to start from the Pavilion End. His first ball to Australia in what will hopefully be a long and beautiful friendship. It\u2019s a peace offering, floated up outside off stump and driven by Finch for four! Top shot, splitting the cover field along the ground. Jofra gets his length right after that, and Finch watchfully plays out the over. Punch and counter. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Finch 5, Warner 0) Chris Woakes will get this who on the road. Finch facing the first ball without incident, then edging the second over slip! Went for it hard, as he does, and got a thick airborne edge. Away for four. Then a couple of leg byes off the thigh pad, and a single to cover. Warner gets stranded by a ball that moves away appreciably, so much so that I don\u2019t think you could say that he played at it. Eventful start. Morning / evening / International Space Station orbit to you all. Which is the more inspiring song: Advance Australia Fair, or Stand By, by Rudimental? A titanic battle for the ages. It\u2019s humid and grey and not too warm here in London. A wet dog sort of day. What will that do to the ball? Let\u2019s find out. Speaking of Geoff, here he is to take over the OBO controls and guide you through the Australian innings. Cheerio from me. \u201cEven two-thirds of the way through the Cricket World Cup group stage we are still waiting for teams to peel off their false moustaches and reveal who they really are,\u201d writes Geoff Lemon in his match preview. For a team blessed with a rich history of facial hair, these Australians are actually relatively clean shaven for this tournament. Just Starc, Richardson and Warner can claim to have top lip slugs, and none stand alone \u2013 they\u2019re all part of a wider bearded look. Boon, Hughes and Mitchell Johnson in Movember these are not. Anyway, just a thought that entirely misses the point of Geoff\u2019s excellent article, which you can read here: But first we\u2019ll have the anthems. Advance Australia first. The players lock arms as a giant cricket ball covered in an Australian flag floats in the background. If that doesn\u2019t bring a tear to your eye, nothing will. And now God Save the Queen. Nearly ready to go. \u201cI was at Jimmy Anderson\u2019s book launch recently when he commented that Virat Kohli wasn\u2019t being nice in asking Indian fans not to boo,\u201d writes Evelyn Williames. \u201cHe realised that the booing just encouraged them (as it did Stuart Broad in Australia).\u201d We\u2019re about to find out, with Warner under 10 minutes away from walking out onto the hallowed Lord\u2019s turf, alongside his opening partner Aaron Finch. Today is a big test for England. And it\u2019s not going to get any easier in their remaining two matches. Let\u2019s not forget who lies in store for the hosts in their remaining two games after Australia: India and New Zealand. Defeat today could seriously damage their hopes of reaching the semis, especially with Bangladesh breathing down their necks \u2013 who are now just a point behind after victory in Southampton 24 hours ago. Just to confirm those line-ups: Morgan flips the coin, Finch calls wrongly and England will bowl first in the overcast conditions. In terms of teams, Morgan confirms England are unchanged after Archer passed a late fitness test. \u201cHe\u2019s good. He had a little stiffness in his side the last two games,\u201d Morgan says, before saying he\u2019s now good to go. Finch admits he wasn\u2019t sure whether to bat or bowl if he won the toss. Don\u2019t worry about that, Aaron. Two changes for Australia: in come Nathan Lyon, for his first match this tournament, and Jason Behrendorff with Adam Zampa and Nathan Coulter-Nile the men to give way. The captain doth protest too much. Here\u2019s the inimitable Vic Marks, on Morgan and the fact that is most certainly not a hum-drum, just-another-game for England. Eoin Morgan is entitled not to over-hype the occasion and to keep his players cool. But the protestation that this is just a routine World Cup match was not entirely convincing. In fact, if England had beaten Sri Lanka at Headingley his view of Tuesday\u2019s mouthwatering meeting with Australia would have more credence. It is true that England can lose at Lord\u2019s and still control their own destiny in this tournament as they strive to satisfy the bare minimum of expectations: reaching the semi-finals. But if Australia prevail then the nerves really start jangling, however icy-calm Morgan may like to appear. Then England might have to win both their remaining matches, against India and New Zealand, neither of whom have been beaten so far. More on the weather. The importance of the weather radar to everyone\u2019s enjoyment today cannot be underestimated. There\u2019s cloud cover hanging over Lord\u2019s, but importantly no rain and we\u2019re set to get underway with no delay. Team news. Confirmed XIs obviously won\u2019t be in until a bit later, but Jofra Archer has been suffering from a side problem and underwent a late fitness test at Lord\u2019s. He\u2019s passed it, according to OBOer Adam Collins. And Michael Vaughan has just said on the telly that Nathan Lyon may make an appearance for Australia. \u201cRegaining trust takes a lot of time\u201d. For anyone fearing the Lord\u2019s crowd may delight in getting on the backs of the two players at the centre of the aforementioned scandal, thank goodness then for England captain Eoin Morgan, who took the opportunity on the eve of the match to pour cold water on any hot heads wanting to have a pop at poor old Dave Warner and Steve Smith. No, not really, they\u2019re fair game apparently. Hello and welcome. Sydney calling first up to set the scene ahead of today\u2019s hugely-anticipated meeting at Lord\u2019s, before handing over to London for the start of play (10:30am local, 7:30pm AEST). It hardly needs hyping, such is the, um, special relationship between these two countries, but the fact that this gives England fans a chance to remind their antipodean cousins of the time Australian cricket imploded in Cape Town 15 months ago is sure to only add even more heat to an already five-chilli occasion. But it\u2019s not just about two very naughty boys seeking a kind of redemption and some inevitably cheap jokes emanating from the stands today. There\u2019s a Cricket World Cup on, and with just two points separating the sides heading into this fixture, there\u2019s table position to play for. Australia sit in second on 10 points, with England fourth on eight, both having played six games. An Australian win will see them leapfrog New Zealand into top spot and put a huge dent in England\u2019s hopes of reaching the semis; defeat will see England draw level on points. First place plays fourth and second plays third in the semis. Anyway, please do feel free to get in touch with any thoughts on today\u2019s match. I\u2019ll try to field any emails before handing over to Geoff for the first ball. It\u2019s mike.hytner@theguardian.com on email or @mike_hytner on Twitter.
