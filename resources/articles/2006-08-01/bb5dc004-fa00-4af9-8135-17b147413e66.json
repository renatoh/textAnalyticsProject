And not every day that your team enters the arena to the crackle of fireworks. On this loud and proud occasion, it was a tribute to Reading that they triumphed over their first Premiership opponents and the heavy atmosphere in their own home. Reading travelled for 135 years to reach this day, so they can be forgiven losing their way for just 21 minutes. This was a rapid learning curve for a side without a single second of experience at the top. At the end, it was the management apprentice whose fingers were burned. Welcome to the big game, Gareth Southgate. When TV cameras panned to Brian Barwick and Terry Venables, they captured glum expressions. A first-minute snap of Southgate showed understandable tension. But the most illuminating picture was that of Steve Coppell, who during the dark opening remained poker-faced. Even with all his experience, that took some doing in this Madejski madhouse. Despite a comeback featuring three goals in 12 minutes, Coppell was far from carried away. He parried excited questions like whether his team could \"surprise\" the Premiership. \"There's no surprises now,\" was the laconic reply, \"because everything is dissected 100 times. It was important to win today. But in the long term, who knows? They have to prove themselves, prove they're not a one-hit wonder.\" With due respect to the Middlesbrough manager who was once his player, Coppell also knows his team will meet far better opponents than Boro, who in gaining a new managerial head have lost an old one in defence. With the injured Ugo Ehiogu also missing, Southgate fielded what could charitably be called a makeshift defence. Their misery here was best summed up by Julio Arca departing halfway through his debut with a foot problem, suffered in a collision with team-mate Chris Riggott. At least that released the left-back from the torment inflicted by another debutant, Seol Ki-hyeon, a 6ft 2in winger who grew, like Reading, with the game. The South Korean created two goals and in the second half tortured Stuart Parnaby, switching from the right as Southgate ordered his first managerial reshuffle. The new boss eventually went from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2. This boldness was to no avail. The fixture's computer has dealt Southgate a real bummer of a hand. Chelsea visit on Wednesday and Boro's next trips are to Arsenal and Bolton. The 35-year-old is learning managerspeak fast. Of facing the champions, he said: \"It won't need me to lift the players. They will love to play in a game like that.\" On Mark Viduka's late, incorrectly disallowed shot, he said: \"He looked level. But I'm not going to gripe about the decisions.\" Both men had good reason to gripe about the officials. Southgate faced transfer questions. Are Spurs and Chelsea moving for Stewart Downing? \"I don't know about that,\" he said, looking genuinely puzzled. Sylvain Distin? \"He's thinking things over.\" Robert Huth? \"We're talking to Chelsea.\" Reading lost Dave Kitson with a knee injury after a lunge from behind by Riggott which demanded a red rather than a yellow card. Seol was poleaxed as Fabio Rochemback ran into him; again the wrong card was issued, even after consultation with a linesman. Kitson, Coppell suggested, will be out for several games. The officials were by no means a bemused minority amid airport-like scenes. Passes went astray with the frequency of baggage. People queued to make basic mistakes. At the back, non-communication ruled. Leroy Lita prodded the winner after a three-man pile-up in the box; Marcus Hahnemann bungled Rochemback's free-kick for Yakubu Aiyegbeni to tap in; Kitson set up his goal with an inadvertent shin connection; and Graeme Murty ventured he was guilty of \"shocking defending\" before Downing's beautifully taken volley. But Reading's captain was getting ready to celebrate victory over his hometown club, who rejected him at 15, and 5ft 1in, for being too short. \"I'll have a cheeky lemonade tonight,\" he chortled, standing to his full height of 5ft 10in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
