Mexican Radio is a funny song and expresses how I feel about vacuous chit-chat. I'm currently living in digs in Bristol, rehearsing for The Three Musketeers at Bristol Old Vic over Christmas - I walk past SS Great Britain every day, which is very inspiring. But in London, I live five minutes from Chelsea so the Fratellis' song Chelsea Daggers is particularly apt. Turn it Up gives me an injection of energy as the title suggests, followed by some Ladytron, because it's just so cool. I do like things that aren't very emotional to listen to. The Birdman of EC1 (St Etienne) is so sweet and gentle, and riddled with a childlike nostalgia. It reminds me that I'm not such a wicked chap after all - despite my part as the evil Cardinal Richelieu. 1 Mexican Radio, Wall of Voodoo 2 Chelsea Daggers, The Fratellis 3 Turn it Up, Robots in Disguise 4 Destroy Everything You Touch, Ladytron 5 The Birdman of EC1, St Etienne"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
