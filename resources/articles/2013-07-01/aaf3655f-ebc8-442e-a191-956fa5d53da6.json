Some of the weaponry, including semtex explosives supplied by Libya, once belonged to the Provisional IRA, which was supposed to have decommissioned it. Fifteen kilogrammes of semtex was discovered on land at the Old Airport Road in north Dublin on Thursday as well as guns \u2013 including a gold-painted revolver, shotguns and an Uzi sub-machine gun \u2013 electronic jamming devices and more than 1,300 rounds of ammunition. The explosives, guns and ammunition belong to the new IRA, a merger of the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs and a number of independent armed republican units who announced their alliance in a statement to the Guardian last summer. Irish police said on Thursday evening that they believed the explosives had been stolen from Provisional IRA arms dumps even though the mainstream republican movement said it had decommissioned its semtex, which had been supplied by Libyan dictator Colonel Gadaffi. Superintendent David Taylor said the seizure was a major setback to the activities of dissident republicans and is one of the largest discoveries of illegal weapons in recent years. He said the only function of the guns and bombs was to kill and maim and that there was no doubt that the seizure had saved lives. The police said the semtex was old and very different from what is currently available, which is more rigorously controlled and harder to acquire. This indicates that this semtex was originally controlled by PIRA and should have been destroyed in the decommissioning process. The seizure will raise questions from hardline unionists about the decommissioning process, which they insisted was a precursor to Sinn F\u00e9in entering government in Northern Ireland. The find is among of a string of security successes by the Irish police against the New IRA, especially in Dublin. The discovery of former PIRA semtex will provoke accusations that the Provisionals pulled the wool over the eyes of those overseeing the decommissioning of their arsenal. In August 2005, the senior IRA figure liaising with the Independent International Committee on Decommissioning (IICD) gave an assurance that all the organisation's semtex \"was put beyond use\". Since then, small amounts of the explosive have turned up in several arms finds although not in the same quantity.But Garda\u00ed sources now believe a substantial amount of the explosive may have been hidden away before the decommissioning process began. In 2005, the supposed decommissioning process was hailed by the British and Irish governments, who briefed journalists that a complete decommissioning of IRA weapons had taken place. At the time of the decommissioning, praise was heaped on the committee headed by Canadian general John de Chastelain. West Belfast-based Catholic priest Fr Alex Reid and former Methodist president Rev Harold Good observed what was said to have been the decommissioning of the IRA's weaponry \u2013 including the semtex explosive. In a statement afterwards, the two clergymen said: \"We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA's arsenal.\" Decommissioning the tonnes of weapons controlled by the PIRA, many of them Libyan-supplied, was a cornerstone demand of unionists before they would even consider entering into a power sharing government with Sinn F\u00e9in. Questions will now be raised whether the semtex captured by the Garda\u00ed was either stolen from PIRA arms dumps or was handed over to the dissidents by mainstream republicans still sympathetic to those involved in \"armed struggle\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
