While lower slopes in Engelberg are nothing to get excited about, a depth of 330cm on upper slopes is a sign that things are improving in Europe. The temperature is -9C (16F) and snow flurries are forecast. Andermatt is also looking good, with 230cm of packed powder on upper slopes, although the lower slopes have just 55cm. The resort of Saas Fee is also performing well, with 225cm on upper slopes. Andorra is holding its own, despite a lack of new snow recently. Low temperatures mean that the early snow is still giving good cover, and 95 per cent of pistes are open. Kitzb\u00fchel in Austria has received a mammoth dump this week. The fall of 110cm is probably the dump of the season and ski conditions are good. Chandolin/Anniviers in Switzerland also had a healthy fall, 60cm in one drop. Further afield, Canada's Big White resort is living up to its name with 195cm of snow on both upper and lower slopes. The big news in North America this week, however, is that snow has finally hit Vermont. Snow-making machines have been keeping the resorts open, but now the natural snow has finally arrived. A snowstorm hit the seven mountains of Killington on 6 January, dumping 30-35cm. Until then, the resort had received just 48cm of natural snow in total. Deal of the week There is plenty of room in Andorra for February. Club Pavilion is offering seven-night trips departing from Gatwick or Manchester on 10, 17 and 24 February.

Website of the week www.skipages.com calls itself 'your complete ski and snowboard directory' and it does seem to live up to its promises. The beauty of the site is that it has its own search engine. This might only have 1,114 links, but each is guaranteed to come with a dusting of snow. The site hosts free auctions for those who want to offload old ski gear or upgrade without paying hefty store prices. Its resort reviews come from ordinary skiers who have visited the places and rate each one on 13 different counts, beating the brochures for detail and honesty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
