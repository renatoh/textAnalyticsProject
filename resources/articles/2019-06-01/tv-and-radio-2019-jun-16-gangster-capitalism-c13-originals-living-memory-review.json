In March of this year, federal prosecutors revealed that certain wealthy American families paid for their children to get into the \u201cright\u201d elite universities. They did this by contacting a man called Rick Singer. Singer got the parents to have their kids categorised as having a learning disability. This meant that they could take their SAT or ACTs in a special centre, where a supervisor, paid off by Singer, would either take the child\u2019s test themselves or alter it so it had more correct answers (a high SAT/ACT score gets you into the best colleges). Sometimes this wasn\u2019t enough, so Singer would also arrange for the child to suddenly acquire an exceptional sporting talent, such as being a rowing cox or a \u201ckicker\u201d for American football. The parents paid Singer a lot of money for this service: sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands. Singer used that money to pay off college admissions administrators, sports coaches, test invigilators, but he also kept millions for himself. Oooh, this was a proper lip-smacker, complete with famous people (actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin; also Loughlin\u2019s child, Olivia Jade, a YouTube star). Real fraud that we could all understand: no complicated offshore tax systems, just straightforward payment for straightforward cheating. If you coughed up the money, you got your child in. Andrew Jenks has made a podcast about this scandal for C13 Originals: impressive, given the short time frame. Though the series suffers a little from being made in a hurry \u2013 encounters with Singer come to nought, interviews are sometimes left to run too long \u2013 Jenks\u2019s five-parter is genuinely gripping stuff. Using real-life transcripts, actors voice the parts of Singer and his co-conspirators utterly convincingly; and there are a couple of subtle points made by contributors, including one who points out that, though this seems like a case of cash, it\u2019s actually a case of racism, too. Gangster Capitalism seems to be setting itself up as a strand, rather than a one-off series, which is fair enough. Capitalism has a lot of dodgy ethics to be explored. But as I listened to Jenks gamely advertising all his show\u2019s sponsors during the episodes, I did wonder just how large a task he\u2019s taking on. We\u2019re all capitalists, because capitalism is the system we operate within. And every one of this great show\u2019s sponsors \u2013 clever phone-charging luggage, mattresses that adjust to different needs, delivery food whenever you want \u2013 are fulfilling an itch that doesn\u2019t really need scratching. Capitalism seeks to commercialise all our everyday experiences and desires. It is always gangster. Hey ho, tra la la. Let\u2019s turn to people who might have a different attitude to life. On Radio 4\u2019s Living Memory last week, we heard from selected centenarians. On Monday, we met Bob, who is, at 111, the joint oldest man in Britain. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what I\u2019m supposed to feel like,\u201d he said. As with all the other 100-plussers in this lovely series, Bob was philosophical and honest. Life, he said, was about \u201chuman relationships, and that doesn\u2019t change with age\u201d. Beautifully produced by Falling Tree, the rest of the series blended different voices into each 15-minute show. On Friday, we heard from two actors: Earl, an African American who chose acting when he realised that racism meant he otherwise would only get menial jobs, and June Spencer, AKA The Archers\u2019 Peggy Woolley, whose 100th birthday was on the day of broadcast. After her husband died, 18 years ago, she said to herself: \u201cThis is my time, there\u2019s no one to look after but myself.\u201d Earl had a few regrets \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve committed many sins\u201d \u2013 but he thought similarly. \u201cIn the time of your life: live,\u201d he said. And then he said it again. Three podcasts that started out as a wheeze It Burns A new Audible series in which Australian journalist Marc Fennell decides he\u2019s going to find the world\u2019s hottest chilli. It opens with Fennell in an Arizona flash flood in a rubbish pac-a-mac, alongside several other nutters, at a hot-pepper-eating contest. So far, so Jackass, but the five-episode story expands into a world competition over who can grow the hottest chilli, with requisite cheating and scandal. More interestingly, Fennell dives into why the chilli-heads are doing it (this involves more childhood trauma than you might expect). Fennell is an engaging host and this series is fun, sad, and informative. The Worst Idea of All Time TWIOAT started five years ago and is an amazing, almost existential, investigation into what happens when you watch the same terrible film every week for a year. So far, over four series, New Zealand comedians Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery have watched Grown Ups 2, Sex and the City 2, We Are Your Friends and the first film adaptation of Sex and the City (they\u2019re nearly at the end of that 52-part run). The show is as you imagine, full of daft bantz, and is now so successful that Batt and Montgomery do live performances, and a spin-off side podcast, Friendzone. Me1 vs Me2 Snooker A continuing snooker match played by Richard Herring against himself. He\u2019s the commentator too. Herring is a long-time podcast-maker \u2013 he also makes the highly successful live interview show RHLSTP (Richard Herring\u2019s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast), where he talks to fellow comedians - and his shows are rambling, funny, barely edited. He is very good at them. Me1 and Me2 have been playing snooker since 2011 (!). This is such a silly idea, I can\u2019t quite believe Herring is still doing it, but he is, and this amiable, utterly daft show has many fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
