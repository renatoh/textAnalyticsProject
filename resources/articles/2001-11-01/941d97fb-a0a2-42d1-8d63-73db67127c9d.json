Not because he is desperate for England to fall short, of course, but in the hope that he will be required elsewhere in the summer. \"To say I'm going is a long shot,\" he said recently of the World Cup, \"but you never know. Funny things happen. That's my aim.\" While David Platt tries to inspire his Three Lions cubs to repeat the 4-0 win over Holland with which he began his reign, his players have an added incentive to impress, with Japan and South Korea looming. For Dunn, Michael Carrick of West Ham, Tottenham's Ledley King and the Chelsea defender John Terry, elevation to the senior squad does not seem impossible. Dunn retains the captaincy in Utrecht despite Terry's return from suspension and last night paid tribute to another David - not Platt - for helping in his rise to the top, namely his grandfather. \"My grandad put all the time and effort in taking me to different things,\" he said, \"so I think that if, at 14 or 15, I'd turned round to him and said I didn't want to do it he'd have been a bit upset with me. \"If I have a bad game he's the first to tell me that. It's good that I've got a manager in Graeme Souness at Blackburn who keeps my feet on the ground, and my family is around me to keep my feet on the ground as well. When I was getting a bit too big for myself my grandad probably knocked me down a peg or two.\" Grandad has not had too many poor performances to criticise of late. Dunn scored spectacularly in a 7-1 win over West Ham, followed that with two goals at Arsenal and has been compared by Souness to Paul Gascoigne. Gascoigne played a memorable role in England's run to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup but has been hampered since by a tendency to self-destruct. Dunn knows the importance of looking after himself. \"If you ask any of the young players now, you've got to be dedicated and committed to what you want to be,\" he said. \"When your mates were going out on a Friday and Saturday night you had to stay in. It's a little bit frustrating but it's worked out for the best. There are a lot of young players who have the ability and everything it takes to be a professional footballer but a few of them fall by the wayside because they are not dedicated and because they want to do things their friends want to do.\" Platt will stress that victory tonight and in the return in Derby next Tuesday cannot be taken for granted despite the convincing win over Holland in August and his 100% record from four matches. \"That one's gone completely out of the window,\" he said of the Holland match. He has lost several players because of injury, notably Owen Hargreaves, Seth Johnson and Darius Vassell, but sounded excited at the thought of playing West Ham's Jermain Defoe, who scored twice against Holland. \"Defoe's got all the characteristics to go on and become a full international, but they need to be honed,\" Platt said. \"I don't find a fault. I can't find a weakness in his game, but he needs to hone his strengths. Michael Owen burst on to the scene with exceptional pace and a great attitude, a great work ethic. All that's happened with Michael is that he's gone on to a different level because his strengths have got better.\" With Francis Jeffers already ruled out, the other candidates to play up front tonight are Malcolm Christie of Derby and Newcastle's Shola Ameobi. The play-off victors will progress to May's finals in a country to be chosen from the qualifiers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
