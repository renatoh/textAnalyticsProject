The Sun columnist was airing his typically forthright views on council taxes when he broke off from his monologue, saying \"Fuck it! I'm so sorry.\" It transpired that he had been reading from an autocue in a pre-recorded segment which should have been consigned to the bin as soon as he uttered the expletive. But in a cock-up, the tape went out as part of an introduction to his live show. The programme was briefly interrupted after the incident on Littlejohn's December 4th show, before he reappeared on screen and told viewers: \"OK, well, we seem to have got an earlier recording there. We do apologise for that. Let's move on to our first story.\" But one viewer thought the apology was not for the use of offensive language and complained to Ofcom. The regulator upheld their complaint, ruling that Sky News had been in breach of programme codes. \"Sky News explained that they transmitted a wrong version. It had been a particularly busy few minutes in the run-up to the start of the programme, and this had contributed to the mistake,\" said the regulator. \"The broadcaster obviously regretted the mistake and any upset it had caused to viewers... This was clearly a technical mishap but Richard Littlejohn's subsequent apology to viewers seemed more in regret for the broadcast of the wrong tape than for the likely offence caused to viewers. The broadcaster did not issue any further apology at the end of the show.\" In a separate judgment, Fox News was censured after it devoted a four minute news bulletin to a range of beauty products being promoted by a US soap actress. Viewers were given product demonstrations of the range, Youthful Essence, and shown how to buy the items on the web by actress Susan Lucci. Ofcom said the item \"amounted to nothing more than an advertisement.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
