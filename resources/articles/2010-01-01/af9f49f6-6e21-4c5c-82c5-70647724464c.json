But while most women combat that dissatisfaction by dieting or going to the gym, 27-year-old Nic Green went to a startling extreme. She created a three-part, two-hour show that requires her and her fellow performers, three other women and a man, to be naked for much of its duration. And then she invited a bunch more women to strip off alongside them. Her show, Trilogy, which opens in London this week, was the hit of last year's Edinburgh fringe \u2013 which might seem unsurprising, considering its high quotient of bare breasts and buttocks. But there is nothing sexual about its naked dance sequences: this is a highly politicised, unashamedly feminist piece of theatre that sets out to celebrate not just women's bodies \u2013 of every shape and size \u2013 but their minds, achievements and aspirations, too. Audiences have found it so inspiring that they have stood and undressed for the closing rendition of Blake's hymn Jerusalem. Cheerful and forthright with a strong Yorkshire accent, Green cites her mother, a singer, and her female tutors at sixth-form college and Glasgow's Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) as the chief influences on her feminist thinking. From her teachers, she learned how to understand social differences, and to appreciate the power play within any group of people. As for her mother: \"When she decides she wants to do something, she does it \u2013 nothing stops her. Just being around that energy inspired me to feel I can do things.\" And yet, she says, her mother \"wouldn't say that she was a feminist at all\". In fact, since making Trilogy, Green has found a general lack of enthusiasm for the F-word. \"People often question: why does feminism still matter? For me it's liberating and exciting to think about what it means to be a woman living today. You have to acknowledge the difficulties and dissatisfactions \u2013 but my feminism is rooted in joyfulness.\" Trilogy started life in mid-2007, as a response to various experiences that had disturbed Green. One was a realisation she had while performing an earlier work, Cloud Piece, which also featured volunteers, this time girls aged eight to 11. On stage, the girls were a picture of perfect innocence as they joined Green in contemplating cloud formations. Off-stage, they liked to show off to the adults around them, using \"behaviour that was really sexual, copied from people like Girls Aloud. And they were already feeling self-conscious about their bodies. They would talk about their eating habits, and I'd think: 'You're eight! Where's the freedom in your life?'\" To top it off, she noticed that she frequently felt negative about, even \"threatened by\", her own body. She devised the first part of Trilogy while on holiday with her friend Laura Bradshaw, a classmate from RSAMD. \"I said to her, I'm thinking about making a choreography that is all about wobbling different parts of our bodies, presenting them as practical objects, instead of statuesque objets d'art. We'd done a bit of wobble stuff together before, so she said, yeah, go on then.\" Slowly they expanded this vignette, incorporating a striking video in which the pair visit a supermarket in gold bikinis, buy women's magazines and ask shoppers what they think of them. They called on volunteers to join in, and this led, in 2008, to the creation of Trilogy's third part, about other women's lives, from footage of a brutal stoning to a live phone call to Bradshaw's mother. \"Lots of the women who participate say they wish they could do more things that ask them to reflect on their femininity in a creative way, but there isn't the opportunity,\" says Green. She created a website, Make Your Own Herstory, which encourages women to do just that \u2013 through writing, doctoring their birth certificates, or filming themselves singing naked; it's a project she introduces at the end of each show. Trilogy's middle section is a response to Town Bloody Hall, a documentary made about a 1971 debate at New York's Town Hall between Norman Mailer and four leading feminists, including Germaine Greer. A friend of Green's showed her a bootleg copy of this little-seen recording (you can see clips on YouTube) and she became obsessed with it; she called on more friends to help her restage it. \"We learned all the words and voices and actions,\" she says. \"Eventually, we realised it was boring to recreate it.\" They decided to screen excerpts instead, and choreograph more naked work around it. What struck Green most about Town Bloody Hall was that Greer's introductory speech, dealing with the suppressive supremacy of male artists and the representation of women in art \"feels absolutely present: it could have been said a week ago\". And that the New York audience are vocal throughout: \"They have a passion and want to be heard. They are politicised people who want to have a say on real issues.\" This is how Green would describe herself, too. She speaks of a crisis among young people, and how they lack role models. She argues that a lot of the world's problems, be they economic, to do with food production, or climate change, could be tackled by \"putting more emphasis on community\". She is studying for a masters degree in human ecology, exploring \"how the relationship between human systems and natural systems is broken, and how it can be rebuilt\" \u2013 so that she can engage with climate change on a scientific and academic level. \"I'm an activist,\" she says. Green has chosen to be an activist through theatre: why? \"Because performance is rooted in action, and action is everything to me. I can't have a strong urgency about something and not take action.\" She means it: she recently moved into a house in east Ayrshire with her partner, theatre-maker Peter McMaster, two members of the Trilogy cast, and an environmental activist, to attempt a sustainable way of life: digging discarded wood out of skips for heating, sourcing food locally and so on. What fascinates her is the inter-relatedness of social problems. \"Trilogy looks at personal transformation, at trying to be better communicators, at being more conscientious, generous human beings. It looks at these things through the lens of feminism \u2013 but we could look at those same things through the lens of environmentalism.\" She is already mulling over her next piece, which will explore \"our relationship with place\". She doesn't know much more about it yet, except that it will definitely be participatory. \"That's one of the few things that are consistent in my work. I always want to spend time with other people and learn from what they know, which is absolutely what I don't know. I'm interested in the expertise of the everyday \u2013 there isn't always a space for that expertise to be celebrated.\" Trilogy is at BAC, London SW11 (020-7223 2223), until Saturday. Then touring. Trilogy is reviewed on page 40 of today's paper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
