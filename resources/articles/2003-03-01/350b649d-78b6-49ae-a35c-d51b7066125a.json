Some people don't mind, some are understandably a bit worried and don't like it, but you've just got to put on your white coat and hat and get on with it. We're looking to help and improve the businesses: we want to see a low incidence of food poisoning, through things like good hygiene, hand-washing, avoiding cross-contamination. We try to educate people at first or give them a warning, but sometimes it's so bad you have to prosecute straight away. There was a court case last week where one of the restaurants we'd inspected got a reasonable fine - that was a good case for us. Its wall-to-floor junctions were filthy, mouldy equipment was being used for food preparation, disgusting really. I think the public sector and environmental health is quite well perceived by people now. After recent campaigns about illegal meat, especially trying to clamp down on \"smokies\" [illegally slaughtered sheep], they know we're protecting them. I'm at the top of the salary scale for my post. We're going through a pay review at the moment and we're hoping it'll come out better - beneficial to the motivation. The salary is one of the main reasons I stay here in Bristol really. I live in south Wales and the smaller local authorities there don't offer the same sort of opportunities. Elsewhere in the country there are quite a lot of public sector jobs being advertised - there's a bit of a recruitment crisis at the moment. My job involves more paperwork now: I'll start my day auditing my team's paperwork, to check that their inspections have been OK, and sign them off. The next step up is management, so I've being doing some more training, a management course on day release. But at the moment I'm happy with what I'm doing - if you take on more responsibility it's more hassle, less flexible. Public voices: March 21 2002 Senior environmental health officer, Bristol City Council Salary: \u00a327,000 My team carries out hygiene inspections anywhere selling food: restaurants or corner shops, takeaways or a local factory. We look at the way they handle, cook, store and reheat food - do they wash their hands properly, and keep the cooked meat away from the raw? In the last year my job hasn't really changed, but the procedures and paperwork have increased since local authorities have been audited by the food standards agency. I've now submitted my MSc dissertation and I'm expecting to get my masters degree in Food Science and Technology. It gives me a bit more in-depth knowledge of what goes on in the manufacturing side of things. In my field, most people come into local government for experience after college. But once they're in, people start to move up the ranks and so they stay. There are opportunities as there's a shortage of specialists in environmental health. There don't seem to be many private consultancy jobs at the moment. Pay is definitely something that matters to me: if people are experienced and well-qualified they should be rewarded in line with other comparable professional occupations. Over the last year there have been improvements in flexible working. That's a really good thing. I could be a bit cynical about the government: they are trying to improve things but it's not easy to turn things round. Public servants have to work hard and definitely don't have an easy time. People here often stay late to get work done - they've got a lot of pride in their job. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Senior environmental health officer, Bristol City Council Salary: \u00a326,000 My job is food hygiene inspection, from small shops to restaurants to manufacturers, the whole scope of the food chain. We go to premises hazard-spotting - looking at things like machinery guarding, slippery floors, checking to see that they've got procedures and policies. Making sure someone puts a guard on a ham slicer might sound trivial, but it stops them chopping a finger off. You're doing something worthwhile, preventing accidents or illness that might ruin someone's life. Also, people might report a case of food poisoning and we'd investigate that. You see things like mouse of droppings on food, which is pretty bad - you could get closed down for that. I've seen worse, but I don't want to go into too much detail. . . We don't usually tell businesses when we're going to visit, but over a few years they get to recognise you. Usually you've got a good rapport because they know that you want to help them. I like my job: you get out and about, you get to meet people and you're not stuck in an office. It feels like you're achieving something, reducing the risk of food poisoning for the community. Potentially, premises could kill people - look at [the e-coli breakout in] Scotland. It's mainly a local authority job, but you can join a consultancy. The pay can be better but they work longer hours in commercial. I've been doing this seven years now, and did a 4-year environmental health degree, so it was definitely a professional vocation. The council gave me time off to do a masters. They train you quite well in the local authority. Working conditions are good and there are flexible hours. But with ongoing cutbacks in local government there's less staff and more work. You've got to fight for resources. The Food Standards Agency is now auditing local councils, checking the competency of their inspectors. And the council has to show it is providing a good service, cost-effective, show we're competitive with consultancies. There's all that sort of pressure now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
