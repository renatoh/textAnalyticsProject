The government said this week that two major reforms of the housing market had become victims of the decision to call an election on June 7 with some bills falling by the wayside. New laws forcing house sellers to put together a pack of information before putting their house on the market have been dropped along with legislation reforming the ownership arrangements for thousands of leaseholders. The Consumers' Association and the National Association of Estate Agents said they were disappointed the legislation bringing seller's packs was unlikely to become law this year. Ashley Holmes, legal director at the Consumers' Association, says the reforms \"would have cut out much of the hassle and speeded up house buying. It was a piece of consumer-friendly legislation and we will be pressing for it to be brought back to parliament after the election\". Even if the homes bill -which contains the new rules - is re-introduced in the autumn it will almost cer tainly delay plans to enforce it next year. Seller's packs were hailed by ministers as a radical departure from the usual way of buying and selling a home. The seller must commission a survey from an independent surveyor and provide other information such as a local search by the local authority of any relevant planning permission that might affect the sale. The information must be ready and in a standard format before a sale notice can go up or the seller runs the risk of prosecution. At the moment the onus is on the buyer to check the property they are purchasing. Many proposed house sales come to grief when a survey for the buyer reveals costly defects after a price has already been agreed and both buyer and seller are part of a long chain. A report for the government calculated that up to \u00a31m a day is wasted following the collapse of chains when one or more homebuyer pulls out. The seller's pack, ministers said, eliminates much of the uncertainty that buyers experience, resulting in a faster process and less waste. One large agency chain, Countrywide Assured, says it has dealt with 10,000 failed transactions already this year. Some MPs disagreed, claiming that sellers in areas with houses worth less than \u00a310,000 could not justify the \u00a3400-\u00a3500 cost of a pack and would find their homes impossible to sell. The bill was also held up in the House of Lords after a report by the Law Society said forcing sellers to include a survey in the pack was unfair. Some estate agents, mainly small independent chains, said the whole scheme placed unnecessary costs on sellers at time when the introduction of new technology was speeding up the house buying process anyway. Reform of leasehold laws was supposed to signal an end to the reign of nightmare landlords. But unlike the outpourings of regret over the loss of the homes bill, the commonhold-leasehold reform bill was given a gleeful burial by the people it primarily affected. The Coalition for the Abolition of Leasehold says the bill was totally inadequate and a \"typical New Labour fudge\". It proposed a new right for nearly 2m flat and house leaseholders to take over the management of their building without having to prove landlords' shortcomings and without paying them compensation. But it involved setting up a company, with all the added complications of company law, when that was completed the landlord was allowed to sit on the board. The government was unable this week to say if the bills would be re-introduced if it is re-elected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
