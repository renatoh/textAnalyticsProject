The Glasgow-born MP's offence was to repeat his previously stated views that Scottish devolution - which the Tories belatedly embraced - might be improved by such measures as abolishing all 129 of Scotland's MSPs and letting the 59 Scots MPs at Westminster sit at the Holyrood parliament for two days a week to do the job instead. In his comments, to the Scotsman newspaper, he admitted that the Tories were not yet making new policies, but he said he wanted \"to make a contribution to the debate\". Many English Tory MPs have similar feelings, but only in private. Repetition of what is now heresy among their Scots colleagues, who are painfully rebuilding their shattered base in Scotland, produced howls of rage in Edinburgh. In a letter to Mr Howard, Mr Gray, who has sat for the seat of North Wiltshire since 1997, officially \"resigned\" last night, but there was little doubt he had been asked to step down. Another exiled Scot, Eleanor Laing, MP for Epping Forest, takes over as shadow secretary of state for Scotland. She is already shadow minister with responsibility for women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
