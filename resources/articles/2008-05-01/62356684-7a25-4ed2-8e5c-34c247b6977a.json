There isn't even one enlightened male thrown in to humanise the drama. I have tuned in every week, drawn in by a faux 1960s nostalgia for simpler, more modest times, and in the vain hope that the male characters will have evolved into something less vile and obnoxious, but have to switch off every episode as the misogyny is too suffocating. The only likable character is Peggy, but even she only manages to induce waves of pity. William Leith seems to have been seduced by the superficial aesthetics of the show - the clothing, the furniture, the seedy male ideal of female \"sexiness\". Like the Sopranos, Mad Men glorifies immoral bastards, but at least in the Sopranos there were strong female characters and an underlying respect for the roles and potential of the women.
