The feature debut from Noah Hawley pushes the idea that, once someone has ventured into space, readjusting to life back on Earth can be a struggle. This theme \u2013 of an all-consuming job that bends everything else out of shape \u2013 has been explored more successfully before, by Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s The Hurt Locker and by Portman herself in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Black Swan, among others. Here, however, there are tonal issues. Neither as coolly observational as The Hurt Locker nor as stridently bonkers as Black Swan, Lucy in the Sky is low on real insight and feels like a psychology column in a supermarket tabloid. Portman gives her all, but she out-classes this rather pedestrian telling of a story of stratospheric levels of obsession and ambition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
