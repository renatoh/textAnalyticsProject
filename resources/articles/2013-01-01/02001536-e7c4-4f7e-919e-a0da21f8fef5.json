He now has four goals from his last five shots on target. HOME DEBUT OF THE DAY Daniel Sturridge's goal against Norwich made him the first player since Ray Kennedy in 1974 to score in each of his first three Liverpool games. GOAL OF THE DAY Jonathan de Guzman scored twice against Stoke but it was his first, a delicious free-kick from 25 yards, that stands out. BAD DECISION OF THE DAY QPR's Clint Hill nailed Marouane Chamakh with a Six Nations-style tackle in the box. Howard Webb saw nothing wrong and waved the appeals away. BEST PERSONAL TRIUMPH Michael Owen: rolling back the years, sort of, by nodding home a late consolation for Stoke. The goal makes him only the eighth player to score 150 Premier League goals. NAUGHTIEST FANS OF THE DAY Brentford: causing a delay to the second half by pelting Tranmere's goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams with snowballs, PLUS: ANSWERED QUESTION? How to pronounce Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my's first name? Say \"like\" with a Brummie accent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
