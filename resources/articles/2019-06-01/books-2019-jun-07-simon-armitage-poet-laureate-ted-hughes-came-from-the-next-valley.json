I knew it was short, so that was appealing,\u201d he confesses when we meet at the London offices of Faber, which has published his work for more than 25 years and where his books \u2013 28 in all \u2013 take up a couple of shelves on an impressively appointed bookcase. His teacher selected six poems to put on the wall; Armitage\u2019s wasn\u2019t among them. \u201cWhat particularly upset me was that for the first time, maybe ever with a bit of writing, I\u2019d actually put some effort in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I was quite pleased with the thing I\u2019d made. So not to be among the chosen was a setback.\u201d Sometimes he wonders if he has been pursuing a \u201ccareer of revenge\u201d ever since. On 10 May Armitage succeeded Carol Ann Duffy to become the 21st poet laureate: as he jokes each time he finishes a poem, \u201cStick that on your board, mister!\u201d The official call from No 10 kept being delayed \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s quite busy, apparently\u201d \u2013 but after Theresa May had congratulated him and outlined the job requirements (there aren\u2019t any), they had a chat about geography (in which they are both graduates: May from Oxford, Armitage from Portsmouth Poly). \u201cFive minutes and that was it.\u201d His parents cried when he rang them to tell them the news. \u201cThey\u2019ve wanted it for a long time,\u201d he says, recalling the moment in the early 90s when he told them he was giving up his job as a probation officer to concentrate on poetry. \u201cThere were a lot of unknowns. So it was great to go back to them and say it sort of worked out,\u201d he adds with endearing understatement. He and his wife, radio producer Sue Roberts, celebrated with a bottle of champagne and a jump on their daughter\u2019s trampoline in the back garden of their home \u2013 Emmeline, a prize-winning slam poet, is now in her first year at university \u2013 a few miles from the village of Marsden where he grew up and his parents still live. Every so often, he is struck by the realisation that he has followed in the massive footprints of his hero, fellow Yorkshireman Ted Hughes, who was poet laureate until his death in 1998. \u201cHis poetry woke me up, not just to poetry, but fundamentally,\u201d he says. \u201cHe came from the next valley. The house where he grew up looks almost identical to the house I grew up in.\u201d When Armitage started writing in his early 20s the idea that he might get published was a \u201cfantasy. I had no literary pedigree. Poetry still felt like quite a closed establishment.\u201d But, he reflects, \u201cI suppose I always thought, if he can do that from there, why can\u2019t I do it from here?\u201d The departing professor of poetry at Oxford University, Armitage has already won pretty much every poetic laurel going, and last year won the Queen\u2019s gold medal. He collected the award last month in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, where the winner is traditionally introduced to the Queen by the poet laureate \u2013 in this case, himself. \u201cHere he is and here I am,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame really because I would have liked Carol Ann to be able to do that.\u201d The search for a new poet laureate can be a fraught affair. In 1999 Tony Blair reportedly thought Duffy too controversial a choice and recommended Andrew Motion instead. Today, with record poetry sales, the rise of performance poetry, \u201cInstapoets\u201d and a new generation including Kate Tempest, Hollie McNish and Rupi Kaur making \u201cpoetry cool again\u201d, Armitage\u2019s appointment was met with questions as to whether, in 2019, the top job should go to a middle-aged white man. (Imtiaz Dharker, who calls herself a \u201cPakistani Scottish Calvinist Muslim\u201d, was tipped to become the second female laureate, but took herself out of the running last month.) \u201cI just hope that I won\u2019t be judged on my identity, but on my values and what I bring to those issues,\u201d Armitage says. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good track record on that front.\u201d In many ways his wide-ranging writing life has been \u201ca 30-year apprenticeship to this moment\u201d, as demonstrated in a new collection, Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic, made up of poems written as either commissions or collaborations. He is looking forward to being able \u201cto lend a voice\u201d to the exhilarating changes in a genre that \u201ceven 10 years ago still looked like a relatively mono-cultural experience\u201d. Although \u201cthese are really exciting times\u201d, he cautions against complacency. \u201cIf you talk to people from diverse or disadvantaged backgrounds they will still say they feel under-represented, under-served, under-recognised.\u201d Despite having been a high-profile fixture of the poetry scene for the last three decades, he is still keen to stress his northern, outsider status. \u201cKeep your distance London\u201d, he wrote in a 2014 letter addressed to the capital. \u201cIt probably helps living up there in terms of an attitude,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are operating from the margin or outside the centre.\u201d The morning we meet he had taken a train from Wakefield to King\u2019s Cross, and \u201cwalked across London utterly incognito\u201d. There\u2019s something about poetry \u201cwhich is about leading from the back\u201d, he says. \u201cYou can still operate under cover.\u201d As his friend and fellow poet Glyn Maxwell remarked: \u201cBeing famous and being a famous poet are two completely different things.\u201d The title poem in his first collection, Zoom!, which launched his career in 1989, zooms from a terraced house to a \u201cneighbouring galaxy\u201d before plummeting back down to a supermarket check-out queue \u2013 a blueprint for Armitage\u2019s knack of focusing on the mundane (spark plugs, say) while reaching for the stars (most obviously in his 1997 collection CloudCuckooLand). His wit, grit and gift for mixing the demotic with the metaphorical have long made him the people\u2019s poet, whose \u201cno brow\u201d (his description) work spoke to the Britpop-New Labour moment. But the young poet who wrote in \u201cGoalkeeper with a Cigarette\u201d that he had \u201cno highfalutin song / to sing, no neat message for the nation\u201d has now become his country\u2019s team captain. Today, he describes himself as \u201cprompt, diligent and fearful of missing deadlines\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the \u201cmad, bad and dangerous to know\u201d writer of Romantic tradition. But at 56, with his trademark earring and floppy fringe (\u201cMy father thought it bloody queer, / the day I rolled home with a ring of silver in my ear / half hidden by a mop of hair\u201d), he says he still feels like the \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d. An \u201cobsessive\u201d Smiths fan, he used to sing in a band called the Scaremongers, and has just finished an album with his new \u201censemble\u201d, the Land Yacht Regatta, which he describes as \u201cmore spoken word and electronica\u201d. And he\u2019s surely the first poet laureate to moonlight as a DJ. Since his appointment, he has been criticised by some in the poetry community for being \u201ctoo approachable\u201d and by others as \u201ctoo complicated, too highbrow\u201d, he says. The late Irish poet Dennis O\u2019Driscoll sniffily observed in a review in 2000 that Armitage \u201clikes to have it both ways\u201d, he is a \u201cstreetwise poet\u201d, cheekily \u201ctwo-timing Radio 1 and 3\u201d \u2013 but then went on to tip him as \u201ca poet laureate in waiting\u201d. Two decades later, if Armitage has a mission statement it is \u201cto try and keep the middle of poetry in the centre ground. Poetry is already an obscure art form, so if you are an obscure poet within that you\u2019re really obscure, you are operating beyond Pluto.\u201d He once compared his frustrations with \u201cthe smallness\u201d of poetry to \u201ctalking down a toilet\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always get the audience and the readership that it needs or it wants,\u201d he says now. But he also sees it as the antidote to \u201cthe constant diarrhoea of information\u201d. He wants \u201cpoetry to be able to speak to people who would go to a cinema or a gallery or a museum or a show \u2026 to have a voice in that marketplace.\u201d Few poets have so enthusiastically \u201cgot out from behind the keyboard and the dusty tomes \u2026 to go into the schools, prisons, communities and hospices\u201d, as he wrote in an impassioned op-ed for this paper last autumn, in what now looks rather like a bravura job application. \u201cI\u2019ve never been satisfied with the idea that poetry just lives in books. \u2018Poetry is a go anywhere art form\u2019\u201d, he says, quoting the Australian poet Les Murray, who died in April. Like another laureate, John Betjeman, Armitage is fairly comfortable on TV, but he doesn\u2019t do Twitter (\u201cIt\u2019s just not my thing\u201d), remembering Ted Hughes\u2019s dictum of \u201calways keeping something back\u201d. Most significantly for the new job, he has been unafraid of taking on \u201cmoments of national or collective consciousness\u201d, such as the millennium, the 9/11 attacks and most recently Brexit, in his poem \u201cThe Brink\u201d. \u201cI have chosen to dive into those occasions,\u201d he says of his sense of artistic responsibility to engage with the world. But he\u2019s always \u201ctried to talk about the universal in terms of the particular\u201d, such as the fictional British trader in the north tower of the World Trade Center in \u201cOut of the Blue\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s my modus operandi,\u201d he says. Does a public poet require a new approach? \u201cI can\u2019t change my poetics over night. Big P political poetry rarely works anyway. Poetry is the art of subtlety and to try and meet these subjects head-on isn\u2019t my style. I\u2019m not even sure it is poetry\u2019s style.\u201d How is he going to deal with the expectation to respond to events at the call of news editors rather than the muse? Both Motion and Duffy endured a mixed reception each time they entered the public arena \u2013 a din amplified for Duffy by social media. He would \u201crather have a kicking\u201d for saying \u201cno\u201d than for a bad poem: \u201cI don\u2019t want to give anybody anything that I don\u2019t think is any good.\u201d He is keen to collaborate with other artists \u2013 so maybe a pop song or installation for the next royal baby? Armitage has found the poetic in prisons, porn and Poundland. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in everything\u201d, he says, quoting Murray again, and credits this eclecticism to not having had a formal literary education. He \u201carrived at literature like a kid in the sweetshop\u201d and worked his \u201cown way outwards and backwards\u201d from the then-modern poets he grew up with (he particularly remembers an all-male 1970s anthology called Worlds) in a \u201ckind of retrospective education, all the way back to Homer\u201d. While his reworkings of Homer\u2019s Odyssey and Euripides\u2019s Heracles may seem a world away from his grittier Larkinesque poems, they explore similar questions of masculinity \u2013 \u201cHow can you be a hero in your own home, as a father?\u201d \u2013 that have preoccupied him since his 20s, now that \u201cthose ideas of heroism that you grew up with on TV and in comics are not really viable options any more\u201d. He has also sought to use poetry to express the point of view of \u201cpeople from the margins not properly able to articulate for themselves, or voices that have been lost or taken away\u201d, such as the residents of a Rochdale housing estate in Xanadu (1992) or the murdered teenager Sophie Lancaster in Black Roses (2012). And then there is his nature writing (Hughes\u2019s muddy footprints again), which has seen him take to the hills with his accounts of trekking the Pennine Way (Walking Home, 2012), or physically writing on to the landscape in Stanza Stones (2013). A series of poems on the subject of rainfall, carved into rock faces around Marsden, these stones are \u201cprobably the most satisfying\u201d as well as the most \u201ccomplicated and arduous\u201d of his projects. He is \u201cabsolutely determined\u201d that writing about the environment, \u201cthe issue of our time\u201d, will be at the heart of his 10-year tenure, with a new award (he\u2019s looking for sponsors) for poets responding to the crisis. He also has more concrete poetry ambitions, with dreams of establishing a national centre, \u201ca place that hosts and houses what I think of as these islands greatest art form\u201d, he says. \u201cSo if you know somebody who has got a spare building \u2026\u201d Motion famously grumbled that the laureateship had been \u201cvery, very damaging\u201d for his own work. Is Armitage worried about the curse of the poet laureate? \u201cNo. I can\u2019t help writing poems. I was at home the other day. I got up in the morning thinking: \u2018I\u2019m the poet laureate!\u2019 Two hours later I was writing a poem. I just can\u2019t help it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can only walk around your own house for a few minutes every day thinking \u2018I\u2019m the poet laureate!\u2019 You have to go and do something real, which in my case is writing poems.\u201d \u2022 Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic by Simon Armitage is published by Faber.
