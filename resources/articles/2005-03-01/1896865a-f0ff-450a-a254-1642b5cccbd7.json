More than a million small shareholders in the company, trading from tomorrow as O2, had until last Wednesday to send in forms electing whether to keep their shares or sell them at a special rate. Anyone who failed to meet the deadline was deemed to have chosen the cash alternative and will have their shares sold. Cash has received calls from several readers complaining that forms never arrived, leaving them powerless to exercise their right to elect to keep their shares. MMO2 says it did everything it could to ensure all shareholders received their paperwork in time. In a statement it said: 'MMO2 mailed a copy of the scheme documentation to all addresses on the share register. We cannot guarantee delivery by the postal service, but we established processes to dispatch duplicate forms to those who did not receive them. 'The company allowed the maximum time possible [nearly two months] between dispatch of the documentation in the second week of January and the final return date of 9 March. Throughout the process, MMO2 communicated not only directly with shareholders but also indirectly through both print and broadcast media, where the scheme has been extensively covered. We thank The Observer for bringing individual concerns to our attention. We are working very hard with our helpline to answer any queries.' A spokesman said that any shareholder with a particular issue needs to raise it with the helpline, run by company's registrar, Lloyds TSB. He added: 'An analysis of the call volumes received by the helpline indicates only a very small number relating to non-receipt of forms.' O2 has been frank about its desire to shrink the pool of small shareholders. It wanted to reduce its administration costs ahead of paying its first dividend this year and suggested that posting dividend cheques to the vast shareholder base would cost more than the value of the dividend in many cases. Small shareholders represented 63 per cent of the old share register by number but owned just 3.5 per cent of MMO2. The company sweetened the pill for reluctant sellers by offering free dealing plus a 5p premium on the share price. David Blundell of the UK Shareholders' Association said: 'O2 was trying to get rid of small shareholders for sound business reasons, but was relying on inertia. I think they should have asked shareholders to make the active choice to sell, with those who made no decision allowed to keep their shares. 'I also think the deal for buying them out was a bit mean considering the small number of shares individual investors own. They should have offered a bigger premium on the price and left it to shareholders to actively decide what to do.' Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Bristol-based stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, which encouraged clients not to feel railroaded into selling their shares, said: 'The vast majority of our clients with MMO2 shares have decided to stay put and not take the cash alternative.' Cash rang the helpline to be told that shareholders unhappy with receiving the cash rather than new shares can appeal by writing to Gavin Lane, Lloyds TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, East Sussex, BN99 6DA.
