In a recording leaked to the Washington Post, the US secretary of state was asked what he would do if Corbyn were to be elected as prime minister, after sustained criticism over Labour\u2019s handling of accusations of antisemitism within the party. The questioner said: \u201cWould you be willing to work with us to take on actions if life becomes very difficult for Jews in the UK?\u201d In response, Pompeo appeared to suggest that he would seek to intervene in the debate before Corbyn had a chance to become prime minister. \u201cIt could be that Mr Corbyn manages to run the gauntlet and get elected,\u201d he said on the recording. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. You should know, we won\u2019t wait for him to do those things to begin to push back. We will do our level best. It\u2019s too risky and too important and too hard once it\u2019s already happened.\u201d A Labour spokesman said: \u201cPresident Trump and his officials\u2019 attempts to decide who will be Britain\u2019s next prime minister are an entirely unacceptable interference in the UK\u2019s democracy.\u201d He added that the party was \u201cfully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and is implacably opposed to antisemitism in any form\u201d. Pompeo\u2019s comments emerged after Trump turned down Corbyn\u2019s request for a meeting during his state visit to the UK last week, saying the leader was \u201csomewhat of a negative force\u201d. Corbyn joined protests outside Trump\u2019s press conference with Theresa May, where he pledged to oppose the US president\u2019s drive for greater access for US health companies to NHS contracts. The comments come at a time when Corbyn\u2019s team are nervous about the latest attempts to oust him from within the party over the issues of antisemitism and Brexit, after several senior figures came out in support of a second referendum. Shadow cabinet sources said the leadership was preparing to take on Tom Watson and his supporters after his vocal campaign to soften Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position, with moves under way to generate momentum in favour of a new deputy leadership election. There is growing talk about the possibility of the party\u2019s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Watson, but also the possibility of a new deputy leadership contest altogether. Some Corbyn supporters are circulating motions against Watson around local constituency Labour parties and a grassroots petition against the deputy leader has got about 26,000 signatures so far. One shadow cabinet minister said they believed the leadership wanted to make the shadow cabinet less in favour of a second referendum. As part of this, Corbyn\u2019s team considered swapping Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, with Diane Abbott, the home secretary, over her support for a second referendum and wider foreign policy issues. However, it is understood that Thornberry has more recently been assured that she will not be moved and that Abbott was opposed to such a plan anyway, which would make the move difficult to carry out without a public battle. A Labour source said there were no plans at all for a reshuffle and dismissed speculation about moves within the top team as mischief-making. Talk of a reshuffle was sparked when Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn\u2019s usual stand-in for prime minister\u2019s questions this week after speaking out about Labour\u2019s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was \u201cnot clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear\u201d. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
