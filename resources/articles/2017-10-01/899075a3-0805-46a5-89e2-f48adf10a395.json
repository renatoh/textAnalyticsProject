The Labor MP released a statement on Wednesday saying her 33-year-old son, who had struggled with mental health and addiction, had died in Sydney overnight. \u201cI wish to advise that my beloved son, Binni Kirkbright-Burney was found dead last night at our family home in Sydney,\u201d Burney said in a statement. \u201cThe NSW police advise that there appears to be no suspicious circumstances but the cause of death is yet to be determined. \u201cI returned to Sydney last night to be with him this one last time. Binni is 33 years old. He is a caring and loving man. He has struggled with mental health and with addiction. \u201cHe tried so hard to conquer his demons, as I and my family have tried so hard to support him in every way we could. I don\u2019t want to pre-empt subsequent inquiry but we all thought we were getting somewhere. I don\u2019t know what life will be like without him. \u201cI understand I am a public figure but in this dire, grief-stricken time for me, I ask that you respect my and my family\u2019s privacy in all respects. When I can, I will speak about this.\u201d Burney was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016, winning the federal seat of Barton. She was the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the House. The NSW Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC) has sent its condolences to Burney and her family, with NSWALC chair Roy Ah-See saying the Land Rights network would be in shock today and would be grieving her loss. \u201cOur thoughts are with Linda Burney and her family during this extremely difficult time. \u201cWhen the terrible news broke this morning, I was in Canberra with Aunty Matilda House who also sends her condolences.\u201d Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie in 2015 revealed her own son\u2019s struggle with drug addiction. During a debate about welfare payments, Lambie said her then 21-year-old son was addicted to ice, and she would be opposing the government\u2019s social services legislation amendment bill which would have removed welfare payments for people in psychiatric institutions.
