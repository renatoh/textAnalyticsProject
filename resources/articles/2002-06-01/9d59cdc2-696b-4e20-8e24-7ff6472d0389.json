Can you give us any advice? Rosemary Sturge, Northampton The Latvian National Ballet performs in the Opera House in Riga. For information and ticket sales visit www.lmuza.lv/opera. British Airways flies daily between London Heathrow and Riga in just under three hours (0845 7733377). Accommodation can be quite cheap if you book directly with the hotel. Lonely Planet's Estonia, Latvia &amp; Lithuania has recommendations across all price ranges. Riga is a fascinating city, with fabulous art nouveau architecture, and you'll find plenty to do when you are not at the ballet. The Occupation Museum (open daily 11am -6pm; free) tells the story of the Nazi and Soviet occupations - ask for a guided tour. Also worth visiting is St Peter's Church in the old city (entrance: 1.60Ls; closed Mon). The view from the gothic spire is fantastic. For further information on Riga and the rest of Latvia visit www.latviatourism.lv. Canada via Seattle We are travelling (with three teenagers) to Canada, where we have set up a house exchange in a remote town called Salmon Arm. Because we wanted to see something of the coast, we have booked flights into Seattle, with the intention of staying there for a few days and then making our way to Salmon Arm, probably via Vancouver. However, we cannot find out the relative costs and times of trains, buses or flights. What are our options? Catherine and Mike Scott, by email Salmon Arm (pop. 15,000), in the Okanagan Valley, is about 400 miles from Vancouver - it's just off the Trans-Canada Highway on the shore of the Shuswap Lake. There are a few ways to get there, but costs will very much depend on how long you're staying for. Hiring a car would allow you to take your time and also do some exploring while in Salmon Arm, but is likely to be the most expensive option. For details see www.budget.com and www.holidayautos.com. Flying, it's best to head for Kelowna, a few hours south of Salmon Arm - Horizon Air flies from Seattle, and West Jet from Vancouver. It pays to book ahead, but your children will have to pay full fare. The bus is almost certainly the cheapest option - but you're looking at a long, slow journey from Seattle (10-13 hours) or Vancouver (6-9 hours). There are good discounts available from Greyhound if you book in advance. Contact Tourism British Columbia at 3 Regent St, London SW1Y 4NS or Visit Canada (0906 8715000; premium rates apply). Euro facts I know 'euro' is pronounced differently in each language, but what term do they all use for centime? On arrival in France I used to need a 10-franc piece in Calais for the supermarket trolley. What is the equivalent? The same for coin-op telephones, if there are any left! Malcolm Sowerby, Yarm The terms 'euro' and 'cent' should be universally recognised, even if older terminology persists. In France shopping trolleys generally require one euro and those phone boxes that do take coins will accept a variety of denominations (a phone card is still the best value, however). Walking along the Costa Daurada When in Spain's Costa Daurada we heard of a walking book written in English that detailed both coastal and mountain walks, but can't trace it. Lorrie Marchington, via email There's very little walking information published in English, so no wonder you've had difficulty. The best thing we've found is a hiking brochure produced by the Costa Daurada tourist board. It includes walking trails along the coastal path as well as several mountain routes. Each route is mapped out with estimated timing, and contact details for further information. The stunning photography makes it a great armchair read - and it's absolutely free. Visit www.costadaurada.org or email costadaurada@turisme.altanet.org for details on how to obtain it. For general advice, try Lonely Planet's Walking in Spain (\u00a311.99). \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall and Rachel Suddart from Lonely Planet address as many as possible here. Email travel.tips@observer.co.uk or write to Escape, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. The writer of the week's star letter wins a Lonely Planet guide of their choice (so include a daytime telephone number and postal address). No individual correspondence can be entered into."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
