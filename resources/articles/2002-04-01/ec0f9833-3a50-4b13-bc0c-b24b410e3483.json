Jean Tigana's side have now won only one of their last 10 games and their final five matches have suddenly turned into a relegation run-in. Such was their desperation at the end that even their goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar went up into the West Ham penalty area seeking an equaliser. \"Pass and move. It ain't rocket science,\" someone shouted from the crowd. But too often Fulham approach their task as if it is. \"We seem to have acquired a fragile attitude,\" Fulham's assistant manager Christian Damiano wrote in the programme. And no matter how fervently they sprang forward, the sight of goal seemed to trigger an inevitable recoil. No one suffered more from that affliction than Barry Hayles, who had Fulham's best chance of the game on 10 minutes when David James blocked his close-range shot, and Sylvain Legwinski blasted the follow-up high. For West Ham, winning away for the third time this season, the exertion was less but the effect better; \"a bit dogged\" was how their manager Glenn Roeder put it. While Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 might not enjoy the best fan relations at the moment, it was he who headed in Steve Lomas's cross on half-time. Only Joe Cole came anywhere near a goal after the interval but he sliced his shot high. Fulham had two second-half chances, both headers glanced wide. Jon Harley, of course, had less excuse than Van der Sar. But in general, as Roeder said later, \"They didn't really get behind us.\" Fulham's Jon Harley and Van der Sar both glanced second-half headers wide but, as Roeder said, \"They didn't really get behind us.\" Tigana could have said the same of West Ham. Not even Paolo di Canio, who greeted his substitution with a slow walk to the tunnel, looked like creating anything. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
