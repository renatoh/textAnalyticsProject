The United States is the only industrial nation without a national paid leave law. But the campaign\u2019s leaders are voicing optimism about their chances of changing the situation. With national elections next year, members of Congress are feeling pressure to embrace such a widely popular idea. And the Trump White House \u2013 eager to rack up a family-friendly accomplishment -\u2013 is signaling it wants a paid leave law enacted. A big problem, however, is friction over how to finance paid leave \u2013 Democrats and family groups generally want employers to help finance leave, while Republicans and business generally want workers to shoulder 100% of the cost. Groups in the new campaign include Family Values at Work, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the Center for American Progress, a Better Balance, Moms Rising and several labor unions. Paid Leave for All, the newly formed group spearheading the campaign, has thrown its weight behind the proposed Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (Family Act), which would enable workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for a pregnancy, the birth or adoption of a child, a worker\u2019s own serious illness, or caring for a seriously ill family member. The Family Act would replace 66% of wages, capped at $4,000 a month. It is sponsored in the House by Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, and in the Senate by Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat. Only 19% of workers in the US have access to paid family leave through their employer. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, enacted in 1993, workers can take 12 weeks of unpaid leave, but many don\u2019t use the law\u2019s provisions because they can\u2019t afford to take time off unpaid. \u201cNearly one in four pregnant employees goes back to work within two weeks of giving birth \u2013 this is a scandal\u201d said Ellen Bravo, co-director of Family Values at Work. \u201cThere\u2019s significant evidence showing that paid leave helps women stay employed and increases their pay.\u201d This Thursday, the White House will hold what it calls a \u201csummit on paid leave\u201d. President Trump said in September, \u201cI was the first president to propose nationwide paid family leave in my budget. Very important.\u201d Ivanka Trump, who is spearheading the administration\u2019s effort, said recently, \u201cNever before has this issue had so much support and momentum, on both sides of the aisle.\u201d The White House has signaled it would back whichever proposal has the best chance of advancing. Bravo said the White House summit was designed \u201cto divert attention from this administration\u2019s anti-family policies \u2013 the images of children wrenched from their families, the cuts in food stamps, school lunches and healthcare.\u201d The Family Act would finance leave by having employers and employees each make payroll contributions of 0.2% of an employee\u2019s wages (2 cents for every $10 of wages). Marco Rubio and several other Republican senators have proposed financing parental leave by letting workers take money from their Social Security accounts (and then delaying when those workers receive Social Security benefits by several months). Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, have proposed letting workers take an advance of up to $5,000 from their child tax credit upon the birth or adoption of a child. Senator Sinema said their bill \u201cdoes not increase taxes, creates no new entitlements, includes no new mandates on employers, and does not impact Social Security\u201d. The new paid leave coalition criticize the Rubio and Cassidy-Sinema approaches as hugely inadequate, noting that they apply only to birth and adoption, and not when workers or their loved ones get seriously ill. Dawn Huckelbridge, the director of Paid Leave for All, said: \u201cThese are called paid leave, but they\u2019re not paid leave at all. They\u2019re being paid for by the workers. They\u2019re being taken out of retirement benefits or out of the child tax credit.\u201d \u201cThe occupant of the White House says \u2018I\u2019m the champion of paid leave,\u2019\u201d Bravo added. \u201cWhat he means is not only not paid leave, it leaves out three-quarters of the people who need it and there\u2019s too little money for those who need it.\u201d She said the Cassidy-Sinema plan isn\u2019t paid leave, but a loan. \u201cIt robs Paulette to pay Paulette,\u201d Bravo said. \u201cYou can have some money to take care of a kid, but not when you get cancer or have a heart condition or get hit by a car, and not if a member of your family gets cancer or gets hit by a car and not if your parents have a stroke and need you.\u201d Family advocates are proud that eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted paid leave laws. But the United State Chamber of Commerce is unhappy about the patchwork that has developed. Marc Freedman, the Chamber\u2019s vice-president for workplace policy, says many people are surprised the Chamber supports a nationwide paid leave law, although it wants one financed by employees, not employers. \u201cLike California\u2019s,\u201d Freedman said. He said corporations that \u201care offering these benefits are getting chewed up by the patchwork effects of these state and local regulations\u201d. He voiced concern that the Family Act would still allow a patchwork by letting states adopt more generous leave policies than the national law calls for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
