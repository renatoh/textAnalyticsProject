Our defeat by Argentina was a fine example of that capricious tendency, so the question now is how the French will look on Friday week when they meet Ireland. With no disrespect to the other 19 sides in the World Cup, that's all that most followers of rugby in France will be thinking of and writing about until September 21. What went wrong and what do France do now? It wasn't a matter of over- confidence on Friday. France simply never seemed to get in the game. Ball retention was a huge problem. You can't give up possession at that rate and hope to rival one of the best teams in the world, and Argentina definitely fall into that category. It's worth looking at the opposition, at what they did right, because they were just as nervous. Jo Maso, the France manager, said afterwards that the Pumas didn't do much. I would say, rather, that they did the simple things well. They have a big pack, they were omnipresent at the breakdown, and dominated all the rucks. But they didn't lack individual skill - the 10, 12, 15 axis of Hern\u00e1ndez, Contepomi and Corleto hurt France so much. They kept changing sides, changing the rhythm and kept breaking the French line and playing behind their backs. And I've never seen so many high balls in any match. It was all in the plan though, as Argentina knew they were up against a full-back in C\u00e9dric Heymans who is more used to playing on the wing. The point I'm making is that the Pumas had precise tactics, and they worked. On the other hand, I can't really say what France's tactics or gameplan were. I just didn't understand what they were trying to do, although it's hard to tell whether that's because there were no tactics or simply because they didn't have enough ball to put the gameplan in place. The management have to look at how they approached the match, not merely talk about nerves and tension. France have a tendency to be edgy when they are favourites under Bernard Laporte - at Murrayfield in 2006, at Twickenham this year - and the management should take that into account. Questions need to be asked about the bench and the substitutes as well. Laporte made errors here. Taking off Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez and Fabien Pelous at the same time was a big mistake, as both are experienced players, captain and past captain, both with massive experience, and the team needed at least one of them with the pressure on. Again, not bringing on Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak and Jean-Baptiste Elissalde together was a mistake too: as half-backs they have a different style from David Skrela and Pierre Mignoni. And you can look at the bench: with only two backs, there was little margin for error with injuries, but more to the point, with five forwards waiting to come on, why not use them all in such an attritional game? This was the kind of defeat that can only happen to France, and perhaps only Les Bleus can get back on the rails after such a disastrous start, as we did in 1999. Everyone will expect Michalak to return, as he brings such freshness to the backline, perhaps with Skrela going to centre when he eventually returns. I'm sure the players are capable of picking themselves up, but how will they deal with this result mentally? A psychologist might have some ideas but only the players can answer that question. They need to take matters in their hands, realise that they still have some control over how events unfold. No one is better placed to change their destiny, but there will have to be a good deal of soul-searching and self-criticism, among the management as well as the players. The question now is what happens if the nightmare scenario continues to the end and Argentina win against Ireland. That would mean that first place in Pool D is out of reach and all that is possible is a quarter-final against the All Blacks. In one sense, it's lucky for France that Ireland are in the pool as they can still hope the men in green will save them by defeating Argentina: they will send flowers to the Irish hotel before they face the South Americans - hopefully after first giving Ireland a lesson learned from the Pumas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
