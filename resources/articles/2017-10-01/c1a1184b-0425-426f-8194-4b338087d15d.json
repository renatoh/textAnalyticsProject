Wales, with two matches remaining, are right in the mix for a place at the World Cup finals \u2013 something that has not been said since 1993, when Paul Bodin\u2019s penalty thudded against a crossbar in a qualifier against Romania at the Cardiff Arms Park. From slow starts to false dawns and meaningless matches, the disappointments have been numerous for Wales over the years, which is why Coleman wants his players to relish the make-or-break scenario facing them against Georgia on Friday night and the Republic of Ireland on Monday. The challenge has been made all the harder without Gareth Bale, who misses both games with a calf injury, yet Coleman refused to dwell on that setback. He said the gameplan remains unchanged without their talisman and pointed to the fact Wales have had to line up without one of Bale, Joe Allen or Aaron Ramsey in six of their qualifying matches as evidence they can cope. \u201cThere are no excuses from us,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not woe is me. We\u2019re good enough and we\u2019re in a very good position.\u201d The stakes could not be higher for Wales. They are second in Group D, four points adrift of Serbia, and one ahead of Ireland, with a two-leg play-off next month looking like providing the most realistic path to Russia 2018 for Wales or the Republic of Ireland. \u201cIt is on a knife-edge and we have all been there before,\u201d Coleman said, alluding to the successful qualification campaign for Euro 2016. \u201cWe are in with a great shout and the pressure and spotlight is welcomed by me, I promise you. \u201cAny manager will tell you that you try to stay away from all that. I welcome it. It\u2019s great because I\u2019m always used to \u2018there\u2019s nothing on it\u2019 [fixtures]. We get a couple of good results at the end of the campaign and everybody gets excited and the next campaign \u2018Wallop\u2019 \u2026 after three games we\u2019re out of it. That\u2019s not the case now. It\u2019s the second campaign, we\u2019ve kept the ball rolling and we\u2019re in with a shout. The next game it\u2019s all or nothing and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d With Bale absent, Wales will look to Ramsey for inspiration, just as they did in Serbia in June, when the Arsenal midfielder thrived on the extra responsibility. Ramsey was outstanding that night and will hope to deliver a similar performance in Tbilisi, where he will win his 50th cap. \u201cIf he\u2019s anywhere near his best we\u2019ve got a chance of having a positive result,\u201d said Coleman, who insisted he would have no qualms about starting Liverpool\u2019s Ben Woodburn or Ethan Ampadu of Chelsea, both of whom are 17 years old. Ramsey is one of seven Wales players on a yellow card, which is far from ideal given Wales are in a position where they can ill-afford to lose anyone to suspension for the Ireland game. Coleman, however, is not thinking beyond Georgia and expects his players to do likewise. \u201cIf you are on a yellow and need to take another, so be it. We just have to go and get a performance and a result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go into it thinking about the consequences for other games afterwards. If there\u2019s ever a sign of that from us, we never produce a performance.\u201d It promises to be a tricky assignment. Georgia are ranked 103rd in the world, 90 places below Wales, and were seeded sixth in Group D, yet those facts and figures are a little misleading when it comes to what Coleman and his players will be up against. Ireland were held to a 1-1 draw here last month, when Georgia looked the more accomplished team, and Wales were fortunate to escape with a point from their home game in September last year. \u201cOf all the games in this campaign the one we could have lost was home to Georgia,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very good team. They\u2019ve got imagination, they create chances and they play risk football. That\u2019s very difficult to play against, as we saw in Cardiff, and when the Republic played them. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid of anybody. They\u2019ll take it to anybody. If we have any thoughts of hanging on, then we\u2019ll lose the game. We have to go on the front foot. There\u2019ll be times when we have to defend in numbers \u2013 it\u2019s international football. But when the opportunity presents itself, we have to go for it.\u201d Georgia (4-2-3-1, probable): Makaridze; Kakabadze, Kverkvelia, Kashia, Navalovski; Gvilia, Jigauri; Merebashvili, Kazaishvili, Chanturia; Kvilitaia. Wales (4-3-2-1, probable): Hennessey; Gunter, Chester, A Williams, Davies; Edwards, Ledley, Allen; Ramsey, Lawrence; Vokes.
