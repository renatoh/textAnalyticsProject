I felt under a lot of pressure as a teacher. I joined the profession after my degree in textile design, partly because my dad was a teacher and I felt it was the most obvious career for me, but I also felt it would give me security. At the beginning I loved being a teacher: there was an element of creativity and flexibility to do what you wanted in the classroom as long as the pupils were learning. But towards the end it was more about ticking boxes, paperwork and admin. The creativity was taken out of the job. The tipping point came when I experienced two miscarriages. It all just felt so overwhelming \u2013 I remember trying to get the class through a revision session while I was miscarrying. I knew I needed a break, and I wanted to reconnect with my passion and love for the arts. I spent a lot of time gardening and creating watercolour paintings inspired by nature. I started thinking about taking it more seriously as a career when my daughter, Isla, was born two years ago. I\u2019m only at the start of my career as an artist and designer \u2013 most of my time is spent looking after my little girl. I rely on her nap times to work, which limits me to about five to 10 hours a week. I\u2019ve set up my own brand, Safiyyah Studios, and have released two collections of digitally printed luxury scarves. The latest is inspired by Japanese paintings of blossoms and surreal landscapes. I\u2019ve started taking wholesale orders from boutiques, and I\u2019m excited about attending my first trade show in August. I also work as a textile designer on a freelance basis, creating designs for a baby clothing company. My total annual income comes to about \u00a33,000 a year. I\u2019ll spend about \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 a year reinvesting in the business and buying supplies such as watercolour paints, professional watercolour paper and high-quality brushes. My husband is a GP and partner at his practice. He deals with everything in terms of our mortgage [for our home in Birmingham], which comes to \u00a31,200 a month, and bills. We spend about \u00a3250 a month on food, which he pays for. Our daughter has a handful of allergies such as gluten, dairy, eggs and nuts, which makes it difficult and expensive to buy for her. When I was teaching and on a \u00a327,000 salary, I would contribute towards food shopping, bills and a little of the mortgage, but it\u2019s impossible for me to do that now. I think it\u2019s best for my own well-being that I stay at home and focus on building my career as an artist and designer within a more flexible timeframe. My daughter still needs my attention, and returning to work wouldn\u2019t be practical as we\u2019re hoping to have another child, and some workplaces aren\u2019t accommodating when they know that. While I\u2019m working at home, I want to make the most of the time I have with my daughter and develop my brand before working full-time when the time is right. We\u2019ve scaled back on our holidays since having our daughter. We went a bit crazy before Isla came along. We used to go on big, all-inclusive holidays, visiting destinations such as the Maldives, Bali and Dubai. Due to a lower income, I\u2019ve had to rein in my spending a little. I used to spend about \u00a3200 a month on makeup and clothes \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t think twice if I needed to buy myself anything. Now I tend to think long-term when I buy anything, and think of ways I can upcycle clothes. When I have more money, I\u2019d like to pay for dermal fillers for under my eyes. The sleepless nights have taken over, and I want a little help with that. In the future I\u2019d like to build a studio, converting the garage into a place of work. And when I get to a good enough position with my business, I\u2019d like to buy a property to rent out. But for the moment we\u2019re just focusing on the present."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
