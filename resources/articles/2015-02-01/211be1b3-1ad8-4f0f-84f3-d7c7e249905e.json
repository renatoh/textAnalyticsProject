It will be the Australian improv trio\u2019s 18th, and as is customary, not even the band members know what it will sound like. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be talking about it when we get in the studio,\u201d says drummer Tony Buck with a laugh. Part way through a seven-date Australian tour, he isn\u2019t sharing any insights into the follow-up to their languorous, single-track 2013 LP Open, mainly because he can\u2019t. The band \u2013 whose other members include pianist Chris Abrahams and double bassist Lloyd Swanton \u2013 don\u2019t discuss their music before they make it. \u201cIn general we\u2019ve never had very much to say,\u201d Buck says. \u201cTwenty-nine years ago we talked about what we\u2019d like to explore in this kind of music-making and what it might give us that other projects weren\u2019t fulfilling. Then we got down to playing and finding ways to do it and we haven\u2019t really talked much about it since.\u201d This quiet practice might be familiar collateral to the emotionally tamped Australian male (and perhaps in league with the band\u2019s sixth album \u2013 the soundtrack to the grim 1998 suburban drama, The Boys). But the approach provides fuel. Famously, the band arrive on stage with no preconceived idea of what is about to be played. Formed in Sydney in 1987, the Necks took shape as an outlet free from the relative confines of jazz. Playing at parties, in pubs and, before long, rock clubs, the formally trained musicians teased out a musical language that required them to submit to the unknown. Now recognised internationally for their hallucinatory, immersive soundscapes (or as Swanton recently told ABC radio, \u201cclouds of sound and shimmering textures that pass each other\u201d), Buck says the Necks as they started out had to set aside everything they knew. \u201cSome of the music we first played was about being exciting, or pushing energy or showing people how clever we were. But we were like, \u2018let\u2019s take that out of the equation. Let\u2019s not force anything and just chill. Let the music unfold at its own pace\u2019.\u201d And when they did, the sound grew. \u201cWe used to lock into a kind of traditional way of playing music with piano, bass and drums,\u201d Buck explains. \u201cThe thing that wasn\u2019t traditional is that we didn\u2019t really stick on things for a long period of time. We\u2019d explore the way the instruments blended and how playing something for a longer duration changes it.\u201d While this still happens, says Buck, the trio are also finding more intricate ways of making these connections. \u201cWe\u2019re playing different tempos and different harmonic areas, but it still has this cyclic durational and tamboral blend thing. It\u2019s more abstract and becomes even more psychoacoustic and psychedelic. It gives the things that we\u2019ve always been doing more depth.\u201d Watching the band live is a mystery. As the shut-eyed musicians explore their instruments, entire passages arrive and depart unannounced, as if new sounds are being piped in over the loudspeaker or played by an unseen hand. Time stalls and stretches, and the intensity of incremental moments \u2013 Swanton trading pizzicato for arco; Abrahams exploring a single note \u2013 gets noticed and lost again in an unspooling tapestry of sound. Sets can run to two or three hours. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of it you can have a very different impression of what\u2019s happening than if you\u2019re on the outside looking in,\u201d says Buck. \u201cI\u2019ve played and thought: \u2018Well this sounds weird. It\u2019s not really working.\u2019 And then I\u2019ve listened back to a recording and it\u2019s really interesting.\u201d Relying so heavily on the ability to conjure something from nothing must seed doubt. \u201cSometimes there are sections where it feels like we aren\u2019t creating a unified front,\u201d says Buck. \u201cBut one thing we\u2019ve learned over the years is given time, these things find their own balance. Maybe indirectly you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019ve changed, but you find you adjust to the gravity of the music.\u201d While the band have harnessed a sort of musical telepathy, they have yet to resolve their curiosity. \u201cYou develop a bigger vocabulary and more reference points until those reference points become irrelevant because there\u2019s so many of them,\u201d says Buck. \u201cThat\u2019s the aim as a musician, especially an improvisational musician \u2013 to become free. You increase your vocabulary to the point where you don\u2019t ever have to consider your vocabulary.\u201d Despite the concert halls, accolades and growing heft of the Necks\u2019 legacy, that vocabulary remains utilitarian. One YouTube commenter writes under a clip of the band\u2019s 2003 album, Drive By: \u201cIt helps me to relax when I don\u2019t feel good while grinding poker.\u201d Buck translates the note via a particularly Australian aphorism: \u201cOn one level you can analyse it \u2013 we all know what we\u2019re doing and if someone asks us what we\u2019re specifically, we could talk about it. But it\u2019s really simple. Just play. Don\u2019t push it. And don\u2019t worry.\u201d \u2022 The Necks are currently touring Australia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
