This is part of a much wider trend. From the theft of snowdrops and bluebells to rare orchids and ferns, stealing plants is a problem that goes largely unreported, but it\u2019s a crime that can have disastrous impacts on plant populations. In Victorian days, a mania for ferns saw huge numbers of the plants stripped from the wild, and the numbers of killarney and woodsia ferns have never recovered. The exquisite lady\u2019s slipper orchid was once widely seen across northern England, but collectors wiped it out until only one solitary specimen was left, guarded 24 hours a day when in flower. The summer lady\u2019s tresses orchid went extinct in Britain when the last remaining plants were stolen from the New Forest in 1956. Even widespread thefts of native bluebells have a devastating impact. If this happened to beautiful and rare wildlife there would be a national outcry, but current legislation does not offer plants nearly the same protection as animals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
