The Sixties crooner, who died in 2003 after saying 'Channel Five is all shit', might not recognise it today. For Five, is attempting to compete with BBC4 as British television's most cerebral - the unkind might say abstruse - channel. In what is thought to be a UK broadcasting first, Five is to screen a 45-minute programme in prime time exploring the origins of communism, to be narrated in Russian by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. 'Who'd have thought you could do philosophy at prime time?' said Malcolm Clark, the executive producer. 'The only English is in the narrative links. No voice-over translation - all subtitles.' The Gorbachev programme is one of six TV essays to be presented by heavyweight intellectual presenters in a new series, Big Ideas That Changed The World. 'This type of series seems to have fallen out of fashion in recent years,' said a Five spokesman. In the programmes Archbishop Desmond Tutu explores Christianity, Germaine Greer analyses feminism and Tony Benn traces the origins of democracy. The series's ethos could hardly be further from Five's original philosophy, defined by Dawn Airey, its former chief executive, as 'football, films and fucking'. Shows which sparked controversy include Celebrity Detox Camp, in which pop star turned TV gardener Kim Wilde was filmed undergoing colonic irrigation, The Farm, where David Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos pleasured a pig, and Cosmetic Surgery Live. Question marks hang over whether such a radical change from Five's staple offerings will pull in new types of viewers when the new series starts at 7.15pm on 31 May. But in a dig at Channel 4, which starts a new series of Big Brother the same week, the spokesman said: 'There's a real appetite for programming with depth. We're confident this will offer an alternative to light fare.' However, Clark said the series did not lose sight of Five's core audience. 'The producer had to explain to Germaine Greer that the viewers did not necessarily know what a misogynist is.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
