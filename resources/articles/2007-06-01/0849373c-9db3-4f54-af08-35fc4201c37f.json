The restrained, quiet and considered Ryan Giggs heads into international retirement after this afternoon's Euro 2008 qualifier against the Czech Republic and will be replaced by the emotional, vocal and sometimes controversial Craig Bellamy. The Welsh public will be braced for the storm after the calm. Bellamy's elevation to the captaincy is sure to divide opinion but, having had a week to digest the news, there was a glow about him yesterday which suggested that John Toshack's faith will not be misplaced. Unlike Giggs, his commitment to Wales will certainly never be questioned. \"To have the chance to lead Wales out will live with me forever,\" he said. \"To be given it on a full-time basis is something I'm very fortunate to have; it's something I'm going to look forward to and something I'm going to cherish. \"If you know me and spend time with me, then you know how passionate I am. In Finland [in a qualifying match for Euro 2004] I was struggling with tendonitis and all I wanted to do was come back and play for Wales. There was a big barny going on out there and we had to get solicitor letters as Newcastle did not want me to play. I was adamant that I was fit and I had to get clearance. \"I would love to qualify for a major championship. If I could break the mould it would be brilliant but there have been a lot better players for Wales who have not got to championships.\" For all his optimism about the future, Bellamy is often a prisoner to the past. He captained Wales on a temporary basis last year but it became overshadowed by a looming court appearance. He was subsequently cleared of assault but claims of fall-outs with team-mates have dogged him throughout a career which has already spanned six clubs. In person, Bellamy is far more intelligent, engaging and articulate than is generally perceived, yet there appears to be a reluctance to dwell on any mistakes and a refusal to change. He also indicated that he will continue to go out in Cardiff despite the danger that his fame could make him a target for those seeking aggravation. \"I've been caught up in a lot of stuff which has nothing to do with me,\" he said. \"There is one or two issues I couldn't do anything about. There is nothing I can change. I have to put up with it. \"I'm loyal to my friends and family, I do like to come back [to Cardiff] and that's probably got me in one or two scrapes throughout the years. There are one or two scrapes that you can't do anything about. There has been bigger and better players who have had more to deal with than me. Come on - we are dealing with what we are involved in. It is part and parcel of being a footballer now. \"I've tried [to stay in] but I've got a wife and three kids and they can't get me out the house quick enough - there's only so long my wife can put up with me.\" In Toshack, Bellamy clearly has an ally and there is little doubt that he is something of a role model to younger members of the Wales squad. Cardiff is his home but he always stays at the team hotel in the build-up to the games. He says that he struggles to sleep and is constantly waking team-mates for games of table-tennis. He is known to treat training sessions as seriously as a match. \"When I first played with Mark Hughes I looked at what they were like in training and I could pick up things and watch them in a game,\" he said. \"I still remember those moments - I see the players who come into the squad and I want to put on a display in training and hopefully a performance for them so that they can say, 'yes he is a good player and I can pick up this from him'. That means a lot to me. \"I'm probably vocal throughout - some of it is correct and some of it is incorrect. I try to stay vocal for my own motivation more than geeing up other players.\" There should be no need for any added incentive today. With a seven-point deficit already, Wales must defeat the Czech Republic to maintain a small chance of qualifying for Euro 2008. \"It's massive because if we can win the group is wide open,\" he said. \"We have to win, it is as simple as that. If we don't we are out.\" The departure of Giggs also will ensure that the occasion is tinged with nostalgia and emotion. \"Ryan is a lot better player than I'll ever be,\" said Bellamy. \"He's been the best Welsh player I have ever seen. He's one of those players who has everything. He's not just quick with all the skill, but his football brain is something we are all starting to recognise because maybe he's not as quick as he was. \"I wasn't around for John Charles so I can't get into the debate but I'm a big Ian Rush fan and I grew up watching him. To say that Ryan tops him hurts especially with the Man United and Liverpool rivalry so that is probably the best compliment I can give. As a Welsh player he is one of the most passionate I've ever played with. It's been a great privilege not just to watch him but to be part of it. Thank God he has been Welsh.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
