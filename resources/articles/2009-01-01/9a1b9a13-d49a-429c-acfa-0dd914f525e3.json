Unfortunately for the music industry, \"CDs remain the most profitable and common medium for recorded music sales, accounting for nearly 85% of album sales.\" The WSJ says: US album sales including digital downloads fell 14% for the year, while factoring in individual song downloads, sales were off 8.5%. Finally, the story says: Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group remained the biggest player, with 31.5% of the market. Sony Corp.'s Sony BMG Music Entertainment was No. 2, with 25.3%. Both those companies' market shares were roughly equal to their 2007 levels. Warner Music Group Corp. gained more than a percentage point to reach a 21.4% share, while No. 4 EMI Group Ltd., amid numerous financial and operational problems, saw its share of the market fall below 9%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
