Newcastle\u2019s manager has just been asked about the club\u2019s involvement at the heart of a bitter proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and his rueful expression speaks volumes. \u201cAre we surprised?\u201d he says. \u201cGetting involved in geopolitics, it could only happen to Newcastle, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d What has become known as the Gulf cold war represents a key reason why the Premier League has spent the past 11 weeks pondering whether to approve a contentious \u00a3300m Saudi-led takeover set to simultaneously free Newcastle fans from the misery of Mike Ashley\u2019s 13-year ownership and make their club England\u2019s richest. Sources close to the deal believe it is finally near to being sanctioned but while a green light could only delight a majority of Tynesiders it would also leave Bruce and his players in the eye of a public-relations firestorm. Concerns about Saudi Arabia\u2019s grisly human rights record are already swirling on Gallowgate and the installation of a consortium comprising Saudi\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Reuben Brothers and Amanda Staveley would, in the short-term at least, leave Bruce braced for some awkward questions at his virtual media conferences. Given the narrow remit of their owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, it is intellectual property theft \u2013 the illicit streaming of Qatar\u2019s beIN Sports through the illegal beoutQ platform \u2013 which has most vexed the league. Such piracy, allegedly Saudi, has led to lawyers spending almost three months debating semantics. Is there a technical separation between the Saudi government and PIF? Given that Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, is PIF\u2019s chairman, that beIN has a three-year \u00a3500m overseas rights deal with the Premier League and that a recent World Trade Organisation report on the matter condemns the kingdom\u2019s role in piracy, much hinges on such legal considerations. The resultant hiatus has left Newcastle frozen in the middle of a potentially transformative sliding-doors moment. \u201cYou feel a lot of sympathy for the fans \u2013 and everybody concerned,\u201d says Bruce, who has had no communication with Ashley or the consortium. \u201cIt\u2019s dragged on but my staff and I have to perform against Sheffield United at an empty St James\u2019 Park on Sunday and not let the uncertainty become an excuse.\u201d Many outsiders believe a takeover would preface Bruce\u2019s swift departure but that would be desperately unfair on a manager who, against all odds, has steered a limited, goal-shy squad to within touching distance of safety. Although the optimistic side of the 59-year-old harbours hopes of securing the top-10 finish that could yet give those lobbying for Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s return or Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s appointment pause for thought, another part of Bruce is more pessimistic. He privately fears the undermining limbo now paralysing the club could undo much of his good work. The sooner the side\u2019s 35-point tally can become 40, the better for his and Newcastle\u2019s futures. \u201cI\u2019m a fan and always will be,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever\u2019s best for the club is best for me but if there\u2019s going to be a takeover and I can help Newcastle in any way I\u2019d love to stay in charge. It\u2019s a difficult, difficult job. But I hope I can take this great club forward. \u201cWhoever was going to replace Rafa as manager here was going to have a difficult time. I was under no illusions but, whatever the negativity around me, the vast majority of people I bump into in the street have been hugely respectful. They wish me the best.\u201d He hopes to make his own luck by continuing with the shift from Ben\u00edtez\u2019s safety-first back-three to the four-man defence and slightly more expansive passing style he had introduced shortly before lockdown. \u201cIt was time to change,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost our goal threat. A back-four is the way forward. \u201cBut it\u2019s important we can adapt to situations and have one or two formations up our sleeves to switch to. My old Hull team could do that and Tottenham under Pochettino often changed systems. Flexibility isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d Neither is charity. Indeed PIF is not the only party hoping that the generous gift contained in the belly of the Saudi cargo plane that touched down on English soil last Monday will soon be reciprocated by a different type of gesture. As Dominic Raab tweeted his thanks for the hundreds of thousands of NHS-bound medical gowns donated by the Saudi government, the foreign secretary emphasised the powerful ties binding the kingdom and the UK. Maybe, just maybe, that was the moment Newcastle took a significant step towards escaping their current, thoroughly debilitating, state of purgatory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
