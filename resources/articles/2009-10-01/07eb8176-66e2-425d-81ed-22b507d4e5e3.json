Faraj was furious at Fahim's claim that he stripped Portsmouth of its property assets when he sold the Saudi a 90% share in the club this month. In an interview with the London-based Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Alawsat last week Fahim said he retained control of all the land held by the club. \"I kept 100% of the club's real-estate assets and this is something nobody has paid attention to or spoken about,\" said Fahim. \"I am announcing this for the first time that [the real-estate assets] are owned by the Fahim Group. Without doubt the real-estate aspect is important in sports investment.\" With Portsmouth seeking to refinance their debts, which remain at \u00a370m, any negotiations would be made more difficult if the club held no fixed assets as security for new loans. Now, after the Faraj camp made clear to Fahim that it was \"not impressed\" with what he had said, he is claiming he was mistranslated. What Fahim says he meant to say is: \"I have the right to buy Miland Developments (2004) from Sacha [Gaydamak] to work with the club to develop this land for the benefit of the club and the shareholders,\" he added. But Fahim's relationship with the club where he remains non-executive chairman has been seriously damaged by the interview. And as holder of only 10% of the equity in the club, his position is not strong. Ronaldo court in a muddle Cristiano Ronaldo must choose between court and country after arranging a libel trial in the days leading up to Portugal's biggest fixture for years. Ronaldo is suing the Daily Mirror for an article that alleged his then manager at Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, was furious he had been seen dancing without crutches in a nightclub while recuperating from an injury. The case is listed to begin in London on 9 November. If it runs to its expected four-day duration it will clash with preparation for Portugal's World Cup play-off at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina on 14 November. Fifa rules say a \"player shall be released for the period of preparation. If the player is called up to play in a qualifying match for an international competition, this period shall be four days.\" Were Ronaldo, below, required to provide evidence in person and submit to cross-examination, he would be unavailable for the training camp. What to do? Locog cashes in London 2012 has signed a \u00a320m deal for Thomas Cook to become its official travel supplier. The contract will see the travel operator provide ticket-and-travel packages for fans in Games time. But interestingly for Locog is how the payment is structured: it will receive all \u00a320m in cash where previous deals have had a value-in-kind element. McCarthy huffs and puffs Clearly the manager-player thing is still a touchy subject for Mick McCarthy. The man who fell out with Roy Keane so spectacularly as Republic of Ireland manager that the then Manchester United captain was sent home from the World Cup, has had a bit of a huff himself. News that Rafael Ben\u00edtez was in danger of losing the dressing room ahead of last night's Champions League game against Lyon, where McCarthy was once a player, was discussed on Five Live Breakfast yesterday. When the matter was raised, the now Wolves manager said . \"Well I've no comment. I thought I was here to talk about Lyon, not Ben\u00edtez so I'm going to swerve that one.\" While the presenter Shelagh Fogerty apologised and said she wanted to talk in general terms about the relationship between managers and players, McCarthy continued muttering inaudibly before hanging up. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
