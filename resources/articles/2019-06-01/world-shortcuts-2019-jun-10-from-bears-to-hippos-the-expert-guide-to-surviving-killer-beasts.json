He did, the bear stopped attacking and Andi was helicoptered to hospital where rods were screwed into his broken leg. He survived, but was punching back the right thing to do? \u201cIf you\u2019re being mauled by a bear, you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do, to escape and survive,\u201d says Levison Wood. A former soldier, explorer and writer (his book for kids, Incredible Journeys, is published this week), Wood once had an encounter in a car park in Yosemite when a bear smashed into the adjacent empty car to get food. \u201cWe woke up and made a lot of noise, as bears do try to avoid humans. But each animal is different; you\u2019ve got to know your stuff.\u201d Here\u2019s his guide to fighting off some of nature\u2019s most-feared beasts. Crocodiles Wood knows some stuff about crocodiles, having avoided them while walking the length of the Nile. And that is his advice: avoid them. \u201cIf you go to get water at a place where animals drink, there might be crocodiles there that have been waiting there for days and you might be done for,\u201d he says. \u201cBe a bit clever: go to a less obvious place for water, where they wouldn\u2019t wait for prey.\u201d Hippos One of the biggest killers in Africa, because they are so fast and very territorial. What should you do? \u201cRun as fast as you can, try to get on to some high ground.\u201d When Wood was chased by a hippo, he scrambled up a hill. \u201cThey\u2019re not good with hills, thankfully.\u201d Snakes Make noise, says Wood, and they will avoid you. Unless it is a fer-de-lance, or bothrops asper, a nasty pit viper found in Central and South America. \u201cThey\u2019re the only snake to go out of their way to come after you; they\u2019re very territorial.\u201d On a trip in the Panamanian jungle, one went for Wood\u2019s guide, who was, luckily, wearing baggy tracksuit bottoms so the snake\u2019s fangs didn\u2019t get into his flesh. Big cats These will often come at you from behind, says Wood. You could do what they do in parts of Bangladesh, \u201cwhere the local workers wear masks on the back of their heads, to stop leopards and tigers attacking them.\u201d Sharks One of Wood\u2019s biggest fears, thanks to his grandfather who made him watch Jaws when he was about 10. He has heard that you are supposed to punch them on the nose. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure what state of mind you have to be in to literally get it on the nose.\u201d In general Stay calm, act rationally, stick to trails and don\u2019t wander off on your own, as you are much less likely to be attacked if there are more than one of you, he says. Respect the environment you are in. \u201cMost of the animals we\u2019ve spoken about are critically endangered. While the fear is bred into us, remember that they\u2019re the ones that are endangered, we generally come off better than they do.\u201d Yes, Bauer is OK. But what about the poor bear wandering the Carpathian mountains with a sore head?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
