But for many comedy fans, watching wannabe comics trying to win their own DVD release was one of the guiltiest pleasures of the summer. The eventual winner was the Irish-Iranian Patrick Monahan, a regular performer on the London circuit for years. You certainly wouldn't begrudge Monahan the break; he's always been highly entertaining, with an engaging, freewheeling style. Forget rigorously honed material: Monahan is a scattergun presence who specialises in wild, often crowd-fuelled digressions. While this means he can be hit and miss, an on-song Monahan is compelling. The challenge for him now is to turn that reality show moment in the sun into a lasting career.

Although he's a favourite with big names including Russell Brand and Noel Fielding, he never seems to get the recognition he deserves in his own right. Perhaps that's partly down to his determination to plough his own weirdly shaped furrow. If you go to a Foot show, you're likely to get an evening of gloriously meandering entertainment that flirts (outrageously) with genius, disappears occasionally up its own bottom, but generally delivers big (if sometimes bewildered) laughs. Like many great original performers, Foot exists in his own fully realised comedy world: a world of bizarre social rules, weirdly anachronistic attitudes, and never-ending \"sex sessions\". In some ways, it's no surprise that this endearingly offbeat shtick hasn't been a passport to mainstream fame; still, it has helped Foot command a sizable cult following.

This Canadian comic is a proper off-the-wall surrealist, cut from the same cloth as Vic and Bob. Like them, he loves silly voices, coming up with weird (often animal-based) imagery and indulging in deliberately bad jokes. It all makes for exhilarating stuff, especially when you take into account his hyperactive, hollering delivery. There's also a more knowing side to Law, shown in the way he constantly analyses his own performance onstage. As with his occasional collaborator Stewart Lee, the self-criticism is as amusing as the rest of the material.
