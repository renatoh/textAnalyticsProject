Seated on a cushion, dressed in a black shawl, she sells mattresses in the baking heat amid stalls offering everything from mobile phones and bathroom fittings to electric stun guns and firearms. She won't give her name, or the country she comes from, but knows where she wants to go: Italy. \"My three children are there already,\" she says. \"But I can't find a boat.\" Libya's post-revolutionary chaos has made it the key route for migrants moving to Europe from a broad swath of Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Eritrea and Somalia in the east. It is a precarious and dangerous route, taking them north through Niger, Chad and Sudan across a border that is there in name only in the midst of the Sahara. From there, they endure a 1,000-mile journey through bandit-infested territory to Libya's coast. Those routes have now become battlegrounds for competing smuggling gangs, well armed from a country awash in weapons left over from the revolution that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Once they reach the Mediterranean, the lucky ones are shepherded to a beach rendezvous with a smuggling boat. Even then, there is a precarious trip to the island of Lampedusa, a trip that last week claimed the lives of at least 200 migrants off the Italian coast. Many never get that far: like the mattress-seller, they are dumped in one of Libya's coastal cities and left to fend for themselves, often at the mercy of their smugglers. \"A combination of continued civil unrest, disrupted shipping lanes and European coastal patrols have resulted in trafficked persons remaining in Libya,\" says the US state department's Trafficking in Persons report. \"These networks use a variety of techniques to hold people in conditions of forced labour and forced prostitution.\" The mattress-seller makes a few pounds a day in the market, and counts herself among the lucky ones; in contrast, thousands more have been scooped up by the Libyan authorities and held in detention centres, which are packed to beyond their normal capacity. In one centre in Zlitan, Amnesty International found migrants from Eritrea and Somalia who had been held in cells for six months without access to the centre's courtyard. \"They were in overcrowded cells without sunshine or access to fresh air,\" said Amnesty official Magda Mughrabi. \"We have cases of women strip-searched by male guards; we've documented many cases in which the treatment amounts to torture.\" Amnesty says Libya has yet to sign the UN convention on refugees, meaning it does not recognise genuine asylum applicants, instead holding them indefinitely as illegal immigrants. The International Office for Migration, an intergovernmental organisation, said it could assist Libya. \"This is a huge problem; what do you do with these people?\" said IOM spokesman Chris Lom. \"If the Libyans asked to help us build their migration capacity-building we would do it, but the Libyans would have to ask us.\" Immigrations gangs around Sabah are divided between often bitterly opposing Tuareg, Tobu and Arab tribes. They fight brutal battles for control of the smuggling routes. Under the regime of Gaddafi, border controls were tight, slowing the flow of immigrants. But since the revolution, those controls have lapsed. People and drugs are being smuggled into the country, while weapons are taken the other way. The big concern for western diplomats is that jihadists are using the same routes to move between Libya, Algeria and Mali. The US has opened a drone base in Niger to carry out unmanned flights over the vast empty desert region to augment Libya's efforts. Tripoli's government is itself overwhelmed with the problems of a country suffering political chaos, militia violence and fragmentation. It insists that it provides food and accommodation for all refugees. This is scant comfort for the mattress-seller. She says she is aware of the perils of the sea journey to Europe but is determined to make it. \"I've been all around Libya, to Tobruk and Benghazi searching for a boat; reaching Italy is my dream.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
