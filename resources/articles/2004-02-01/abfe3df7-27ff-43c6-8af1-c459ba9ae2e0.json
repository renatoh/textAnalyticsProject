Both companies claim they are ready to launch high speed mobile data services - in fact Vodafone already has a data card for laptops in the market - but they do not believe that there will be widespread availability of handsets until the end of the year. Speaking to delegates this morning, Vodafone's chief executive, Arun Sarin, admitted that three to four years ago the wireless world could not get enough of 3G and hyped the technology beyond what the technicians at the time could actually get it to do. This cannot be allowed to happen again, which is why the company is unlikely to launch a full scale service until the end of the year. \"When we say we are going to deliver certain products and services, we must deliver those products and services,\" he said. \"Our industry I know is all about talking, it's not about talk.\" Speaking at a press briefing T-Mobile's chief executive, Rene Obermann, characterised the race to 3G as \"the battle for the next generation of mobile\". But unlike Vodafone, which sees 3G as a stand-alone service that will roam onto existing network technology where 3G coverage does not exist, T-Mobile intends to offer a service that will use wi-fi technology as well as 3G for heavy data users. T-Mobile has 4,000 wi-fi hotspots in Europe and the US and intends to have 10,000 by the end of this year. \"We are ready to go but we will not go 3G alone,\" he said. The company expects to have handsets that can use existing network technology and 3G and wi-fi by the end of the year. Yesterday Nokia said that its new communicator will have such capability by Christmas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
