The practice has been highlighted by the leak of an email from Jo Moore, the special adviser to the transport secretary, Stephen Byers, suggesting the September 11 terrorist attack represented a good day to bury bad news. The leak raised the question of what other unhelpful news the government machine has been quietly disgorging while all eyes are on the building conflict. The government media handlers, using a meticulously constructed weekly grid, manage the flow of news, rationing announcements so that they do not clash with one another, or other big events, ranging from the Eurovision song contest to a G7 summit. If government is not to slide into paralysis, some bad, as well as good, news decisions have to be made, and announced. On occasions, this can be a genuine source of frustration for ministers. The home secretary, David Blunkett, for instance, nearly delayed the publication of his book setting out his political philosophy. Once published, it received virtually no publicity. Other ministers held back from making the usual good news announcements at the party conference. In assessing the degree of manipulation since September 11, the test is whether the announcement had to be made, or had been deferred in the hope of being drowned out by the din of war: Transport and local government Ms Moore's initial memo on councillors' expenses covered an obscure consultation document suggesting that executive councillors, as opposed to ordinary councillors, should be given expenses. Liberal Democrats claim it also contains plans to break a legislative commitment to let councils decide whether to grant pension rights for all councillors. Some suggest Mr Byers timed the weekend bankruptcy of Railtrack to clash with the start of the bombing of Afghanistan. This seems far fetched. Mr Byers classified the news as good, and had planned to make the announcement on Monday, the start of the conference of the Conservative party, creators of the ill-loved private rail firm. The news leaked in a vague form in the Financial Times on Saturday, forcing the decision to be announced the same day. No bombing decision was conveyed to Downing Street until Saturday afternoon. The Railtrack decision had been in the making for a month, and Railtrack's financial crisis meant the decision could be deferred no longer. Home Office David Blunkett has largely been occupied with the security crisis, and tightening the law on extradition. On September 19, he disclosed that the asylum backlog was twice as high as had previously been admitted - 43,000 instead of 20,000. Mr Blunkett apparently delayed the announcement a week to avoid accusations of news management. His failure to reform asylum vouchers would have received more coverage at the Labour party conference, but for the war. Instead the Home Office highlighted positive plans to introduce a green card. On October 8 the much delayed Auld committee report into the courts was published to mixed reviews. The report had been with ministers for a month and the timetable appeared unaffected by September 11. Environment, food and rural affairs On October 3, after a titanic internal Whitehall battle, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, gave the go-ahead to the MOX plutonium fuel plant at Sellafield, Cumbria. The announcement was long due following a public consultation. Once September 11 occurred and risks of fresh terrorist attacks grew, ministers delayed, fearing it might provoke fears about nuclear terrorism. On September 28, the environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, published the ministry's response to the BSE inquiry, offering extra compensation to victims. The story, one worth promoting for the government, received virtually no publicity. The public inquiry into foot and mouth virus has begun with little accompanying news coverage. Health Little published save controversial NHS trust league performance tables (September 25). Harefield hospital closed on October 8, but this had been long expected. Cabinet Office On September 18, an annual publication showed wage equality for women as far away as ever. Weekly median gross individual income for all women in 1999/00 was \u00a3125, slightly less than half of that for all men (\u00a3256). There is little sign that this was subject to manipulation. Social security On September 19 the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, published the third annual report on the government fight against poverty showing steady, but slow, progress. The report was long in the pipeline, but might have provoked a debate on equality. On October 9, the government published long expected plans to remove benefits from community service absconders. On September 27, a report showing low take up of minimum income guarantee was published and could have provoked anger over means tested benefits. The day before, Mr Darling tabled a government motion requiring incapacity benefit claimants to attend a work place interview every three years. Little attempt was made to advertise this move. Education and skills No formal announcement, but leaks from the higher education minister, Margaret Hodge, at the party conference confirmed Guardian reports that ministers are considering a graduate tax to replace the current unpopular system On September 12, the government announced that AS-level students will take shorter examinations next year following streams of complaints from schools this summer. This was not something the government had been keen to discuss before. On September 22, David Hargreaves, the chief executive of the qualifications and curriculum authority, quit after one year, saying it was time for a younger person to take over. Culture, media and sport On October 4, a long-awaited independent government report by Patrick Carter rejected plans to proceed with a national athletics centre for the 2005 World Athletics Championships at Pickett's Lock in Enfield, north London. The report had twice been delayed, and there was pressure in the sports world for a decision to to lift the uncertainty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
