The name was not applied to Cardinal Richelieu himself but to his close friend, adviser and diplomatic agent, the Capuchin friar P\u00e8re Joseph (born Fran\u00e7ois Joseph du Tremblay). \"How did he get here?\" hissed a young journalist, suddenly spotting Alastair John Campbell sitting on a chair at the side of court 73. \"He just materialised\". Perhaps one of the 12 empty MFI beech veneer bookcases that line the room had indeed silently revolved allowing the master of manipulation to slip in unseen. Or perhaps he'd just walked the few yards from the door when the young journalist wasn't looking. Here he was, the second power in the land, the PM's \u00e9minence grise, the British Richelieu, waiting his turn to be grilled in public. Nothing quite like it had ever been seen in these isles before. In the gallery, a mixture of hacks, Tory front-benchers with nothing better to do and incredulous members of the public congratulated themselves on being there and helping to make history. Before the judge arrived Alastair John moved to his place in the witness box, with its personal computer screen and microphone with a lit-up red tip. Sitting at 90 degrees to the rest of us, AC was in full profile, and you could see what a contrast he is to his arch-enemy, Gilligan of the BBC. Where Gilligan was all uninviting curves, Campbell was made up entirely of angles. The widow's peak of his hair, the vertical of his forehead, the long downward sweep of the nose, the set of the jaw, the long, equal lines running from nostril to chin, the cheekbones, the position of the hands and elbows, all as though some great didactic power was using him to illustrate advanced geometry. But the Hutton inquiry isn't the kind of thing that \u00e9minences grises and powers behind thrones are used to. For a start, their private messages aren't usually displayed on large screens, or anywhere else. How would Richelieu have fared, faced with something like, \"To: Milady, From: CR, cc: Jonathan Parvelle, Subject: Discrediting Queen. Agree re diamond tags idea. Suggest cut off two for surprise presentation HM. Authorise 200 pistoles re expenses (accommodation, assassins, ambushes etc.)\"? The inquiry's own top lawyer, Mr Dingemans - his pin-striped back turned to us and maintaining a heroic standing position behind his little lectern for hours - had the Campbell diary and asked questions based on its entries. Mr Campbell had the diary and answered them. We alone did not have the diaries, so we couldn't see whether he also recorded what he'd had for lunch, when he practised the bag-pipes and what he really thought of George Bush. What we did discover, as Campbell answered questions, in his own chalk-lined voice (emphatically not the ridiculous \"I will kill you now, Mr Bond\" one given to him by the BBC PM programme yesterday), was just how much stuff there was going around. He was continually being pestered by messages from flunkeys acting \"beyond their pay grades\", volunteering unwanted suggestions about dossiers and WMDs, and usually stating the bleeding obvious. \"I receive an awful lot of emails,\" said Campbell, \"that I don't read.\" You could see why. He'd get a message from Tim Dim, copied to Brian Brown. \"Who is Tim Dim?\" Mr Dingemans asked at one point. \"He was at the cabinet office but he's gone to defence,\" answered Campbell. \"And who's Brian Brown?\" \"He was at the cabinet office, but he's gone to defence\", came the reply. No wonder it's a bit chaotic. And phone calls. They arrived for him when he was on holiday, when he was in the bath, in Kuwait, in New York at a funeral (\"sorry, I must just get this\"), at Wimbledon with his son. And all of them, for months, were about Andrew Gilligan, the Moriarty of the BBC. But how had the man of power become so obsessed with this one journalist that we had all eventually ended up here, enjoying ourselves so enormously (whatever the sombre occasion for our presence)? Well, he revealed, he'd tried everything in his repertoire with the BBC, from soft bullying, through medium bullying to hard bullying. And none of it had worked. It was frustrating and infuriating, he said, \"that an allegation can be made by the foremost broadcasting organisation in the country, and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\" Had the gallery been made up of less cynical people, there would have been tears. And that was the point really. Because it was difficult to know, as it has been all through this business, who the powerful people really were - the man in the box speaking, or the folk with the notebooks deciding which words to report and what the story was going to be. And hard to tell whether this new Hutton way of doing business, out in the open, might not ultimately diminish the power of both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
