In December 2001 the House of Lords re-imposed a \u00a326.5m surcharge on Dame Shirley for her attempt to gain political support in the 1980s by selling off council residences in marginal wards to potential Tory voters. Dame Shirley - a Tesco heiress - has challenged that ruling and claimed that she does not have enough money to pay Westminster council the cash. Today the high court ruled that an order to freeze Dame Shirley's assets should be widened to include any trusts, nominee companies or similar arrangements that she has set up to manage her funds. Dame Shirley, the leader of the council between 1983 and 1991, was also ordered to provide full details of any transactions worth over \u00a3100,000 made since January 1 1994. Mr Justice Lightman ruled that Dame Shirley should disclose by next Tuesday any other assets that she has the power directly or indirectly to dispose of. He increased the upper limit on her frozen assets from \u00a333m to \u00a337m to take account of back dated interest. In addition, Westminster council was awarded \u00a320,000 in legal costs. The move comes after Dame Shirley claimed that she had assets worth only \u00a3300,000. Campaigners have called for any recovered funds to be spent on increasing the supply of affordable residences in the Westminster district. However, they fear that Dame Shirley has placed her funds beyond reach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
