She was the best in the country and, had she run one second quicker in the final event, the 800 metres, the extra 15 points would have brought her silver. There were tears about it at the time after a public dressing down from her coach Charles van Commenee and there remain regrets that she did not make it to the higher level of the podium. Sotherton says now that she is a more professional athlete and a brief insight into her life shows why. Never mind the fact that she sets her own training programme after Van Commenee left Britain for a job in Holland; Sotherton has arrived here in Finland for the world championships which start in Helsinki on Saturday having prepared with the added stress of worrying about her sick mother, who had part of her right leg amputated. The 28-year-old Sotherton is one of Britain's best medal hopes for the championships, which are returning to the Finnish capital 22 years after the city staged the inaugural event. Since finishing third behind Carolina Kluft in Athens, Sotherton has narrowed the position and points gap between herself and the Swede. She came second to Kluft in Gotzis in Austria in May - a month after her mother Yvonne, 50, had the first of her two operations. Sotherton has always been close to her mother, who brought her up alone on the Isle of Wight and was the person who persuaded her to give up her job as a telephone banking debt collector to concentrate on being a full-time athlete. Her mother suffers from lupus disease, an illness that affects the immune system, and after her right foot became infected she was advised by doctors to have her leg amputated below the knee. \"It has been very stressful,\" said Sotherton yesterday. \"I worry about her a lot and it hasn't helped things with me. She cannot even come out to Helsinki as she has just had another operation. \"She has always had a warrior spirit and she says that the hardest thing is not watching me compete. I have joked that she could start training and make the Paralympics in 2012. \"The family help at home. She is on the mend now. She was operated on first in April and then last week. For her it has been a major life change and very traumatic for us all.\" However Sotherton is dealing with it privately, she remains consummately dedicated to her task here. With her event on the opening weekend Sotherton has been one of the early British arrivals at their preparation camp in Turku. Twelve months on from Athens, Sotherton has learned much and never more than in the past few weeks. When Van Commenee left in January, she chose to go it alone. She is advised by a number of technical experts in the seven events that make up the heptathlon but she remains the one who puts the whole plan together. It has not always worked. \"I have fretted this year because I did not think I was fit enough and because of that I trained too hard,\" she said. \"The last 10 days I have rested and now I have had the best week of training in the past six or seven months. \"I had been run down but it is a learning curve. Being the first year by myself without one major coach you have to learn the hard way. I have and hopefully it will pay dividends at the weekend.\" She does not allow herself to think about Kluft or the presence of the former world champion Eunice Barber. \"If I do I'm not thinking about what I need to do,\" said Sotherton. \"A medal would be fantastic, it would mean three championships, three medals [she won the European Indoor pentathlon silver in March behind Kluft]. But I always had that dream that I would perform well. My mum kept on telling me all the time that my day would come - and it has.\" These prophetic words will be all the more significant this weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
