Six games without a win hardly made more sense. Victory at Ipswich last week stopped that rot but defeat here explained a lot. Derby were not really mieux , just plus r\u00e9solu. John Gregory, Villa's manager, was \"devastated\". He had no reason to expect better. His team of talents looked not to know the object of the exercise. It was all party tricks to little purpose, pretty stuff where it does not hurt, executed more in hope than true belief. Gregory said: \"We lacked invention and guile in the last third.\" Lack of care and concentration seemed the root cause - and lack of managerial direction. There was a seasonal case for the Christmas tree formation but both sides went for the holly bush, dense in the middle, with lots of bright bobbles. Villa even had an Angel on top. But the whole was as over-decorated as a paragraph of Colin Todd's programme notes in which the manager said that a 5-0 defeat at Old Trafford \"always takes the wind out of your sails\", Everton was \"a different cup of tea\" but \"we just weren't at the races\" and \"consequently were under the cosh\". To most eyes not much wind had been in Derby's sails, though perhaps to Todd two wins in the four games before Manchester United felt like a breeze; and, apart from two aberrations, he has secured the defence. Goals have been the problem. They had not scored two in a league match for three months, when they lost 3-2 to Leicester. They had not scored three for 15. Todd has raided Europe to reinforce his squad and had only three home players in Saturday's team. Two were at the heart of Derby's victory, Chris Riggott and Danny Higginbotham providing Anglo-Saxon substance in defence. Up front the manager boldly played two and a bit, giving Georgi Kinkladze his first start for three months just behind the Italians Fabrizio Ravanelli and Benito Carbone. \"Get into the game, Kinkladze,\" came a pained cry periodically from the stands. But, with so many loose passes, it was the kind of game that no one was properly in or it was better to be out of. The Italians strove mightily, Carbone against a former club, Ravanelli a revelation of energy. For all that, Gregory said later: \"It was like a library in the first 20 minutes.\" Presumably he was referring to the hush not the order. No goal was threatened until Ravanelli hooked in from a badly marked corner, only for Villa to catch Derby cold in celebration. Ravanelli had barely got his shirt back on when Juan Pablo Angel equalised, brushing off Youl Maw\u00e9n\u00e9. Two moments tilted the game Derby's way, though Gregory said they \"should not hide the truth\". After Hassan Kachloul hit a post Ravanelli lost and won the ball back and set up Carbone's first joyous goal for Derby; once Peter Schmeichel would have cut out the cross. Then Riggott stifled Paul Merson's shot, Derby broke again and the substitute Malcolm Christie made it three. By then Villa were in mistletoe formation, with two at the back. Christie got his kisses as he was caught near halfway. Man of the match: Chris Riggott (Derby County)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
