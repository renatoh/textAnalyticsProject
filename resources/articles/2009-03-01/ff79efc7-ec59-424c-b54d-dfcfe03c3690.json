There, we've said it. They're the new black, the new rock 'n' roll, the new skinny, the new missionary position. They're better than sex, and they're the best thing since sliced bread; that's what we're basically saying. Here's what they told us about this weekend's action. Enjoy, and then have a go at creating your own \u2013 the person behind the best one we see each week will win a signed Premier League shirt of their choice. Fulham outpass Arsenal. Fulham. Outpass. Arsenal The notion of outpassing Arsenal at the Emirates seems absurd, like being balder than Duncan Goodhew or smugger than the NME, but Fulham managed it. They became only the third side, after Manchester United and Liverpool, to play more passes at the Emirates than their hosts this season, and they had a higher pass-completion rate than Arsenal too. Danny Murphy, in particular, enjoyed himself: no fewer than 81 times did he feel the soft kiss of leather boot on leather ball. Ultimately it didn't help Fulham improve upon a laughable record of three goals in 14 away games, but it was in stark and impressive contrast to the feeble manner in which they rolled over at Old Trafford recently. Robinho pulls his finger out. A bit Accusations that Robinho is a homer have grown as the season has progressed, particularly after a recent game at Portsmouth in which he trudged around with all the enthusiasm of a man on the way to the funeral of everybody he has ever known, but he was significantly involved at Upton Park. His total of 45 passes was higher than any other attacking player on the field (by that we mean everybody except the keeper, defenders and holding midfielder) and, if you discount the games at Newcastle and Stoke \u2013 where the opposition had ten men for a long period, so City inevitably had much of the ball \u2013 it was also his highest total away from home since his very first game on the road, at Wigan. What his passing lacked, however, was ambition: none of them were into the penalty area, which contrasts with his most recent home game, against Middlesbrough. Jack Charlton: football visionary Back in the day, Jack Charlton identified the full-back as the most important player on the pitch, pointing out that they had more space in possession than anybody else. Most sniffed and wondered how the humble old full-back could ever be a major player, but as time has gone on they have become an ever more important attacking tool, to the point where many are selected more for their ability going forward than their defensive acumen. Certainly our chalkboards consistently show that full-backs and deep-lying midfielders are the two sets of players who get on the ball the most. At Everton it was the case of the full-backs: the home side's pair of Leighton Baines (64 passes) and Phil Neville (52) sandwiched West Brom's Paul Robinson (57), and all were regular sources of attacking moves. So Jack was right all along. And to think some people thought Terry Phelan was completely useless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
