McGrath will be 37 in three weeks but has proved pivotal to the late-season surge that resulted in Yorkshire's immediate return to Division One being confirmed shortly after 6pm on the penultimate evening by virtue of Kent's defeat by Glamorgan. The former England international is out of contract this winter but remains intent on a 19th season of first-class cricket. His 68 on the third day at Chelmsford helped develop what appears to be an impregnable lead over mid-table Essex and took his Division Two tally of runs to 584 at an average of 48.66. Those statistics, combined with his substantial contributions to home victories over Leicestershire and Gloucestershire, will provide decent bargaining power. \"We said we would postpone things until the end of the season, we have got the Champions League to look forward to and we will sit down and discuss things after that,\" McGrath revealed. \"I have shown there is a bit of life in me yet, so hopefully I will be playing next season. As any cricketer will tell you, you want to prove yourself against the best and at the highest level.\" Events on the final day of the season will determine which of Yorkshire and Derbyshire will claim the \u00a3135,000 Division Two winners' cheque. \"That's what we targeted this week. Derbyshire are in a pretty strong position but with a chance to win the league we will be going all out to do that,\" said McGrath, whose side must better their rivals' result against Hampshire to finish top. The Yorkshire captain, Andrew Gale, whose declaration provided his attack with a minimum 107 overs to dismiss Essex, said: \"After the heartbreak of Twenty20 finals day a few weeks ago, to go up in the Championship is what this season is all about.\" From a position of 44 for three at the start of day three, an advantage of 179, Yorkshire ground down the hosts' attack with their disciplined approach. They added only two runs in the opening half-dozen overs and 66 across the first session. Both Adam Lyth and Azeem Rafiq struck their second half-centuries of the contest, the latter during a 110-run alliance with McGrath, whose top-edged pull to the second delivery of the second new ball provided Graham Napier with a career-best ninth wicket of the contest. Twice previously he had taken eight-wicket match hauls against Surrey on the same ground. Only once the eighth Yorkshire wicket fell did the tempo change \u2013 Rafiq responding to a message delivered to the middle by the 12th man, Oliver Hannon-Dalby, by striking four of his final 11 deliveries to the boundary. The 21-year-old is never away from the action for long and so it was no surprise when he struck with his fourth ball from the Hayes Close end \u2013 Jaik Mickleburgh snapped up at short-leg \u2013 as Essex lost two wickets before the close."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
