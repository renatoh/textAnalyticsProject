Sinckler excelled for the first 55 minutes against Wales, making a staggering 16 first-half tackles, winning the scrum penalty which put England ahead and carrying the fight to Warren Gatland\u2019s side. But two penalties in quick succession amid an ongoing tussle with the Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones saw Eddie Jones withdraw Sinckler just before the hour mark, with Gatland suggesting after the match his ploy to target England\u2019s No 3 \u2013 who he had described as an \u201cemotional time bomb\u201d \u2013 had worked. Sinckler\u2019s apparent loss of composure coincided with Wales seizing the momentum in their 21-13 victory but Mitchell does not want the 24-year-old, who was also involved in flashpoints against Ireland, to lose his fiery edge. \u201cIn this generation of players, you don\u2019t have a lot of players who do [play on the edge],\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cSo he is unique in the way that he does play on the edge and the last thing that we want to do is ever take that away from him because it is something that he can bring to us in a very positive way. \u201cGats won the Test, didn\u2019t he, so he can say what he likes. At the end of the day, most teams are targeting the best players; the great thing is that they see him as one of our best players. In itself, that is a great accolade. So now that he understands he is in that bracket, he can actually use it to his and our advantage. \u201cHe is 24 years of age, an exceptionally gifted athlete as a tighthead; he\u2019s going to be a very good player for England, he already is. As he matures, he is going to be outstanding. He is just going through a process, like any young man, learning and growing in self-awareness. I think we are blessed with an outstanding player. Kyle is a guy with an abundance of talent and all the game is doing now is asking him to contribute to the team, when it really matters, without losing his ability to play on the edge.\u201d Tempers flared again, meanwhile, as Sinckler and co locked horns with Georgia at England\u2019s training camp in Oxford on Thursday. When the two sides took part in a live scrummaging session on Wednesday, a mass brawl erupted, with punches thrown in front of a large group of onlooking schoolchildren. On Thursday, scrums were off the menu but during a high-octane match scenario, a thumping tackle again prompted things to briefly boil over again \u2013 much to the delight of the watching schoolchildren who burst into loud applause. \u201c[Being] put in the heat of the moment and then coming away from it with a clear head and getting a good rugby result out of it \u2013 it has been great for us,\u201d said the England lock George Kruis. \u201cIt is all well thought of by the coaches and they spend hours thinking of the psyche and why and how we do things. \u201cI understand it might be portrayed as a minor thing and guys going at it, but it is well thought-of and calculated and it gives us a chance to go against an opposition we don\u2019t play too much. Chuck some curve balls in and figure it out.\u201d With no scrums taking place, both England and Georgia practised lineouts and mauling as well as their mini-match, in which both sides scored two tries apiece. Maro Itoje did not take part as he continues his rehabilitation from knee ligament damage and neither did Jonny May, who is continuing his return-to-play protocols from a head injury, while Jack Nowell is nursing a minor knock. England are hopeful all three will be available to face Italy on Saturday week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
