In a direct challenge to BBC stars such as presenter Chris Hollins, who have criticised the move, Lewis will say the corporation will be strengthened by employing a \"more diverse talent pool\" and viewing events not solely through a \"London-centric prism\". Detractors, he said, should stop seeing Britain as \"London plus the rest\". The BBC has faced intense criticism over its decision to relocate its Breakfast television programme and Radio 5 Live to MediaCityUK in Salford. Sian Williams, the main presenter of Breakfast, has declined to move north for family reasons. Hollins, the sports presenter and winner of Strictly Come Dancing, has also refused after condemning the move as \"merely a political decision\". In all, 46% of the team working on Breakfast have declined to relocate to Salford, where the programme will be based from April 2012. Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid, the show's other main presenters, are staying with it. Turnbull said the move to Salford would be a challenge though he added that he was \"confident the programme can be as successful in its new home as it has been for the past few years in Television Centre\". Lewis, a Mancunian who is the MP for Bury South, will dismiss the criticisms of the relocation. In an address at the Impact of MediaCity conference in Manchester, he will tell the audience: \"Let me say this to those commentators, celebrities and BBC staff who have railed against the BBC move to Salford and the investment in MediaCity \u2013 shame on you for your outdated prejudices, one-dimensional view of Britain and negativity about the north, which belongs in the dark ages. \"Alongside the NHS, the BBC is one of our great national institutions, one of Britain's greatest achievements. \"It is right that she accepts her responsibility to support the regions, but also the quality of her output will be immensely strengthened by seeking out a more diverse talent pool and range of experiences. If the BBC is to be the authentic voice of Britain it must look like Britain.\" The shadow culture secretary will say that the relocation to Salford will offer economic and cultural benefits and could help to challenge the way in which debates are conducted. He will say that detractors have short memories because they fail to remember the days when Manchester was a major media centre. \"This move should be seen as the 'high speed media link' between north and south, not an opportunity to perpetuate a backward-looking north-south divide,\" Lewis will say. \"The critics should be challenged not only for their prejudice but a small-minded, limiting view of Britain as London plus the rest. Their memories do not stretch to the halcyon days of the Manchester Guardian or the great pioneers who founded Granada TV.\" Monday's speech is designed to show that the north-west of England can play a central role in rebalancing the British economy away from its dependence on financial services. Lewis believes that Britain's creative industries, as the second largest driver of jobs and growth after financial services, will be at the forefront of this rebalancing. He will say: \"We do not want to be the passive, grateful recipients of the proceeds of growth created in London and the south-east. We want to be the wealth creators and innovators playing our full part in steering our country through this difficult time and into a period of new, sustainable growth. \"Britain needs a thriving London and south-east but our country will never fulfil its potential unless we balance the important contribution of our financial services with other key sectors of the economy and ensure all of our regions are firing on all cylinders. That is why recent developments are so important and signpost the many opportunities which lie ahead to support locally produced, high quality content and facilitate the creation of new partnerships with organisations including independent producers, cutting-edge digital companies and universities across the north-west.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
