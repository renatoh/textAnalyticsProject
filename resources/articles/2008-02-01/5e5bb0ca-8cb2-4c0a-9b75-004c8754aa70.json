The board of the Writers Guild of America's west coast branch is making positive noises about a new agreement hammered out by union negotiators and Hollywood studios, reports today's Los Angeles Times. But the board is holding off endorsing the deal wholeheartedly until it sees the final version of the contract. If it does endorse the deal, which it may do as early as this weekend, the strike would be expected to end immediately. The news will bring welcome relief to cinema professionals, thousands of whom have been out of work since the strike began on November 5. It also offers hope that the Oscar ceremony will go ahead at the end of the month as planned, thus avoiding the fate of the cancelled Golden Globes bash last month. Last week, negotiators representing Tinseltown studios and the Writers Guild of America reportedly agreed the outline of a possible deal. Until then, they had been at odds over what level of profits writers should earn when their work is distributed over the internet, via mobile phones and other digital media. They also want to increase their cut from each DVD sold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
