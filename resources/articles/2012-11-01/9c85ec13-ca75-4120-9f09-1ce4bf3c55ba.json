In it, the BBC's director general admitted that the Savile affair was not the BBC's finest hour, not knowing that he was only hours away from watching the programme he once ran \u2013 Newsnight \u2013 being forced into yet another humiliating climbdown. The latest error could not be much more serious for the BBC's journalistic reputation. In simple terms, the BBC linked a public figure to paedophilia \u2013 a claim that was in fact incorrect. But while Entwistle should be out of the picture as regards child sex abuse reporting post-Savile, being personally insulated from this particular crisis is not enough. Somebody now needs to bring steadying leadership to the BBC, but Entwistle, after his disappointing select committee experience, cannot easily take to the airwaves. He lacks authority over a BBC newsroom that is openly speculating whether he can survive the Pollard review into Newsnight's aborted Savile investigation. Nor can he handle questions about the McAlpine error without having to contend with questions and comparisons with Savile. There is already speculation that the isolated Entwistle is feeling the pressure of his job. Insiders say decision-making has ground to a halt, while he and senior colleagues review their evidence to Pollard. Others say he is rarely seen at New Broadcasting House, the new central London HQ, preferring the outpost that is now White City. While Entwistle, some say, is suffering sleepless nights, Lord Patten is not providing much public support, offering only over-the-top phraselogy \u2013 a \"tsunami of filth\" \u2013 to describe the crisis. It used to be said that the BBC Trust, of which Patten is chairman, ended the confusion between regulator and cheerleader by plumping for the former. But as regulator it seems to be failing, and the corporation could badly do with a cheerleader. As for Newsnight, it has become fashionable to speculate that a programme already worryingly dependent on Jeremy Paxman for ratings could be axed. But could Entwistle act with Murdoch-style ruthlessness and axe a show that seems unable to pull off investigative journalism? So far he has proved unable or unwilling to oust an editor whose blog on the axeing of the Savile film needed correcting at least three times. The truth is that programmes tend to outlast directors-general, and Newsnight's only hope is to return to the basics of news analysis. The BBC, too, is remarkably resilient, no matter how it is governed, but Entwistle himself will have to find a way of showing some mettle to dig himself out of the hole. He has to show he can lead the BBC out of this particular crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
