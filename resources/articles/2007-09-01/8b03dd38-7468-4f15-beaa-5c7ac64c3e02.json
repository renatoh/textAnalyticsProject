You're telling me, mate. Nor are they going to be solved, it struck me while reading the foreign secretary's thoughts on the future of the New Labour project, while there is no party explicitly dedicated to standing up for the very poor. \"The second decade of New Labour,\" he continued, \"will deliver a richer, fairer, more confident country than today in the same way Britain is a richer, fairer, more confident country than it was 10 years ago.\" Britain is already quite rich enough, and its richest citizens, as a result, have more than enough confidence to go round. (Well, they do when they're not having a flap outside their local branch of Northern Rock.) Yet Miliband felt compelled to bracket the term \"fairer\" with two superfluous benchmarks because, 10 years and three election victories along, Labour still cannot bear to be seen thwarting the wealthy. It's daft to expect that it might, given that there has never been a party of the truly poor, but it set me thinking what such a party might look like. The annual conference of - let's call it - the Ten Per Cent party (10% being roughly the percentage of the population termed the \"core poor\") would need to be sponsored by Special Brew, for one thing. Nothing like being permanently drunk to take your mind off the fact that, in the last 30 years, you've become increasingly likely to be isolated in areas of concentrated poverty and where your likelihood of being murdered has shot up, while everyone else has been getting \"richer\", \"more confident\", and safer. Its chief spokesperson would have to know what it's like to have avoided most of secondary school without anyone noticing, and to enter adulthood without being able to spell, count, or communicate effectively. They would have to have raised their family in sub-standard accommodation. They'd need to know what it's like to live in an area where they are in constant danger of attack from peers and neighbours. A criminal record, though by no means a universal characteristic of absolute poverty, would confer further authenticity. The poorest tenth of the population hasn't formed a breakaway group of its own accord; the other 90%, represented and led by the three main parties, has run off without it. For as long as the smaller group lacks its own self-generated movement, the rest of us will get away with dismissing the destructive behaviour of the very poor as pathological, rather than caused in great part by a political structure that cannot, or will not, grasp the reality of their circumstances. Labour's new generation of ministers can't afford to pretend that there isn't a link between concentrated wealth and chronic poverty, but Gordon Brown's recent high tea with Thatcher seemed to prove only that he remains preoccupied with wobbly Tories and \"hard-working families\". Yet the number of people who are neither poor nor rich is getting smaller, now comprising 50% of households against 66% in 1980. Many have edged into wealth, and a realm in which public life is made irrelevant through choice, not necessity. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's recent report, Poverty, Wealth and Place, 1968 to 2005, concluded: \"It is important to stress that we are looking at social divides far more important than those reflected merely by income ... Poverty and wealth are fundamentally about being excluded from society or included in it.\" The wealthy and the muddling-along have got all three parties vouching for their concerns and aspirations, while the very poor have no one to bargain for them. I love Miliband's enthusiasm and optimism as much as the next soft-core socialist, but this glaring imbalance in our political landscape is one that neither he, nor Gordon Brown, can continue to ignore. The late subject of Alexander Masters' book, Stuart: A Life Backwards, the drug-addicted, homeless political activist Stuart Shorter, would have made an ideal leader of the Ten Per Cent party, with the acuity and wit to get across the lived experience of extreme, chaotic poverty. He saw council tenants as \"upper-class\", which gives you some idea of the margins in which he operated, and how far there is still to go. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
