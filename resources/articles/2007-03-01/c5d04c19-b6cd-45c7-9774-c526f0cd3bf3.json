Forget March Madness, the FA Cup is still the biggest and best \"bracket\" in the world, and tonight Man Utd and Middlesbrough are vying for the right to play in the first ever final at the new Wembley (with all due respect to Watford, or something equally patronising). Casual onlookers might think United did the hard work by drawing at the Riverside 10 days ago, but Boro have actually been something of a bogey team for the Red Devils in recent years, beating them twice at Old Trafford as well as dishing out the spanking that was the catalyst for Roy Keane's infamous MUTV rant. Don't be surprised if this one goes all the way tonight, which would be Boro's third penalty shoot-out in the Cup already this season. Teams Man Utd Kuszczak, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Heinze, Ronaldo, Carrick, Giggs, Richardson, Smith, Rooney. Subs Heaton, Park, O'Shea, Cathcart, Eagles. Middlesbrough Schwarzer, Xavier, Woodgate, Pogatetz, Taylor, Cattermole, Boateng, Arca, Downing, Yakubu, Viduka. Subs Jones, Rochemback, Huth, Lee, Morrison. Referee M Dean (Wirral) Scrabble champion Kuszczak continues in goal for United, for whom there is a first start up front for Smith since he broke his leg at Liverpool. With Scholes still suspended and O'Shea dropped to the bench, there is a rare chance for Richardson to stumble over the ball a few times. Meanwhile, Gareth Southgate restores his best players to the line-up after incurring the wrath of Warnock on Saturday. The gobby Sheffield United manager was unhappy that Southgate named a team so hapless at the weekend that even Man City were even able to take three points from them. 7.57pm Crikey, you're a tetchy lot when we're a bit tardy with the preamble, aren't you? \"Away, Mike! Give us some preamble,\" says Gavin Twedily. \"There's Boro fans sat in front of computer screens all around the world anxious to know whether Arca is playing. What's the weather like? Is Pogatetz fit? Can you hear the Boro fans singing? How was your day?\" \"Where is the team news? Too busy getting pi$$ed are we? Steve Jol (yeah, I'll send my brother Martin around, so put the can down!)\" \"Hurry up and write something. I need Preamble. This is my highlight of the day,\" says Richard Brown. Alright, alright, calm down, calm down. We're almost underway. Oh, and before you all start, Craig Cathcart on the United bench is a Belfast-born teenager, according to the (un)trustworthy Press Association. 7.59pm \"Since you ask,\" begins Ian Pickup, confusing me with the chap who wrote the caption under the picture of Ronaldo, \"as someone who stood on the terraces at Old Trafford in the 60s, I can say that Besty always stayed on his feet when he could. Just watch the George Best videos on YouTube, and see how he rides the tackles. When Ronaldo can stay on his feet like that, he can compare.\" 1 min And they're off. Yakubu sets off on a powerful run, but tries to take on one too many defenders and Ferdinand pinches the ball off him. 3 mins \"Don't worry Mike, real men don't do preamble,\" says Roland Marshall. \"Minimalism is the way forward. Here's hoping Boro have a minimal amount of celebrating to do come the end of the night.\" 4 mins Viduka has had a good start against Vidic, who's been strangely shoddy in the past few weeks. First, he nipped in ahead of the big Serbian to receive Taylor's pass; then he outjumped the defender to head Schwarzer's long boot forward, but Yakubu failed to read the flick. 5 mins First attack for United. Ronaldo squares to Rooney, but his shot deflects off Woodgate for a corner. Giggs's outswinger is nodded down by Vidic, but it's an easy save for Schwarzer. It makes such a difference to a team if you have a centre-half who can get you half a dozen goals a season from set-pieces, and that is certainly a strength of Vidic's. 7 mins Downing's turn to take a corner, but his ball in is headed back out by the most underrated header of a ball in the Premiership, Ryan Giggs. Suddenly Ronaldo and Rooney attack with the same pace which enabled them to score that wonderful second goal against Bolton on Saturday. When Rooney is tackled on the edge of the Boro box, a chance falls to Ronaldo, but he hits slightly across the ball and it flies a couple feet wide of the post. 9 mins Smith beats the offside trap down the left flank and then delivers a brilliant, low, teasing cross that Taylor has to turn behind. The corner comes to nothing though. It's been an adventurous start to the game from both teams. 10 mins \"Gavin Twedily called you a lazy ba$tard over on Tottenham v Chelsea,\" says Simon Frank. \"Are you going to take that?\" I've been called far worse, Simon. What really grates is that you've been cheating on me by flirting with Tom Lutz's prose. 13 mins Pogatetz, who had the courage/folly to criticise Ronaldo last week by claiming he showboats unnecessarily, has a hack at Smith's ankles and concedes a free-kick. I'm looking forward to Pogatetz and Ronaldo clashing. 15 mins \"Here's a thought,\" from Jeremy Adams. \"How come we should send our 'thoughts and musing' to Tom Lutz but should send our 'ramblings and idle musings' to you? Surely musing requires some mental activity and is therefore not idle?\" I guess it all comes down to quality control. Spurs-Chelsea is arguably the more interesting game, hence is likely to attract more readers and emails. Therefore, while your memos might have to have some semblance of intellect/wit/information to get in Lutz's MBM, here you can get away with pretty much anything. That's pretty much anything. 16 mins So close from Viduka! Xavier's cross deflected to the chubb... sorry, big-boned striker on the edge of the box, but his first-time half-volley skidded inches wide of Kusczszcszszcszsak's right-hand post. 18 mins Boateng lets fly, but Ku'ak is able to watch this one go harmlessly over his bar. 20 mins Giggs sends over a free-kick from the right-hand touchline, Heinze's long locks beat Woodgate's long locks to the ball, but his glanced effort is wide. 22 mins Someone in a white shirt, ie a Middlesbrough player, dribbles a shot towards Kuszczak that the United keeper gobbles up. Sorry I didn't see who. \"Roland be right (3 mins) - minimalism be best,\" says Rolf from Sweden. \"Skip the preamble, amble, and cut to the post-amble. Here's one we made earlier: 'Well, it was/wasn't exactly as I expected [add substantiating argument + purple prose + face-saving witticism here] Thanks for your emails, sorry I couldn't use them all, Mike/Barry/Sean/Paolo/Georgina'.\" That is a very handy template, Rolf, thanks. 24 mins Andy Gray, Sky commentator: \"It feels like a semi-final this.\" Andy, come on, give Watford some credit! Ronaldo has two shots within a minute - the first one is scuffed and deflected wide, the second one is scuffed and could have done with a deflection. 26 mins Smith skips past the weak challenge of Pogatetz, but his subsequent cross is too far in front of the unmarked Rooney. He really should have picked out his strike partner for an easy tap-in. \"Surely with their owner's wealth, the Fulham manager shouldn't have to resort to double-jobbing when they visit Old Trafford (see photo credit)?\" quips Justin Kavanagh. \"Who'd be a football manager, indeed?!\" 28 mins Boro have tightened up and are trying to stultify the creativity of United's midfield, but that plan doesn't account for Arca gifting Giggs the ball in Boro's half. After a one-two with Rooney, Giggs swings his unpredictable right foot at the ball but his shot is blocked. 30 mins After Ronaldo took a corner with all the skill of Jenson Button, set-piece taking duty is handed to Michael Carrick. His ball in is cleared by Woodgate, who's having a darn good game. 32 mins Time for me to don that anorak: United have had eight shots to Boro's six, though only two of United's have been on target compared to Boro's one. \"Once again I notice that your commentary runs from the bottom upwards, whereas Tom Lutz has the Chelsea/Tottenham game reading from top to bottom,\" observes Marcel Villeneuve (and countless others). \"Is there a good reason for this?\" I blame that Lutz fellow - he's been used to doing the over-by-over. But come on, it's not really that disastrous, is it? 34 mins Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant defending from Woodgate. Taylor dived in on Ronaldo, who danced around him on the right-hand side of the penalty area. Pogatetz came racing across to close Ronaldo down, leaving Smith unmarked in the process. When Ronaldo took an extra touch before squaring to Smith, Woodgate used that bonus second to leave his own man, sprint over and slide in front of the blond United striker, somehow preventing him from scoring from point-blank range. 37 mins Middlesbrough back off and encourage Vidic to bring the ball out of defence. When still there was nobody closing him down 35 yards out, he decides to have a pop. He'd have been better off getting down on his hands and knees and heading the ball at goal. 39 mins It's mostly United, but in truth Schwarzer hasn't had much to worry him. Scrap that! Giggs, who has been probing the Boro back four better than anyone tonight, threads an incisive pass between Woodgate and Pogatetz for Rooney, but Schwarzer snaffles the ball as the forward tries to dribble around him. 41 mins If Boro can keep it goalless deep into the second half, they can take heart when they look at the United bench - there aren't too many players sitting there who you'd expect to win the game for the home team. A couple that might lose it, but none that would win it. 44 mins With Boro barely having any possession in the last 10 minutes, I estimate Viduka has walked - run would be too strong - about 10 metres in that time. If only Sky still had PlayerCam and it had featured Viduka for that spell, it would have been the least interesting 10 minutes of TV since Anne Robinson presented Points of View. Half-time Like a party political broadcast, that was a half that promised much, but delivered little. United have been the better team, but Boro have defended well for the most part. Sky presenter Richard Keys reckons \"that's half the job that Middlesbrough set out to accomplish\", but if their aim is to keep the score goalless, they actually still have 75 minutes to go. Let's hope for all our sakes that doesn't happen. Half-time emails \"Does the influence of the mighty GU extend to the Football Writers' Society?\" asks Gary Naylor, who I reckon probably knows the answer to that question. \"I ask because I really, really want Ryan Giggs to be Footballer of the Year. Amazingly, he hasn't won it and, quite frankly, he should.\" We'll be having our own player awards at the end of the season and you'll be able to vote for them, so you can try to sway the bloggers then, Gary. \"Has anyone answered the question you have on the picture of Ronaldo?\" asks Chris Iquendo, who obviously can't be bothered to scroll down the page. \"Let me be the first... Yes he is. He even has other qualities that Best didn't have such as excellent diving, invisible card waving, greasy hair gel to mention some.\" Greasy hair gel? Have you never seen photos of Best's flowing mane? \"Notice that in half an hour there is not a single mention of the great Keiran Richardson,\" notes Roger Shoreman, who has such little respect for the United left winger that he even refuses to spell his name correctly. \"Doubt Keano has changed his views about him!\" I can't see him lining up for Sunderland any time soon. \"Is it true Viduka gets a lifetime supply of sausage rolls for free if he scores the winner tonight?\" asks Tim Merrick, before laughing uproariously at his own gag. \"Hey, can I get a shout out for Martin Heward-Mills?\" asks, erm, Martin Heward-Mills. \"It's been a hard day at work and the claim to fame may just see me through the evening.\" And before you get any ideas, that's the first and last of those. \"The best thing about the NCAA tournament is that you know the draw for all 64 teams before the first tip-off,\" says Andrew McDonald Exum. \"So that allows you and your family and co-workers to predict the winners, enter office pools, and taunt all those whose favorites crash out in the first round. With the FA Cup (or Uefa Cup for that matter), they have a new draw every round. What fun is that?\" And before I'm able to explain to Andrew how much fun it used to be watching Graham Kelly drone out \"and that concludes the draw, ties will be played on...\" I have to end this section because the second half is about to start. 46 mins Boro start the second half with the same conviction with which they started the first, Downing sprinting past Brown before hanging a cross up to the back past. But Vidic a-leaps like the 10 lords and takes the ball off Viduka's head. 48 mins Boro load the United box for a Taylor free-kick, but the youngster's cross is overhit and the United keeper, who's name is fiendishly difficult to type at speed, claims it easily. 50 mins Heinze cuts in off the left wing, but his right-footed shot resembles one of my golf drives - shanked and utterly embarrassing. 52 mins A series of gaffes in the Boro defence almost allows Ronaldo a free run at goal, but Taylor's last-ditch tackle denies him that chance. Then Smith launches himself into a tackle on Woodgate's legs a full second after the Boro defender had sent the ball upfield. He's rightly booked. 54 mins Downing drops a shoulder and saunters past Brown all too easily again. From the byline he floats a cross to the edge of the six-yard box, but it was just too high for Yakubu to be able to direct a header on target. Moments later, Viduka finds some space inside the penalty area and cuts the ball back to Downing, but the winger slices his shot as Vidic and Brown throw themselves in front of it. That was a great chance. 56 mins Another opening for Boro, but Yakubu's shot from 20 yards is poor. He had peeled off Vidic to receive Cattermole's pinpoint pass, but it was a comfortable save for Kuszczak. All of a sudden United are rattled. 59 mins Paradoxically, the more Boro grow in confidence, the more likely United are to score. With Taylor caught upfield, Ronaldo exploits the vacated space down the Boro left to run onto Rooney's astute pass. Schwarzer comes rushing out to close down Ronaldo, who knocks the ball past the keeper before rolling it from a tight angle against the post. 60 mins Rooney is booked for mouthing off at the ref. Not that the yellow card puts an end to his tirade, mind. 61 mins Both teams make a change. The dogged Park comes on for Richardson, with Ronaldo switching to the left, while Morrison replaces Cattermole. 64 mins \"Have to agree with Mr Pickup (preamble, 7:59),\" says John Thompson, somewhat belatedly. \"Best used to ride out the tackles to show that even if they tried to pull him down, he could still get past them. It was all part of his nature: fun, a little arrogance, lots of confidence and almost unlimited skill (I was going to write unlimited skill but that would have alerted the pedants).\" As if to prove the point, Ronaldo shrugs off an initial challenge from Boateng as he dribbles down the left wing, but then after losing possession collapses under Boateng's second challenge. 66 mins Morrison's first involvement is a defence-splitting pass ... to Rooney. Rooney elects to shoot early rather than carry the ball forward, but Schwarzer parries his swerving and dipping strike. 68 mins Until this match I was wondering why, given the injuries to Neville and Richards, Brown isn't in Steve McClaren's England squad. Now I can see why. Brown has frequently been careless at right-back tonight, as he is again here when he fouls Downing unnecessarily. 69 mins Boro sub: Arca off, Rochemback on. 70 mins Schwarzer foils a Rooney one-on-one for the second time this evening! Played through by Giggs (again), Rooney sprung the offside trap but saw his shot saved by the big Boro keeper's right foot. 71 mins Rochemback concedes a free-kick on the edge of the box by stupidly handling the ball. He was under no pressure, and now Giggs and Ronaldo are discussing who is going to drill this into the wall... 72 mins Giggs wins the right to do so, and duly curls it onto Pogatetz's head. Rochemback should feel mightily relieved. 73 mins Sub for United: Smith off, O'Shea on. Can the Irishman repeat his Anfield trick? Giggs has joined Rooney up front. 75 mins PENALTY FOR UNITED! Ronaldo runs in behind Xavier and onto Heinze's pass, then knocks the ball past Woodgate, who clips his heels. The ref had no option but to point to the spot. It's Ronaldo v Schwarzer... GOAL! Man Utd 1 - 0 Middlesbrough (Ronaldo 76 pen) Ronaldo sends Schwarzer the wrong way and, just for good measure, sidefoots the ball right into the top corner. Even if Schwarzer had dived the correct way he wouldn't have saved that. 78 mins Woodgate was booked for his foul on Ronaldo, and now Pogatetz racks up his ninth yellow card of the season by scything down Giggs. Giggs has been the man of the match in my opinion. 80 mins Things are getting tasty on the touchline. Not for the first time this season Middlesbrough have been complaining that Ronaldo dived, with their coaching staff reportedly shouting \"cheat\" at the winger. Queiroz took exception to this and had to be physically restrained from approaching the Boro bench. It looked a clear-cut penalty at first, though watching an action replay from a different angle is inconclusive. Relations between Southgate and Ferguson have been strained since the United boss said earlier in the season that all managers in the Premiership should have the requisite coaching badges. 83 mins Boro have shown little to suggest they might claw their way back into this game. Giggs has dropped back into a three-man midfield and United are keeping possession at will. \"Reference to Graham Kelly at the FA Cup draw reminds me of that rictus smile with which he used to favour the camera,\" says Gary Naylor. \"But nothing could beat the Rugby League Challenge Cup draw. To hear Maurice Lindsay, whose voice makes Alan Bennett sound like Arnie, enunciating \"Keighley Cougars, Warrington Wolves, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats\" and the rest of the preposterous Americanisms was the kind of comedy of which Ricky Gervais can only dream.\" 85 mins Tidy stuff from Morrison, who turns O'Shea and spreads the play to Xavier, but his cross is aimless and Ferdinand clears. 87 mins United are camped on the edge of their penalty area now. The promixity of their defence to their keeper is nearly their undoing when Vidic almost heads past Kuszczak. The Polish keeper's reactions were quick enough to prevent an own goal. 88 mins Boro sub: Taylor off, Huth on. Presumably the big German will play up front and act as a focal point for long balls from the Boro defence. 90 mins Rooney and Boateng have a slight altercation about who's got the better football boots or something, for which the ref books the Boro player but then chooses not to show a second yellow card to the United player after realising that would mean sending him off. 90 mins There will be four minutes of added time. 90 mins + 2 RED CARD FOR MORRISON! Just seconds after Rochemback is booked for taking out Heinze, Morrison is rightly dismissed for a despicable two-footed tackle on Ronaldo down in the corner. That was a horrendous challenge. Rooney comes in to tell Morrison what he thinks of him - which isn't much by the looks of things - and is wisely pulled away by Giggs before he is also sent off. Full time There's been plenty of friction between these two teams this season and it all came to a head in the last quarter of an hour tonight. As the two teams applaud their fans, Queiroz and the Boro coaching staff have to be separated by the fourth official and stewards. Fergie prefers to rub in the fact that Boro's season is over with a few fist-pumps in the eyeline of Gareth Southgate. It was a deserved victory for United, but there's sure to be a lengthy post-match discussion about the penalty that kept their dream of a treble alive.
