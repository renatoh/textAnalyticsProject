In a sign of an impending western clampdown on Kiev, the US imposed visa travel bans on around 20 senior members of the Ukrainian government on Wednesday. A senior State Department official said the sanctions, which restrict the travel of named individuals, were targeted against \u201cpeople who we consider responsible\u201d for violent confrontations with protesters. President Viktor Yanukovych met with opposition leaders and issued a statement calling for a truce and for negotiations on ending bloodshed to begin. One of the protest leaders, Vitali Klitschko, said that Yanukovych had assured them there would be no attempt to storm the protesters\u2019 encampment. The Ukrainian army deployed paratroopers to defend military bases. President Obama condemned the violence and warned the government that the US would be watching them very carefully. The EU and the US threatened sanctions against the Ukrainian government while Russia urged western countries to keep out of Ukrainian affairs. There are still several hundred people at the barricades at Independence Square, according to Harriet Salem. Protesters are firing occasional fireworks at the police lines and police are firing jets of water from their water cannons at the burning barricades. Harriet says the protesters she has spoken to have no faith in Yanukovich\u2019s talk of a truce and they remain vigilant for the next attempt to remove them. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich said on Wednesday he had agreed a \u201ctruce\u201d with opposition leaders, reports Reuters. A statement on the presidential website said that during talks with the three main opposition leaders, Yanukovich had agreed firstly a truce and secondly \u201cthe start to negotiations with the aim of ending bloodshed, and stabilising the situation in the state in the interests of social peace.\u201d The statement, issued on the eve of a visit by the foreign ministers of Germany, Poland and France, appeared to indicate that riot police who on Tuesday night advanced on to Kiev\u2019s Independence Square would not take further immediate steps to break up the encampment of protesters. Former economy minister Arseny Yatseniuk, one of the opposition leaders, said in a statement on the website of his Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party: \u201cThe storming of the Maidan (Independence Square) which the authorities had planned today will not take place. \u201cA truce has been declared. The main thing is to protect human life,\u201d he said. Yanukovich issued his statement after meeting Yatseniuk and the two other opposition leaders, boxer-turned-politician Vitaly Klitschko and far-right nationalist Oleh Tyahnibok. Opposition leaders have just been meeting with Yanukovych who has promised there will be no assault on the protesters. The BBC has reported that the Ukrainian government has sent paratroopers to defend military intallations across the country while the head of Nato, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has warned Ukraine not to use the army to crush protests. Dan Roberts has just filed this statement from President Obama which he made before his meeting with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the president of Mexico. The United States condemns in the strongest terms the violence that\u2019s taking place. And we have been deeply engaged with our European partners as well as the Ukrainian government and the opposition to try to ensure that that violence ends. But we hold the Ukrainian government primarily responsible for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protestors in an appropriate way, that the Ukrainian people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression. And I want to be very clear as we work through these next several days in Ukraine that we\u2019re going to be watching closely and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protestors. We\u2019ve also said we expect peaceful protestors to remain peaceful and we\u2019ll be monitoring very closely the situation, recognising that with our European partners and the international community there will be consequences if people step over the line. And that includes making sure the Ukrainian military does not step into what should be a set of issues that can be resolved by civilians. So the United States will continue to engage with all sides in the dispute in Ukraine and ultimately our interest is to make sure the Ukrainian people can express their own desires and we believe a large majority of Ukrainians are interested in an integration with Europe and the commerce and cultural exchanges that are possible for them to expand opportunity and prosperity. But regardless of how the Ukrainian people determine their own future it is important the people themselves make those decisions and that\u2019s what the United States will continue to strive to achieve. Ukrainian news agency releases a list of ten dead policemen, the two youngest were born in 1993. President Obama is speaking in Mexico, condemning the violence in Kiev and calling for a civilian resolution. Riot police resting at the other side of the square from the protesters. Here\u2019s our latest reports from Shaun Walker on Putin\u2019s reaction to events in Kiev and our correspondents in Germany and the United States on the threat of sanctions from the EU and the US. Here are some concluding tweets from Lavrov. Here\u2019s the latest Guardian edited video from Kiev. Before and after images of Independence Square. Harriet Salem has just called described to me the current situation in the Maidan before she was interupted by a loud explosion which she believed came from the centre of the square. The barricades are burning and the frontlines are populated by young to middle-aged men. Beyond the barricades, I can see the police who are not moving at the moment although they have threatened to carry out an \u2018anti-terrorist\u2019 operation against the protesters. The territory held by the protesters is much smaller than it was at the same time last night. There is a constant banging as protesters of all ages and sexes break the cobbles from the street and break them into smaller stones and transport them to the frontlines. You can also see Molotov cocktail factories of similar people filling bottles with petrols and moving them up to the frontlines. The food kitchens are operating and there has been music and speeches throughout the day. The atmosphere is tense as everybody watches and waits. AP has reported that the Ukrainian president has replaced the head of army after clashes between police, protesters kill 25 people. Time reports on the fears in Ukraine that Russia will intervene if its politcial allies cannot hold the line against protesters. Reuters have just snapped this: GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS AGREED WITH RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN BY TELEPHONE TO DO EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO AVOID ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE This is a live feed from Independence Square. It seems quiet with fires burning and liitle movement. We\u2019ll be hearing from Harriet Salem who is there shortly. Spurs fans are on their way to Dnipropetrovsk for their Europa League tie on Thursday. The game will take place and the Foreign Office is not advising against travel. This is the latest from Spurs. We remain in contact with the British Embassy and have been advised that the Police in Dnipropetrovsk have been briefed to expect British fans and the situation there is stable and under control. Once again travelling fans are advised to avoid gatherings and areas where demonstrations could occur such as public squares and administrative buildings during journeys to and from the stadium. For those fans travelling via Kiev, the Metro in Kiev is currently still not operating - details on how to get from Boryspil Airport to the railway station in Kiev is available by clicking here. The Foreign Office have announced that the UK embassy in Kiev has been closed to visitors. Reuters report that Russia has withheld a financial aid package for technical reasons. Delivery of $2 billion credit to Ukraine from Russia, the second tranche of a promised $15 billion aid package, has been delayed until Friday, a Ukrainian government source said on Wednesday. A first tranche of $3 billion, aimed at helping the ex-Soviet republic pay foreign debts this year and prop up its national currency amid widespread unrest, was disbursed at the end of December. Ukraine\u2019s interim government had been hoping a second tranche of $2 billion would be delivered soon by Russian purchase of Ukraine-issued eurobonds. But a Ukrainian government source said: \u201cThe deal has been put off until Friday for technical reasons. We expect the money to come on Friday.\u201d Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has criticised the opposition and western governments for supporting an attempted coup and not criticising manifestations of nazism. Harriet Salem sends more from Kiev. Nina Potarskaya, 30, worked last night for Euromaidan protesters coordinating medical volunteers across Kiev. \u201cI can confirm I saw people with injuries from live ammunition: one man arrived at Hospital 17 with a punctured lung; there were many other people with injuries and contusions from grenades,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly people who are very seriously hurt will go to the hospital, because they are afraid that they will be arrested if they go there, so people with smaller injuries would rather not seek treatment.\u201d Mykola Polishchuk, Kiev\u2019s chief neurosurgeon and Ukraine\u2019s minister of health in 2005, helped treat the wounded throughout the night. \u201cI was in the centre of all the action. The most extreme injuries started to come in after 2pm. Most of the injured people had head injuries they had been hit with stones and bricks. There were injuries from live ammunition as well,\u201d he said, standing outside Mychailivskiy Cathedral, which first served as a makeshift hospital following the first police attack on Maidan in November. \u201cWhat was surprising for me was how professional the work of the volunteer medical sisters was. I saw the first three people who died. The first was injured in the heart. The second one had his head split at the back, his brain was badly injured and he died in a few minutes. The third person died when someone drove over him with a car. \u201cI saw many things last night. But no injured person blamed anyone or yelled or cried for help. I saw young people who had a lot of injuries in their legs and their hips from grenades, and they just said: \u2018Make a bandage and we will go on the frontline again.\u2019 \u201cWhen we called for the ambulances, the riot police prevented them from coming close to the hospital and took the ambulance to treat their own men. I tried to persuade them that we had much more serious injuries inside, but they would not listen. One ambulance was attacked and destroyed by titushki [suspected hired thugs] with baseball bats; around 30 medical vehicles [including volunteers with cars] had their tyres slashed even though they were filled with injured people trying to get to the hospitals.\u201d My colleague Paul Lewis sends this from Washington, DC: Washington has until now been cool on sanctions against Ukraine, but I suspect that may be about to change. Senior White House officials are actively considering the possibility of introducing EU-style sanctions in the coming days. In an unexpected move, Barack Obama, who is en route to Mexico for a summit of North American leaders, is expected to make remarks about the situation in Ukraine. British prime minister David Cameron has put out a statement condemning the violence on \u201call sides\u201d. I am deeply concerned by the scenes we\u2019re witnessing in Ukraine. The violence on all sides is completely unacceptable and President Yanukovych has a particular responsibility to pull back government forces and to de-escalate the situation ... Violence is not the way to resolve the political differences across the country ... It\u2019s a critical moment for the future of Ukraine. President Yanukovych should be under no doubt that the world is watching his actions and those responsible for violence will be held accountable. Here is a summary of recent developments: \u2022 The US has raised the prospect of joining the EU in imposing sanctions on Ukraine in an attempt to end the violence there. Barack Obama is to discuss the issue later on Wednesday on a trip to Mexico. \u2022 The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland, plus EU foreign minister Lady Ashton, are heading to Kiev for meetings with government and opposition figures, including president Viktor Yanukovych. After that they will fly to Brussels, where the EU will hold an extraordinary meeting of its 28 members to discuss sanctions. \u2022 The bloodiest night in independent Ukraine\u2018s history left at least 25 people dead and more than 200 injured, after further violent clashes in the centre of Kiev. Armed riot police clashed with protesters armed with clubs and molotov cocktails as they tried to take back Independence Square, the hub of the protests against Yanukovych\u2018s government over the past three months. By morning, they had taken back about a third of the square, which has become a scene of charred devastation. \u2022 Russia has threatened to use its influence in Ukraine to bring the violence to an end. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said: \u201cUkraine is a friendly brother state and a strategic partner, and we will use all our influence in order for peace and calm to reign.\u201d \u2022 There have been sporadic clashes between riot police and protesters in Kiev as both side regrouped after a night of violence. Overnight there were large explosions, with reports of tear gas, flash grenades, and molotov cocktails as police advanced on protesters in the square, clashing at the front line. Water cannon were brought in and used unsuccessfully to try to douse fires which also burned down the Trade Union Hall. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, spoke to Yanukovych by phone today to condemn the use of force against protesters and urge an immediate end to violence. In a statement the European commission said: He conveyed his shock and dismay with the recent clashes in Ukraine which led to an important number of dead and injured people. He called for an immediate end of the violence and firmly condemned the use of force to solve the political crisis. The German foreign ministry has also confirmed the German/French/Polish trip to Kiev. Here\u2019s more from US secretary of state John Kerry\u2019s statement on Ukraine in Paris. He said the choice facing Ukraine was \u201ccompromise and dialogue versus violence and mayhem\u201d. Kerry said he had been talking about the possibility for sanctions with friends in the EU and elsewhere. \u201cOur desire is for Mr Yanukovych to bring people together and have dialogue with the opposition,\u201d he said. President Yanukovych has the opportunity to make a choice. The choice is between protecting the people that he serves ... and [the] choice for compromise and dialogue versus violence and mayhem. We are talking about the possibility of sanctions or other steps with our friends in Europe and elsewhere in order to try to create the environment for compromise. According to AP, Fabius, Sikorski and German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier will meet opposition figures as well as those from the government tomorrow on their trip to Ukraine. After Kiev, the three ministers will fly to Brussels for the emergency EU meeting to consider sanctions. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, has confirmed that trip to Kiev to see Yanukovych with his German and Polish counterparts. He was speaking in Paris alongside John Kerry: With my Polish and German colleagues we have decided to go to Kiev tomorrow morning ... to gather the latest information before the meeting in Brussels. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has been speaking in Paris, where he has said there is still time for compromise in Ukraine. He said the EU was discussing the possibility of sanctions in order to try create the conditions for such a compromise, Reuters reports. The White House has said it is monitoring the volatile situation in Ukraine and will consult with European partners on next steps, possibly including sanctions, to end to the deadly violence, the Associated Press reports. Ben Rhodes, a US national security adviser, said US officials were consulting with the EU on such issues as who should be held responsible for the violence and whether to impose sanctions. Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, has just tweeted that he and the foreign ministers of Germany and Poland, with the support from EU foreign minister Lady Ashton, will be meeting Yanukovych tomorrow. Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, is heading to the Ukrainian capital at the request of the European Union, he has said on Twitter. Harriet Salem writes from Kiev, where cafe staff are saying they have been told by the security services to close by 6pm local time (4pm GMT). She sends this report from Independence Square: Natalyia, a 66-year-old grandmother of two from Kiev dressed in a black leather coat, clutched a handbag in one hand while with the other she piled up cobblestones prised from the pavement on Independence Square. She was just one of many people working to take the rocks to the protesters at the front lines to use in their battles against the police. \u201cI saw what people were doing and just joined in,\u201d she said. \u201cThis situation we have now in Ukraine is terrible. I am so upset. I cannot eat. I didn\u2019t sleep all night yesterday and today. I have no energy anymore. I am exhausted.\u201d She said her 77-year-old husband would join her soon with his ice pick to help remove the stones. \u201cOur struggle is for Ukraine to be democratic, for courts to be courts, for parliament to be parliament, for a president to be a president. This is all.\u201d Osels stood on a pile of rubble at the front line on Independence Square leaning on a makeshift shield. \u201cI was here all last night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to hold back the police as far as it was possible; they wanted to burn the trade union building, the stage and the camp. The police threw grenades. This was their strategy to stop the revolution.\u201d As he talked fireworks flashed across the still-burning diminished barricades, explosions of an unknown source echoed across the square, and plumes of black smoke billowed from the former Euromaidan HQ. Osels\u2019 colleague pointed up at an adjacent building; a figure dressed in a black uniform was visible for just a minute before disappearing. \u201cIt is a sniper, there are two up there I have seen them since this morning,\u201d he said. A consensus has been reached over sanctions against Ukrainian officials, according to the Polish deputy foreign minister Piotr Serafin. Serafin was speaking to reporters after Polish PM Donald Tusk held telephone consultations on Ukraine with other EU heads of government and leaders of European institutions. Serafin said: The events over the last 24 hours justify the decision of the European Union on sanctions. There was full unity of views among all the people with whom Prime Minister Tusk spoke. Ukraine\u2019s state security service said it was launching an \u201canti-terrorist operation\u201d across the country after the seizure of administrative buildings and arms and ammunition depots by \u201cextremist groups\u201d. A live feed from Kiev\u2019s Independence Square currently shows a tense standoff between the riot police and protesters, as the occasional shot rings out. Security chief Oleksandr Yakimenko said in a statement: \u201cIn many regions of the country, municipal buildings, offices of the interior ministry, state security and the prosecutor general, army units and arms depots, are being seized. Courtrooms are being burned down, vandals are destroying private apartments, killing peaceful citizen.\u201d He added that the last 24 hours, had shown \u201ca growing escalation of violent confrontation and widespread use of weapons by extremist-oriented groups.\u201d Merkel is still not entirely convinced by sanctions against Ukraine, but her position appears to be shifting in the wake of latest violence. Reuters quoted her telling that press conference in Paris that the threat of sanctions was meant to show Kiev that the European Union is serious about the need for a return to political dialogue. She said: \u201cWhen (EU) foreign ministers meet tomorrow in Brussels they must talk about which specific sanctions should be imposed to show we are serious that the political process must resume ... But sanctions alone are not enough.\u201d She added that it was also necessary to talk to both the opposition and President Yanukovich\u2019s government to help bring peace to Ukraine. Very disturbing footage has emerged purporting to show the security service building in central Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi being riddled with machine gun fire during a protest. The shots came while the main doors to the building were being smashed by protesters. The footage shows the bleeding body of a woman who was shot in the incident. Protesters are then shown pushing trolley buses in front of the building as a barricade. The footage [warning: upsetting content] , cannot be independently verified. Ukraine\u2019s security agency says protesters seized more 1,500 firearms during the latest clashes. Earlier the Interior Ministry claimed that police had not used firearms during the clashes. German chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that the EU will discuss sanctions against Ukraine. Speaking in Paris, after meeting Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, she said such a measure would show the EU is serious about wanting a political solution. Earlier this month she ruled out sanctions. Hollande said those who have caused the deadly violence in Ukraine \u201cwill be sanctioned.\u201d He called the violence \u201cintolerable.\u201d Protesters have also been stockpiling petrol bombs ahead of fears that feared police attack this evening, according to the latest video from Independence Square. The deathtoll from the latest violence has been revised upwards. The Health Ministry said 26 people were killed in the fighting in the capital, including 10 police officers. A ministry official, quoted by Interfax, said a further 263 protesters and 342 police officers were being treated for injuries. Protesters in Kiev have been stockpiling cobblestones amid fears of another police crackdown this evening. Journalist Max Seddon said the opposition claims a new police attack is being planned for 6pm local time (just over two hours time). Channel 4 News has a live feed of Kiev\u2019s Independence Square. It currently shows protesters gathering to hear speeches as ranks of riot police look on. The International Olympic Committee has banned Ukrainian competitors in the Sochi winter games from wearing black armbands to commemorate the deaths of protesters and police in Kiev, writes Shaun Walker in Kiev. The country\u2019s Olympic association said in a statement that it had asked the IOC if it competitors could mark the \u201cdeep pain over the loss of fellow countrymen\u201d by wearing black armbands. \u201cThe answer was received from the IOC that in accordance with the Olympic charter it is not possible to do this,\u201d said the statement. Although sponsor logos are everywhere at the Olympics, the IOC regularly bans anything it deems to be \u201cpolitical\u201d. Earlier in the Sochi games, the IOC banned helmet sticker tributes to Sarah Burke, a skier who died in a 2012 accident. Sergey Bubka, the pole-vaulting legend and a former MP for President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions, who leads the Ukrainian delegation to Sochi, appealed on his Twitter account to both sides to stop the violence: \u201cI want to bring Olympic truce to my country. Dialogue is power, violence is weakness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur athletes are competing hard in Sochi, but peacefully and with honour. Violence has no place in the World.\u201d \u201cYes it\u2019s a distraction, everyone\u2019s talking about it - even just now at the start, at the finish, people are saying \u2018what\u2019s happened in your country, what\u2019s happened?\u2019\u201d said Dmytro Mytsak, 18, a Ukrainian giant slalom skier from Kiev after he finished competing yesterday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting support from the Russian spectators and I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d Ukrainian pair Kateryna Serdyuk and Marina Lisogur pulled out of the ladies team sprint classic event in which they were due to compete on Wednesday, but the Ukrainian delegation said that this was due to an injury to Serdyuk rather than for political reasons. Mark Adams, the spokesperson for the IOC, reiterated on Wednesday morning that there was no place for political protests at the Olympics, and criticised the Italian transgender former MP, Vladimir Luxuria, who was detained briefly after holding a rainbow flag that read \u201cGay is OK\u201d, and then again inside the Olympic venues on Monday wearing a rainbow outfit. \u201cShe explicitly had said that she would demonstrate in a venue and clearly venues are not the place where we would like to have political demonstration,\u201d said Adams. In regard to the detention for several hours of nine people including members of the punk group Pussy Riot on Tuesday, Adams said: \u201cI understand that what happened yesterday wasn\u2019t in the context of any demonstration against the Games, so at the moment I don\u2019t have any relationship at all with that incident.\u201d Russia Today has broadcast drone footage of Independence Square during the latest clashes. The footage, which was published today but appears to have been filmed on Tuesday night, shows the blaze at the opposition headquarters in the trades union building. The UN\u2019s human rights chief, Navi Pillay, has called for an independent investigation into the violence in Kiev. In a statement she said: \u201cI call for an urgent and independent investigation to establish facts and responsibilities, including the possible use of excessive force, and to ensure accountability for these deadly clashes.\u201d Britain\u2019s foreign secretary said Ukraine\u2019s leaders should be held to account for the violent crackdown. But tweeting ahead of Thursday afternoon\u2019s emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers, which he is due to attend, William Hague didn\u2019t say whether he would back sanctions. When asked about the possibility of backing EU sanctions, a spokesman for the Foreign Office told Reuters that British government officials \u201chave not ruled anything out at this stage\u201d. Keep an eye on Ukraine\u2019s political elite over the coming days, says David Dalton, Ukraine analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cKey to watch is if any elements of state security, the main oligarchs, Party of Regions members or Communists start to distance themselves from Yanukovych,\u201d he said in emailed analysis of the crisis. He added: Violence has already spread to the regions. This makes compromise less likely and more bloodshed more likely, as stalwarts on both sides dig in their heels. Russia\u2019s Glazyev has also suggested that Russia has the right to intervene (this would mark a much more serious escalation, though). Political destabilisation could tip the precarious financial situation over into crisis, with a knock-on effect for the real economy that would exacerbate popular and elite grievances against the Yanukovych regime. The prospect of high, drawn-out political risk will cast shadow over the economy, making another recession more likely, this year at least. The role of outside powers \u2013 Russia, EU and US \u2013 is usually crucial in these situations. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: EU foreign ministers are to hold an emergency meeting to discuss imposing sanctions on Ukraine\u2019s political leadership in protest at the latest violent crackdown against demonstrations in Kiev. France, Germany and Poland have all indicated they back targeted sanctions and travel bans. The bloodiest night in independent Ukraine\u2018s history left at least 25 people dead and more than 200 injured, after further violent clashes in the centre of Kiev. Armed riot police clashed with protesters armed with clubs and molotov cocktails as they tried to take back Independence Square, the hub of the protests against President Viktor Yanukovych\u2018s government over the past three months. By morning, they had taken back about a third of the square, which has become a scene of charred devastation. Russia has threatened to use its influence in Ukraine to bring the violence to an end. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said: \u201cUkraine is a friendly brother state and a strategic partner, and we will use all our influence in order for peace and calm to reign.\u201d There have been sporadic clashes between riot police and protesters in Kiev as both side regrouped after a night of violence. Overnight there were large explosions, with reports of tear gas, flash grenades, and molotov cocktails as police advanced on protesters in the square, clashing at the front line. Water cannon were brought in and used unsuccessfully to try to douse fires which also burned down the Trade Union Hall. Yanukovych has laid the blame for deaths at the opposition\u2019s door, and called for it to disassociate itself from \u201cradical forces.\u201d He said some members of the anti-government opposition had crossed a line when they called on supporters to bring weapons to the demonstration in Kiev. Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko addressed around 20,000 protesters camped out at Independence Square, and urged them to hold their ground. He also said he\u2019d walked out of talks with Yanukovych after the president demanded protesters leave the square unconditionally. There has been widespread international condemnation of the violence. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he was shocked and gravely concerned. US vice-president Joe Biden called Yanukovych to urge him to \u201cpull back\u201d the security forces. Pope Francis said he was watching with a \u201cworried soul\u201d. EU officials are refusing to speculate on which Ukrainian officials will be targeted in the probable sanctions, according to Laurence Norman from the Wall Street Journal. Supporters of the opposition in Ukraine have staged a protest outside the European parliament, by laying on the street draped in Ukrainian flags, the BBC\u2019s Peter Henley reports. Here\u2019s Shaun Walker\u2019s take on last night\u2019s violence. Our Moscow correspondent writes: The bloodiest night in independent Ukraine\u2018s history left at least 25 people dead and more than 200 injured, after further violent clashes in the centre of Kiev. Armed riot police clashed with protesters armed with clubs and molotov cocktails as they tried to take back Independence Square, the hub of the protests against President Viktor Yanukovych\u2018s government over the past three months. By morning, they had taken back about a third of the square, which has become a scene of charred devastation. The health ministry said 25 people were dead, including nine police officers. Yanukovych said that the political opposition leaders had \u201ccrossed a line\u201d by not condemning the violent protests, and spoke of stark consequences for them if they did not distance themselves from the violence. Read the rest of the article here. There are unconfirmed reports that some Ukrainian competitors have pulled out of Winter Olympics in Sochi, over a decision to ban them from wearing black armbands. Germany\u2019s foreign minister has threatened the Ukraine with sanctions in response to last night\u2019s violence, confirms Philip Oltermann in Berlin. \u201cThose responsible for decisions that lead to bloodshed have to expect that Europe will rethink its current reservations about sanctions\u201d, Frank-Walter Steinmeier said last night. In a press statement released this morning, Steinmeier ramped up criticism of the Ukrainian president: \u201cUkraine has paid dearly for the delaying tactics of president Yanukovych. His refusal to hold serious talks about a peaceful conflict resolution and constitutional reform is a big mistake.\u201d Over the last few weeks the German chancellory and foreign ministry have been at odds over their stance on the crisis in the Ukraine. At the start of the month, chancellor Angela Merkel had still ruled out sanctions altogether, while Steinmeier had emphasised that sanctions were a \u201cnecessary\u201d threat to keep the pressure on the Ukrainian government. Last night, Merkel reportedly tried to call president Yanukovych three times but failed to make contact. On Monday, Merkel had met opposition leaders Vitali Klitschko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Berlin. \u201cThe agreement on an amnesty for demonstrators is, in her opinion, a positive step,\u201d Merkel\u2019s spokesperson Steffen Seibert said after the meeting. \u201cNow, however, things mustn\u2019t stop; now the point is to energetically push ahead with progress on forming a government and reform of the constitution\u201d. Critics accuse large EU member states like Germany of failing to work out a coherent strategy in its approach to the crisis in the Ukraine. \u201cThe EU still ducks the hard questions\u201d, wrote Judy Dempsey of foreign-policy think tank Carnegie Europe. \u201cWhat is the EU\u2019s goal in its Eastern neighbourhood? Is EU membership a realistic prospect for the countries in the East? Or is the EU offering a special partnership that confers extensive trade and other rights but falls short of membership?\u201d Meanwhile, Gregor Gysi of the leftwing party Die Linke, has proposed that Gerhard Schr\u00f6derm could be drafted in as a negotiator between Russia and the EU. In Germany, the former chancellor is still representative of more amicable diplomatic relation with Russia than his successor. European Commission president Barroso has confirmed that \u201ctargeted measures\u201d against those responsible for the use of excessive force are set to be agreed by member states. In a strongly-worded statement he said: It was with shock and utter dismay that we have been watching developments over the last 24 hours in Ukraine. There are no circumstances that can legitimise or justify such scenes ... We condemn in the strongest terms the use of violence as a way to solve a political and institutional crisis. It is the political leadership of the country that has a responsibility to ensure the necessary protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. We call on all sides to immediately put an end to the violence and engage into a meaningful dialogue, responding to the democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people. The EU has been offering its sincere assistance to facilitate political dialogue between the sides and de-escalate the situation. We continue to believe that constitutional reform, formation of a new inclusive government and creating conditions for democratic elections constitute the only way-out of this deep and long-lasting political crisis. We have made it clear we stand ready to support Ukraine on this road of reforms, towards democracy, stability and prosperity. We have made it clear that our offer of political association and economic integration remains on the table, and does not constitute the final goal in our cooperation. Yet, we have also made it clear that the EU will respond to any deterioration on the ground. We therefore expect that targeted measures against those responsible for violence and use of excessive force can be agreed by our Member States as a matter of urgency, as proposed by the High Representative/Vice President.

Russia has made more ominous sounding warnings to the Ukrainian opposition, by telling its leaders to \u201cstop the bloodshed\u201d in Kiev and threatening to use Moscow\u2019s influence to bring the violence to an end. In its latest statement on the crisis, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said: The Russian side demands that leaders of the (opposition) stop the bloodshed in their country, immediately resume dialogue with the lawful authorities without threats or ultimatums.

Sky\u2019s Yulia Bragina tweets an image from last night of the scene outside the stadium where the game is due to take place. Poland\u2019s prime minister Donald Tusk said he would press European Union leaders to impose sanctions on Ukraine\u2019s government, following last night\u2019s crackdown. \u201cI will today hold talks with the leaders of the biggest EU countries and institutions, and persuade them to impose sanctions - personal and financial,\u201d Tusk told a special session of the Polish parliament, Reuters reported. \u201cI hope that such a stance from Poland will help the EU as a whole in taking fast decisions,\u201d he added. Britain\u2019s former ambassador to Ukraine also called for sanctions (see earlier). New images show the extent of the fire damage to the Trade Union building that the opposition had used as a base. There were reports that 41 people were rescued from the blaze. Meanwhile, the police continue to rest for now as the extent of the overnight damage becomes clearer, according to the BBC\u2019s Daniel Sandford and Duncan Crawford. Ukraine\u2019s acting prime minister Serhiy Arbuzov has blamed \u201cradical forces\u201d in the opposition for the violence. \u201cProtesters are bringing shame on the country,\u201d he was quoted as telling a cabinet meeting, according to the Kiev Post. He said the unrest was not a sign of democracy but an attempt to seize power by force. Sweden\u2019s foreign minister and former prime minister, Carl Bildt, says President Yanukovych has \u201cblood on his hands\u201d. He also called on the European parliament to show unity in condemning the violence. Britain\u2019s former ambassador to Ukraine, Robert Brinkley, has urged the EU to take tough measures against Ukraine\u2019s leaders for the violent crackdown. \u201cI hope the EU will now impose some sanctions, travel bans or asset freezes on the leadership who ordered these violent crackdowns in Kiev,\u201d he said. But speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Brinkle ywho was ambassador during the Orange revolution, said it \u201cunfair\u201d to claim the EU had offered nothing to Ukraine Every government in Ukraine, including Yanukovych\u2019s, has said it wants to form closer ties with the EU. This is why the president\u2019s decision to halt negotiations with the EU came as such a shock to the population. What the EU has been offering is the so-called deep and comprehensive free trade agreement, which would give Ukraine access to the European Union\u2019s single market, which is eight times bigger than the Russian market. They were offering the Ukraine a route to modernisation of its economy and bigger markets, and becoming a freer and better society. Brinkley also said fears about Ukraine splitting apart had been exaggerated. \u201cThere is no clear dividing line the country as there was between Slovakia and the Czech Republic,\u201d he said. He added that it was too simple to suggest that eastern half of Ukraine was mostly Russian speaking. \u201cFour-sixth of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian as a first language,\u201d he said. \u201cOne sixth are Ukrainians who speak Russian as first language, and one sixth are Russians. So it is not as simple as that. And throughout the country Ukrainians are very conscious that they have their independence.\u201d The latest violence has exposed a widening gulf between Russia and the west over the future of Ukraine. The current unrest began in November when President Yanukovych suddenly abandoned negotiations with the EU on a political and free trade pact, turning instead to Moscow for $15bn-worth of cheap loans and discounted gas supplies. Moscow promptly responded by buying $3bn-worth of Ukrainian bonds, but then stopped lending last month when Yanukovych sacrificed his pro-Kremlin prime minister, Mykola Azarov. Russia blamed the opposition and the west for the latest violence. In a statement Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said: What is going on in Ukraine is a result of the policy of appeasement of those Western politicians and European structures that, from the very beginning of the crisis, have been turning a blind eye on aggressive actions of radical forces in Ukraine, this way prompting them to escalate this crisis and stage provocations against the legitimate authorities. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who has visited Kiev in an attempted to resolve the crisis said she was \u201cdeeply worried about the grave new escalation\u201d. She also expressed concern about the ultimatum issued by the government to end the protests by force. Reports suggest that overnight clashes were followed by a period of continuing tension but relative calm as both the opposition and the police took stock. Police, who occupy part of Independence Square, were photographed resting in a car park, according to Sky\u2019s Yulia Bragina. Journalist Maxim Eristavi said Kiev was in \u201cpartial lockdown\u201d. The BBC\u2019s Duncan Crawford reported only the \u201codd bang\u201d as black smoke rose of the city. His colleague, Daniel Sandford, pointed out that the opposition has been left without its headquarters after the Trade Union building was virtually destroyed by fire. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the clashes in the Ukrainian capital Kiev. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Twenty-five people have been killed, and 241 injured, in fighting between anti-government protesters and police in Kiev, after the security forces tried to take control of the protest camp in Independence Square, or the Maidan. The Interior ministry said nine police officers were among the dead. A renewed push by riot police in the early hours followed the bloodiest day in the country\u2019s post-Soviet history. Riot police launched a renewed assault on the protest camp at 4am local time, the Guardian\u2019s overnight live blog reported. There were large explosions, with reports of tear gas, flash grenades, and molotov cocktails as police advanced on protesters in the square, clashing at the front line. Water cannons were brought in and used unsuccessfully to try and douse fires which also burned dow the Trade Union Hall. President Viktor Yanukovych has laid the blame for deaths at the opposition, and called for them to disassociate themselves from \u201cradical forces.\u201d He said some members of the anti-government opposition had crossed a line when they called on supporters to bring weapons to the demonstration in Kiev. Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko addressed around 20,000 protester camped out at Independence Square, and urged them to hold their ground. He also said he\u2019d walked out of talks with Yanukovych after the president demanded protesters leave the square unconditionally. There has been widespread international condemnation of the violence. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he was shocked and gravely concerned. US vice president Joe Biden called Yanukovych to urge him to \u201cpull back\u201d the security forces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
