He stands at the front of the class in hockey shirt and shorts, while his group of students ping forward examples of different reasons for forced migration. John thinks of the Kosovan Albanians as an example of religious persecution, Nick mentions the slave trade under the \"forced labour\" heading, and there's an interesting discussion with Alex about whether Robert Mugabe's assault on the white farmers can be correctly described as causing migration through racial discrimination. Considering he's only been teaching for three weeks, Davies is doing very well. But then, he is an Oxford University MSc. And, rather more pertinently, his class of eager geographers are all people like him: the first of the new crack corps of high-flying graduates from the best universities who have joined Teach First, the ambitious new fast-track teacher training scheme for London comprehensives. This lesson, at their teacher-training centre, Canterbury Christ Church University College, is pretend. But his initial teacher training is only six weeks long. And in another six weeks, in September, it will be for real. Teach First likes doing things fast. About 18 months ago, two pushy Americans told me about an idea they'd had. Rona Kiley, head of business and education at London First, the lobby group for the capital's companies, and Brett Wigdortz, a 20-something McKinsey consultant, said they wanted to bring top graduates to work in London schools. It was something like Teach for America; they were thinking of calling it Teach for London. The idea was that graduates would go straight into schools for two years, and if they then wanted to go off and work in business, or the City, or elsewhere after that - well, that was OK. They hoped they'd deliver bright, committed young people with marketable skills who could lead in whatever fields they chose, and put something back into their communities. Business wanted to help schools in London; and schools in London wanted more teachers. How about it? They were good to talk to, and I made encouraging noises. But I worried out loud for them. The unions might not wear it. It sounded a bit cut-and-run, all these bright kids going in and then possibly going out; and it would be expensive. And for a worrying while, Kiley and Wigdortz were locked in a vicious circle. Business didn't want to give money without government support; the government didn't want to give money without business support. Just when Wigdortz's six months' unpaid leave from McKinsey was coming to an end, George Iacobescu, chief executive of Canary Wharf, gave \u00a325,000 and things started to snowball. Kiley, who is married to the London transport commissioner, Bob, has a contacts book to die for and a persuasive manner to match. Wigdortz gave up McKinsey to become Teach First's chief executive. They convinced lots of people. Eventually, the government went with it, they got sponsorship, they went down a storm on the university milkround, they carried out a fairly gruelling interview process, and in a little over one month's time 184 graduates from mainly Russell Group universities - the biggest share are from Cambridge - are going into 46 schools across London. The schools tend to be among the most stable and well managed, but all have at least a third of their students on free meals. Assuming all goes to plan, the 184 will be fully qualified teachers within two years - and free to leave. Teach First has thought hard about its appeal. When the idea was just a twinkle in the eye, Wigdortz tried a few slogans out in a focus group at Oxford. \"Change the world\" the students hated. \"A crusade against poverty\" was a no-no. The Americans quickly learned the limits of young Britons' altruism. \"Learn to lead\" went down best. Now they have the classic Blairish slogan: \"Make a difference while keeping your options open.\" Teach First - the name is indicative, too - is putting on mini-MBAs, getting recruiters in to meet their people, delivering internships. When, early on, they did a show of hands, very few said they expected to stay in teaching all their lives. The vast majority - 90% - expected to move between education and other careers. They don't expect and don't want to teach for life. But they are doing it for noble motives. \"If there was a choice between teaching and business, I'm probably more likely to say teaching at the moment,\" says James Townsend, an Oxford history graduate who from September will be in Morpeth school, Tower Hamlets. \"I like to be dropped in at the deep end,\" says Nishi Sood, once a computing student at Umist, soon to be an ICT teacher at Whitefields school, Barnet. \"This has been good but the course is very short. I would have done a PGCE but not with the enthusiasm that I have for this.\" Laura Johnson, an Oxford geographer who will soon be at Archbishop Lanfranc in Croydon, says: \"For me it offers an awful lot of things that a lot of graduate programmes didn't seem to offer. I had thought about teaching but I wasn't sure about it. You know you've got to be really good for these two years, but you haven't closed the door to other options. I do think I might stay. I'd like to stay in education policy. \"The real thing about it is you know for two years you are going to be doing a really challenging job for children who, let's be honest, need the teachers there.\" And so far, so good; she's glad she's on the course. Because they've only got six weeks' preparation, their trainers are having to squeeze. \"I looked at the PGCE curriculum that I generally run and I pared it down to what I thought were the essential concepts, and built them up again,\" says Molly Dussart, a lecturer in science teaching. \"One of the things that's different about these students is that they are so motivated. They are incredibly bright so you can get further, faster, with them.\" Reuben Moore, the history tutor, has been loving every minute since he walked into a feisty row about the teaching of empire on their first day, provoked by one of the students, Mark Smith, a Niall Ferguson acolyte who will soon be teaching at the Krays' old school. That's not to say there aren't people like this doing PGCE; there's just not such a concentration. \"What's special about this group is the way they have become engaged collectively,\" says Sonia Blandford, professor of education. They go on a lot about esprit de corps at Teach First. Wigdortz's team are big on management-consultant speak. Teach First really could go wrong. They are starting to borrow even more blatantly some of the interview methods used by Voluntary Service Overseas: essentially, can you take it? Because these schools are going to be tough. Some graduates have dropped out already, and others will before the two years are up. There are signs that some headteachers are using the Teach First people as a method of delivering a fundamental change in staffroom culture, which could rebound. Teach First, despite all Kiley's efforts to calm the rhetoric down, will do amazingly well to be all it's cracked up to be. But it might be; and it might be even more - important not just for London, but beyond. A generation ago, lots of the best graduates went into teaching. Nowadays only some do. \"They will have a really serious impact on London schools,\" says Blandford. \"They will also have an impact on how the profession views itself. But probably most importantly, it will have an impact on their peers. Because their peers will think: 'we've got Robbie who played rugby at Oxford and he's got a 2.1 and he's doing teaching'.\" Not long ago, that would have been hard to imagine. And if the Teach First people do two years, that's something to be proud of. Many who come through the conventional routes to teaching don't last as long. It could be that this is the price teaching has to pay in today's recruitment market. Jobs can be like relationships: intense, exhausting, fun. And these days even the most serious people can be a little commitment-shy. American dream In 1989, Wendy Kopp had a dream of better educational opportunities for the children of her generation, and thought up the idea of Teach for America - now the model for Teach First. In the first year, they had 2,500 responses from over 100 colleges. TFA is now active in 524 urban and rural public schools; it has affected 1.25m students. A survey in 2001 showed 92% of principals thought TFA had a positive impact on students, 90% on the school environment and 89% on academic achievement. Three quarters regarded TFA members as better than other new teachers. There have been down sides. The teachers stay for only two years, and a lack of experience in the classroom has led to poor class management skills. Even so, a majority of principals think the achievements outweigh the weaknesses. Naomi Drummond"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
