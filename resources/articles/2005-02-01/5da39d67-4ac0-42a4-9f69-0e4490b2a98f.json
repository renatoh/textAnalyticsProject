Today's deal ends DMGT's decade-long association with the Performance Channel, which it bought in 1994, a year after the service launched. Performance, which is broadcast on Sky Digital and Telewest's cable TV network, will be run by Bristol-based Eicom, which formerly traded on the AIM exchange as the Einstein Group. The channel owns the rights to 400 hours of programming, focused on recordings of live performances of ballet, opera and dance, along with rock, pop, jazz, easy listening and classical music. Performance also broadcasts Inside the Actors' Studio, a series of in-depth interviews with leading Hollywood stars. The managing director of Performance, Julian Aston, will stay with DMGT but act as an adviser to Eicom. For much of the 90s DMGT ran the Performance Channel alongside cable news service Channel One, which pioneered the use of new technology in TV newsgathering, including \"VJs\" - journalists who filmed their own reports using lightweight video cameras. DMGT closed its loss-making original Channel One service in London in September 1998 after four years, and sold its stake in spin-off venture Channel One Liverpool to regional newspaper group Trinity International the following June. But DMGT persevered with Performance despite increasing competition in the arts and culture genre, from rival niche channels including BBC4, Artsworld and Classic FM TV. In September 2002 Performance appeared to be on the verge of closure after it was dumped by cable operator NTL, leaving Telewest as its only distribution contract. However, in December of the same year DMGT signed a deal with TV shopping firm Sirius, which gave Performance distribution on Sky Digital. DMGT's remaining broadcasting assets include Teletext, a 29.5% shareholding in GWR, a 20% stake in ITN and ownership of a number of local radio stations in Australia. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
