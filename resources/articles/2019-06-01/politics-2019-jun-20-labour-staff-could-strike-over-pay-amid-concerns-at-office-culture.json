The Guardian understands Labour made an improved pay offer to staff of an annual rise of 2.2% on Thursday \u2013 but that falls short of the staff\u2019s demand for a rise in line with RPI inflation, which stood at 3% in April. The dispute covers all Labour staff, including those at its Southside HQ in Westminster and in the regions, and involves both the GMB and Unite unions. Several employees the Guardian spoke to, on condition of anonymity, said there were particular concerns about the management culture in Corbyn\u2019s office, which they described as ruthless. Staff will be given a vote on the improved offer. Some said they might still vote against the offer \u201con principle\u201d, because they are determined to draw attention to the issue. \u201cPeople are not happy with management and a lot of it seems to centre around his chief of staff,\u201d said one Labour staffer involved in the dispute. \u201cThere is loyalty to Jeremy but we are very concerned that we have found ourselves in this situation.\u201d They added: \u201cIt\u2019s got to the stage where people are afraid to speak up as individuals, because when you do you get sent to Siberia. When an individual has that much power in an organisation, it\u2019s a concern.\u201d And they said that while they had gathered a number of concerns and sought to raise them with management, no formal grievance had been raised because complainants preferred to remain anonymous. At a meeting last week, some staffers said they were so angry they were even prepared to contemplate strike action during the Labour conference \u2013 the most critical week in the party\u2019s calendar. Many were irked by the 15% pay increase Murphy was awarded last year, taking her salary above \u00a390,000. Those involved include political advisers to shadow ministers, known as PADs. Parliamentary records show that 46 people have been issued with parliamentary passes to work in Corbyn\u2019s office \u2013 including Murphy and other senior party officers. Murphy acts as Corbyn\u2019s gatekeeper and enforcer, as well as providing political advice and moral support. She and Corbyn\u2019s other close aide, Seumas Milne, watched the 2017 general election results with the Labour leader at his Islington home. Some Labour MPs regard Murphy as one of the driving forces behind the Labour leadership\u2019s reluctance to embrace an anti-Brexit position. But the Guardian understands that staff involved in the dispute span the political spectrum within the party, and they insist they are concerned about pay and conditions, not politics. A Labour spokesperson said, \u201cLabour is in negotiations with our staff on a pay offer and we are awaiting feedback from our recognised unions on the improved and final proposal we have made. \u201cIt is entirely false to suggest that the staff intend to ballot their members on anything other than pay. Labour operates an open, Union-agreed process to allow staff to raise grievances, including against management. It is entirely false to suggest anyone has attempted to raise any grievance through the union agreed processes in relation to the Labour leader\u2019s chief of staff.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
