He joined the group in 1972, his bow strokes greatly contributing to the dynamics of their music. The albums Caledonia's Hardy Sons (1978) and So Many Partings (1979) turned them into folk heroes. In 1980, they played their first north American festivals, and Cunningham made the continent his base in 1981. Across the ensuing 20 years, he found his true niche, and a perception that his fiddle playing was all boisterousness and devil's trills was silenced by his later, more mature playing. This had been evident from the grace of his accompaniment on Norland Wind, on Cilla Fisher and Artie Trezise's Cilla &amp; Artie album, which was Melody Maker's folk album of 1979. Cunningham worked as a solo performer when it suited him, as with his Thoughts From Another World (1981) and Fair Warning (1984) albums. He also worked and recorded with ensembles, including a duo with his brother which resulted in Against The Storm (1980). Other collaborators included Relativity (with his brother, and Micheal O Dhomhnaill and Triona Ni Dhomhnaill, of the Bothy Band) and the Boston-based rock band Raindogs. Parallel with these projects, Cunningham produced records for such US acts as Cherish The Ladies and Solas. One of his crowning achievements was his score for the Peter Pan musical Peter And Wendy (1997), to which he contributed music, lyrics and fiddle. Cunningham was weaned on the music of the Beatles era. He took up the fiddle aged seven. When the folk bug bit - part of Scotland's postwar cultural resurgence - he was still a teenage boy wonder. He was to become part of a continuity that took in Highland piping, Shetland fiddling, Gaelic-language and waulking songs from Barra. His music transcended its origins while remaining true to its roots. He is survived by his partner Trisha McCormick, his mother, brother and sister. \u00b7 Johnny Cunningham, musician, born August 27 1957; died December 15 2003"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
