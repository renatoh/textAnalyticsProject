Last week on the Gold Coast, sweating it out in temperatures described as \u201c44 degrees\u201d by local colour men, the Tigers slaughtered the dumbfounded Titans, their colts James Tedesco and Luke Brooks having more fun than happy pants. The pair won\u2019t be afforded the same leeway this week against the Angry Burgess Brothers and the rest of the hard-faced Rabbits, indeed they will have their tender bits and faces rubbed, and quite roughly. Which should be good. Both sides sport thundering props, good halves, class hookers, and piss-fast wing men. But the Bunnies have Greg Inglis. And he dominates State of Origin much less a bunch of big baby cats. Saturday night special And so to a Saturday night special, a dinkum Derby at Remondis Stadium n\u00e9e Shark Park, between St George-Illawarra Dragons and Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. The former were plenty of pundits\u2019 spoon nominees yet remain undefeated after two rounds, such is the impossibility of tipping winners in this kooky National Rugby League. The Sharks were (pending the machinations of the drugs in sport imbroglio that\u2019s been around longer than the Devil\u2019s Marbles) a Top-8 moral but without their best players \u2013 Paul Gallen and Luke Lewis, to name but two \u2013 the Dragons will roast these Sharks in their own park, take it to the bank via Centrebet*. *Do not do this. Beefcake wizards Sunday afternoon at Brookvale Oval sees the ageless (well, since 1967) clash of Sydney\u2019s east (well, north) and west (actually, the geographic centre) as Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles entertain Parramatta Eels. Should be entertaining, especially if you\u2019re a Manly fan because you\u2019ll be able stand in the sun on Brookie Hill, drink a cold tinnie of the local brew \u201cNew\u201d, and yell rude things at an Eels side so bad they should be illegal. Perhaps not illegal. But they\u2019re still quite bad, Parra, and if Manly don\u2019t score 40 against them on a fine Sunday arvo at home they\u2019ll be searching for their very souls come training at Narrabeen Monday. Maybe not searching for their souls. In fact they\u2019ll probably be happy enough with the two points and tell their public they\u2019re \u201clooking ahead\u201d, \u201chopefully\u201d, \u201cmoving on\u201d, and \u201cyeah, definitely\u201d, in the way of the modern player, they say nothing these people, they are beefcakes hard-wired by political wizards. Blinking drones of evil Crowds are down in Penrith, they say, apparently half their members \u2013 season-ticket holders \u2013 don\u2019t actually exercise their rights and attend games. And it\u2019s something that confounds the local powers-that-be. Is it the weather? Is it because the team aren\u2019t travelling that flash? What is it about the \u201cgame day experience\u201d that isn\u2019t pumping the nads of the local populace? How about this: much of the funding of Penrith Panthers Rugby League Club comes from Panthers World of Entertainment, the mighty gambling palace adjacent to the football ground. The club has 1,000 poker machines into which members of the local community pour something like $91m in any given year. The club returns a tiny percentage of this income back to \u201cthe community\u201d by subsidising footy socks for local kids, and such forth. It\u2019s about 3%. But if the local community wasn\u2019t tipping the money into the poker machines in the first place, would they not have the money in their pocket? Would they then be able to attend games of local rugby league because a) they have the money and b) they\u2019re not playing the bloody pokies? Simplistic, sure. But pokies suck people in like hypnotised moths. And if the footy club could get half the people who pump money into the machines to attend games instead, they\u2019d fill their stadium every week. Plenty of Panthers\u2019 PR is about engaging the community. But these blinking drone machines suck the community dry. Clubs Australia has slick advertising assuring us that \u201cclubs are part of the solution\u201d to problem gambling. That\u2019s like saying \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d. Well, the gun \u2013 and the club \u2013 has a fair bit to do with it. Australians spend $12bn (billion!) a year on poker machines. You want to know why people aren\u2019t coming to the footy, Panthers? They\u2019re playing pokies in Panthers. Hot Milf And so to Canberra on a Sunday evening and a few reasons to tune in, but one that\u2019ll make you toss away the remote: the little man playing full-back, Anthony Milford. For if Wests Tigers fullback James Tedesco can make Gold Coast Titans look like lumbering, grasping, drunken farm oafs, then little Milfy will have them on their knees and howling at the moon in agony and angst. Watch him run! there hasn\u2019t been a set of flying feet like Milford\u2019s since bouncing baby-faced Innisfail Kid, Kerry Boustead. Last week Milford shredded Newcastle like a \u2026 shredder, one of those paper shredders. This week he\u2019ll so frighten the Titans they\u2019ll watch Evil Dead on the bus home to feel better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
