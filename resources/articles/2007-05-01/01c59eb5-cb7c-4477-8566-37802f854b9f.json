Yet it is soon evident that the amiable yet passionate 40-year-old, known by the dramatic nickname of White Lightning during the 72 Tests in which he opened the bowling for South Africa, craves the position on a permanent basis. \"When something is in your blood, like international cricket is to me, it can never be limited to five weeks or even five years. Working at cricket's very highest level is a lifetime passion for me and so this is a wonderful opportunity to get back where I belong. At this level of coaching you need to know how to manage your bowlers and, most of all, how to motivate and inspire them. I can do this with England.\" The implications for Kevin Shine, England's low-key and beleaguered current bowling coach, could be severe. \"I'll be working closely with Kevin,\" Donald says diplomatically. \"He will tell me what he wants doing, and where he needs help most, and I'll take it from there.\" But Donald does not need any prompting when asked if he would like to turn a brief consultancy into a full-time posting. \"Oh ja!\" he says at home in Bloemfontein, with the same blunt intent he showed when taking 330 Test wickets. \"Definitely! The ECB are testing the water but if everything goes well we'll see what they say. If they offer me something permanent I'll definitely take it.\" Since the departure of Troy Cooley, who coached a formidable attack which did so much to win back the Ashes in 2005, England's fast bowlers have looked in desperate need of direction, management and inspiration - the three key attributes Donald stresses. He is, again, disarmingly honest when asked if he hopes to assume Cooley's wide-ranging remit. \"I would - there's no doubt. At first this will be more a hands-on approach with the England team but Troy went round the counties and scouted talent and that would suit me perfectly.\" The ECB might insist that England's Test bowlers are still being instructed primarily by Shine - but even an hour in Donald's company is enough to make it easy to believe that his will be the dominant voice over the next five weeks. Despite last Saturday's destruction of the depleted West Indies in conditions ideally suited to Ryan Sidebottom, Donald is emphatic that recent lessons should not be forgotten. \"As surprised as I was by his selection, Sidebottom bowled beautifully. I'm really pleased for him because I knew Ryan as a toddler when I played club cricket in Bloemfontein with his dad [Arnie]. But we need to look at the wider picture because England have had lots of problems since winning the Ashes in 2005. \"Their intensity was the key to that series. But it's been lost and the real venom they had then has gone from England's bowling attack. No disrespect to the guys out there now, but you had a great quartet in 2005. Matthew Hoggard, a model of consistency who swings the ball, matched with Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones bowling at 140kph-plus. The Australian batsmen had not come up against an attack that pressurised them with such pace and aggression. \"England were desperate to win and I was really surprised they lost their venom so quickly. As soon as the Ashes ended they took their foot off the gas and instead of becoming the No1 team in the world they stagnated. I compare it to England wining the rugby World Cup. They were too busy patting themselves on the back rather than moving up another level. It was the same with the cricket.\" Harmison's decline epitomises an English malaise. \"Obviously [new England coach] Peter Moores is concerned his main strike bowler is not hacking it right now. It is a real concern - even if I was encouraged when watching Harmison at Headingley. He showed how he lifts the team when he gets a few wickets but we need him to start doing that in his opening spell. He needs more miles in his legs and some words in his ear about how good he is. I'm convinced that by the time India arrive in July he'll be firing.\" Donald believes that minor technical glitches in Harmison's action are being amplified by his own insecurity and the sheer weight of English expectation. \"In the first Test at Lord's he lacked rhythm and looked flat through the crease. When Harmison bowls well there's always a bit of air-time in his delivery. That pause in the air gives him the chance to get his left side through the crease with real impact. When I didn't get any air-time as a bowler I wasn't balanced at the crease and the ball snuck out of my fingers. I wouldn't get my wrist behind the ball and it's happening to Harmison. It's a small thing, technically, but I'm not sure how Harmison prepares with England. \"I watched him closely at Lord's. One morning he worked up a sweat in the nets and then he was out in the middle before play, tinkering away, before he ended up talking to Ian Botham, who gave him more advice. You should prepare calmly so you feel 100% sure you're in the zone. \"Of course England are always looking for Harmison to be the 'enforcer'. But, right now, the enforcer is not coming to the party. I saw that statistic of him not striking in the first spell and that was staggering [on the 92 occasions Harmison has been given the first new ball, he has failed to take a wicket 63 times]. If England can get him making inroads in his first five overs, even picking up a couple of wickets, that sets up a platform and frees his mind. He's been bowling well again for Durham but there are still doubts in his head at the highest level. He needs to relax and England should switch their focus - because I think Hoggard is the leader of the pack.\" One of Hoggard's most memorable days in Test cricket - when he took the first six South African wickets in an England victory in Johannesburg in 2005 - was motivated by Donald. \"Hoggy and I speak before every Test but I remember that particular match. He was anxious about playing at the Wanderers bullring for the first time and so I kept it simple and reminded him what a good bowler he is. I was just so chuffed because Hoggy's such a lovely bloke and we've got a real bond since playing together for Free State.\" It will be intriguing to see if Donald's influence with Moores will result in a one-day recall for Hoggard. \"I find it mind-boggling that England don't see him as a one-day bowler. Hoggard would make the white ball swing with absolute pleasure and I'm really baffled by England. Hoggard should be given a chance to show what he can do as a one-day bowler.\" Meanwhile Flintoff, in Donald's opinion, should be rested as much as possible this summer. \"Flintoff needs a complete mental and physical break. By the end of the World Cup he was shattered. Peter Moores is very sensible and great at strategising so I'm sure he will say to Flintoff, 'Listen, pal, you chill. At your best you are our most valuable player so just get your body right and your energy back because a fresh Flintoff is a brilliant Flintoff.'\" Among the younger English breed, Donald concentrates on four bowlers. \"I like Saj Mahmood. He's got real talent but he does need some fine-tuning so he becomes a more consistent threat. [Liam] Plunkett is pretty much the same - if not as quick. If you bring in Stuart Broad, along with [Jimmy] Anderson, then you've got an exciting crop of quicks. Broad and Anderson would be my first two choices - with Mahmood and Plunkett having the next most potential. They're the future but it was a shock when I first saw Broad. I used to look after him when he was a baby while his dad, Chris, captained Free State soon after my debut in 1985. I must be getting old when a toddler I held in my arms is on the verge of Test cricket.\" The plethora of English cricketing pros in an Afrikaner heartland in the mid-80s now has its most positive spin-off in Donald's friendship with Moores. \"Peter played club cricket for Welkom, down the road from Bloem, and I got to know him really well when he kept wicket to me in the Free State [provincial] side. He was into coaching even then and showed a natural flair for it. Twenty years on, I'm looking forward to getting stuck in with him for England. I'm really hungry to show everyone what I can do for the next five weeks and beyond.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
