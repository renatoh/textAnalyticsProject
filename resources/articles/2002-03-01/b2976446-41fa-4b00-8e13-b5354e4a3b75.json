Fly-on-the-wall documentary makers were ordered out of a school after the producer admitted posing as a 17-year-old student. Staff at Kingdown Community School in Warminster, Wiltshire ordered the film-makers off campus after discovering the cover-up, which had fooled teachers and staff alike for more than eight weeks. The production company, Talent Shed, was commissioned by Channel 4 to look at students returning to further education after a break. But at a meeting stunned staff were told that the subject of the film, a 17-year-old boy, was in fact the film's own producer. The headteacher, Sheelagh Brown, immediately ordered the film crew off the premises. A spokesman for Wiltshire County Council said the school had already complained to the head of Channel 4 and had been assured the show would not be broadcast. The broadcaster has promised to return all tapes of the documentary to the school, which is now taking legal advice with a view to reporting the network to the independent television commission. Channel 4 said today it was not a \"fake documentary\" because it knew the producer had gained access to the school posing as a school child. However, watchdogs are likely to take a very dim view of anything involving the filming of children without the consent of their teachers or parents. Last year the press complaints commission upheld complaints about a reporter on the London Evening Standard after he had gone \"undercover\" in a school posing as a teacher. The extraordinary incident comes three years after the fake-TV scandal involving Vanessa Feltz and hoax guests on her BBC show. Carlton TV was fined for The Connection, a documentary about drugs, which later emerged was faked in parts. And Channel 4 was seriously reprimanded by watchdogs after faking pictures for a documentary on rent boys in Scotland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
