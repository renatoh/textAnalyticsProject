The film-maker behind acclaimed indies Your Sister\u2019s Sister and Humpday has died from complications related to an \u201cunidentified blood disorder\u201d. Shelton was known as a leading figure of the independent film scene as well as an acclaimed television director, helming episodes of Glow, Mad Men, Master of None, Fresh Off the Boat, The Morning Show and, most recently, Hulu drama Little Fires Everywhere starring Reese Witherspoon. Her most recent film Sword of Trust was released in 2019. It starred Marc Maron, with whom Shelton was recently in a relationship with. She was said to be collaborating with him on a script that was set to be her next film. Shelton\u2019s work was often typified by female characters who avoided convention, such as Keira Knightley in Laggies (also known as Say When in the UK) and Edie Falco in Outside In. \u201cI didn\u2019t start directing feature films until I was 39,\u201d she wrote for the Guardian in 2014. \u201cAnd though, on paper, I\u2019m now pretty conventional \u2013 I have a mortgage, a son and a long-standing marriage \u2013 at 49, I get to live the life of an artist. My husband is the primary carer for our child. I feel I\u2019ve been able to be true to myself. Mark Duplass, who starred in a number of her films, paid tribute on Twitter. \u201cWe lost our dear friend Lynn Shelton,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe made so many things together. I wish we had made more. Her boundless creative energy and infectious spirit were unrivaled. She made me better. We butted heads, made up, laughed, pushed each other. Like family. What a deep loss.\u201d Comedian Mike Birbiglia, who had a small role in Your Sister\u2019s Sister, called the news \u201cdevastating\u201d and wrote: \u201cI learned about directing from watching her. The kindness with which she treated people. The room she left for spontaneity. We\u2019ve lost a great one.\u201d Shelton is survived by her 21-year-old son Milo. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2020. Lynn Shelton\u2019s son is 21, not 13 as an earlier version mistakenly said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
