The organisation Sikh Tories released a statement on Twitter to say the comments made by Philip Dunne, the party\u2019s candidate in Ludlow, Shropshire, were offensive and unacceptable. However the Conservatives are facing criticism for not taking action over the incident, despite promises by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, that anyone in the party who has shown prejudice or discrimination is \u201cout first bounce\u201d. Sikh Tories said: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the offensive remarks made by Philip Dunne at the Ludlow hustings. These comments are simply unacceptable. \u201cWe recognise he has already apologised, and hope he and others will consider their words before referring negatively to the Sikh crown in future.\u201d Sikh Labour politician Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who is campaigning to be returned as MP for Slough, said Dunne\u2019s comment was racist and called for his suspension. He repeated Johnson\u2019s pledge that he would kick out members of the party found making such remarks at \u201cfirst bounce\u201d. Singh Dhesi, who is the first MP to wear a turban, said: \u201cBoris Johnson is sending the message that it\u2019s OK to be racist towards British Sikhs and openly humiliate us in public forums. Philip Dunne should be immediately suspended from the Conservative party and stripped of the honour the Tory leadership gave him this year.\u201d Dunne, who is seeking re-election as the MP for the Shropshire constituency, made his comment to Labour candidate Kuldip Sahota during a debate in a local church on Wednesday evening. They clashed over education budgets, according to people there. He is said to have apologised at the end of the debate when he was told by Sahota that the remarks were offensive. Dunne released a statement on Thursday: \u201cI apologised to Kuldip Sahota for my comments. I apologise again unreservedly for the offence caused.\u201d Sahota, the former leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said the remark was reminiscent of the offensive comments he received in the 1970s. The Conservatives did not comment on whether there would be an investigation into Dunne, who has held the seat since 2005. He is a former health and defence minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
