But, for all the momentary power of an evening that takes the form of a compressed triptych, I was left simply with a feeling of impotent disquiet. Each of three elliptical episodes shows two people at a moment of crisis. In the first, set in a farmhouse on land supposed to be razed for the third runway, we watch a foster mother bid farewell to a surrogate son she loved with a dangerous possessiveness. Things turn edgier in the next scene, set in a plush airport hotel, where an art teacher finds himself tested by a married woman police officer who craves sadomasochistic sex. Finally, Stephens takes us underground into a deserted warehouse where a nervous man is interrogated by a younger woman who trades in child-trafficking, though whether for sexual or adoptive purposes is left ambiguous. Stephens cunningly links the three scenes: the Habanera from Carmen recurs, and the steely child-slaver turns out to be a product of the foster home referred to at the beginning. The internet is also a common factor, functioning as a conversation-killer, a source of hotel porn, or a means of pursuing our darkest, illegal desires. But it is hard to see what Stephens is telling us beyond the fact we inhabit a heartless, dehumanised world where sex is commodified and children are subject to various forms of abuse. He offers us snapshots of individual cruelties that, for all the suggestion of larger forces at work, don't add up to a social critique. We may be disturbed; but what are we meant to do about it? Katie Mitchell directs with her meticulous precision. Lizzie Clachan's design ingeniously embraces three radically different settings. And the acting is extremely good. Linda Bassett and Tom Sturridge as the quasi-incestuous foster mother and her fugitive charge; Paul Ready and Jo McInnes as the erotically fencing couple in the hotel; and Angus Wright and Amanda Hale as the dodgy child-seeker and the intimidating trafficker do everything required. But where a dystopian play like Caryl Churchill's Far Away used domestic terror to imply a universe on the edge of the abyss, Stephens's triptych offers isolated existential choices. Like the fat boy in Dickens, Stephens wants to make our flesh creep; but, in the end, that isn't quite enough. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 April 2011. The original referred to Wastwater as the deepest lake in Britain. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
