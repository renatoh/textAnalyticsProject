The neon-yellow kit worn by Lionel Messi and his team-mates was an apt colour for a team who shone. Every question they asked of City was unanswerable during those opening 45 minutes. City deserve credit for fighting back in the second half but two days after Messi and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 were photographed near midnight outside a casino their side\u2019s display was so brilliant that one had to be reminded that City are the English champions. Bar\u00e7a\u2019s play was, simply, the stuff of fantasy for long periods. On this showing the Premier League is schoolboy fare. Maybe English football should spend a few nights at the casino. 2) City miss Tour\u00e9 but even he would have struggled Manuel Pellegrini decided to replace the suspended Ivorian, the team\u2019s talisman, with James Milner, a player who has been bursting to operate in the central midfield role which took him to City from Aston Villa, where he had been outstanding in the position. Milner\u2019s first contribution was to float a 20-yard ball into Edin Dzeko\u2019s path for City\u2019s opening foray and in Tour\u00e9\u2019s absence he later took a free-kick won by Sergio Ag\u00fcero, though this came to nothing. Not for the first time, though, Fernando, his partner for the evening, proved suspect, playing one back pass into Luis Su\u00e1rez to allow him to run at Joe Hart\u2019s goal. Later, Milner fired in a pass but Samir Nasri passed up the chance. But so good were Barcelona that even Tour\u00e9 would have struggled on this night. 3) Pellegrini backs bold words in team selection but City suffer The uber-calm Chilean produced the most upbeat programme notes of his tenure as City manager, saying: \u201cWe feel we can beat any side in the competition. We have already shown that by defeating Bayern Munich here in the group stages. If you can do that then why can\u2019t you beat Barcelona also? I am sure you will see us trying to play in the same way as we did against Newcastle United [in winning 5-0] and in the second half at Stoke City.\u201d For Pellegrini this is about as bullish as he gets and he proceeded to back his bold talk with a starting XI that featured two strikers, with Dzeko playing alongside Ag\u00fcero. If this was brave, by half-time it looked like high folly \u2013 Barcelona were 2-0 ahead and flying through two goals from Su\u00e1rez. Ag\u00fcero shows his class and makes presence felt In this most difficult of contests the Argentinian still managed to throw City a lifeline with the 69th minute goal created by a David Silva flick. Before this, Ag\u00fcero had warned Barcelona of how he could damage them. One illustration came when fooling Javier Mascherano with a shimmy to win a free-kick. Another when a second-half run had the visitors backpedalling before a 20-yard shot carefully watched by Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen. The man who played only 45 minutes in last year\u2019s tie due to injury had been impatient to face this gilded Bar\u00e7a side. \u201cThis is a new game and we\u2019re not the same as we were last season,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t either. Both teams have had reinforcements that have improved the squads.\u201d Ag\u00fcero ensured his presence was felt. 5) Bar\u00e7a keeper Ter Stegen given far too little to do During the first half when his colleagues were a blur of skill, invention and sheer majesty, Barcelona\u2019s 22-year-old goalkeeper could console himself that despite not yet experiencing a minute in La Liga for the club he joined last summer he is the No1 for the Champions League. Signed from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in a \u00a412m (\u00a38.8m) deal, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen plays second fiddle to Claudio Bravo in the weekly bread-and-butter stuff but what a consolation to be able to pull up the armchair to watch this team when on song. Last month he said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to be at Bar\u00e7a but the situation is difficult.\u201d Ambition is great but apart from picking the ball out of the net after Ag\u00fcero struck, Ter Stegen had little else to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
