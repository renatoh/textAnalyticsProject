But in pledging all PVH's assets \"for the benefit of the families of the Longbridge workforce\" the infamous Phoenix four are presenting themselves as having made an important public act of contrition. The basis for shame is clear enough. If the four businessmen who bought Rover from BMW for \u00a310 five years ago had arranged their corporate interests in a more standard fashion from the outset - avoiding the impression that they were stripping Rover of its assets and depleting their main operating business of much needed investment - then the last British-owned volume car manufacturer might not now be at death's door. Whatever the external factors (the strength of sterling, huge over-capacity in the motor industry generally), it was a bloody-minded commitment to financial opacity which eventually brought Rover down. It is also worth noting the lunacy of the situation on Sunday, whereby the government felt obliged to provide some \u00a36.5m of emergency funding for Longbridge at a time when Rover's parent still had its own liquid resources. Magnanimity is something we can't really comment on, other than observing that it's a pretty rare quality in the world of modern business. The threats facing the Phoenix four, meanwhile, range from the real possibility of a full colour Department of Trade inquiry to the unmeasured hole in Rover's pension fund. Every pension expert seems to agree that PVH, as Rover's parent, carries direct liability for that shortfall, which will now be crystallised by the move into administration. So on this level at least, the Phoenix offer of resources to the administrators is meaningless since PVH was in effect bankrupted by Rover's failure. Easy target Non-executive directors are an easy target for the press. They are invariably presented as white, middle-aged grandees who shuffle in for the occasional boardroom meeting, nod through the agenda, tuck into a decent lunch and then pick up a cheque for \u00a310,000. The white and middle-aged bit is pretty unarguable. But since the Higgs report on corporate governance in 2003 multiplied their workload and bestowed on them bewildering new responsibilities, pity is probably more appropriate than envy or disdain. And pity is what many will today feel for the former non-executive directors of Equitable Life. The dossier issued yesterday by the insurer to support its multimillion pound negligence case against nine former non-executive directors of the society makes terrifying reading. In a step-by-step rebuttal, it comprehensively demolishes arguments likely to be used by non-execs if a company collapses during their watch. \u00b7 Can non-execs be held responsible if the scene was set for disaster before they were appointed? Yes, says Equitable. If directors have inherited a problem, their duty is to avert or mitigate the disaster. \u00b7 Can they be blamed when they rely on professional guidance given by experts on the board? Yes, the job of the non-exec is to ask the right questions. \u00b7 Can they be pursued for damages in the absence of fault on their part? Bad luck again. Even if there were an absence of fault, Equitable argues that a non-exec may still be in breach of fiduciary duty and liable to make good any resulting losses. \u00b7 Can they be pursued even if the blame lies with external factors such as a court ruling? Yes, directors should take precautions against the risk of the company losing a court battle. \u00b7 Can they simply argue that they did their job honestly and reasonably? No, you can't even play this as a get-out-of-jail free card, says Equitable. It adds that it is also irrelevant if the director doesn't have much in the way of assets to be seized. If Equitable Life's action is successful, its former non-executive directors will be personally ruined - so too will the prospects for quality candidates to join Britain's boardrooms. The risks will far outweigh the rewards. Post-Higgs there was much talk of a legal cap on the liabilities of non-executive directors. It didn't happen - but after the election it will be right to return to the subject. Pearson pressure Pressure is mounting on Marjorie Scardino, Pearson's chief executive, to do something about the company's poor share price performance and justify a corporate structure which is looking increasingly short of supporters. The charismatic Texan still has the backing of major institutional investors. But if Franklin Templeton, traditionally a reliable supporter of incumbent managements, is grumbling then that backing cannot be relied upon indefinitely. Pearson says 2005 will be a crunch year, with an upturn expected in the US education market. Ms Scardino regrets her comments that the FT would be sold over her dead body. But she must act soon to pull off a visible recovery in all parts of the group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
