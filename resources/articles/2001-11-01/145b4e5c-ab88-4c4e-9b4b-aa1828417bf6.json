Durnian, the overnight leader in the Seniors Tour Championship here at the PGA Golf de Catalunya course, had only to maintain that position to win the Seniors Order of Merit. But, seemingly beset by nerves, he was five over par after 14 holes, eventually salvaged a 74 but surrendered the title of European No1 to Australia's Ian Stanley. Durnian finished tied for third, three behind the winner, the American Jerry Bruner, who won for the first time as a senior, after being runner-up nine times in the last three years. Bruner had a final-round 68, for a total of 210, six under par. Called Mighty Mouse on the tour, the 5ft 6in Bruner hit a drive and sand wedge at the 18th, all 452 yards of it. The ball finished three feet from the pin and, as the American was preparing for his birdie putt, the leaderboard changed to show that the eventual runner-up, David Good from Tasmania, had birdied the 17th to go to five under. But Bruner, equal to the pressure, holed the putt and set about celebrating a win that was worth \u00a337,000. Durnian's tribulations were not unexpected. He was playing under the pressure not only of possibly winning the Order of Merit but also of getting into the Rest of the World team for the UBS Warburg Cup at Kiawah Island in North Carolina in two weeks' time. This event is a cross between a Presidents Cup and a Ryder Cup, with an international team playing the United States, with the winners being paid $150,000 (\u00a3107,000), the losers $100,000. To the modern successful golfer those are insignificant sums but to many a senior they are substantial. When, earlier this year, Durnian won the Wales Senior Open, with its \u00a380,000-plus first prize, his first reaction was to say: \"Thank goodness I'm not in debt any more.\" A couple of failed business ventures had not helped. Durnian also had to contend with the awful memories of 1989, a season in which he played so well at the start of the season on the regular tour that he was measured up for a Ryder Cup outfit. It reached a point when he had only to make the cut in any one of six tournaments and he would have been in the team. But he missed them all and finished only 23rd in the Order of Merit that year. His career went into freefall, his finishing positions in the next three years being 79th, 114th and 205th. \"To get into the Warburg team,\" he said, \"is some compensation for missing out all those years ago.\" He was also one of 11 players on the tour to make more than \u00a3100,000 this season, Stanley setting a new record with \u00a3178,460, some \u00a36,467 ahead of Durnian. The Hardys Super Seniors prize for the over-60s went to Tommy Horton, who finished jointly third. It was a bittersweet moment for him in that it marked the first time since he joined the tour that he had not won a tournament overall. But maybe the real super senior of the event was in any case Neil Coles, who on Saturday went round in 67, at the age of 67 - the first time he had equalled his age in competition. A 73 yesterday on this 6,866-yard course dropped him out of the top 10 but he remains the only golfer in history to have won a major professional event in six different decades. He was asked why it had taken him so long to equal his age and replied rather indignantly: \"I've only been 67 for a month.\" A listening David Huish reassured him, though. \"Don't worry, Neil,\" he said, \"it gets easier for the next 13 years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
