The England head coach had spent his afternoon deliberating with the general manager, Franco Baldini, over the make-up of the England squad for next week's friendly in France. Having then braved the rush-hour crawl down the Seven Sisters Road, he must have hoped his evening would offer pointers as to his starting line-up at the Stade de France. A league flooded with players from every corner of every continent had provided a collision of two sides boasting nine England players between them at the kick-off. Each had cause to hope they would make the Italian's provisional 30-man squad to be announced this lunchtime. If Capello was wavering on some, keen to assess them first-hand, then this was a timely opportunity for them - although in practice it was no occasion to provide a rational judgment. Rather, as an introduction to the ferocity of a Premier League derby, it must have taken Capello's breath away. One first-half incident summed up the frenzy. Nearing the interval, Ashley Cole leapt into a challenge on Alan Hutton within feet of the home dugout, the left-back missing the ball as it skipped up off the turf and crunching high into the Scot's right shinpad. The reaction from Spurs' coaching staff was instantaneous and livid, Gus Poyet springing from his seat to confront the Chelsea player as Hutton writhed on the turf. In the melee that ensued, with players squaring up to one another, even the normally placid Avram Grant had to be restrained as he remonstrated. The yellow flashed by a panicked Mike Riley provoked howls of disbelief. \"That's a red and you know it,\" screamed Poyet at the fourth official, Steve Bennett, who had been within feet of the incident. The Uruguayan sought out Cole as the players departed a few minutes later, berating the full-back with one arm draped threateningly round the Chelsea player's neck while the left-back blanked him and shook his head. John Terry, having spied that altercation, charged after the pair down the tunnel. Henk ten Cate scurried after them all. Capello, watching in the stand, must have been dumbstruck. Welcome to the Premier League's crazy world of tunnel scraps and touchline rucks. Cole could count himself fortunate still to be involved in the second half. This was a spiteful helter-skelter, the memory of last month's Carling Cup final still simmering. Capello is used to club management but will be aware that his England players will be tearing into one another before the World Cup qualifiers in the autumn. Of the nine candidates who started, Jermaine Jenas departed by the interval, possibly as a result of a sliding challenge on the edge of the centre circle - deemed legal - performed by Frank Lampard moments before the Cole controversy. Jenas had set up Tottenham's first equaliser, taking his time to find his range with a series of free-kicks before finding Jonathan Woodgate at the far post, the centre-half leaping above Didier Drogba yet again to thump in his second for the club. He has a liking for Chelsea's otherwise stingy defence. Yet if that was a moment of clarity amid the fury, picking out the calm heads was more problematical. Capello will have been worried by Terry's inability to rise in aerial challenge as Dimitar Berbatov scored the home team's second, but impressed by the lofted pass sumoned by the centre-half to supply Drogba with his first league goal of the year. Paul Robinson's absence as that cross looped into the middle will also have raised eyebrows. Then there was Joe Cole's quick-footed dart through muddled defenders - including English defenders - and slipped pass for Michael Essien to stab a lob over Robinson to restore the lead. It was this Cole who caught the eye most consistently. He was outstanding, his superb goal after skipping across the area and away from Pascal Chimbonda, the ball clipping Robinson's leg and spinning in, having edged Chelsea further towards a win, and his even better second almost securing it again. The midfielder's wonderful recent form demands inclusion for club and country. For Robinson this was painful at times. The goalkeeper had been troubled by an ankle injury in the build-up and is aware that Juande Ramos is looking for replacements, and the Chelsea fans were bellowing \"England's No4\" in his direction long before the end. Capello will have made up his own mind. This game will have opened his eyes to the brutal entertainment offered up by the English game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
