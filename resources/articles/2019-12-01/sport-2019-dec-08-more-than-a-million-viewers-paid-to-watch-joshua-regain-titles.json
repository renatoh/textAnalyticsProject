Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, said: \u201cWe are waiting on the final number but it has almost certainly broken the UK pay-per-view record.\u201d The 30-year-old Joshua earned about \u00a360m for his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight rematch with the Mexican-American Andy Ruiz Jr, a record fee for a British athlete for a single sporting event. However, his decision to fight in Riyadh led to considerable criticism from Amnesty International, which warned he was being duped by a Saudi regime with an \u201cabsymal\u201d human rights record that included the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Human rights organisations have also warned about heavy restrictions on freedom of expression and women\u2019s rights, as well as the use of the death penalty for offences not recognised as crimes under international law. The heir to the Saudi throne, Mohammed bin Salman, has denied any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s murder, calling it a \u201cmistake\u201d and \u201ca heinous crime\u201d by his country\u2019s agents. Crown Prince Mohammed, who runs the country on behalf of his father, was at the fight on Saturday and was fist-pumped by Joshua after his victory. Hearn, who hailed the fight as a massive success, confirmed the exchange afterwards. \u201cHe did a fist-pump to Joshua, and he did a fist-pump back,\u201d said Hearn. \u201cI spoke to the Saudi sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, afterwards. They just feel like it was a massive moment for the country.\u201d Speaking last night, Joshua said he did not mind the pressure he faced from human rights groups to speak out, but he felt unable to do so because he was not aware of all the issues. \u201cIt\u2019s good people ask me the questions \u2013 they want to hear my view about it,\u201d he added. \u201cI think you guys have made me more aware of the issues. I swear the fight was my main focus but that will change. I thought I was going to see some serious stuff going on \u2013 you would expect that from what you hear about Saudi \u2013 but I can only go on what I have experienced.\u201d Hearn also insisted that it was unfair to single out Joshua for criticism when so many other athletes were coming to Saudi Arabia, including ATP tennis players this week, Spanish football stars in January and the world\u2019s top cyclists a month later. \u201cWe have said all along that all these sports are coming here and yet you guys are writing articles criticising Joshua but not other people,\u201d he said. \u201cTyson Fury came here three weeks ago to make money for doing a WWE wrestling event, not a proper sporting event.\u201d Joshua is likely to fight next in England, with a fight at Tottenham\u2019s new 60,000-capacity stadium in either April or May, with the IBF champion Kubrat Pulev the preferred option. \u201cI\u2019m getting more and more experienced, understanding myself, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cEven though I took my loss [against Ruiz], I had to learn, didn\u2019t I? I didn\u2019t lose heart. I\u2019m back again, I\u2019m learning. And we\u2019re going to get back into the gym. I\u2019m going to go to Sheffield [his training camp] early, and just keep practising my skills. \u201cI need to stay active and have the hunger to learn,\u201d he continued. \u201cI took my loss to Ruiz in June and got my belts back, and here we go again. I have to defend my titles.\u201d Saudi Arabia has announced that it will host a ranking snooker event in Riyadh for the first time after signing a 10-year deal with World Snooker. The Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters will take place from 4-10 October next year, with prize money of \u00a32.5m. The champion will receive \u00a3500,000, the same amount as the winner of the sport\u2019s World Championship. \u201cThis is a giant leap forward for our sport,\u201d said World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn, Eddie Hearn\u2019s father. \u201cSnooker has grown to such an extent that we are now creating exceptional tournaments at this level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
