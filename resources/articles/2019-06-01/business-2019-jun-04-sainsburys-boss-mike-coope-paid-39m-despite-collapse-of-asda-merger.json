Mike Coupe\u2019s total pay increased to nearly \u00a33.9m, as his annual bonus rose nearly 40% to \u00a3593,000, according to the company\u2019s annual report. Coupe was widely mocked last year when he was filmed singing We\u2019re in the Money, from the musical 42nd Street, while waiting to be interviewed on ITV about his plan to merge Sainsbury\u2019s with Asda. The merger has since been blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority on the grounds that it would reduce choice and raise prices. Coupe recently revealed Sainsbury\u2019s had paid \u00a346m for professional advice on the abortive deal. The supermarket chain has also faced controversy over pay changes for thousands of ordinary shop workers whose annual bonus payouts were scrapped. Coupe received the payout because he had met minimum profit and personal targets, including the integration of Argos and \u201ccontinuing development of business strategy\u201d, said Sainsbury\u2019s. He also received \u00a3289,000, 30% of his salary, to put towards his pension and a \u00a3582,000 deferred share award, although that was down from \u00a3758,000 a year before. The supermarket\u2019s chief financial officer and director, Kevin O\u2019Byrne, and the Argos chief executive, John Rogers, both received annual bonuses of more than \u00a3300,000 and deferred share awards of more than \u00a3300,000, taking their total pay to more than \u00a32.2m each. The payouts came despite Sainsbury\u2019s reporting a 42% drop in profits to \u00a3239m, as sales at established stores slipped by 0.2%. Sainsbury\u2019s remuneration committee said it was \u201ccomfortable with the bonus outcomes, particularly when the broader context of the retail market performance is considered\u201d. Coupe\u2019s pay is less than the \u00a34.6m received by the bosses of both the much larger Tesco and the smaller Morrisons. The row over the pay changes for thousands of ordinary Sainsbury\u2019s workers was prompted when the company said it was investing \u00a3110m in a pay rise for 93% of its 130,000 shop workers, taking pay from \u00a38 to \u00a39.20 an hour, or \u00a39.80 in London, to give an average pay rise of 9.3%. However, the removal of paid breaks, an annual bonus and Sunday and bank holiday pay meant 7% of staff, or about 9,000 people, experienced an average pay cut of \u00a3400 a year. The supermarket has said it would make up the difference in their pay for 18 months and pledged to review its policy in March 2020. Bev Clarkson, national officer for the food industry at the Unite union, which has considered legal action about Sainsbury\u2019s pay changes, said: \u201cMike Coupe\u2019s mammoth payday is another example of top corporate bosses skimming the cream off the top, while the pay of those hardworking staff at the frontline making the profits is continually squeezed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
