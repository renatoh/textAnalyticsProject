Analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests that private sector wages rose at an annual rate of up to 3.6% in the three months to August, due to rising wages and flat living costs. That would be the fastest growth since 2001 if it is confirmed in official figures to be published on Wednesday. Across the economy as a whole, once the squeezed public sector workers are included, pay is expected to show growth of up to 3%, according to the thinktank\u2019s research. Households\u2019 earning power stagnated in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and the deep recession that followed, in what the TUC called the longest squeeze on living standards since Victorian times. But outside of the public sector, where a Treasury-imposed pay freeze continues, stronger economic growth appears to have improved employees\u2019 bargaining power, just as plunging global oil prices have brought inflation down to zero. Laura Gardiner, a senior policy analyst at the foundation, said: \u201cWorkers across the UK are enjoying a much-needed mini-pay surge after a painful six-year squeeze. And while much of this growth is down to historically low inflation, there are welcome early signs too of a shift towards higher-paid job creation that could boost pay still further.\u201d Economists, including the Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, have blamed recent weakness in wage growth partly on the make-up of the workforce, with a disproportionate number of new jobs since the crisis created in low-skilled, low-wage sectors such as hospitality and retail. Broadbent in a recent speech: \u201cDuring 2014, for example, it\u2019s the fact that new jobs went to people with below-average qualifications and experience, and in lower-paid occupations, that depressed average pay growth.\u201d However, the foundation analysis suggests that the balance has shifted more recently towards higher-paid, managerial roles. This effect will tend to boost average pay, although the thinktank warns that most of the benefits will be felt by older, more qualified workers. Gardiner added that the \u201ccatch-up\u201d rates of real wage growth that are starting to undo the impact of the long pay squeeze may be difficult to maintain once inflation returns. \u201cSecuring a sustainable period of strong employment and pay growth will require a renewed focus on jobs quality, skills, investment and productivity,\u201d she said. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the prediction of a recovery in wages was welcome; but pointed out that many workers, including those in the public sector, have not been able to benefit. \u201cAfter a long wait, it\u2019s good news that many workers are finally seeing real pay improvements. However, earnings remain some way off their pre-crash position, too many self-employed workers are stuck at the bottom, and there is no public sector pay recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is not delivering the sustainable pay growth working people need\u201d. The British chancellor, George Osborne, made boosting wages for the low-paid the centrepiece of his July budget, announcing a new \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which will boost the statutory minimum rate by 50p an hour, to \u00a37.20 for the over-25s from April, rising to \u00a39 an hour by 2020. Some firms have protested against the change, with the director-general of the CBI business lobby group describing it as a \u201cgamble\u201d. Anti-poverty campaigners are also angry that deep cuts to tax credits will more than outweigh the promised pay rise for many families. However, Osborne hopes that by pushing up wages at the bottom of the income scale, he can persuade firms to invest more in equipment and training, boosting productivity. The Treasury said: \u201cThe government is determined to move Britain from a low-wage, high-tax and high-welfare economy to a higher-wage, lower-tax and lower-welfare economy. And today\u2019s report by the Resolution Foundation is further evidence that our economic plan is working.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
