The Liechtenstein football federation has until 11am today to provide guarantees to the European governing body after a Uefa delegation visited the principality yesterday to review security arrangements. The visit was hastily convened after the Liechtenstein federation expressed concerns about the possibility of anti-war demonstrators travelling to the match in Vaduz and disrupting security arrangements. Yesterday the police and the football authorities said they were unable to guarantee the game would go ahead as scheduled. The match is already the subject of the biggest security operation in Liechtenstein's history. The Rheinpark Stadium only holds 3,500 spectators and England have been given only 1,000 tickets. There are already concerns that segregation for the match has broken down with England fans buying tickets in the area of the ground reserved for home fans, and rumours of forged tickets are circulating. Austrian and Swiss police will augment the local force of just 70 full-time officers, and British police spotters will also be present. The authorities in Vaduz, however, are concerned that should anti-war demonstrators decide to use England's appearance as a rallying point they may be overwhelmed. More than 30,000 people demonstrated against the conflict in Iraq in Berne, Switzerland, on Saturday and there were minor clashes with the police. There is also a significant Kurdish population in Switzerland and Austria. Stephan Gst\u00f6hl of the Liechtenstein police said yesterday that the outbreak of war had meant the authorities were reviewing their plans. \"We are still analysing what affect it will have on our arrangements,\" he said. \"I cannot say whether the game will definitely go ahead.\" Mike Lee, Uefa's director of communications, did not rule out the possibility of the match being switched to an alternative venue - probably Grasshoppers' Hardturm Stadium in Zurich - or a postponement. Lee said Uefa must now be convinced that the federation and the authorities can guarantee the safety of England players, staff and supporters. \"We are demanding that these guarantees be met.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
