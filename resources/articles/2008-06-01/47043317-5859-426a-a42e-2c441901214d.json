Set to the music of the Pulcinella suite by Igor Stravinsky, the as-yet untitled piece will be performed by eight dancers from Wheeldon's own outfit, Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company, which is based in New York and London. It will be performed at Sadler's Wells in September. The Pulcinella suite, which premiered in 1920 with a set design by Pablo Picasso, was commissioned by the ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who set up the legendary Ballet Russes and helped launch Stravinsky's career. It follows the thwarted romances of two couples and ends with their marriages. The clothes and set design for Wheeldon's project are by fashion designer Isabel Toledo and her husband, artist Ruben. Their work, says Wheeldon, \"is screaming out to be put on stage\". The Yeovil-born choreographer hopes his work will form part of a full lineup of Stravinsky's work: \"It is the centenary of the Ballet Russes next year and I would love to make a full Stravinsky programme. I'm sure a lot of people will celebrate it but I'm getting a head start by beginning this year.\" Also being shown at Sadler's Wells in September is a new commission from former Ballet Frankfurt dancer Emily Molnar, and three shorter new works by Wheeldon, who will be conducting a ballet workshop for the public."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
