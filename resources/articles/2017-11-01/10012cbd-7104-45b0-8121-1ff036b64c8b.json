However, Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, warned that his company\u2019s efforts to clamp down on foreign interference in elections could damage future profits. \u201cWe\u2019re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said. Facebook, Twitter and Google have been under increasing pressure to identify and disclose the ways state-backed Russian operatives exploited their platforms through advertising and divisive political messaging and all three were summoned to testify before Congress this week. \u201cWhat they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it,\u201d Zuckerberg said in reference to the Russian ads as he opened the earnings call with an unusually impassioned statement. \u201cOur community continues to grow \u2026 and we saw good results in the business \u2026 but none of that matters if our services are used in a way that don\u2019t bring people closer together \u2013 or if the foundation of our society is undermined by foreign interference. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the same intensity to these security issues that we brought to any adversary or challenge that we\u2019ve faced,\u201d he said. To achieve that goal, Facebook plans to invest in doubling the number of people (mostly contractors) working on safety and security from about 10,000 to 20,000 in the next year. Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, David Wehner, said that expenses would go up 45% to 60% in 2018 to pay for improved security, an expanded video offering and to fund big bets such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality. The company\u2019s quarterly costs and expenses were $4.9bn. The political controversy in the wake of the 2016 election did not cause advertisers to lose faith in Facebook in the last quarter, with profits jumping by 79%. Ninety-eight per cent of Facebook\u2019s quarterly revenue ($10.14bn) came from advertising, while an additional $186m came from \u201cpayments and other fees\u201d. The company disclosed that more online marketers were buying Facebook\u2019s ads to target messages at mobile internet users. Facebook\u2019s ability to precisely target digital ads at users based on their interests and other online behavior is so powerful that some lawmakers want to regulate its ability to sell political advertising out of fear that it could play a part in undermining the democratic process. Facebook turned over more than 3,000 ads to Congress as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and revealed that as many as 126 million Americans may have seen divisive Facebook posts created by Russian operatives. The company also announced measures to improve transparency around political advertising, including creating a searchable database of images and messages used in ads and information about how each one was targeted. Neither Zuckerberg nor the CEOs of Google and Twitter, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey, attended the congressional hearings. Instead, they were represented by their general counsels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
