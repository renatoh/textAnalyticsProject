Farah, Charlie Grice and Mukhtar Mohammed spent six weeks in a camp outside Addis Ababa this year but the British Athletics\u2019 performance director was keen to stress they were \u201cfully supervised\u201d, and the organisation is always reviewing events at their training camps. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly receiving information from the key bodies and pulling that together,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe camps and the time we spent out in Ethiopia are fully supervised, we always have our staff there, so we\u2019re really comfortable with what we do. We\u2019re not foolish that we\u2019ll just sit back and think that because we\u2019ve done it before that\u2019s what we\u2019ll always do. We\u2019ll pay attention to all the information and we\u2019ll make good decisions.\u201d His comments came a day after Solomon Meaza, the general secretary of Ethiopia\u2019s anti-doping agency, warned that a number of his country\u2019s athletes were under investigation for doping. Another Ethiopian-based athlete, the Swedish former world 1500m champion Abeba Aregawi, has also accepted a voluntary suspension after testing positive for a banned substance in January. Black was speaking after naming Greg Rutherford as the spearhead of a 23-strong squad for the world indoor championships in Portland, Oregon, in a fortnight\u2019s time. The reigning Olympic and world long jump champion joins a team who include Dina Asher-Smith, the holder of the British 100m and 200m records, the world championship silver medallist Shara Proctor and the Olympic high jump bronze medallist Robbie Grabarz. Rutherford missed the recent Glasgow indoor grand prix and British trials with minor tissue damage but Black is hopeful the long jumper will be fit. \u201cGreg travelled back to the US yesterday and he is going to see how he feels in the coming days,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut everything is indicating that he will compete.\u201d Lynsey Sharp, a European gold medallist over 800m, also has realistic medal prospects after a last-minute decision to travel to Portland. \u201cWe believe she can among the best in the world,\u201d Black said. \u201cShe is serious contender for medals at the world indoors and at the Olympics in Rio.\u201d One surprise is that Andrew Robertson, who set a lifetime best in finishing second behind James Dasaolu in the British trials, has been given the nod in the men\u2019s 60m ahead of Sean Safo-Antwi, who impressed throughout the winter but could only come third in Sheffield. Black is confident the British team will do well in Portland despite many of their star names deciding not to compete. Farah elected to skip Portland in order to run the world half marathon in Cardiff on Easter Saturday, while Ennis-Hill has missed the indoor season altogether. The 400m British champion Nigel Levine, the 60m hurdles champion Andy Pozzi and the 1500m champion Hannah England also declined selection in favour of concentrating on the outdoor season. \u201cThere have been some excellent performances during the indoor season and we are confident that many of those selected will be challenging for medals,\u201d he said. Black also confirmed every British athlete competing in Portland will have to sign an agreement that will see them forfeit the right to be selected ever again if they are found guilty of a serious doping offence. \u201cThe agreement for the clause has now been completed and it will go out in the normal correspondence we send out, with the other information, over the next 24 hours or so,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt\u2019s a common-sense piece of administration. We see it as a naturally occurring thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
