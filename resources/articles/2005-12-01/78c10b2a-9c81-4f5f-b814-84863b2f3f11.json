Dr Katrin Both told the Northern Territory supreme court that tests showing DNA found on handcuffs was 100m times more likely to have come from Mr Murdoch than anyone else \"pushed science to the limits\". The handcuffs were allegedly used to tie up Joanne Lees. Dr Both said she did not accept the scientific validity of the technique used to link the 47-year-old with the attack on Ms Lees and the alleged murder of Mr Falconio. Mr Murdoch, of Broome, Western Australia, denies murdering Mr Falconio and abducting and assaulting Ms Lees in the Australian outback on the evening of July 14 2001. Dr Both, a part-time scientist at the forensic science service in Adelaide, told the court, in Darwin, that she had \"a large number of concerns\" about the DNA technique used by Dr Jonathan Whitaker, a senior forensic scientist with the UK-based Forensic Science Service. \"I think it [the method] is very dangerous,\" she said. \"He's pushing science to the limits.\" However, during cross-examination by Anthony Elliott, prosecuting, she conceded that Dr Whitaker's results could have been independently verified had the defence counsel chosen to. She also said his \"negative controls\" were clear, which she agreed suggested that there were no spurious results. But she added that it was the acceptance of contamination in the negative controls that were the basis for her not accepting his work as a \"valid scientific method\". The jury has heard that Mr Falconio and Ms Lees were allegedly attacked after being flagged down by another motorist on the Stuart Highway, around six miles north of Barrow Creek, some 190 miles north of Alice Springs. Ms Lees, now 32, of Brighton, told police a gun was held to her head and she was tied up, with her hands behind her back, and put into the back of her attacker's vehicle before managing to escape. Mr Falconio, 28, of Huddersfield, has not been seen since the day of the attack, and his body has never been found. The court heard evidence that Mr Murdoch had a different build to that of a man pictured on security footage at an Alice Springs truck stop just hours after the attack. Professor Maciej Henneberg, the head of the department of anatomical science at the University of Adelaide, said he had analysed the CCTV footage and compared his findings with images of Mr Murdoch taken between 1995 and the present day. When Grant Algie, defending Mr Murdoch, asked the professor what he had found, he said: \"What I could tell was that the person of interest in the CCTV image and Mr Murdoch differed in their body build, and probably in their overall size and stature.\" Prof Henneberg, an expert in the variations in human body structure and an elected visiting fellow at Oxford University, said he disagreed with the forensic expert Dr Meiya Sutisno, who earlier in the trial said Mr Murdoch was the man in the footage. He said the film was of poor quality and it was \"impossible to tell\" the details of many of the features usually used for comparisons. \"I had no trust in the soundness of the reasoning behind the report,\" he told the court. During cross-examination by the director of public prosecutors, Rex Wild QC, the professor admitted Dr Sutisno had carried out further enhancement of the images, which he had not done. However, another witness, Professor Gale Spring, an associate professor for scientific photography at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, said the \"enhanced\" images were \"absolutely not\" reliable for analytical purposes. The judge told jurors to expect to begin their deliberations towards the end of next week, \"but perhaps more likely the week after\". The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
