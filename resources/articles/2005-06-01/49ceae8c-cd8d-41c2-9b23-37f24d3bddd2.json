At the moment of Dettori's despair, opportunity did not merely knock for McEvoy but positively forced entry through the door like a SWAT team. No more second-stringers for him this week. With little hesitation, Godolphin announced that their number two rider would step up to the top job for the most important and prestigious meeting in the British Flat season. The chances of top-flight animals like Dubawi or Shamardal in the St James's Palace Stakes this afternoon, and Doyen, last year's King George winner, in the Prince of Wales's Stakes tomorrow, are in the Australian's hands. This is despite the fact that jockeys like Jamie Spencer, who has been in excellent form since leaving Aidan O'Brien's yard and has ridden for Godolphin in the past, were fit and available. It is a display of confidence in McEvoy's abilities that the rider is eager to justify. \"To be thrust into this position is a dream come true, so it will be my biggest week in racing,\" McEvoy said yesterday. \"I've got some very good rides, on paper at least, and if I could come away with one winner from such a tough and competitive meeting then I'd have to be happy with that.\" A single winner is the least he can expect, though, if the betting on the top jockey over the next five days is any guide. A fortnight ago, McEvoy would have been a no-hoper. This morning he stands behind only Kieren Fallon in the list, and is no better than 3-1 to be the leading rider, despite never having partnered a winner at the meeting. He went close in the Royal Hunt Cup 12 months ago, when the rogueish Zonergem, a 33-1 chance, finished fast to take third place. Since his first visit to the Royal meeting, he has won the St Leger on Rule Of Law, thanks to one of the finest front-running rides in that Classic's long history, while a good week on the Knavesmire could eclipse even the excitement of winning the Melbourne Cup on Brew in 2000, when he was just 20 years old. \"I hope that I've learned a lot and improved a lot since last year,\" he says. \"I've always concentrated on progressing and getting better all the time, and that's not difficult over here, where you're always up against top professionals. \"I also know that I can rely on Frankie to help me as much as he can. We've been working with the horses since we were in Dubai in February, and we talk about them every day and bounce opinions off each other. I'll be able to ring him up and chat about all the races beforehand.\" The position of number two rider can be a frustrating one at times, but since his arrival in Britain at the start of last season, McEvoy has shown a gift for making the most of the opportunities that come his way. He steered Byron, a 16-1 chance, to victory at Glorious Goodwood last summer, ahead of Dettori's mount Kheleyf, the 9-4 favourite, and only last month took the Henry II Stakes on Fight Your Corner. In contrast to his winning ride in the Leger last year, McEvoy was almost last on Fight Your Corner as the 16 runners turned into the home straight at Sandown. Yet he found a clear path through a mass of horses and got up in the final strides, and punters who place their faith in him this week will have a cool, versatile and very talented young jockey on their side. \"I think Dubawi would probably be my best chance of the meeting, and he should give me a great ride in the St James's Palace Stakes, but I'm looking forward to all of it and I can't wait for it to start. \"There's a great tradition to Royal Ascot, just as there is to Melbourne Cup day at home, but apart from that the two events are completely different. Melbourne is louder, and you get every man and his dog there, while the Royal meeting has real racegoers, and I enjoy that side of it as well.\" Emirates Gold, who was Godolphin's first two-year-old winner of the year when he took a maiden at Newmarket last month with McEvoy in the saddle, will launch him on his way in the Coventry Stakes today. After that, the major chances will arrive one after another as McEvoy finds out how the other half lives. \"I'm the number two rider for Godolphin, so I suppose that situations like this are part of the job,\" he says, \"but I'm glad that they've entrusted me with all the rides. They could easily have put someone else in for a few of them. It's a great honour.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
