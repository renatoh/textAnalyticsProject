My father insures the box with Sky but the correspondence comes to me. When I handed my father the insurance renewal note, he said Sky had phoned him seven weeks earlier and taken his debit card details and \u00a329.99 quarterly charge. My parents are signed up to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) so had no suspicion this was a cold call which turned out to be from Got u covered Ltd. I called to cancel this policy, which was more expensive, but was told I had missed the seven-day cooling-off period. When I pointed out we were signed up to TPS, I was told to take it up with them because Got u covered \"paid a lot of money for these lists\". Got u covered denied telling my father that the call was from Sky and said at no time did he say he couldn't understand what was being said. It has offered an extra two months' free cover but I don't want to be insured by Got u covered at all. CF, St Albans, Herts Got u covered has appeared in this column before. To you, Got u covered blamed the outfit that provides its lists for wrongly including TPS members. But companies that instigate the calls, not the data provider, are responsible for ensuring they phone no one registered with TPS, however much they pay for the lists. To me, Got u covered agreed it was responsible and pointed out that it makes an average of 125,000 calls each month and its complaints to TPS have never exceeded 0.0016% which, it says, is nearly 0%. Actually, it makes the high point two complaints a month. Got u covered says it sponsors a phone questionnaire and collects data from the answers. People who answer \"no\" to the question \"Do you have a service agreement?\" are assumed to have no other service \u2013 which is what you would understand as insurance. It says it cannot know if people have a service with another company. It could ask. It has listened to your father's conversation and says the operator clearly stated who was calling and referred to the initial manufacturer's warranty that had expired. But that is not the insurance you buy from Sky and which had two months to run. You reported Got u covered to TPS which instructed the company not to call your father again. The Information Commissioner's Office, which enforces the law on unsolicited direct marketing, has also instructed the company not to contact people on the TPS list. The Direct Marketing Association confirmed it had about 30 TPS complaints against Got u covered. Got u covered has offered to delay the agreement you have paid for until the current one expires and add three extra months' cover. I doubt you will accept. Readers with complaints about satellite warranty providers should contact Consumer Direct which forwards them all to West Sussex Trading Standards, because the majority of providers operate in that area. West Sussex Trading Standards is aware of Got u covered.
