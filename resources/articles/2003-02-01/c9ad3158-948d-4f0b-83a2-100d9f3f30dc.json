The first half belonged to the Ibrox side and, aside from a Jean-Louis Valois free kick that was deflected wide, Hearts were little more than spectators. It was no surprise, therefore, that Rangers retired to the break a goal to the good. They had declared their intentions from the outset by grabbing the tie by the scruff of the neck and going close through Michael Mols twice and Ronald de Boer before making the breakthrough in the 27th minute. It was a clever build-up involving Arthur Numan, a Neil McCann cross, a header back by Fernando Ricksen and a simple finish from De Boer as the Hearts defence appeared mesmerised. Rangers maintained the momentum and Mols was denied by a good Tepi Moilanen save. It was all too much for Phil Stamp, who was booked six minutes from the interval for a foul on Mols. The interval failed to quell tempers and early in the second half Alan Maybury and Mols were spoken to. Then Ricksen was booked after 54 minutes for a foul on Stephane Mahe. The referee's words made little difference and four minutes after that both Steven Pressley and Mikel Arteta were shown yellow cards following a difference of opinion. All that interrupted the flow of proceedings, although when Rangers returned to purely football matters they once again picked up the pace, albeit without an end product. Hearts badly needed inspiration and after 65 minutes they looked to tall Canadian Kevin McKenna for it as he replaced Stamp, while Rangers' response was to send on Claudio Caniggia for Mols seven minutes later. It had all deteriorated badly, however, although the Tynecastle team certainly enjoyed more possession than they had without really looking like saving the match.
