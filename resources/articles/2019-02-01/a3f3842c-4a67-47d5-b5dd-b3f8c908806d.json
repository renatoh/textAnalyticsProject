The letter, signed by many of the most senior diplomats of the last 20 years, underlines concerns that British influence in the world will wane if the country leaves Europe\u2019s trading and foreign policy bloc. In a joint statement they write: \u201cAs former diplomats who have served around the world we have a clear understanding of what contributes to Britain\u2019s influence in the world. Our advice to Theresa May today is clear: we should not leave the EU when we have no clarity about our final destination. Instead we must use the mechanisms at our disposal, above all we must seek to extend the article 50 negotiating period.\u201d The signatories are headed by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former permanent representative to the EU and ambassador to the US, who, on Wednesday, declared his support for the People\u2019s Vote campaign for the first time. Other signatories include more familiar opponents of Brexit including Lord Kerr, the author of article 50, Lord Hannay, permanent representative to the EEC under Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government, and Lord Ricketts, the former ambassador to France and national security adviser to David Cameron. They write: \u201cOur country\u2019s national interest must always be paramount. The Brexit fiasco has already weakened the UK\u2019s standing in the world. We strongly advocate a change of direction before it is too late. It is clear that Brexit has turned into a national crisis. \u201cThere is no possible deal that will be a sensible alternative to the privileged one we have today as members of the EU with a seat at the table, inside the single market and customs union but outside the Euro[zone] and Schengen [area]. They add: \u201cThere is now, in addition to extending article 50, a powerful argument to go back to the people and ask them whether they want the negotiated Brexit deal or would prefer to stay in the European union.\u201d They warn: \u201cIf the prime minister\u2019s deal is passed in parliament it will not be the end of Brexit but will in fact mark the start of year upon on year of negotiation and renegotiation \u2013 truly a \u2018Brexternity\u2019 of endless uncertainty about our future for both citizens and businesses alike.\u201d Other signatories include Sir Roderic Lyne, UK ambassador to Russia (2000-2004), Christopher Prentice, ambassador to Iraq (2007-2009) and Italy (2011-2016), Sir Bryan Cartledge, ambassador to the Soviet Union (1985-1988), Sir Ivor Roberts, ambassador to tYugoslavia (1994-1997) and Italy (2003-2006), Sir William Patey, ambassador to Iraq (2005-2006) and Afghanistan (2010-2012), Sir Richard Dalton, ambassador to Libya (1999) and Iran (2003-2006), Sir David Warren, ambassador to Japan (2008-2012), and Dame Nicola Brewer, former high commissioner to South Africa (2009-2013). Many diplomats have expressed concern over Britain\u2019s future influence when the form of its foreign policy and defence relationship with the EU remains unclear. There is also concern that the UK is leaving the EU at a time when the second pillar of UK foreign policy \u2013 the transatlantic relationship \u2013 has been out into question by the \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy of Donald Trump."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
