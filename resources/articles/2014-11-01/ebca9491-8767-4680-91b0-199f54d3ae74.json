If you\u2019re a fan of Israel, Wales, Czech Republic or Malta I\u2019d wager you\u2019re pretty happy just now. Enjoy what remains of the evening and thanks for the emails/tweets. \u2018Night. Two early goals and a dominant performance from the Croats, who didn\u2019t really make the chances they should have given their surfeit of possession but missed a great one through Perisic at the end. Neither will complain, it\u2019s 10 points apiece now, although Italy\u2019s complete lack of ability to impose themselves on games will worry Antonio Conte. Sadly the main headlines and pictures you see will probably relate to the match\u2019s suspension around the 75-minute mark, which occurred after fireworks were thrown onto the pitch. Fortunately, they were back underway after about 10 minutes. We\u2019re into the second of three added minutes in Milan. Was that Croatia\u2019s big chance? Croatia create that man over at last and Perisic, running in at goal, shoots just wide with his left foot from a slight angle on the left. Just that Italy v Croatia game going on now. Five minutes to go plus stoppage time. If you\u2019re coming in late, remember that the game was suspended for a few minutes after fireworks were thrown onto the pitch from the crowd. Giving the Turks a glimmer or papering over some pretty huge cracks? The shock result of the night perhaps, as Malta clawed back a point and denied Bulgaria a win they really needed to keep in touch with the top three. What a result for Israel there. Three out of three and they top the group! A mountain to climb for the Bosnians now. They deserved it in the end and that\u2019s four out of four! No disaster for Iceland, although the Dutch are breathing down their necks now.... Iceland have three minutes\u2019 added time to salvage things in Plzen.... A consolation there from Samat Smakov, from the spot. Now, in much better news, the players have re-emerged in Milan and the game looks set to restart. Let\u2019s hope that is an end to the stupidity, eh? Serdar Aziz makes it three. In Plzen, and a match whose crowd all seem to like football enough to watch the game and keep it going on, Cech has had to save from point-blank range from substitute Gudmundsson from a second ball that followed a long throw. And has been for a few minutes. Fireworks coming down onto the pitch being the reason. The match was stopped, then restarted, but after yet another was thrown from the stands the referee, Bjorn Kuipers, sensibly called matters to a halt. Not really the smartest move by whoever in the stands has done this, with the away side playing very well in their biggest match of the group. Not very nice scenes on the terraces now either. This comes just a month after the Serbia v Albania stupidity and it\u2019s just a massive shame, really. And the referee has now called the players toward him, with missiles appearing to come down from the stand. Some of them are moving towards the tunnel, or the sidelines at least. Buffon remains in his area. Not playing any time soon here. Not a lot happening on the San Siro pitch, because off it there has been a huge emission of smoke and fireworks from the Croatian end and the match has been halted while visibility improves. Very close now from Vaclav Pilar, the Czech substitute, who was set up neatly by Rosicky. He curls just over; the Czechs have now had 16 attempts to Iceland\u2019s four. The Czechs, who have been very good in this half, are allowing Iceland a little more of the ball now but they\u2019re doing little with it. Might need another flash of genius from Gylfi Sigurdsson if anything more is to happen here. Still 1-1 in Sofia and 2-0 in Istanbul, by the way. About 17 to go. If I was a betting man, I wouldn\u2019t be giving Bosnia manager Safet Susic a lot longer in the position. A dire day for Bosnia, this, as Eran Zahavi runs through to slot under Begovic. Off the line in Plzen! Kari Arnason, of Rotherham, to the rescue after Halldorsson totally missed the ball and Kadlec headed towards goal. That would probably have put this one to bed. Graziano Pelle has just come on for Italy, Southampton fans. He\u2019s replace Simone Zaza. But hear the cautious words of our Croatian corro: Croatia, to prove the point, have made 401 passes to Italy\u2019s 193! Croatia are still dominating Italy but Perisic can\u2019t do much with a header from a Modric free-kick. Clear chances are scarce there at the moment. Then Gylfi Sigurdsson hits the post! He\u2019s been quiet but, as a long throw is headed out to the edge of the box, hits a clean, textbook volley through a crowd of players. It smacks the upright, hits Cech and goes to safety! So close to an immediate response there. An own goal! Plasil is sent to the left byline, cuts it back right into the foot off Bodvarsson and the ball pings away at an impossible angle....but straight for goal. It should still be saved by Halldorsson at his near post but he\u2019s caught cold and it comes off him, then the post, then squirms in! Nobody quite realises what has gone on for a moment. But the Czechs have really controlled things since half time, especially down that left hand side, and it\u2019s probably deserved. This time Krejci shows what he can do with a super spin on the left touchline to roll his defender, but again the delivery is poor. In Haifa, Asmir Begovic saves as Israel squander a five-on-three counter. Rob Marriott seeks to add some welcome atmosphere to matters: \u201cAs I sit here watching the game on Maltese TV, a still-warm evening with the gentle fwooshing of the waves against the cliffs providing a lovely soundtrack to the game, I\u2019d like to announce that a swell of excitement surged around the bay at Malta\u2019s equaliser from the spot. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t. However, I do get to write to the MBM and brag about being in Malta on a warm evening, rather than in the rain and cold of Blighty, so that more than makes up for the lack of cheering. And the local folk would have a good deal to cheer, as Malta have been playing rather better since a few minutes before half time and have deserved their goal.\u201d Croatia, who have never lost to the Italians, have made a confident start of their own in Milan and Mario Mandzukic has just hung in the air to head at Buffon. Lafata has a chance for the Czechs \u2013 he blocks Arnason\u2019s attempted ball up the pitch, sees the ball returned to him by the head of Rosicky and volleys wide on the stretch when he should at least hit the target. The pattern for the second half appears set in Plzen, the Czechs doing most of the attacking and much of it coming down the left. Bjarnason is booked for a foul just outside the area on that very flank, and Darida\u2019s near-post delivery is headed over by Sivok. This measures at least something on the Richter scale: Clayton Failla has equalised from the spot in Sofia! They probably won\u2019t come back from this. First salvo from Krejci in Plzen, but he takes the ball from Lafata and misses the target by a mile. He\u2019s not shown a lot of composure, the 22-year-old winger from Sparta Prague. That Italy-Croatia game will be running a tad behind the others as they played four minutes of first-half stoppage time. Bosnia have made two half-time subs in Haifa, bringing on Prcic for Everton\u2019s Besic and also Visca for Mujdza. Neither is a striker, because they don\u2019t have any strikers. Ok, time for the second halves now... Some obligatory pre-Auld Enemy sledging has been sent my way by Simon McMahon: \u201cOf course, after European Champions elect Scotland\u2019s thrashing of ROI on Friday, all other results are irrelevant, but it\u2019s nice to see the smaller nations like San Marino, Faroe Islands and England doing well ...\u201d Rise to it if you want, I don\u2019t care. Doom and gloom in Bosnia I have a bit of a weakness for Slaven Bilic but, still, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken this long for someone to get him in as a television pundit. Props to ITV. Icelandic language confirmation from Kari Tulinius: \u201cI\u2019m Icelandic and can give you the lowdown on \u2018\u00de\u2019, or thorn as it is called. The \u2018\u00fe\u2019 is indeed pronounced \u2018th.\u2019 Specifically like the \u2018th\u2019 in \u2018thick\u2019 or \u2018breath.\u2019 There\u2019s another letter, \u2018\u00f0\u2019, called \u2018eth\u2019, that\u2019s also pronounced \u2018th\u2019, but like the \u2018th\u2019 in \u2018this\u2019 or \u2018breathe\u2019.\u201d This is SO much more than a football MBM. It became practiced stuff from two seasoned international units. What crisis? Israel are the new Iceland (with 30 times the population). Sofia, so good. Oh dear, Iceland. That goal was the last action of the half. Oh, my. It\u2019s Damari for Israel, latching onto a pass through and scuffing a shot into the corner past Begovic. The Austria Vienna striker has put them in a great position! In first-half stoppage time! It\u2019s Kaderabek and it\u2019s not dissimilar to Iceland\u2019s goal as Pudil hooks back a seemingly-wayward free-kick from the byline and in steams the Sparta Prague defender to head into the right-hand corner! That Israel goal, by the way, took a big deflection off Emir Spahic having looked again. Croatia are having a lot of the play as time ticks down towards the interval in Milan. But they\u2019re finding it hard to get too near to the goal as Italy defend the edge of the box well, and Ivan Rakitic has just slashed well wide from a distance. Iceland nearly make it two! Bjarnason plays Sigthorsson in and he should maybe score, but is tackled by Kaderabek and the ball dribbles wide! From the corner a header from Arnason is glanced wide too. Then at the other end Dockal crosses from the right and Lafata climbs to head not too far off target. Goals in all five matches already. Don\u2019t say we never spoil you. Gil Vermouth might just be allowed some of the strong stuff later! He received the ball on the edge of the area, was allowed a startling amount of time and space to turn despite almost getting the ball caught between his feet, and thudded a shot past Asmir Begovic! Iceland do look a good unit. \u201cMethodical\u201d might be the word. They are having to defend a lot now but when they do get possession it\u2019s handled with care. Which is what Halldorsson was just asked to do, diving quickly at the feet of Lafata. Candreva just put in a delicious ball from the right for Italy that Ciro Immobile wasn\u2019t far away from; meanwhile in Haifa, Izet Hajrovic has shot wide for the Bosnians. Maybe that\u2019ll calm things down around the Turkish side for a little while. Burak Yilmaz has just scored two in three minutes, the first coming from the spot. And the Italians have been forced into an early change in Milan \u2013 off comes Manuel Pasqual and into the fray is pitched Roberto Soriano, of Sampdoria, for his first cap. The Israelis continue to press the Bosnians and Tal Ben Haim \u2013 not that one \u2013 makes a nice run into the area from the left but, with the ball bobbling up, laces it far over the bar. A waste. Chance for the Czechs! David Lafata, who I was about to write about saying he wasn\u2019t a good enough attacking focal point, got in on the left and saw his shot sharply turned away by Halldorsson. Looking again at that Croatia goal, it was well struck by Perisic but Buffon really, really has to save that. Ouch. And with Cech erring too, not a good night for the big name \u2018keepers. An email from Patrick Hull: \u201cGood news about the Iceland goal. Their recent good form has been followed with big interest by my brother and me, as we\u2019ve had a soft spot for them ever since Championship Manager 03/04, where a raft of cheap Icelandic league players was enough to propel a team from the Conference to the Premier League in a few seasons. A question for any Icelandic readers; one of the best players was Johann \u00feorhallsson. Is the \u00fe just a P? Or how is it pronounced?\u201d I am not Icelandic, Patrick, but I believe it is like a \u201cth\u201d. A few good chances for Israel against the Bosnians, most recently for Damari, who went round Asmir Begovic and looked likely to score but was just forced too wide to covert. What a start here and it\u2019s Ivan Perisic for Croatia, picking the ball up on the left, receiving space to cut in on his right foot thanks to a clever run by Pranjic, and shooting low. It goes right through Gianluigi Buffon, who should do better, and it\u2019s in! It\u2019s Antonio Candreva for the Italians and it\u2019s a great finish! He picks the ball up 20 yards out and rifles a low, firm right-footer into Danijel Subasic\u2019s bottom right-hand corner. How wasteful from Krejci! He is played in delightfully by Plasil on the left and, all alone in the box, just needs to take a shot. He neither does that nor crosses, and the ball goes harmlessly wide. Andrey Galabinov for the Bulgarians, who are worth keeping an eye on themselves. Iceland lead after an error by Petr Cech! He came for a long throw, was absolutely nowhere near it, it was headed away from him and nodded back into the six-yard box by Bjarnason. The man on the end of it was Ragnar Sigurdsson, and what a big goal that is! Well that should have been one for the Czechs! David Lafata had a free header from Krejci\u2019s left-wing cross and it was straight down the throat of Halldorsson when it really should have been in. Bosnia, they of the no strikers, have started with some intent in Israel. Good possession but where will the goals come from? Fairly fast start in Plzen, where both teams look to use the flanks quickly. Tomas Rosicky, captaining the team today and certainly in need of a runout after barely featuring for Arsenal, has just had a shot blocked on the edge of the area. News from the Holland-Latvia game, by the way, that Daley Blind picked up a tear to his media ligament and is expected to be sidelined for 4-6 weeks. Volkan appears to have got over his fit of pique and starts, as planned, for Turkey. Our games are now underway. If you\u2019re quick, you can swot up on Iceland\u2019s dangerman tonight: That Italy v Croatia game, at San Siro, could be very close. The Italians have not convinced at home for a while to put it generously \u2013 they squeezed past Azerbaijan earlier in the qualifiers, 2-1, and have been held by both Luxembourg and Armenia in recent times. Croatia\u2019s sole away game has seen a 1-0 win in Bulgaria. Still, neither would be distraught with a point here. They both have nine so far. Israel v Bosnia is an important one too. Bosnia have started their qualifiers poorly with just two points from three; the Israelis have two wins out of two and start the game in second. The Bosnians are also without star attacking duo Edin Dzeko and Vedad Ibisevic for this one....looks like a very tough ask indeed for Safet Susic and company. More trouble for the Turks? Demirel is \u2013 or was \u2013 expected to start in goal for Turkey. Let\u2019s see.... There is an argument \u2013 and we can actually have an argument, if you like \u2013 that Czech Republic v Iceland is the match of the night. Both have three wins out of three; if either wins tonight, they might just have one foot in the Euros already. For Iceland, it would be a simply remarkable achievement. And not so shabby for the Czechs, either, whose lovely team of the early 2000s seems a distant dream. It would be good to see a revival from them. Anyway, this is the Iceland team for tonight (the match will be played in Plzen): The Czechs, for whom I shall give you a more orthodox Teams service, look like this: Cech, Kaderabek, Sivok, Kadlec, Pudil, Plasil, Darida, Dockal, Rosick\u00fd, Krejci, Lafata. In fact here are both lineups for that one \u2013 with formations! Here is Italy\u2019s team to face Croatia: You might think Turkey v Kazakhstan is a strange place to start our 7.45pm build-up. But that might be because you haven\u2019t read this absolutely astonishing story from Emre Sarigul on the incident that has ripped the Turkish side apart. It\u2019s a real cracker, so go on. Coming up next we have, in Group A, Czech Republic v Iceland and Turkey v Kazakhstan; in Group B, Israel v Bosnia-Herzegovina; in Group H, Bulgaria v Malta and Italy v Croatia. Team news and general tittle-tattle as we get it. More? You want more? You\u2019ll get more. Back in a moment with a look ahead to the 7.45pm fare... Meat and drink for the Cypriots and Georgios Efrem, who move onto six points and retain a big interest in what now looks a very, very tight group. What a result for the Welsh! They came under intense pressure in the second part of the first-half, and again late on in the game, but put in a wonderfully organised display and come away with a fantastic point! They need to be treated as the real deal now; that is a huge result for them. Oh my goodness! Five minutes and 50 seconds into added time, the ball bobbles everywhere from a corner and is then nodded towards goal by Benteke....and Hennessey dives to scramble away before his defender just about hack clear! What a save! That Nordtveit goal has pulled the Norwegians level on points with Italy and Croatia, who play shortly. Bale tries to be the hero but blasts over from range. He was the only man forwards. Robson-Kanu, who appeared to have cramp earlier, is replaced by Emyr Huws. My goodness that was easy. Wales are Taking Their Time here. Hennessey has been booked for timewasting, although I think that largely stemmed from prolonged crowd disapproval. Low Januzaj cross right in front of the posts and it could go anywhere....but Chester hacks away! Sneijder, Huntelaar, spin, low shot, slight deflection, fin. Six minutes of added time in Brussels. And what a big half-dozen for Wales. A penalty from Demetris Christofi there. Mertens is now stretchered off and, encouragingly, is moving his arms about. He will no doubt need to be assessed now; the game itself has just moved into the 90th minute.... Kolinko, over in Amsterdam, shows commendable 39-year-old reflexes to divert aside a chest-down-and-volley from Huntelaar. Mertens is surrounded by medical staff and being put on a stretcher. He will eventually be replaced by Adnan Januzaj but his health is the priority here, as that looked very nasty. But in Brussels, close from Hal Robson-Kanu! He, like Arjen Robben, cuts inside and shoots from the edge of the area! Unlike Robben, he sees his shot fumbled away by Courtois. Then there is an injury as Dries Mertens goes down in a heap after an awful clash of heads with George Williams, who accidentally missed the ball and headed into him. Not nice and you would assume he\u2019ll be taken off now. Arjen Robben cuts inside, shoots, scores. World keeps turning. A break from Wales, with a low ball from Ramsey evading Bale. But Belgium build again. Long 10 minutes ahead for Coleman\u2019s visitors, and that is demonstrated when Hennessey saves superbly from an unmarked Benteke...who is just offside. Ladies and gentlemen, Marouane Fellaini It\u2019s Jeffrey Bruma and it\u2019s four for the Dutch, his first international goal and in his home stadium to boot. He prodded home after a Sneijder corner had been flicked on. The corner came after Kolinko had saved what seemed a certain goal from Memphis Depay. Mertens crosses poorly and Hennessey has nothing between him and a simple catch. Belgium have created little in the second half so far, it must be said. Whistles from the crowd now as Wales play a little possession football at the back \u2013 which tell you that things are pretty much going exactly to plan... It is still Azerbaijan 0-1 Norway, by the way, if you\u2019re pining for news from Baku. A number of you have the same view as Howard Fishman about that Fellaini challenge; I wonder if we\u2019ll hear more about that later on.... Origi has come off now, Dries Mertens on. Belgium have such depth in attacking areas. Latvia\u2019s approach against the Dutch has not really changed regardless of the score. They\u2019re just trying to keep it down and are currently succeeding in doing so. A far cry from when they met as equals at Euro 2004. Eden Hazard tries to rabona a cross and puts it out of play. Erik Lamela is much better than him. \u201cWas I the only one who saw Fellaini knock Allen with a high &amp; deliberate elbow,\u201d asks Howard Fishman. There was certainly a suggestion of some \u2018afters\u2019 from a previous challenge... Not so close from De Bruyne, for whom space had been created. His 25-yarder is scuffed wide of the near post. And very close from Robben again, jinking onto his left and shooting just wide. It doesn\u2019t matter how often he does it and how many people think it must be easy to stop: they can\u2019t. Joe Allen has a bleeding nose, it seems, after a challenge with Marouane Fellaini, so there is a small pause in Brussels. At the moment Wales look reasonably comfortable. Neil Taylor just had an opening on his right-foot 20 yards out from a Bale pass. The left-back hasn\u2019t got that far forward all night and shot well over. Bang on the hour and a hat-trick for Georgios Efrem! Super stuff from the APOEL forward. Yes, Benteke has come on for Chadli with a good 28 minutes still to play. That move comes to a roar of approval from the crowd. Two out-and-out strikers on for Belgium now. We will soon be seeing Benteke, in good news for Kiran Kulkani. Bale tries another free-kick from distance but it\u2019s not as close as the one from earlier and is gathered by Courtois, Then Belgium counter and De Bruyne, allowed little space eventually, crosses for Ashley Williams to clear. Another promising moment from Williams, who is fleet of foot and picks the ball up from Hal Robson-Kanu. He tries to trick into his box and is denied semi-desperately by Alderweireld. In Amsterdam, Robben has just rattled the bar with a superb free-kick. Nice stuff, but little more to report from there, it\u2019s still 3-0. Kiran Kulkani is unhappy with Belgium: \u201cI am completely baffled the Belgians aren\u2019t the dominant side as they should really have been.. Their entire XI can replace the current Liverpool squad yet they aren\u2019t making things happen. \u201cWhy not start both Benteke &amp; Lukaku upfront just to unsettle the Welsh centre-backs psychologically? The sight of these two &amp; Hazard might fancy Coleman bringing himself &amp; \u2018Kit\u2019 ON to turn the 18-yard box into a parking lot...\u201d Close from Bale! That is the threat Wales carry! He runs the ball 40 yards down the left, shimmies into the box and drills a low one across Courtois and inches wide... Lombaerts gets up to a De Bruyne corner, and heads over. Belgium have won their fair share of headers from attacking set-pieces. I assume it\u2019s superb anyway. But not as superb as the footwork we saw from the 19-year-old Williams, out on the right, near the halfway line just now though, as he took Jan Vertonghen back to school before failing to find a decent final ball. Twitter correspondent @SergeNuffler has reminded (ok, informed) me that there is a superb recipe for Welsh rarebit (serve with cabbage and apple salad) by Nigel Slater on these pages today. A Wales change as we get back underway: David Cotterill off and George Williams, of Fulham, on. \u201cI\u2019d like to see more than a Welsh rarebit of attacking,\u201d says Mike MacKenzie, who I think can only be referring to Wales\u2019 infrequent forward incursions and tying it in with a popular national dish. Managerial nickname fun from J.R. in Illinois: \u201cIf you were going to pick a winner in the Belgium v Wales game based on manager nicknames it is no contest. \u2018War Pig\u2019 against \u2018Cookie\u2019 has to be the biggest mismatch in history.\u201d Yes. So who will actually win in, let\u2019s say, Azerbaijan (Mahmud Qurbanov) v Norway (Per-Mathias Hogmo)? Give us more nicknames. Cyprus 3-0 Andorra Azerbaijan 0-1 Norway Belgium 0-0 Wales Netherlands 3-0 Latvia Two done and dusted then, and two with all to play for. Wales came under heavier and heavier pressure as that half in Brussels went on, but I can\u2019t see they\u2019ll be too unhappy even if they got lucky-ish once or twice. Yes, Satya Gunput, Nordtveit and Efrem were indeed youngsters at Arsenal. Your prize is another four hours\u2019 Clockwatch viewing. Meanwhile, De Bruyne puts in a serviceable free-kick than Hennessey clutched well. Wales are close to reaching half-time unscathed and won\u2019t be unhappy to do so. Efrem scores again! It\u2019s very much a wrap there now, really, just 42 minutes in. It\u2019s Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, getting across his man from a low left-sided cross to score a very Huntelaar-ish goal, diverting the ball past the statuesque Kolinko. So, friends, what do Efrem and Nordtveit have in common? Fastest finger first. Havard Nordtveit gives Norway the lead in Baku! That one was a few minutes ago now, so apologies. Georgios Efrem makes it two! Belgium look like adding to our evening\u2019s tally at the moment. Wales, after a sprightly start in which Bale almost scored from a free-kick and Ramsey nearly found a way through to goal, have been up against it for the last 20 minutes or so. Arjen Robben with a screamer! In a rarely-seen move, he cuts in from the right and has a go with his left. It soars high inside the near post, to Kolinko\u2019s left. Love him or hate him, he is a wonderful player. From the corner, Fellaini gets up for the first header, which deflects off Ashley Williams and floats just beyond Chadli at the back post. It should be a corner and I can\u2019t believe the commentators don\u2019t see that themselves after two replays, but a corner it is not. ....which Eden Hazard hits off the wall. Wesley Sneijder has just fired high, high over the bar for the Dutch and has been shouted at by Robben. But swiftly to Brussels, where Joe Ledley has been booked and the Belgians have a 25-yard free kick of their own.... In every piece of top-quality comedy lies a kernel of truth, though, and Raymond\u2019s piece of genius there was born of reality. Latvia still don\u2019t look like leaving their own half much, one header wide a few minutes ago aside. It\u2019s one-way traffic. From Raymond Reardon: \u201cHolland\u2019s one man Van is too nimble for Latvia\u2019s five man Riga-mor-bus.\u201d Not going there. I. Am. Not. Going. There. You can, though. Send me some jokes. Belgium are putting their own \u2018keeper under pressure more than Wales are. An awful backpass bounces up to Courtois, under pressure from Cotterill, but he coolly unleashes his inner seal, heads it up and volleys it away. Belgium are stepping things up. Hazard and Origi, in particular have the ability to change the speed and direction of a seemingly-meandering spell of possession in an instant with a flick or a feint. They win another corner through the ever-industrious De Bruyne and then LOMBAERTS HITS THE POST after it\u2019s not cleared! He spins onto a loose ball and thuds one against the metalwork with Hennessey beaten! Nearly true. Hennessey saves Wales! Nacer Chadli is slipped in by a lovely Origi flick in the inside left channel as Belgium change the game\u2019s pace in an instant. The \u2018keeper is out of goal like a rocket and does just enough to deflect the ball away. Goalless between Azerbaijan and Norway still, by the way. And remember that Cyprus have hushed any Andorra noise. 1-0 there. Yes, Blind has gone off. Jordy Clasie (who is a, errr, classy midfielder from Feyenoord) comes on. Louis van Gaal will be worried. Concern for Manchester United! Daley Blind has just picked up an injury and been led from the field. The Dutch seem to be readying a sub but, at present, it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll be deployed or not... Thank [insert deity/other here] for that, an email. It\u2019s from John McEnerney: \u201cA night of hard graft for Wales, they\u2019ll need to hassle Belgium &amp; not let them settle hoping they can nick a goal on the break. The Welsh back 4 will be under pressure, long night ahead!\u201d Agree? They have started well. Meanwhile in Amsterdam, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has seen a shot gathered by Aleksandrs Kolinko \u2013 the former Crystal Palace goalkeeper who is now 39 (thirty-nine) years old. Hazard then beats FIVE Welsh players before shooting to Hennessey at his near post. This game has started very promisingly. ....and nearly scores! It\u2019s whipped up and over, it\u2019s parried by Courtois and the ball is just cleared away from Aaron Ramsey as he looks to convert the rebound. Now Wales have a free kick, a good 25 yards out. Bale, hairband and all, stands over it... Close for Belgium, a whipped Eden Hazard cross from the right being snicked just away from the looming Marouane Fellaini by James Chester. Then Wayne Hennessey is out quickly at the feet of Divock Origi, who had spun sharply in the box. It\u2019s Giorgos Merkis. Weekend of the Minnows indeed. Wales have shown a few good signs in the meantime against Belgium, Aaron Ramsey being denied by one last-ditch tackle and Gareth Bale hurrying Thibaut Courtois into a hurried clearance. The Dutch don\u2019t mess about this time though, a lovely bit of build-up play finding its way to Arjen Robben, streaking down the right, who elects to check back and cross rather than check back and shoot. His wall is spot-on and Robin van Persie powers home a free header. And the Dutch come so close against Latvia! Inside two minutes it was Ibrahim Afellay, teed up by Robin van Persie, bending one smack against the far post. They\u2019ve had almost total possession for far. Belgium the first to show in Brussels, with Anthony Vanden Borre skinning Neil Taylor and putting a deep cross in from the line. He\u2019s fresh from scoring twice in Anderlecht\u2019s improbable comeback against Arsenal, of course. Commentator\u2019s \u201cBelgium golden generation\u201d bingo: two seconds. I win. We\u2019ll be starting soon. A stat the Welsh won\u2019t like: Belgium have not lost a competitive match at home for four years. The Netherlands could do with a win tonight. They\u2019ve won one and lost two, currently sitting third in Group A and six points behind both Czech Republic and Iceland, and went a goal down to Kazakhstan at home last time out. They host Latvia. Norway, meanwhile, sit third in Group H \u2013 three points behind Italy and Croatia, who play each other later. A win over Azerbaijan and they\u2019ll have closed the gap on somebody, at least. They are one of the midfield sides to whom this new qualifying setup gives a lot of encouragement. A reminder that your 5pm fixtures are: Belgium v Wales; Cyprus v Andorra; Netherlands v Latvia; Azerbaijan v Norway Andorra there, looking to continue the success of the minnows this weekend after the heroics of the Faroe Islands (1-0 v Greece), San Marino (0-0 v Estonia) and Liechtenstein (1-0 v Moldova). The least I expect from them is clean sheet. Yes, Spurs. Yes, you do. Even if it\u2019s early days, that one\u2019s a really important game. Wales are top of the group although the Belgians have a game in hand \u2013 could they keep their run going by fending off a richly talented home side that never *quite* seems to hit the gears it should? Divock Origi, who\u2019s angling for an early move to Liverpool from Lille, leads the home side\u2019s attack with both Christian Benteke and Romelu Lukaku on the bench, which is worthy of an eyebrow-raising. Belgium v Wales \u2013 the teamsheet: Two tranches of Euro 2016 qualifying ACTION this post-meridian to chip away at your hangovers from Wayne Rooney\u2019s 100 cap party. Feast your eyes on what lies ahead and I\u2019ll be back shortly with lashings of trenchant, thought-provoking analysis: 5pm Group A: Netherlands v Latvia Group B: Belgium v Wales; Cyprus v Andorra Group C: Azerbaijan v Norway 7.45pm Group A: Czech Republic v Iceland; Turkey v Kazakhstan Group B: Israel v Bosnia-Herzegovina Group C: Bulgaria v Malta; Italy v Croatia Have some of that, as they say. Plots and sub-plots alike there, so don\u2019t be a stranger \u2013 hit the emails and tell me what you\u2019re hoping for over the next few hours. Football-wise, preferably, but I\u2019m not that strict. Nick will be along shortly. In the meantime have a read of Paul Doyle\u2019s preview to Belgium v Wales: Belief is building that Wales will soon end their long wait for a return to a major tournament. Secure a positive result in Brussels on Sunday and, though there will still be scope for twists and turns in the campaign, Welsh fans will be even more optimistic that their team can join the international elite for the first time since 1958. The assignment is daunting \u2013 Belgium are one of the most fancied teams in the competition and the favourites to win Group B \u2013 but it is Chris Coleman\u2019s team that stand atop that group and they could barely be in better shape. For once Coleman has a near full-strength squad to choose from, with Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen being particularly welcome back from injury along with Sam Ricketts, James Collins and Adam Matthews, three more players who forced to miss last month\u2019s victory over Cyprus and the draw with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mind you, James Chester and Chris Gunter performed so well in those games that Collins and Matthews may have to be content with a place on the bench at the King Baudouin Stadium.
