But our waiter is thwarting her. \u201cWe don\u2019t serve food in this part of the hotel, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, adding that breakfast has finished when she suggests we move. \u201cIs nothing available?\u201d she persists. He barely restrains a sigh. \u201cIs a croissant OK?\u201d \u201cPerfect!\u201d she says, triumphant. With another sigh, he disappears in search of what Taddeo describes as \u201cthe illicit croissant\u201d. She then leans over and whispers, \u201cWhen he comes back I\u2019m gonna freak him out and ask if I can now have scrambled eggs.\u201d In the past year, Taddeo has gone from being a relatively little known journalist to one of the most celebrated authors of 2019, thanks to her extraordinary debut book about women\u2019s appetites and desires, and how men frustrate and warp them. Three Women, which has been a bestseller in the US and the UK, tells the true stories of Maggie, Lina and Sloane, each of whom, for utterly personal and yet profoundly relatable reasons, has a complicated understanding of their own needs. Maggie alleges she had a sexual relationship with her high school teacher, Aaron Knodel, and we meet her as she\u2019s dealing with the emotional and legal aftermath. After being raped by three classmates as a teenager, Lina married a cold, undemonstrative man, and is now, as a mother of two, embarking on a frantic affair with an old boyfriend. Elegant, privileged Sloane has sex with other people so her husband can get a thrill from watching. Taddeo spent more than eight years on the book, crossing America six times in search of her subjects. Even having a baby didn\u2019t break her stride: she simply strapped her infant daughter into her sling and headed into bars in North Dakota, asking strangers if they would talk to her about their sex lives. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it made it more or less creepy that I had a baby with me. Probably more so,\u201d she says with a laugh. At least, she adds, the baby\u2019s presence generally reassured people she wasn\u2019t propositioning them. Once she found her subjects, she spent months with them, even moving to their towns to be part of their daily lives. Her husband, Jackson Waite, a screenwriter, moved with her, taking on jobs in the various towns to keep them afloat: \u201cHe has a degree in fine art and photography, and he used it to make Christmas pictures in K-Mart when we were in Indiana. He was quite good at it! He often believed in the book more than I did,\u201d she says. Taddeo\u2019s immersion in her subjects\u2019 lives is apparent in the amount of detail in the book, giving her lyrical reportage the depth of fiction. \u201cMaggie would say, \u2018So then we started kissing.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Wait, back up. Where were you sitting? What did you smell like? What were you wearing?\u2019 I knew how interior I wanted to get.\u201d Her efforts paid off: the book has been a huge success. Rachel Cooke in the Observer described it as \u201cthe best book on women and desire I have ever come across\u201d. Dave Eggers wrote that it was \u201cone of the most riveting, assured and scorchingly original debuts I\u2019ve ever read\u201d. (This was particularly gratifying: as a journalist, Taddeo had tried for years to write for Eggers\u2019 literary journal, McSweeney\u2019s Quarterly Concern.) The book feels ready made for a TV series, which is precisely what it is becoming: Taddeo, along with Waite, are adapting it for the US cable network Showtime. For Taddeo, who spent almost a decade isolating herself in research, the very public reaction has been astonishing. \u201cI thought I was writing a quiet little book, I really did. So the whole thing has been shocking. I\u2019m shocked.\u201d She puts the success down largely to luck, but the book sparks such passions, especially among women, that there is obviously more to it. When I posted a photo of the book on Instagram with a rapt caption about my love for it, around three-quarters of my female friends agreed with me, while the rest told me I\u2019d lost my mind. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see ourselves sometimes. That\u2019s where the vitriol comes from, I think. I\u2019ve always liked to see myself in books. When I read Mary Gaitskill\u2019s Bad Behaviour I was like, \u2018Oh yeah. These women are fucked up, too!\u2019 But some people are like, \u2018Those people are fucked up \u2013 I\u2019m not like them.\u2019 And maybe there are people who aren\u2019t fucked up over desire, but I haven\u2019t met them yet,\u201d Taddeo says. In each of the women\u2019s sections, which are told in alternating chapters, Taddeo drills down into the nuances. In the story of Maggie, which is probably the most instantly compelling, she blasts apart the cliches that shape the media coverage of so many sex abuse cases \u2013 Maggie, the child of alcoholics, was described as \u201ctroubled\u201d, Knodel, North Dakota\u2019s teacher of the year in 2014, was \u201ca family man\u201d. But Maggie\u2019s family, we learn, was very close and loving, and Knodel was phoning her for late-night chats, after his family was asleep. Even those who believed Maggie\u2019s story tell Taddeo, \u201cShe asked for it.\u201d \u201cBut to me, Maggie Wilken did not ask for it. She accepted it, the way any child accepts any decoration, any gift,\u201d Taddeo writes. Meanwhile, the first time Sloane watched her husband having sex with another woman, she felt \u201cher actual soul melt out and skitter from the room\u201d. But then she began to enjoy their open relationship and the complicated feeling of control over her husband it gave her: \u201cShe knew he liked to abdicate his power. She was happy to please him.\u201d Some reviewers suggested the book was helped by the cresting interest in the #MeToo movement, but Three Women feels like a counterweight to all the discussions of sexual harassment and assault. While #MeToo focused on men\u2019s unrestrained sexual desire and self-entitlement, Three Women is about how women control their own impulses to the point they become utterly divorced from them. \u201cMen can frighten us, other women can frighten us, and sometimes we worry so much about what frightens us that we wait to have an orgasm until we are alone. We pretend to want things we don\u2019t want so nobody can see us not getting what we need,\u201d Taddeo writes in a pair of typical punch-to-the-gut sentences. \u201cThe thing with #MeToo is that when we talk so much about what we don\u2019t want we\u2019re not talking about what we do want,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people tend towards the extremes [when talking about #MeToo]. If you\u2019re in the middle saying, \u2018Well, you know, there\u2019s nuance\u2019, everyone\u2019s like, \u2018No there\u2019s not!\u2019 But there is. And in Maggie\u2019s story especially I wanted to look at that. To not explore nuance in that situation would not be true to her story.\u201d Rather than black and white, Taddeo\u2019s book focuses forensically on the emotional greys. And, for that reason, it probably reflects a more universal female experience. In person, Taddeo is larkier and more self-deprecating than she comes across in her writing, often making fun of her own phrasings (\u201cGod, I sound so \u2013 ugh!\u201d). When I ask how the success of the book has changed her life, she says, \u201cOther than that I get to fly around the world, not at all. My anxiety is still at fever pitch. I\u2019m always wildly fearful about life and death.\u201d Taddeo was born and raised in New Jersey. Her father died unexpectedly when she was 23, and within the next seven years she also lost her mother, her aunt, her uncle and her dog. \u201cSo I\u2019m always waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d she says. As a result, she always travels with her daughter, who is now four. \u201cI haven\u2019t been away from her for a single night since she\u2019s been born, and that\u2019s not about pure motherly love \u2013 it\u2019s about how, if I\u2019m not there, I can\u2019t control the situation,\u201d she says. While Taddeo\u2019s life hasn\u2019t changed, her subjects\u2019 have. She is still in frequent contact with them and, before publication, was concerned about how Maggie, the most vulnerable of the trio, would be affected. Knodel was acquitted of three of the charges against him \u2013 the other two were dropped after the judge ruled there had been a mistrial. As a result Maggie, unlike Lina and Sloane, wanted her real name to be used in the book; she felt that her story had been dismissed, but now was the moment she could make herself heard. And that is exactly what has happened: since publication, Maggie and Taddeo have received thousands of messages from other young women who have gone through similar experiences. After years of being called a slut and a homewrecker, Maggie told Taddeo, the book has given her closure. Neither Knodel nor his lawyers have contacted Taddeo. I tell her this surprises me, as I can\u2019t understand how she was able to write about a sexual relationship between Maggie and her teacher, given that he was acquitted. Taddeo smiles and says, with the suggestion of heavy understatement, \u201cThere was a lot of legal vetting. Lots of insertion of words like \u2018allegedly.\u2019 But it\u2019s funny, only British readers ask me about that. Maybe in the US we\u2019re more, \u2018Whatever!\u2019\u201d Lina has largely ignored the book, preferring instead to concentrate on her new relationship and not look back, Taddeo says. I ask about Sloane. Surely, I say, people in her small town have recognised her. \u201cMmm it\u2019s been a little tricky. Let\u2019s just say no comment,\u201d she says. Taddeo generally prefers to read fiction; authors such as Lucia Berlin, Tessa Hadley, William Trevor and Elena Ferrante give her \u201cthe deep interiority\u201d she looks for in storytelling. So it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that she has written a non-fiction book that feels like a novel. But she has always been adept at mixing the genres: in 2008 she caused a minor media sensation with her Esquire article imagining the final days of Heath Ledger (Esquire called it \u201creported fiction\u201d). As she was working on Three Women, she continued to jump back and forth over the border between fiction and reportage: in the lulls when she was waiting to find another subject, or to hear back from Sloane, she knocked out a novel and a collection of short stories. Both were bought by her publisher. The success of Three Women is a testament to Taddeo\u2019s commitment but also a sign of how many women recognise that their desires aren\u2019t met, and how relieved they are that someone is vocalising that. In that sense, the book is both a triumph of writing and a tragedy for women. \u201cTotally. I wasn\u2019t surprised by much during my research, but I was surprised at how strongly people related to it,\u201d says Taddeo. The interview and croissant are finished, and she manages to get a coffee out of the reluctant waiter. She puts two, then three, then four sugar cubes in it, then looks up guiltily: \u201cThis is terrible, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. I tell her she does not need to apologise for wanting some sugar. \u201cI apologise for everything,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a woman, I\u2019ve apologised my whole life.\u201d \u2022 Three Women is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a316.99).
