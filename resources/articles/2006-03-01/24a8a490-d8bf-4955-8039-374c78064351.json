Sir Michael Darrington, managing director, said Greggs was changing its product range to reflect changing tastes and would devote more marketing to its low-fat items, such as the chicken rolls. \"There will always be a market for enjoyable sausage rolls, but there will also be a market for an alternative,\" he said. Greggs, which runs 1,300 bakeries selling sandwiches and pastries, reported a 5% increase in pre-tax profit to a record \u00a350m last year, as like-for-like sales rose 4%. But the chairman, Derek Netherton, said profits in the first nine weeks of this year were \"materially below\" 2005 levels, while sales were flat. \"While it is much too early to predict the performance of the business for the year as a whole, we believe that it is unlikely that we will attain the level of profit achieved in 2005,\" Mr Netherton said. This would be only the second time in Greggs' 22 years that it has not increased profits from one year to the next. Greggs shares fell nearly 12% yesterday. Sir Michael said the \"kick in the teeth\" had been the higher energy prices with which Greggs had to contend. \"That is causing us big issues,\" he said. The company expected a \u00a35m increase in energy costs this year. He added that it was difficult to know how long poor trading conditions, which have lasted since May last year, would continue, but suggested they could persist for up to two years. \"We're not going to overreact, but by no means are we complacent.\" Greggs was \"bearing down on costs\" to offset the weak sales. The company said Malcolm Simpson, who has been finance director since 1975, would retire in May. He will be succeeded by his deputy, Richard Hutton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
