As the coach enters the Plaza de Lima it comes under attack from armed terrorists. They open fire on the coach and hurl grenades at it, which fortunately miss. Nevertheless, eight people are killed including six policemen. The match is cancelled and the England team are flown home immediately. At Heathrow, a \"clearly shaken\" John Terry explains the nature and extent of the injuries suffered by him and his team-mates: \"Stevie G has a shrapnel wound in his leg, but he is fine. Crouchy had shrapnel in his chest, but thank God it wasn't very deep and just on the surface. I had shrapnel injuries in my shoulder, but they have all been removed and I'm OK now. Young Theo had shrapnel in his neck and scalp, but he too has had medical attention and is fine. Everyone else is perfectly all right.\" It is the first time since Munich 1972 that sports stars have been targeted by terrorists on the European mainland. All sporting tours to Spain are cancelled. John Terry receives a knighthood for bravery in the Queen's Birthday List. There is, somewhat fancifully, talk of a Victoria cross. Four months later in South Africa, England reach the World Cup finals where they face Spain. As a gesture of solidarity the teams stand together for the national anthems. There are many minutes of silence. For over a month the 24-hour rolling news channels have led their bulletins with the England squad's every move. An award-winning highlight being live coverage of the \"Boys of '10 Get Back on the Bus\". \"Getting back together, going on a bus, sometimes you look around and you feel how vulnerable you are if anyone wants to do any harm,\" says Captain JT. \"At the same time it is great to get back on it as a team and play your first major tournament after Madrid. That feeling of togetherness, being through tough situations, and playing the game we love brings us a lot closer together. Everyone just fell into their places. Lots of players have seats they are really fond of: Wayne always sits on the right three to four rows from the front and the Neviller likes to sit at the back. So the guys are back in their usual positions. Life is back to normal.\" Gary Neville expresses most eloquently how the players have changed: \"You realise there are more things to life than football. I just want to concentrate and enjoy the simple things and make the most of every moment. I know that in this world nothing is sure right now; anything can happen if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" An extraordinary story and, of course, one that will be played out at Lord's this afternoon when Sri Lanka play Pakistan with Samaraweera as Gerrard, Tharanga as Crouch, Mendis as Walcott, Sangakkara as Terry, Jayasuriya as Rooney and Jayawardene as Neville. Before the tournament Sangakkara promised: \"We are trying to play on our unpredictability and our unorthodox make-up and hopefully we will be able to come up with the unexpected.\" They have more than delivered on this promise. The batting has been innovative, with \"The Dilshan\" a Kamikaze addition to a batsman's range of strokes. And the bowling of the three Ms (Muralitharan, Mendis and Malinga) has been so exceptional that they are on the way to being ranked alongside the three Ws (Worrell, Walcott and Weekes), who so dominated the West Indies middle order in the Fifties and Sixties. For all these reasons, most neutrals, and perhaps even some Pakistanis, will be hoping they triumph this afternoon. And even if they don't, they are already The Team of the Year. will@willbuckley.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
