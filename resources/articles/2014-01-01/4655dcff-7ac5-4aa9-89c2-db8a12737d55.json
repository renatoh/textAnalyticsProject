Not only is he moving more freely than he has done for at least two years \u2013 he thrashed 17 aces past Lleyton Hewitt on Friday, including one of 133mph, and arched his back pleasingly to put away two smashes \u2013 but he seems to have found a certain calmness. \"I feel now I should be able to cope with anything, nerves or pressure, anything that I'll have to deal with on the tennis court,\" he said, looking back on his four months away from the Tour and the extended recovery programme he has undertaken in Miami since surgery on his lower back in late September. Although only an exhibition match, his two-setter against Hewitt at Kooyong revealed he was at least in sound physical shape before his opening match in the Australian Open on Tuesday, against the 29-year-old Japanese hardcourt specialist, Go Soeda, who is ranked 112 in the world. \"The one thing I haven't done since I've been a professional, the last few years, is to recover from surgery, and that's something that's completely different. There are different stresses and nerves. But once I get back to play matches I wouldn't have thought I'd have too many problems dealing with nerves and pressure, for the rest of my career.\" Those are the positive results of his enforced sabbatical, the longest of his career since he took time out after injuring his wrist on his 20th birthday in 2007. The unknown factor is how he will cope in the heat of competition \u2013 and heat will be the common enemy in Melbourne all week. Given he is in the same half of the draw as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, Murray will almost certainly be condemned to play during the day, to leave the night-time spots clear for the media pulling power of his more garlanded peers. \"From the quarters onwards,\" Murray said, \"they pretty much play everything in the night, but the first week I normally play a couple early doors \u2013 and the first week's normally hotter than the second week. It comes down to whether you've put the work in or not, and I hope that I have. Even in Miami [from where he has flown after an extended training block] it's hot and it's humid. But it's different here. Training in 32 [centigrade] and then going out [to play] in 40, it's a huge difference. You really feel it. The court surface gets roasting, your feet get really hot, your legs start to get tired early and burn, and then with the sun in your face, it's so strong here that your skin's burning. It's not easy.\" Having made playing tennis on a hot day sound like the Labours of Hercules, Murray has at least prepared himself for the worst. Like most professional athletes, he is by nature suspicious of all impediments, and not many escape his gaze, from a feather on the court during last year's final to a well-oiled fan giving him the benefit of his tennis wisdom at Kooyong on Friday. Murray stopped and stared at the comedian, and got a sheepish \"sorry\" for his efforts, before losing a tight workout to the Australian. Federer, who beat Murray here in the first of his three defeats in finals, said: \"He knows how to play on the hard courts, and he has been one of the best in the last few years. So, without the surgery, clearly it would put him as a favourite. Now that he had that, I don't know where his game's at. \"I hope for him he is where he wants to be and that he can put himself into position. I'm sure he needs a few rounds to get also settled into the tournament. But normally he would be absolutely one of the favourites.\" Every now and again, Murray gives us a gem. He delivered on cue when asked if celebrity coaches \u2013 such as his own, Ivan Lendl, alongside Tour debutants Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg and Michael Chang \u2013 make players try harder to impress them because of their standing in the game. \"That's definitely there at the beginning of the relationship,\" he said. \"It's kind of like any relationship you have. If it's with a woman, I would try to impress my girlfriend a lot more the first few months I was with her than I do now, I guess.\" He paused and smiled to take in what he had said ... and ploughed on. \"I guess that's natural. But, yeah, it's the same with Ivan. The first few months when I was working with him, you're kind of nervous going into practice sessions. That's a good thing. It shows that you care and want to impress him. But then over time, you get used to having him around. It's not quite the same. But that happens in a lot of different relationships.\" Asked if this meant his girlfriend, Kim Sears, would not be getting any more flowers, he blushed and said: \"She didn't get many flowers at the start either. But, yeah, not so much.\" He might have a tougher time arguing his way out of that one than he does getting past Mr Soeda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
