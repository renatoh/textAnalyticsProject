Technology entrepreneur Larry Marshall said his experience running start-up ventures through three US recessions meant he was \u201cno stranger to adversity, difficult times and crises\u201d. \u201cThe one thing that always comes from a crisis is that it turns into the catalyst for change and redirection, which generally leads to something great,\u201d Marshall told ABC Radio National on Friday morning. \u201cI\u2019m actually somewhat hopeful that we will be able to convince the government thats it\u2019s very much in the interest of the country to continue to fund CSIRO, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take very much convincing. \u201cI think there is no one else capable in Australia, on a massive scale, [of conducting] research across so many areas that affect so many aspects of Australians\u2019 lives.\u201d To do that, he would have to focus on the innovation arm of the organisation, Marshall told the ABC. He said his background as a scientist, entrepreneur and venture capitalist uniquely positioned him to do that and meant he also appreciated the importance of basic, fundamental science. He would not step away from that core work in the process of trying to commercialise and monetise technology, he said. \u201cI did things backwards, I fell in love with the technology first, which you should never do, and then I went out and tried to figure out what the most important problem was that we could solve with that technology,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a pure business person you would never do that, you always start with problem then try and find the technology to solve it. \u201cIn a way my history makes me uniquely qualified to help CSIRO take the wonderful innovations and science and make it meaningful and bring it to real-world products that affect the lives of every Australian and become an important part of Australian industry.\u201d But he also acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s not innovation until someone writes a cheque.\u201d Marshall will replace geologist Dr Megan Clark, the CSIRO\u2019s first female chief executive, when her term expires at the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
