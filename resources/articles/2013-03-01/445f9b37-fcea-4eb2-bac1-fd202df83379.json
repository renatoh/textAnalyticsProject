Asked on Saturday about the docking of five points for fielding an ineligible player, the coach, Lyn Jones, was virtually silenced by a club official and, given the way the club's luck is running at the moment, it was probably a clever decision. Jones was left to deal with the most recent kick in the teeth and the widening gap between London Welsh and safety in the Premiership following Sale's last-gasp win over Bath and the one-point defeat which the Exiles suffered at Gloucester after being the more assured side for much of the afternoon. They also scored the only try of the game and, according to Jones, were denied a \"glaring\" penalty try. Welsh were still leading with five minutes to go before Gloucester reclaimed the lead they had lost an hour earlier when Freddie Burns ended an unimpressive afternoon by landing his fifth penalty. The kick \u2013 coming alongside four misses \u2013 keeps Gloucester in the hunt for a play-off place and went a long way to confirming Heineken Cup rugby at Kingsholm next season. For Jones, it was the end of another bad day at the office. He is already suffering as players sign for other clubs \u2013 the full-back Tom Arscott is heading for Sale and Leicester have tempted the hooker Neil Biggs \u2013 and Gavin Henson limped out of a fitness test before Saturday's game, leaving Welsh unsure what part their fly-half will play in the remaining four games of the season. \"When I joined London Welsh I said there wasn't an experience in rugby that I hadn't come across, but I was wrong,\" said Jones. \"What is going on is another test that is energy-sapping. We just have to try to keep our focus on what we can influence \u2026 we need to keep believing. \"When you are a professional sportsman, 80% of the time is dealing with rejection and disappointment, and you have to have a mental toughness to deal with that. There is nothing we can do in terms of the appeal, but when we are on the field we can do something about it, which is what I keep telling the players. \"We need to turn up next Saturday at Bath and do the best we can, and then likewise against Northampton, London Irish and Worcester. Can we win the four games? Potentially, we can.\" But Jones will need more luck than he had on Saturday, when Gloucester were distinctly second best for 75% of the game but stayed in touch because London Welsh failed to land the killer blow. Jones saw an overlap and a probable try when Jonny May deliberately knocked down Jonathan Mills's try-line pass. But the real damage was self-inflicted, Henson's understudy, Gordon Ross, missing the conversion of Phil McKenzie's try and then a penalty. That would have made the lead13 points with 22 minutes to go, the Burns radar on the blink and Gloucester looking like a side that could play all night without scoring a try. \"We were committed and there was lots of good in our game,\" said Jones. \"But when you come to places like Kingsholm you have to take your opportunities. \"It is difficult to take it on the chin. But what is important is not how you finish this week, it's how you turn up next week,\" he added.
