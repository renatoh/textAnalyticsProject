But I thought it sounded fun. Interesting. Different.\u201d The offer arrived at one of the lowest points in her life: she was crying in her consulting room when she took the call that would turn out to be the solution, or in her words, \u201ca blessing\u201d. It was March 2004, Brown was 49 and had angrily and impulsively resigned over government plans for new GP contracts, which would reward surgeries for meeting certain targets, such as checking cholesterol or completing mental health questionnaires during consultations. Although Brown had started the practice from scratch 20 years previously \u2013 and her husband, a property developer, had actually built the surgery \u2013 her partners had informed her they would \u201cresent\u201d her if their income fell because she refused to tick boxes and meet targets. \u201cI couldn\u2019t work that way and had no choice but to leave,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI was nearly 50, that was my pension, I had two kids and a mortgage, but it was my \u2018sliding doors\u2019 moment.\u201d She resigned and wrote a blistering article for the GP magazine Pulse. A recruiter for the prison service spotted it and called her. Her second career, a midlife leap into the unknown, is set out in Brown\u2019s book. The Prison Doctor is a fascinating, sometimes funny, often gruelling account of working behind bars. It also charts her own journey as she morphs from GP in a quiet, comfortable patch of England to passionate advocate on behalf of prisoners. Her first post was a relatively gentle start in HMP Huntercombe, then a male prison for juveniles aged 15-18. \u201cMy sons were that age so I\u2019d gone in thinking I understood how boys are,\u201d she says. She is refreshingly honest about her utter cluelessness. On her first day, she complimented one of the boys on his cheery orange jumpsuit. He explained that he had to wear orange because he\u2019d tried to escape. \u201cWhat shocked me when I got there was how many were already fathers and how many had grown up in care,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many of them had no one who cared about them.\u201d At Huntercombe, there was nothing \u201cmedically challenging\u201d; Brown\u2019s abiding memory is the stream of appointments about \u201caching feet\u201d as the boys sought special permission to replace prison footwear with their own trainers. Self-harm was rife \u2013 as it has been in all the prisons Brown served in. A psychiatrist would address the behaviour while Brown treated the injuries. The hardest adjustment was the complete change required in her working methods. As a GP who\u2019d lived near her surgery and frequently made home visits, Brown\u2019s life had always been entwined with those of her patients. She welcomed babies and watched them grow. She diagnosed illnesses and saw patients recover. At Huntercombe, she was forbidden from divulging any personal information and heard nothing about how the boys had come to be in prison. She often saw them only once and had no way of learning if she\u2019d helped, what happened next or how their lives would unfold. Brown recalls one prisoner who presented with a bad back and difficulty sleeping. He had the standard buzz-cut, tattooed knuckles, lacerations on his wrists (he\u2019d used a plastic yogurt pot) and old cigarette burns on his back. As they talked, it became apparent he\u2019d grown up in care and had no family. Brown mentioned she liked to write when she couldn\u2019t sleep and a few weeks later the boy returned with a poem he\u2019d written. She was so moved by its contents she cried. As he began to write more, Brown bought him a dictionary and thesaurus only to learn that giving it to him was against the rules. It would be seen as \u201cconditioning\u201d. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the book,\u201d she says. \u201cHe could have got that out the library. I just wanted him to know I believed in him.\u201d Huntercombe was like a \u201choliday camp\u201d compared to Brown\u2019s next placement, as duty doctor at Wormwood Scrubs, the notorious prison which holds more than 1,200 male inmates. Here, consultations took place with Brown seated closest to the open door and an alarm close to hand. Shortly before she arrived, a nurse had been taken hostage by a prisoner. On the segregation wing, she saw patients through a hatch \u2013 sometimes to be met instead by a stream of abuse, saliva, or worse. \u201cOne of the challenging things was never knowing what might be waiting on the other side of the door.\u201d Brown functioned in a state of high alert, a constant charge of adrenalin. She might be called to an attempted suicide, a violent psychosis brought on by spice (smuggled drugs were by far the most frightening problem for her) or a horrific prisoner attack \u2013 she recalls being called to the showers where a naked man had been scalded with boiling sugar water. For the most part, Brown had no idea why the men were in prison, and she preferred it that way. She only saw the patient, never the prisoner. \u201cFor that reason, it\u2019s easier not to know,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I was treating a paedophile who\u2019d been attacked, I only allowed myself to see the old man as he was then.\u201d Over the seven years Brown spent at Scrubs, she felt increasingly at ease and involved with the prisoners\u2019 lives. When a young man who spoke no English arrived in a wheelchair because he\u2019d jumped from a window fleeing police and his shattered legs had both been amputated, she cried. \u201cI cry a lot and it\u2019s embarrassing, but the day I lose my compassion is the day I stop working\u201d. When a violent prisoner from the segregation ward presented her with an intricate miniature racing car he\u2019d carved from a bar of soap \u2013 in thanks for \u201cbeing kind and not judging\u201d \u2013 she floated home on a high. Her final move was to HMP Bronzefield, the largest female prison in Europe. Brown calls it her \u201chappy place\u201d and, at 65, has no wish to leave. The women have been more open, seem to care more what she thinks and she describes her more regular patients as \u201calmost friends\u201d. \u201cBut the biggest difference from the men,\u201d she says, \u201cis how many women prisoners are victims themselves,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThey are victims of abuse, violence, rape. Their stories are heart breaking, overwhelming. I get lost for words when I think about them. At Bronzefield, you do learn what they\u2019re in for and it\u2019s usually shoplifting, theft, breach of licence. You do question whether prison is the right place for them \u2013 except for the fact that so many tell me it\u2019s a refuge. One of them, who has a violent partner, told me it\u2019s the first time she had felt safe in bed for seven years.\u201d Brown admits that the closer she has become to her patients, the less kindly disposed she has felt towards former friends. She swears more. She has less patience at social events and finds it harder than ever to tolerate social bragging. \u201cI don\u2019t really go to parties any more \u2013 no one invites me!\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband would say I\u2019ve become more assertive. I see people who have absolutely nothing. My eyes have been opened and it puts a different perspective on conversations that start with, \u2018So what are your boys doing now?\u2019 I hope this book can be a voice for the prisoners.\u201d There are many unforgettable stories and lives in Brown\u2019s book. One is Andrea. She became a heroin addict after being attacked with a hammer, taken prisoner for two days and raped multiple times. She was 27 and had been on the way home from giving a talk on computer programming. Another is Trudy, sexually abused by her stepfather since the age of four. Brown doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s become of them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a folder stuffed with letters that prisoners wrote to me while they were there but, of course, I\u2019ll never see them again. If they\u2019re not back inside a few months later, I have to thank God and hope for the best.\u201d She pauses, then adds: \u201cThat\u2019s the worst part of prison medicine for me. You never know what happened next.\u201d The Prison Doctor by Amanda Brown is published by Harper Collins at \u00a38.99 on 13 June.
