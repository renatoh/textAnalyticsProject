The Conservatives also attacked the bill, warning that it threatens \"another stealth tax on motorists\" by allowing pay-as-you-drive schemes whose proceeds could flow back to the Treasury. The bill paves the way for road-pricing schemes across England and Wales. However, its main thrust focuses on giving local authorities the right to determine bus timetables, fares and routes under the so-called \"quality contract\" system. FirstGroup and Stagecoach oppose quality contracts - which could see incumbent operators turfed out - and have lobbied successfully for independent scrutiny of any local authority proposal. The association of local transport bodies, PTEG, warned yesterday that this provision could delay changes to bus services by four years. Jonathan Bray, PTEG assistant director, said the bill put fewer barriers in the way of the more controversial proposals for local road-pricing schemes. \"Road pricing, which people in local areas would find much more controversial, is not subject to anywhere near as much scrutiny. But bus reform, which everyone wants, is subject to veto by an unelected body.\" Ten areas in England are considering road-pricing schemes, including Manchester and Birmingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
