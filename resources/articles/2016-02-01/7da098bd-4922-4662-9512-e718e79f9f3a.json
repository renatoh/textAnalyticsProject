Storm Imogen may have packed a gale-force punch this week but Storm Eddie Jones is a typhoon showing little sign of blowing itself out. The head coach is challenging everyone to up their game on a daily basis and those unable to do so will not last long. For long-serving squad members such as Mike Brown it has certainly swept away the cobwebs of last year\u2019s ill-fated World Cup experience. Hearing Jones talk of his desire to speed up England\u2019s game and his belief they can \u201csmack\u201d sides like Italy makes the 30-year-old full-back even happier. \u201cIt does give us a lift,\u201d said Brown, sounding as positive as he has in some time. \u201cIt makes you want to show him that we can do it.\u201d The way Brown sees it, Jones is not being remotely disrespectful when he talks about giving Italy \u201ca hiding\u201d but is simply reflecting what he sees on the training field in Bagshot. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re working with England \u2013 or you\u2019re English \u2013 you\u2019re straight away called arrogant. But it\u2019s just his expectations of us from seeing how we train and how we play for our clubs. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem with that. We should all expect high standards of ourselves.\u201d So when Jones, as he did , announces that his team need to get fitter to overtake the best southern hemisphere sides, his players are not entirely surprised. \u201cWe know he wants to play quick,\u201d continued Brown. \u201cThat comes from quick breakdowns. Get that breakdown sorted out and, with the players we\u2019ve got, we\u2019ll be a tough team to beat. We\u2019re all excited by that challenge and in the last two weeks in training we\u2019ve come on in leaps and bounds.\u201d Half the battle is reacting quicker around the contact area, not latterly England\u2019s forte. Jones likes the long-term look of Harlequins\u2019s Jack Clifford as a No8 but accepts England currently do not have an out-and-out seven. That said, he was delighted with James Haskell\u2019s weekend contribution even if the compliment came with a mischievous caveat attached. \u201cThere is a rumour going round that James Haskell has got bad hands. That\u2019s not true. He\u2019s got terrible hands,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut on Saturday he used them really well. He was dynamite in defence \u2026 it was a great openside display, not in the traditional sense but in the way we are defending. He made 22 tackles. If Richie McCaw makes 22 tackles, everyone raves about him.\u201d England\u2019s erstwhile captain Chris Robshaw, in turn, took delivery of a double-edged cricketing analogy \u2013 \u201cTidy, mate, 10 overs for not much\u201d \u2013 and closer review of the Murrayfield tape also reinforced Jones\u2019s view that his team are not yet entirely comfortable playing at real pace. \u201cOur first 20 minutes was almost immaculate. Then we fell away in the next 20. We got fatigued and our skill level dropped off. That is the difference between Test and club rugby. The speed of the game in the second 20 does not drop off in Tests.\u201d The other reason for making a change or two against Italy is to build depth in case of future injury or suspension \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not related to how they played at the weekend \u2026 we need to go to the World Cup with three very good options in each position\u201d \u2013 as well as help to encourage the kind of upbeat mindset currently serving Leicester City so well. \u201cIf you look at the soccer analogy at the moment, how are Leicester City on top of the Premier League?\u201d asked Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of attitude and how hard they work for each other. It\u2019s because the sum of that team is greater than the individuals.\u201d Whatever happens against the Azzurri, Brown is hoping for better luck than in last year\u2019s fixture at Twickenham when he was knocked out and suffered subsequent concussion symptoms. He says he cannot recall much about it \u2013 \u201cI only lasted eight minutes \u2026 it feels like ages ago\u201d \u2013 but reckons concussion awareness is now improving fast. The next challenge is to try and help England\u2019s attacking game do the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
