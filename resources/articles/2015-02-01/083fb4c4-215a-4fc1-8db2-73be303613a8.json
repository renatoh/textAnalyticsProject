For anybody to be calm and play football the way they did, I take my hat off.\u201d Blackpool manager Lee Clark said: \u201cIt\u2019s tough. But while it\u2019s mathematically possible we\u2019ve got to keep going.\u201d Cardiff City 0-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers Kenny Jackett said he is daring to dream of automatic promotion after Bakary Sako\u2019s goal gave the visitors three crucial points at Cardiff, spoiling Vincent Tan\u2019s first visit of the season. The Malaysian owner had not watched his team live since May, but saw them beaten, with their cause not helped by a second-half red card for Peter Whittingham. \u201cWe have goals and spirit,\u201d said Jackett. \u201cIt\u2019s still there for us. You have to believe we can do it.\u201d Russell Slade said: \u201cThe owner spoke to the players before the game and I\u2019ve spoken to him since. He thought we were unlucky.\u201d Rotherham United 2-1 Millwall Ian Holloway admitted feeling the pressure after Millwall\u2019s fans turned on him \u2013 and were involved in clashes with police. Trouble began after Kari Arnason\u2019s 85th-minute winner, with reports of more violence outside the ground after full-time. \u201cI didn\u2019t see [the fighting],\u201d said Holloway. \u201cI was concentrating on my job and I felt I acted with dignity from start to finish. I\u2019m not getting results so the fans turn on me \u2013 but I\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing that rather than getting at the team. I believe I can turn this around, but if other people don\u2019t then it\u2019s not in my control.\u201d And the rest Ten-man Birmingham secured three points and set back Brentford\u2019s play-off hopes with James Tarkowski\u2019s own goal giving them a 1-0 win at St Andrew\u2019s. \u25a0 Bolton\u2019s Zach Clough scored his sixth goal in nine games, earning a 1-0 win that leaves Brighton six points off the relegation zone. \u25a0 Bournemouth are without a win in five after being held to a scrappy 0-0 home draw by Blackburn \u2013 a match delayed by half an hour after a road accident left Artur Boruc and Tommy Elphick stuck in traffic. \u25a0 Tony Watt scored twice as Charlton beat former manager Chris Powell\u2019s Huddersfield side 3-0 at The Valley. \u25a0 Reading went down 3-0 at home to Dougie Freedman\u2019s resurgent Nottingham Forest side with Ben Osborn, Matty Fryatt and Gary Gardner scoring the goals. \u25a0 And Sheffield Wednesday achieved their first home win since Boxing Day, 2-0 against second-placed Middlesbrough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
