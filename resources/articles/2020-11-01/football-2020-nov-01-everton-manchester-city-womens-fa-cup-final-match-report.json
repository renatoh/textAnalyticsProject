The coronation of Manchester City as winners of the 50th Women\u2019s FA Cup had long felt pre-ordained, perhaps even inevitable. But not until Georgia Stanway managed to squeeze the ball under the body of Sandy MacIver, with City\u2019s 26th shot of the match, did it feel certain. It was tough on Everton, but ultimately not unfair. They had scrapped and fought and poured every last ounce of themselves into this contest. They had dragged themselves impressively back into the game courtesy of Val\u00e9rie Gauvin\u2019s header on the hour. Their goalkeeper Sandy MacIver certainly deserved better after producing not so much a string of saves as an entire repertoire of Biblical miracles. But as the minutes ticked away, first the 90 and then the 120, City\u2019s superior class and depth almost invariably found a way through. The fact that their two extra-time goals came from substitutes \u2013 Stanway and Janine Beckie with the last kick of the game \u2013 illustrated the gulf in resources that still separates these two clubs. City had match-winners all over the pitch, from the dominant Sam Mewis to the superb Caroline Weir, and could even afford an off-day from the celebrated Rose Lavelle. Still, you wondered if Everton could have been just a little braver at times, just a little more willing to dictate terms against a defence that had not kept a clean sheet since the middle of September. Precious little of the swagger that Everton have shown since the resumption of the Women\u2019s Super League was on evidence here, even if much of the defensive solidity was. In hindsight, the first-half injury to Gauvin was a pivotal moment. Though she limped on, her lack of mobility badly hindered Everton\u2019s pressing game, a strategy based on fierce running and dynamic counter-attack. Indeed, from the very start Everton looked feverish and skittish, risk-averse and reactive, too slow to show for the ball and too quick to get rid of it. Despite offering very little attacking threat of their own, City were allowed to settle into the game with long periods of possession. MacIver dived bravely at the feet of Mewis, who was beginning to grow ominously into the game. Chloe Kelly, the winger who had done so much to help Everton reach Wembley before her move to City in the summer, had a sharp shot saved at the near post. The Spain international Damaris Egurrola had Everton\u2019s best chance, squeezing a shot just over the bar. But as the heavens opened and Wembley began to echo to the clatter of rain on the rows of empty plastic seats, City made their move: Mewis hoisting her towering 6ft frame skywards to meet Alex Greenwood\u2019s delivery with an imperial leap and a firm header. And not so long ago, when the relative status of these two clubs was a little more rigidly enforced, that might have been that. But Willie Kirk\u2019s squad are made of sterner stuff these days, and as they emerged for the second half with Gauvin strapped up and still moving a little gingerly, they seemed to realise that this game would be won not with the scalpel but with the hammer. The first sign that Everton had shed their earlier deference came when Egurrola\u2019s well-placed header forced Ellie Roebuck into a superb flying save. From the resulting corner Christiansen\u2019s delivery was delicious, curling towards the near post where Gauvin \u2013 still barely able to run after her injury \u2013 could simply divert the ball past Roebuck. It was fitting reward for Everton\u2019s second-half improvement, for Christiansen\u2019s increasing influence in midfield, for Gauvin\u2019s determination to play through the pain barrier. Yet as normal time wound down it was City who would assert themselves. Weir, who had earlier hit the post, would now have two golden chances to win the game in injury time. And against tiring opponents, City would carry that momentum into the extra half-hour. As Jess Park threaded the ball through for Stanway to slide home from eight yards, you could sense the deflation in Everton\u2019s demeanour and ambience: a team who in body and spirit had nothing left to give. With the last kick of the game, Beckie ran through to finish a two-on-one and secure victory. Mission accomplished for City then, who will take heart from winning when not quite at their best. Everton, for their part, learned not just how far they have come, but how far they have still to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
