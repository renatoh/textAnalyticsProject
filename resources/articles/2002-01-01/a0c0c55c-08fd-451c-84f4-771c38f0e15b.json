But one famous name has not been mentioned and that's the man I see as perfect for Old Trafford. Graeme Souness has the strength of personality, the CV and the aura to succeed Alex. There would be a natural respect from key players such as Roy Keane and, although Graeme's Liverpool connections are a stumbling block, I've always had the feeling he's a closet United fan. When I met him on holiday recently he gave me stick for not signing him when I was at Old Trafford. \"How the hell could I have signed you?\" I said. \"There's no way Liverpool would have let you out the door to join Man U.\" United fans will remember Graeme playing for and managing the arch-enemy but he's moved all over Europe since. And they shouldn't forget Sir Matt Busby had strong Liverpool connections, having played for them. Perhaps the rivalry wasn't as intense in those days. The key fact is that Graeme is a strong-minded character who's had plenty of experience and has proved he can win trophies. Virtually every club he's been at has enjoyed success. People might say he wasn't successful at Liverpool, but he won the FA Cup. His track record more than stands up to that of Martin O'Neill and David O'Leary. And when I look at the other candidates most linked with the United job I see him as the outstanding candidate. Sven-Goran Eriksson is unlikely to leave England, Ottmar Hitzfeld seems keen to stay at Bayern Munich before coaching Germany, and I have my doubts about Fabio Capello - he's a top coach but I wonder about the language barrier and whether he has such a great knowledge of the English game. Whatever anyone says, that's important. Graeme's achievements should not be underestimated. He won everything possible as a player at Liverpool, has plenty of coaching experience abroad with Galatasaray, Benfica and Torino and transformed Rangers into a club who dominated Scottish football for years. He got Blackburn promoted in his first full season and this week took them to within a whisker of their first major final since 1960. Everything at Ewood Park has been achieved without the unlimited Jack Walker funds certain of his predecessors enjoyed. Graeme is more rounded and less fiery than when he started in management. Before Liverpool came to Aston Villa in 1992, I remember, we agreed to go out after the match for a meal with our wives. Graeme was so upset at losing 4-2 that he cancelled the evening. He takes defeat badly but he's said to me that he doesn't think he'd take that problem home any more. His health scare gave him a different perspective, although United wouldn't have to worry about his heart. You couldn't find a fitter man. I think Graeme would admit he tried to change things too quickly at Liverpool. The club were going through a transition period when he arrived and top players such as John Barnes and Bruce Grobbelaar had seen better days. He should have tried to get more out of those coming to the end. But it was under him that Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman began to blossom. And people forget that life was made more difficult for him by the rule which meant you could only play a small quota of non-English players in Europe. When I took over at Villa I gave Graeme a call because I needed a left-back and he had Gary Ablett, David Burrows and Steve Staunton. I inquired about Burrows, who I thought was the most gettable, and was shocked when he said I could take Staunton. I hadn't thought there was a cat in hell's chance, but Burrows was English and Graeme wanted to keep as many English as he could. I think he's said that, of all the players he sold, Staunton was the one he really should have kept. Graeme saw, after being away, that what had once worked at Liverpool would not work in the future. He was maybe keen to bring in stronger discipline. The irony is, that's what G\u00e9rard Houllier is being feted for now. As for succeeding Fergie, Graeme has a lot of Alex's traits. He's got that Scottish passion, he likes the game played the correct way - the Old Trafford way - and he's not afraid of confrontation. Signing Maurice Johnston at Rangers showed how brave he can be. Is United's board brave enough to give him the job? \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
