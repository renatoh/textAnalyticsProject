Only history will tell who prevails. It all began in December 2005, when the Duke of Westminster, property tycoon extraordinaire and one of the richest men in Britain, acquired two famous flea markets in Paris, Paul Bert and Serpette, in Les Puces de Saint Ouen. Perhaps the Englishman thought he was merely adding another leaf to his \u00a3350m portfolio of French properties - to beef up his \u00a37bn estate. In truth, he was buying a piece of Parisian heritage and history, a transaction with which came moral duties. But capitalism hardly trades in morals. The duke assured Parisians that he would respect and protect the spirit of Les Puces - only to announce, a year later, the renegotiation of his 420 tenants' leases with rent increases of between 35% and 70%. Last week a spokesman from his family-named firm, Grosvenor Continental Europe, tried to justify such a decision and explained, using a euphemism loved by venture capitalists, that this would make the flea markets \"more dynamic\". As if working 14 hours a day in the open air, braving downpour, bitter winter cold or scorching summer heat reeked of indolence. And so his tenants have taken the duke to court, challenging the legality of the rent rise. But if he has his way, Les Puces will slowly disappear and give way to a shopping mall selling premium art deco for rich tourists and, in time, high-rise office blocks. Just think of it, 8,300 square metres of land covered with 120-year-old wooden and brick shacks, at the door of Montmartre. Enough to make any aristocrat drool. But the duke surely kept his cool, biding his time. Now he has made his move. Monsieur Gros Veneur (the name of the duke's family is derived from the Norman French for master hunter) would find it difficult to see the problem. What's wrong with commoditising culture, people and history? Let me put it differently: how would you like Roman Abramovich buying Blenheim Palace, turning this gem of British history into a theme park, and a few years later into luxury flats - for the simple reason that it makes financial sense? Perhaps you think this comparison between a flea market and Blenheim far-fetched. Think again. In a republic that guillotined its aristocracy, a flea market is its people's castle. As we marvel at the objects craftsmen from all countries and centuries have made, we get the best lessons in art history, and for free. Some of us cannot afford to buy the antiques, or even the junk, on display, but it doesn't matter. Browsing through the stalls offers the greatest pleasure and inspiration. I haven't encountered a single vendor who was not also an artist. The ingeniousness they show in transforming shacks into works of art is stunning, and their talent for lighting and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne leaves visitors in awe. We may not be able to afford that belle \u00e9poque pissoti\u00e8re which would look so good in our garden, if we had one, but we can always find solace in a boiled egg and a coffee while listening to jazz sessions in one of the little cafes of Rue des Rosiers - all for less than a fiver. For these reasons, every weekend tourists, millionaires, art lovers, beggars, celebrities, thieves and ordinary citizens flock to Les Puces de Saint Ouen. Every weekend we can't help but admire those vendors who, ensconced in multiple layers of woollies, their fingers blue and their noses red, play cards while munching saucisson, waiting for those who will make their day. For 120 years they certainly have made ours. So back off, Duke, and pardon our French, but passion is not for sale. \u00b7 Agn\u00e8s Poirier is the author of Touch\u00e9, a French woman's take on the English Agnespoirier.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
