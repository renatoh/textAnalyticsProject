Judgment in the case is expected on Monday or Tuesday by the federation's own judge. At that point, Veron and Lazio are entitled to appeal against the verdict at a federation appeals hearing likely to be held within two or three weeks. Although yesterday's hearing, at which Veron was questioned for three hours, recommended he be given a two-year ban for alleged passport fraud, that is in no way binding. When Italian football's so-called \"Federal Court\" issues its sentence next week, it can chose either to ignore or to implement the recommended punishment. Precedent suggests the eventual ban will be less than two years. United have reportedly made it clear that they will not buy Veron if the Argentina midfielder receives a ban in excess of six months. Fifa yesterday said that if he is found guilty his suspension would apply worldwide. Veron, along with Lazio's owner Sergio Cragnotti and two other club officials, is accused of \"document falsification\" regarding his request for an Italian passport. The prosecutor at the federation's hearing recommended that Veron, Cragnotti and the club officials be banned for two years and that Lazio be fined \u00a3950,000. Now Cragnotti is threatening legal action. \"If the outcome of this hearing is negative, then the federation had better understand that Lazio will resort immediately to the state judiciary. Veron represents an asset worth \u00a335m,\" he said. \"Neither Veron nor Lazio has committed any fraudulent act. If this goes to a state court, the judge would rule in our favour. At that point, the federation would have to pay us a lot of damages.\" Veron last night pleaded his innocence, claiming that he had never obtained an Italian passport or been classified as a European Union player on Lazio teamsheets. \"I came here today to find out just who has set up this whole scam,\" he said. \"I am proud of being a non-EU player and I myself never asked for an Italian passport. I feel I have been betrayed by the people who handled this whole business [the request for an Italian passport].\" Veron is also due to appear in an Italian court on October 11 to face charges of gaining an Italian passport through false documentation. Lazio are believed to have agreed a British record deal with United. The Rome club need a big sale this summer, prompting them to put the playmaker on the market. Despite interest from Real Madrid and Internazionale, United now look the most likely destination for Veron, who has reportedly agreed an annual after-tax salary worth \u00a32.3m. But last night the player said he was staying with Lazio, at least for the moment. \"I'm not leaving. I want to wait and see what happens here.\" Fifa have extended Frank de Boer's one-year European ban worldwide, effectively ruling Holland's captain out of the remaining World Cup qualifiers and next summer's finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
