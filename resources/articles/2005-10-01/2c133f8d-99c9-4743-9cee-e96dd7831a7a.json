Your boss's birthday is coming up so you decide to do an office whip-round to buy a cake. Little do you realise quite what you've started. Because, unless your company comprises just you and your boss, there will be other people in your office, and the thing about people is that each and every one of them has a birthday. And people don't like to feel left out. Before you know it, what was meant to be a one-off celebration has escalated into a fortnightly occurrence. And guess who gets to be the skivvy? For starters, there's the whip-round: the initial, optimistic email, followed by the plaintive appeals to non-compliant individuals, and finally the pointed, overly loud comments about the lack of cash in the cake envelope. Then, once the pennies (because pennies are all you will get) have been counted, you've got to bear in mind Susan's nut allergy, Becky's pathological hatred of fruit cake and Mark's chocolate-induced earaches before you can phone the cake shop. Having ordered the blandest cake known to man, guess who has to spend their lunch hour traipsing to the shop to collect it? Then there's the journey back to the office clutching one of those oh-so-cleverly-designed paper cake bags, except that apparently no one gave any thought to the handles, so you have to stretch your hands way beyond their natural capacity and by the time you get back to the office you've lost all feeling in your fingers. You then creep around beneath your colleagues' desks trying to find somewhere to hide the blasted thing until the allotted celebration time. It doesn't fit inside the teeny office fridge - and even if it did, a selection of out-of-date sandwiches seems to have taken up long-term residence there, and you don't want a cake smelling of rotting tuna. Then 4pm arrives and it's Ta-daaa, Happy Birthday! Everybody gathers around and looks with casual anticipation at the cake. Somebody will be in charge of operations, they think. All eyes turn to you. Ah, of course, the cake needs slicing. You smile through gritted teeth. So it's not enough that you collected the money, ordered the cake, picked it up from the shop and found somewhere to hide it. You are also expected to slice the thing? Anybody got a knife to hand? Much rooting around in desk drawers and pen pots ensues, but an assortment of dirty plastic cutlery is the best they can do. So, off you go to the canteen to see if you can beg, borrow or steal a proper knife. As you race back up the stairs, brandishing the knife, and receiving a few startled looks on the way, an alternative use for your newly acquired piece of cutlery crosses your mind ... While you've been on your knife hunt, another oversight has come to light: no napkins. All eyes return to you. It truly is a one-woman show. Luckily, the ladies' toilet does a good line in paper towels. At last, the slicing of the cake. Unless maths is your forte, this is where things can get tricky. Start slicing from the middle of the cake outwards and continue in that vein, and the slices get smaller and smaller as it dawns on you just how many people it has to feed. So, the gannets at the beginning of the queue do rather well, while those who have politely held back get only a sliver, or even half a sliver. It certainly doesn't pay to be meek in the dog-eat-dog world of office birthdays. The experienced cake-slicer, however, boldly cuts the cake in half, then quarters, then eighths, then 16ths. Even 32nds if it needs to go further. Then everybody's happy, or nobody is. By the time you get to your slice and grab a glass to raise, most people have gobbled theirs down and got back to work. Note to self: stick to cards in your next job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
