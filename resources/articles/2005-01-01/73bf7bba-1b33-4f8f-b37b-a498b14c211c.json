It could be a turning point for Indonesia's armed forces and newly elected President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, both with the international community and the Acehnese, who have fought a 28-year campaign for independence. Thousands of civilians in Aceh have been killed in the conflict between Gam - the Free Aceh Movement - and the Indonesian government. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have charted unlawful killings and disappearances carried out by Indonesian security forces. \"It's an excellent opportunity for the army to be heroes rather than villains,\" said one Jakarta-based western diplomat. \"They're out there doing the most dirty of the jobs, burying the bodies, often with their own hands while they've lost their own families.\" Britain and the US have reduced links with Indonesia's military since 1999 when troops took part in the killing of about 1,500 people and the displacement of 250,000 East Timorese. Kusnanto Anggoro, a military analyst at Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, believes any gain will depend on the discipline of the forces on the ground. In some areas discipline has already started to crack. Local media have reported troops demanding money from disaster victims for aid, body removal and fast-tracking on to evacuation flights. The commander of the relief effort, Major General Bambang Darmono, insists corruption of the aid effort will not be tolerated. \"I will take the sternest action possible against any soldier who is found to have taken money or aid meant for the disaster victims,\" he said. The leadership in exile of the Acehnese rebel movement said yesterday one benefit of the catastrophe was the opening up to the world of a province which has been under martial law for nearly two years. Malik Mahmud, prime minister of the Aceh independence movement since 2002, said: \"The Indonesians have been reluctant to do this, but they had no choice and I think it will be very difficult for them to shut Aceh off again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
