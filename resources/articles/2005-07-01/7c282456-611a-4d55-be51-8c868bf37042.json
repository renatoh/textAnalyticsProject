The world's second largest stock market listed tobacco group wants to end 90 years of cigarette production in Southampton where 530 jobs will go. The closure of the plant comes ahead of the introduction of a new EU directive which the company said prohibited the manufacture of high tar and nicotine products for export. The company said Switzerland, Poland and Romania - where the plant's production is being moved - were exempt from the directive. A further 66 jobs are likely to be lost in Dundalk, Ireland, where BAT blamed increased excise duty and the smoking ban in public places for the need to end manufacturing at the PJ Carroll factory. BAT has been making cigarettes in Southampton since 1913. The factory was upgraded 10 years ago and makes Lucky Strike, State Express 555, Dunhill and Rothmans, largely for export. But it is operating at half its capacity of 50bn cigarettes a year. Last month the company announced that 25% of Southampton's production was to be transferred to Singapore and Korea. The company said it would begin consultations on its plan to shut the two factories. Union officials reacted angrily, insisting they had been given only 30 minutes warning that the closures were being considered. Iain MacLean, Amicus national officer, said: \"It is very sad that companies like BAT have found it difficult to operate in the UK and that the meltdown in manufacturing here is continuing. \"This is devastating news for the workers and their families. BAT is one of the biggest employers in Southampton and I am extremely disappointed that the company has decided to end production at the plant.\" While Amicus had known that the future of the Southampton site was being reviewed, particularly following the move last month to shift some of the production to Asia, the union had not expected a complete end to manufacturing. BAT will need to spend \u00a3160m on restructuring the operations with the hope of making annual savings of \u00a340m. Allan Short, head of BAT's UK and Ireland operations, said: \"Regrettably, higher costs in western Europe and the increasing trend towards local production have combined to turn the tide against our manufacturing operations in the UK and Ireland.\" Some 90% of the tobacco products made in Southampton are exported, mostly to countries outside the EU. The company employs 1,000 at Southampton but insisted that the only jobs affected would be 530 employed in manufacturing. The plant currently makes 24bn cigarettes a year and its future volume would be below 14.5bn. The Southampton factory is earmarked for closure within 18 months to two years. A tobacco processing plant in Corby is not affected. BAT announced the closure of its Spennymoor factory in Durham in 1999 and the closure of a plant in Darlington two years ago. The Dundalk factory is running at 45% of capacity and manufactures Carroll's No 1, Major and Sweet Afton for domestic consumption. BAT's shares ended 14p lower at \u00a310.70."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
