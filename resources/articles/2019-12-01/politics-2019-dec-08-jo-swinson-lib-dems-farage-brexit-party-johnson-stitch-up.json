In an interview with the Observer, Swinson said that her party\u2019s strategy had been affected by a \u201ccosy stitch-up\u201d that saw Nigel Farage\u2019s party stand down in Tory-held seats. She said the party was now concentrating on \u201cdozens of byelections across the country\u201d that could still deliver new Lib Dem MPs and topple some big-name Conservatives on election night. She also predicted that Johnson would be toppled as Tory leader should he fail to win a majority. Swinson\u2019s remarks come as concerns build within the Lib Dems over the party\u2019s prospects on polling day. Insiders were hoping in the summer that a major breakthrough could be possible, with well over 100 seats in play. \u201cWe had polling internally \u2013 but there was public polling as well \u2013 that showed that in a scenario where you have the Lib Dems, Labour, the Tories and the Brexit party all around 20% with a few of the other parties, then in a first-past-the-post system that can create a lot of volatility,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cosy stitch-up between Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson told us two things. It did make the electoral arithmetic much more difficult. The second thing is it shows quite how far Boris Johnson\u2019s party has moved to the extreme. There are clearly many seats that are Tory-held that we\u2019d have had a much better chance of winning had the Brexit party not stood aside for the Conservatives.\u201d Swinson, who was only elected Lib Dem leader in July, said she was enjoying the campaign, despite some bruising encounters, including a BBC Question Time grilling that saw voters take issue with her party\u2019s plan to revoke Brexit without a referendum should it win a majority. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously all very quick, and intense and enjoyable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m basically still at the stage of recruiting my team in the middle of a general election campaign. It\u2019s obviously unusual to be fighting an election so soon after becoming leader, but it\u2019s also a great opportunity to meet people, get right across the country. In at the deep end.\u201d She said the most frustrating part of the campaign had been her exclusion from TV debates with Johnson and Corbyn. \u201cEarly on in this campaign, why did we go to court over the debates? Because that sets a framework on how people view the election.\u201d She said she did not regret her party\u2019s controversial policy on revoking Brexit. \u201cI think we\u2019re being honest, I think we\u2019re being clear. I think that\u2019s important in an election where the prime minister\u2019s running away from answering questions and the leader of the opposition is sitting on the fence and acting like a bystander.\u201d Swinson insisted she had her sights on creating some of the most memorable moments on election night \u2013 including the chance to unseat foreign secretary Dominic Raab. \u201cI\u2019m still very confident that we can win more seats and particularly make some quite spectacular gains in places like Esher and Walton and so much will depend on what people who are Labour supporters in Esher and Walton do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a chance for the 2019 Portillo moment being the Raab moment.\u201d Swinson even hinted that voters in Uxbridge should vote tactically to oust Johnson from his seat. Voting tactically in Uxbridge means voting for Labour. \u201cLook, I\u2019m the leader of the Lib Dems,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be surprised that I\u2019m clearly going to encourage people to vote Liberal Democrat. What I would say is obviously individuals will look at what is happening in their constituency \u2026 I understand that tactical voting is part of our voting system, because it\u2019s a rubbish voting system. \u201cOne of the ways in which people can use that voting system to deliver more of what they want is to consider voting tactically. If you\u2019ve been getting loads of Lib Dem leaflets through your door, that\u2019s a pretty good sign that you\u2019re living somewhere where the Liberal Democrats have a pretty good chance of winning.\u201d Asked if voters in Uxbridge will be receiving lots of Lib Dem leaflets, she said: \u201cThey will have to consider whether that is the case and they will know best.\u201d She urged voters put off by the choice on offer not to despair. \u201cPeople have power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do have a choice to make and they do not need to give Boris Johnson untrammelled power. He needs to be stopped and if he can be prevented from winning a majority, it\u2019s entirely possible he won\u2019t be the leader of the Conservative party either, so we can stop Boris Johnson.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
