Baker, who edited Company for five years and has also worked for J17 and Minx magazines, takes over as editor of Cosmopolitan next month after taking six months out to write her first novel. \"Sam was a brilliant editor for us on Company and I was so pleased we were able to lure her back. I think it was the only job she would have come back for,\" said Duncan Edwards, the managing director of NatMags. Baker replaces the former editor-in-chief Lorraine Candy, who left two months ago run Elle - the women's monthly fashion magazine owned by rival French publisher Hachette Filipacchi. Baker edited Company magazine between November 1998 and December 2003. She left in December to work on her first novel, Fashion Victim, which is now complete. Today she described the appointment as a \"dream come true\". \"I have been a huge fan of Cosmo since I was a student, when my flatmates and I used to take it in turns to buy it each month. This is quite simply a dream come true, Cosmopolitan is the biggest and most important magazine brand in the world and I can't wait to get started,\" she said. Publisher Jan Adcock said the company was planning \"significant investment\" for the Cosmopolitan brand, which was overtaken as Britain's best selling women's monthly magazine by Glamour in 2002. \"Competition for the role of editor was extremely tough, but Sam's insight into women's lives and understanding of Cosmopolitan cemented our decision,\" she said. \"We are planning a significant investment in the brand and Sam will be working closely with myself and the team to make the coming months some of the most exciting in Cosmo's history.\" Cosmopolitan's last Audit Bureau of Circulations figures showed the magazine's sales down slightly on the year before. NatMags has been experimenting with its own handbag-sized version of the magazine, sold through WH Smith in railway stations and airports. Baker began her career as a features writer on women's magazines, becoming features editor of Emap's New Woman in 1993. She was promoted to deputy editor and became editor of the recently closed J17 magazine in 1996. In 1998 she took over as editor of Company. She will take up her new role on 5 July. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
