Our reputation, for a start", "bodyText": "Margaret Thatcher's favourite television show was Yes, Minister, which was a parody of hapless politicians and devious civil servants. Some producers are reviving the show, and they have imagined a meeting between a minister for universities and a permanent under-secretary. I reproduce a scene: Permanent under-secretary: Interesting news minister, we can undermine Bath University. Minister: Is that one of those elite places where the students can both read and write? PUS: I'm afraid so. They came ninth in the Guardian league tables. But Bath College of Higher Education wants to become a university, and it has applied to be called Bath Spa University. Minister: Anything elite about them? PUS: No, minister. They've signed up to the widening participation agenda and Offa love them. So if we call them Bath Spa, the confusion of names can only obscure Bath's reputation for world-class research excellence. Minister: Wonderful. On behalf of the privy council I name this university Bath Spa. May God bless all those who matriculate from it. The script is obviously outrageous. Ministers and civil servants care about social justice, but they would never consciously undermine excellence. Yet the joke builds on the dissonance between objectivity and subjectivity. When it comes to naming new universities, ministers and civil servants do objectively undercut excellence, even if subjectively they are trying only to foster equality of educational opportunity. Because universities are medieval institutions, their names remain in the gift of the privy council. The privy council sounds grand, but in practice it's just a minister taking a decision. Yet, for ministers, universities' names are a nuisance. Governments have important things to worry about, so in countries where ministers are properly powerful the universities are named rationally. Paris's universities, for example, go by the names of Paris 1, Paris 2, Paris 3 etc. But, in Britain, governments sometimes feel accountable to the electorate, so they defer to sentimentality and confer names. What happens is this. A new university (Bath Spa for example) chooses a new name. It submits it to the privy council, the council forwards it to the ministry of education (or whatever the ministry is called that week), the civil servants consult possible objectors (Bath University, for example), the ministry ignores the objections and Bath Spa becomes Bath Spa. And Bath is thus undermined. Clearly, a potential student from abroad could confuse Bath University with Bath Spa University. Since Bath University's closest railway station is called Bath Spa, the confusion could even survive a brief visit to the town. We too have been undermined. Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College (BCUC) recently applied to become Buckinghamshire New University. The privy council consulted us, we explained that our two institutions were already endlessly confused (not just by students coming to the wrong town but even, on occasion, by UUK and the Sunday Times university guide), whereupon BCUC promptly became Buckinghamshire New University. To further confuse, it will also use Bucks New University. Ernst and Young, the accountancy firm, has just published an analysis of how universities flourish. Entitled The New World Order for Higher Education, the report found that a university's greatest need is for \"a well-differentiated brand\". So how are Bath and Buckingham to flourish if the government undermines their names? The system demands reform. There is something truly medieval about ministers naming universities privily. We should remove this power. The Quality Assurance Agency would do a more accountable job, and since the QAA has already assumed many of the privy council's responsibilities, that would seem a natural progression. Otherwise, this may be the next scene: PUS: The South Ken Academy of Rap and House wants to change its name to the Imperial College of Science, Technology, Medicine and Music. Minister: Marvellous. \u00b7 Terence Kealey is the vice-chancellor of, er, the University of Buckingham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
