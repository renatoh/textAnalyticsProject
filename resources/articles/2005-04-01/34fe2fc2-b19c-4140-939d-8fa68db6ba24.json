The Financial Services Authority announced on 24 December it had reached agreement with 18 firms to resolve its investigation into certain fund managers who were said to have colluded to invest in each others' funds in a bid to boost their share price. At the time Exeter was excluded from paying a settlement because the management company said it could not contribute enough to the compensation package. But after negotiations with the FSA, it has agreed to make a contribution of \u00a31 million. Those who are eligible for a share include people who invested in the zero dividend preference shares of the company's Financials Fund, its Equity Growth &amp; Income Fund and its Smaller Companies Fund. The company managing the settlement fund, Fund Distribution Ltd, says investors will be invited to apply for the money by the end of April, but in the meantime those who think they may be eligible should register their interest via its website at www.funddistribution.org. However, the FSA says that the money contributed by Exeter is likely to have a 'limited effect' on the level of recovery for eligible investors. Higher cost of lower rates Credit cards with a lower interest rate could cost you more in repayments than those with a higher advertised rate, says online comparison service uSwitch.com. This situation comes about because of the different ways the interest is calculated by credit card providers, with some offering more interest-free days than others and some charging interest on a purchase sooner than others. 'This complicated calculation process is extremely unfair on consumers as many won't know about these differences and card companies rely on this ignorance to increase their profits,' says Nick White, head of personal finance at uSwitch. Last week the government rejected a parliamentary committee's recommendation that credit card companies should all use a single method to calculate interest, concluding that this would stifle competition. Enduring confusion Banks are letting elderly and disabled customers down by failing to train staff in what to do when these customers appoint another person to run their financial affairs, the Law Society has told Cash. Staff are proving ignorant about an enduring power of attorney (EPA), with four out of five solicitors surveyed saying they believe banks take inconsistent approaches. An EPA is granted when a person is concerned that they may become physically or mentally disabled and appoints another person to handle their financial affairs if that happens. An EPA can operate while someone is still able to handle their own affairs, although if they become mentally incapacitated the EPA must be registered with the Court of Protection. 'Banks often assume that if you have taken out an EPA than you are mentally incapable, but this is not always the case and can cause a number of problems,' said Meg Andrews, chair of the Law Society's wills and equitable committee. 'A customer may have a physical disability and have taken out an EPA so that their banking needs can be sorted out by a third party, while some people simply take one out as an insurance policy against failing health in the future.' Disabled can save on council tax Families with disabled children, many of them living on below-average incomes, are often failing to claim the reductions on council tax they may be entitled to, say charities Contact A Family and Whizz-Kidz. To qualify for a disability reduction on bills, households must include a disabled child or adult who uses a wheelchair indoors, needs a second bathroom, toilet or kitchen or who is the main user of one room, either as a living space for treatment or to store equipment. These families, or individuals, could reduce their council tax bills by one band regardless of their income or savings. 'As a national disability charity, we are aware that the cost of bringing up a disabled child is three times that of bringing up a non-disabled child, so the rising cost of council taxes could really affect these families,' said Whizz-Kidz chief executive Ruth Owen.
