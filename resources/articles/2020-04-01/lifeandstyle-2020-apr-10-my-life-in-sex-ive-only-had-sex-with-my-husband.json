Twelve years later, I have chosen to express myself sexually only with him. I\u2019m a Christian, and I believe that Jesus loves us by giving himself to us unconditionally. By replicating that kind of love in my sex life, I am growing to understand God\u2019s love more. It\u2019s not a question of moral purity so much as modelling to each other what we believe God is like. In my celibate 20s, friends struggled to understand my decision. They\u2019d question why I was so old-fashioned, and reassure me that I didn\u2019t have to live that way. But waiting didn\u2019t feel like deprivation. I lived a full and happy decade, and didn\u2019t need to derive my value from sex. That\u2019s not because I\u2019m prudish or asexual. Since marrying my husband, we\u2019ve enjoyed a loving, intimate, fun sex life. It\u2019s changed over the years, but remains a source of great pleasure and trust. We believe the fact that we made a commitment to each other before we were intimate has created the safety that we experience together. People wonder whether we feel we missed out. Would I have been more \u201ccompatible\u201d with someone else? How do I know I couldn\u2019t have had better sex elsewhere, without giving it a go? But that\u2019s been the point, really: we\u2019ve been free to love and enjoy each other sexually without fear of any comparisons. I don\u2019t have to worry that I\u2019m not as good a performer as others. It\u2019s only been me. Together we enjoy sex as something amazing \u2013 not to be entrusted lightly. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
