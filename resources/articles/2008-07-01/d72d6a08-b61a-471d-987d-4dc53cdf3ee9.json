The link isn't, I think, a mere film-nerd footnote. The vocal echo makes sense: the Old Testament names Daniel and Noah suggest how, recent as the past being dealt with is \u2013 1898-1927 in Blood, the 1930s in Chinatown \u2013 that can count as ancient history, as a kind of tribal, ancestral legend, in so newly modernised a territory as California. These are the founding fathers, and although the Western frontier was declared closed in the 1890s, their magnificent, sinister achievement is, by stamping their will on California's land and people, to dominate what Cross calls \"The future, Mr. Gittes, the future!\" These are elemental stories. Paul Thomas Anderson's brave, intensely disturbing, all too timely Californian epic of the early days of the oil business is based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, and correspondingly one of its dominant images is of fire; while Chinatown, from Robert Towne's original script, is all about Water \u2013 as a source of life, a commodity, a means to power \u2013 and as an image that runs right through the film. (In the sequel to Chinatown, The Two Jakes, incidentally, oil turns out to be the driving force in the plot.) In both films the patriarch embodies a capitalist will to power and ruthless expansion, seen as a kind of primal madness. Digressing a moment to add another element \u2013 the air \u2013 we could add the New Yorker Scorsese's own contribution to the sub-genre of Californian capitalist epic, his exhilarating Howard Hughes movie The Aviator. If Noah Cross is pretty clearly a villain, and Daniel Plainview at best an anti-hero, Scorsese's Hughes, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, after all, might appear to be more like a conventional hero \u2013 he starts as an underdog, and heroically overcomes huge obstacles en route to world domination. We certainly root for him in his majestic performance in the Senate hearings, and against his splendidly hateful competitor Alec Baldwin. But Scorsese, who thinks of American directors as smugglers of non-obvious subversive arguments and analyses, builds up a picture of Hughes's private insanity and drivenness which suggests that the corporate-technological modernity we're still increasingly experiencing has been shaped by something dark and out of control. Like Cross, Hughes ends by signalling his interest in us, in posterity: his way, he declares, resoundingly, is \"the way of the future\". Both Daniel and Noah in their different ways disfigure their own families. These movies are foundation myths, and there's something allegorical about the tragic distortion of family relations in both. In his overweening desire to dominate and possess Noah Cross sleeps with and impregnates his own daughter Evelyn (Faye Dunaway), so that the resulting child is both his daughter and granddaughter. It ends, unforgettably, in bloody destruction \u2013 but not (capitalists are survivors) of Cross himself. The apparently sexless Daniel Plainview has no real family, only surrogates: the adoptive orphan H.W. (Dillon Freasier), whom he pretends is his son (he needs \"a sweet face to buy land\", as he brutally says); the haunting, gentle stranger (Kevin J. O'Connor) who pretends to him that he is his long-lost half-brother Henry; and then Eli (Paul Dano), the charismatic young preacher whose weirdly ambivalent quasi-Oedipal relation with the violently atheistic Daniel seems a metaphor for the queasy relation between capitalist greed and religion in America. Of these three intimate ties, none survives at the end: Daniel has laid waste to all around him. There Will Be Blood and Chinatown both look back to the time when California was uncultivated, or unspoilt \u2013 a blank slate, often a mere desert. They present and dramatise, and problematise, the process by which money and power transform the original landscapes of what used to seem a paradise into corporate domains \u2013 owned, overbuilt, profit-yielding properties that have been wrenched by fraud, strength and cunning from original small-holders (the dodgy acquisition of land is a focus in both). To construct their stories of how California so quickly came to be what it is today, they individualise and pathologise the drive to power. In Anderson's disconcerting anti-epic, mining becomes an image of the human urge to dominate the earth \u2013 the blasting and drilling of the land to gouge out silver and oil, a dirty process that also involves as his title implies the shedding of a good deal of blood. In this respect, it looks back to the father of all Californian capitalist sagas, made three years before the action of Blood Will Have Blood finishes. Greed, Erich Von Stroheim's ill-fated silent masterpiece of 1924, was cut down by MGM from nine hours to just over two. Greed, based on the naturalist novel McTeague (1899) by Sinclair's contemporary Frank Norris, takes gold as its element \u2013 symbolically linking mining (McTeague's first job), dentistry (his second) and the all-distorting fact of money \u2013 and like Anderson's film follows through to its logical conclusion the murderous competitive drives of its central character (they're also alike in their minute attention to the realistic details of their protagonists' trades). Greed's tale of atavistic appetites and competitive rivalries culminates in an absurd, murderous fight \u2013 an image of human fatuity, bringing mutually assured destruction \u2013 in the middle of the baking, dry-as-a-bone Death Valley. That scene \u2013 two tiny figures, slugging it out to extinction in the middle of a white, horrifyingly alien blankness \u2013 might be the emblem of these bleak, visionary, thought-provoking films."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
