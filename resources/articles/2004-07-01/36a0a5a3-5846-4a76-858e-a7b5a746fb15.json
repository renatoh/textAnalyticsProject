The versatile teenager is understood to have signed a five-year contract with United after also being pursued by Arsenal and Chelsea, likely title rivals to Sir Alex Ferguson's team next season. The fee is not known. Although Piqu\u00e9 is expected to spend most of his first year at United's youth academy, he is optimistic about progressing through the ranks quickly, saying that Ferguson's record of blooding youngsters was one of the main reasons for exchanging Barcelona for Old Trafford. \"In England, age doesn't matter so much, while in Spain there is a structure and there are very few chances to break through,\" said the 17-year-old, who can play in the centre or left side of defence. Mark Viduka was undergoing a lengthy medical last night before his proposed \u00a33.8m transfer from Leeds to Middlesbrough. A club spokesman admitted completion was now unlikely before tomorrow at the earliest. The Danish winger Dennis Rommedahl has completed \u00a32m move to Charlton from PSV Eindhoven. Newcastle expect to announce the \u00a33.3m signing of another Leeds forward, James Milner, today. Next week is expected to see Nicky Butt's arrival on Tyneside, with the midfielder's arrival prompting Gary Speed's departure for Fulham. El Hadji Diouf and Bruno Cheyrou are close to leaving Liverpool. Diouf has attracted interest from Malaga, with the Merseyside club asking for about \u00a33m for a player who cost them \u00a310m in 2002. Cheyrou is expected to join Marseille on a season's loan. Youri Djorkaeff has rejected Bolton's offer of a new 12-month contract. \"I have to make a professional valuation and that's fallen short of what Youri thinks he is worth,\" Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce said. Southampton have signed the Swedish midfielder Mikael Nilsson, who will complete his free-transfer move from Halmstad at the start of December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
