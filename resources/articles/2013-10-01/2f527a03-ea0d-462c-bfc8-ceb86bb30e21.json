That's all from me, thanks for reading and writing everybody. Take it away Hunter... Strike three - Chambers watches a cut fastball go by, and LA have survived a threat in the ninth inning, sending this series back to St Louis! Chambers falls behind in the count 1-2... Another base hit, this one to right center field, the throw home is not in time, Adams scores and it's a two run ballgame after Kozma delivers a clutch knock! Hold everything! Rick Honeycutt is out to chat with Jansen before Adron Chambers gets set to pinch hit. He struck out off the bench last night. What will he do tonight? No, is the resounding answer - he strikes out Freese on a 96MPH fastball blazing towards the glove of Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis! It's up to Pete Kozma to keep it alive for St Louis. Base hit - and Adams goes station to station. So two on, one out and the tying run comes to the plate and it's guess who - the struggling David Freese, who knows a little something about drama going back to his big performance vs Texas in Game Six of the 2011 World Series. Can he repeat those theatrics? Jansen overpowers Molina, something I rarely expect to type - it's a here is, hit it fastball...or a cutter that didn't cut. One down, one on, here's John Jay. Now it's Matt Adams at the plate, left handed hitter facing the right handed Jansen in front of 53,183 hopeful fans at Dodger Stadium. They're less hopeful now that Adams delivers a RBI base hit. Now Molina bats with a runner on and no outs in the ninth. It's not a save situation for Jansen. Holliday hits to right field, Puig loses it in the sun, and then is slow getting to the ball - the Cards have a lead off double. Ethier strikes out and LA are three outs away from sending this series back to St Louis. Nick Punto strikes out but then Adrian Gonzalez goes deep, again, deep right field!!! That's two home runs in this game! The crowd want A-Gon to come out for a curtain call, but he resists, not wanting to disrespect the game of course. At 8PM EST and 1AM in the UK, Hunter Felt will have all the action from Detroit as the Tigers seek to level the ALCS at two games a piece in Game Four. So no reason to go away after this game, stay with us. Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen warms up as Cards skipper Mike Matheny brings in John Axford, who becomes the fifth pitcher used by St Louis in this game - Kelly, Choate, Mujica, Siegrist and now the Ontario born right handed Canadian who faces Mark Ellis. LA's second baseman bounces out to the shortstop, that's Pete Kozma, who has little trouble making the play. One down for little Nick Punto - let the drama begin. As Wilson enters, Vin is talking about his long fluffy black beard while delivering a history lesson. One of the things Black Beard did, he really didn't use force, he relied on image. Well, Wilson seems to have some force here to back that crazy thing he has going for him - the pinch hitting Daniel Descalso, in for the pitcher bounces back to Wilson who throws to first for the out, then Carpenter grounds out to second on a 94MPH fastball. Vin says: So Black Beard is still roaming the seas, the imaginary seas of Dodger Stadium... And with that, Wilson blows away Carlos Beltran, who doesn't bother offering at Wilson's slider - strike three, inning over. Well, after six of the first 12 Cardinals hit against Greinke, he came back and retired his final 13 batters. That's quite a recovery, one the Dodgers absolutely had to have. 7IP 6H 2R 2ER 1BB 4SO 0HR Siegrist strikes out Crawford to end the Cards seventh - they have six outs left, and here comes Brian Wilson to pitch for LA. Mujica's last batter is the pinch hitting Michael Young, who pinch hits for Zack Greinke signaling an end to his outing. Young lines out to center, and here comes Cardinals manager Mike Matheny to get Mujica and replace him with the lefty Kevin Siegrist. Ellis take an 0-2 pitch out of the park! Ellis crushed a hanger out and over the plate and the Dodgers catcher made Mujica pay, sending the ball into the sun-splashed bleachers in left field - now the Dodgers have three home runs this game, after having none through the first four games of this series. Mujiica is back for more and he gets Uribe to start the Dodgers seventh. He taps back to the Venezuelan hurler, who throws to first for the first out. That brings up A.J. Ellis. Hey Dodgers fans, do you still believe? More grounders, Freese and Kozma bounce out to third, and that's 13 straight now for Greinke who may now leave it to Brian Wilson and Kenley Jansen to finish off the Cards. He's on 104 pitches, will Mattingly push it? Home plate is covered in shadows, but the pitcher is in the afternoon sun. This is bad for hitters, FYI. John Jay is the 11th consecutive Cardinals hitter set down by Zack Greinke after the Cards center fielder bounces out to second base. This just in...Nick Punto has replaced Hanley Ramirez at shortstop - yes, that has finally happened and pro-Punto supporters howl in delight. The slumping Freese, also battling injury, a calf/leg issue, is up at the plate. Charles, meet Liz, Liz meet Charles. Mujica was the out of nowhere Cards closer until September when fell off the charts and started leaking runs out of nowhere - now that's Trevor Rosenthal's job. Life is cruel. Mujica does get Puig to bounce out and end the inning, which could help his psyche. To the seventh inning we go. Choate gets the two lefties, then Matheny comes and gets him. Edward Mujica is coming in to make his first appearance of the series. Choate gets another lefty, Adrian Gonzalez, to ground out to Big Matt Adams at first, and that's no easy task today - he's 2-3 with a big home run today. Next is Ethier, also batting left against the southpaw - that Mike Matheny knows what he's doing. He lines a rope, right at Kozma at short, two down. Yasiel Puig is walking into the box. You get it because he's done for the day. Not nearly good as he was in Game One, mostly because he failed to hit Yasiel Puig in the ribs. 5IP 7H 4R 4ER 0BB 3SO 2HR Lefty Randy Choate is the new pitcher for St Louis. We'll take it, believe me. Thanks Liz! Molina is toast, Greinke looks angry. A high fastball sends us to the bottom of the sixth. Greinke has four strikeouts and is up to 93 pitches. You can't fight old adages Richie, who do you think you are? Maybe it should be really really really good pitching beats really really good pitching. Adams hits one right at the man of the minute, Carl Crawford, who makes the catch to retire Adams. Molina is next. Dodgers ecstacy level climbs - they retire Matt Holliday for the first time this game on a grounder to Uribe at third. No Adams is up, and even KLAC broadcast Charley Steiner called the big Pennsylvanian \"burly\". One of these days, this guy is going to punch someone in the facce. @NotCoachTito will be the judge of that. The Dodgers are done in the fifth after Ellis skies out to John Jay in center field (he made it look easy, really, he did), and Ramirez hits a little nothing back to Kelly, who tosses to first and retires the side. All of a sudden the Dodgers can hit home runs - their timing is right. That Crawford is such a complicated fellow. After Greinke grounds out to second to lead off the inning, Carl Crawford hits a solo home run that is so long gone that Beltran doesn't even try to chase it out in right field. It came in at 96 MPH and left at about 110MPH says the Dodgers broadcaster Rick Monday. It's Crawford's fourth blast of these playoffs, and the Dodgers have their second, two-run lead of the game. Mixed results for Greinke this game - he's needed a pair of timely double plays to escape serious damage, and then he mixes in 1-2-3 innings, like he did in the Cards half of the fifth. Kelly strikes out, Carpenter and Beltran bounce to first. Here come the Dodgers... UK readers would be smart to find Nat Coombs on their radio dial. He's broadcasting this game, right now, along with Josh Chetwynd. So, listen to them, read us. Sounds like fun - I'm jealous I can't hear it here in the US, but I can't complain too much. I have TBS on the screen, and Charley Steiner and Rick Monday with Vin Scully on KLAC radio. Lot's of options! Puig leads off and watches strike three pass by, a 97MPH fastball, and the ripped Cuban does not agree in any way with that call, throwing his bat into the dugout. Kelly's velocity is showing no signs of dying down, Vin Scully saying earlier: Where in the world did the cardinals find all these young arms.Every guy they bring up throws 95 [MPH] and up! It's something we all wonder Vin. Uribe, who had a big hit in his last at-bat, grounds out to short this time around, then A.J. Ellis also bounces out, this time to third. Inning over, a strong one for Kelly. He's on 65 pitches through four innings. Jenny Spry says: Please, please, please keep your blogs going. There is no reasonable coverage in Melbourne unless you count a middle of the night replay of the previous day's game. I spent all day yesterday on the Guardian site reading the ALCS &amp; NLCS blogs. Right now I am hoping you are going to be covering the World Series - could I be so lucky? cheers and, Go Red Socks and Cards! G'day Jenny, and yes - we're pleased to say that will have every game of the World Series live - thanks for joining us! Meanwhile Resins Man points out an amusing typo I made in the top of the third, one that certainly got a laugh. To change it or not to change it... Two key plays for the Dodgers. John Jay launches a fly ball deep to center but Ethier, moving well is able to get under it for the first out. Then Ramirez makes a play at short that doesn't look awful, and it retires David Freese, who just can't get going. So the bruised and battered Dodgers get it one in the field. The traditional Dodger Stadium beach ball is on the field for a brief delay, and once it's collected, Ethier is on his horse again to track down another fly ball, this one not as deep from Pete Kozma, and Greinke takes the Cards 1-2-3 in the fourth. He needed that. Ethier bounces out to Carpenter at second, inning over, but LA retake the lead in their half of the third. Adrian Gonzalez connects for the Dodgers first home run of this series! A solo shot to deep, deep right field on a ball that Kelly left down the pipe ! LA are back on top as Dodgers fans continue to ride that roller coaster of emotions. Hanley grounds sharply to Kozma at short, he steps on the bag at second to get Ellis, survives the take out by the Dodgers second baseman, who throws to first and nails Ramirez - a 6-3 double play! Naturally, every misstep Ramirez makes will be examined over and over as the decision to start him again with a fractured rib is a contentious one. Meanwhile, Ramirez is healthy enough to trash the tub of Gatorade in the dugout. The frustration for the shortstop mounts. The Dodgers come right back with a lead off singly by Mark Ellis, and that brings up Hanley Ramirez... David Hopkins says: Having just got back to the UK from a great trip to New England, it really stood out how excitable and hyped-up the coverage of the big nightly match-ups were. And once the politicians had got over banging on about the shutdown, the coverage of the Red Sox and Patriots was quite interesting too! Caroline Hack says: Long time Braves fan living in Norfolk watching the game on the Telly (thank you BT broadband) this evening. Quite neutral this evening, but I guess if pushed probably rooting for the Dodgers to keep the series going. Top of the first was certainly an interesting start to the game! Greinke is out of trouble thanks to yet another double play! This time it's Molina who makes two outs at one time - bouncing to the pitcher, who throws to Mark Ellis at second for one, who throws to Gonzalez at first to complete the DP. That's a pretty big play, but the Cards have tied this game, and LA can't afford too many more ropey innings from anyone. Adams hits a little squibber, breaking his bat, and because the infield shit is on, Mark Ellis is out of position and can't make the play. So Adams makes measly contact, but is on first, while Holliday moves over to third. There's a meeting at the mound to try and figure out how to handle the next Cards batter, Yadier Molina, with one down and runners at the corners. Greinke is approaching 60 pitches. Here comer the Cardinals! Holliday hammers a Greinke cut fastball to left field, a one-hopper off the wall. Betran scores, and just like that, the big bats of these birds have come back to life! It's a tie ball game after Holliday's double, still just one out, Greinke struggling, and here's Matt Adams looking for more. Beltran hits a high fly ball to the deep center field, and it lands right above the 395 feet sign! Ethier falls down in pursuit, Beltran is off to the races, and Carpenter comes around to score the first Cardinal run. Beltran's run ends at third base, it's an RBI triple for the new Mr Ocotber, and St Louis are now within a sacrifice fly of tying this game! Matt Carpenter just spit in his hands and rubbed them together. How would that go down in your office? The work continues for Joe Kelly, he leads off the inning for St Louis, grounding out, right back to Greinke. Matt Carpenter, who was 1-4 last night with a double, is now 2-2 after his second base hit of the game, one to right field, where Puig is there to handle. One on, one out for Carlos Beltran, who has a certain way about him in October. Did you know blogging is a two-way street? Drop us a line with your thoughts on the game and all things baseball...or anything really. david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com Or via twitter: @lengeldavid Towels are waving \"a blizzard in the ballpark with the temperature at 82\" according to Scully. Crawford does his best to kill that buzz by striking out to end the inning, but not before the Dodgers get two runs, and make Kelly work to the tune of nearly 30 pitches. Greinke sneaks a ground ball through the left side of the infield, and that's going to score Puig! Greinke helps his own cause, knocking in a run created by Puig's ability to take third base on the prior play. That's a huge run, especially when you consider how it was created. A.J. Ellis is next, he hits a high fly ball into foul territory on the right side, and Carpenter makes a nifty over the shoulder basket catch - Puig takes off and is able to tag up to third on the play - that's heads up base running from the Cuban. Now the pitcher is up with two outs and runners at the corners. Uribe is 0-14 coming into this at bat, but he musters up a single to center field! Here comes Gonzalez and the throw is not in time! LA are first on the board! Uribe, who has been shut down since driving in two runs in Game One, comes up with a big knock! Puig comes up with an opposite field base hit that moves Adrian Gonzalez to second base. One out, two on for Juan Uribe Ethier hits a routine fly ball to Matt Holliday in left field for the first out. Here comes Yasiel Puig. Scully continues to harp on how Puig is no longer a free swinger, just as he has in previous nights. The Cuban has seen 91 pitches in 17 at-bats, which is a lot for a player who was recently hitting home runs off pitches closer to Chicago than home plate. A picture perfect swing from Adrian Gonzalez results in a lead of base hit to right field, and that's enough to get those white towels into the air as the Dodgers attempt to rally here in their half of the second inning. Andre Ethier is up. Dodgers radio voice Vin Scully is relieved that the Dodgers have shifted their giveaway towel back to white, in place of the blue \"rally towels\" from last night. Scully thought the blue didn't create the same feel as they weren't as visable. Perhaps there's something to that... Kozma hits a little knubber (that's a baseball word grammar people), and Greinke flies off the mound to his right to track down the ball. I mean, he pounced on it, like a cheetah on a zebra...or something like that. The Dodgers pitcher throws to first in time to get Kozma. Inning over. John Jay is back at plate for his first at-bat, temporarily. Greinke sets him down on strikes. Then David Freese lines out to Yasiel Puig in right center field. So two quick outs, and perhaps Greinke is done with that first inning nonsense. Pete Kozma is now at the plate. It could be another big day for big strike zones. Actually, Busfield likes the Cards, and for decent reasons. I'm sticking with my 7-1 Dodgers win, even after seeing what the Cards are capable of in the first. Hanley Ramirez is up - he and his fractured rib battle Joe Kelly. He doesn't look too bad, and works a full count before letting strike three fly by - it might have been low and away, at least Hanley thinks so, and lets home plate umpire Ted Barrett know it. I'm out here busting my ass, I can barely swing, and you call that? You know I can't reach that Ted, damn! Side retired. Mark Ellis is up - he lines sharply to shortstop, and a little leap later from Pete Kozma, the Dodgers infielder is retired. Two outs. So the Cardinals Joe Kelly is back on a Southern California mound, hailing from nearby Anaheim and Corona. The first batter he sees is Carl Crawford, who is hoping to fare better with his bat, then he did with his glove in the top of the first, which may be a bit harsh... Anyway, he bounces out to second. One down. That he does - he's also familiar with a certain Robert Andino. Greinke finds a rabbit in his hat! Molina grounds to Juan Uribe, who steps on third base for one out, fires to first to get Molina, and facing a bases loaded nobody out situation, LA escape! That is an enormous moment, a 5-3 double play, in this young game, and there's wind back in the sails at Dodger Stadium. Eben LaPier has an agenda: I think I speak for all of us in San Francisco when I hope that last year's Cardinals were a fluke. Beat LA! Greinke whiffs on a 2-2 breaking ball in the dirt, and now Greinke can get out of this with the handy help of a inning ending double play. Not so easy, here's Yadier Molina. One down, bases still loaded. From bad to worse, Matt Holliday hits it where they aint - that is the outfield, or shallow left center field more accurately, and a diving Carl Crawford came up short, while Hanley Ramirez was nowhere to be seen. The bases are loaded, no outs, for Matt Adams, and Greinke has one heck of a mess to clean up. Carpenter slices an opposite field bloop base hit into left field, so the Cards are on base straight away. The Cards second basman stands on first base, under \"a bright blue canopy overhead\" according to the legendary Dodgers broadcaster, Vin Scully. It's 82 degrees in LA today, but it may feel a bit warmer after Carlos Beltran draws a walk - the first two Cardinals have now reached base. Zack Greinke is set to try and get his Dodgers one more shot with a win in Game Five today - the first pitch to Matt Carpenter is a fastball high for ball one. We're off! That sounds like one for the Dodgers for me. I'm going to second that, mostly because I want more baseball. Don't we want more baseball? LA 7-1 - an explosion (with or without Nick Punto! It's not too late for your predictions, email: david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com Or via twitter: @lengeldavid 1. Carl Crawford, LF 2. Mark Ellis, 2B 3. Hanley Ramirez, SS 4.

The Will Ferrell is announcing the starting lineup for the Dodgers out in LA, andUS broadcaster TBS only gives us a little taste. Can someone explain that call to me please? Why? Why? Why?

Kozma is back in the starting lineup in place of Daniel Descalso. Recent history says it's actually LA that have St Louis where they want them. San Francisco came back from a 3-1 deficit to upend the Redbirds last season en route to their second title in two seasons. In 1996, St Louis had a 3-1 edge over the Atlanta Braves, but they stormed back to win that series, only to blow a two-game World Series lead to the New York Yankees. Incidentally, the stat men say St Louis were outscored 52-2 in those games following taking a 3-1 series lead. However, in the Cards previous nine elimenation games, they've won eight. Incidentally, Dodgers outfielder Skip Schumaker was on the Cards team that blew it against the Giants last season, and said: Well, we lost. Hopefully that\u2019s going to be a continuing theme. ...today, possibly tomorrow and definitely next season, so said the Los Angeles Times early in the day, declaring that sources confirmed that ownership will pick up the team option on the Dodgers skipper. He's getting some stick for removing Adrian Gonzalez from Game One for a pinch-runner, a move that backfired, and from some for not pitching Greinke in Game Four. I'm still not entirely sure what the true impact of a manager is on a ballclub, but he deserves to be back next season. Besides, who else is out there? TBS has something fun with Gary Sheffield on the pregame show here in the United States. The former, well, outspoken, MLB player is talking about how the drugs you take when your trying to cover up the pain of an injury can keep you up at night. He's very open and honest about things, and just get the feeling that at any moment he'll break out a PED regiment or talk about the best way to use greenies. Pedro Martinez is more cautious and measured - he basically thinks that Hanley shouldn't play, mostly because painkillers cover up the potential additional damage he could be doing to himself by playing, which I completely agree with. He struck out three times last night and looked as bad as you could at the plate. As much as the heart is appreciated, if I were Don Mattingly, I would save whatever is in that tank for a key at-bat, when the Dodgers are in huge trouble. Maybe there's enough to pull some kind of Kirk Gibson moment. The Los Angeles Dodgers have been in desperate situations before in 2013, but none as stark as the one they find themselves in today. Fail to garner a victory against the St Louis Cardinals in Game Five of the National League Championship Series, and their playoffs will be over. It's that simple. Back in June, with the Dodgers languishing in last place of the NL West, their wheels spinning, a squad chock full of injured players and their manager, Don Mattingly, on the verge of being fired, the Dodgers were also badly in need wins. LA responded with a once in a generation run - 42 wins in 50 games, a stretch inspired by the emergence of the 22-year-old Cuban, Yasiel Puig, whose five tools and raw enthusiasm helped to propel Los Angeles to the playoffs. That they reached the postseason helped validate the work done by the Dodgers new owners, Guggenheim Baseball Management, whose public face is former LA Lakers hall-of-fame Magic Johnson. After purchasing the team for a whopping $2.15b, the group set about undoing the damage of former hated Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who did his best to cripple the franchise. That they were able to dramatically turn their season around meant that the over $200m committed to players on the field was money well spent. Unfortunately for their ownership and fans, the playoffs are a crap shoot where payroll means nothing. And so here they are, months later, back in a desperate situation with health issues that ring familiar. The Dodgers winning percentage is above .600 with shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the lineup, below .500 without him, so it's a good sign that he's playing tonight vs the Cardinals - but after striking out three time in Game Four, how much can he contribute? Andre Ethier is still not healthy enough to play near his capabilities in center field, while Matt Kemp, his season long over, can only watch - yes, Dodger fans have seen this show before, and it doesn't end well. Even if Zack Greinke is on the mound tonight and Clayton Kershaw pitches a potential Game Six back in St Louis, LA will still need to catch more than their share of breaks to rip off three straight games against these Cardinals. St. Louis are a deserving team, loaded with talent, also benefiting from facing these Dodgers at just the right time - but don't take anything away from them. Their league leading offense is also missing a vital cog in Allen Craig, but what they have put on the field is showing signs of regaining hitting form. Matt Holliday's monster two-run home run in Game Four is proof of that, the slumping Matt Carpenter also had himself a double last night. If that hitting spreads down to through the lineup, to Yadier Molina and David Freese, the Dodgers chances for a comeback grow even slimmer. St Louis brings back one of their prized young pitchers to face Greinke in Game Five. Dodgers fans remember that Joe Kelly hit Ramirez with a pitch in the ribs in Game One, and a hostile afternoon crowd at Chavez Ravine will remind him all game as he looks to topple the Cy Young award winning Greinke yet again. Should he succeed his Cardinals will reach their fourth World Series in nine seasons.
