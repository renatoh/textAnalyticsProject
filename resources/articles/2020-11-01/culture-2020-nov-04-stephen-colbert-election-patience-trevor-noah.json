That outcome looked likely on Tuesday night, as Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah hosted late-night specials for a presidential election whose result remains, as of this writing, unknown. Stephen Colbert On Showtime, Stephen Colbert hosted his two-hour Election Night Special: Democracy\u2019s Last Stand for a \u201cweird fucking election\u201d with a trickle of results. Four years after \u201cquite famously a painful experience\u201d in which the host, his audience and crew processed the shock of a Trump victory in real time, Colbert mostly braced for any outcome. This time, there were few surprising results to work with, other than the eventual call of Ohio for Trump \u2013 usually a bellwether swing state that went from \u201cBuckeye state from the \u2018fuck why?\u2019 state\u201d, Colbert joked. After two hours of election coverage \u2013 checking in with the CBS news desk, virtual interviews with the hosts of political cable show The Circus and radio host Charlamagne tha God, even a performance by Arcade Fire \u2013 Colbert had little to offer other than chastened uncertainty. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know who\u2019s won,\u201d the host relayed at about 1am Eastern Time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this for so long \u2013 it\u2019s like Christmas Eve, and not just because of the judgmental fat guy with the red hat. But because we\u2019re all up late wondering if tomorrow morning we\u2019re going to get the present we\u2019ve been begging for: a boring president. \u201cLike you, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Colbert continued, adding that he had been on \u201chigh alert\u201d since the morning of 9 November 2016. \u201cNow, my blood pressure is within normal range \u2013 for a truck tire. You could roll my aorta over a gravel road, I wouldn\u2019t feel a bump,\u201d he joked. \u201cFor four years, Trump has kept this entire nation\u2019s emotional meter hovering over in the red zone. And every time you think you can take your foot off the gas, a caravan of Trump trucks tries to run you off the road,\u201d he added, referring to a group of armed pickup trucks with Trump flags that surrounded a bus of Biden-Harris supporters in Texas over the weekend. Colbert signed off with a call for patience: \u201cIt\u2019s actually a good thing we don\u2019t know who won yet.\u201d The delays in official returns stemmed in large part from record voter turnout, probably the highest percentage since 1908. \u201cThe point is: this year millions of you braved the pandemic, an army of poll watchers, even the post office, just to make sure you got to vote,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cEach and every one of those ballots deserves to be counted, whether they are votes for Joe Biden, votes for Donald Trump, or write-in votes for \u2018boobs boobs boobs Post Malone rulez!!!\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to wait for this moment since November 2016, and many of you waited in line for hours to make your voices heard,\u201d he concluded. \u201cSo I know we\u2019ve all got what it takes to wait a little bit longer.\u201d Trevor Noah On Comedy Central, Trevor Noah hosted the Daily Show\u2019s Votegasm 2020: What Could Go Wrong? (Again) from an \u201celection fallout shelter\u201d stocked with \u201ceverything I need if shit goes down, which it probably will\u201d, including board games, toilet paper, hand sanitizer and whiskey. For an hour, as results from non-swing states trickled in and Florida and Ohio appeared to lean Trump (both have since been called for the president), Noah reflected on a chaotic, draining election season with numerous correspondents and guests, including the University of North Carolina sociology professor and 2020 MacArthur Genius Grant winner Tressie McMillan Cottom. When asked by Noah why, at around 11.45pm ET, to make sense of a confounding election, Cottom responded: \u201cSo far tonight, it\u2019s going mighty white-ly. \u201cFor all of the impressive get-out-the-vote that happened on the Democratic side,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich I do think we\u2019ll continue to see the fruits of over the next couple of days, the fact remains that we\u2019re not going to see a clear repudiation of Donald Trump by the Republican party.\u201d \u201cThat means that no matter who wins today, tomorrow, next week, whenever this thing finally ends, we are still living in the United States of America where 40-45% of the population thinks that Donald Trump has been doing a really good job,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be really difficult to govern no matter who is elected.\u201d At the end of the hour and with potential days to go before a definitive call, Noah deferred to the Daily Show\u2019s weeklong election coverage, since \u201cshit is gonna go for awhile, people, brace yourselves! \u201cEvery day we\u2019re going to be counting the votes, and then after that we\u2019re going to be following the lawsuits,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cSo get some rest, sober up and we\u2019ll catch you again tomorrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
