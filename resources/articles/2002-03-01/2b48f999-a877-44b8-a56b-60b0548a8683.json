They are then at an age to appreciate the experience, and there are obvious dangers and tropical diseases to protect against. Also, safaris usually involve long periods in 4x4 vehicles, which can be boring for kids! Having said that, if you are determined to go ahead there are safari destinations in Tanzania where children are welcomed. One is the Selous Game Reserve, where Mbuyu Safari camp \"are happy to accept pre-scool age children\". They add that children cannot be left alone in the tent and one adult must be present at all times. One advantage here is that most people fly in so you avoid a long road safari - the disadvantage is that children usually pay adult air fare, unless babes in arms. On the plus side, children under six have free accommodation. Selous is a magnificent wilderness area centred on the Rufiji river and activities include game drives, boat safaris and walking with an armed guard (adults only). It is not cheap, however, at \u00a3180 per person per day - full board accommodation, sharing a luxury tent and two safari activities per day. Internal flights extra. Most people stay just three or four nights. It can, however, be combined with Zanzibar, where much cheaper accommodation is available. Another destination in Southern Tanzania is Vuma Hill Tented Camp in the Mikumi National Park. This is just four hours by a good tarmac road from Dar es Salaam, and can again be combined with Zanzibar. Mikumi is a small gem of a park centred on a river plain, and has plenty of elephants, antelope, giraffe and lions. Vuma Hill is a luxury tented camp run by an Italian/French family and Franck, the manager, as you might expect, says: \"We welcome young kids, especially if they are cute\". However, they don't have special beds or baby chairs. Activities here are game drives, indulging in excellent Franco/Italian food and wine, and lazing around the swimming pool. Like Mbuyu, children under six are free - adults pay \u00a3100 per person per night - full board, sharing a tent. Vehicle hire from Dar es Salaam extra. Tony Janes, Simply Tanzania Tour Company Email: info@simplytanzania.co.uk \u00b7 As a tour operator in southern Africa, I\u00b9d like to reply to your reader asking whether it is possible or advisable to go on safari with a 3 1/2 year old child and why most organised tours exclude children under seven or 12. The first and most obvious thing is the age restriction. It is primarily for your child\u00b9s safety. Most game-viewing vehicles in lodges are open, to give maximum viewing ability; from the predator's point of view, the young of all species are an easy prey, so your child may be eyed speculatively, not to say appreciatively, by the big cats, who pick up on young excited voices. There are a number of other considerations, mostly based on the fact that your family will be joining a group of fellow tourists. Firstly, taking a child of that age is probably unwise as he/she is too young to appreciate all the sights, sounds and yes, dangers, that make up a good safari. Secondly, would you want to sit alongside someone else's young child with perhaps a low threshold of boredom while you wait silently and patiently for the animals you have paid good money to see? Thirdly, most lodges are dedicated to game-viewing; which means an early start at sunrise or before, followed by a four-hour game drive, then brunch, then an optional and usually longish game walk, followed by a siesta, then tea and snacks at 15:00 or so and then an afternoon/evening game drive for another four hours or so, with dinner about 20:00. This is often too much for adults, let alone a four-year old. However, there is a solution which we advocate and is the best of all worlds. Hire a car and drive yourselves through some of the many National Parks of southern Africa. In the majority of these parks/game reserves, you will drive on marked roads in a closed car, you will have the security of a mobile phone, and you can book excellent and inexpensive accommodation, going self-catering if you like, or enjoying a choice of good food from the restaurant. Your family will have a wonderful time on safari together, you will meet many other southern African families with young children and you will never feel miffed if one morning you do not feel like going out on a game drive. Finally, if you have few budget restraints and want a posh lodge, Botswana is probably the best place to view game in Africa and Kwando Safaris have recently won an accolade for teaching the young about safaris. Yours sincerely, John Haycock, Africa Explorer Email: africa.explorer@easynet.co.uk \u00b7 We visited the Wildlife Camp, South Luangwa, Zambia with another family. Between us we had four children aged five, four, three and two years. In general it was a great success. We stayed in bamboo chalets that overlooked the river and although self-catering was an option we all enjoyed the food in the bar/restaurant. We took two game drives with the youngest in her car seat tied into the Landrover. Most of the children fell asleep on the evening drive. Young children didn't seem to present a problem to the staff. They told the children how to behave when in the park and advised that no one walked unaccompanied after dark. I think that there were walking safaris that excluded children but it didn't matter as there was plenty of animals visible from the chalets and bar. The campsite was frequently visited by monkeys and at night the hippos came worryingly close to the chalets. We chose a \"value for money\" campsite and the larger hotel/lodges did seem to have more facilities - at a price. There were plenty to pick from. Already the children's memories are fading but the knowledge that they were happy and safe made all the difference to our trip. Contact: The Wildlife Camp, PO Box 510190, Chipata, Zambia.

There are no rules in the game parks that exclude children, but some local operators put limits on young children participating to avoid conflicts with other clients. And a very small number of wildlife lodges (notably the \"tree hotels\" like Treetops) have a \"no young children\" policy in a futile attempt to keep the atmosphere quiet at night (though decibel for decibel, the alcohol-imbibing adult crowd is usually more than a match for any kids allowed in). By all means take your child, but you'll have more flexibility if you take a beach holiday and get a safari locally, or just rent a Suzuki jeep and do your own thing. Tsavo National Park is only a couple of hours from the beach resorts and driving around the parks on your own is a truly memorable experience. Our most child-intense trip to Kenya was with boys aged five months and 3.5 years. Young children have a fantastic time on the coast, but take lots of toys to while away journeys and those boring periods while the adults are staring, enraptured, out of the window.
