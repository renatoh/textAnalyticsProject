It\u2019s been a big day for the Trump administration ending in a rally in Kentucky that is ongoing. Here\u2019s what has happened so far. Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Donald Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is now willing to help with the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. The Republican National Committee (RNC) reportedly spent $60,000 on tickets for Donald Trump and guests to sit ringside at an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at Madison Square Garden over the weekend. Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Apple on Monday for announcing a $2.5bn pledge to create affordable housing, calling it a distraction. The University of Alabama is making preparations for Donald Trump to attend its game with Louisiana State University on Saturday. Donald Trump used his Twitter account on Monday to plug his son\u2019s new book, drawing criticism as he faces ongoing controversy for criticizing former vice president Joe Biden for allowing his son to profit off his father\u2019s office. Donald Trump spoke at a rally in Kentucky on Monday in support of incumbent governor Matt Bevin. He berated the press, had journalists from the Washington Post removed from the rally, and alluded to spending another 15 years in office. Donald Trump is warning his followers that the Democrats \u201care coming for your guns\u201d and telling them to \u201cprotect the precious second amendment\u201d in his speech at a Kentucky rally. The president also re-asserted his false claim that California\u2019s mismanagement of the homelessness crisis has led to water pollution. He also addressed the \u201cderanged, hyper-partisan impeachment witch hunt\u201d led by Democrats. The president pointed to the press area at the rally and condemned the \u201cfake news\u201d media as the crowd booed. He ordered security to remove reporters from the Washington Post. Donald Trump just entered the building at a rally in Kentucky. He is speaking on the eve of an election in the state where voters will chose between incumbent Republican governor Matt Bevin and Democratic attorney general Andy Beshear. Donald Trump used his Twitter account on Monday to plug his son\u2019s new book, drawing criticism as he faces ongoing controversy for criticizing former vice president Joe Biden for allowing his son to profit off his father\u2019s office. He tweeted about the new book by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., telling his 66.5 million followers that they should \u201cGo order it today!\u201d According to the Associated Press, this kind of promotional tweet would be a violation of ethics rules if it had come from any federal employee other than the president, said Liz Hempowicz, the director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog group. \u201cFrankly he\u2019s using his Twitter account to try to financially benefit his son,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s not only distasteful, but it\u2019s a misuse of public office and it would be an official misuse of public office if it was anyone other than the president.\u201d The tweet also highlights a well-practiced tactic of Trump trying to turn a weakness into an attack on his opponents. The University of Alabama is making preparations for Donald Trump to attend its game with Louisiana State University on Saturday. The planned visit comes after Trump was booed at the fifth game of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros and again at an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at Madison Square Garden over the weekend. Former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville tweeted that Trump should attend the game for a warmer welcome than he has received at other sporting events recently. In 2016, Trump recieved 63% of the vote in Alabama, which is widely considered the most Republican state in the country. Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Apple on Monday for announcing a $2.5bn pledge to create affordable housing. The 2020 presidential candidate said the announcement is an effort to frame its entering the housing industry as altruism. \u201cApple\u2019s announcement that it is entering the real estate lending business is an effort to distract from the fact that it has helped create California\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 all while raking in $800 million of taxpayer subsidies, and keeping a quarter trillion dollars of profit offshore, in order to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. Apple said it will devote $1bn to affordable housing investment fund and $1bn to a mortgage assistance fund fund for first-time homebuyers. The company will also create a $150m fund to distribute long-term \u201cforgivable loans\u201d and grants to affordable housing projects. The commitment of $2.5 bn represents less than 4% of the $65 bnApple made in revenue in quarter four alone. The Republican National Committee (RNC) reportedly spent $60,000 on tickets for Donald Trump and guests to sit ringside at an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at Madison Square Garden over the weekend, the Washington Post reported. It is unclear how many tickets were purchased and at what price, as public ticket prices ranged from $100 to $700 each. One official told the Post the $60,000 total included catering and security. From the Post: Members of the House are allowed to take free tickets for sporting events if the event is a \u201cbona fide\u201d fundraiser, according to House ethics rules. The event was not an official fundraiser nor a campaign event, so it is unclear how the lawmakers could accept tickets. Members also have to receive written approval to take a gift. The official said the RNC paid because the president attended. Trump was pictured posing backstage at the event with a wrestling belt. Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has long been friends with the president. Previously the RNC paid $465 per seat for Trump and 11 officials to attend the fifth game of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros, which Trump left early after being booed. A lawyer for Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Donald Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, said the Ukranian-American business man is now willing to help with the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. After initially denying requests from the Congressional committee to impeach Donald Trump he is now prepared to comply with requests for records and testimony from congressional impeachment investigators. \u201cWe will honor and not avoid the committee\u2019s requests to the extent they are legally proper, while scrupulously protecting Mr Parnas\u2019 privileges including that of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d said the lawyer, Joseph Bondy, referring to his client\u2019s constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. His previous lawyer, John Dowd, wrote to the committees in early October complaining that their requests for documents were \u201coverly broad and unduly burdensome.\u201d Parnas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last month to being part of a scheme that used a shell company to donate money to a pro-Trump election committee and illegally raise money for a former congressman as part of an effort to have the president remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens was at the heart of a whistleblower complaint by an intelligence officer that sparked the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24. Hello readers, Kari Paul here taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for more news. It\u2019s been a roller coaster of a day for the Trump administration and the president\u2019s not done yet. As Trump heads to Kentucky, here\u2019s a recap of where the day stands. The House intelligence committee released the transcripts of two key witnesses in the escalating abuse-of-power scandal involving Trump\u2019s efforts to extract damaging information on his political rivals from Ukraine. The committee released the transcripts of former US Ambassador to UkraineMarie Yovanovitch and former senior adviser to the secretary of state, Ambassador Michael McKinley after four witnesses failed to appear on Capitol Hill for depositions. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump\u2019s accounting firm must hand over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors. Trump\u2019s lawyer has vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court. Writer and advice columnist E Jean Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump over allegations that the president raped her after a chance encounter in a department store more than twenty years ago. Trump has denied the allegation and his press secretary dismissed the suit as \u201cfrivolous\u201d. The Trump administration has initiated the year-long process of leaving the Paris climate agreement, a decision that isolates the US as the only country in the world not signed onto the pact. With a year to go, Democrats\u2019 prospects of winning back the White House in 2020 look bleak, according to new New York Times polling released one year out from the election. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed as \u201cfrivolous\u201da defamation lawsuit filed by E Jean Carroll, who has accused Trump of sexual assault. \u201cThe story is a fraud \u2013 just like the author,\u201d Grisham says. Chopper talk: Before Trump heads to Kentucky, he took a few shouted questions from reporters. Climate is literally on the ballot in 2020. The Trump administration on Monday officially began the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, isolating the US as the only country in the world not to participate in the pact. \u201cPresident Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because of the unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers by US pledges made under the Agreement,\u201d US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in a statement. \u201c The United States has reduced all types of emissions, even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens\u2019 access to affordable energy.\u201d According to the terms of the accords, the state department filed paperwork with the United Nations notifying the international body of it intent to leave the climate accords. The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification, which falls just one day after the 2020 presidential election. In the Paris agreement, the US agreed to cut its heat-trapping pollution at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the agreement in 2017 but could not start the process until three years after the pact went into effect. Joe Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield has cast doubt over the feasibility of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s payment plan for Medicare for all. \u201cAt a time when President Trump is attempting to take away health care coverage from millions of Americans by challenging Obamacare in the courts or undermining it through executive action, Vice President Joe Biden is taking him on, as he will anyone \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 who seeks to undo the most monumental reform to our health care system in a generation,\u201d Bedingfield said in a lengthy statement. Of Warren\u2019s Medicare for all plan, Bedingfield said it\u2019s \u201csimply not true\u201d that the proposal wouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone but billionaires. \u201cIt would create a new tax on employers of almost $9 trillion that would come out of the pockets and paychecks of middle class Americans and a new financial transaction tax that would impact investments that many middle class Americans are counting on,\u201d she said. \u201cTo make matters worse, the mathematical gymnastics that overcount the revenue that would be gained from the sources she identifies also lowball the cost of her plan by well over $10 trillion, which means a hidden burden awaits middle class families if this plan ever came to fruition.\u201d Warren has steadily gained ground on Biden, who has consistently led the field since he entered the race earlier this year. Last week the Massachusetts senator unveiled a $20.5tn plan to provide healthcare to every American without raising taxes on the middle class. The proposal came after she spent weeks sidestepping questions on the campaign trail and on the debate stage about how she would finance her Medicare for all plan. Warren\u2019s rivals accused her of not being honest with the American people, insisting that she would have to raise taxes on middle class families as Bernie Sanders has said he would. From the South Lawn, Trump honored the Washington Nationals on the \u201cfirst of many\u201d World Series championships. He called their victory a \u201ccomeback story for the ages.\u201d He heaped praise on Nats manager David Mart\u00ednez, who he said \u201cdidn\u2019t make any mistakes\u201d and might be \u201cmore famous than me\u201d. \u201cAmerica fell in love with the Nats baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all they wanted to talk about. That and impeachment. I like Nats baseball much more.\u201d A few members of the team did not attend, at least one in objection of the president\u2019s politics. But Trump also had some supporters on the team. Catcher Kurt Suzuki was brought to the mic by Trump sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. Trump urged the team to get back to celebrating after their White House appearance because: \u201cAs soon as you lose the first two or three games you\u2019re not going to be heros anymore. That\u2019s how it goes.\u201d The sweet sounds of Baby Shark are serenading guests on the South Lawn as the crowd awaits Trump to honor the Washington Nationals, who won the 2019 World Series champions. Most \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the players opted to go to the White House. Kamala Harris has qualified for the Democratic debate in December in Los Angeles over the weekend. She will join frontrunner Joe Biden as well as Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. The support and polling threshold to qualify for the December debate is higher than the one in Atlanta this month, which will feature 9 candidates on stage. Donald Trump has a lot on his plate: an escalating abuse-of-power scandal, looming impeachment, a possible resurgence of Isis, an emboldened Iran, etc. But he\u2019s got a forthcoming book on his mind, and it\u2019s not the one he\u2019s hawking on behalf of his son. It\u2019s A Warning, the book by an anonymous Trump official who wrote a 2018 New York Times op-ed in which he expressed alarm about the president\u2019s competence. CNN reported that Trump\u2019s department of justice has sent a letter to the book\u2019s publisher warning that the author could be in violation of a nondisclosure agreement. \u201cIf the author is, in fact, a current or former \u2018senior official\u2019 in the Trump Administration, publication of the book may violate that official\u2019s legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements, including nondisclosure agreements that are routinely required with respect to information obtained in the course of one\u2019s official responsibilities or as a condition for access to classified information,\u201d assistant attorney general Joseph Hunt wrote in the letter, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN. The author\u2019s literary agency has rejected the justice department\u2019s argument, and said the book would be released on 19 November as scheduled. \u201cOur author knows that the President is determined to unmask whistleblowers who may be in his midst. That\u2019s one of the reasons A WARNING was written,\u201d the literary agency, Javelin, said in a statement. \u201cBut we support the publisher in its resolve that the administration\u2019s effort to intimidate and expose the senior official who has seen misconduct at the highest levels will not prevent this book from moving forward.\u201d Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence committee who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said he expects the witnesses this afternoon to not show for their deposition, which he said the lawmakers will interpret as further obstruction of justice by the White House. \u201cThese witnesses are significant and the White House understands they\u2019re significant,\u201d Schiff said during a press conference after releasing the transcripts. He added: \u201cWe may infer that their testimony would be further incriminating the president.\u201d Schiff said the committees will release the transcripts of Kurt Volker, the president\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the European Union, on Tuesday. Our world affairs editor Julian Borger is combing through the transcripts, tweeting his observations as they come. The committees investigating impeachment against Donald Trump over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to extract damaging information on his political rivals has entered a \u201cnew public phase\u201d with the release of transcripts for two key witnesses. The deposition transcript with former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch from 11 October 2019 can be read here. The deposition transcript of former senior adviser to the secretary of state, Ambassador Michael McKinley, from 16 October 2019 can be read here. \u201cThe transcripts of interviews with Ambassadors Yovanovitch and McKinley demonstrate clearly how President Trump approved the removal of a highly respected and effective diplomat based on public falsehoods and smears against Ambassador Yovanovitch\u2019s character and her work in support of long-held US foreign policy anticorruption goals,\u201d said the chairs of the three panels leading the investigations. \u201cAmbassadors Yovanovitch and McKinley\u2019s testimony also demonstrates the contamination of US foreign policy by an irregular back channel that sought to advance the President\u2019s personal and political interests, and the serious concerns that this activity elicited across our government.\u201d What\u2019s the matter with Kansas, you ask? That\u2019s the question our world affairs editor Julian Borger, asked in a recent report cataloging the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo\u2019s, many overtures to his adopted home state, where speculation \u2013 and evidence \u2013 is mounting that he\u2019s plotting a Senate run. The outreach includes pins stamped with the word \u201cswagger\u201d, an appearance with the president\u2019s daughter and dozens of interviews with local press, some of which have turned quite testy. To many \u2013 in Kansas and beyond \u2013 that looked like a stretch. The badges, glad-handing and posing with Ms Trump seemed more like someone lining up his next job, particularly as it coincides with one of the state\u2019s Republican senators stepping down. It was Pompeo\u2019s fourth visit to the midwestern state so far this year, and more than one in seven of the nearly 200 interviews he has given in 2019 have been to Kansas-based media outlets. It was also reported by the Wall Street Journal, that he took time in Wichita to meet Charles Koch, his longstanding sponsor and a kingmaker on the right of Republican party. Three of Pompeo\u2019s trips to Kansas have been official visits paid for by the state department, leading Democrats to file a complaint that he is violating federal laws prohibiting political activities while acting in an official capacity. Pompeo dismissed the complaint as \u201csilliness\u201d. Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow has vowed to take the case dealing with the president\u2019s tax returns to the supreme court. Writer E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump on Monday, accusing the president of defamation after she came forward this summer to allege that he raped her more than two decades ago in the dressing room of an upscale New York City department store. Carroll, a longtime advice columnist, described the alleged assault in her book What Do We Need Men For?, an excerpt of which was published in New York magazine in June. According to her account, which Trump has adamantly denied, Carroll said she ran into Trump, whom she had met a few years previously, at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996. After chatting about lingerie, they shopped together before he attacked her in a dressing room. She said Trump pulled down her tights and penetrated her before she was able to push him off of her and leave. Carroll does not describe the incident as \u201crape\u201d though her description of the incident meets the legal definition. A US appeals court ruled on Monday that Donald Trump\u2019s accounting firm must turn over eight years of the president\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns to New York prosecutors. The ruling is the latest setback for the president, who has fought vigorously to block his accounting firm, Mazars USA, from releasing his tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Trump is expected to appeal the ruling, a move that is likely to send the case to the US supreme court. \u201cBecause we conclude that the president is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his immunity claim, we agree with the district court that he is not entitled to injunctive relief,\u201d the ruling states. As expected, two witnesses subpoenaed to testify before the House intelligence committee on Capitol Hill today have refused to appear, according to CNN. The other two witnesses called to testify this afternoon are also expected not to appear today. Meanwhile, Fiona Hill, the top Russia expert in the White House who testified last month is back on the Hill today, presumably to check review a transcript of her testimony before Democrats release it publicly. Donald Trump is distancing himself from \u201c a man named Michael Esposito.\u201d Who, you might be asking, is Michael Esposito? According to the Washington Post, Esposito is a lobbyist whose dubious ties to the president has turned his family business into an international success. But Trump\u2019s son and son-in-law say they have never heard of Esposito. Esposito has \u201can open line of communication to the President of the United States\u201d and is in \u201cregular\u201d contact with the president, Federal Advocates wrote in three contract bids reviewed by The Washington Post. The same proposals say Esposito worked with the president\u2019s son Eric Trump and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner on real estate deals. And the firm\u2019s website calls Esposito \u201can integral part of the senior-most leadership\u201d of the Republican National Committee. Some of those very people, however, told The Post that Esposito\u2019s claims are greatly embellished \u2014 or simply not true. \u201cI have no recollection of a Michael Esposito,\u201d said Eric Trump. \u201cSounds like someone trying to trade off our name.\u201d \u201cJared Kushner does not know who Michael Esposito is,\u201d an administration official said. The RNC recently sent him a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter. The story was published online 1 November but published on the front page of today\u2019s Washington Post. The tweet furthers speculation that, as suspected, Trump has not stopped reading the paper despite demanding that all White House agencies cancel their subscriptions to the Post and the New York Times. As we mentioned earlier, the 2020 election is less than a year away. But the Democratic primary remains unsettled and polling suggests a very tight race no matter the nominee. Which raises the question: Is it time for a Clinton revival? The idea of Hillary Clinton returning as the Democratic White Knight in 2020 to slay the dragon in the White House has evoked some still-raw emotions from supporters, detractors and everyone in between. Yet the 2016 Democratic nominee seems to be having more fun than she ever had as a candidate fanning the flames of another run. My colleague David Smith looks at how Clinton might be positioning herself for an improbable run for the White House. Speaking in New York at a screening of The Great Hack about the Cambridge Analytica scandal this weekend, Clinton said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u201cshould pay a price\u201d for what he is doing to democracy. The 2016 Democratic nominee expressed doubts about whether free and fair elections were even possible in the wake of Facebook\u2019s decision to not factcheck political advertising. Can there be any sentence more likely to turn off blog readers than \u201can alarming poll from the New York Times\u201d? Possibly not, but here goes\u2026 A year out from election day 2020, Nate Cohn of the New York Times has published the results of new polls in key swing states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. And if you are not a supporter of Donald Trump, and in particular if you are a supporter of Senator Elizabeth Warren, the picture does not look particularly rosy. Here\u2019s a screengrab: Of course, the picture is a little brighter if you back Joe Biden \u2013 the moderate\u2019s moderate, the Centrist Dad\u2019s Centrist Dad \u2013 or Bernie Sanders, the great progressive hope of 2016 who is trailing Warren in Democratic polls this year. Here\u2019s how Cohn sums it up: Across the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, [Trump] trails Joe Biden by an average of two points among registered voters but stays within the margin of error. Mr Trump leads Elizabeth Warren by two points among registered voters, the same margin as his win over Hillary Clinton in these states three years ago. The poll showed Bernie Sanders deadlocked with the president among registered voters, but trailing among likely voters. The results suggest that Ms Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, might face a number of obstacles in her pursuit of the presidency. The poll supports concerns among some Democrats that her ideology and gender \u2013 including the fraught question of \u2018likability\u2019 \u2014 could hobble her candidacy among a crucial sliver of the electorate. And not only does she underperform her rivals, but the poll also suggests that the race could be close enough for the difference to be decisive. Hmmm. Polling out at the weekend from The Washington Post and ABC News put Biden in the lead nationally among Democratic primary voters, from Warren, Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. The mayor of South Bend is second in Iowa, though, and has said he thinks the nomination fight is now between him and Warren. On the subject of Mayor Pete and Iowa, Cohn of the Times says the following: Ms Warren trailed Mr Trump by six points in Iowa, the widest gap among leading Democrats, even though she led the Democratic caucus in our poll. Pete Buttigieg, who is generally not as well known as Ms Warren, trailed Mr Trump by four points in Iowa, which was the only state where we included him in head-to-head polling against the president. Mr Biden trailed by one point and Mr Sanders by three. Sobering news also from Texas, meanwhile, home state of Beto O\u2019Rourke who withdrew from the Democratic race on Friday and a dream target for Democrats, if not necessarily a realistic one. Ross Ramsey of the Texas Tribune writes that according to a poll conducted by the paper and the University of Texas: None of the top Democrats seeking the presidential nomination would beat President Donald Trump in Texas in an election held today\u2026 Joe Biden of Delaware, the former vice-president, is running 7% behind Trump in Texas, as is Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Bernie Sanders of Vermont falls 5 % short in a head-to-head with the president among Texas voters.\u201d Further hmmm. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of politics from the nation\u2019s capital. We are now officially less than one year away from election day 2020 and less than 100 days until the Iowa caucuses. Let that sink in. The House is on recess this week but the committees investigating impeachment remain in Washington to move forward with the inquiry over Donald Trump\u2019s handling of military aid to Ukraine. There are four witnesses \u2013 all political appointees \u2013 scheduled for depositions today, but it remains unclear if they\u2019ll show up in defiance of White House orders not to cooperate in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The witnesses include Robert Blair, an assistant to the president and senior adviser to Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Brian McCormack, the associate director for natural resources at the Office of Management and Budget; and White House attorneys John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis. Trump has a busy day. At 11.45am he meets with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in the Oval Office. Later in the afternoon, he hosts the 2019 World Series Champions, the Washington Nationals, on the South Lawn. Then the president departs for Lexington, Kentucky, where he will speak at a campaign rally ahead of the state\u2019s gubernatorial elections on Tuesday. Trump has also already started to tweet, and judging the time between when he stopped sending missives last night until he started up again this morning \u2013 the president isn\u2019t operating on much sleep. This morning Trump began by reviving the intrigue around an executive tweet early in his presidency that was the subject of much discussion among Washington insiders: \u201ccovfefe\u201d. Here Trump playfully suggests the tweet \u201cmay be something with deep meaning\u201d. Returning to a more familiar subject, Trump fired off a blitz of tweets railing against the Ukraine scandal and the anonymous whistleblower who touched off the investigation. Though multiple witnesses have confirmed key elements of the whistleblower complaint regarding a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 and not to mention that it also matches the rough transcript of the call released by the White House \u2013 Trump has stepped up his attacks on the whistleblower, demanding the identity be revealed. He also again slapped down an offer by the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers to answers written questions from Republican members of Congress, an effort to show the person\u2019s willingness to cooperate. And he couldn\u2019t help but to brag about his standing within the Republican party, which was on display last week as the GOP kept a united front against a resolution formally launching the investigation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
