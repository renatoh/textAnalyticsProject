The Philippine government of president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is engaged in what it hopes will be a fight to the death of a Muslim separatist group, Abu Sayaff. The separatists have also raised the wrath of the Bush administration, which has supplied about 1,000 military personnel to train counter-insurgency troops and sophisticated spy technology to hound out the guerrillas. America claims that the violent guerrilla movement is linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida group. What is Abu Sayaff? Abu Sayyaf is a small Islamist group fighting to establish an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines. Abu Sayyaf means \"Bearer of the Sword\". The group was formed in 1991 to sprearhead armed resistance to the Philippine government. It was implacably opposed to peace initiatives between the government and the leading Muslim group in the country, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Who created the movement? Abu Sayaff was formed by Abduragak Abubakar Janjalani, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. The firebrand leader is reported to have kept close ties with other Islamist radical leaders he met during the fight against Russian occupation. In December 1998, Janjalani was killed in a battle with the security services on Basilam Island in the southern Philippines. A power struggle within the organisation ensued until the former leader's brother, Khadafy Janjalani emerged as the new leader. He is on a list of Islamists wanted by the US government. Security sources believe he is one of the individuals fleeing through the forest of Jolo island, where the current fight is taking place. Another guerrilla leader, Isnilon Hapilon, who is also on the US wanted list, is thought to be with him. The group's chief spokesman and leader of a recent spate of kidnappings was reported to have been killed last Friday as he tried to escape the island by boat. How many members are left? The latest estimate by the Philippine military suggests that there are as few as 250 Abu Sayaff guerrillas left alive. That compares with about 1,000 just one year ago. The army is determined to catch or kill all of the remaining rebels. Why are they wanted? Abu Sayaff has financed its operations in part by kidnapping foreigners and demanding hefty ransoms. Tourists have been snatched from island resorts in the Philippines and Malaysia and taken to Jolo. The latest kidnapping spree involved 102 hostages, including an American missionary couple. Journalists who have been invited to interview the captives have themselves been held hostage. The guerrillas have a reputation for beheading captives. They have also mounted bomb attacks on airports and Roman Catholic Churches. America has targeted the group in its first salvo in the \"war on terrorism\" to be conducted outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. What are Muslim separatists doing in the Philippines? Islam was introduced to southeast Asia by travelling merchants several centuries ago. About 5% of the predominantly Catholic Filipino population is Muslim. Most Muslims live on a string of islands in the south of the archipelago nation. Their inclusion in the modern-day Philippines is in part a colonial legacy left behind by the United States, which claimed sovereignty over the islands until 1946. On independence, Muslim parts of the archipelago were deemed part of the independent Philippine Republic. Muslim leaders had long hoped to form an independent state comprising the southern islands, which lie close to Muslim Malaysia and Indonesia. The fledgling Catholic state sponsored the migration of Christians to the south. By the 1960s armed militiamen were reported to have committed massacres of resident Muslims. By the early 1970s young Muslim men were themselves being trained in guerilla warfare in Malaysia. Martial law imposed by the authoritarian president Ferdinand Marcos prompted armed rebellion. War in the southern Philippines killed thousands of soldiers and civilians and displaced several thousand more refugees. The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) emerged as the leading Muslim opposition force. It won open support from Iran and Libya. After the fall of the Marcos regime in 1985, the MNLF embraced popular politics and engaged in peace initiatives with the government. Abu Sayaff emerged as a splinter group opposed to peace initiatives between Muslims and the state. What are the Americans doing? America has put a bounty of $5m (\u00a33.3m) on the heads of the Abu Sayaff leadership. It has also sent 1,000 servicemen, including marines, pilots, and engineers, to train and support 5,000 Filipino troops posted in the southern islands. It has put surveillance and satellite technology at the disposal of the Philippine government. Last week, US soldiers engaged guerrilla fire for the first time. They also helped plan a botched rescue attempt of three hostages on June 7, when an American missionary and a Filipino nurse were killed. The Bush administration is considering extending their six-month mission beyond July."}, "isHosted": false}}}
