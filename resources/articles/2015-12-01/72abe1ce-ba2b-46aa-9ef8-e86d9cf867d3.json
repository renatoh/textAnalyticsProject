There had been surprise over the summer at the France international\u2019s willingness to swap Paris Saint-Germain for Crystal Palace but, more than four months back into the hurly-burly of the Premier League, he would argue he has already justified that risky decision. Not in terms of matching the six-trophy haul he managed in 18 months back in France. Or even the likelihood of competing in the Champions League again any time soon. In terms of first-team involvement as an integral member of a progressive, ambitious team and with one eye on next summer\u2019s European Championship, however, it is paying off. Cabaye managed only 967 minutes as a fringe performer with PSG in Ligue 1 last season. He has already enjoyed 1,357 for Palace in the top flight. That time has been littered with as many interceptions and busy tackles as classy passes and telling attacking contributions. His presence has affected other mainstays of this side, from Mile Jedinak\u2019s lack of chances to the slight tweaks required in Jason Puncheon\u2019s game, but the sheer quality offered by the Frenchman compensates. On Saturday he started and finished the move that provided the contest\u2019s only goal, running unchecked on to Yannick Bolasie\u2019s cut-back to puncture Southampton with his fifth of term. Yet it was just as easy to linger on the raking pass that liberated Connor Wickham for a shot late on or the audacious crunched attempt from a narrow angle after his own corner had arrived back at his feet near the touchline. Paulo Gazzaniga did well to fingertip that effort away. Cabaye has offered this team a different dimension. \u201cHe delivers in training, he delivers on match day, he delivers when you\u2019re up against it,\u201d said Pardew of Palace\u2019s record signing. \u201cHe can pull you out of the mire. That\u2019s what great players do \u2013 and that\u2019s what gets you into the French national side. If Didier Deschamps wants to know how Yohan is performing, he\u2019d need only see a recording of that game. He was terrific. He\u2019s settled in easily, the other players respect him and understand him, and he\u2019s a special talent. I\u2019m fortunate to have him here but we as a club have earned that right to bring in good players like Yohan Cabaye. We need to go and find ourselves another one, maybe two, and then we\u2019d be a really good team.\u201d A midfielder whose bit-part role at Parc des Princes had reduced him to the fringes of Deschamps\u2019 squad last season can now contemplate a summer back in his homeland, fitness permitting, having re-established his credentials with the national side, although he is not the only member of the Palace lineup daring to dream of Europe. This victory maintained their upward trajectory over a startling calendar year: Palace have 57 points from their 34 league games in 2015. To put that in context, Tottenham Hotspur finished fifth with 64 last term. Southampton were not far behind last season \u2013 they ended in seventh, four points behind Spurs \u2013 but after another bright start they have endured what the centre-half Jos\u00e9 Fonte deemed \u201ca sticky patch\u201d of late. This was a fourth defeat in five, confirmed when the excellent Wayne Hennessey blocked a shot from Shane Long in stoppage time at the end. Spurs, managed by Mauricio Pochettino, with his own links to St Mary\u2019s, visit the south coast on Saturday, with Arsenal to follow on Boxing Day. \u201cBut those are the games that could bring out the best in us because the desire and fighting spirit are there,\u201d Fonte said. \u201cWe have shown we can compete against anyone and we are not scared of anyone.\u201d Man of the match Yohan Cabaye (Crystal Palace)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
