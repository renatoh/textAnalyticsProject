Scotland\u2019s hopes of making the last 16 of the World Cup disappeared when Argentina retook and scored an injury-time penalty that had been saved by Lee Alexander after the goalkeeper was seen to have moved off her line too soon. It followed similar VAR-driven retakes by France and Italy against Nigeria and Jamaica respectively, both of which were also converted at the second attempt. \u201cFor something so new to be introduced on such a big stage, it\u2019s hard to get your head around it in terms of changing habits,\u201d said Bardsley. The Manchester City player, speaking after England\u2019s 2-0 win over Japan, added: \u201cWe were briefed by the referees and they did mention that if we do move off the line. But if it\u2019s a toenail \u2026 Fingers crossed, fortunately nothing has really happened to us, but it just seems cruel. And so pedantic.\u201d Bardsley said she did not pay attention to the precise position of her feet when facing a penalty. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are thinking about it in the moment. We\u2019ve always been able to move laterally but it\u2019s strange to crack down on it.\u201d The Premier League will not use VAR to judge goalkeepers\u2019 movements at penalties next season, leaving those decisions to on-field officials, although it will review its approach during the campaign. Bardsley, appearing at her third World Cup, has been hugely impressed with the quality on display from her fellow goalkeepers. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone has been bagging on us for so long that we\u2019re just like: \u2018We will show you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt just goes to show how much the women\u2019s game has improved over the years. Outstanding goalkeepers, fantastic reaction saves. The Argentina keeper was absolutely outstanding [against England] \u2013 you\u2019ve got to give credit where it\u2019s due. She made phenomenal saves.\u201d Bardsley says she cannot judge whether an improvement in the quality of goalkeeper coaching has led to an overall rise in standards, but believes she has benefited in that regard at City. \u201cMy coach certainly helped my game evolve from a relatively old-school style to a more modern style of goalkeeping,\u201d she said. Pressed on what old school means, she said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re constantly jumping over cones or it looks like they can land aeroplanes where you\u2019re training, or jumping over hurdles. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for it, don\u2019t get me wrong, but you\u2019re really starting to incorporate different techniques from handball and futsal. It\u2019s about timing more than anything else. Those little intricacies are slowly being picked up in the women\u2019s game and it\u2019s going unnoticed.\u201d If the introduction of a goalkeeper accolade at the Fifa Best awards has buoyed performances, that does not apply to Bardsley, who had not noticed its existence. \u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a popularity contest at the end of the day. That\u2019s what it seems like. I\u2019m not fussed about awards, I just want to win a medal and a trophy.\u201d Bardsley was back in the team, having started against Scotland in England\u2019s Group D opener, as one of eight changes to the side that played against Argentina. Two others to come in, Rachel Daly and Georgia Stanway, impressed on their World Cup debuts. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind,\u201d said Daly, who is at her first World Cup at the age of 27, having been told at youth level she would never be good enough for England. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually realise what it feels like till you get out there on the pitch. Off the pitch things are still wild \u2013 you\u2019ve seen the fanzones \u2013 but once you cross that white line it really kicks in that you\u2019re at a World Cup.\u201d Daly, having been used as backup to Lucy Bronze at right-back, was given a chance in a preferred forward position alongside the goalscorer Ellen White. \u201cI\u2019m naturally a more attacking player so it\u2019s good for me to be up there,\u201d she said. \u201cPhil [Neville, the manager] gives me the freedom to express myself; he doesn\u2019t criticise forwards for taking chances.\u201d Daly uses anger to fire herself up: \u201cI play better when I\u2019m angry. I wind myself up.\u201d Stanway, who plays as a forward for Manchester City, was used in midfield, where Neville had experimented with her pre-tournament. She provided an assist and, like Daly, is happy to be contributing to a selection headache for Neville in the knockout phase. \u201cPretty much everybody has had the chance to get on the pitch,\u201d Stanway said. \u201cThere\u2019s a few that have not made that yet, but I\u2019m almost certain that they\u2019ll get their opportunity at some point. \u201cYou can see that whenever someone scores the whole bench are up and everybody is trying to celebrate together because we\u2019re one. Whether you\u2019re playing, whether you\u2019re not, everyone is just supporting each other.\u201d The Lionesses are the first England team to win all their group games since 1982 and Stanway thinks that has sent out a message. \u201cWe\u2019d hope that they fear us. We\u2019d hope that nobody wants to play England. We\u2019re just excited to showcase what we can do. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the confidence to do it. We\u2019ve got the freedom to do it. We\u2019re just going to go out there and showcase our creativity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
