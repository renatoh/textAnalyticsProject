However, a new book from the Institute for Public Policy Research - entitled The Citizen's Stake - is calling for employers and employees to take a \"whole career approach\" to their working lives and dramatically rethink the way they think about time. The Citizen's Stake approach involves viewing your working life as a number of \"time units\" that can be saved, borrowed and exchanged - much as our financial assets can. In this way, our working lives could be dramatically reshaped so that work-life balance becomes more of a reality. For example, annual leave could accumulate over a period of years to enable employees to take long, paid sabbaticals from work at a time of their choosing. Such an idea is a natural extension to asset-based welfare that started with the introduction of Child Trust Funds, establishing the basic principles of a \"citizen's inheritance\", where all citizens are given assets by the state. In its purest form, this might eventually lead to each citizen getting a universal and uniform basic income from the state. In reality, it means a variety of smaller schemes that help people throughout their lives, from a pot of money at the age of 18 to an entitlement to opt out of working life for a certain amount of time. This means moving away from planning leave around such things as a shopping day before Christmas, and towards time off in terms of when you might like a career break - perhaps in 20 or 30 years, with considered banking of time across working life. Although this would be a huge cultural shift for employers, it does not have huge financial implications. \"There is no cost to the employer of setting this up,\" says Jim McCormick, director of the Scottish Council Foundation, an independent thinktank based in Edinburgh and author of the chapter on time. In fact it is not without precedent, with similar, although less ambitious, plans being piloted in both Australia and Canada, such as Australia's Department of Education and Science where employees can purchase up to eight weeks' additional leave and have their reduced salary spread across the year, with their salary for superannuation purposes counted at the full amount, as if they had not purchased leave. While it is easy for employers to agree to such ideas in principle, however, it is much harder to put it into practice. Whether employers do so is determined by the size and characteristics of the workforce. Flexible practices tend to be more common where the workforce consists mainly of women with low earnings and younger children; they are least likely in small workforces or where there is a large proportion of high earning males who are part of a two-income household. But even where such benefits are offered, take-up is frequently low, despite the popularity of working from home and ever improving technological advances. For many, this is because they feel taking advantage of them would affect their prospects and lead to \"career death\". A culture of long hours and the need to be seen in the office brings with it \"Presenteeism\". Take Mike Howard, 32, a consultant: \"I would love to take advantage of the flexible working my firm offers so that I could share childcare and work from home half of the week. But it's obvious that if I do this I will be effectively ruling myself out of promotion.\" However, such schemes offer many benefits for both employers and employees. The added work-life balance should help to prevent unmanageable stress and burnout, benefiting the employer by giving staff a higher level of \"workability\" - the ability and capacity of employees to continue as productive workers. The time off could be used for leisure, perhaps to travel or to spend time with one's family, or as a chance for participants to undertake research, learning or personal development. Nor does such time need to be used to achieve something specific - time off could be used just to \"recharge the batteries\", with likely consequences of reducing burn-out and helping retention in the later stages of a career. It is arguable that such a period of time off might improve productivity if people came back refreshed and ready to develop new skills. On the other hand, critics point out that the scheme could have the opposite effect and remind employees that they do not necessarily enjoy working life. There is a danger that such time could be accumulated not for the benefit of the individual, but to allow them to undertake essential parenting or caring roles, a burden which largely falls on women. \"The only way to make sure employees don't build up their assets for these purposes is to have more generous statutory entitlements,\" argues McCormick. Details are also sketchy as to what happens if a person changes job, and whether such accumulated assets would be transferable. But once employers have worked out a way of making such a scheme available, those who remain inflexible are going to find it extremely hard to find, and retain, a suitable workforce. Time of your life How asset-based welfare might work Born at 00.01 on September 1 2002, Jessica was the first person in the UK to benefit from a Child Trust Fund. With government contributions at birth, the age of seven and again during secondary school, plus small weekly contributions from her parents, Jessica had several thousand pounds that became hers on her 18th birthday in 2020. After a session with an asset adviser, Jessica decided to use this money to fund her higher education, which she delayed for a year so she could take part in a local volunteering scheme, for which she was paid a small wage by the government. Immediately after university, Jessica joined a graduate training scheme. She had 25 days' leave a year but decided to use only 20, the minimum allowed by the Working Time Directive. She also bought an additional five days a year, reducing her annual salary, although this was spread out over the course of the year so she barely noticed. When Jessica turned 30, she decided she needed some \"me time\", hanging out on the beaches of south-east Asia. She has 80 days in her time bank and added them to her annual entitlement to take a three-month break. Some time later, when Jessica and her partner had children, a generous parental leave scheme allowed both to spend a significant part of the year at home with their child. During this time, a relative fell ill and Jessica became the primary carer. By this time, care accounts had been introduced for primary care workers, so Jessica was able to claim a capital grant to help her through this period. She later returned to work and was able to save and buy more units of time. When both children had left home, Jessica and her partner decided to use some of their accumulated time to travel around the world. They used the rest of it in smaller chunks during their early 60s, testing out plans and activities for their retirement aged 67."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
