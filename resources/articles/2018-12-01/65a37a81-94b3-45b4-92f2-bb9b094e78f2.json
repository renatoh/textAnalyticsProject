Ricardo Salles told the Guardian he will appeal and said the new government will \u201cdedicate a lot of attention\u201d to rising deforestation. A judge in S\u00e3o Paulo found Salles had committed \u201cadministrative improbity\u201d, suspended his political rights for three years, and ordered him to pay a fine worth ten times his monthly salary. Judge Fausto Seabra also found against the S\u00e3o Paulo state federation of industry, known as FIESP, and ordered it to pay the same fine. The civil action concerned an environmental management plan for a protected area around the River Tiet\u00ea in S\u00e3o Paulo state. Prosecutors alleged that Salles, two others and FIESP \u201ccommitted fraud in order to benefit business sectors, in particular mining companies and others associated with FIESP\u201d, arguing they modified maps and altered the environmental plan decree. The judge found that Salles violated legal and regulatory norms, impeded the participation of other sectors of the environmental system and \u201cattended the economic interests of a restricted group in detriment to the defence of the environment\u201d. He also said there was no \u201ceffective loss\u201d to the environment because the process was not approved. \u201cThe decision highlights there was no environmental damage, that there was no undue advantage on my part, there was nothing serious,\u201d said Salles. \u201cThe judge believed it was not up to the environment secretary to make changes to conciliate the environment with economic development.\u201d Gustavo Bebbiano, a member of Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet, said Salles could still assume his ministerial role despite the ruling. \u201cThere will be no space for anyone who does not have a clean sheet. I don\u2019t think that would be the case of future minister Ricardo Salles, but this will be considered in good time,\u201d he told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. Bolsonaro has attacked environment ministry agencies for excessive fines, advocated mining and commercial agriculture on protected indigenous reserves and said environmental protection cannot hold up economic development. Salles, whose appointment was recommended by an agribusiness association, has called global warming a \u201csecondary\u201d issue. Salles said the new government planned to make Brazil\u2019s environmental licensing and fines system transparent by putting it online, arguing that this would reduce the \u201clarge volume\u201d of fines revised or annulled by the courts. \u201cIf they were made with more technical rigour we would not have so many problems,\u201d he said. He said the new environmental ministry team will \u201crespect the law and respect people\u201d. \u201cBrazil always respected and cared a lot for the environment and we intend to continue,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
