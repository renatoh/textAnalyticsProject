It was typical of Ibrahimovic that he had no sooner arrived at Ajax than he was collecting a five-match ban for elbowing an opponent. There have been dust-ups on the training ground, too, and the coach Ronald Koeman has been prepared to drop the Swede after failing to get him to accept all the duties expected of an Ajax striker. The friction exists, however, only because Ibrahimovic has such a combination of strength and trickery that people used to make unjustified comparisons with Marco van Basten. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was keen to sign him in 2000 and presented the striker with a No9 Arsenal jersey he is reputed to have given away. Ibrahimovic's maverick streak has been renowned ever since he got into trouble by masquerading as a plainclothes policeman to alarm a kerb-crawler in Malmo's red-light district. He recently caused havoc in an airport by jokingly asking whether the security man had found his gun. Ajax, despite their famed thrift, splashed out \u00a35.7m to buy him in 2001. That has sometimes looked like a reckless investment but Ibrahimovic is still disconcertingly young and the club could yet get a return on an acquisition who turned 22 only last autumn. His opportunities tempt him to lapse into the life of a dilettante and he might have drifted off to Roma but he has stayed and now there are stirrings of dependability. Ibrahimovic has 21 goals from 27 games this season and, in view of the limitations of his country's other strikers, that should inspire trust in him. Ludovic Giuly France: age 27, caps 5, goal 1 It is best not to play in France if you want to play for France. The side who defend their title at Euro 2004 this summer will depend, as usual, on those who earn their living abroad. It is the form of men such as Zinedine Zidane (Real Madrid), Thierry Henry (Arsenal) and David Trezeguet (Juventus) that will be critical, yet Jacques Santini has tried to be open-minded about his squad. Santini came straight from a post at Lyon and therefore had club football at the forefront of his mind. Those such as Giuly stand a better chance of achieving prominence. The midfielder's career began at Lyon but his appeal to Santini scarcely depends on that. In his early days Giuly was noted for frantic running that got his team nowhere but he has become noticeably more judicious while benefiting from the stability Didier Deschamps has established at Monaco. Despite favouring the right flank he recorded two goals in the Champions League group stage and is also among the leading scorers in the league, where he has been the best player over the first half of the season. His international debut came as long ago as 2000 but Santini's interest in him is growing. He was not in the line-up at the start of the 2003 Confederations Cup but he was in action for the whole of the final. The toughness and energy of this little man equip him to challenge for the position beside Zidane. Maris Verpakovskis Latvia: age 24, caps 28, goals 10 There are Premiership clubs who had Maris Verpakovskis in mind, if only because Gary Johnson has made it his business to tell them about the forward. Yeovil Town's manager knows him from when he was in charge of the Latvian national side and the striker was in the Under-21s. Now, however, it is not just the obscurantists who talk about Verpakovskis. Three key goals in consecutive internationals drove Latvia to their place at Euro 2004. He scored to beat Sweden in Stockholm, found the net to defeat Turkey in the first leg of the play-off and then hit the equaliser in Istanbul as his team drew 2-2. No other attacker in Europe had quite that impact in 2003. Wolves dropped their interest and Verpakovskis has now agreed a five-year deal with Dynamo Kiev. \"It is the Premiership's loss,\" said Johnson. \"He will go on to show how very good he is. He reminds me of Marian Pahars and it's the injuries that Pahars has had that have given him his chance. \"He's quick, he's clever, he's two-footed and he's a great finisher. I was technical director of Latvia as well as coach and one of the things we wanted to do was change the mentality. There was too much caution and the teams all had sweepers. We asked them to at least try and play to their full potential, even if it meant that that they got beaten. \"I think that has been to the advantage of people like Maris, who have got flair. The players who have gone abroad are mentally stronger and Maris has developed. You saw the effect when Latvia came back from 2-0 down in Turkey.\" Deco Portugal: age 26, caps 4, goal 1 The Brazilian-born playmaker made an impact on the Portugal squad before he was given his international debut. Luis Figo complained that dishing out passports in this manner would \"kill the talent of young Portuguese players\". There may have been an underlying resentment, however, over the possibility that Deco, coming into his prime, will supersede the ageing members of Portugal's golden generation. Rui Costa of Milan could easily be replaced by him. Luiz Felipe Scolari, coach of Brazil's 2002 World Cup winners, now guides Portugal and will not be deterred from using the Porto player. \"Anyone who does not want to play with Deco need not turn up,\" he has said. The player's detractors scowled when he came on to make his international debut as a substitute in March and scored the winner against Brazil with a free-kick. Despite appearances that day success has not come easily to Deco. As a 15-year-old he failed to get a contract with a major club in Sao Paulo, then crossed the Atlantic to join Benfica before drifting down to Salgueiros. The upsurge began only when Porto signed him for a small fee. Deco is now the inspiration of the club who beat Celtic in the Uefa Cup final. Jose Mourinho's side entered the midwinter break unbeaten in the league and are looking forward to their encounter with Manchester United in the Champions League. Deco's dead-ball delicacy, through-passing and confidence in beating would-be markers make him influential. He was a shade hesitant over comparisons with Zinedine Zidane and Rivaldo but then rallied to his own cause. \"I can defend, too,\" Deco said mischievously. Dmitri Loskov Russia: age 29, caps 6 The Lokomotiv Moscow captain is not cut out for the part of brash newcomer this summer. He turns 30 in February and has already weathered periods when he fell out of fashion, having been omitted from Russia's squad for the 2002 World Cup finals. Nonetheless the midfielder is also the kind of figure who is bound to be recalled sooner or later. It is the sheer solidity of his craft that ought to give his team substance at Euro 2004. Internazionale were the unwilling measure of his value during their 3-0 defeat in Moscow in this season's Champions League. Loskov scored the first deftly, dummied for the second and set up the third. The result helped Lokomotiv survive beyond Christmas for the second successive season. Loskov, signed in 1999, has been closely bound up with a club whose players and their families live at the club's training complex. He has not been granted the heedless, self-absorbed existence of a celebrity. The death of his son Rodion in 2001, when he was just a few weeks old, devastated him. But he was able to maintain his influence on the pitch and Lokomotiv emerged from the first group phase of the Champions League last season thanks to his efforts in Istanbul, where he scored one and fashioned the other in a 2-1 win over Galatasaray. \"If an actor is playing before a small audience, he usually performs badly,\" said Loskov. \"The same thing is true of me. I am inspired by the big stage.\" The audience at 2004 can look forward to watching a perfectly two-footed player, whether shooting, passing or taking free-kicks. Wesley Sneijder Holland: age 19, caps 2, goal 1 At times of crisis Dutch football turns to youth. There was hard thinking to be done after Holland were beaten 1-0 at Hampden in the first leg of the play-offs. There seemed a real prospect that they would have to endure the humiliation of defeat by Scotland. Dick Advocaat had pledged that he would resign if his team did not pull through in Amsterdam. The coach then tied his future to a man who had not even been among the seven substitutes in Glasgow. With candidates such as the three-times European Cup-winner Clarence Seedorf waiting, Advocaat plumped instead for Wesley Sneijder. The Ajax teenager had made his international debut only in March 2003, against Portugal in a friendly, but the coach was right to have faith in him. The 6-0 trampling of Scotland began when Sneijder turned away effortlessly from Neil McCann, ran 15 yards and steadied himself to lash a shot low into the net. Scoring is not even his real forte. Sneijder's set-pieces were aimed with a whipping accuracy that devastated the visitors. Andre Ooijer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Frank de Boer would all score from those deliveries. The youngster had exposed the weaknesses older players had failed to do in Glasgow. Sneijder, nurtured by Danny Blind in the Ajax youth system, is deceptive. The slender, two-footed midfielder is hard to dislodge when in possession and Advocaat will find it difficult to sideline him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
