His memory was jogged however when recalling the picture of England\u2019s players crouched in a circle with their opponents in a show of support for their domestic struggles. Depending on your levels of cynicism, that enduring image is either a gesture of goodwill or a PR\u2019s dream but considering the strife in which Samoa still find themselves, it is worth revisiting \u2013 for you would get short odds on it happening again at full-time on Saturday. So much has changed in the ensuing three years \u2013 it was George Ford\u2019s first England start and on Saturday he captains the side along with Chris Robshaw \u2013 but for the Pacific Islanders, so much stays the same. And while there was plenty of logic to Dan Cole\u2019s explanation of why England\u2019s players would not be donating part of their match fees, equally there was inescapable disappointment in the squad\u2019s decision that, in effect, it is not their place to get involved; a shame that no one saw fit to put their head above the parapet. As it is, we are reduced once more to talking up Samoa\u2019s threat in terms of their propensity to hit big, or to conjure the odd hair-raising moment from nothing, but for all their talent, the day they have genuine hopes of upsetting England at Twickenham feels further away still than in 2014. \u201cOur skills have got to be on the money because if not they\u2019ll just come for you, flying off the line and wanting to hurt you,\u201d Ford said. \u201cOur basics have got to be brilliant. Touch wood I\u2019ve never been in a car crash but I can imagine it\u2019s as close to one as you can come. They get their energy from doing something like that and they\u2019re very good at it, it\u2019s no coincidence they\u2019ve done it on numerous occasions. It\u2019s our job to make sure they don\u2019t get too many by being smart.\u201d It is to the credit of England\u2019s defence coach, Paul Gustard, that he broke the mould on Friday \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to stereotype people of certain descent. They hit hard but we have guys who hit hard too\u201d \u2013 but it is against an all too familiar backdrop that Eddie Jones truly shakes things up, out of choice, for the first time in his tenure. He has made tweaks to his starting XV before \u2013 and of course, numerous changes were forced on in Argentina over the summer \u2013 but Saturday marks the first time, after nearly two years at the helm, he rolls the dice at Twickenham. The absences of Nathan Hughes and both Vunipolas leave England considerably short on ball-carriers \u2013 precisely the kind of poser Jones will relish setting his new-look side. Jones promised an exciting XV and largely he has delivered with Maro Itoje, Ellis Genge and Sam Simmonds all players to quicken the pulse among the forwards and the backline is littered with eye-catching talent. While the backs are Ford\u2019s responsibility, Robshaw is taking charge of the forwards, back on the openside flank. The return to the No7 jersey is undoubtedly symbolic but Robshaw eschews the road to redemption narrative. \u201cAs you get a bit older you probably do get a bit more relaxed, you don\u2019t take things to heart as much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have that experience, you have the pain, you have the good times, the bad times, and you can see when there\u2019s a guy having a bit of a tough situation and you can speak to them. People often think about these Winston Churchill speeches, a lot of the time it\u2019s just being there for people; showing people you care.\u201d Jones continues to wax lyrical of the \u201cglue\u201d player he famously wrote off shortly before taking over as coach: \u201cWhat I admire about him is the consistency of his application of effort. He understands his game beautifully and doesn\u2019t try to play outside his game. He maximises what he\u2019s got and he\u2019s such a positive character around the team.\u201d If Jones knows what he is going to get from Robshaw, he is not averse to giving his players plenty of rope and there is the creeping sense he has picked a side whose instincts will be to look for width from the word go. He is unlikely to be pleased if that is the case, however, and one or two may find their World Cup hopes all but extinguished if that materialises. Rather, Jones has asked for a structured, controlled victory \u2013 the kind he will also want against Tonga in England\u2019s first World Cup match in 2019 \u2013 and he may warrant another call from his mother if England display the kind of haphazard approach they did against Samoa in 2014. Incidentally, that was the first of only two occasions Stuart Lancaster saw fit to pair Ford and Owen Farrell from the start \u2013 it did not really work, predominately because Farrell was out of form all autumn \u2013 while the man of the match that day was Robshaw, following a tireless performance at flanker. So much has changed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
