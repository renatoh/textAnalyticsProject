On at least three occasions, the chance for Australia to have relatively strong emissions policies were squandered, leaving many people in politics, industry and the environmental movement today wishing that something weaker \u2013 but therefore more politically feasible \u2013 had been instituted when it was possible. That legacy has meant a culture of extreme pragmatism has taken over the climate policy debate in Australia. Second-best policies have become the preferred option, until they\u2019ve been ruled out, and suddenly third-best policies are considered the only feasible option. This pragmatic turn has infected not only the political parties and some NGOs but also official, independent government offices, and left Australia with virtually no genuinely independent advice in the climate policy space. Last year we saw the once fiercely independent Climate Change Authority water down its advice to make it appear palatable to a Coalition party room containing MPs who don\u2019t believe climate change is really happening. And this month, Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, released a report recommending emissions cuts that are not in line with what the science demands. But with Australia\u2019s existing policies destined to push power prices up, decrease the reliability of the electricity system and increase emissions for decades to come, any emissions reduction policy is surely better than nothing. So there is perhaps much to be said for scientific advice that compromises on its principles of independence and evidence, in order to get something done. But has this turn greased the surface of a slope, leading to government having no honest advice? Has Australia\u2019s acceptance that the perfect is no longer possible meant we have lost sight of what really needs to be done? Finkel\u2019s political intervention to end the \u2018climate wars\u2019 Ahead of releasing his landmark report into the security and reliability of the National Electricity Market, Finkel appeared before Senate estimates. Traditionally, the chief scientist has been relied upon for independent scientific advice, both to government and the general public. It\u2019s a position that has remained independent of politics \u2013 a trusted source of information, not swayed by the gritty political realities of the day. Finkel\u2019s testimony before the Senate suggested his advice was not going to tell the government what the absolute best thing for them to do was but, rather, what they could do, given their political inclinations. Reading between the lines, it seemed he was saying it would be tailored so that it was palatable to the government of the day. \u201cWe will be making recommendations around policies that all of the states and territories and the government would ideally agree to around changes to the operation of the system,\u201d Finkel said. And the nearly universal thread in commentary around the Finkel review \u2013 both from those who have applauded it and those who have attacked it \u2013 has been to see it as a political document, attempting to find a policy that will do something to lower emissions but will also be palatable to the Coalition. Finkel, for his part, has denied his report was written \u201ccognisant of the political realities\u201d. According to Frank Jotzo, a climate economist at the Australian National University, there are three aspects of the report that demonstrate its political nature. \u201cFirstly, presenting the emission reduction challenge as very much an adjunct to reliability and affordability, which is directly in line with the way government approaches that question,\u201d Jotzo said. Secondly, and perhaps most obviously, Finkel\u2019s report recommended a clean energy target, rather than an emissions trading scheme or an emissions intensity scheme. \u201cAll analysis aside, that is exactly what you\u2019d do if you were looking for something that is politically acceptable to the government, where the government has ruled out an emissions trading scheme and an emissions intensity scheme \u2013 you go looking fsor the next best thing, which might be acceptable to the government.\u201d Thirdly, Jotzo said the very weak emissions reduction modelled \u2013 and essentially recommended \u2013 by Finkel, appeared to be something you\u2019d do if you were tailoring it to a hesitant government. \u201cIt could be interpreted as a an attempt to help smooth the way to make this acceptable to government,\u201d Jotzo said. Losing sight of the science That last point \u2013 the weak ambition of the emissions reductions \u2013 has raised the temperature of a lot of commentators. Signing the Paris agreement, Australia committed to an emissions reduction target of 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. As many have pointed out, Australia\u2019s target is not consistent with the aim of the Paris agreement, which is to limit warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C. But, regardless, a lot of work has been done examining how Australia could meet its weak 2030 targets. And, according to that analysis, the electricity sector has to play a huge role. The electricity sector accounts for more than a third of Australia\u2019s emissions and it is the cheapest place to make cuts \u2013 with zero emissions being entirely achievable. That\u2019s in contrast with other industries, like agriculture, where emissions cuts are incredibly difficult, or manufacturing and transport, which will be able to reduce emissions only after the electricity industry is decarbonised \u2013 by relying more on electricity, rather burning their own fossil fuels. Several bodies have recently estimated how much the electricity sector would need to cut its emissions by for Australia\u2019s entire economy to meet its current Paris targets. But, instead of relying on any of that work, Finkel modelled a cut in the electricity sector, which is numerically the same as the cuts needed across the whole economy \u2013 28% by 2030. Bill Hare from Climate Analytics, a climate scientist who has done this sort of modelling for many economies around the world, placed several comparable models of what Australia\u2019s electricity sector needs to cut on a single chart. The result is stark, with the cuts modelled by Finkel sticking out like a burning coal stack. \u201cFrom a scientific perspective this is quite shocking because the almost universal consensus from the modelling exercises for how to achieve the Paris agreement has the power sector doing a lot more than the rest of the economy everywhere in the world,\u201d Hare told the Guardian. Jotzo said it looks like it must have been done to make it palatable to the Coalition. \u201cWhy possibly would you make the assumption that there is a uniform emissions reduction across all sectors? That\u2019s really only if you want to softly softly get something going.\u201d Finkel has denied that the modelled cuts amount to a recommendation. But not only did he model emissions cuts that were inconsistent with the Paris agreement but he said any deeper cuts would cause problems for the energy system. And he recommended that, if more ambitious cuts were to be considered by government, the work done in his report would need to be redone, to examine their implications. \u201cThe adoption of a more ambitious target would have larger consequences for energy security as such a target would likely see a higher level of [variable renewable energy] incentivised,\u201d his report said. \u201cThe panel recommends that if a higher national target is to be considered, cost security and reliability implications should be re-examined.\u201d The level of cuts don\u2019t appear in his list of recommendations but, as the quote above makes clear, they emerge as a clear recommendation from the text of the report itself. Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne, said that statement made the chance of Australia meeting its Paris agreement targets much more unlikely. \u201cIn my view that has basically just put up a massive and unnecessary barrier for being more ambitious and won\u2019t really help end the so-called \u2018climate wars\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt basically will require anyone, like Labor, to do more work to argue that they can be more ambitious, without lights going out or costs going up. That doesn\u2019t sound particularly amenable to \u2018ending the war\u2019, unless Labor thinks 28% is acceptable.\u201d Some commentators were surprised that Finkel didn\u2019t simply model a range of scenarios and leave it up to the government to choose an appropriate level of ambition. \u201cWhat surprised me was there was a recommendation on the extent of emissions reduction to be targeted at all,\u201d Jotzo said. \u201cThose decisions could have been left to government.\u201d But despite all evidence showing such cuts were inconsistent with Australia\u2019s international obligations, in an interview with the Guardian immediately following the review\u2019s release, Finkel was asked whether the cuts would be enough to meet the Paris agreement. Finkel said: \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know.\u201d That claim of ignorance came even though one of the key reports that considered the question being produced by the Climate Change Authority, of which Finkel is a member. It suggested cuts of at least twice that modelled by Finkel were needed in the electricity sector. Eroding the Climate Change Authority That particular report by the Climate Change Authority caused a major spat, which closely mirrors the controversy around Finkel\u2019s new report, and highlights the dangerous position Australia could be heading towards. In September last year, the Climate Change Authority released a review, recommending how Australia can meet its Paris targets. It\u2019s worth noting that the Climate Change Authority was once a body that stuck to the science and wasn\u2019t influenced by the attitude of the current government. Under chair Bernie Fraser, it didn\u2019t hold back from telling the government uncomfortable truths. For example, in 2015, when the government proposed its emissions targets that were later agreed to in Paris, Fraser released a statement, making several confronting \u201cobservations\u201d about the government\u2019s targets. Among those observations, he noted they were too weak, said they would place \u201cAustralia at or near the bottom of the group of countries we generally compare ourselves with\u201d and criticised the government\u2019s claim that \u201cAustralia outperformed its Kyoto protocol first commitment\u201d, noting those targets allowed Australia\u2019s emissions to keep rising. By that time, it was government policy to axe the Climate Change Authority, something the Coalition has not managed to pass through the parliament. But they have successfully ignored them and since stacked the board of the \u201cindependent\u201d body with former conservative politicians and lobbyists. Under a new leadership, and with many new members, the authority\u2019s September 2016 report had clearly been designed to present recommendations that, rather than being informed by the science and risked making the government uncomfortable, were designed to be palatable to the Coalition. Rather than proposing good policy, the report tried to find policy that might be acceptable to a government that didn\u2019t want to take action on climate change. As a result, it suggested the Direct Action policy should be strengthened and an emissions intensity scheme should be introduced to the electricity sector. Moreover, rather than analysing what policies could help meet a \u201ctwo-degree pathway\u201d \u2013 one that would help limit global warming to 2C \u2013 it analysed policy that might help Australia meet its existing emissions targets. But, of course, all the science available demonstrated those targets were completely inadequate to meet the 2C goal. Two members of the authority \u2013 climate scientist David Karoly and economist Clive Hamilton \u2013 were so outraged by the move that they essentially split from the other members and released what they called a \u201cminority report\u201d. In their report, they said the authority\u2019s recommendations were \u201cframed to suit a particular assessment of the political circumstances prevailing in the current parliament\u201d, instead of recommending policy based on science and economics, and were \u201cseemingly based on a reading from a political crystal ball\u201d. \u201cAttempts to craft \u2018politically realistic\u2019 policies risk being seen as partisan and damage the authority\u2019s reputation for independence,\u201d Karoly and Hamilton said. Jotzo, who is not associated with the authority, was also highly critical of the main report. \u201cThe intent clearly is to help policy progress in the medium term,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it risks locking in a policy suite that will not deliver much, or may cost too much.\u201d Since then Hamilton and two other members of the authority have resigned over the government\u2019s attitude to climate change and to the authority. But there was debate about the virtue of the Climate Change Authority\u2019s compromised move. Some of those who had watched the climate wars continue for nine years thought it presented a thread that the Coalition could grab \u2013 a last-ditch effort to allow a bipartisan approach to climate policy. Finkel was, and remains, a member of the authority and defended the controversial 2016 report against Hamilton and Karoly\u2019s criticisms as not only \u201cevidence based\u201d but also \u201cclever\u201d. He claimed criticism of the report was based on \u201cclickbait headlines\u201d and commentators who had not bothered to read the report. In the end the Climate Change Authority\u2019s gamble was lost. The government rejected its recommendations out of hand. The compromised advice was for nothing and, if anything, just shifted the policy debate further down that compromised path. The \u2018climate wars\u2019 that motivate compromised advice The political calculation made by that Climate Change Authority report, and the Finkel review, is identical. The idea is that there is no point making recommendations that will be ignored by government, so why not present something that they might listen to? \u201cReally when an independent review is done, then it can take two approaches,\u201d Jotzo said. \u201cOne is to point out the principles and do the analysis on the basis of those principles and come out with deeply principled recommendations. \u201cOr alternatively it can seek to provide a way to achieve political compromise.\u201d The motivation for coming out with a report that is not entirely principled cannot be understood without understanding the history of Australia\u2019s so-called \u201cclimate wars\u201d, which has been fueled by relatively ambitious proposals failing due to political realities. This year represents, by some accounting, the 10th anniversary of the war. In 2007, both major parties, led by John Howard and Kevin Rudd, went to the election promising an emissions trading scheme. Rudd won the election but, by the time he tried to get the emissions trading scheme through the parliament, the Coalition had shifted to oppose it. They managed to block the passage of the scheme, with the help of the Greens, who opposed it because the targets were too weak, and there was no mechanism by which to ratchet them up. From there, it seemed to be a matter of history repeating itself. In November 2011, the Labor party, led by Julia Gillard, passed another emissions trading scheme through the parliament. Labelled a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d by the Coalition, it was axed after Tony Abbott campaigned and won the 2013 federal election with a central policy of \u201caxing the tax\u201d. Then, of course, Malcolm Turnbull lost the leadership of the Coalition in 2009 over his support for an emissions trading scheme, only getting it back with the apparent promise to not adopt it again. Similarly, just when it looked like the Coalition could be coaxed to support an emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector, Turnbull was forced to rule it out. \u201cThat\u2019s the root of all of this,\u201d Jotzo said. \u201cThe repeated experience that the political forces against meaningful climate policy in Australia are very strong. \u201cThere have been a number of these kinds of experiences in succession where policy approaches that, in retrospect, seem relatively ambitious were tried and ultimately failed for one reason or another. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind the scaling back of the advice that is provided by these bodies and organisations.\u201d The closest Australia has come to meaningful climate policy was when it had some meaningful climate policy: the \u201ccarbon tax\u201d. Jotzo said the lessons from that appeared to be that a fundamentally worse policy \u2013 but one that was politically more feasible \u2013 would have been better, all things considered. \u201cIf you look back at that and say, \u2018Hang on, what else could have been done to help make it last\u201d\u2019, then immediately people would say it could have started with less ambition - a lower price [on carbon],\u201d Jotzo said. \u201cAnd something could have been done on electricity prices to neutralise electricity prices as an issue. And doing that would have compromised the efficiency of the scheme but in retrospect you would now say it would have given it a chance of survival.\u201d But whether that sort of calculation ought to be made by the chief scientist \u2013 and if so, whether he\u2019s made it correctly \u2013 has split commentators and analysts. David Karoly, the member of the Climate Change Authority who co-authored the \u201cminority report\u201d in 2016 is highly critical of Finkel\u2019s review, for the same reason he was critical of the politically motivated authority report. \u201cOne of the reasons Alan Finkel was appointed as chair of this electricity review was because he was appointed chief scientist by the current government,\u201d Karoly said, arguing that this government wants to control what advice they receive. \u201cThat is not providing independent advice \u2013 that is giving advice that is considered to be acceptable by the paymasters.\u201d When pushed, Karoly accepted that it could be worth compromising the principle of independent advice, if that compromised advice could really help get meaningful climate policy accepted by government. But he thinks Finkel\u2019s recommendations don\u2019t do that. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to a part-way solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like getting from Melbourne to Tasmania \u2013 building a bridge that gets you a third of the way doesn\u2019t get you there at all. \u201cThe whole way there is zero emissions ... I know that the Liberal party doesn\u2019t want to know about that but that is what we have to do.\u201d Jotzo is more positive about the progress made by Finkel\u2019s political intervention. \u201cSo, the initial reaction is really very positive in that there was really very vocal support from many parts of industry \u2013 the energy industry in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also clearly had cabinet clearly supporting the Finkel recommendations and we had Labor in opposition with some tentative support for the recommendations. \u201cAnd that in itself is a better situation than we\u2019ve had for a very long time in Australian climate policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that the Finkel review had a crack at it.\u201d But he said there was a risk in having \u201cindependent reviews\u201d going down this more political path, and recommending policy options that aren\u2019t the best ones, given the evidence at hand. \u201cIf it all falls in a heap, then certainly that gamble was lost and for sure there\u2019s a problem. As we move from first best solution to second best and so forth, there\u2019s a risk that we lose sight of what first-best would actually look like \u2013 and therefore what we should be aiming next time around.\u201d Alan Finkel declined several requests for an interview for this piece."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
