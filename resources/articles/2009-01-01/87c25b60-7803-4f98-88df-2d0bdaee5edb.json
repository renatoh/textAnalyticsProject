Nearly 2,500 years after the Greeks fought the Persians in the straits, the bay has become symbolic of another battle that is brewing on Europe's south-eastern front. The build-up of decommissioned ships, like the empty tourist shops and ancient sites devoid of happy holidaymakers, is symptomatic of the economic crisis that is enveloping Greece, the EU's weakest economy. \"The recession,\" declared today's left-leaning Eleftherotypia in a banner front-page headline, \"is at our door.\" Shipping and tourism \u2013 at 25% the biggest single contributors to the country's gross domestic product \u2013 are not the only sectors bracing themselves for a fall in foreign demand. After years of enjoying high growth rates \u2013 at 4%, almost double the eurozone average \u2013 Greeks have been told to ready themselves for fiscal hardship. On almost every front they have been bombarded by bad news: that unemployment, currently at 7.4%, will worsen in the coming year; that economic growth will fall to near zero; that further austerity measures, in the form of taxes and government cutbacks, are almost certainly on the way. Last week, in a move that dealt another psychological blow, the country became the first western European economy to have its credit-rating downgraded, highlighting fears over its huge public-sector debt, the worst in the 16-member eurozone, and making the prospect of further borrowing to finance it ever more costly. Announcing the decision, the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's said the ongoing financial crisis had exacerbated \"an underlying loss of competitiveness\" in the Greek economy. Today, in a report cataloguing Greece's economic woes, the European commission said the country's exports, not least to the recession-hit neighbouring Balkans, will also decline dramatically in the coming months. The Athens stock exchange, already at a five-year low, fell a further 2%. The outlook could not be further from the economic renaissance that followed the 2004 Athens Olympics. With the exception of the Hungarians, Greeks are now the most pessimistic people in Europe, according to EU polls. \"A financial tsunami is on its way and Greece is less prepared than it should be to deal with it,\" said the political scientist Dimitris Keridis. \"Successive governments did not use the good times to put the country's economic house in order and now the bad times are with us.\" Reining in a debt forecast to increase in 2009 to more than 91.4% of GDP is, economists agree, the single biggest priority for an economy racked by structural problems and thirsting for reform. But with their wafer-thin majority, the ruling conservatives have little room for manoeuvre. Trailing the opposition socialists by a steady 5 percentage points has made the task in hand even harder. Unpopular reforms, unprecedented youth unemployment and disaffection over the economy caused riots in December that caused about \u20ac1bn (\u00a3906m) of damage in Athens alone. Now, with unemployment rising and union unrest gathering pace, there are fears that Greece will soon erupt again. \"Every day shops are closing, people are being laid off, and factories are shutting down,\" said Stathis Anestis, spokesman at the Greek TUC, which represents 1.5 million workers. \"And with the global economic crisis only just beginning to be felt here, there is worse to come. The social upheaval we saw in December is going to be nothing next to the explosion we are going to see in the coming months.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
