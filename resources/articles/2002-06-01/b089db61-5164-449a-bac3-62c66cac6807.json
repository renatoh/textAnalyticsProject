Double that figure", "bodyText": "Bargain-basement prices for last-minute holiday deals can be misleading, with a \u00a399 holiday sometimes costing more than double its advertised price because of hidden extras, according to an Observer investigation. Although there is a rash of holidays being advertised for under \u00a399 as a result of a larger-than-usual number of breaks remaining unsold in June, we found it impossible to get a deal for this price after several days' research. One holiday to Cala Blanca in Menorca advertised by ebookers.com quoted a price of \u00a399 per person for seven nights' self catering. On ringing to book it, we were told the total cost was \u00a3221 for one person because the quoted price was based on two people travelling. Yet the cost for two people was actually \u00a3322 rather than \u00a3198 because it included a \u00a330 underoccupancy fee each, plus a \u00a37 security fee, \u00a310 administration fee and \u00a315 transfers per person. The website price did not specify that a minimum of two people needed to travel or that prices were 'from' \u00a399 per person. Small print on the website did say: 'There may be additional charges for accommodation underoccupancy/ ticket on departure charge/resort transfers/in-flight meals/ pre-bookable seats/taxes.' Bruce Treloar, lead officer on travel for the Trading Standards Institute, said: 'We find this totally misleading. This is a total lack of transparency. If they make it a \u00a399 price and it is not even a \"from\" price it is misleading - they have offered a price no one can get. But we cannot investigate until consumers complain. This is getting out of hand - people just don't know what they are going to pay.' An ebookers spokesman said: 'We try very very hard to be honest with our customers. This is something we will look into.' Another holiday being offered by the travel company Lincoln Direct on Teletextholidays.co.uk for \u00a3125 to Menorca turned out to cost an additional \u00a341 when the cost of transfers (\u00a315), ticket on departure (\u00a310), booking fee (\u00a39) and security fee (\u00a37) were added on. A Teletext spokeswoman said travellers are always alerted to the extra costs by individual travel companies when making telephone bookings. We also followed up a one-week \u00a350 holiday to Corfu, on Teletext which turned out never to have existed when we phoned the firm offering the deal, called Holidays by Phone. Reservationist Emma Howcroft claimed that Teletext had quoted incorrect prices for its packages on various occasions over the last nine months. However Teletext said all information it carried was supplied by travel companies. There is a growing move among travel companies to unpackage the package holiday, offering a no-frills price and charging for everything from meals and transfers to pre-booked seats, which are considered extras. However, customers are not given the choice about paying for administration and booking fees and ticket on departure, even though their cost is not included in the initial holiday price. \u00b7 Find out where your local Trading Standards office is on the website www.tradingstandards.gov.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
