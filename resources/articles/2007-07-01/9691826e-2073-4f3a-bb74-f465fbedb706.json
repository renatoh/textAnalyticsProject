The Birmingham-based company was forced to recall more than a million chocolate bars last June, after changing its policy on testing for the bacteria from permitting none to allowing a \"tolerance level\". Although 36 positive tests for salmonella were recorded in January and February 2006, it was not until the suffering of victims several months later was linked to Cadbury that the products were pulled from the shelves. At Birmingham crown court, the recorder, James Guthrie QC, said that the confectioner had fallen \"seriously short\" of its obligations. The avoidance of waste that came as a result of no longer destroying chocolate which tested positive and the accompanying reduction in costs contributed to a lack of scrutiny to the new system, he said. But he did not believe that the change had been driven by a cynical desire to cut costs. Solicitor Sallie Booth, representing 12 of the 30 victims claiming compensation, said her clients were relieved by the firm's guilty plea. \"The \u00a31m fine sends a clear message that companies who have a great deal of responsibility for protecting public health cannot afford to ignore a potentially dangerous situation, and cannot take a risk with the public's health.\" Cadbury was also ordered to pay costs of more than \u00a3150,000. But the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, Chris Huhne, said the fine was far too small to give a multinational such as Cadbury an incentive to behave better. \"This fine represents just 0.1% of the company's pretax profits last year, which is a pinprick on the hide of the elephant,\" he said. The judge said Cadbury now accepted that the testing system introduced in 2003, which was based on a misunderstanding of scientific literature, was \"badly flawed and wrong\". But he added: \"I do not believe that at the time of the introduction Cadbury consciously thought they were taking a risk with people's health.\" Cadbury recorded several positive results for different strains of salmonella under its new system before the cases in 2006 which led to the food poisoning, and the products were released for sale, according to Birmingham city council. Cadbury, which employs 6,000 people in the UK, has spent \u00a320m on improvements at its factory. The firm's barrister, Anthony Scrivener QC, said: \"Negligence we admit, but we certainly do not admit that this was done deliberately to save money and nor is there any evidence to support that conclusion.\" Cadbury had pleaded guilty to a total of nine food safety and hygiene offences, including placing unsafe products on the market and failing to inform the authorities, and six charges relating to its factory at Marlbrook, near Leominster in Herefordshire, where the rare Montevideo strain of salmonella got into the system through a leaky pipe and was able to spread throughout the manufacturing process due to other flaws. Victims, who the judge said suffered from prolonged vomiting and diarrhoea, ranged from a nine-month-old baby to elderly people. Cadbury apologised, offered its \"sincere regrets\" to the victims and said it accepted the fine unreservedly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
