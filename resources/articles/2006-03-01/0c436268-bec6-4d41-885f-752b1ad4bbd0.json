Even before Tony Blair became leader, wealthy individuals were competing with one another for the attention of the rising stars (Prescott and Brown kept in dark, March 18). There was an informal political club of supporters, with its roots in the Wilson-Callaghan, era that has never entirely been understood outside the circle of immediate donors and their political beneficiaries. There is nothing wrong with encouraging private interests to fund a party of the centre-left if both sides engage with their eyes open. But we have to ask a number of questions. Why have both sides been so desperate for so long not to have it revealed that they are engaged with one another? Why were prominent business figures as early as the mid-1990s operating opaquely to fund the private offices of rising politicians, internal party campaigns and individual bids for power? Who were they? What were their interconnections? What did they get in return? Did any of them have overseas connections? Who is now investigating this matter of central public interest? Ten years on, it is not good enough for New Labour to say that - with \u00a314m or so in the bank as almost certainly permanent loans - all future loans will be transparent. Not only these loans, but all private-sector funds - not only to the party, but to past individual political campaigns, associated thinktanks and bids for leadership in cash or in kind (such as the loan of office space) in the 1990s - should be investigated by an independent party commission, to assess the scale of the problem and create more effective rules for future private-sector engagement with political funding. In addition, organisations and individual fundraisers who claim a link to the Labour party but are not under its jurisdiction must be brought under direct NEC control. The departure of the current leader and prime minister might be a suitable time to end the opaque relations between a few wealthy Labour supporters and those particular party factions which act as routes for funds into the party. A new leader might not only commit him or herself to sound and transparent party finance, but return to the more democratic aspects of modernisation abandoned in the mid-1990s. Tim Pendry Former deputy chair, Labour Finance and Industry Group These latest revelations show there is now a two-tier Labour party. The official party with its elected officials and committees remains in place, but the real decisions are made in No 10. With membership at an all-time low and support ebbing in key areas, the justification for supporting Blair because he is electorally successful is becoming a thing of the past. The longer-term impact on the political process is more damaging. Voters may not react suddenly to the embrace of Tory policies, but Tory sleaze is a different matter. Blair came into office to clean up politics. He is now besmirched and the damage extends across the political spectrum. No doubt Jack Dromey will be under intense pressure to remain loyal. It is not just Labour supporters who will hope that he probes into the murk. Trevor Fisher Stafford It's hard to believe that people at the top of the Labour party were completely ignorant. Jack Dromey is the treasurer and Gordon Brown is a highly experienced money man, for goodness sake. They, and many others, must have known about the parlous state of the party's finances. Did they not wonder how it was possible to do everything that an extra \u00a314m buys at election time? Bob Rotheram Nottingham As life-long members of the Labour party, we have written to the party chairman asking him to initiate disciplinary action against Tony Blair for bringing the party into disrepute by accepting secret loans and failing to keep the responsible party officials informed. We would urge all other party members to do the same. Tony and Phyllis Palmer Sheffield According to polls, a large majority perceive Blair's government as being as sleazy as Major's. But there is one significant difference. Individual members have not benefited, there have been no brown envelopes. And now it has now emerged that the Conservatives had \u00a320m in loans, \u00a36m more than Labour. Peter Haymes Felixstowe, Suffolk Your pictures of the 20 top donors or lenders to Labour who have received or are up for honours (Labour loan row, March 17) included Gulam Noon. But unlike others listed, you did not mention his philanthropy. Gulam Noon is a truly public-spirited man who has put hundreds of thousands of pounds into community projects in Tower Hamlets. He is a rare and exemplary employer, giving free English lessons in company time to his largely immigrant workforce and paying for local adult education classes. For these good reasons he is a member of the Advisory Board for Naturalisation and Integration, which I chaired until a year ago, indeed encouraged him to apply to join, on the advice both of community leaders and former officials of the Prince's Fund. Bernard Crick Edinburgh Positive impressions of how the UK (or rather London) has changed since the late 1960s are accurate (There's no new push for Blair to go, March 18), but ignore something very important: the evidence that people are, in general, less happy than they were then - which is probably they drink so much. Yes, we have more money in our pockets, but, much more important, income inequality hasn't improved. Very many aren't \"living in unusually good times\".
