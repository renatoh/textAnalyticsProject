Hmmm? Best Ongoing Bid For Olympic Status - Professional Bodybuilding Which is based on the claim that the huge-breasted 300lb. monsters do NOT take steroids. And that the strangely swollen stomachs of certain competitors are NOT caused by veterinary growth-hormone induced hypertrophy of the internal organs. The 2002 Incidental Sports Poetry Award goes to (riiiiiiiip) Rally Driving! It's so much more than a bunch of Finns driving hatch-backs around in mud you know. I give you \"Natalie Barrat's signature fluorescent yellow Gp N Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI\". I give you \"Key West James Fowler, Satsuma Hugh Gray, Kissimme\". What does it mean? Who cares? Here's a list of female drivers - Yasmin Alhilli, Lucy Ford-Hutchinson, Mich\u00e8le Mouton, Penny Mallory, Debra Kibble, Marjo Victoria, Sabrina Shaw and Shirley Van Damme - awesome! But the dog's testes have gotta be the teaming up of Simon Hughes with Phil Pugh and Cuthbert Dibble with Pete Grubb in this years Great Britain Rally (unfortunately there is no rally driver called Barney McGrew). Most Frightening Physical Resemblance To Lenny And His Lickle Mouse Out Of John Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men - Razor 'Neil' Ruddock sat next to Frankie Dettori MBE on BBC's Question of Sport Razor looked even taller than usual, presumably because the T-Rex faced man-mountain was sat on the massive stack of fivers he won as a result of his successful legal action against Swindon Town FC. And he kept on looking at tiny Frankie with what looked suspiciously like fondness. No! Razor! Don't pick him up and stroke him! AAAAARGH! Too late. Anybody got a hankie? Rubbishest Sports-Related Advert - Vinnie Jones lusting after Latino chicks while smiling and - oh my God - dancing. Like an elk Rumours that Bacardi also shot a pink-pound procuring version set in a Sydney leather bar have yet to be substantiated. Greatest Sporting Tragedy - Brit Pig Racing, trailing smoke, nosedives into hill (squeeeeeeeeal ka-BOOOOOOM!) Hamstrung by old age and then nailed by the foot'n'mouth fiasco, this ancient country craft then had its hospice bed shat on by hysterical \"animal rights\" ninnies. Who also buggered up the Xmas turkey racing at Walthamstow dog track. Proof that humourlessness is an amino-acid deficiency related disorder. Best Sporting Film - Pig A heart-warming romantic comedy set in the ruthless world of American pig racing. Which has yet to be made. Or written. But I've got the synopsis. Funniest On-Going Sporting Slow Motion Car Crash - Leeds United You keep thinking things can't get any worse - but they do. Cockney player stamps on a Spaniard's head. Cockney manger says \"it was half a dozen of one and six of the other\". Hilarious! It's karma, dude. Leeds are suffering from the Curse Of Revie which will only be lifted when they apologise for the 1970s and hand back all those runners-up medals they only won by cheating. Meanwhile the First Division collectively cacks its shorts in anticipatory terror. Rubbishest Sports Question 0f 2002 - some BBC nerd asking gorgeous, pouting Anna Kornikova (who earns like about 200 squillion spondoolicks like a second) if she was going to give up \"tennis\" Like, duh! 2002's Rubbishest Sporting TV moment Stiff competition here from every episode of They Think It's All Over. And The Premiership's stings for Coca-Cola (featuring the three-legged freak and his pet mole) and The Championship's hideously over-repeated PlayStation plugs (football knocks priests of bike etc). But the biscuit is taken by the unfunny public school twot Johnny 'unfunny public school twot' Vaughan AND that nice Gaz Lineker who BOTH had us in stitches with their hilarious renderings of an hilarious American report of a World Cup game. \"He top-bodies the sphere into the score bag, and Mexico have a double negative stat!\" Hilarious! Except that that were both quoting a spoof report from this very website. The twots. Best Sports Radio Station goes to Radio Five Live Despite ferocious competition from TalkSport's incredibly seductive blending of sports with foam-flecked phone-ins about asylum seekers getting driving lessons on the rates and why it's OK to murder burglars. And despite the fact that Five Live still bangs on about bloody golf. ALL the time. But this year did see the return of THE best sports radio phone in programme ever - Baker And Kelly Upfront. Plus waffling Tory bore David 'Truffle Hound' Mellor FINALLY left 606 to spend more time with his huge, fat wobbly gut. HUZZAH! 2002's Least Factually Correct Sports Columnist - Steven Wells of Guardian Unlimited Not only did he claim that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain hated sports (when in fact he loved them to pieces and was an accomplished high school wrestler) but he also predicted that the English RU team would get \"mashed\" by the colonials. The idiot then compounded a year's worth of syntax-mangling factual inexactitude by claiming in his allegedly humorous end of the year column that the 2002 Great Britain Rally featured a driver and navigator named Cuthbert Dibble and Pete Grubb. Which it quite obviously didn't. What an arsehole!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
