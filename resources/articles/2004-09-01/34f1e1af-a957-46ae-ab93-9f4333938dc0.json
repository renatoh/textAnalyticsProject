Tours are tailor-made for each school group, and can be adapted to cover a range of topics including English, history and religious studies. Students take part in a role-play activity where they take on the role of novices who are disturbed during a Latin lesson by a monk who has discovered King Arthur's bones. From here they learn the legend of King Arthur, and take part in a creative writing activity. The abbey also puts on living history shows every day from April until the end of October, and characters include three monks who lived at the abbey in 1538. Pupils can see the site of the tomb where the bones were found in 1191, and the site of the black marble tomb in the Great Church where King Edward I put the bones in front of the High Altar in 1278. Schools are sent out worksheets in advance of a visit to the abbey, explaining the legend of King Arthur, and teachers are encouraged to attend a pre-visit. From September 13-19 the Abbey is running a demonstration of medieval pottery skills using an authentic kiln. Glastonbury Abbey, The Abbey Gatehouse, Magdalene Street, Glastonbury, Somerset BA6 9EL www.glastonburyabbey.com King Arthur's Great Halls King Arthur's Great Halls were built in the 1930s by Frederick Glasscock, a custard millionaire, and are the only intact building in the world dedicated to the story of King Arthur. The halls are decked out with 72 stained-glass windows, each of which depicts a key feature of the legend, including the virtue of the knights, their shields, weapons and coats of arms. The main attraction at the halls is the light show, narrated by Robert Powell, which explains the legend of King Arthur. School groups can complete an explorer's quiz as part of a tour, and further educational materials examining art, design, architecture and mythology can be provided on request. King Arthur's Great Halls, Fore Street, Tintagel, Cornwall www.kingarthursgreathalls.com King Arthur's Labyrinth King Arthur's Labyrinth is an underground network of tunnels and caverns in which Welsh legends of King Arthur are retold using narrative, music, light and tableaux. Arthur is a Dark Age war leader, as opposed to the medieval Arthur depicted in the recent film. School groups enter the labyrinth on a boat that sails along an underground river. They are led through the stories of Arthur by Cerys, a young girl who falls asleep and begins dreaming. When the boat comes to a stop beyond a waterfall, pupils are led on foot to a series of caverns within the labyrinth. There further stories are told, including King Rhitta and the Beards and the battle of Camlan. Stories will appeal to a range of key stages, although the majority of school visits are from key stage 2 groups. Teachers are welcome to attend a pre-visit, and the labyrinth has a resource pack for teachers that can be sent out in advance of a visit.
