Given he is a man, few observers took too much notice when Ince threw his toys out of the pram at Yeovil on Tuesday night after his Blackpool side lost a Championship match 1-0 and had three of players sent off just before the final whistle. \"It's been, all in all, a crap night,\" said Ince after only his second game back prowling the technical area following a five-match stadium ban for abusing officials. \"It's been a crap journey down. The Football League gave us a crap game on a Tuesday night at Yeovil which is crap.\" Poor Yeovil; poor Somerset. And poor Dan Westwell. A photographer, Westwell was working at Millwall's 2-2 home Championship draw with Nottingham Forest, also on Tuesday night, when one of Billy Davies's staff approached and ordered him to stop taking photographs of the Forest manager. As volatile as they come, Davies \u2013 who really does not like having his picture taken \u2013 has a history of altercations with photographers. But then he is far from the first football manager guilty of indulging in cringe inducingly precious behaviour. At Sunderland, for instance, Roy Keane's press officer had a special routine for away grounds which involved walking the route from the dressing room to the venue for the post-match media conference four times. This quadruple dress rehearsal was designed to negate the possibility of any wrong turns, meetings with locked doors or encounters with groups of people. Roy, you see, did not like having his boat rocked in any way. Or his personal space invaded. The TV person who once, casually, unthinkingly, patted him on the back after an interview will not repeat that mistake in a hurry. At Sunderland, they still talk of the time when club business forced Keane to miss his team's flight \u2013 on a private plane \u2013 to a pre-season training camp in Portugal. Instead he was forced to take the last seat on a holiday charter flight to Faro, an experience which seemingly left him thunder-faced and incapable of speech for some time. Even the most balanced down-to-earth types can become a bit spoilt when, \u00e0 la most football managers, they are surrounded by people constantly saying \"yes\" and offered every conceivable comfort and convenience. The otherwise refreshingly sane Mark Hughes, fresh from having his every whim catered for at Manchester City, developed worrying signs of hubris when he took over at Fulham. First, he wanted a bigger office, bigger desk, better chair and superior computer. Then, at training, the kit men were ordered to line up the ice buckets in perfect symmetry and arrange the drinks bottles so their labels were all displayed at the manager's preferred angle. If a chastening experience at Queens Park Rangers followed by a new much more mud-on-boots life at Stoke has restored Hughes to normal, all managers are control freaks, all harbour their little foibles. There is the former international coach, a generally ultra-sensible, extremely likable, man, who went through a phase of demanding to have a brand new training top, fresh from the packet, to put on every morning during squad get-togethers. Then there are the problems exacerbated by managerial entourages. I remember arriving slightly ahead of schedule for an interview appointment only to see the manager in question politely waiting with a media minder on the other side of a training pitch. As I walked, reasonably briskly, across the expanse of green the press man looked increasingly impatient. \"Why didn't you run, Louise?\" he said. \"You should have run, X shouldn't be kept waiting!\" Another time I had to conduct an interview with a player on a plane, kneeling in front of his business-class seat. He looked embarrassed, the press officer didn't. The trouble with Ince and Davies, though, is that they need little encouragement to show off their inner two-year-olds. Meanwhile Dan Westwell would probably be best advised to concentrate on capturing images of Andy Reid. Once again Forest's outstanding player at Millwall, Reid could yet prove responsible for inflicting Davies on the Premier League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
