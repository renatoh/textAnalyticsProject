But if prizes are about generating curiosity and discussion, then it is an excellent line-up that asks a series of important questions, such as how serious is satire, how big does a \u201cbig novel\u201d have to be, and when is a short story not a short story? Everyone loves a David and Goliath story, so first reactions have focused on the historical crime writer, published by a tiny Scottish imprint, who stared down big hitters. Graeme Macrae Burnet\u2019s second novel, His Bloody Project, was released in paperback in November and ignored by all but one national newspaper. But it will be reissued in hardback next month. Subtitled Documents relating to the case of Roderick Macrae, it satisfies the Booker jury\u2019s quest for books that \u201ctake risks with language and form\u201d, by wrapping the memoir of a teenage crofter, awaiting trial for triple murder in Inverness in 1869, in the faux-diary of the author who \u201cdiscovered\u201d the tale while researching his own Highland roots. \u201cI have largely restricted my interventions to matters of punctuation and paragraphing,\u201d explains the narrator. There\u2019s a healthy dose of Kafka as well as Flann O\u2019Brien in Roderick\u2019s account \u2026\u201d wrote Justine Jordan in the Guardian. It is one of two contenders that could loosely be classified as genre, along with Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s psychological thriller Eileen, the only first novel to survive the cut. Though I admired Ian McGuire\u2019s seafaring yarn The North Water, I can see why His Bloody Project pipped it to this shortlist: it is an interesting hybrid of crime thriller and historical fiction. It is about as far as it could be from the other historical novel on the list, Do Not Say We Have Nothing, by Madeleine Thien which is a brilliant but demanding meditation on language and memory set over half a century of Chinese history. Centred on the oppression of musicians from the cultural revolution to Tiananmen Square and beyond, it takes its name from the Chinese translation, via Russian, of a line from the French socialist anthem The Internationale. Thien, the daughter of a Chinese mother and Malaysian father, who was born in and lives in Canada, is no stranger to hard history: her previous novel, Dogs at the Perimeter, dealt with the Cambodian genocide. Both Burnett and Thien are the beneficiaries of loyal indie publishers - Thien of Granta and Burnet of Scottish tiddler Sarabande. Another indie, Oneworld - publisher of Marlon James\u2019s 2015 Booker winner A Brief History of Seven Killings - is behind Paul Beatty\u2019s The Sellout. This American novel, premised on the disappearance of a whole city from the map of California, raises the flag for satire in prize not chiefly known for its sense of humour. \u201cEvery stereotype, rivalry and anxiety about race in the US is laid bare,\u201d according to reviewer Reni Eddo-Lodge. Very different again is Hot Milk, from Deborah Levy, who makes a teasing addition to a growing body of pared-back novels by women on the complexities of the human condition. Where Levy focuses on the experience of a young woman, David Szalay looks at masculinity. All That Man Is unfolds in a series of pen portraits. Is it a novel? The critics who reviewed it for the Guardian and Observer both concluded that it was really a collection of short stories, reopening a debate that has resurfaced from time to time since David Mitchell\u2019s Cloud Atlas hit the shortlist back in 2004. Do we care? As reviewer Will Skidelsky remarked, \u201cAs long as readers don\u2019t feel cheated, they will find a great deal to enjoy\u201d. It\u2019s in such discussions that the life of literature lies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
