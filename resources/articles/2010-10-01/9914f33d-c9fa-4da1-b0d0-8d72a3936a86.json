The lottery fund will provide \u00a34m and the mayor of London \u00a31m under the plans to develop the Black Cultural Archives. Johnson said he was pleased to support the development of the centre, \"which will house a wealth of historical material about the contribution of black people to British society. It will be a wonderful new cultural centre for London, but also for the UK, giving scholars a greater understanding of our country's rich heritage and inspiring people of all ages and communities.\" The mayor came under fire earlier this year for slashing funding for a series of high-profile multicultural events, including Black History Month and Africa Day. In a statement, his office said the BCA archive collection numbered over 10,000 historical archive documents, spanning five centuries, from letters and personal papers to periodicals, ephemera and photographs. \"This investment will help turn currently derelict Grade II Raleigh Hall in Windrush Square into a permanent home for BCA's wide-ranging collection of historical material relating to black Britain and the African diaspora,\" the statement said. Lambeth council will also provide \u00a3910,000 over five years, and has given the project a 99-year lease for Raleigh Hall, which will include a reference library for schools, students and the general public. Matthew Ryder, the chairman of the Black Cultural Archives, said: \"The movement of BCA to a permanent, purpose-built home, is itself an historic moment. We believe it will enable the BCA to become a global resource and a leading heritage site in London. It is a very exciting time and the support has been overwhelming.\" Councillor Steve Reed, the leader of Lambeth council, said black people would be able to \"come and explore their own history\" at the new centre, \"while people of other backgrounds will be able to come and celebrate the major contribution Britain's black communities have made to our national life and our shared culture\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
