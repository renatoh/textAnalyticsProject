But in a classic case of mistaken identity, our ABC has been mistaken for, well, their ABC, after Trump mistakenly tagged the Australian public broadcaster in a Tweet meant for the US commercial news network of the same name. \u201cFor the record, I didn\u2019t spend 30 hours with @abcnews, but rather a tiny fraction of that,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning Australian time. \u201cMore Fake News.\u201d The Australian ABC replied with a gif and quick \u201cG\u2019day!\u201d while ABC news director Gaven Morris said he hoped the Tweet would \u201cbrighten [Trump\u2019s] day\u201d. The ABC\u2019s social media coordinator, Gary Kemble, told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe often get confused with the US ABC on Twitter, but yes Trump\u2019s tweet has taken it to another level.\u201d Trump was intending to respond to a (US) ABC news special which aired on Sunday night in the states. In the interview, the president claimed former White House counsel Don McGahn \u201cmay have been confused\u201d when he told the Mueller investigation Trump instructed him multiple times to have the acting attorney general remove the special counsel because of perceived conflicts of interest. Trump also said he had been treated worse than any US president, including Abraham Lincoln, who was shot and killed, and became visibly upset when an aide coughed during an interview. While Twitter, of course, responded the way Twitter responds to these things: The 45th US president has a long track record of finger slips on his favourite social media platform. Only last week, a presidential typo made it seem Trump was suggesting he\u2019d met a royal marine mammal on his trip to the UK when he Tweeted that he\u2019d met the \u201cPrince of Whales\u201d. Most famous, and most famously overegged, was his May 2017 effort: \u201cDespite the negative press covfefe\u201d, a declarative linguistic snafu of such peculiar force it prompted its own kind of cultural revelation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
