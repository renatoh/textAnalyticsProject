In comments made as part of an Observer article on the relationship between the two countries, MacShane said that in regular journeys to Germany he was struck by the amount of coverage of the war. His comments drew a robust response from the Germany ambassador to the UK, who said Britain was the only country in Europe with which Germany still had problems over the war and claimed that 'German schoolchildren in this country regularly get abused or beaten up'. 'There are two problems with Britain's relationship with Germany,' MacShane said. 'The first is that very few opinion formers or policymakers know modern Germany, read German or visit the country. The other is the pathological need of the isolationist press for enemies in Europe. Mind you, I think it is time the Germans themselves became less obsessed with Hitler and the Second World War. We are in a new century, but too many Brits and Germans are still living in the last one.' Thomas Matussek, the German ambassador, said he found the minister's remarks 'astonishing'. He added: 'If you are a country with a history like ours, which has wreaked so much tragedy upon the world, I think it's normal and the right thing to look very deeply into that history and try to draw the right conclusions from it. 'If he [MacShane] means that we constantly hark back in newspapers and caricatures and jokes about it, I would say the evidence is just to the contrary. If you just compare the quantity of newspapers, television and media attention to the Third Reich in Britain and in Germany, it's very easy to see the contrary is the case.' Commentators say both countries are obsessed with history. While Britons have watched endless repeats of the goose-stepping Basil Fawlty's 'Don't mention the war' routine in Fawlty Towers, in Germany the film Der Untergang (The Downfall), a controversial depiction of Hitler's final days, recently broke box office records. Matussek continued: 'Of course there is a film out, maybe two or three films, but compared to the serious and less serious and very superficial films about the Second World War in this country, I think Denis hasn't got his facts right. If he means that as an ambassador I am particularly sensitive that German schoolchildren in this country regularly get abused or beaten up, I think it's quite natural for a German ambassador to feel, 60 years after the war, that such things shouldn't happen.' However, MacShane said both the German and the British media were fixated on the past: 'I remain surprised reading German papers and magazines at how much at times almost obsessive attention is paid to Hitler and the Nazi era ... This is healthy to remind Germans of that period, but I wonder if it's not time for Britain and Germany to move into the new century.' He added: 'Germany is a bulwark of European democracy today. I wish our papers reflected that fact.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
