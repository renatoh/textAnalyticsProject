But it\u2019s not always as subtle and nuanced as that. They are a band for whom everything is, metaphorically speaking, turned up to 11: the bass is invariably grinding and distorted, Matt Bellamy\u2019s vocals tend to the mock-operatic, there are are a great deal of guitar solos that go widdly-woo, and a lot of complex, fiddly riffs that sound not unlike Bach\u2019s Toccata and Fugue. Their desire for grandiosity leads them to do things bands haven\u2019t done in decades. At one juncture, the audience is favoured with what sounds suspiciously like a lengthy bass solo \u2013 something unseen in polite society since the pre-punk 70s \u2013 at another, a guitar with two necks makes an appearance. The visuals match the musical bombast: the screen at the back of the stage shows vast hands with strings attached to them, as if the band playing in front of them are puppets being manipulated; inflatable balls, streamers and confetti rain down on the audience, fireworks shoot into the sky. There\u2019s something impressive about the sheer breadth of influences they pull into their musical orbit \u2013 over the course of their set, you catch hints of everything from the galloping basslines of Iron Maiden\u2019s Phantom of the Opera to Giorgio Moroderish electronic disco to bovver-booted glam stomp \u2013 and if there\u2019s not exactly a great deal in the way of dynamic variety, they\u2019re at their best when they furnish all the bluster and grandiloquence with choruses as vast as their ambitions: the lyrics of Supermassive Black Hole make it an unlikely candidate for a mass audience singalong \u2013 \u201cglaciers melting in the dead of night and superstars sucked into the supermassive\u201d \u2013 but it becomes one nonetheless. At their least appealing, you\u2019re struck by the creeping fear that all the stuff in the lyrics and on the screens about the New World Order and survivialism might not be entirely tongue-in-cheek \u2013 \u201cNo one\u2019s going to take me alive, the time has come to make things right, you and I must fight for our rights,\u201d bellows the chorus of Knights of Cydonia \u2013 and Muse start to bear a faintly dispiriting resemblance to Queen, had Freddie Mercury avidly consumed the collected works of David Icke. But there are other moments when it seems both knowingly preposterous and preposterously entertaining, the work of a band who\u2019ve clearly been playing to audiences this huge for years, and have come to the conclusion that more is more. Singing along, letting off flares, the crowd seem to agree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
