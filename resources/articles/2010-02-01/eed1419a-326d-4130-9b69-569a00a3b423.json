Police announced they were launching a murder inquiry this morning after a mother and daughter were found dead in their suburban home in the north-west of Oswestry, in Shropshire, A few hours later a man's body was discovered and police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. West Mercia police tonight confirmed the names of the three dead people as Hugh, Susan and Francesca McFall. Post-mortem examinations will take place over the weekend to establish the cause of death. Hugh McFall's body was found at an industrial unit in St Martins, about four miles north of Oswestry. Craig Jones, a mechanic who works in the unit next door, said McFall used the unit as a base for his business, selling flowers to local supermarkets. \"As I drove into work this morning at about 8.40am two police cars followed me in. I thought they were following me but they went next door. I think they kicked the door down, then they came round and told us we'd have to lock up. Now there are about four police cars here \u2026 I heard they found Hugh's body inside, and his truck is parked down the road.\" Detective Inspector Mick Homden said: \"I can confirm that officers discovered the body of a man at a location in the Oswestry area shortly after 9.30am today. As a result the police at this moment in time are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.\" Speaking earlier, Detective Superintendent Sheila Thornes said the deaths were being treated as murder and more than 40 officers were investigating. A West Midlands ambulance service spokesman said: \"We were called to the address just before 5.20am today. After about an hour at the scene we were stood down by police.\" John Ellery, the local coroner, has been informed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
