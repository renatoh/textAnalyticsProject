Jeremy Corbyn has said affected women could receive up to \u00a331,300 in compensation, depending on their age. Boris Johnson, who previously pledged to consider the impact of the policy, now says he \u201ccannot promise I can magic up that money\u201d. The Liberal Democrats have committed to providing some compensation but offered no detailed plan or costings. Jenny Hughes has voted Conservative all her life but she will never do so again, she said. \u201cI did the right things all my life, financially, but am now forced to do gardening to keep my head above water, despite my hands being riddled with arthritis. I feel the Conservatives see us 1950s women just as a burden on society, no matter how much we have put in historically.\u201d She added: \u201cWe have been robbed, ridiculed and our plight ignored by the Conservatives. I now feel guilty and ignorant for having voted for them so long, and guilty that in doing so I thought only of myself and my own status. I will never vote Conservative again.\u201d Gill Wareing works as a civil servant and says she voted Conservative for many years but now feels very let down by them. She has had to sell her house and is now living in a caravan because of the pensions debacle. \u201cBefore Boris became prime minister he stated that he would do what he could to help us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow he says there is no money for us.\u201d Trish Vincent will also abandon a lifelong loyalty to the Tories over the issue. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ve voted Conservative since I was able to. Boris said he would look at our campaign but once again has let us down. \u201cI don\u2019t like Corbyn but leaders come and go,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can believe in Labour, then \u00a331,000 of the \u00a345,000 I\u2019m owed is evidently being given to me in compensation. I\u2019ve spent my entire life worrying about the country, Europe, my kids, the NHS. Now I have to be selfish and worry about me.\u201d Carol Lamb is one of the 1950s women worse hit by the pension changes. She is struggling to survive for the full six extra years without a state pension. \u201cI have always voted Conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am horrified at the injustice imposed by them on millions of women in a similar position to me. \u201cBoris Johnson initially said he might help us but has now changed his mind. In contrast, the Labour government has acknowledged the injustice and has come up with a plan to compensate us,\u201d she said. \u201cWho knows if it is an election ploy to get votes? But I will vote Labour on the strength of what they are offering.\u201d Denise Dickson has voted Conservative all her life but also won\u2019t be doing so again. \u201cHaving been a staunch and unwavering lifelong Conservative voter, I am absolutely appalled by the disdain and breathtaking arrogance to which we have been recently subjected to by the Conservative party,\u201d she said. \u201cIt both pains and shames me but having been cast aside and our plight trivialised and ignored by the current corrupt Conservative party I feel that I must vote Labour because it seemingly has my welfare and future at the heart of their proposals,\u201d she added. There are, however, lifelong Labour voters who will be abandoning Labour at the polls despite their offer. Julie Davenport was a Labour member but says she will vote Conservative for the first time at the election. \u201cLabour will borrow the money and my son and his children will pay for it. We\u2019ve already ruined the planet and left them a massive debt to inherit. And since Momentum joined Labour, I find it a hostile party for moderates.\u201d Labour\u2019s pension offer will not persuade Davenport back to the party either because, she said. \u201cThe women who most need this money, who have to use food banks and can\u2019t afford housing, heating and so on, will not see any of their compensation because the money given will be taken off of their benefits.\u201d Other women born in the fifties will, they say, vote Conservative despite Labour\u2019s offer and Johnson\u2019s U-turn. Judith Hilton would receive \u00a323,200 in compensation before tax under Labour\u2019s offer but will use the election to vote against it. \u201cI feel strongly that we should be repaid but I would rather repayment came from the court case and appeal brought by Backto60 than a blatant vote-buying pledge from Labour to partially compensate us to be paid for by even more government borrowing,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in the long-term, far-left socialist policies will greatly endanger the national economy and we will all end up worse off.\u201d Margaret Cooper, a lifelong Tory voter, agreed. \u201cThe Labour offer sounds very interesting. However, I don\u2019t trust their politics on the economy and I don\u2019t like Momentum. I\u2019ll be voting for the Conservative party again because although I want my pension, I think the Conservative party are being honest about not being able to pay it back, at least not over five years.\u201d But other 1950s women are so disillusioned by their experiences that, for the first time, they say they are unlikely to vote at all. Primrose Jones said: \u201cI never felt so conflicted about who to vote for to point I may not vote as there is no party I want to see in power.\u201dHaving voted Conservative in the past, she \u201chates what the Conservatives have done, and are doing to the less fortunate or well-off in society\u201d. But she has doubts about Labour. \u201cLabour seem the better bet for general care and welfare across society but they are a scary prospect. I am not sure I trust them on the economy. A different leader to Corbyn might make me feel differently. \u201cIn my constituency so it boils down to Conservatives versus Labour,\u201d Jones added. \u201cAnd I am beginning to think of not voting at all as there is no lesser of two evils.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
