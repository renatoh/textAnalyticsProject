Kompany departed last summer, San\u00e9 is soon to join Bayern Munich and Silva will end a decade at City at the close of this season. Fernandinho and Ag\u00fcero could sign new deals but their ages \u2013 35 and 32 respectively \u2013 also mean Guardiola has to look for replacements. The manager was asked whether a rebuild was needed. \u201cYes \u2013 not for the lack of quality but for the absence of Vinny, David; Dinho and Sergio have one year left \u2013 I don\u2019t know if they will extend or not,\u201d he said. \u201cSome players have to be replaced. But it\u2019s not a disaster or bad thing, it\u2019s part of football. \u201cIt happens in other clubs \u2013 players who are considered important players for the club decide to leave. [Also] they don\u2019t want to be here and that was the case for Jadon Sancho [now at Borussia Dortmund] and Leroy. \u201cWe cannot do anything else, as a club. If guys don\u2019t want to stay they have to leave; we are not getting the best of these players if in their mind they are not happy here. This is the first thing and the second is with the age. But it happened and we have to rebuild it \u2026 you never can be eternal, and we have to accept it and try to take the right decisions as a club to try to maintain the level that we have.\u201d Bayern Munich\u2019s David Alaba is thought to be of interest to Guardiola because of the 28-year-old\u2019s ability to play at left-back and in central defence, two areas he wants to strengthen. Kalidou Koulibaly, Napoli\u2019s 29-year-old central defender, is also on the manager\u2019s radar. He ruled out a return for Sancho. On Thursday City host Liverpool, whose manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, does not buy into the argument that Guardiola\u2019s team could be weakened next season. Reflecting on the loss of Silva, he said: \u201cBernardo Silva or [Phil] Foden, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan can go in that role as well. They don\u2019t lose players, they replace players. A lot of world-class players are still there. \u201cIf Ag\u00fcero gets older then Gabriel Jesus is there. They will not stop. Why should they stop? I\u2019m very positive about my team, I couldn\u2019t be more positive, but I cannot deny they are really good and we still want to beat them. \u201cI don\u2019t see any end of any era but what is an era? Maybe an era is just a word from the past and it\u2019s not possible any more. When we won the title the next day people told me we are only a big team if we win it twice or three times or four times. Sorry? Can we at least think for five minutes that we won it one time, which is not too bad because we tried it long enough? That\u2019s the world. I get that 100%. When a new season starts we try to show we want to be in contention again. I cannot see the end of anything for Man City.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
