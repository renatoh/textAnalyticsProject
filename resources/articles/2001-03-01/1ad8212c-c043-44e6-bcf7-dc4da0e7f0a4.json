There were eight investigations against Mr Vaz that Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, was unable to complete. They were: \u0095 Mr Vaz allegedly offered to help Jaffer Kapasi, a Leicester businessman, obtain planning permission for a mosque, in return for a \u00a3500 payment in 1991-92. \u0095 Mr Vaz is said to have received three more payments from Mr Kapasi between 1992 and 1996 for further help on land deals. \u0095 Mr Vaz is also accused of soliciting \u00a3500 from three religious groups to buy land at cheap prices from Leicester city council. Mr Vaz's response: Emphatically denied all the allegations. Claimed malice. The evidence: Mr Kapasi told four journalists about the allegations, corroborated by Sir Peter Soulsby, former leader of Leicester council. Mr Kapasi at first refused to talk to Mrs Filkin but when summoned to the committee retracted everything under oath. Mr Kapasi's solicitor, Mark Stephens, accused Mrs Filkin of a \"conflict of interest\" because she once served on the audit commission with Sir Peter Soulsby, but thsi objections was described as \"absurd\" by the committee. The committee's verdict: Could not uphold complaint because it was unsafe to rely on what Mr Kapasi said to journalists and there was no hard evidence that payments were received by Mr Vaz. \u0095 Mr Vaz allegedly received cheques as Labour party donations - including one for \u00a31,000 - from Leicester businessman Bakshish Attwal. Mr Vaz's response: Denied he had received the \u00a31,000 cheque. Said Mr Attwal had \"a lapse of memory\" because he was elderly. The evidence: Mr Attwal had a stub for a cheque payable to Keith Vaz on December 31 1992, marked donation to the Labour party. Mr Attwal said he remembered paying the cheque to Mr Vaz's mother. Mr Vaz said that this had not hap pened and cheque had been collected by John Thomas, secretary of Leicester East Labour party. The commissioner asked for evidence from bank statements. Mr Vaz said he no longer hadbank statements for January 1993 and nor could his bank provide copies. The constituency Labour party refused Mrs Filkin permission to look at its bank statements and then said it had lost its records. The committee's verdict: Complaint not upheld because of lack of evidence. \u0095 Mr Vaz was alleged to have received \u00a38 a month for four years from Mustapha Kamal and other Leicester councillors. Mr Vaz's response: Denied it. The evidence: Payments were made by standing order to Leicester East Labour party. The committee's verdict: Complaint not upheld because the money was too small to be worth pursuing. \u0095 The 50 Club, a constituency fundraising club said to be run by Mr Vaz, had allegedly secret accounts. Mr Vaz's response: Denied it. The evidence: Club appeared to be run by the constituency party rather than Mr Vaz. The committee's verdict : Complaint not upheld because it was satisfied that party ran the club and the sums involved were too small to warrant further inquiries. \u0095 Mr Vaz failed to dislcose a Leicester property in the register of MPs' interests. Mr Vaz's response: At first he accused the commissioner of getting the wrong address. Then he admitted it and agreed to register it. The evidence: The property was found to be Mr Vaz's constituency office. The committee's verdict: Rectification of register entry. \u0095 Mr Vaz was said to have used a family company, Mapesbury Communications, to support his parliamentary office without disclosing the sources of the company's income. Mr Vaz's response: Denied he received any money and said he knew nothing about the company's affairs. The evidence: The company is run by his wife, Maria Fernandes, the sole shareholder. His mother is a director and it is registered at one of Mr Vaz's homes. Ms Fernandes refused to supply the full accounts of the company to the commissioner or the committee. Instead she sent a list of people who had been paid or had received more than \u00a31,000 from the company. The committee's verdict: Information which was supplied did not lead it to uphold the complaint.
