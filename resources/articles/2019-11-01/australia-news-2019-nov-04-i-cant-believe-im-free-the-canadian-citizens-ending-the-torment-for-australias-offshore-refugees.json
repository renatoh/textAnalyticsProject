He has found a Starbucks coffee and a phone plan, but is yet to see the outside of his new home country. He is excited, exhausted and (repeatedly) expressing his disbelief at being there and not in Papua New Guinea, in detention, sick and distressed, punished for seeking asylum. The 27-year-old Iranian was sent to PNG\u2019s Manus Island after he sought asylum in Australia by boat. He has spent six, nearly seven years in offshore detention under Australia\u2019s infamously harsh refugee policies. Amid tens of thousands of people attempting a similar boat journey, sometimes fatally, in 2013 Australia declared that no sea-travelling refugee would ever settle in the country, and instead sent them to neighbouring tropical nations for \u201cprocessing\u201d. Years later, after a lifetime of illness and riots and beatings and deaths, Canada has taken him in under a private refugee sponsorship program which has few parallels in the world. It\u2019s late on a Thursday evening in Toronto when Sahragard is greeted by several of his sponsors, who he has never met, as well as two cousins he barely knows, and a best friend from Manus he hasn\u2019t seen in two years. They\u2019re all waving Canadian flags. Sahragardsays he became very sick \u2013 mentally and physically \u2013 on Manus and was transferred to Port Moresby for treatment, before being medically evacuated to Brisbane. Two weeks ago the long process of sponsorship was finalised and he left the Queensland city for Canada. He lost a lot of weight and a former Rohingya refugee, Jaivet Ealom, says his friend is barely recognisable. \u201cIt was so surreal. I was literally just telling him, who would have thought this could\u2019ve happened four years ago when we were sharing a cell on Manus,\u201d he says. Ealom has been in Canada for two years, which he says was better than he was expecting \u201cin every possible way\u201d. Ealom now works for a startup NGO and is a high-level activist for the Rohingya community. He\u2019s also studying and deferred an exam to come and meet Sahragard. Guardian Australia asks Ealom what he told his friend in preparation for arriving in Canada. He doesn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cPrepare to be free and prepare to be human again. To be called not by a number but by your name.\u201d Sahragard is the first of two Manus Island refugees to arrive this week. Refugee organisations and prospective sponsors are working on another 18 applications and have their sights on the hundreds of others still stuck in Australia\u2019s regime and who can\u2019t access US resettlement. Canadian man Stephen Watt has sponsored or assisted in the sponsorship of 40 to 50 people under the program, including Sahragard. The Canadian government requires at least five people to sponsor a refugee, and they must raise CAD$16,500 ($18,000). \u201cI guess how I got involved with this is I found out about Manus from a friend who lives in Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cAny five people who feel engaged can bring someone to Canada. It\u2019s like if you were watching someone on the news and saying \u2018this makes me feel hopeless\u2019, you can actually take that person out of the horrible situation and bring them to Canada.\u201d Local refugee groups have recently teamed up with the US-based Australian Diaspora Steps Up organisation, known as Ads-Up, to connect supportive Canadians with refugees needing a new home. Ads-Up USA was founded to support Manus and Nauru refugees arriving under the US-Australian refugee deal. \u201cWhatever you think of the politics, the status quo is bad for everyone \u2013 taxpayers are wasting billions to warehouse people, the government is dragging Australia\u2019s reputation through the mud, and people who fled persecution for being gay or Christian or for standing against dictatorships are having their lives destroyed,\u201d co-founder Ben Winsor says. \u201cIf the government won\u2019t make it right, we will.\u201d Watt is now heading up Ads-Up Canada along with Laura Beth Bugg, an Australian-Canadian professor at the University of Toronto. It has taken more than a year to get Sahragard to Canada, and Watt has spoken to him multiple times a day. In that time the situation in PNG has changed dramatically, with hundreds resettled in the US and almost everyone else moved to Port Moresby or medically evacuated to Australia. More than 50 men were also recently arrested and detained in the Bomana detention centre and cut off from outside contact and lawyers. \u201cThere have been a lot of texts and anxieties about being put in Bomana,\u201d says Watt. \u201cI was [going through it with him] for the ups and downs and the transportation to Port Moresby and the medevac to Australia \u2026 It\u2019s wonderful to be here and see him and see there are no fears of ever being put in Bomana.\u201d For Sahragard and Ealom, the knowledge that many of their friends remain in PNG or under temporary transfer in Australia, is distressing. \u201cThey are like family to me,\u201d says Sahragard. \u201cI can\u2019t say how I feel about it \u2026 I haven\u2019t spoken with anyone since I left.\u201d Ealom says he can\u2019t help but feel guilt sometimes. A few days later, Guardian Australia speaks to Sahragard again. He\u2019s in his new house, living with an Iranian refugee couple who hosted a home-cooked meal on Friday. He\u2019s still happy, but there are other feelings in the mix. \u201cI had Persian food after six years; it was really great. I couldn\u2019t eat much or really enjoy it though,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect myself to not enjoy it. It was really good but I still have stress and anxiety and stomach pain, which I\u2019ve had for a long time. \u201cI still have lots of nightmares, I can\u2019t sleep, I have panic, I feel numb. Sometimes I think, what can I do, what if I can\u2019t deal with my mental problems, or everything that happened to me? \u201cThese are the things that I think about a lot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
