The government has to agree an initial contract for the submarines' design as early as September \u2013 when parliament is not sitting \u2013 but though the policy has not yet been discussed in cabinet, a senior Labour source said a 10% spending cut in Whitehall budgets would require the defence policy in its current \"inflated\" form to be revisited. A rethink on Trident before the autumn party conference is also being floated as a sop to those MPs who might consider moving against the prime minister. The decision to upgrade Trident was unpopular on the Labour backbenches and led to the last significant rebellion of Tony Blair's premiership when it was voted through parliament in 2006. But a source close to the process of compiling Labour's next manifesto, which would have to include a change in government position should a U-turn on Trident be performed, said any rethink before an election was \"extremely unlikely\". The source said: \"If there was any U-turn on Trident it would be likely to feature heavily in any election campaign and I really don't think the Labour party want to fight the next election on a defence issue. \"There could be a strategic review by the Ministry of Defence, but I'd expect that to be after any election, not before.\" Blocking off the possibility of a rethink could divide the party at an inopportune time, less than 11 months before the last possible date of a general election. One senior Labour source said it should be on the table as a potential area for cost-cutting. \"We are going to have to face up to the fact, largely on the grounds of cost, that the policy for a replacement of Trident in its current form is an inflated policy,\" the Labour source said. \"What we will need to look for is an independent deterrent without the expense. But these discussions are happening right now on a very tentative basis.\" These early discussions on the feasibility of Trident are echoed within the military as the Ministry of Defence faces the prospect of its budgets falling by 10%. A the MoD said that its spending plans would be affected by public spending constraints, but added: \"The government, in agreement with parliament, chose to ensure that the cornerstone of the UK's security policy is maintained through our independent nuclear deterrent. We believe that the investment in a capability of such vital importance is one that as a nation we can and should afford.\" The government has cast the policy as relatively inexpensive at \u00a320bn \u2013 less than 2% of the defence budget. But defence officials have put the total cost of maintaining the system over 25 years at more than \u00a370bn. One idea gaining currency among independent analysts and government officials is that a future government would still commission the four nuclear submarines and save money by extending the life of the current nuclear warheads."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
