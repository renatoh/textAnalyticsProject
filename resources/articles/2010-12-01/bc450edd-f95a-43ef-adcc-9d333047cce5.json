Following a meeting with Irish regulators a few days after the government stepped in to guarantee all deposits in Irish banks at the end of September 2008, Washington's economic adviser in the Dublin embassy warned that Ireland may be \"a bit optimistic\" about the financial sector's prospects. A splurge of lending to property companies before the credit crunch has left Ireland's banks on their knees and forced Dublin to accept a \u20ac85bn (\u00a372bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund and its European Union partners. The embattled government has forced through austerity measures to cut \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) from the Irish budget deficit in the next three years to appease its rescuers. Some \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) had been ploughed into Ireland's financial system even before the IMF-EU rescue package, which provided up to another \u20ac30bn to prop up the banks. Even so, in early October 2008 Irish officials were insisting to the US embassy that they did not foresee any need for a government bailout of the banks and blamed \"herd mentality\" based on \"rumour and innuendo\" for creating the need for the blanket guarantee of deposits. The US economic adviser was left wondering whether Dublin had a grip on the crisis after the meeting with officials from the central bank of Ireland and the regulator. Remarks by one of the regulatory officials, Billy Clarke, are recorded in the cable. \"Explaining the seemingly sudden pressure on Irish banks last week, he said a 'perfect storm' of external events related to the credit crisis had dried up the traditional sources of financing for financial institutions,\" the cable said. \"[Gordon] Barham maintained that the level of impaired assets in the system stood at between 0.5 and 0.8% and these are mostly confined to loans to commercial property developers. When pressed, Barham said the media had exaggerated the level of problem assets and those that existed could be managed.\" Kevin Cardiff, secretary general at Ireland's department of finance, echoed the regulator's views. \"[Cardiff] pointed out that auditors contracted by his department to look at the books of at least two of the institutions under pressure came away with a 'favourable impression of the loan books',\" the cable said. \"While he admitted that the amount of 'speculative loans or those that are not currently product is not insignificant', he stressed that all involved in putting together the package were confident that government would not be forced to bail out the banks.\" Cardiff had added: \"The genesis of this [the deposit guarantee] was classic 'herd mentality' based mostly on rumour and innuendo about Irish banks rather than any hard facts.\" The US adviser concludes that the Irish authorities will have their \"work cut out\" to rebuild the financial sector. \"Against the background of the steep slump in the property market and anecdotal evidence we have picked up, it may be that government officials are being a bit optimistic in their assessment of the level impaired assets. It begs the question: if the level of impaired assets is not a problem, why the sudden pressure on Irish banks?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
