Confused by the bewildering political menu on offer, Poles might also be forgiven for thinking that they are seeing double. The ubiquitous posters of the plump, grey-haired chap demanding to be made prime minister later this month are (almost) indistinguishable from those of the plump, grey-haired bloke urging he be made president. The reason is not that some megalomaniac is after both jobs. Rather, the most redoubtable double act in European politics is going for a double whammy. The Kaczynski brothers - Lech and Jaroslaw, identical twins, former child film stars and veterans of Solidarity - are determined to keep Polish politics a family affair If they succeed - both are running second in the opinion polls at the moment - the impact could be mind-boggling. Is that President Lech Kaczynski sitting at the top table at the EU banquet in Brussels? Or is Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski standing in for him at alternate sessions? Who can tell? The 56-year-old siblings were born 45 minutes apart. Polish cognoscenti say that the only way to tell your Lech from your Jaroslaw is to have a good look at the faces. Lech, the younger and the current mayor of Warsaw who wants to be president, has a mole, unlike Jaroslaw, leader of the conservative Law and Justice party who hopes to be next rime minister. Until a few weeks ago, the twins appeared well-placed to take over Poland. And they can still expect to remain a formidable force in a country that is swinging decisively their way - to the right. But if current polling is to be believed, Lech is currently more than 20 points behind the presidential frontrunner, Donald Tusk, a liberal conservative, while Jaroslaw's party is also trailing Tusk's Civic Platform party by 13 points in the parliamentary contest. The twins share robust conservative views, keep their own counsel and have a reputation for being paranoid and unruly. They are proudly Polish and Catholic. They like law and order. They don't like gays, abortion, Russians or Germans, communists, football hooligans, or corrupt businessmen and politicians. Fortunately for them, much of that palette coincides with the sentiments and prejudices of many Poles. Getting tough on loutish behaviour is another favourite and popular position. Warsaw this week has been shaken by football hooliganism and rioters. The Kaczynskis want 24-hour courts meting out prompt punishment. By far the biggest of the new 10 countries joining the EU in last year's big-bang expansion, Poland quickly won itself a reputation for being querulous. That image will be reinforced if the Kaczynskis take over. They thrive on stirring up trouble. While deeply conservative on moral and cultural matters, the twins, however, are far from rightwing when it comes to money, business, and the economy. Unlike Tusk and their future coalition partners, the twins are anti-privatisation, want a proper state health service and are against the current fashion for flat taxes now making headlines in Germany. Culturally conservative while socially welfarist, they are, in short, an interesting pair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
