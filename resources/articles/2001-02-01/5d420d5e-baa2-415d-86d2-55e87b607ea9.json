Nearby the manager would open a rival stall, proudly offering jerseys declaring \"I was there when the defence was breached\". A choice of design and colour would be out of the question. With Graham just now everything is tight and unattractive. In drawing positives from this fourth successive goalless stalemate Graham was in a minority. Sure, Spurs are becoming harder to beat but such performances, devoid of quality and imagination, could scarcely be further from what their supporters want. Three shots on targets was the sum of Tottenham's efforts and they have now failed to score in seven of their past eight Premiership matches. Graham's complaint that he is without three experienced strikers masks deeper problems. Spurs' creativity and quality of crossing were so awful that it is hard to see what difference a fit Les Ferdinand would have made. Poor Sergei Rebrov, the one player capable of producing something truly unexpected, has been swallowed up by the ordinariness of it all. \"We could do with a bit of magic from him,\" Graham said, and he could do with Stephen Carr returning from injury as well. In Carr's absence, only the substitute Matthew Etherington looked capable of beating a marker and stretching Charlton's resolute defence. Graham will not be concerned by the booing on the whistle nor the chants of \"We want Graham out\" but he ought to be worried by the thought of losing at Charlton in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday. That would as good as end Tottenham's season and surely make it more difficult for the prospective owners Enic to persuade Sol Campbell and others to stay. \"It could be a draw,\" Graham said of Wednesday, which was hardly like predicting the night's lottery numbers. Sven-Goran Eriksson, who suffered through this game, will presumably not be rushing to the Valley. Charlton's manager Alan Curbishley pressed the England claims of Richard Rufus afterwards but the game's most impressive touch and movement came from a Dane, Claus Jensen. Spurs' most accomplished passer, Darren Anderton, was peripheral at right wing-back and they showed a hint of fluency only after Tim Sherwood came on. \"Their confidence is very low,\" said Charlton's Matt Svensson. \"You can see that with every player.\" Graham hopes the solidity at the back will foster more belief coming forward but he could do with a few strikes from his midfielders. Between them they have seven goals from open play, and on Wednesday with Andy Booth cup-tied graham may use only one striker. The Scot plans to make signings once the takeover is completed this month and has to hope Enic will back him. Curbishley, meanwhile, goes on overachieving on more modest resources. For all Spurs' talk of injuries, Charlton arrived without their captain, goalkeeper and four strikers. Easily the brighter in the first half, they should have scored in the second but Shaun Bartlett drew a rare save out of Neil Sullivan. Spurs wasted two late chances, so Graham equalled the four successive nil-nils he achieved with Arsenal in 1993. Tottenham fans knew he had been there and done that but they did not want the T-shirt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
