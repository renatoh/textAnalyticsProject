Inter took over from Chievo at the head of the standings after the Verona side's match against Lazio was postponed due to a frozen pitch. Champions AS Roma missed out on a chance to go top as they were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Brescia. Christian Vieri put Inter ahead with a composed finish in the 18th minute, but the second half belonged to Ronaldo. Five minutes after the restart, the Brazilian rose at the back post to head Sergio Conceicao's cross powerfully into the net to double Inter's lead, and three minutes later the former Barcelona striker produced a goal reminiscent of his glory days. Argentine Andres Guglielminpietro sent him clear with a neat pass, and Ronaldo raced goalwards before neatly rounding Verona goalkeeper Fabrizio Ferron and coolly slotting the ball into the net. The last time Ronaldo scored two goals in a game was on May 3 1999 in Inter's 5-4 win at Roma. \"I am very satisfied, there is no doubt about that,\" a grinning Ronaldo told Tele Piu television. \"I am really delighted to be back among the goals and I hope there are more to come.\" Asked about last season, in which he did not play a single game after his second knee operation inside six months, Ronaldo admitted it had been tough. \"It was difficult to get over the psychological trauma but I did it with the help of the team and the coach,\" he said. \"[Inter coach Hector] Cuper brought me back step by step and that helped to rebuild my faith. Then he gave me a chance in the starting line-up. \"But this is not the end of things because I have to improve further. I feel fine now but I want to reach even better form,\" the Brazilian added. Roma began the day level on points with Chievo at the top of the table but showed little evidence of their league position in a dull goalless draw with Brescia. Juventus also had a frustrating afternoon as they were held at Fiorentina. French striker David Trezeguet put Juve ahead in the 57th minute, latching on to a dreadful back-pass from Nuno Gomes before rounding Fiorentina keeper Alex Manninger and slotting home his ninth goal of the season. Portugal striker Gomes made amends for his error, however, by grabbing a close-range equaliser 11 minutes from time to leave Juventus six points behind the leaders. It was also a bad day for AC Milan, whose captain Paolo Maldini was stretchered off with a knee injury 25 minutes into their game at Bergamo. Maldini faced x-ray scans amid fears he may have suffered ligament damage. Six minutes after Maldini's departure Atalanta took the lead through former Milan defender Luigi Sala, but Carlo Ancelotti's side salvaged a point through a scrambled goal from Andriy Shevchenko in the 58th minute. New Parma coach Gedeone Carmignani was unable to reverse his team's poor form under Argentine coach Passarella as they went down to a Marco Ferrante goal at Torino. But Udinese coach Giampiero Ventura picked up his first win since taking over from Roy Hodgson with a 1-0 win at Bologna thanks to a strike from in-form Danish midfielder Martin Jorgensen. There were plenty of goals in games involving teams at the foot of the table, with Perugia winning 3-2 at Lecce and Piacenza coming out on top in a five-goal thriller at bottom-club Venezia thanks to two goals from Paolo Poggi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
