Now, with the release by MI5 of secret documents dealing with the Burgess and Maclean scandal, there is a new perspective on the betrayal that enthralled a generation. Two biographies of Burgess and a forthcoming account of Maclean (Orphan: The Lives of Donald Maclean by Roland Philipps) are just the latest manifestations of 1950s spy-mania. From thrillers and biographies to Alan Bennett\u2019s television drama An Englishman Abroad, the \u201cmissing diplomats\u201d (it was several weeks before their treachery as Soviet spies was confirmed) have inspired thousands of column inches. The awesome scale of Russian penetration became a national obsession. In government, there was disbelief; among the reading public, fascination. Throughout the 1950s, the top newspaper story from Moscow was less to do with Stalin or Khrushchev than Burgess and Maclean, who became a strange kind of national brand as familiar to British readers as Fortnum &amp; Mason or Gilbert and Sullivan. For the defectors, their new life in the Soviet Union was both Yeomen of the Guard and Pirates of Penzance. Burgess was as worldly, reckless and compelling as his co-conspirator was stiff, ideological and forbidding. Where Maclean made a new career as \u201cMark Frazer\u201d, instructing Soviet diplomats and avoiding British journalists, Burgess remained himself, a charming and erratic high-living homosexual, who continued to cruise and booze with Rabelaisian joie de vivre. The sensational irruption of Guy Burgess, either on the telephone or in person, became a bizarre rite of passage for the English visitor to Soviet Moscow. On his first meeting with Michael Redgrave, who was playing in Hamlet with a touring Shakespeare company, Burgess was so drunk he threw up in the star\u2019s dressing room, a story that would eventually attract Bennett\u2019s attention. Not everyone was enchanted by Burgess: Edward Crankshaw, for instance, was typical of the 1950s Observer. Like David Astor, his editor, he had done secret work in the second world war, serving in Moscow and then at Bletchley Park. Astor, who often hired journalists with wartime intelligence connections, brought Crankshaw on to his staff in 1947 to specialise in Soviet Russia. As an Observer recruit, Crankshaw had even been summoned by Burgess, in his Foreign Office guise, for a dressing-down for being \u201ctoo soft towards Russia\u201d. It was Crankshaw\u2019s first meeting with Burgess and he was not impressed. But he was no ordinary journalist. Steeped in Russia, Crankshaw seems always to have mixed reportage with espionage, attracting the attention of both the CIA and the KGB. In a world of nods and winks across Whitehall and St James\u2019s, the line between the fourth estate and the defence of the realm was indistinct. An extraordinary amount of British journalism was still conducted in London\u2019s clubland, where the spirit of John Buchan\u2019s Richard Hannay ultimately morphed into John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s George Smiley. Astor\u2019s team of mavericks achieved some astounding foreign scoops. In June 1956, for instance, during the regular editorial lunch at the Waldorf Hotel, Crankshaw, not revealing his source, mentioned that he had acquired a transcript of Khrushchev\u2019s secret denunciation of Stalin to the 20th Communist party congress. The 26,000-word extract in the Observer of 11 June 1956 not only caused a newspaper sensation, it also consolidated Crankshaw\u2019s reputation as the pre-eminent British press authority on Soviet affairs. Soon afterwards, in the winter of 1958, Crankshaw found himself lured into Burgess\u2019s orbit once more. He had just landed in Moscow, a city he knew well, to conduct an Observer investigation into Khrushchev\u2019s Russia. A cache of recently declassified MI5 files, uncovered by Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert in their research for Guy Burgess: The Spy Who Knew Everyone, paints a fascinating picture of Crankshaw\u2019s visit, and the twilight world of cold war journalism. The reporter even used the British embassy as a base, filed a 2,000-word memorandum on Burgess, and spoke to the ambassador, Sir Patrick Reilly, \u201cas a friend\u201d, an arrangement that neither side found peculiar. Burgess phoned Crankshaw within 24 hours of his arrival. \u201cThree long sessions\u201d in the spy\u2019s apartment at 53-55 Bolshaya Pirogovskaya ensued. Reilly, reporting back to London, described Crankshaw\u2019s version of these meetings as \u201cthe most interesting and perceptive report on Burgess that we have had\u201d. For reasons that remain obscure, Crankshaw told the ambassador that he did not intend to write anything about Burgess in the Observer. There was, it seems, a conflict in Crankshaw\u2019s mind between the thrill of the scoop, and some professional unease at his encounter with Burgess. On first meeting at his flat, Crankshaw, who had already sparred with Burgess over the phone, was unable to hide his loathing for the spy\u2019s treachery. They had exchanged \u201chard words, calling spades spades\u201d. But then, writes Crankshaw, \u201cI understood what I had failed to see before\u201d \u2013 Burgess\u2019s unmistakable charisma. In his \u201cworn Old Etonian tie\u201d and shabby Savile Row pinstripe, Burgess still exerted an extraordinary personal magnetism. Slowly, the reporter was won round. They would never agree on the USSR. Politics, said Crankshaw, \u201care not his best point\u201d. However, growing accustomed to \u201cthis strange atmosphere\u201d, the Observer man became dazzled by Burgess\u2019s \u201cbrilliance and charm\u201d. \u201cHe talked incessantly,\u201d writes Crankshaw, \u201cand with delight about Eton and Oxford and mutual friends.\u201d (Burgess was actually a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge.) \u201cI have never known anyone,\u201d Crankshaw declared, \u201cwho flaunted his homosexuality so openly,\u201d and he noted that Burgess\u2019s live-in boyfriend, \u201ca young factory mechanic who plays the concertina beautifully\u201d, was \u201cintelligent, unsqualid, and pleasant in a pansy sort of way\u201d. Burgess offered Crankshaw his normal drink, a lethal bloody mary mixed from equal slugs of vodka and tomato juice. At the lunch that followed, Crankshaw reported, \u201cwe drank five of these shockers as well as a good deal of chianti\u201d. Later in the afternoon, a drunken Burgess called Maclean to fix a meeting with Crankshaw. When Maclean refused to see the Observer, Burgess called him \u201ca stuffed shirt\u201d, admitting to Crankshaw that the two spies had \u201clittle in common\u201d. At a subsequent meeting, Burgess took his guest to the Novodevichy church to introduce him to \u201canother boyfriend\u201d, a priest, whom Crankshaw describes as \u201cyoungish and wholly repellent \u2013 very handsome in a horrible way \u2013 and corrupt to the ears. Burgess is obviously head over heels in love with this monster.\u201d By now the talk had moved to books and opera. Crankshaw undertook to track down rare English language recordings of Mozart in London for Burgess, who was homesick. He also promised to help fix Burgess\u2019s gramophone. A subsequent letter in which he told Burgess he had bought some \u201cnew cartridges for your pick-up\u201d was intercepted by MI5. Crankshaw seems to have found himself in a classic journalistic bind. The more complicit he became, the less dispassionate his reporting. \u201cBurgess,\u201d he writes, \u201clives a lonely life in considerable comfort at 5,000 roubles a month.\u201d The spy was confiding in him, as he did with every English visitor, that he wanted \u201cto go home to see his old mother\u201d, even though he dreaded \u201cthe uproar and the publicity\u201d and wondered if he would be arrested\u201d on his return. Crankshaw confessed in his memo: \u201cI liked him much and finished up being deeply sorry for him. The man is half dotty, not actively vicious. The whole situation is the sort of personal tragedy that can only be ended by death.\u201d Crankshaw would publish a series of long articles on the Soviet Union over the next three months, says Purvis, but never mentioned meeting Burgess. Pendennis, the Observer\u2019s diarist, was in Moscow at the same time, but Crankshaw\u2019s anecdotes did not feature there either. Only now, with the release of Foreign Office and MI5 Burgess files to the National Archives, can Crankshaw\u2019s exclusive report to the British authorities, and some intercepted correspondence about gramophone records, be read outside Whitehall. Guy Burgess died of acute liver failure, on 30 August 1963, aged 52. It is said that Kim Philby, who had recently defected to the USSR, paid a deathbed visit. Crankshaw retired to write history books, and died at home in Kent in November 1984. He wrote much about Russia, before and after the revolution, but he never returned to the subject of the Cambridge spies. Stewart Purvis, with Jeff Hulbert, is the author of Guy Burgess, the Spy Who Knew Everyone (Biteback Publishing)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
