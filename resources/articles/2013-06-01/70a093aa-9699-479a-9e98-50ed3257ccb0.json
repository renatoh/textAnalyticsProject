Thanks for reading and for your comments below. Erdogan has met members of a group opposed to the redevelopment of Gezi Istanbul, Reuters reports. The prime minister met the delegation, who included actors, artists and two members of theprotest group Taksim Solidarity, hours after saying his patience had run out and warning those occupying Gezi Park to leave. Erdogan will meet with members of a group opposed to the redevelopment of Gezi park later tonight in a bid to end the anti-government protests, Reuters reports. In an apparent u-turn, just hours after Erdogan said his patience with the protesters had run out, the prime minister will meet with the Taksim Solidarity group at the heart of the campaign to protect the park. \"Upon the prime minister's invitation, members of the Taksim Solidarity will discuss with him our view that Gezi Park should remain a park,\" Eyup Muhcu, head of the Chamber of Architects, told Reuters. Musicians and actors were also in the delegation to meet Erdogan in Ankara around 11pm (20.00 GMT), media reports said. I\u2019ve just been speaking to my colleague Peter Beaumont in Gezi Park. He said the mood among demonstrators was \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d \u2013 although they were expecting a police attack this evening. Peter said: I spoke to one 36-year-old woman, a child psychologist. She\u2019s come down, it\u2019s her first night in the park, with her husband. She\u2019s left her nine-year-old son behind, whose parting message was something along the lines of: \u201cMum, Erdogan\u2019s not going to listen. This is going to take a long time.\u201d On the other end of the age spectrum I was chatting to a retired bank worker and writer. Again this is going to be his first night here. His comment to me was again: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay, and Erdogan\u2019s idiotic if he thinks he can shift us.\u201d I asked Peter what the protesters were demonstrating against \u2013 was it just the threat to the park? There was a survey today that looked into the reasons for people being in Gezi Park, and the overwhelming majority of people in the park now are here to protest against Erdogan and against what the police have been doing in the last couple of weeks. He said he had spoken to a tour guide who said the protest was now about \u201cstanding up for what they feel are their rights, which are being trampled on at the moment\u201d. The referendum idea seemed to have gone by the wayside, I suggested. \u201cThat notion came from the deputy chairman of the AKP [H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik], and I\u2019m not sure how much political support it had above him,\u201d Peter said, \u201cand there isn\u2019t a great deal of support for the notion of a referendum here [in Gezi Park].\u201d Here is a summary of today\u2019s key events so far: \u2022 Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has told protesters to leave Gezi Park so the authorities can \u201cdeal with the fringe terrorist\u201d groups there. \u201cWe will clean Gezi Park of them,\u201d he tweeted. In a speech in Ankara at around the same time, Erdo\u011fan said: \u201cWe cannot allow lawbreakers to hang around freely in this square. We will clean the square.\u201d He said he was \u201cmaking his warning for the last time\u201d, after having given the protesters 24 hours to leave central Istanbul yesterday. He also hit out at the EU for passing a resolution expressing concern about the Turkish police\u2019s use of force, saying: \u201cWho do you think you are by taking such a decision?\u201d Police were pictured gathered around coaches behind the Atat\u00fcrk Cultural Centre (AKM) beside Taksim Square. \u2022 Protesters, who at present are in Gezi Park rather than Taksim Square, although they were in the square overnight, vowed to stand their ground. Filiz Avunduk, a 28-year-old arts professional, told the Guardian: \u201cWe asked for five basic things and until we get a response we won\u2019t be leaving here.\u201d Asked if she was worried for her safety, another protester, 31-year-old Asli Cavusoglu, told the Guardian: \u201cI think the fear threshold is long passed. Nobody is afraid.\u201d \u2022 The protests were sparked two weeks ago by plans to demolish Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall and a replica of an old military barracks, and have since snowballed into an unprecedented nationwide display of anger at Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian and Islamist style. But a proposal to damp down tensions by holding a referendum on the plans \u2013 mooted yesterday by deputy chairman of the ruling AKP party H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik \u2013 does not seem to have found favour with either Erdo\u011fan or the protesters. Zeynep Pinto, 28, an interior designer, told the New York Times: \u201cA referendum would be a step forward, and I think we could win. But we want more than the park now. We want change.\u201d \u2022 Twenty-six-year-old Ethem Sarisuluk, who had been on life support for days after being reportedly hit in the head by a tear-gas cannister, was pronounced dead, according to family lawyer Sema Aksoy. His death brings to five the number of people killed during the protests, including one policeman. Amnesty International has called the police violence in Istanbul \u201cunprecedented\u201d. \u201cPolice have been using tear gas as a punitive measure, rather than for crowd dispersal as it is intended,\u201d said Andrew Gardner, the group's Turkey researcher. \u201cThere have been cases where police are firing directly at protesters, causing serious head injuries.\u201d The Associated Press has more on the speech Erdogan made to his AKP party in Ankara. The prime minister said: This square belongs to the people of Istanbul, the people of the whole country, and to all international visitors. So we cannot allow lawbreakers to hang around freely in this square. We will clean the square. Erdogan also lashed out at the European parliament over its non-binding motion for a resolution that expressed its concern over \"the disproportionate and excessive use of force\" by Turkish police. He said: I won't recognize the decision that the European Union parliament is going to take about us ... Who do you think you are by taking such a decision? Also today, 26-year-old Ethem Sarisuluk, who had been on life support for days after being reportedly hit in the head by a tear-gas cannister, was pronounced dead, according to family lawyer Sema Aksoy. His death brings to five the number of people killed during the protests, including one policeman. Correction, 1.30pm: An earlier version of this post used the translation \"troublemakers\" rather than \"lawbreakers\". The Associated Press corrected its translation. Benjamin Harvey of Bloomberg News posts this picture showing police gathered around coaches behind the Atat\u00fcrk Cultural Centre (AKM) beside Taksim Square. You can see the building and the car park on this Google Map. In this video, protesters talk about why they are demonstrating in Gezi Park. One says: We really want to protect this area. We really want to tell something to [the] government and all over the country about freedom, about the park, about the green, about the trees. The video also includes the comments by H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik, deputy chairman of the AKP, suggesting a referendum. Protesters are sceptical: How can we trust him? We have been through this before. They even let dead people cast votes. How can we trust them? I have just been speaking to Filiz Avunduk, a 28-year-old arts professional who is protesting in Gezi Park. I told her about Erdogan\u2019s threat: \u201cI tell my sincere environmentalist brothers, please withdraw from there and leave us to deal with the fringe terrorist groups. We will clean Gezi Park of them.\u201d She responded: We actually don\u2019t separate ourselves from anyone who is here. Because for the first time I know \u2026 people from different backgrounds, from different religions, from different political views are gathered here because they have somehow been offended by the current government, in a way. So we don\u2019t separate ourselves here as them and us. If anyone is called terrorists, then we\u2019re terrorists as well. We\u2019re waiting here in peaceful protest \u2026 We asked for five basic things and until we get a response we won\u2019t be leaving here. These were that \u201cthe park stays as a park\u201d, that those arrested during the protests are freed, people are given the right to protest in public spaces around Turkey, the police are not allowed to use disproportionate force, and that the proposed \u201cThird Bridge\u201d in Istanbul is not built. She said the protesters were helping and supporting each other with food and shelter. More people had arrived in response to Erdogan\u2019s threat yesterday to end the protests within 24 hours \u2013 \u201cand we will stand ground\u201d. Was she worried there would be a repeat of the violent police raid of Tuesday night? Avunduk said various government figures constantly made \u201cconfusing statements\u201d, so \u201cwe always have that worry\u201d. Nobody leaves their gas masks or their glasses or headwear away. Everybody has that constantly, because everybody has the fear that it could happen at any time. Besides that, there is still an incredible solidarity happening and there is still an atmosphere of hope and waiting and standing ground solidly. Constanze Letsch translates that most recent tweet from Erdogan: Gezi Park is not a place for occupation. That is why I repeat my warning one more time. Mothers and fathers, take care of your children and take them out of there. Constanze Letsch sends these translations of some of Erdogan's tweets: The AKM (Ataturk Cultural Centre) was cleaned up, the statue was cleaned up. The police will continue doing their duty. This is a state of law and everybody has to stick to the rules. They burn municipal buses and then they pose in front of them. That cannot be called a struggle for freedom. I tell my sincere environmentalist brothers, please withdraw from there and leave us to deal with the fringe terrorist groups. We will clean Gezi Park of them. Here Erdogan warns the protesters to leave: Erdogan issued his warning at an AKP meeting in Ankara. Reuters quotes him as saying: Our patience is at an end. I am making my warning for the last time. I say to the mothers and fathers please take your children in hand and bring them out ... We cannot wait any more because Gezi Park does not belong to occupying forces but to the people. Erdogan has given a final warning to the protesters, ordering them to leave Gezi Park and saying his patience has run out, according to Reuters. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been sending out a barrage of tweets over the last hour. You can read them here. I have just asked my colleague Constanze Letsch to translate them. The Associated Press reports that the PM has said police will remove \"troublemakers\" from Istanbul's Taksim Square within 24 hours, repeating the warning he gave yesterday. Correction, 1.30pm: The Associated Press later corrected thisfrom \"troublemakers\" to \"lawbreakers\". More details soon ... Amnesty International has called the police violence in Istanbul \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Andrew Gardner, the group's Turkey researcher, told the Independent: Never has there been a time when police violence was this widespread and this sustained. It is unprecedented. Police have been using tear gas as a punitive measure, rather than for crowd dispersal as it is intended. There have been cases where police are firing directly at protesters, causing serious head injuries. They are also firing tear gas into buildings, which can be very dangerous. The violence we saw [on Tuesday] was a direct result of inflammatory statements made by him [Erdogan]. The New York Times has a quote from protester Zeynep Pinto, 28, an interior designer, which perhaps sums up the flaw in H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik's referendum plan: A referendum would be a step forward, and I think we could win. But we want more than the park now. We want change. If that view is widely shared among the protesters these demonstrations could end up representing a serious challenge to Erdo\u011fan. My colleague Constanze Letsch has just been down to Taksim Square and Gezi Park. She says the protesters, who gathered in Taksim Square again overnight, have now moved over to Gezi Park. She said there were hundreds of them there. But the square itself was back to normal again, she said, with traffic flowing through it. I\u2019ve just been speaking to Asli Cavusoglu, a 31-year-old visual artist from Istanbul who has taken part in the demonstrations over the past few days and was there again last night. I asked her what she thought of AKP deputy chairman H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik\u2019s plan for a referendum on the demolition and replacement of Gezi Park as a solution to the current unrest. I think this referendum idea is quite unacceptable, because we can\u2019t really vote for our basic rights. She asked rhetorically what the question would be: \u201cTo cut the trees?\u201d The issue was not just about Gezi Park any more, she said. There was also the issue of a cultural centre in Taksim Square which had been wrecked by the government inside rather restored. In addition she said the protesters\u2019 now had a broader set of concerns about Erdogan. She said Erdogan failed to take into account what the minority thought about issues. \u201cThis is what we call democracy. It doesn\u2019t mean that because the minority supports you you can do anything you want.\u201d Were the protesters worried by Erdogan\u2019s threat that \u201cthis issue will be over in 24 hours\u201d? Did they fear another violent police raid like Tuesday\u2019s? Yes. Everybody is aware of that and everybody knows the danger. And they [the authorities] can repeat the same brutal night as two days ago, but the park was very crowded yesterday, and there were two young men who played piano in the square. Nobody is leaving until he says he is stopping the Ottoman barracks project [to demolish Gezi Park]. Cavusoglu said she was going to go back to Taksim Square in an hour. Was she worried about her own safety? Yes, of course. We are all. And it\u2019s funny because I am now carrying a gas mask in my purse, and head protectors. Somehow it\u2019s become normal to go out with all this equipment. But we are aware of it. I think the fear threshold is long passed. Nobody is afraid. Here is footage of German pianist Davide Martello playing in Taksim Square last night. He has promised to play again tonight at 7pm. Martello said he had been playing \u201cfor freedom and our rights\u201d, and had composed a song especially for Istanbul called Lightsoldiers. Turkey\u2019s Hurriyet Daily News quoted him as saying: I brought the piano with my car. I play at the squares for people\u2019s freedom. I came here to support the demonstrations. Martello\u2019s website says he wants to play his grand piano in every capital of the world. The paper reported that Turkish musician Yi\u011fit \u00d6zatalay also played. The paper quoted \u00d6zatalay as saying: \u201cOur freedoms are being restricted. I don\u2019t accept this as an artist.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing live coverage of the protests in Turkey. \u2022 Hundreds of demonstrators have returned to Istanbul\u2019s Taksim Square following a police raid on Tuesday night. Early this morning they chanted, sang and played football after a peaceful night. A concert pianist played a grand piano in the middle of the square last night, and riot police looked on from the side. But there were mixed messages from Turkey\u2019s governing Justice and Development party (AKP) about its possible responses to the protests. \u2022 Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, warned the demonstrators \u2013 who have occupied areas of central Istanbul for two weeks \u2013 that their protests would be over in 24 hours. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ultimatum ratcheted up tensions after a relatively calm day yesterday following Tuesday night\u2019s police raid, which this video shows. The police attack cleared the square of protesters, but hundreds remained in nearby Gezi Park. Erdo\u011fan said: We have not responded to punches with punches. From now on security forces will respond differently. This issue will be over in 24 hours. \u2022 But the deputy chairman of the AKP, H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik, suggested that the problem could be resolved by a city-wide referendum on the issue that sparked the protests: plans to demolish Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall and a replica of an old military barracks. The demonstrations have since snowballed into an unprecedented nationwide display of anger at Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian and Islamist style. But \u00c7elik added that the protesters should now withdraw from the park, saying: \"Those with bad intentions or who seek to provoke and remain in the park will [now] be facing the police.\u201d Some newspapers depicted the referendum plan as the answer to the protests: \"The way out is a referendum,\u201d said the pro-government Star in a front page headline, while Cumhuriyet, which is critical of Erdo\u011fan, went with: \u201cReferendum game.\u201d \u2022 President Abdullah G\u00fcl has struck a more conciliatory tone than Erdo\u011fan, saying: \"If people have objections ... then to engage in a dialogue with these people, to hear out what they say, is no doubt our duty.\u201d But he added: \"Those who employ violence are something different and we have to distinguish them. This would not be allowed in New York, this would not be allowed in Berlin.\" \u2022 The EU voiced its support for the protesters, saying they had been largely peaceful and had been subjected to indiscriminate violence from riot police. It demanded an investigation of the authorities' extreme reaction, and called on Erdo\u011fan to cancel big AKP rallies scheduled for this weekend. Lady Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said: \"There is a real polarisation of opinion. Major AKP rallies in Istanbul and Ankara this weekend would risk adding to the tension when we need to see a de-escalation.\u201d David Cameron, the British prime minister, said the clashes were \u201cdisturbing and concerning\u201d. Three or four people have been killed \u2013 reports differ \u2013 in the two weeks of protests, and a reported 5,000 injured. Erdo\u011fan has accused foreign forces, international media and market speculators of stoking the conflict. We\u2019ll have live coverage of all developments here throughout the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
