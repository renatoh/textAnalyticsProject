At The Hawthorns on Saturday, even before we shipped three first-half goals to Stoke, it was becoming evident that the Baggies weren't clicking, so much so that a stentorian voice behind me yelled: \"Come on Albion! Don't be so (strangled pause) INEPT!\" I guffawed so much I almost didn't swear when the first goal went in. Last week, en route to our game at QPR, I weighed up a falafel wrap at the market at Shepherd's Bush against a possible cheese pasty at the ground. The wrap won. Then its purveyor was in your feature on UK immigrants' contribution to fast food (Weekend, April 7). Only connect, eh? Football, bloody hell! Alan Powell Huddersfield, West Yorkshire It is easy to compare the worst of one sport with the best of another. The violence of the last week reflects more on the xenophobia of the English abroad than it does on football. The game has its ills, not least the greedy excesses of the Premiership and its pampered players, but no other sport comes close to football in its effect on people. Only one game, whether it is watched or played, can summon every emotion within 90 minutes. Only one game is truly global, and is still the people's game, and that is football. Peter Thornton Ramsbottom, Lancashire Suspicions that Martin Kettle is a closet little-England Tory will be fuelled by his preference for golf over football. Both sports provide incomes for his \"overpaid mercenaries from around the globe\", but football's do at least have to cooperate to get their ball into the target. Let Kettle repair to the dreary certainties of a suburban golf club's barroom; real lefties will find the passionate quarrels between football fans far more to their taste.
