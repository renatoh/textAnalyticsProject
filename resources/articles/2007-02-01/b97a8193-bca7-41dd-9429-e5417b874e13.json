Thank you for gracing us with your presence! We are honoured to obey your every word! Scraping and bowing is optional, but if you are one of the 63% blessed with an Indie Manager, you'd better get down on those knees quickly. You see, for the Indie Manager, Alan Sugar is so last year. I'm reliably informed by the chaps at Totaljobs.com that shouting and shirking is out; nurturing a happy-clappy atmosphere is in. It is marvellous news. The idea of a manager who takes responsibility (let alone decisions) is enough to make me come over all funny. \u00b7 I should spend some time waving the Indie Manager research under my boss's nose. Unfortunately, I'm so busy I don't have a minute to spare - and not even because of my appalling time-management skills (or the two duvet days I sneaked in last week). It's because, despite writing WPM, my typing speed isn't up to much. According to Pitman Training, a mere five words-per-minute improvement could free up 113 work hours a year. It's tempting, I admit, but the thought of having to fill another 4.7 days with actual work is more than I can stomach. \u00b7 I mean, what would I do? More filing? I suppose I could finish filling the front of my diary with doodles. One day, it might be worth something. Honest. In any case, news reaches me from Europa that my doodling might be worth more to my manager than to Sotheby's. Apparently, we are all ambitious, free spirited, impatient or insecure doodlers - it's all down to whether you favour stars, eyes, hearts or 3D boxes. It just goes to show that some people have found far better ways to fill their extra 113 hours than I ever will. \u00b7 HR, of course, is closely monitoring my in-office artistry, but it turns out that while worrying about my productivity, they may have taken their eye off the ball. A report, published by Pay Magazine, says the gender pay gap in HR and payroll is widening. Although men make up only 28% of HR teams, 77% of HR directors are men and 80% of employees earning less than \u00a315,000 are women. I don't know whether to burst into tears or merely gawp in astonishment that even the people who set pay scales can't pay women properly. \u00b7 And what are our bosses spending that money on? Why, \"motor-vational\" CDs of course! TV's Lawrence Leyton (not heard of him either) has released Courage to Change and Inspirational Leadership for busy executives who only have time to work on themselves while being driven from one important meeting to the next. I can only conclude this is where HR is going wrong. Releasing The Best Feminist Songs ... Ever is clearly the way forward. And might even get women that payrise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
