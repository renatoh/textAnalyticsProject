Their hero was Jarko Wiss, who scored the decisive goal just five minutes from the end. In the Nationwide League, Fulham, at the opposite end of the First Division to Crewe, suffered only their second home defeat of the season against Birmingham. Remarkable, also, that the Cottagers, the league's highest scoring side, failed to find the net. It might have been a different story had Peter Moller, their loan signing from Spain's Oviedo, had more luck with an early close-range shot that was blocked by Jeremy Gill. Birmingham, boosted by the let-off, started creating chances themselves and seized control with a decisive Martin Grainger goal after 49 minutes. Watford, given the lead at Norwich by Heidar Helguson, then had Gifton Noel-Williams sent off and crashed 2-1. Norwich's goals came from Steen Nedergaard and Lee Marshall in the last 10 minutes. The remarkable scoring run of Bournemouth's Jermain Defoe came to an end at Millwall. Bournemouth won 1-0, but Defoe, who had scored in each of his previous 10 league matches and needed to stretch it to 13 to equal the all-time English football record established by Tom Phillipson for Wolves before the war, was upstaged by Danish midfielder, Claus Jorgensen. His goal was his first in 15 matches, and his seventh of the season. Why is it Chelsea have such a poor away record? One of the most intriguing explanations comes from their Dutch defender Mario Melchiot. In an interview in the club's magazine, Melchiot says: 'When you are away, you can be a victim because it's like you are in an area that you don't belong in. If you are just walking around on your own in a dark place that you don't know, then people will kill you. 'If you go together in a group then you are stronger. I think that's the difference. Because things aren't working out for us away from home, we have to learn to work as a unit. People have to back up each other - to fight together, not individually.' It is a message, of course, that Chelsea would do well to heed in today's FA Cup fourth round tie at Gillingham. But one Gillingham man who refuses to look upon Chelsea's vulnerability away from Stamford Bridge as a reason to be cheerful is their assistant-manager, Richard Hill. No doubt still haunted by the memory of Gillingham's 5-0 defeat by Chelsea last season, he says: 'It would be foolish for us to start talking about form playing any part,' he said. ' 'Both myself and Andy Hessenthaler [Gillingham's player-manager] are young men, but we are also experienced enough not get carried away with all of the hype.' In contrast, Scunthorpe's manager, Brian Laws, is nothing if not upbeat about the prospect of his team winning at Bolton. 'All the pressure is on Bolton,' Laws says. 'We fancy our chances.' And who can blame him after the way his side held their nerve in that Cup penalty shoot-out against Burnley last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
