Speaking three years after producing a hard-hitting report into ministers\u2019 failure to tackle social cohesion, Dame Louise Casey said the gap between the haves and have-nots had widened, communities had become more divided and Muslim women remained the most marginalised group in the UK. Casey said that since her 2016 report grievances and prejudice had deepened and toxic views had become more normalised, describing Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cletter box\u201d Telegraph column last year as \u201cabsolutely extraordinary\u201d. Casey\u2019s report, commissioned by former prime minister David Cameron, advocated initiatives to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, and promote social mixing among young people. \u201cIf you look at the data then and now, little has changed. The brave domestic agenda has been forgotten with universal credit and working-level poverty absolutely symbolic of the country\u2019s dissonance between the rich and poor,\u201d she said. Her key recommendation of teaching English as a second language had been broadly sidelined, Casey said. \u201cIt needs to be a flood of resources, not just a drop here, a drop there. I would set a target that says in five years\u2019 time we want everybody in the country to be able to speak a common language. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d Her report found that people from black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups were three times more likely than white British people to be unemployed, with economic inactivity levels unusually high among women from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. Casey said the situation for many Muslim women had not improved. They still faced a toxic blend of challenges stemming from their gender, their belonging to a community facing hate crime and Islamophobia, as well as sexist, misogynistic and patriarchal behaviour from within their own communities. \u201cIt is still so difficult for Muslim women to stand up and be counted,\u201d she said. Casey said young Muslim women should be able to believe that they could emulate the success of BBC presenter Mishal Husain. \u201cWhen every Asian girl of Muslim heritage has eyes on Mishal Husain, we\u2019re game on. My integration job is over,\u201d said Casey. Integration expert Fiyaz Mughal said that the government\u2019s response to Casey\u2019s review, which also advocated an \u201cintegration oath\u201d to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, had been poor. Mughal, founder of interfaith group Faith Matters, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s response has been too half-hearted and not thought through.\u201d He said ministerial lethargy over the issue had helped contribute to the societal rancour and increase in hate crimes recorded during the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason why the divide in our country opened up so quickly after Brexit, partly because there wasn\u2019t anything strong binding us together, these things can unravel quickly You have to be constantly assisting cohesion,\u201d said Mughal. Casey said that the left should accept some of the blame for failing to speak up on behalf of Muslim women for fear of being labelled Islamophobic. This had prevented them from challenging misogynistic and patriarchal behaviour in some minority communities, she added. \u201cThe left should be shouting from the rooftops for these women, not being quiet about it. I think people get really confused about being anti-religious. They\u2019re worried about being called racist, but it\u2019s not about faith, it\u2019s about equalities, poverty and deprivation,\u201d said the former civil servant, who is promoting the global homelessness event The Big Sleep Out. Casey, head of the former rough sleepers\u2019 unit introduced by Tony Blair, also said that the liberal response to the high-profile row over a long campaign to halt LGBT equality messages being taught in a Birmingham school indicated a lack of progress and confidence in defending and encouraging British values. \u201cI will fight for the right for a Muslim to dress however she wants, but I\u2019ll also fight for the right for Steve to be married to Steve,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be able to be both \u2013 that\u2019s being British, that\u2019s our values and what we fight for \u2013 and it\u2019s not an either or.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
