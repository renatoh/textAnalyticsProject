But that\u2019s exactly how Regina Dugan, the head of Facebook\u2019s innovation skunkworks Building 8, started her presentation at the company\u2019s developer conference F8 on Wednesday. Smartphones have been a powerful force in the world but they have had some \u201cunintended consequences\u201d she said. \u201c[The smartphone] has cost us something. It has allowed us to connect with people far away from us too often at the expense of people sitting right next to us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know intuitively and from experience that we\u2019d all be better off if we looked up a little more often.\u201d Angrily telling people to put down the \u201caddictive drug that is your smartphone\u201d and honor the conversation in front of them is the \u201cwrong narrative\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a false choice. This device is important.\u201d So what is the answer to this very modern affliction? Mindfulness apps? Yoga? A digital detox? Nope. According to Facebook it\u2019s developing technology to read your brainwaves so that you don\u2019t have to look down at your phone to type emails, you can just think them. Facebook has assembled a team of 60 people, including machine learning and neural prosthetics experts, to enable such a system. Facebook is currently hiring a brain-computer interface engineer and a neural imaging engineer. Its goal? To create a system capable of typing one hundred words per minute \u2013 five times faster than you can type on a smartphone \u2013 straight from your brain. \u201cIt sounds impossible but it\u2019s closer than you may realize.\u201d She highlighted the example of a woman with ALS who had a pea-sized implant that could pick up on signals in her brain to allow her to type eight words per minute using the power of thought. Facebook will have to develop a system that doesn\u2019t require surgery to implant electrodes. \u201cThat simply won\u2019t scale,\u201d said Dugan. Instead, Facebook plans to develop non-invasive sensors that can measure brain activity hundreds of times per second at high resolution to decode brain signals associated with language in real time. \u201cNo such technology exists today; we\u2019ll need to develop one.\u201d Facebook is looking at using optical imaging \u2013 using lasers to capture changes in the properties of neurons as they fire \u2013 to glean words straight from our brain before we say them. If these signals can be read, they can be transmitted silently to other people. If the thought that a company that makes almost all of its money from harvesting your personal data could also have access to your thoughts is scary, that\u2019s because it is. Dugan attempted to assuage people\u2019s fears by pointing out that Facebook would only decode the words you were going to say anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s not about decoding random thoughts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decoding the words you\u2019ve already decided to share by sending them to the speech center of your brain.\u201d Quite how consumers would know whether the privacy of their \u201crandom thoughts\u201d was also being violated remains be seen, but Dugan remained upbeat, describing the concept as having the \u201cconvenience of voice but the privacy of text\u201d. \u201cYou can text a friend without taking out your phone or send a quick email without missing a party. No more false choices.\u201d But this is a false choice. Just because you aren\u2019t typing into a phone doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t distracted by its underlying capabilities. You are still composing an email with your mind even though you might be face to face with a friend. Arguably being present but distracted is worse than taking a moment to type a message into a device. At least the other person knows what\u2019s going on. Another reason why Facebook wants to read our brain activity is to develop the equivalent of a \u201cbrain mouse\u201d for augmented reality. She painted a picture of a future where everyone wears augmented reality glasses that supplement our field of vision with additional information such as directions, and enhanced capabilities such as real-time translation of people\u2019s voice or the ability to \u201cmute\u201d specific people and noises from your soundscape. What\u2019s lacking in this augmented future is a user interface. When we don\u2019t have a smartphone or a computer mouse, how can we select and click on a piece of digital content? That\u2019s where the brain-computer interface comes in. Another problem Facebook wants to solve is how to input those thoughts to another person\u2019s brain. It\u2019s all very well being able to think an email into existence, but the other person still has to read it. Facebook wants the recipient not to read the email, but to feel it. Dugan showed a video of experiment her team had set up where basic words were communicated via a sleeve worn on the arm that vibrates in specific patterns. \u201cFrances is an electrical engineer. She can hear through her skin,\u201d said Dugan. What does it mean to \u201chear\u201d through one\u2019s skin? Just as blind people learn to read braille, Frances had learned a vocabulary of nine words that correspond to different sensations delivered by the sleeve. With an hour of practice she now feels the words. In the future, said Dugan, \u201cit may be possible for me to think in Mandarin and you to feel it instantly in Spanish\u201d. Dugan acknowledged there were a lot of hard problems to solve first, but said \u201csuccess matters, so if we fail it\u2019s gonna suck\u201d. However, that\u2019s one of the risks associated with doing work that matters. \u201cThe risk of failure and that slightly terrified feeling that comes with it is the price we pay for the privilege of making something great,\u201d she said. If Facebook does succeed, however, it won\u2019t just be its research and development teams who feel \u201cslightly terrified\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
