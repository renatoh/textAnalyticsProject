And the answer isn't intoxicating substances. It's Ibiza. The BBC Radio 1 folklore archive is stuffed to the gunnels with the good, the bad and the very messy moments that happened on the shores of the White Isle, where the station is about to celebrate its 10th year of broadcasts. It's enough to make any self-respecting former raver go misty-eyed. After recording a Nicky Holloway Essential Mix at the Ku club (now Privilege) in 1995, producer Eddie Gordon and Pete Tong had to twist the arm of then station controller, Matthew Bannister, to let them do some thing bigger the following year. Just think, if they hadn't succeeded I'Anson might still have a job, but more of that later. In 1996, the Ibiza scene exploded and so did the windows at Cafe del Mar, where Tong had attracted so many people the windows cracked. But it was in 1998 that it all went a bit 'Pete Tong' for Radio 1's staffers and one of the most legendary disappearing acts in media occurred. \"I've always tried to be professional, I'd always considered myself to be one of the good girls. But Ibiza blew me away,\" says I'Anson now. \"I did my show on Saturday then went out and got lost! What happened? I missed a day of work; I'm not defending my behaviour at all. Would I do it again? No. Do I regret it? Yes. \"What would I say to anyone who hasn't been to Ibiza? Approach with caution. Or stay at home and switch on Radio 1,\" she added. Ian Parkinson, Radio 1's head of specialist music programmes, puts it another way: \"There had been tabloid accusations of us being closely linked to Manumission, where sex is openly promoted on stage...But then we lost Lisa I'Anson in Manumission - later found in a less than coherent state...Lisa left Radio 1 but it wasn't a direct result of this but clearly it didn't help.\" It was the year that FatBoy Slim Norman Cook arrived at the Radio 1 villa and promptly asked breakfast show host Zoe Ball : \"How do you fancy not going to bed with me tonight?\" After an all-night session, Ball threw up 2 minutes before going on air, and funnily enough, has never been asked back. The pair married within the year. Ahhh. A year later the grand dame of larging it, Annie Nightingale, was manhandled off the decks at Pacha: \"I think they just wanted house music and we were playing breakbeat...It was very upsetting.\" And in 2000 Sara Cox singled-handedly outraged the nation by wondering, out loud, live on air on her breakfast show, what the Queen mum smelt of. \"At one point I looked around for my agent Melanie and she was poledancing! It's eight in the morning and she's sliding around a pole...Then I suggested the Queen mum smelt of wee...sometimes you don't realise what the consequences of what you're broadcasting,\" Cox recalls. Radio 1's Ibiza weekend kicks off this Friday evening with Pete Tong's Essential Selection live from Cafe Mambo. Never mind the antics of the mad-for-it clubbers, it's the Radio 1 staff Ibiza has to worry about. Radio 1's Top 10 Ibiza tunes: 1. Stardust 'Music Sounds Better With You' 2. Energy'Cafe Del Mar' 3.
