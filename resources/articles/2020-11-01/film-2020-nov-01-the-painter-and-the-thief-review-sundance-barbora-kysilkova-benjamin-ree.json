Addict Karl-Bertil Nordland stole the paintings but claimed he was too wasted to remember what he did with them. Kysilkova asked not for recompense, but for a chance to understand. She asked him to sit for a portrait. And Nordland\u2019s reaction to the picture \u2013 a man for the first time seen but not judged \u2013 is a devastating moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
