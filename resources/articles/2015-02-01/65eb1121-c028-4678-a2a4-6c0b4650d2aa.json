His answers are out there on the pitch and in the scoring charts for all to see. The 21-year-old\u2019s confidence and conversion rate are so high, not to mention his technical excellence and energetic attitude, and with Kane having doubled his pre-season target of 10 goals within two-thirds of the campaign, it is no wonder the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has no fear in suggesting he aims to treble it by May. Kane himself, the Premier League\u2019s leading scorer in all competitions, is refusing to publicise how high he feels he can finish in the goalscorers\u2019 parade or Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League. Why let anything disrupt the rhythm and focus? \u201cI set myself [a target to score] 10 goals at the start and then 20 after that,\u201d the England contender said. \u201cI\u2019m there now. I will set myself another little target in my head that I will try and get to, and do it as quickly as possible hopefully. There are still a lot of games to go and I\u2019m feeling confident on the pitch at the minute.\u201d Similarly, with Spurs sitting two points off the top four after six league wins in eight, before Saturday\u2019s derby with Arsenal, between the teams placed fifth and sixth, Kane has no need to set any hares running with his comments. \u201cThere is still a long way to go, plenty of games to play,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to keep focused on that. We are still in a lot of competitions. Come the end of the season we will see where we are. \u201cIt is probably the biggest game of the season so far, playing Arsenal at home. It is big for the fans, the players, the club \u2013 everyone who is involved. We have a week now to rest so we are really looking forward to it.\u201d Pochettino said he has not been surprised by what Kane has achieved so far this season. \u201cNo, because I never put a ceiling on any player,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIf he scores 20, why not 30? Always he needs the chance to play. I never put the target to my players. If you have potential and can improve it is only up to you. \u201cThe problem arrives when the player believes he is \u2018done\u2019 and can\u2019t improve. It is important he keeps this mentality that he is hungry every day to improve and keep going forward.\u201d In this respect Christian Eriksen is a prime role model, Pochettino emphasising how his playmaker regularly practises his deadball deliveries. It was the Dane\u2019s free-kick, his 11th goal of the season making him the top-scoring midfielder in the Premier League, that set up Spurs, Capital One Cup finalists and in the last 32 of the Europa League, for a victory that Pochettino ranked among his team\u2019s best of the season. And what a season it is promising to be. Kane\u2019s two goals, a rapidly dispatched low shot after cutting inside Andre Wisdom and a calm penalty after Joleon Lescott handled Kyle Walker\u2019s cross, sandwiched what could have been a brave comeback by West Bromwich Albion had it not been for Hugo Lloris\u2019s brilliant saves from James Morrison and Claudio Yacob. Craig Dawson and Craig Gardner also struck the woodwork for West Brom who, losing for the first time under Tony Pulis, were undone by their slow start \u2013 or, to be fair, Tottenham\u2019s electric start. Albion\u2019s new manager would like a new left-back and a target man before the transfer window shuts. \u201cI\u2019m not spinning as many plates as usual,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if they drop for us I\u2019ll be very pleased.\u201d Man of the match Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
