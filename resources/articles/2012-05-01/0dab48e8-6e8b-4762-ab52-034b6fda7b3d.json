The evening can be quickly summed up as \"great songs, daft book\"; and one simply waits patiently for the next Irving Berlin number or elegant dance routine to come along which, happily, they do with reasonable frequency. The movie original was actually based on a play co-written by one Alexander Farago; and that seems the right surname for the author of a silly story that manages to make a single gag about mistaken identity last an entire evening. The plot hinges on the fact that a swish model, Dale Tremont, erroneously believes that her ardent pursuer, Jerry Travers, is married to a friend of hers. Films and plays have perhaps been spun around slighter premises, but what makes this peculiarly idiotic is that Travers is a fabled Broadway star about to open in a big London show. You'd have thought that even a model might have read the papers. Escapism, however, is the name of the game and Matthew White and Howard Jacques, who have adapted the movie for the stage, do a decent job in trimming the longueurs and keeping the wisecracks coming. \"Is there no beginning to your talents?\" the heroine waspishly asks of the assiduously dancing hero. A wife-dominated producer also tells him: \"A man is incomplete until he's married \u2013 after that he's finished.\" And, if that has a dated misogynist ring, that is in keeping with a period piece in which all foreigners are automatically funny and all servants and theatrical dressers suggest camp is on the verge of being struck. But the piece survives on the imperishable Berlin songs and the charm of the performers. The great strength of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers was that his aristocratic lightness found a perfect foil in her robust earthiness. And, even if you can't match the original, Tom Chambers and Summer Strallen here do a sterling job. As a former winner of Strictly Come Dancing, Chambers is not only personable and light on his feet but makes it look as if he actively enjoys Puttin' On The Ritz or gliding around Cheek to Cheek. And Strallen has a similar graceful ease and attractiveness, and is seductively funny in a number Wild About You, where she wraps her long legs round his willing torso. Matthew White's production also keeps the action moving, Hildegard Bechtler's sets have a pleasing art deco look to them, and Bill Deamer's choreography is at its inventive best in Berlin's catchy, cod-Venetian number The Piccolino. The two leads are gamely supported by Ricardo Afonso as an explosive Latin dressmaker who comes out with language-mangling phrases like \"Why not face the musicians now?\", and by Martin Ball as a mildly philandering and slightly effete theatrical producer. It's all perfectly pleasant and one can never hear too often Berlin standards like Isn't This a Lovely Day To Be Caught in the Rain? I just hope the future of the musical doesn't reside in endless revivals of Hollywood's golden oldies and that one day we shall encounter again a new musical based on an original idea. Gilt-edged escapism is all very well in its way but it doesn't take the genre any further forwards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
