But many that remain, either as working mills or converted into quirky dwellings, while prominent in the landscape, are obvious only because they are tall rather than on hilltops. Research shows a high proportion of windmills that were recorded but have since been demolished and disappeared were sited beside rivers. The reason is many were also close to water mills, and owned by the same milling families who were often the local bakers. Bread was the staple diet for centuries and ensuring regular supplies of flour for the average consumption of two loaves for each person a week was vital. Many water mills were sited on relatively small streams so in times of drought milling would have been impossible \u2013 hence the insurance of having a windmill nearby, or in rare cases even part of the same building. There was another rash of windmill building near existing water mills in the early 19th century when canals were being constructed. Canals diverted vital water resources needed for milling to replenish locks, causing many legal disputes between millers and canal companies. As the industrial revolution progressed millers realised water and wind could be replaced or supplemented by steam power and the age of windmill building ended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
