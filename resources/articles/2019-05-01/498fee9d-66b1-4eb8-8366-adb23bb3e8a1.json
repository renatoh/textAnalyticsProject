Terry, who joined Dean Smith\u2019s backroom staff at Aston Villa in October, said he had enjoyed a \u201cgreat first year\u201d of coaching, which culminated in a play-off victory against Derby County. Terry celebrated Villa\u2019s Premier League return as an assistant coach at Wembley on Monday, a year on from his final game as a player. \u201cIt is just great to see young managers like Stevie and Lamps getting the opportunities,\u201d said Terry, the 38-year-old former Chelsea captain. \u201cIn the long run obviously that is my ambition but I\u2019m not thinking about that. As a player I got to the heights I wanted to get to but, and I firmly believe this, I\u2019m a YTS again. \u201cI\u2019m starting right from the very bottom and I\u2019m not afraid to say that. I\u2019m not afraid to do all the dirty work \u2013 picking up the cones, the balls and the bibs; all of that stuff is part of my education. I\u2019ve got a great teacher in Dean and Richard [O\u2019Kelly, the assistant coach] as well to bounce things off. I\u2019m very fortunate to be able to sit there and learn from them because they are superb. \u201cI think you know as a player when time is up really and I kind of knew that last year in my last game at Wembley. It is something I have been planning for a few years and the experience and the day-to-day work on the training field with the defenders and the group, and what the manager allows me to do, has been fantastic for me.\u201d Terry said he believed promotion will enable Villa to retain their prized assets, including the captain, Jack Grealish, who joined the club aged six. \u201cIt is great that we have gone up and we get to keep the likes of Jack, John McGinn and our top players. It\u2019s Jack\u2019s football club \u2013 he\u2019s been here right from when he was a boy and it\u2019s great to see. We are not just going in to make the numbers up. We have players out of contract and we need to strengthen to make the jump of course but, if we add in the right departments, I\u2019m sure we will be fine.\u201d Terry said that, although it was tough for Lampard\u2019s first season in management to end in defeat, he should be commended for an \u201cincredible\u201d campaign. Terry revealed he went into the Derby dressing room after the game to speak to Lampard, the assistant manager Jody Morris, the first-team coach, Chris Jones, and the defender Ashley Cole, good friends from his 22 years at Chelsea. \u201cHe has got a great future in management, for sure,\u201d Terry said of Lampard. Tammy Abraham, who has been on loan at Villa from Chelsea, has made it clear he wants to play first-team football in the top flight next season. Villa are understood to be keen on signing the striker in a \u00a325m permanent deal. With Chelsea facing a two-window Fifa transfer ban, Abraham is among the youngsters hoping to benefit from more first-team opportunities. If called on, he is adamant he could lead the line. \u201cEvery player wants to start,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously if it is at Chelsea a team like Chelsea is always difficult because they have got world-class players. It is always going to be difficult to bring in youngsters and bring in people like myself. It is a big role. \u201cBut for me it is about believing in myself and to just keep doing what I do. I am still young and I am still improving. The aim is to be at the highest level and playing the best football and, if Chelsea say they need me there, I will put 100% in. \u201cI am a person who believes in myself. So, wherever I am at, I believe I will get in and play and score goals.\u201d Asked if he could return to Villa next season, the 21-year-old replied: \u201cYou can never say never.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
