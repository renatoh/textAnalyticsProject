However, team sources have confirmed that in addition to McNish, talks have taken place with Nick Heidfeld, the current Jordan driver Ralph Firman and the displaced Justin Wilson. McNish seemed upbeat. \"I'm still talking with Jordan at the moment and things are progressing,\" he said. \"I've visited the factory and seen the car and the wind tunnel, and I'm right up to speed with where the team is. \"There's been so much speculation recently over this seat with Jordan, but that's only to be expected with only a few places left up for grabs. However, with the new testing regulations it puts even more emphasis on an experienced driver.\" McNish drove for the fledgling Toyota formula one team alongside Mika Salo in 2002, but both men were dropped from the line-up and replaced by Olivier Panis and Cristiano da Matta at the start of this season. Since then the 33-year-old Scot has impressed in his testing role at Renault alongside Fernando Alonso and Jarno Trulli. He added: \"All I can say at the moment is that I firmly believe I can do the job for Jordan, both on and off the track. I've made no secret of wanting to get back on the grid, and after such a good 2003 withRenault it has only increased my desire to be racing again.\" Meanwhile, Rubens Barrichello has called on Ferrari to confirm whether or not he will be offered a new contract as Michael Schumacher's team-mate at the end of next season before the 2004 world championship begins in three months' time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
