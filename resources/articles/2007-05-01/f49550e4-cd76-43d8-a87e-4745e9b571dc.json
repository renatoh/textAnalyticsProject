In setting about it, the environment secretary, David Miliband, had to juggle his own admirable enthusiasm for using waste food for energy production, his government's reluctance to compel business to change its ways and the future prime minister's expressed desire to devolve more decisions to local communities. Mr Miliband produced in the Commons yesterday a less than convincing list of proposals to cut the half-tonne of waste we each produce every year. His ambitions - higher targets for recycling and composting, consulting on a ban on single-use shopping bags, and best of all an opt-out for all direct mail - are right. But their scope is far too modest to send out the resounding message that we all need to hear: the throwaway society has had its day. Rubbish has emerged as one of the most delicate issues of local politics. Analysis of the elections three weeks ago indicate that the introduction of fortnightly refuse collections, which have a dramatic impact on the amount of rubbish put out, also have a dramatic effect on local councillors' electoral appeal. Mr Miliband sensibly proposes to allow councils to impose new penalties on households that do not do their bit, while insisting that they give the money back in rewards to those who excel. Yet the Conservatives look set to resist this as a stealth tax - even as they demand tough action from government. But political sensitivity is no excuse. There was a timorous feel to his statement that suggests the environment secretary is not quite convinced by the old saw that every challenge can also be an opportunity. England is at least 10 years behind northern Europe in dealing with waste and will still trail the Scandinavian countries even after Mr Miliband's limited targets are reached. It is not only the virtuous citizens of Sweden and Denmark, though. Flanders in Belgium already recycles more than 70% of its waste. England will only reach 50% by 2020. Many countries have distinct categories of recyclable plastics. Here it is not uncommon to find no plastic recycling at all. Yet across the country hundreds of thousands of people have embraced waste reduction with the fervour of a new religion, rewarded only by a sense that they are doing the right thing. In local authorities in Bristol, or Somerset or Essex or Cambridgeshire, there are beacons of good practice that show how local councils respond to local pressure: Cambridgeshire county council recycles or composts more than 50% of its waste. Tomorrow night Rebecca Hosking's film about the damage that rubbish does will be shown on BBC2, just weeks after she persuaded her home town of Modbury in Devon to introduce an ecological alternative to plastic bags. The culture is changing, but slowly and - as suggested by the alarming statistics for fly-tipping, for which prosecutions have doubled - very unevenly. England is not just the dirty man of Europe. It is the capital of consumption. Waste is the end of a chain that needs tackling right at the start. Mr Miliband, citing a future EU directive, is to consult with business on packaging and shopping bags. Lobbyists wonder why he does not insist, instead of cheering from the sidelines when Sainsbury turns a reusable bag into a successful public-relations campaign. It is when the government has got tough, as with the landfill tax, that most progress has been made. Attitudes must change so the whole business of waste is revolutionised. Why shouldn't one person's waste be another's resource? Mr Miliband seems to have got the general idea, encouraging weekly food-waste collections for bio-gas. That has the added advantage that household as well as community composting gets easier when the kind of rubbish that rats love is taken away first. Local recycling should mean local jobs and local products. Rubbish would no longer be out of sight, out of mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
