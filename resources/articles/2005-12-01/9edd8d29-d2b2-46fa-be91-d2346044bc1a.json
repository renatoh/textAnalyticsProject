Few can properly pronounce its name, fewer still can spell it. But none of this matters when you have all the right ingredients for a perfect city break. Once the domain of the backpacker crowd, Ljubljana, the political, economic and cultural centre of Slovenia, is quickly emerging as one of Europe's must-do weekend destinations. And the festive season - when Ljubljana's Christmas market is in full swing, the castle and streets are beautifully lit with white lights and the ski resort of Krvavec is just a 35-minute drive away - is the perfect time to visit. Slovenia is half the size of Switzerland and fits snugly between Italy, Hungary, Austria and Croatia, with a 26-mile coastline on the Adriatic Sea. Part of the former Yugoslav Federation, in 1991 its two million inhabitants, generally regarded as the most European of the republics, were the first to break free. With a population of 280,000, Ljubljana is Slovenia's largest and most cosmopolitan city by far but to an outsider it will feel more like a quaint provincial town than a capital. A little gem of a city, it has everything you would want in a weekend break, only in small doses. Two or three days is ample time to cover its highlights. Many visitors happily spend their time meandering along its cobbled streets or sitting in a pavement cafe in one of its squares (whose terraces are made cosy with outdoor heaters in winter), but Ljubljana also has a handful of museums, art galleries, festivals, a theatre and a hilltop castle with views for miles. It has a bustling market, a park and a narrow river running through it, the Ljubljanica, which is perfect for crisp, wintery afternoon strolls or boat trips. The architecture is a mix of Renaissance, Baroque and Art Nouveau, but take a guided tour and one name will keep cropping up. Architect Joze Plecnik was born in Ljubljana in 1872, educated in Graz in Austria, and then lived in Prague for 10 years where he helped renovate Prague Castle. Inspired by classical Greek and Roman architecture, mixed with Byzantine, Islamic, ancient Egyptian and folklore myths, Plecnik returned to his native city and made his mark on many of its key structures - the National and University Library, Central Market, the banks of the Ljubljanica, Triple Bridge and Tivoli Park to name but a few. Perhaps the only area where Ljubljana might disappoint is its clothes and shoes shopping. Prices are not much cheaper than the UK and there is only a sprinkling of decent stores in its centre - the Nama department store, a Zara and Benetton. After dark, Ljubljana has enough chic bars, cosy inns with open fires and sophisticated restaurants to keep tourists entertained. Head down to Macek, the riverside bar and popular meeting place, on any night of the week and you will be mixing with visitors and locals alike. Since Easyjet began daily flights from Stansted to Ljubljana last year, British visitor numbers have grown significantly, but thankfully the city hasn't yet fallen victim to rowdy stag groups. The largest number of visitors are from neighbouring Italy, which adds a certain amount of glamour. A youthful energy, meanwhile, comes from the 56,000 students who attend its university and young Slovenians lured in droves from rural towns and villages looking for work and a more vibrant lifestyle. Having joined the European Union, Slovenia is scheduled to adopt the euro in January 2007 and, if the experience of other euro countries is anything to go by, this is likely to push up prices. Don't miss the boat. A room for the night Budget Hostel Celica (Metelkova 8, 00 386 1 230 9700; www.hostelcelica.com). Probably the funkiest hostel you'll ever find, the 92-bed Celica was once a military prison but now its double cells are so popular they are booked weeks in advance. Architects from all over Europe were invited to decorate each of the 20 cells and they are so sought-after there are daily tours at 1pm for non-guests. There is also free internet access, a cafe and a range of dorms and self-catering apartments. Cells \u00a316pp, normal rooms \u00a314pp, and a bed in a dormitory (sleeping up to 14 people) is \u00a312pp, including breakfast. Moderate CityHotel Ljubljana (Dalmatinova 15; 00 386 1 234 9130; www.hotelturist.si). Slightly lacking in character, this 123-room hotel is clean, functional and in a prime location in the city centre. It also has a pleasant garden and a cybercafe. Doubles from \u00a374. Luxury Grand Hotel Union (Miklosiceva cesta 1; 00 386 1 308 1270; www.gh-union.si). Ljubljana's finest hotel, the four-star Grand Hotel Union is firmly geared towards business travellers. It has hosted the likes of Bill Clinton and Roger Moore, but in truth it doesn't compare with top hotels elsewhere. The buffet breakfast, though, is impressive and all the facilities are here - indoor pool, sauna, gym, parking, shop. Doubles from \u00a395. Where to eat Budget Gostilna Sokol (Ciril Metodov Trg 18; 00 386 1 439 6855; www.gostilna-sokol.com). Students gather on the ground floor for pizza, while tourists and families go for more traditional Slovenian cuisine upstairs. Rustic and simple, this laid-back place is full of atmosphere day and night. House specialities include game goulash with bread dumplings or a 'country feast' with fried sausage, dried pork chops, cabbage, turnips and buckwheat dumplings. Vegetarians should try the struklj, made with cottage cheese. Mains around \u00a36. Moderate It seems a sin to come to Slovenia and eat Mexican food, but the funky Restaurantes Cantina Mexicana (Knafljev Prehod; 00 386 1 426 9325) is well worth a visit. It serves Mexican to rival the best in a colourful, fun setting, and the staff are nice to look at too! Anyway, if you're here for more than a few days you might be craving something a bit spicy. If not, at least pop by for a margarita on its terrace. Mains around \u00a37. Luxury Pri Vitezu (Breg 18-20; 00 386 1 426 6058) is a chic riverside restaurant with a pretty covered outside terrace for daytime and a smart interior. Food is modern Mediterranean. Mains around \u00a310. Also try Gostilna As (Knafljev Prehod; 00 386 1 425 8822). Renowned for its seafood and super-size wine list, this swanky restaurant is where the locals come for a big occasion. Mains \u00a310. Upstairs is the less formal and more funky As Lounge. Big night out Most nights out in Ljubljana start at its most popular meeting place, Macek, (Krojaska Ulica 5) or any of the riverside bars that sit alongside it. The McCartneys were spied hanging out here in the summer. Alternatively, try one of the drinking holes in Knefljev Prehod, a pedestrianised area just off the river on the opposite side. The English pub-style Cutty Sark and the more stylish As Lounge are the most lively and both have outside tables (heated in winter). You won't get the river views here, but the atmosphere is just as vibrant. The most sophisticated bars, however, are in Mestni Trg in the Old Town. Minimal (no 4) is all-white, with leather low-slung sofas and a huge cocktail list. Bars officially close at 1am (often later) but die-hards should continue at the swanky Global Club, on the sixth floor of the Nama department store, or Bacchus Centre Club (Kongresni Trg 3). Objects of desire Shops close around midday on Saturdays and don't open at all on Sundays, so if you're here over the weekend, Saturday morning is your only chance to spend. The market is great for foodie gifts, especially honey. The gift shop at the castle and Skrina (Trousseau, Breg 8) have good-quality Slovenian crafts and souvenirs - beehive panels, heart-shaped honey cakes, Prekmurje black pottery and lace. Girlie girls will love Nana (Cankarjevo Nabrezje 13), which sells ultra-feminine jewellery, scarves, shoes and throws, mainly in shades of pink. Get out of town From mid-November to the end of March you can ski within a 35-minute drive of Ljubljana at Krvavec, one of the country's most popular ski areas. Regular buses run from the main station. A cable car, chairlifts and T-bar tows serve more than 20 miles of slopes and two miles of cross-country runs. Skiing is Slovenia's national sport and a ski pass is considerably cheaper here than in the Alps, so even non-skiers should give it a go. In the summer, Krvavec is also a good starting point for hikes. Krvavec Ski Centre (00 386 252 5930; www.rtc-krvavec.si). Getting around The city is so small you'll probably get by with just walking but there is an efficient bus service running until midnight. Buses run around every 15 minutes on main routes and you pay a flat fare on board or use a tiny plastic token available at news-stands or post offices. Taxis are cheap. Getting there City break specialist Regent Holidays (0117 921 1711; www.regent-holidays.co.uk) offers a three-night B&amp;B stay in Ljubljana for \u00a3350 per person, including return Adria Airways flights from Gatwick and transfers. Three nights in an executive room at the Grand Hotel Union costs \u00a3420 per person, with return flights. Prices are based on two sharing. Further information Call the Ljubljana Tourist Office (00 3 86 1 306 4575; www.ljubljana-tourism.si) or contact the UK Slovenia Tourist Office (0870 225 5305; www.slovenia.info; slovenia.tourism@virgin.net). Prices have been converted from Slovenian tolars(SIT) and euros, both of which are currently used. Five things you must do 1 Fly through your Christmas shopping list at the city's festive fair in Presernov Trg, open from 10am to 9pm daily and running until 2 January. Stalls selling crafts, mulled wine and traditional delicacies, with folk bands and choirs dotted around, make it a great Slovenian social event. For details see www.ljubljana-tourism.si. 2 Get on yer bike. It's not quite Amsterdam, but Ljubljana is a small, flat and cycle-friendly city and many locals travel by two wheels instead of four. Thanks to an initiative by the tourist office, visitors can hire bikes for free for two hours. Go to the Slovenian Tourist Office (Krekov Trg 10). 3 Climb up to Ljubljana Castle, not so much for the castle itself (it looks more impressive from the city below than close up, especially when floodlit after dark), but for the rooftop views of the city. Climb to the top of the tower via a wrought-iron staircase (95 steps) and walk along the ramparts for views into the Old Town and across the river. There has been a castle on this steep hill since Celtic times, but the existing structure mostly dates from a rebuild following an earthquake in 1511. It has been a palace, prison and barracks, but now it is mainly used for concerts and weddings. It's home to the city's registry office so go up on a Saturday and you'll see a stream of weddings. Admission free. 4 Get up early for a stroll through the market. In a vast market place south-east of Presernov Trg, locals sell everything from flowers and fruit (home-grown in their gardens in the city suburbs) to crafts and clothes. The market is open every day, except Sundays, until mid-afternoon but it's at its best on Saturday mornings before 11am. On Sundays, there's an equally enticing flea and antiques market running along the east side of the Ljubljanica River. 5 Take a pew at the Kavarna Plocnik for live entertainment and people-watching. This pavement cafe, next to the Ljubljanica River on Presernov Trg, is in the perfect spot for sitting and watching the world go by. During the summer, live performers entertain the crowds. In the winter it's still a popular meeting spot. Don't even think about ... \u00b7 Hiring a car. You'll need one only if you want to venture outside the city. Although Ljubljana might not seem to have much traffic, parking spaces are sparse and expensive. \u00b7 Hiring a 'tourist' bike without giving it a quick test run first. They are well used and sometimes come back in a far from perfect state. Check for wobbly seats, weak brakes and flat tyres. \u00b7 Asking the waiter/barman for Diet Coke, or any other low-cal drink. Although you can buy them in most supermarkets, you'll be hard pressed to find a bar that serves them in the whole of Slovenia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
