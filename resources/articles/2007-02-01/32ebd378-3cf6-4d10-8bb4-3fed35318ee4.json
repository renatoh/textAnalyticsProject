As soon as I was appointed, 15 months ago, I spoke to the principals and media staff and found that the sector recognised it was fairly weak at projecting its own good reputation. So this course emanates from customer demand: the principals said they would welcome some practical, hands-on media training. It's aimed primarily at principals or deputies, but marketing and press officers have also shown an interest in doing it. We've had three courses so far. The morning session consists of lectures from three of us, who are experienced, hands-on media gurus, and in the afternoon students do live interviews in front of the cameras. The main focus is on crisis management. We give them five to 10 minutes' preparation for each scenario, and then it's straight into a TV studio with lots of people rushing around, cameras in your face. The lighting is hot, so they're thoroughly uncomfortable from start to finish. And, of course, our TV interviewer makes sure that level of discomfort continues. Then it's straight into a hot debrief from the experts. It's a magic job. I've been training for 15 years and this is my favourite course, because people are so exposed - they've got no props, no comfort zone. I'm pretty tired when I come out, but that's nothing compared with those who've gone through the training. We're looking to do 10 courses this year. Although it started off as a membership service for the south-east, the feedback we've had is that it has a national aspect. So we look forward to seeing people from Newcastle, Scotland, basically from wherever. \u00b7 Alan Corbett is the media trainer on the TV interview techniques course at Amersham and Wycombe College"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
