Alli was offered to the French champions last month and has not featured in the Premier League for Spurs since being substituted at half-time against Everton on the opening day. The 24-year-old has made one appearance since, in the Europa League qualifying win over Shkendija in North Macedonia last week. It is understood Tottenham immediately rejected PSG\u2019s offer, with Alli set to remain and fight for his place in Mourinho\u2019s squad. The Spurs manager would not be drawn on Wednesday over whether Alli could be handed an opportunity in Thursday night\u2019s Europa play-off against Maccabi Haifa, although he did praise the player\u2019s reaction to being largely on the sidelines. \u201cI cannot confirm Dele\u2019s playing tomorrow but I cannot confirm he\u2019s not playing,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe have still training sessions today, we have still decisions to make. The only thing I can say is he\u2019s being very, very professional. I have only respect for him.\u201d Tottenham are on the verge of bringing Benfica striker Vin\u00edcius to the club on loan. The 25-year-old Brazilian is represented by Jorge Mendes\u2019s company, Gestifute. Mourinho is also represented by Mendes. A loan deal with a \u20ac45m option to buy has been agreed between the two clubs. When asked last night whether a deal was close, Mourinho said: \u201cNo, I want you to ask me that question when it\u2019s confirmed. Nobody told me it\u2019s done so I\u2019m going to respect the player, respect Benfica and wait a little bit more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
