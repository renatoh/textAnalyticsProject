Up to 9,000 students were told by the university admissions service Ucas they had declined their places by default because they had not confirmed their first and second choices. Ucas blamed the problem, first reported by EducationGuardian.co.uk, on the Royal Mail losing the students' responses in the post, unclear information on the admission service's website and the decision not to send out reminder letters to students. The Royal Mail claims it lost only 200 letters, but today Anthony McClaran, Ucas chief executive, said at least 1,400 dated reply slips had arrived a month after they were sent by students and so had missed the deadline. He said the Royal Mail's figure was \"not really right at all\", having expected it to come up with thousands rather than hundreds of lost letters. \"It's difficult to know what to do is when the Royal Mail say 200. We have to wait for their investigation to let us know the real number. We've already taken measures to address the problem. We've responded quickly and issued the apology. We need that report from them,\" he said. A spokesman for the Royal Mail said: \"We are taking responsibility for just over 200 and we apologise for that delay. We don't want to get into a slanging match with Ucas. One bag was sent to another address, that was one bag too many.\" He said the report into the matter would not be made public. Earlier this week, Phil Willis, Liberal Democrat education spokesman questioned the education secretary, Charles Clarke, on the missing letters, demanding to know how many students were involved. Today, David Rendel, the party's higher education spokesman, said: \"This situation is completely unacceptable and we need an immediate investigation to find out just what went wrong. Ucas blaming the post office and the post office blaming Ucas is far from a satisfactory explanation. \"The future of our students should not have to rely on whether or not they were lucky enough to have had their application processed. It is not good enough and it is crucial that we ensure this doesn't happen again.\" Mr McClaran said Ucas had run a second check on its computer that automatically sends out decline by default letters. The test indicated that compared with this point last year fewer students had declined by default. \"That indicates that we've entirely caught up,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
