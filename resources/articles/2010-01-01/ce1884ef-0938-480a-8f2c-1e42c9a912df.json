The H\u00e4nssler disc includes one of the most substantial of them, the \"cantata hermetica\", Quid Est Deus, composed in 2007. It sets 24 Latin definitions of God as a series of choral statements, often with minimal orchestral accompaniment. There's an austere, hieratic quality about the writing, and a Stravinsky-like feel to some of the harmony (deliberately or not, a recurring progression almost directly quotes from the Symphony of Psalms), though the orchestral outbursts that occasionally punctuate the sequence have a highly wrought expressionist edge. It's a compellingly concentrated piece, very different from the sparer, earlier works on the disc, which belong to the period in the late 1980s and early 90s when Rihm was influenced by Luigi Nono's late works. These use spatial effects, dispersing the orchestra around the performing space: Ungemaltes Bild (Unpainted Picture) attempts to convey in sound the spirit of a watercolour series by Nolde, while Frau/Stimme sets a Heiner M\u00fcller text for two sopranos, embedding it in fractured, halting orchestral textures from which it emerges piecemeal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
