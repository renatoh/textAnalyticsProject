Now we know: the prince of naff is to keep the US president away from \u201cpolitical conversations\u201d by talking to him about golf. Yes, really: Andrew will accompany Trump on two of the three days of his British trip. Hopefully, then, Prince Charles won\u2019t have to bring up the climate crisis that Trump denies, Prince Harry will not have to defend the supposed nastiness of his wife\u2019s remarks, and he and Prince William will not have to make small talk with a man who said in public he could have \u201cnailed\u201d their mother. The Queen may indeed signal her distaste through the medium of jewellery or whatever, but frankly this visit is an abomination and the royal collusion is vile. Still, Andrew will have a lot to chat about with Trump besides golf. They met 20 years ago at Mar-a-Lago through their former friend, Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender accused of abusing dozens of underage girls. In a court statement, Epstein\u2019s former handyman alleged that Andrew used to attend pool parties full of adolescent girls, staying in guest rooms with soap in the shape of genitalia. Classy. After Epstein got out of prison, Andrew was seen strolling with him in New York, shortly after which Fergie accepted \u00a315,000 from Epstein to clear her debts. This was put down, as everything is, to an error of judgment on the Duchess of York\u2019s part. Andrew, it was thought, was no longer such a great ambassador as he hung out with Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s son Saif and various oligarchs. Meanwhile, there was much speculation after his \u201cSouth York\u201d mansion, which had been on the market for five years, was suddenly snapped up for \u00a315m \u2013 \u00a33m above the asking price \u2013 by an offshore fund in the Virgin Islands. So there is golf, \u201cdeals\u201d and a lot else to discuss. This puke-inducing diplomacy is surely what Andrew was born to do. This is the new \u201cnormal\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
