But his 10-7 defeat of John Parrott in the first round of the Embassy World Championship here at the Crucible yesterday was not one of them. \"I started badly and got worse\" was the 2000 champion's verdict on a below-par display. \"It was the most pathetic, embarrassing stuff I've ever played.\" Williams, winner of the China Open and Thailand Masters titles this season, had not been entirely convincing in claiming a 6-3 first-session lead on Tuesday as Parrott, the 1991 champion, struggled with his scoring. And when they resumed Williams won the 10th frame on the pink and extended his lead to 8-3 with a run of 48 but still did not look comfortable. Parrott then rallied to 8-6 with nothing better than a break of 51. At 9-6 Parrott constructed the highest break of the match, 79. But although Williams missed a match-ball red on 65 in the next, the Welshman eventually won it on the yellow to set up an encounter with Anthony Hamilton, the world No19 from Nottingham. Parrott had not had to qualify for the Crucible since 1986 but despite slipping to 22nd in the world rankings he still finds his competitive instincts intact. \"I love the game and I want to play,\" he said. \"There's no point if it doesn't hurt when you lose, so being the cat in my house will be an uncomfortable experience for the next couple of days.\" Hamilton, who lost the China Open final 9-8 to Williams last month after leading 8-5, completed a 10-6 victory over Dave Harold, the 15th seed, with breaks of 68, 106 and 67 in the last three frames. He had trailed 3-0 and 4-1 during the opening session but recovered to lead 5-4 entering yesterday. John Higgins, the 1998 champion, produced some of his best form against James Wattana as he took an 8-1 lead with three centuries, 109, 116 and 136 -the highest break so far - as well as runs of 62, 58 and 66."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
