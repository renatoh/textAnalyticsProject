On stage, Oedipus and Jocasta have found themselves alone and unable to resist a quickie on the conference-room floor. Lusty and impulsive, they\u2019re all over each other. When their daughter Antigone walks in on them, she has the same look of embarrassed disgust as the younger members of the audience. Eww, parents! Pretty sure none of this was in the Sophocles, but it is characteristic of Robert Icke\u2019s high-definition production \u2013 staged at the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam and coming to the Edinburgh festival \u2013 that what lies latent in the ancient Greek becomes visceral and explicit here. \u201cThis Oedipus is so compelling,\u201d says Marieke Heebink, relishing an expanded presence as Jocasta in Icke\u2019s rewritten version of the play. \u201cIt has a thriller element \u2013 you know what\u2019s going to happen but still you are hoping it won\u2019t. Even in the moment I am playing it, I think, \u2018No! No!\u2019\u201d In Icke\u2019s 21st-century reworking, Heebink assumes the role of first lady as she and Oedipus, the hopeful candidate, take refuge in the campaign HQ on the night of an election. Played by Hans Kesting, her husband is a bright and engaging alpha male with an admirable desire to do the right thing. His supporters carry placards with his face rendered in the separated colours of Shepard Fairey\u2019s famous Obama poster. His grown-up children gather for a pre-victory dinner. He even brings his mother along to enjoy the occasion. You can imagine yourself voting for him. \u201cOedipus is a guy with vision \u2013 he\u2019s the guy you want,\u201d says Icke about the man who inadvertently murders his father and sleeps with his mother. \u201cIf he\u2019s the best person for the job, do you care who they go to bed with? Does it matter what he does in his personal life? Is it of any relevance? We assume now that it does matter in a very primary way, but I wanted to interrogate that.\u201d For those who\u2019ve been following the dazzling career of the 32-year-old Icke, his collaboration with the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam seems like the fulfilment of a promise. Previously known as Toneelgroep Amsterdam, this is the artistic home of Ivo van Hove, the director to whom Icke has most commonly been compared. In his Hamlet with Andrew Scott, Mary Stuart with Lia Williams and Juliet Stevenson, and an Oresteia set in a modern-day kitchen, Icke has demonstrated a similar drive for textual clarity and an equal disdain for tradition. \u201cThe way they perform is so free,\u201d Icke says of the ensemble. \u201cIt\u2019s without hierarchy and without that strange poshness that seems to creep into British theatre and makes it feel museum-like and deadening. They are incredible actors. If Hans Kesting and Marieke Heebink acted in English, they would be massive stars.\u201d Kesting returns the compliment: \u201cIt was for him very scary because it was his first production outside Britain, with foreign actors who are used to Ivo and other big directors. But from day one, he clicked with everyone.\u201d Painstakingly translating from the original Greek, Icke wrote his version with the actors in mind. \u201cThe challenge was to provide for an audience today the impact and immediacy of the original before we all knew its twists and turns,\u201d he says. That means a production that bristles with modern-day talking points, from politicians who go off-message to the implication that Oedipus was the product of an abusive relationship (just do the maths on the ages). Throw in the campaign T-shirts, pizza boxes and political spin, and this Oedipus feels like a play for today. There will, of course, be those who question the need for a rewrite when the Sophocles version has proved durable for more than two millennia, but it\u2019s not an argument he buys. \u201cTelling any story is a process of self-discovery,\u201d Icke says. \u201cThe pretence that there\u2019s a neutral version of a play, that you could do what Sophocles intended, is so obviously ridiculous. It\u2019s exactly the same impulse that has brought us to Brexit. There\u2019s a poisonous nostalgia that says you\u2019re committing an act of vandalism if you don\u2019t do the Sophocles as Sophocles would have wanted it. To do that, I\u2019d have to do it in ancient Greek. You\u2019re not asking for the original, you\u2019re asking for a safe, culturally mandated version that has no deep relationship to the original, just to a performance tradition.\u201d He continues: \u201cThere\u2019s a horrendous possibility for exclusion in the way we talk about theatre. Theatre in Britain is so often pompous, thinking of itself as church, and I don\u2019t think that delivers a real experience to an audience. You can have a balance between a deep respect for an old text and, at the same time, an acknowledgement we\u2019re alive now and we\u2019re all in the room now.\u201d \u2022 Oedipus is at the King\u2019s Theatre, Edinburgh, 14\u201317 August, as part of the Edinburgh international festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
