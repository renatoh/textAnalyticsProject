The half-time team talk is credited by television commentators as the catalyst which has altered the course of many a game. \"Ho, ho, Trevor,\" Motty will often say. \"You have to wonder what the manager said at half-time to make his team play like this.\" In which case, what exactly did Tunoa Lui, the coach of American Samoa, find to say to his lads as they trooped into the dressing room after 45 minutes against Australia in their World Cup qualifier on Wednesday, halfway as they were towards record international defeat? \"No worries, fellas, we can easily pull back 16 goals in the second half\" would have sounded a little optimistic; \"any chance of keeping a closer eye on their centre- forward, he's already scored eight\" a little obvious; and shouting at the goalkeeper that \"a dustbin placed in the middle of the goal-line would have saved more than you\" a little harsh. Apparently the team were all Christian fundamentalists and had spent a good 30 minutes before the game praying for guidance and success. After a first half like that it was probably advisable not to bother upstairs again. Besides, the Samoans' experience with prayer will no doubt be taken as proof of the notion often bandied in the bars of Sydney, that God, at least in his sporting guise, is an Australian. Best, then, to have adopted the line used by Brian Clough - and now, we may speculate, put to good use by his disciple Martin O'Neill at Celtic. Once, after an uncharacteristically shabby performance, Nottingham Forest were trailing 2-0 at half-time. Fearing a volcanic Cloughie bollocking, the players sheepishly shuffled into the dressing room to find no sign of the great man. After five long, worrisome minutes he had still not put in an appearance. After 10, with the tea drunk and the Jaffa cakes polished off, Stuart Pearce and a couple of other senior players took charge and chivvied their team-mates as best they could. After 15 minutes, still with no sign of Cloughie, the Forest team could hear their opponents clacking down the corridor out on to the pitch and the referee stuck his head round the door to tell them it was time to return. Then, just as his players were about to depart for the fray, Clough finally appeared. \"Sorry lads, all my fault\" was all he said. \"I picked the wrong team.\" Except in Tunoa Lui's case, he should have said: \"Sorry lads, all my fault. Picked the wrong country.\" And finally... This is the last White's Week. It is customary for proper, grown-up columnists signing off for the last time to thank the many readers who have taken the trouble to write in. But frankly the news of imminent departure will come as a relief to the correspondent who wrote to suggest that, judging by the standard of my prose, long-term exposure to speculation, conjecture and wild generalisation had clearly rotted what little brain I started off with. Thanks for that, mum. I'm off to take up another role in the super soaraway Guardian sports section, whose expansion remains top secret. If you have been, thanks for reading. And if you haven't, you'll never know what you missed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
