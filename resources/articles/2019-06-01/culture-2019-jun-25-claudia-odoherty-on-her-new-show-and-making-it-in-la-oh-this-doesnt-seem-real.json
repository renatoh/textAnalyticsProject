Created by Nick Coyle, with whom O\u2019Doherty began performing as a student in university sketch group Pig Island, the series follows Sarah as she perseveres with her makeup tutorial, product haul and daily routine \u2013 despite being forced to forage for supplies \u201con the surface\u201d. She is surrounded by a grim troupe of post-apocalyptic, evolutionarily stunted humans who view her as a saviour figure, mimicking \u201clike and subscribe!\u201d \u2013 the catchcry of influencers everywhere \u2013 to earn her affection. O\u2019Doherty is intimately familiar with the mannerisms of the beauty vlogger, having procrastinated often in the depths of the YouTube algorithm. She describes what she finds there as \u201csuch a good combination of boring and compelling at the same time\u201d. Since moving to Los Angeles for a role on the Judd Apatow-produced Netflix series Love, O\u2019Doherty has become known for coupling a sweet grin and chirpy punchline with performances that can touch on sad and dark human truths. Her character on Love, Bertie, mirrored her experience as an Australian expat adjusting to a new country \u2013 although O\u2019Doherty\u2019s transition was much smoother than that. \u201cI moved to America when I got the part on Love, and so I had a very cushy situation where I was instantly introduced to people because of the job,\u201d she says. \u201cLooking for a job in Los Angeles seems like the scariest thing to do in the world.\u201d Her journey reads, on paper, like a dream scenario for any hopeful comic, as hard work collided with chance encounters to forge a career she couldn\u2019t have ever predicted. After garnering a cult comedy following with Pig Island, she created a solo show for the Melbourne Fringe festival, which led to stints overseas in Edinburgh. She moved to London in 2012, where she had a small community and a presence in the UK\u2019s alternative comedy scene. Then, as she tells it, \u201cChannel 4 over there gave me a web series.\u201d That series, in which a dry and curious O\u2019Doherty attempts to answer the question \u201cWhat is England?\u201d drew the attention of Amy Schumer. \u201cThat was the thing that started my career because people could watch it in America,\u201d O\u2019Doherty explains. \u201cAmy Schumer saw it and gave me a part in her movie.\u201d That film, 2015\u2019s comedy sensation Trainwreck, was directed by Judd Apatow, who asked her on the last day of shooting if she wanted to develop a character for a new series, which he was co-creating with writer Lesley Arfin and comic Paul Rust. \u201cI said yes, but I didn\u2019t think it was true. I went back to my house in London, which was a sharehouse full of mice. When it did happen, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was in a good mood for three years.\u201d Thanks also to appearances on shows like Comedy Bang Bang!, the Kroll Show and Conan, a global audience began to take notice. \u201cThere was no part of me that was like, \u2018This is what I deserve and this is my time to shine!\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt was very much like, \u2018Oh this doesn\u2019t seem real.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Doherty grew up in a family that encouraged her creativity. Her father is best-known by his nom de plume Reg Mombassa, a founding member of the band Mental as Anything, and the artist whose work most typified surfwear label Mambo. Her sister Lucy followed in his footsteps and is now a Brett Whiteley scholarship-winning painter. \u201cI think [his career] just made it feel very not exceptional to try to want to do a creative job,\u201d O\u2019Doherty says. But choosing comedy in Australia isn\u2019t an easy task, particularly for a woman. Before creating her first Fringe show, she recognised one of the few places for a solo performer was standup. That scene was less than appealing. \u201cIt just seemed to be 35-year-old men wearing leather jackets who were angry. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not angry, and I don\u2019t want to hang out with those people.\u2019 \u201cIt definitely felt less possible [to be a comedian in Australia] seven years ago when I moved overseas. At the time it seemed absurd to say that I was a comedian, because there was really no work.\u201d Coming back to Sydney to make Sarah\u2019s Channel, the comedy world is a little more welcoming. \u201cHaving a little bit of a profile from doing something in America has made it easier to get this made,\u201d she says. \u201cI do wonder if I\u2019d stayed in Australia if we would be able to make this show with me in it.\u201d \u2022 Sarah\u2019s Channel is now streaming on iView"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
