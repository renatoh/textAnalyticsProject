I'm in a dark place, but everyone else is thrilled", "bodyText": "Ever been to an intensive one-to-one training session with your dog? I have, last week, so I can tell you that it is a horrid ordeal. One's life and personality are investigated and found wanting. Why does darling, cuddly Violet turn into a raging, pumped-up, quivering, snarling, sinewy brute the second she leaves the front door? Because of me. Me and my pandering and pampering and being a general wet, when I should have been a consistent, bossy pack-leader from the word go. In the last four weeks, Violet has bitten four dogs, bigger and bloodier mouthfuls each time. It had to stop, so I signed both of us up for a course. How mortifying it is to confess one's mistakes: allowing the two princesses (I have two boxers) on to the sofa and beds and to dribble at table, to be forever fussing and kissing the heavenly ones and sharing my snacks, to keep chatting away to them. Would they like a drinkie? A wee-wee? A squeaky or a chewy? Have they a tummy ache? Are they bored? This has all got to stop at once. No kissing, no fussing, no chatting. No walkies together (they form a vicious pack), no playing with other dogs, and get them off that sofa. For one whole month. What a ghastly prospect. What is the point of having dogs if one may not fuss or speak to them? I see a bleak future and blub at Instructor. Can I stick to these new rules? Probably not, but I must try, otherwise Violet or Lilian will take a chunk out of one dog too many and I will be thrown in the slammer. Or they will. I am in a dark place, but everyone else is thrilled. No more slobbering, ankle-scratching, whingeing, attention-seeking and leg-bonking dogs when they visit. \"About time, too,\" says Fielding harshly. He has always been fairly nauseated by my dog relationship. \"Those dogs are like Paris Hilton. They have never heard the word 'no'.\" My mother, too, would have rejoiced, had she only lived long enough to see the dogs demoted. \"It's the dogs first,\" she would moan bitterly, \"and always me last.\" And Daughter is in heaven, because I must buy a new bed. No more sleeping on a mattress on the floor with the princesses up on the sofa. For months the mattress has distressed her. \"Mum,\" she has often cried in despair, \"you cannot live like this. It looks like a hippy squat.\" Now her wish has come true. I must sleep on a grown-up bed, or upstairs, high above the princesses. But why can I not be an adoring dog slave on a hippy mattress if I so wish? What is the point of living alone if I still may not do as I please? I have now stuck to this brutal new regime for five miserable days - an eternity. Twenty-five days to go, but that's just the beginning. How long before my dogs are transformed? \"How long is a piece of string?\" asks Instructor. It had better not be too long. Watch this space. Delia is making a comeback. Five years ago she gave up TV cooking for ever, but now she is about to return to our screens with a show based on her book How to Cheat At Cooking, written 36 years ago. Fabulous news. I like to know how to boil an egg, make a cheese sauce and roast a joint. And at the front of my copy of darling Delia's Complete Cookery Course is a conversion chart - vital for persons like me from the last century, who still haven't got to grips with the metric system. For me, Delia is a godsend. I'm even prepared to overlook the blubbing over Norwich City. Because the older I get, the more I love a simple instruction. I find that I read it, I cross the kitchen for the ingredient, and in that small space of time, the instruction and amount have left my mind. I must dash back to Delia and read it again. Any complexity would throw me into a panic. True, sometimes Delia's instructions are a teeny bit obvious. I did already know how to remove blackcurrants from their stalks, but she is spot on about summer pudding. \"Do try to get a well-made white loaf though: the texture of sliced white is most unsuitable.\" This is language from a lost world; no screaming, swearing or showing off. And I won't say what sliced white does to the bowels. Welcome back, Delia. \"Pioneering\" researchers at the Institute of Education have found that poverty affects a child's social and educational development. These disadvantaged children are already lagging behind at the age of three. I could have told them that for nothing. Your frazzled, low-paid parent on a sink estate is unlikely to be playing Mozart to her baby in the womb or feeding it organic purees in a stimulating environment. Education is a rich field for findings. \"In my line of work,\" said Fielding, a life-long teacher, \"there's a new finding on the hour.\" This week's finding, by a \"watchdog\", suggests that our children are tested too often. Tell us something else we don't know. Researchers have also recently found that people in grammar schools do better than pupils in underfinanced inner-city hell-hole comprehensives. Fielding has known that for 30 years - his lifetime spent at the chalk-face. In fact Fielding knows everything there is to know about education. He's a teacher. Go to him for cut-price findings. Why doesn't the government give experts like him the thousands of research money instead of these pointless \"pioneering researchers\"? This week Michele watched Victoria Wood's Housewife, 49: \"For the second time, and it was even better. Wonderful writing and acting. What a genius that woman is.\" Michele also watched Natural World: Rainforests for the Future on BBC2, about Gabon's attempts to protect its wildlife: \"Fantastic, but, like all wildlife programmes now, it makes me feel we've had it. I hope I'm wrong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
