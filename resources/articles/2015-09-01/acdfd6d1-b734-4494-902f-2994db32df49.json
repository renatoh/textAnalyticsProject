Collect Records said it was \u201cupset on every level\u201d to learn that Martin Shkreli, the boss of pharmaceutical company Turing who is a fan of punk and emo music and a supportive investor in the label, had acquired overnight notoriety for increasing the cost of Daraprim from $13.50 per tablet to $750 (\u00a3490). Daraprim, which was bought by Turing in August, is the standard treatment for the blood infection toxoplasmosis and is a drug many patients have to take daily for a year or more. The owner of Collect Records, musician Geoff Rickly, told the music website Pitchfork that he was heartbroken by Shkreli\u2019s actions. Rickly, the singer in No Devotion, the group he formed with the former members of Welsh band Lostprophets, said: \u201cI want to believe that Martin wants to do the right thing overall. I\u2019ve seen the guy give away money to schools, charities, and frankly, our bands, who if anyone really knows the industry, is a hard sell. I am struggling to find how this is OK.\u201d He added: \u201cThough I want to believe there is some reason he would do this that is some remotely positive way, the only thing I can see is that it is totally and completely heartbreaking.\u201d Individual acts on the label \u2013 Nothing and Sick Feeling \u2013 had already said they would not have anything to do with Collect so long as Shkreli was involved. Shkreli, 32, has faced intense pressure, including criticism from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, after he bought the US rights to the drug in August and then announced plans to raise the price. Rickly said Collect had decided to \u201cfully sever\u201d its relationship with Shkreli. \u201cWhen I decided to get into business with Martin, we took him on as a patron,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was completely silent and allowed us to do business as we pleased. His only ask was that we sign bands we believed could make great art given the right environment and not to focus on a profit, no matter how dire the bottom line.\u201d He added: \u201cNever in a million years did any of us expect to wake up to the news of the scandal that he is now involved in. It blindsided and upset us on every level. As such, we know it is impossible for us to continue having any ties with him. For my part, I\u2019ve always strived to make Collect a place that was so liberal, encouraging, and artist-friendly that no one would ever walk away from us willingly, though to do so at any time would be very easy.\u201d Shkreli has since announced he will lower the price of Daraprim, but has declined to say by how much. \u201cWe might have to curtail research for several lethal diseases that we are seeking treatments for. We might have to fire people,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe have to do a lot of calculation. When we make the new price, we are going to make it so that Turing is a break-even or only slightly profitable company,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
