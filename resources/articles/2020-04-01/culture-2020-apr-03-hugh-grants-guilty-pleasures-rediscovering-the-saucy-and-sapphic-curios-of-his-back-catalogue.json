He\u2019s given the blue bird to Boris Johnson (an \u201cover-promoted rubber bath toy\u201d leading a \u201cgang of masturbatory prefects\u201d); reminded Piers Morgan that his paper hacked actor Nigel Havers\u2019 phone while his wife was dying of cancer; and posted his own mugshot when trolls attempted to wind him up about his 1995 arrest for receiving oral sex from a sex worker. Given this glorious renaissance, it seemed like a good time to further cement the cult of Hugh and unearth three streamable \u2013 and coincidentally rather softcore and Sapphic \u2013 curios from his back catalogue. The Lair of the White Worm (1988) This camp horror was directed by Ken Russell (Tommy, Women in Love) with a smirkingly wooden script. Grant plays James, a toff whose ancestors \u2013 legend has it \u2013 had run-ins with a mythical white worm. As Peter Walker wrote of Grant\u2019s performance in the Guardian\u2019s My Guilty Pleasure series, \u201cI fancy you can sometimes see a flash of panic in his eyes, as if he\u2019s wondering if a 2:1 from Oxford should really lead to this,\u201d but still, he\u2019s one of the few actors here not struggling with his accent. Grant is pitted against Amanda Donohoe\u2019s Lady Silvia Marsh, dominatrix head of a serpent cult, who delivers her lines with all the vocal relish of Vincent Price, even when topless or when fellating a Boy Scout to death in a Jacuzzi. In a 1999 interview with The AV Club, Grant recalled that Russell would slur: \u2018\u201cDo it how I showed you, you fuckin\u2019 cunt!\u2019 Which is not classic Ingmar Bergman direction.\u201d Ah, but dream sequences, saxophone, strap-ons \u2013 this film\u2019s got it all. Buy or rent The Lair of the White Worm on YouTube Bitter Moon (1992) Before we proceed, you should know that this erotic thriller is both set on a cruise ship and directed by Roman Polanski. Grant plays Nigel, an out-of-touch toff who has a tendency to make Prince Philip-style faux pas. He\u2019s in a buttoned-up relationship with Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), and it\u2019s pushed to its limits when he meets bitter drunk Oscar (Peter Coyote), who\u2019s keen to ply Nigel with whisky and bend his ear about his sexually and emotionally sadistic relationship with young French dancer, Mimi, played by Emmanuelle Seigner (who is Polanski\u2019s wife). At first, Nigel is far too British to want to know the coarser details, but before too long, he too is obsessed by Mimi and the twisted role-reversal that occurs in this Parisian affair. Unapologetically melodramatic, Bitter Moon climaxes with a scene scored by Bryan Ferry\u2019s Slave to Love. Buy or rent Bitter Moon on YouTube Sirens (1994) Grant is Tony, a progressive English reverend sent to the Blue Mountains with his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) to take to task artist Norman Lindsay (yes that Norman Lindsay, played by Sam Neill) for his profane paintings. Once sequestered at the artist\u2019s estate and introduced to his witchy trio of sultry muses \u2013 played by Portia de Rossi, Elle Macpherson and Kate Fischer \u2013 Tony and Estella start to feel some distinctly un-British stirrings. Grant seems in his element here; both able to stammer and go red on cue and work with his own dry sense of humour. Much of the joy of Sirens, though, is director John Duigan\u2019s delight in rubbing quintessential Englishness up against ocker Australianness. The cast includes Ben Mendelsohn and John Polson as sheep shearers, and then-model Mark Gerber \u2013 now boss of the Oxford Art Factory \u2013 playing the blind and mute handyman everyone lusts after. Gerber tells Guardian Australia that he became Grant\u2019s drinking partner at the Fairmont Resort \u2013 which the studio had taken over \u2013 at one point going over the script to Grant\u2019s next film, Four Weddings and a Funeral, in Grant\u2019s hotel room. \u201cWe\u2019d be drinking whisky till five in the morning and I thought, my god, you must be a machine,\u201d Gerber says. \u201cMaybe he was method acting, because there was one scene where he had to act quite disheveled.\u201d Buy or rent Sirens on YouTube or watch on Amazon Prime"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
