Gus Poyet can mix them all into one. Like many, Poyet has been watching Sunderland \u2018Til I Die, the documentary about the club he managed for 18 months until March 2015. The first series focused on the 2017-18 season when they were relegated from the second tier. Poyet was vocal during his tenure about the issues he saw at the club and feels his opinions have now been justified. \u201cThe first series was very special, as it touched me a lot as I was there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was my office, that was my life. I was there first thing in the morning and leaving the training ground at five or 6pm. I was one of the few, and I am not putting myself in a special place, who managed the club while living in the city. \u201cIt was sad to see so many people I worked with that were still there and it was tough for me to watch. The second series shows a different side of the story of the new owners. They wanted to change things in a very strong, aggressive manner and certain things they were complaining had been done by people before, they ended up doing themselves. It just shows you that it is easy to talk about something you are not in and it shows what goes on behind the manager, letting people know how it isn\u2019t his responsibility. At the end, though, it ends up being the manager\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Brutal honesty is part of the package when hiring Poyet as a manager, with the 52-year-old having seen how cut-throat football can be. His manner is designed to improve his club but the hierarchy do not always welcome it. At Sunderland he performed one of the greatest Premier League escape acts to stay up in 2014. \u201cWhen I went to Sunderland, the owners and the fans asked for two things: one, to stay up and two, beat Newcastle. The rest, I swear to God, does not matter. Somehow we did the miracle \u2013 and it will be remembered as a miracle \u2013 to stay up. Six games to go we were seven points from safety and we were playing Chelsea, Man City and Man United, so it was a miracle. \u201cIn my time we played Newcastle three times and beat them three times, twice at St James\u2019 Park. Then it depends how you analyse what success is. People say to me: \u2018You had a tough time.\u2019 Yes. \u2018You got sacked because the team was bad and close to relegation.\u2019 Yes. But what did you ask me to do? What was my goal? Save the team and beat Newcastle. Without saying that we went to Wembley for the first time in 20 years, we lost the Carling Cup to Man City, but I think we did our job and I was easily accused of saying things that now people watching the series, they will think back: \u2018Oh, Gus had a point.\u2019\u201d There are numerous clubs on Poyet\u2019s CV that would make for intriguing documentaries, the former midfielder also having managed in Spain, France, China and Greece. A year at AEK Athens gave him situations he had not dealt with before; even without a TV crew following the team the walls had ears. \u201cFor two months I was talking freely in the dressing room and in meetings inside the club and most of it was coming out in the press, which is normal in Greece. You don\u2019t know as you don\u2019t speak the language, so don\u2019t read the newspapers. It was just before Christmas and I was thinking: \u2018Wow! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019 [They said:] \u2018As here it is normal.\u2019 It was part of life.\u201d The Uruguayan has plenty to look back on fondly from his playing and managerial career but has often lacked time to reminisce. When Spanish TV filled its schedule by replaying the 1995 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final, a WhatsApp group of former Real Zaragoza players lit up Poyet\u2019s phone as they watched it back in full together, reminding themselves of the forgotten moments overshadowed by Nayim\u2019s dramatic winner against Arsenal. Poyet was also part of a Chelsea team including Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf who won an FA Cup, Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and Uefa Super Cup. However they never secured the title and Poyet explains why. \u201cI think we were a team that played great football, it was beautiful to watch and to become champions you have to win games in an ugly way, whatever it takes to get three points on the table. We were not that team. We were a team who really made people enjoy watching us and that meant we needed to play well to win games. \u201cWe were missing that consistency of champions, of having a bad spell [but still winning]. Manchester United won the league many years with many 1-0 wins and last-minute goals. Even this Liverpool team for the last three months have played at 50% of their possibilities and still won games, which is a sign of champions. We were not that team.\u201d Since leaving Bordeaux in 2018 Poyet has had opportunities to return to management but is yet to find the perfect role, and the season\u2019s suspension means managers are not being sacked. \u201cI am still waiting and talking to people. Abroad is easier as football is worldwide and I can go anywhere in the world. My aim was to come back to England, as after I left Sunderland I wanted to go somewhere to open my mind and come back. It\u2019s taken a little bit longer than expected to come back but that is football. Now it is a little more difficult to come back here in England.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
