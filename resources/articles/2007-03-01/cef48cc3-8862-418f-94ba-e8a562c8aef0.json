One of the party's leaders has even gone so far as to warn of \"rebellion, war\". Zimbabweans have been here before, and been disappointed. So the coming weeks will be a crucial test of whether the MDC is finally able to capitalise on the unexpected transformation of its image from weak to heroic and mobilise popular resistance to Mr Mugabe's 27 year rule. Five years ago, the MDC ecstatically declared that the voters were about to turf out Zimbabwe's president. The opposition then watched helplessly as the ruling Zanu-PF stole the election. In the following days the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, backed away from confrontation with the government just as Zanu-PF most vulnerable and ordinary Zimbabweans were still mobilised. He said he did not want to see bloodshed. Since then the MDC has been on the retreat as it failed to find a strategy to confront the Zanu-PF. Mr Tsvangirai launched a \"final push\" and \"winter of social discontent\" but they failed to get an increasingly sceptical population on to the streets. The collapse in confidence in the MDC showed as many of opposition supporters did not even bother to vote in parliamentary elections and the MDC split over Mr Tsvangirai's hesitant and weak leadership. Now his party is again presented with an opportunity after the assault on the MDC leaders laid bare the brutalities of Mr Mugabe's rule, garnering reverential accounts of Mr Tsvangirai on the BBC and prompting Washington to lead international condemnation of Zimbabwe's ruler. The MDC said it would seize the moment. Arthur Mutambara, a leader of the faction that broke away from Mr Tsvangirai two years ago, declared that the party was putting aside the divisions to rally to the cause. \"We have our differences but we will manage them,\" he said. \"We are in the final stages of the final push. We are going to do it by democratic means, by being arrested, beaten, but we are going to do it. We are continuing with defiance in spite of what Robert Mugabe says. We are talking about rebellion; war.\" But at the weekend, Mr Tsvangirai was still talking about foreign intervention as key to forcing Mr Mugabe from power. Asked shortly before he was beaten up why he did not offer more forceful leadership, Mr Tsvangirai essentially said that it was for the people to lead and him to follow. But ordinary Zimbabweans have not shown any taste for mass confrontation with the government even as they have endured a collapsing economy, rampant inflation, mass unemployment and food shortages. David Coltart, an MDC MP who supports the Mutambara faction, said he remains doubtful that his party can mobilise large scale protests. \"For all the publicity of the past week, the fact remains that the opposition hasn't been able to mobilise tens of thousands of people which is partly to do with fear, partly to do with divisions in the opposition and partly to do with a shocking lack of information for ordinary people about what is going on,\" he said. \"This is a very weak population; weak economically, unhealthy because of Aids, and a population that is starving.\" Mr Coltart said the departure of about 3m Zimbabweans from their country, about two-thirds of the workforce, to South Africa and beyond in search of jobs has relieved some of the potential pressure on the government. \"I've seen it in the MDC. Young people hit by economic collapse have left the country. Without them here to form this critical mass it's hard to see how one builds the pressure,\" he said. The one MDC strategy that may yet pay off is the quiet negotiation between its two factions and rival wings of Zanu-PF. Mr Tsvangirai has tacitly acknowledged that his chances of winning an election in the near future are dim and that the best way to encourage change is through a powersharing agreement with those in the ruling party who realise that a coalition government would also ensure a future for Zanu-PF. But Mr Mugabe's critics in his party acknowledge that an opposition able to mobilise popular discontent would strengthen their hand in trying to get Zimbabwe's president to finally relinquish power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
