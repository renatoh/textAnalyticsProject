PayPal's records showed I had logged into my account the day before to change the details and security questions. I hadn't. PayPal couldn't tell me which of my details had been used by the \"spoofer\" to verify my identity and said there could have been a system glitch that made my account temporarily insecure. I asked for the result of its investigation but heard nothing. SJU, London PayPal found this fraudster had used the password recovery tool to reset your password and security questions. You replied to the confirmation email PayPal sent before damage was done. It says the person who accessed your account must know your credit card number and PayPal password as it can find no evidence that its system was compromised nor any glitches. I am pleased that, instead of blaming you for being careless, it suspects the person obtained these details by \"scraping\" the information from your computer with data-stealing software (spyware). This is one of the main ways crooks obtain identity information. Make sure you have up to date anti-virus, anti-spyware and a firewall. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
