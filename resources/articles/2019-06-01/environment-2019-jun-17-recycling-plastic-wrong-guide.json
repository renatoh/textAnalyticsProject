Recyclers call this aspirational recycling, or wish-cycling. While recycling continues to be an essential tool for dealing with the flood of plastic inundating the planet, it\u2019s time for a reality check. 1. Your coffee cup probably isn\u2019t recyclable Items composed of different kinds of materials present a big challenge for recyclers. The billions of single-use coffee cups discarded each year are a classic example: a thin, plastic coating inside the cup may prevent leakage, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to separate it from the paper cup itself. That means the cups can\u2019t be recycled as paper, nor can they be recycled as plastic. Their ultimate destination is usually the landfill. Coffee cup lids don\u2019t fare much better \u2013 due to the low quality of the plastic, they aren\u2019t particularly attractive to buyers of secondhand plastic, and in any event they tend to fragment into small, unusable pieces. Some curbside programs recommend putting them straight in the trash bin. The best solution is to get your own reusable coffee cup. 2. Toothpaste tubes need special treatment Clean teeth, yes. Clean planet, questionable. Toothpaste tubes are another troubling composite: while the bulk of the tubes may be made of plastic, they can contain other materials such as a thin coating of aluminum. Tubes and toothbrushes also contain different kinds of plastics mixed together (hard handle, soft bristles), increasing the challenges of separating and processing each type individually. Most curbside programs don\u2019t accept oral care products but new schemes, such as a partnership between Colgate and Terra Cycle, are encouraging people to send in their old tubes, toothbrushes and floss containers for proper processing. Metal tubes, glass jars and tins of toothpaste are more widely recyclable than their plastic counterparts, and plastic-free, compostable bamboo toothbrushes are becoming increasingly popular. 3. Don\u2019t be fooled by food containers It\u2019s bad enough that fruit and vegetables, which come pre-packaged in their own nutritious skins, are sold in plastic containers. What\u2019s worse is that the flimsy \u201cclamshells\u201d they often come in are low quality and made of different kinds of plastics \u2013 the container must be firm while the hinge must be soft \u2013 and thus are poor candidates for recycling in the US. This applies to takeout containers, too. In general, plastic bottles labeled with the recycling numbers 1 and 2, including items such as soda, water bottles and milk jugs, are accepted across the US, says Mitch Hedlund, the founder of the not-for-profit Recycle Across America. \u201cAny empty plastic bottles with a neck and screw on cap are recyclable,\u201d she said. Beyond that it\u2019s less assured, and you should check with your local recycling facility. She suggests keeping strawberry containers and other flimsy clamshells out of your curbside recycling unless your local provider accepts them. 4. Yes, your recycling needs to be cleaned If you assume that a magical person at a recycling plant is washing out your jar of crusty tomato sauce or scrubbing last night\u2019s takeout containers, think again. Recycling facilities typically do not clean recycling before processing it, so if you don\u2019t you may be creating an even bigger problem. Most US recycling programs are \u201csingle stream\u201d, meaning all household recycling (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass) goes into the same bin. A plastic container filled with food, soda or leftover shampoo could leak and contaminate an entire batch of perfectly good recyclables, rendering everything junk. \u201cFood waste is definitely a contaminant that can make other items dirty and attract pests,\u201d says Marissa Begley, of Millennium Recycling, a recycler in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. While recyclers say your items don\u2019t have to be squeaky clean, dirty items will benefit from a quick rinse or removal of excess food and liquids. \u201cThis could mean simply scraping out a peanut butter jar with a spatula,\u201d says Begley. \u201cWe definitely appreciate it.\u201d 5. Plastic bags are a recycling plant\u2019s nightmare Despite single-use plastic bag bans in California and New York, and rising awareness of their harm, many still find their way into the recycling system. Hedlund, of Recycle Across America, calls them the worst culprit of wish-cycling because of the damage they cause at the recycling plant. Flimsy plastic bags quickly degrade and can clog up expensive sorting equipment, causing delays and endangering workers. \u201cOften recycling centers\u2019 multimillion-dollar processing machines have to shut down every half-hour because the plastic bags get jammed into the equipment,\u201d Hedlund says. Plastic bags should be kept away from curbside recycling unless your local recycler advises otherwise, and definitely don\u2019t use them to bag up your other plastics or line your recycling bin, she says. 6. Those little arrows? They don\u2019t mean anything Time for a big debunk. Many people believe this instantly recognizable triangle icon indicates that an item is recyclable, or that it is made from recycled materials. Actually, what is known as the \u201cchasing arrows\u201d icon is \u201cessentially clip-art\u201d, explains Hedlund. \u201cThere is no oversight for how the recycling icon is used. As a result, it is often misused on packaging to make it look like something is recyclable, when in fact it\u2019s not. This misleads the consumer and causes them to throw that packaging in with the real recyclables.\u201d The symbol emerged in 1970 to honor the first Earth Day. The M\u00f6bius-strip inspired design is now in the public domain, meaning anyone can use it for any purpose. The numbers inside the arrows, from one to seven, were developed by the plastic industry in the late 1980s. Misleadingly, not every number is recyclable. In fact, hard plastics with the numbers 1 and 2, such as soda, shampoo, and laundry detergent bottles, have the most consistent recycling markets. Numbers three through seven include a lot of the soft plastics mentioned above \u2013 clamshell containers, coffee cup lids \u2013 and present greater difficulty. 7. Plastic can\u2019t be recycled forever Recycling conjures up an image of a closed circle. Yet \u201cone of the biggest misconceptions about plastic is assuming that it can be recycled into the same kind of object\u201d, says Kim De Wolff, a professor of environmental philosophy at the University of North Texas. Beverage companies tend to use only a small amount of recycled plastic in their new bottles (if any), because unlike virgin plastic, 100% recycled plastic is not translucent. More likely, your plastic bottle is being turned into an item of lesser value, such as plastic lumber, carpets or a fleece sweatshirt. Plastic degrades in quality when it is recycled, and while it\u2019s tough to know how many times a piece of plastic will get recycled before becoming unusable, experts estimate it may only be once or twice. After that, it is landfilled, incinerated, or ends up in the environment. There\u2019s only one real solution, these experts say: make and consume less plastic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
