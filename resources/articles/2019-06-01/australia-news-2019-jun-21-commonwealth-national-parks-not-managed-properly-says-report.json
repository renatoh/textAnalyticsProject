In a report released on Friday, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) said the director of national parks had failed to meet benchmarks set by auditors to probe the agency\u2019s management of some of the nation\u2019s most precious land. The audit found the director had no \u201crobust\u201d way of knowing that park management and operational plans were being implemented. The agency\u2019s work within the six parks was also \u201cnot effectively measured, monitored and reported on\u201d. Among the seven recommendations, which were accepted by the agency, the auditors said a review was required to ensure the director of national parks was \u201cmeeting the requirements of the EPBC [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation] Act\u201d. \u201cThe director does not effectively manage risks to the objectives of the parks,\u201d the report said. Under the EPBC Act, the agency is tasked with conserving and managing biodiversity and cultural heritage of 2.1 million hectares across three mainland and three island national parks (Christmas Island, Norfolk Island and Pulu Keeling). It must establish a 10-year park management plans to protect the sites, benefit traditional owners and enhance their value as tourism destinations. Three of the mainland parks \u2013 Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu as well as Booderee \u2013 are jointly managed by the director of national parks and traditional owners. But the agency had not established \u201cconstructive relationships with traditional owners at the jointly managed national parks\u201d, the report said. In one case study, eight green parrots died in a translocation project after they transferred from Phillip Island to Norfolk Island. While the parrots were moved in early April 2017 and had died by the end of June 2017, key bureaucrats were not told of any issues until August. Even then, the project\u2019s status was only changed to \u201camber\u201d and a report on the deaths was not filed until November. While the director had established five-year climate change strategies for the six parks, they had expired in 2017. \u201cThere has been no specific climate change plan or strategy in place since 2017,\u201d the report said. The director\u2019s policies suggests \u201chigh risk\u201d corrective action tasks should be completed within seven days, yet at Kakudu alone there were 26 outstanding tasks dating back to September or December 2016. There were similar findings at Uluru-Kata Tjuta. In another case study, the report said Kakudu\u2019s executive board did not receive warnings about \u201cdiesel \u2026 being released to the environment through a leaking bowser\u201d . \u201cThis is of great concern given the location of these facilities within parks that are world-heritage listed for their environmental values,\u201d an internal report said. Yet internal documents appeared to claim the issue was resolved before it had actually been dealt with. Lyndon Schneiders, the national director at the Wilderness Society, said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d the audit office had \u201cfound a range of deep and systemic problems\u201d. But he was reluctant to blame the director of national parks, arguing the federal government had \u201clargely washed its hands of looking after national parks and protected areas\u201d. \u201cWe need a completely new system where the government takes responsibility of our national parks,\u201d he said. The director of national parks accepted the audit\u2019s seven recommendations, which called for a review of its internal processes. \u201cThe director is committed to continuous improvement in the delivery against legislative and related objectives for commonwealth national park management,\u201d it said. \u201cWorking in partnership with traditional owners, improving the governance and performance of the joint boards of management for Kakadu, Booderee and Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa national parks will be a particular and ongoing focus.\u201d Auditors reviewed internal documents, observed fieldwork and interviewed departmental staff, traditional owners and board members from the jointly managed parks, the report said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
