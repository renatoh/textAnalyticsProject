The five-year-old fractured a bone in his right hind leg whilst exercising ahead of an intended outing next weekend. \"He came back fine from [his] workout,\" said New York-based trainer Kiaran McLaughlin, \"but he took a couple of funny steps and we noticed some swelling.\" Invasor won 11 of his 12 races, including last year's Breeders' Cup Classic and the Dubai World Cup in March. His only defeat came in last year's UAE Derby in Dubai . He will now stand at the Kentucky stud of his owner, Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum. Kieren Fallon enjoyed his first Group One victory since returning from a six-month drugs ban when winning the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud on Mountain High yesterday. Less than three weeks since making his comeback, Fallon punched Sir Michael Stoute's charge home ahead of the odds-on favourite Mandesha. The 42-year-old, who has been champion jockey six times, remains banned from riding in Britain ahead of his September trial for conspiracy to defraud punters, but the French and Irish authorities have decided not to reciprocate that ban.

Fitted with a first-time visor that day, he finished strongly behind two subsequent winners and can reward each-way supporters here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
