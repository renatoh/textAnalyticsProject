Two months ago Mr Duncan Smith lost shadow cabinet member John Bercow after imposing a three-line whip on the gay adoption vote, and appeared to be on the verge of resignation before issuing his desperate plea to the party to \"unite or die\". But today he said the controversial section 28 of the Local Government Act, which bans the promotion of homosexuality in schools, was a \"totally different issue\" from that which provoked the row. However, while offering a free vote on the issue, the Tories have also tabled their own amendment allowing parents to vote on what sort of sex education their children will receive - with possibly as few as 5% then having a veto on teaching materials. Despite that apparent muddle, the compromise of an amendment and a free vote - eeked out by Tory party chairman David Davis last night - today received the backing of Mr Bercow. He called the amendment a \"half-way house\", but welcomed the move as defusing a \"poiticaly explosive\" issue. \"Section 28 itself is offensive and redundant. It has never been used,\" Mr Bercow told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme. \"It has caused grave offence to hundreds of thousands if not millions of people precisely because it is gratuitously offensive and completely redundant. It should immediately be scrapped. \"That is my own position and I have signed a cross-party amendment to that effect. \"But I recognise there are other colleagues who might take a different view and in so far as David Davis on behalf of the Conservative party is seeking to defuse a politically explosive issue that is welcome. Mr Duncan Smith said the free vote offered to MPs was not intended to show his party's modernising credentials and said he had always envisaged allowing members to vote freely on the issue. \"It's nothing to do with modernisation,\" he said. \"We believe in these sort of areas it's better that people express their free opinions. \"My view all along is that we would probably have a free vote. It's a wholly separate subject from the issue of adoption by unmarried couples.\" The Tories have proposed an alternative to section 28 under which schools would be required to display teaching materials for sex education classes publicly so that parents could inspect them. If a \"sufficient number\" of parents objected to the material, schools would have to ballot all parents before using them in the classroom. On a visit to St Paul's Church in Wales primary school, in Grangetown, Cardiff, Mr Duncan Smith said the proposed amendment was about devolving power to schools and parents. \"It's about giving parents and teachers control over all the literature and lessons and about protecting children by giving power back to schools and parents,\" he said. Mr Duncan Smith said he could not see a problem arising of some children missing out on sex education against their parents' wishes because their classmates' parents had won such a ballot. \"I think it's right that the majority of parents should have an influence over what is taught in schools,\" he said. The Tory proposal, backed by the shadow cabinet, seeks to give the force of law to existing government guidelines on sex and relationship education - which prohibit the stigmatising of pupils on the grounds of their sexual orientation - but also highlight the importance of marriage. That would satisfy traditionalists while removing the homophobic language of the clause objected to by modernisers, according to Mr Davis. It has been tabled in two weeks' time as an amendment to the local government bill in its committee stage. Conservative sources have said they expect their bid to replace section 28 to fail initially in the Commons, given Labour's massive majority. But they were more optimistic that a protracted battle with the Lords, who would be more likely to back their proposal, might end with the government reluctantly agreeing to a form of words close to their suggestion. Mr Duncan Smith, who is in Wales ahead of the the Welsh assembly elections in May, said he would be disappointed if the Tories fared badly at the polls, but denied that they were effectively a \"mid-term\" for the Westminster government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
