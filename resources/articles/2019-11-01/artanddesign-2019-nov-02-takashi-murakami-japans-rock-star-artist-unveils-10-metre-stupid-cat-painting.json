That is sitting in front of the computer, I have to change the colour \u2013 I need AI or something like that.\u201d We meet at the Art Gallery of NSW in front of Murakami\u2019s brand new commission: a 10-metre long painting of a giant cat, conceived by the artist but executed largely by his army of assistants just outside Tokyo. (He employs some 350 workers.) In the artwork \u2013 titled Japan Supernatural: Vertiginous After Staring at the Empty World Too Intensely, I Found Myself Trapped in the Realm of Lurking Ghosts and Monsters \u2013 Japanese folklore demons or yokai battle with samurai, bound together by the spirit of an oversized feline. Made up of 502 individual silkscreens, it is the bonkers centrepiece of the gallery\u2019s summer show Japan Supernatural and the single largest painting to ever enter its international collection. With Murakami\u2019s stamp \u2013 this is a man, after all, with 1.5 million Instagram followers \u2013 it is bound to attract the crowds. Yet Murakami himself, who mixes disarming self-deprecation with a healthy dose of self-doubt, won\u2019t be drawn into conversations about the significance of the work. \u201cYou find me, commission me, bring me here and question me,\u201d he tells a roomful of fans in a Q&amp;A talk on opening day. \u201cI make you stupid cat painting. In my head [it] is stupid, stupid thing.\u201d He lets out a big laugh. He is joking. Sort of. Born in Tokyo in 1962, Murakami is Japan\u2019s most famous art export. Dressed in cropped jeans and a rainbow-coloured top, with a gold chain around his neck adorned with his smiling flower face motif and an orange Louis Vuitton bag, he comes across as larger than life. But his manner belies serious ambition. Murakami is often compared to Andy Warhol for his love of fame, his churning factory of a studio (it operates 24/7) and his wholehearted embrace of commercialism. \u201cPeople have resistance to the idea of a group painting, especially when they ask [the question]: \u2018Which part is actually you?\u2019\u201d he insists. \u201cBut I think of myself as a movie director, with a huge number of staff working as my hands and limbs. Every single part I\u2019m micro-managing, so this is my work.\u201d Murakami is less interested, however, in talking about what the art gallery surely hopes is his new masterpiece than in his next project: the movies. \u201cThe new Star Wars movie I am in,\u201d he tells me proudly. \u201cJJ Abrams\u2019s announcement, in Japanese premiere. I came to the British studio.\u201d A Jedi, I ask? \u201cI cannot say,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut I am wearing a robe.\u201d Murakami released his debut feature film, the children\u2019s fantasy Jellyfish Eyes, in 2013. Now he is working on Jellyfish Eyes II. The project, he says, is sending him insolvent. \u201cEvery month, it looks like bankrupt. Just lose the money. Part I shows, and two days later theatre decide: finish!\u201d \u201cI understand I am a very super bad director,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe movie thing cannot get the money yet \u2013 hopefully in the future.\u201d It is hard to tell if Murakami\u2019s talk of financial ruin is real or hyperbole, designed for effect. After all, his works sell for eye-watering amounts. In 2008, his sculpture My Lonesome Cowboy, in which a blonde-haired boy masturbates, sending a lasso of creamy semen into the air, was auctioned for US$15.2m. Of it, he says: \u201cVery strange sexuality came from Japan \u2013 plus a fear of sexuality in American culture. In my head is very stupid idea. That\u2019s why I say [I\u2019m] very lucky.\u201d Murakami\u2019s new commission for the Art Gallery of NSW, too, cost seven figures. His long-standing collaboration with Louis Vuitton has also been lucrative. In 2008, in a brazen up yours to the elites \u2013 who scorn the mixing of merchandise with high art \u2013 Murakami featured a fully operating Louis Vuitton boutique as part of his artwork at the Brooklyn Museum. Justin Paton, head curator of international art at the Art Gallery of NSW, refers to his many forays into different worlds \u2013 art, fashion, branding, film \u2013 as \u201ctentacles.\u201d \u201cWhat fascinates me is the balance between how Takashi keeps madness in his method,\u201d Paton says. \u201cHe has a huge studio environment of many, many people. The metre is running the whole time, but at the same time he needs to keep the creativity going and the ideas fresh \u2026 He is keeping tabs on what is a large business and a large number of hands that need really clear direction. Not every artist can do that.\u201d Business has been helped along, of course, by his celebrity collaborations and endorsements: Murakami directed Kanye West\u2019s animated music video Good Morning; he has designed sculptures with the likes of Pharrell Williams; and his social media feed features Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber. \u201cKanye West and Kim Kardashian came into my studio and posted. Followers immediately: Boom! Exploding. This is great,\u201d he muses. Yet it is also \u201ca lot of pressure that cracks your own ego. For the industry, it\u2019s important to have these celebrities around, but for me it\u2019s both good and bad.\u201d While his place in the art world now seems secure \u2013 so secure, apparently, as to be just plain dull \u2013 it is film that makes him the most nervous. \u201cI have no confidence. The chaotic situation. In my head it is necessary to keeping fresh. I need a lot of process, I need a lot of new interest,\u201d he says. \u201cI am investing in all these new experiences and from these new experiences I get inspiration. And that\u2019s how I get to survive this long.\u201d \u2022 Japan Supernatural is open at the Art Gallery of NSW until 8 March 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
