Japanese youth groups are standard, and maybe the Thai sex industry (guilty as charged). And, of course, the laws in Singapore about what you may not do in the street or on public transport, like smoking, chewing, eating, spitting. Or indeed swallowing: I was upbraided for sipping a McDonald's coffee on the MRT train to the airport. I wasn't fined or birched, but perhaps they realised I was being shipped to Australia anyway. You do see signs that look like those old posters in the swimming baths forbidding petting, bombing and acrobatics. Before I got to Singapore I had arranged with stay4free.com to stay with Azman and his family who, like nine out of 10 Singaporeans, live in an HDB, or government flat. Most of the residents of the flats are Chinese, and the walkway and stairs were decorated for Chinese new year with red lanterns and curious spiky flower arrangements. The next door neighbour came round with a bag of the traditional oranges, two for each of the five members of Azman's family, and two for me. The Chinese Year of the Horse kicked in this week, which apparently is not a good one if you are superstitious: the newspapers are full of stories of people rushing to get married before the Year of the Snake ends. I met a bunch of Azman's friends for a Muslim dinner on New Year's Eve, then he took me down to Chinatown to see the new year high jinks. Chinatown is big anyway, but it had been extended still further into a downtown park with a funfair and a large wooden bridge which you crossed to symbolise the passage from the old year to the new. Being in Singapore for Chinese new year was a mixed blessing. New Year's Eve was a hoot, it was fantastic to see all the shops and homes all decked out. But after New Year's Eve the whole place shuts down for an extended public holiday. There were a just few sorry-looking tourists milling about, looking for something that was open. I met up with the ex-pat son of a London friend for a fantastic posh lunch at the Hyatt and hung out at the hotel pool. That was about it. When I had to pay, I relied on the hawker centres for my meals. These are huge food courts on the ground floors of shopping centres or apartment buildings: clean, but rarely air-conditioned. Locals eat out at hawker centres most nights of the week, or get takeaway. This eating out isn't because they are affluent, but because most adults work full-time and live in cramped flats with tiny kitchens. Friends and family and a couple of readers have emailed to ask if I get lonely. I do a bit, but on balance I like being a lone wolf. This came home to me when in a weak moment I joined a Singapore By Night tour aimed at older English tourists. What was I thinking? The guide was very nice, and I got to try a Singapore Sling, but the other tourists really worked my last nerve. The tour company had strategically provided the Brits with a very plain dinner: mushroom soup; grilled steak, chicken, prawns, or salmon; green salad; tiramisu. It's true that I inhale whatever is put in front of me, but from peoples' faces and the way they were pushing the food around, you'd have thought the restaurant had served up Thai trekking snacks of bamboo worms and roasted grasshoppers. When one woman's prawns arrived, she said \"No, I ordered prawns\". \"They, er... are prawns,\" I ventured. \"No, I meant prawns,\" she said, horrified, \"like in a prawn sandwich.\" Back at my hotel, losing my grip on reality, I remembered that my host in Pretoria had given me his friend Hiresh's phone number in Singapore. When I rang and introduced myself Hiresh asked what I thought of the place. \"It's a bit sterile,\" I whinged, \"and everything's closed\". \"Meet me in Starbucks at City Hall in an hour,\" he replied, adding \"or outside if it's closed.\" Obviously clued in to my needs, Hiresh took me on a whistlestop tour of the seamy underbelly of the pristine city state. We wandered down Desker Street in Little India, one of half-a-dozen red light areas in Singapore and, I imagine, the cheapest. Among the sex aids and porno VCDs I found \"Steps Gold\" for \u00a32. Hiresh should take over the franchise for the Singapore By Night tour: he showed me everything that Singapore pretends doesn't exist: cheap food, grubby streets, nightlife, homosexuals. The regulations about public behaviour do affect private life. There are laws against some sexual acts between husbands and wives, and to be lesbian or gay is to be a criminal. Living in the cramped HBD apartments, people have to socialise out of the house anyway, so of course there are places where gay men meet. One of the most fascinating is the area in front of the Mustafa Centre: super-cheap shopping centre by day, impromptu bar by night. You buy a drink at the 7-11 then hang out with your friends in the plaza to chat, do a few circuits of the plaza, and check out the talent. At first I thought it was a bit sleazy and odd, but it was fun, and where else are they supposed to go? And in this rather racially divided and tense place, it was a pleasure to see Chinese, Indians and Malays laughing, gossiping and even flirting together. Even if it is mostly about a bit of exotic sex, it's a start. If I had been in Singapore for longer, I would have seen a few films. As well as the latest Hollywood releases, the latest Indian and Chinese films are shown here with English subtitles. There has been hoo-ha over Black Hawk Down marginalising the role of Malaysian troops in Somalia, and a ding-dong over Zoolander. This rather daft Ben Stiller film has been suddenly banned in Singapore because a male model is brainwashed into assassinating the Malaysian Prime Minister. Flying Singapore Airlines to Perth at the end of my week, I mischievously asked the stewardess why I couldn't get Zoolander to work on the video-by-demand channel, even though it is featured on the front of the inflight magazine. She pretended she didn't know, and recommended the Meg Ryan film instead. Thanks very much to everyone who took the trouble to email me about the Malaysian scooter drivers wearing their shirts and jackets backwards. There were almost as many explanations as there were emails, so perhaps I should pass this one over to Notes and Queries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
