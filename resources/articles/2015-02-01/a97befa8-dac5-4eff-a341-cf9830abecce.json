Students were quick to post photos of the menu online, provoking anger that the vendor and school had juxtaposed Black History Month with foods associated with offensive racial stereotypes. \u201cI apologize to anyone hurt by the display,\u201d Hopkins wrote in an email to students. \u201cTo our credit, the menu was quickly removed. But the larger question remains: why was it done?\u201d \u201cI will find out. We will take steps to prevent this kind of behavior occurring in the future.\u201d Those steps include coordination between the dining services and the university\u2019s diversity department, Wright communications director Seth Bauguess said. Bauguess added that the office of multicultural affairs, which works with minority groups on campus, would work with the dining services. \u201cChartwells and our office of multicultural affairs are going to bounce ideas off each other,\u201d Bauguess said, \u201cso say Chartwells wants to do a themed idea for a culture \u2013 say Hispanic heritage month \u2013 they\u2019ll get feedback from the office.\u201d Bauguess said campus officials played no part in the menu, which he said was one among other such themed promotions from Chartwells. \u201cThe university was completely unaware that they planned to do this,\u201d he said. A Chartwells spokesperson did not return a call for comment but did send a statement that said: \u201cIn no way was the promotion associated with Black History Month meant to be insensitive.\u201d \u201cWe could have done a better job putting this in context of a cultural dining experience,\u201d the vendor conceded. \u201cWe sincerely apologize.\u201d Students, alumni and others have protested the menu online, criticizing Wright and expressing surprise and sadness that the school did not catch it. \u201cThis is not a mistake this is PURE ignorance,\u201d film director and alumnus Dominick Evans wrote on Twitter. \u201cSuper ashamed to be a Raider right now,\u201d he added, referring to the school\u2019s mascot. Billy Barabino, a student and member of Wright\u2019s Black Student Union, told Dayton Daily News: \u201cFor me, it was a knock in the face for African, African American individuals who have fought for us to be progressive. I was extremely offended by it because it minimizes who we are as people.\u201d Other members of the union did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Not far from where the menu hung, Wright hosted a panel on civil rights and black history that included Ilyassah Al-Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X; Reena Evers, the daughter of Medgar Evers; and Mary Liuzzo Lillieboe, the daughter of James Chaney. Hopkins, who attended that panel, said when he learned of the menu shortly afterward he \u201cunderstood clearly that despite progress we still have a long way to go\u201d. Chartwells is not the first food service to have attempted a misguided promotion or let slip an offensive menu. In 2010, the cafeteria of NBC\u2019s New York headquarters briefly offered fried chicken and collard greens \u201cin honor of Black History Month\u201d, and a year later the service that runs Citigroup\u2019s cafeteria offered \u201cquinoa crusted fried chicken, Savannah meat loaf, olive oil whipped potatoes\u201d for its \u201cBlack History Table\u201d. Earlier this month a California high school offered watermelon and fried chicken for the occasion, until upset students and parents prompted an assembly and apology from the principal. In January, an Atlantic City casino attempted to honor the birthday of Martin Luther King with a similar menu. Fried chicken has long been associated with southern culture but became attached to racial stereotypes of black people in part due to the 1915 film Birth of a Nation, a three-hour silent saga that depicts members of the Ku Klux Klan as heroes and denigrates black people throughout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
