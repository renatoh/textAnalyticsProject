Bent has scored three times against them this season and will be fresh for the challenge of reaching an FA Cup semi-final after being rested on Saturday against Everton. The 22-year-old is entering a critical period, needing to end the campaign fit and in persuasive form to try to earn a place in England's World Cup squad. Charlton are highly reliant on him for goals and his recent partial drought has coincided with the team scoring in only two of their last nine matches. Bent's enthusiasm has not waned, though, and Curbishley claims he has to \"push him back in the building\" after training. \"From the first day he came in it was like a breath of fresh air,\" the manager said. \"You had someone who came in here ready to win the running, wanting to be in the team photo, who couldn't wait for the season to start. It wasn't just another old season. We sensed that early and after working with him for a little while we realised what a great finisher he is. \"If you look at the goals they are not all in the same group. They are right foot, left foot, headers. What we've tried to do is work on the other side of him to make him a better player in some of the things he needs to do as a centre-forward for the rest of the team. I don't think we've had it since [Clive] Mendonca but we do feel if a chance arises and pops down to him he's going to finish it. When he had the Uruguay game [with England] I was so disappointed one didn't just pop down to him because I'm sure he would have finished it.\" Six of Charlton's past nine matches have ended goalless, including the initial tie against Middlesbrough, but Curbishley offers no apology for having made his team harder to beat after a miserable mid-season run as he returns to a stadium where he enjoyed a 3-0 win in August, with Bent scoring. \"It's all right sitting up in that stand saying: 'Entertain me' and 'I want to see loads of goals,'\" he said. \"We were regularly getting beaten by three goals and that was not entertaining me and I needed to do something about it. I'm sure my chairman wouldn't have thanked me if I was embroiled in a relegation battle at the moment. It's not that we've said 'Let's go out and keep clean sheets and hope we get draws.' We've never done that. \"If you look at the amount of games we have drawn then it's about average, but they've just all come at the same time,\" Curbishley added. \"The clean sheets have helped us back on track. Now that we've tightened up I want us to get back to being more fruitful in front of goal and start scoring some more.\" TV: BBC1, 8.05pm kick off"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
