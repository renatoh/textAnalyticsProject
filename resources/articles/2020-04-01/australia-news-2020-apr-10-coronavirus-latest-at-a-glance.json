There are 1,601,984 confirmed cases worldwide. Italy\u2019s death toll continues to be the world\u2019s worst, with 18,279 lives lost, while the US has the highest number of confirmed cases, with 461,437. UN chief warns coronavirus threatens global peace and security Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the UN Security Council on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic was threatening international peace and security, potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine the world\u2019s ability to fight the disease. The UN\u2019s most powerful body, which has been silent on Covid-19, issued its first brief press statement after the closed meeting, expressing \u201csupport for all efforts of the secretary general concerning the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries\u201d. One in 10 Americans have lost their jobs in three weeks More than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs in just three weeks in a measure of the economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus. Numbers released Thursday by the US government showed that 6.6 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that. That amounts to about 1 in 10 American workers losing their employment, by far the largest and fastest accumulation of job losses since the world\u2019s largest economy began keeping records in 1948. During the Great Depression it took 44 weeks \u2014 roughly 10 months \u2014 for unemployment claims to go as high as they now have in less than a month, AP reports. New York sees record coronavirus deaths again New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, the governor announced on Thursday, as he warned the pandemic would hit the state\u2019s economy harder than 9/11. New York was hiring labourers for mass burials on an island off the Bronx as it recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. There are signs that social distancing is flattening the curve, however, as the state recorded its lowest number of new hospital admissions since the crisis started. China reports fewer new cases China reported 42 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, 38 of them imported, along with one additional death in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan. That was down from 63 new cases on Wednesday, and 62 a day earlier, the national health commission said. Another 1,169 suspected cases, or those who tested positive but were not showing symptoms, were being monitored under isolation. China now has reported a total of 81,907 cases and 3,336 deaths from the virus. Daegu city, South Korea, reports zero new cases The South Korean city of Daegu, where a cluster of infections at a church drove the first major coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows. With at least 6,807 confirmed cases, Daegu accounts for more than half of South Korea\u2019s 10,450 infections. South Korea on Friday reported 27 new cases, a new low since daily cases peaked at more than 900 in late February. The death toll also rose by four to 208. Care homes across globe in spotlight over Covid-19 death rates Care homes for older people across much of Europe and North America are struggling to cope with the global coronavirus pandemic, prompting allegations of inhumane treatment and calls for high-level inquiries. Appalling stories have emerged from residential homes, which have emerged as a key location for infections. People aged 70 and older are at higher risk of getting very sick or dying from the coronavirus. And people 85 and over are even more vulnerable, global figures show. US continues its attack on WHO Days after Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the World Health Organisation, the US has doubled down on its criticism of the WHO. The state department has said the body was too late in sounding the alarm over Covid-19 and overly deferential to China. It questioned why the Geneva-based body did not pursue a lead from Taiwan and said: \u201cThe WHO once again chose politics over public health.\u201d Boris Johnson out of intensive care Boris Johnson is back on a hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care, and is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d, Downing Street has announced. In a statement released on Thursday evening, a No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
