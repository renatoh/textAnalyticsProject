Jeremy Noseda's runner needs four horses above him in the handicap to be pulled out following yesterday's five-day declaration stage and the call is so close that bookmakers Blue Square are betting on the outcome. They make Adiemus an even money shot to make the cut and 8-11 to miss out. The main talking points in the build up to the first big betting race of the Flat turf season are usually the going and the draw but this year the whole complexion of the race depends on Adiemus's participation. The 5lb penalty he picked up for his cosy short-head victory in Saturday's Winter Derby on the all-weather at Lingfield, his fourth this winter on the sand, still leaves him a stone well in according to ratings experts Timeform. He dominates the betting and is short as 11-4 with the Tote. A total of 70 horses remain in the race with the weights headed by Smirk, who may yet run in the Doncaster Mile on Thursday according to his trainer David Elsworth. I Cried For You, who finished a short-head and the same behind Adiemus and Laissezaller at Lingfield but was promoted to second following a stewards' inquiry, has been given the go-ahead. The Tote Cambridgeshire winner's trainer James Given said: \"Some of the owners were a little concerned he needed more than a mile now but when they realised he was second favourite for a \u00a375,000 race they thought that we ought to have a go. \"It could be the ideal race for him. He loves the hurly burly of a big field, he travels well and you don't often get the opportunity to run in a race like this very often with a fancied chance so we decided to have a go. We were a bit concerned after Saturday's race because he finished very tired but he seemed fine this morning.\" Paul Cole, who has won three of the last five Lincolns, has a trio of entries but is pessimistic. He said: \"The Judge won't get in, Nimello is a bit unlikely, it depends how he works on Wednesday, which leaves me with Inspector General who is a possible seven-furlong horse. \"Inspector General likes the ground but Nimello is a bit behind - not on schedule. Although it doesn't look a great race this year, we'll be struggling to win it.\" Bryan Smart, on the other hand, is hoping for a good run from Atlantic Ace - one above Adiemus in the handicap. \"He's got every chance. He's won on heavy ground and he's won on fast ground. Everything has gone great, I just hope this week goes as well and we should be all right,\" said the Lambourn trainer. Pat Eddery replaces the suspended Darryll Holland on Faithful Warrior for Barry Hills while Johnny Murtagh takes the mount on the Lambourn trainer's Calcutta. Connections of Gossamer have not entered the unbeaten filly in the Vodafone Oaks because of likely stamina limitations. The Luca Cumani-trained full-sister to Breeders' Cup Mile winner Barathea had been quoted at 8-1 by Coral for the Epsom Classic. But her owner Gerald Leigh explained: \"She might make 10 furlongs but she won't make the Oaks trip [a mile and a half]. Barathea was essentially a miler.\" Henry Cecil, who has won four of the last six runnings of the Oaks, is responsible for seven of the 94 entries revealed yesterday. \u00b7 Today's scheduled meetings at Sedgefield and Hereford are subject to 7am inspections following heavy rain while the other jump programme, Exeter, was abandoned yesterday due to waterlogging. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
