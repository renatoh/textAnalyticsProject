While defeats of this kind are hardly the stuff of crisis, especially when suffered by an England team which has had the guts torn out of it by injuries, the way in which Italy casually moved up a couple of gears to win the match once they had fallen behind provided a warning against unrealistic expectations from what is, in part, a team of World Cup apprentices. Sven-Goran Eriksson used 22 players last night yet did little more than prove how crucial the form and fitness of Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes will be in Japan. In the absence of both players England's midfield struggled to find balance and rhythm and, although Joe Cole's performance in the second half was an improvement on the collective efforts of Nicky Butt and Frank Lampard in the first, the manner in which an Italian substitute, the experienced Demetrio Albertini, took command for the last 25 minutes put this small comfort firmly into perspective. Friendlies against Italy will always suffer from a certain ennui and last night's first half was slothful beyond reason. It took Fowler's goal to bring the evening to life. Unfortunately for England it also roused the sleeping beast in the opposition as one of Giovanni Trapattoni's eight substitutions, Vincenzo Montella, first brought the scores level then won the match from the penalty spot. For coaches no international is a complete waste of time but the majority of things Eriksson may have learned from this dubious exercise will surely be negatives, although it did give David James a better chance to press his case for being regarded as the second choice in goal. Neither Emile Heskey nor Michael Owen had much joy during the 45 minutes they were on, although the unimaginative labours of England's midfield were never going to see Eriksson's main strikers at their best. This and the regularity with which the ball was given away bore echoes of the only other defeat England have suffered since the Swede took over when Holland won 2-0 at White Hart Lane last August. In the second half Butt and Lampard gave way to Danny Murphy and Owen Hargreaves, neither of whom was any more effective either in tracking down the opposition or using the ball with imagination. Presumably David Beckham will make a more effective contribution in future friendlies. The combination of a foot bruised in training and Man chester United's Champions League encounter with Deportivo La Coruna on Tuesday seemed to weigh heavily on the England captain's performance. For an hour it was difficult to be equally judgmental about the England defence since Italy were content in the main to aim sword-points at their opponents' throats without actually making a fatal thrust. Yet the ease with which Gianluca Zambrotta cut inside Wayne Bridge five minutes before half-time to draw a sharp blocking save from Martyn proved a portent for what eventually transpired. England could take some credit for reminding the Elland Road crowd that they had paid to see an international contest, not a coaching seminar. Ledley King it was who roused the game from torpor by bringing Buffon back into action after 58 minutes. Five minutes later Joe Cole's persistence led to England going in front. Although heavily beset by blue shirts the West Ham player simply refused to yield the ball, finally prodding it past Mark Iuliano's lunge to send in Fowler for a sharp shot past Buffon. Then Albertini, who had only been on for five minutes, took over. In the 64th minute Cole lost possession to Zambrotta whose pass found Albertini well placed to set up Montella for a superb shot past James from just beyond the penalty arc. At last Italy decided to play and the combination of Albertini and Montella ruled thereafter. With two minutes to go James appeared to have spared England a defeat when he scrambled a sharply angled header from Montella, following Albertini's corner, around a post. But the relief was fleeting. As the match entered stoppage time Tommasi intercepted an underhit pass from Hargreaves and slipped the ball to Montella who in turn freed Massimo Maccarone, scorer of Italy's goal in their 1-1 draw with England Under-21s the previous evening. James denied Maccarone the privilege of scoring at both levels on successive night but only by bringing him down. Montella's penalty casually sent the England goalkeeper the wrong way and it is now seven months since Eriksson last won a game, that little affair against Germany in Munich.
