They needed to improve their points difference by 25 and were well on course with a 20-2 lead at half-time only to be frustrated by some much stiffer French resistance after the break, despite Rooney's three tries and seven goals. The Catalans are now two points adrift at the bottom of the table but they cannot be relegated, making these horribly nervous times for the five clubs above them who are now separated by only three points, with Castleford and Huddersfield back in the mire. Kear believes Wakefield need two more wins from their remaining four matches to avoid the drop, meaning they will have to win at least one of their next three games against Leeds, St Helens and Bradford before a potential last-round decider at home to Castleford. That will not be easy but is a far healthier position than the club were in before his arrival three weeks ago. Leeds, whose run of five consecutive defeats is already their worst for a decade, will not be relishing the short trip to Wakefield on Friday night. Wakefield had ended last Sunday's win at Castleford with 11 men after the dismissals of Monty Betham and Ned Catic, whose respective suspensions of two and three matches meant that both were missing last night. However, this time it was the discipline of Trinity's opponents that crumbled and they, too, were down to 11, albeit temporarily, when both Gregory Mounis and Lionel Teixido were sent to the sin-bin in the space of nine minutes as the referee Steve Ganson penalised the Catalans on six separate occasions for slowing down Wakefield's play-the-ball. Jason Demetriou put Trinity ahead within a minute of Mounis's offence and by the time Teixido returned from the bin to restore the Dragons to their full complement Wakefield were 16-0 up. Demetriou, who resumed the captaincy from Betham, finished a right-wing move featuring Ben Jeffries and David Solomona. Catalans showed some spirited resistance after that but two minutes before Mounis completed his stint in the sin-bin, Ganson sent Teixido to join him. Again Trinity capitalised, with long passes from Jeffries and Rooney allowing Ryan Atkins to cross on the left. The Dragons' handling was almost as bad as their discipline and a succession of errors in the increasingly heavy rain gave Wakefield another attacking position from which Rooney stepped through some dreadful defence to score near the posts. He added a second conversion and then a couple of penalties as the Catalans found new ways to transgress - one for a high tackle, the other when they had been in possession of the ball. It was not until the closing stages of the first half that the Dragons finally mounted a worthwhile attack and it ended with the Wakefield substitute Darrell Griffin in the sin-bin and Stacey Jones opening their account with a penalty. They then cut the deficit to 20-8 with a try by Mark Hughes converted by Jones when Trinity were down to 12 men, bringing back unhappy memories for the locals of a series of second-half capitulations this season. But Rooney's third penalty provided a little more breathing space and in the 62nd minute his second try made the game safe with Sam Obst making the crucial break from acting half. Jones, the New Zealand international who probed tirelessly throughout, struggled over for a second Catalans try in the 69th minute and, although Rooney completed his hat-trick four minutes later, Wakefield fell narrowly short of their points target. Who knows how important that could prove this time next month.
