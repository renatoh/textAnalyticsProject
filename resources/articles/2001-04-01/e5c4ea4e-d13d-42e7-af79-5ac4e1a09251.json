The first touch is the sweetest, as the song almost goes. It was a cruel cut for Derby, still stuck in the relegation mire. They can only be thankful for the shortcomings of others, notably the Citys of Coventry and Leicester, the latter providing them with their only win of the month. With Manchester United and Ipswich left to play, it is hard to see them finding another point. Then again, it is hard to see those beneath them making up a deficit of four and five. 'Mildly concerned,' was the Derby manager Jim Smith's response to the situation. At least there was spirit to Derby's display as they came back to equalise Kanu's opening goal through Stefanio Eranio in added time at the end of the first half. Once Arsenal had matched them for edge and bite in the tackle - at last, away from home - class told. 'It is always good to have quality on the bench,' said Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager trying hard to suppress a smirk when complimented on his substitutions. Henry and Pires began on the bench due to their impressive midweek exertions in France's emphatic win over Portugal and at first it appeared that the forward pairing of Sylvain Wiltord and Kanu would splutter. In only the second minute Kanu over-elaborated from Wiltord's pass and allowed the admirable Mart Poom to gather. It reflected the Nigerian's meagre season and also an unease and imprecision in Arsenal's early work. But if the test of a striker is persistence through the misses, then Kanu passed. With Patrick Vieira gradually asserting authority over a Derby midfield benefitting from Craig Burley's return, space began to clear, chances began to arrive. So too a goal. Ashley Cole's penetrative run was halted by Chris Riggott, but Kanu seized on the loose ball to feed Wiltord on the left and from his low cross, Kanu had a tap-in; only his third Premiership goal of the season. More seemed sure to follow but somehow Derby summoned an equaliser in a rare attack. Burley found Giorgi Kinkladze and the little Georgian, though a shadow of former years, produced a ray of sunlight with a pass to Rory Delap, whose weaving run to the byline produced a cross which deflected off Tony Adams and on to the head of Eranio at the far post where the Italian nodded firmly past David Seaman. Derby were fired, Arsenal angry, for the second half and a fractious contest developed, yielding seven yellow cards in all, the worst tackles by Seth Johnson, yet again, on Lauren and Tony Adams on Horacio Carbonari, who fired the resulting free-kick only just wide from 25 yards. Adams might even have gone soon after clipping Malcolm Christie's heels, though it appeared accidental. Adams's first tackle was a result of a growing frustration. Thirty seconds earlier he had been snarling at his forward players for their carelessness. Finally they responded after Wenger sent for Henry and Pires. 'I didn't mention their substitutes to my team before the game,' said Smith. 'I didn't want to frighten them.' Kanu played the ball wide to Henry and he strode on in familiar fashion before crossing low. Wiltord met it, only for Poom to block the shot. Pires, though, was on hand to sidefoot home gleefully. 'I think it showed that extra motivation that all the top teams had today,' said Wenger. 'Everybody won in the last 10 minutes. For us, mentally it is important now not to fail.' Smith was left pondering the future, and Brian Clough's suggestion in a morning paper that he should join him in retirement. 'I certainly wouldn't join him,' he jovially replied. 'I might join Alex Ferguson in a year's time.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
