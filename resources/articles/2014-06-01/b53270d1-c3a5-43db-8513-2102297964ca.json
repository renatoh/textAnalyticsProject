The naysayers have rounded on Pinto and his players ever since the draw was made and the press conference here was dominated by questions that related to the inferiority complex that Costa Rica were supposed to feel; how they surely could not fashion another lightning strike. The 3-1 win over Uruguay, which was marked by an electric second-half comeback, has not entirely altered the narrative. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was held up as one of the doubters and the Chelsea manager\u2019s prediction was relayed to Pinto. Mourinho had said that after springing \u201cthe big surprise\u201d against Uruguay, it would be \u201cdifficult for Costa Rica to make another one\u201d. Joel Campbell, the Costa Rica striker, Mourinho continued, was \u201cno longer new\u201d; ditto the tactical system. Those comments might have hurt Pinto, who admires Mourinho greatly and seeks to ape many of his methods, particularly those that involve meticulous preparation. Yet the sniping from all corners merely fortifies him. Time and again, the Colombian punched back. If Pinto\u2019s players prove as defiant as him, Italy will have a problem. \u201cI am really surprised that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said something like that,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cHe plays Sundays and Wednesdays and he is not able to repeat what he did the match before? Of course he is. We know that Italy is a very difficult opponent but we are confident that we will be able to repeat our performance.\u201d Pinto went on. \u201cAt the beginning, some people said that we were the worst and that we wouldn\u2019t even get one point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we think about what we are able to do. Other people said that Spain would play the final against Brazil. That will not happen now. \u201cYes, we are in the \u2018group of death\u2019 and that\u2019s because the four of us are really good. We are thinking about ourselves and what we can do, how we can improve our tactics, our play with the ball, our transitions and our mistakes from the Uruguay game. That is all.\u201d The defender Giancarlo Gonz\u00e1lez warmed to the theme. \u201cEverybody knows that many of us were not known before this World Cup but the Uruguay game was a good introduction for us to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe some people still don\u2019t know us but against Italy, we will let the world know we are here. When I am on the field, I don\u2019t care about who I play. I just play.\u201d Pinto said that he was engaged in a \u201cgame of poker\u201d with his Italy counterpart, Cesare Prandelli, over the concealment of the starting line-ups but it would be a surprise if he did not stick with the one that beat Uruguay, with five defenders and four midfielders. Campbell is expected to remain as the lone striker. Costa Rica will seek to plunder on speedy counterattacks and from set-pieces. Pinto insisted that he had a Plan B but there was also an admission, a clue. \u201cWe would like it to work out with the system we have tried,\u201d he said. There was actually another admission, one that revealed his wariness of Italy\u2019s star players, most notably the playmaker Andrea Pirlo. \u201cI have studied Pirlo since 2006, when he was the best player at the World Cup,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cWe will have to block him because he is the Italy player that thinks the most.\u201d Costa Rica believe that glory beckons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
