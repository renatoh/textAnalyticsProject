Under the terms of the APS, the government's toxic debt insurance plan, the Edinburgh-based bank would be required to pay a fee of \u00a319.5bn that would largely be paid through an issue of B shares. These B shares would go to the government but do not carry voting rights. Hester, who was parachuted into RBS as chief executive last October during the unprecedented bank bailout, is asking investors whether they would be prepared to support a cash call to help reduce the number of B shares that would be issued to the government. But, unlike his counterpart at Lloyds Banking Group, Hester is not trying to wriggle out of the APS altogether. Eric Daniels, the Lloyds chief executive, is hoping to prove to the Financial Services Authority that he has a plan to find \u00a325bn of extra capital to allow the bank to exit the APS entirely. The rise in the share price of RBS to more than 55p has encouraged Hester to test the appetite for further equity among investors during routine meetings with the major holders of the shares. He has made clear that there could be \"fine tuning\" rather than dramatic changes to the insurance. UK Financial Investments, which looks after taxpayer stakes in the banks, already owns 70% of RBS and could end up with more than 90% in certain circumstances. If traditional City investors are prepared to top up their existing holdings, it would allow RBS to restrict the number of shares that the taxpayer would be forced to buy. Hester's conversations with investors are tentative and no decision has yet been made about whether such a cash call is feasible. RBS has agreed to insure about \u00a3300bn of troublesome loans with the government. The RBS chief executive is meeting his investors at the same time that the Lloyds chief executive is also hoping to tap City investors for fresh funds. Daniels is understood to be telling investors that he believes Lloyds can survive without extra capital but has been told by the FSA that he needs to find \u00a325bn or more to rebuild the bank if he wants to avoid taking out the government's APS insurance to cover \u00a3260bn of troublesome loans. One of the central planks of his plan is to convert \u00a37bn of preference shares into equity that could be considered by the FSA as counting towards its capital cushion. This might be done through intricate financial engineering. Asset disposals are also possible, along with a cash call of about \u00a36bn. A partial exit from the APS is believed to be more likely than a total withdrawal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
