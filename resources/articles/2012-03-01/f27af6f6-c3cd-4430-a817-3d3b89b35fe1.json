David Cameron and George Osborne are taking us straight back to the 1980s. If the leaks of the past few days are correct, Wednesday's budget is going to cut the top rate of tax for the richest 1%, while the minimum wage is reduced in real terms and public sector pay is hacked back in the poorest regions. The class priorities really couldn't be clearer. Just as in 1979 and 1988, a Tory chancellor is prepared to court serious unpopularity to attend to the core interests of the party's most privileged supporters, while cuts in real pay, benefits, tax credits and unemployment drive down living standards for the majority. It's a combination that reflects the classic conservative fallacy: economic incentives only work by increasing rewards at the top end and by reducing them at the bottom. But the difference this time round is that the Tories are cutting a popular tax on the rich with Liberal Democrat cover. Of course, Osborne and Nick Clegg insist that by cracking down on tax avoidance, the wealthy will end up paying more. But if the 50% tax doesn't bring in significant revenue, then it can't be the disincentive to enterprise Conservatives claim \u2013 while more serious tax collection might be. In reality, if it hadn't been having any impact, the Tories wouldn't be gagging to get rid of it. Meanwhile, to add to the budget's retro feel, the government has been gripped by a new asset-stripping frenzy. The health service, schools, postal service, police and now roads are all up for sale, outsourcing and corporate cherry-picking. The solution to every problem turns out, like a broken record, to be privatisation. Nothing, it seems, has been learned from the failure of an economic model that brought us to the brink of breakdown. For the urbane ideologues now running the show, this crisis has become a ready-made opportunity to shrink the state, shock-doctrine style, and hand over yet more ready-made markets to corporate monopolies. Roads and other infrastructure projects are the latest candidates to \"leverage\" private investment the state can't afford: except that the existing \u00a353bn worth of such private finance initiative schemes are expected to cost the state \u00a320bn-\u00a325bn more than if it had funded them directly. Crucially, none of what Osborne announces on Wednesday is going to kick-start an economy that is at best flatlining, stifled by cuts, starved of investment and consumer demand, and at risk of further debilitating shocks. And the evidence of the past 30 years is clear enough: any idea that cuts in corporation taxes or the top rate of income tax are going to deliver an investment revival without the prospect of renewed growth is trickle-down fantasy. Escape from economic stagnation would instead need a serious boost to public investment and consumer demand, mobilisation of the state-dominated banks to drive recovery, and intervention to rebuild an economy hollowed out by City-first deindustrialisation and deregulation. Not much chance of that from a government committed to austerity and a small state. But behind the coalition curtain are glimmers of recognition that the private sector won't pick up the slack from the state or rebalance the economy away from a bloated financial sector. Even Cameron is demanding an industrial policy \u2013 though clearly not the kind Vince Cable spelled out in his leaked letter last month. That included not only a call for more public intervention to build up new industries, but for state-controlled RBS to be turned into a public investment bank to support \"sectors of strategic importance\". Cable was slapped down by Cameron and Osborne, and even Labour's Ed Balls balks at the prospect. But the point is unanswerable. Central to the corporate-driven ideology that dominates this government and public debate is a myth: that the risk-taking, entrepreneurial private sector drives technological innovation and industrial advance, while attempts by state bureaucracies to \"pick winners\" are a recipe for disaster. That myth is exploded by Sussex University economist Mariana Mazzucato in her book The Entrepreneurial State. Even in the US, heartland of \"free enterprise\", the public sector has taken the risk to invest in one cutting edge sector after another: from aviation, nuclear energy and computers to the internet, biotechnology and nanotechnology. The private sector has come in later \u2013 and usually reaped the reward. So the algorithms that underpinned Google's success were funded by the public sector. The technology in the Apple iPhone was invented in the public sector. In both the US and Britain it was the state, not big pharma, that funded most groundbreaking \"new molecular entity\" drugs, with the private sector then developing slight variations. And in Finland, it was the public sector that funded the early development of Nokia \u2013 and made a return on its investment. The lessons should be clear. States such as Germany, South Korea and China are now spending far higher proportions of national income on research and development into green technologies. Even some Tory ministers understand that only state intervention can drive the new motors of growth \u2013 but dare not say so publicly. That's hardly surprising. But the government's economic strategy isn't working. If Britain is going to rebuild a broken economy, its political class is going to have to learn to turn its back on three decades of clapped-out myths and bankrupt ideology.
