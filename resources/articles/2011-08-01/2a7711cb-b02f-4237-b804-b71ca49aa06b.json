The other morning I followed the narrow lane from Brund Mill, over the late Victorian arched bridge and onward towards the beckoning, tawny moorsides that climb eventually to the watershed at Morridge. This laneside ditch was home to a flourishing colony of common valerian, more than a yard tall and bedecked with those delightful feathery, pink flowers. This species is also known as \"all-heal\" on account of its healing powers, and a drug extracted from the roots is used as a sedative in the treatment of certain nervous diseases. This plant is Valeriana officinalis, the latter word originating from \"officina\", which describes the storerooms of medieval monasteries where medicines were kept. Climbing the steep pastures beyond Steps Farm, aiming for the dark fringe of conifers that rim the top of Revidge, the dominant flowers were yarrow, alias milfoil or \"thousand leaves\" because of the tiny segments into which these are divided. It tends to favour dry pasturage and roadside banks, and the blooms range from white to pale pink. Here is another useful, herbal remedy because it has the power to stop bleeding and lessens the effects of the common cold. In a ditch close to a ruined farmhouse below the top of Revidge a colony of ragged robin showed off untidy, divided petals where bees were lining up for nectar. It possesses more fascination than the similar but staid red campion. Suddenly half a dozen cows burst out of the ruin where they had been sheltering from the sun; heads forward and tails held high, they galloped off across the rushy ground, shocked at my appearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
