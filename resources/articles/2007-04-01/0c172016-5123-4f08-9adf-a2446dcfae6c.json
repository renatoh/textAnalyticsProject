That was the exasperated reaction of Hugh Dyson, a member of the legendary Oxford writing group the Inklings, when his friend JRR Tolkien launched into his most recent instalment of The Lord of the Rings - and you might be forgiven for having sighed thus yourself amid the brouhaha surrounding the release this month of The Children of Hurin, an allegedly lost chapter in the misty myth of Middle Earth. With its ability to do what no other new novel could, another effing elf book was bound to stoke some cynicism. For starters, where did they dig this up? The story, it turns out, dates back to the darkest days of the First World War, when the 25-year-old Tolkien lay in a cottage in Staffordshire, recovering from trench fever and the tragedy of his friends' deaths in the Battle of Somme. Given his state of mind and the condition of Europe at that moment, it is hardly surprising that the stricken philologist should have found his imagination consumed with thoughts of a cosmic curse. Since childhood, the legends of Germanic and Nordic mythologies had mesmerised Tolkien. But there was something in the Finnish folktale of Kullervo, an anguished youth hunted by the murderer of his father, which struck Tolkien as oddly apt, both personally and universally, to those tormented times. By wedding certain details of the medieval Finnish myth to aspects of The Valkyrie, the second opera in Wagner's Ring, Tolkien fashions a haunted hero all his own: Turin Turambar. Turin and his sister Nienor are the ill-fated offspring of Hurin, Lord of Dor-Lomin, who was imprisoned for having defied the Dark Lord Morgoth back in the ancient era known as the First Age. Set six-and-a-half millennia before the time of Hobbits, The Children of Hurin embodies the author's earliest and gloomiest glimpse into the primordial soup of elvish mythology from which would later crawl forth such familiar figures as Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. Chronicling Turin's attempts to avenge his father's torture and to remove the hex that Morgoth has placed on himself and Nienor, the story itself must have seemed jinxed to Tolkien, resisting strenuous efforts to complete it and remaining in fragments at the time of his death in 1973. For a tale all about the burdens of inheritance, it seems fitting that the responsibility for completing and preparing the book for publication - 90 years after its initial inception in 1917 - should now have fallen to the author's son, Christopher. Tolkien anoraks will recognise parts of the new novel from bits and pieces published in posthumous collections in the late 1970s and mid-Eighties, when Christopher Tolkien, now 82, began annotating the mountain of manuscripts that his father had left behind. The shards of the story that have previously appeared in The Silmarillion (1977; the last book-length Middle Earth novel to appear), Unfinished Tales (1980), The Book of Lost Tales 2 (1984) and The Lays of Beleriand (1985) range in style from opaque prose to Beowulfian verse, and show Tolkien struggling to find a formal footing appropriate to the tale he's telling. 'Once upon a time,' Tolkien confessed late in life, '(my crest has long since fallen) I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy story.' It has taken Christopher Tolkien 30 years to disentangle the cacophony of voices to produce a work that could plausibly be embraced as a prequel to the Ring trilogy. But just as there are those who will be cynical about the commercial motivations for unveiling another 'new' Tolkien novel, there are likely to be scholars who will be suspicious of the kind of textual tampering countenanced here, and who are unlikely to be assuaged by Christopher Tolkien's assurances that his role has amounted to little more than judicious joiner's work - regularising the grammar without compromising the integrity of his father's language. For those who assert that even such well-intentioned tinkering amounts to little less than literary forgery, only an arid academic edition of the extant texts would have been acceptable. But for those in search of a soulful, seamless read the rehabilitation of this sober tale will be gratefully received. Is this the text that Tolkien himself would have produced had he lived? Who can say? What is certain is that The Children of Hurin is a worthy addition to one of the most cherished mythologies in English literature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
