Barack Obama announced that the US-led coalition had collectively agreed to roughly double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5bn, provide education to 1 million more refugee children, and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults. Full details were not disclosed, but the move constituted the most concrete set of refugee measures at the UN general assembly. On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments. But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access for refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work. The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, that are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be honest: it\u2019s still not enough \u2013 not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.\u201d But he added: \u201cI hope this is a beginning.\u201d Leaders from the world\u2019s major refugee-hosting nations praised the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out. Most pledges made at a similar summit in London in February have not been fulfilled. \u201cThe refugee crisis requires not just [pledged] commitment but follow-through,\u201d said King Abdullah of Jordan, a country that hosts more Syrian refugees than all the countries in the EU, whose population is 50 times bigger. The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include measures announced earlier this year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. \u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, a US assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme. It could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work. According to US officials, other labour-related policies included those that simply allow refugees to live outside camps, or give them access to agricultural land. Refugee specialists who had criticised the vague UN-led declaration on Monday were cautiously optimistic about Tuesday\u2019s US-led announcements. David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, a major refugee agency, said: \u201cThe political inertia has finally been broken and now it needs to be turned into genuine momentum through effective implementation of each pledge.\u201d Alexander Betts, head of Oxford University\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre, said: \u201cFor people who are thinking that the achievement of [the UN-led declaration on Monday] was a fairly abstract declaration, [Obama\u2019s summit on Tuesday] is about something more specific. It\u2019s about pledges, it\u2019s about real commitment, it\u2019s about money and resettlement. But the question that remains is about what kinds of pledges will be made and followed through on.\u201d Implementation is also a concern for the US, Richard admitted. \u201cFor me the much harder piece is follow-up,\u201d said Richard. \u201cThe countries that make commitments \u2013 do they mean it, and will they follow through? Usually an administration would spend the next year making sure these countries follow up \u2013 but the Obama administration is going to leave office at the end of January.\u201d More generally, Betts, the Oxford professor, questioned whether even the US-led initiative had gone far enough. At a time of profound need, world leaders had squandered a chance to radically rethink the treaties and organisations that govern the world\u2019s handling of refugees, Betts said, arguing that the refugee system needed to be rethought in the same way that the international monetary system was reworked in the 1970s. \u201cThe refugee regime was created in the 1950s for Europe and the early cold war era,\u201d said Betts. \u201cYes, it\u2019s been adapted incrementally, but we\u2019ve never had a moment of systematic reflection.\u201d Betts added: \u201cIn other areas, like the international monetary system, when there was a big crisis as we saw in 1971, reform took place. 2016 should be the refugee system\u2019s 1971. It should involve reflection on our legal model, our organisational model, and our operational model \u2013 and that\u2019s what the political capital that we\u2019ve invested in these two days should have gone towards. But as it is, I think there are achievements, but I\u2019m not sure these achievements reach the level of ambition that the international community should have had in response to the refugee crisis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
