It's less hassle than writing a resignation letter, of course - but odd, not to say unsettling, to see such camera-shyness in today's coppers. Why, only half an hour before, over on BBC1, police officers seemed to have stampeded for the chance to break down tearfully in front of the corporation's anti-Paxman, Fiona Bruce, in a special documentary. \"I couldn't...\" said one with a brave gaze into the lens. \"I couldn't do another child murder case.\" There were some missing faces, of course - notably the Chapmans' family liaison officer, currently awaiting trial for perverting the course of justice after his friend gave him an alibi for the period when someone was downloading child pornography on to his computer. But all in all it seemed fitting, after such supreme effort had been made to involve us in every infinitesimal detail of the trial, that BBC1 should confer on its viewers the final honour: the chance to play therapist to its senior investigating officers. It is impossible, these days, to underestimate the psychological benefits to policemen of even the briefest appearance on television. Experts in such matters believe the investigation into the three or so images of child porn on Pete Townsend's hard drive would have dragged on for months - had 15 of the investigating officers not been sent into the Who guitarist's home on the teatime news to confiscate his computer. And yet, and yet ... something of yourself should always be kept back in the cop game. The special skill is to navigate a course between extracting the maximum amount of public interest in the details of the case and preserving some sense of mystery to your own work. It's a fine line, and like much police work, difficult to understand in theory. So let's see it in action, in this case in a conversation I had with Tony of the Cambridge police media unit on Tuesday. When I inquired who was responsible for the release to the Press Association of photographs of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman's severed and charred knickers, Tony was understandably reluctant to do anything so unseemly as pin the decision down. Realising I had been wildly prurient, I think I managed to salvage things by steering the conversation on to the decision to provide Fiona Bruce - who repeatedly trumpeted them as \"exclusive to the BBC\" - with footage of Ian Huntley during his actual police interviews. \"We did it,\" explained Tony, \"to help people understand what Ian Huntley is like as a character.\" Aha. And thank you. \"We wanted to place as much information as possible in the documentary.\" You can see the argument. As a nation, certainly, we have been bewilderingly starved of detail during this particular trial, and what better precedent to set than to farm out clips of a murder interview to a public service broadcaster? In fact, I defy anyone to have watched the camera zoom in (high production values, incidentally) on Ian Huntley's twitching knee and not feel that the sum of human knowledge had been boosted dramatically. It turned out, ultimately, that he told lies and seemed keen to evade capture - but who can honestly say they would have divined that about a child murderer unless Fiona Bruce had glossed that footage of him in the nick? A triumph, then, not only for the Cambridgeshire force and the Beeb, but for multi-platform policing in general. Only the hopelessly outdated could see the police as merely a law enforcement agency, when it should be perfectly obvious they are a crucial part of the burgeoning reality TV industry. marina.hyde@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
