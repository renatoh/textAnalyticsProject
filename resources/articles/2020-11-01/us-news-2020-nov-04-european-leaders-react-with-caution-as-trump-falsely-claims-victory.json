Many government leaders remained silent, waiting for events to unfold, though the Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, urged US leaders to allow all the votes to be counted. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the German defence minister, said: \u201cThis is a very explosive situation. This is a situation that can lead to a constitutional crisis in the US, as experts are rightly saying. And it is something that must cause us great concern.\u201d Only one leader, the Slovenian prime minister, Janez Jan\u0161a, jumped the gun by saying it was pretty clear that Trump was the winner, adding that there was no point in the mainstream media denying this fact. By contrast, the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, tried to lower the temperature, saying: \u201cThe American people have spoken. While we wait for the election result, the EU remains ready to continue building a strong transatlantic partnership, based on our shared values and history.\u201d The failure of Joe Biden, a committed pro-European and multilateralist, to yet secure the predicted resounding win reignited the debate in Europe on whether the US could remain a close partner. Some European leaders have suggested that even if Biden is eventually declared the winner, he would be a weakened president, without a Senate majority and therefore likely to be preoccupied by domestic issues and attacks from a still-vibrant Trump movement. The Bundestag foreign affairs committee chairman, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, said Trump had treated Germany as his favourite enemy, and Biden \u201cwould want to work with Germany but would also expect a lot from us. As president, Biden would also focus on China and the Indo-Pacific. That would mean Europe would have to take more responsibility.\u201d The German Green leader, Robert Habeck, said: \u201cIf Trump wins, the global order will change fundamentally. Europe must unite, otherwise it will no longer play a role internationally.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, a leading advocate of greater \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d for Europe, said the US \u201chas not been a friendly partner for the EU. Whether Joe Biden or Trump is chosen by the Americans does not change this strategic fact. The American continent has detached itself from the European continent and it is time for Europeans to assume their responsibilities.\u201d In the UK, Boris Johnson sidestepped calls in parliament from the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, to tell Trump not to interfere in the ballot count, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment as the UK government on the democratic processes of our friends and allies.\u201d Other senior Conservatives including the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it would be calamitous for the democratic cause worldwide if the election ended with the result disputed. Hunt told the BBC: \u201cMy biggest worry is that we forget that the US is the leading democracy in the world, and if we end up with a huge argument about process, and people talking about a stolen elections left, right and centre, we are only going to put a smile on the face of people like President Putin and President Xi who will look at their own people and say \u2018are you not pleased we have not got any of this mess?\u2019 and that would be an absolute disaster. We must remember that the reputation of democracy across the world is at stake here.\u201d Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former UK ambassador to Washington, said the issue if Trump won was whether the US continued to underperform on the world stage. He expressed concern the US was so internally divided and had such deep social problems that it would not provide the leadership the world craves. \u201cI fear we will get more of the same or, even worse, an even more unpredictable and inconsistent leader than in the first term,\u201d he said. Vladimir Putin\u2019s allies in Russia expressed satisfaction with the results so far, claiming that previous allegations that Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 was due to Russian interference had been disproved. Konstantin Kosachev, the chair of the upper house Federation Council committee of foreign affairs, said: \u201c[Russia] benefits from any certainty in which the losers won\u2019t need to resort to [claims of] foreign interference. It\u2019s time for America to return to the politics of sanity, in which case we will always support it. It is high time.\u201d Iran, one of the countries that has most at stake in the election owing to Trump\u2019s policy of maximum economic pressure on Tehran, claimed the US was in decline and predicted that Iran would be able to resist. President Hassan Rouhani said the result of the US election was not important for his country\u2019s clerical rulers, but he called on the next US president to respect international treaties and laws."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
