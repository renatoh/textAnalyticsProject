Rooney has been omitted from England\u2019s 26-man party for the friendly in Germany on Wednesday, followed by the World Cup qualifier against Lithuania four days later, despite telling Southgate that he is available to play for Manchester United at Middlesbrough on Sunday. Southgate admitted that Rooney was unhappy about the decision but praised England\u2019s record scorer for the \u201cvery mature\u201d way he took the news. Rooney has, in turn, been invited to a squad meeting at St George\u2019s Park on Monday when Southgate, speaking in a way that has become rare for England managers, intends to deliver some \u201cbrutal\u201d truths about the diminished state of English football. He clearly does not intend to sugarcoat his words judging by a long diatribe at his squad announcement in which he described himself as embarrassed by England\u2019s failures \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve won three knockout games in 27 years and the last one was in 2006\u201d \u2013 and the man who dropped Rooney in his second game as caretaker manager made it clear the 31-year-old now faces a challenge to get into the squad, never mind the team. \u201cWe have to look at Wayne as a No10, which is his predominant role,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIn the last two games we\u2019ve played Dele Alli there and we\u2019ve played Adam Lallana there. Both are playing very well, scoring and assisting for their clubs. Ross Barkley has been playing very well for his club. So there\u2019s competition. I can\u2019t dress it up any other way. There are some very good players and it\u2019s a battle to get in this squad.\u201d Rooney, he said, had been disappointed but understood the reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t think he expects, if he is not playing every week for his club, to be picked in this sort of situation.\u201d That leaves the question of whether he is still the England captain and Southgate\u2019s verdict is that the role does not exist unless the relevant person is in the team. \u201cWe have this thing about \u2018an England captain\u2019 but really the captain is the person who is captain in the next game, isn\u2019t it? Or the game on the next day. I always just assume you pick a team for a game and the captain of that game is the captain.\u201d Rooney\u2019s two and a half years with the captaincy, starting after Steven Gerrard\u2019s international retirement at the end of the 2014 World Cup, appear to be over therefore, unless he can re-establish himself in the team at a time when Southgate believes English football needs a dramatic wake-up call. His verdict on the state of the national team was as damning as that delivered by any manager in recent memory and was particularly striking bearing in mind these will be his first games since turning his caretaker spell into a full-time role. \u201cThere\u2019s a harsh lens needed on some of the things we are doing,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe need to look at who the top teams are and how we get to their level. I was in a team that made a semi-final [at Euro 96] and that has happened once since 1990. It\u2019s my job to analyse what hasn\u2019t been right and then show the lads a pathway. They will then decide whether they want to come on it or not. I think we need to be pretty brutal about the way we look at it.\u201d That will start on Monday, when Southgate has no intention of dressing up how he feels about England\u2019s deterioration and plans to tell his players he has grown weary of empty promises. \u201cOne of the things I want to talk about is the fact we always talk about what we\u2019d like to achieve but don\u2019t actually look at the reality of where we are. Whatever we think we are as a nation, we\u2019ve not been delivering. We seem to have won medals in almost every other sport. Ours is the missing piece. \u201cThat drives me on as much as anything: the need to start recognising where we really are and how we bridge the gap. Sometimes we get wrapped up in the profile of our league, yet eight to 10 years ago we were always involved in Champions League semi-finals and finals. That just isn\u2019t the case any more. \u201cI remember going to the World Cup in Brazil, scouting for the FA, and watching all the montages before games to show the highlights of previous tournaments and it suddenly struck me: \u2018We\u2019re not on any, none of our players are on them.\u2019 We think we\u2019re whatever, but I\u2019m looking at the screen and there\u2019s all the Brazilians, the Spaniards, the French, and we\u2019re not there. And I\u2019m almost sinking into my seat because you walk in there thinking you\u2019re part of England, massively proud, but actually on the world stage, we\u2019re not there at the moment. And I think part of trying to affect that is to start saying: \u2018Listen, these are the realities.\u2019\u201d Southgate has recalled Jermain Defoe and called up the Southampton pair James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond as well as two other uncapped players, Michael Keane of Burnley and West Ham United\u2019s Michail Antonio. Jake Livermore, of West Bromwich Albion, is involved for the first time in almost five years and Southgate has decided to keep faith with Luke Shaw at a time when he is barely figuring for Manchester United. Shaw\u2019s call-up goes against Southgate\u2019s idea to leave out players who are being omitted by their clubs but Danny Rose, England\u2019s first-choice left-back, is one of several absentees through injury and the manager made a personal call to Shaw to discuss the way he has been marginalised at Old Trafford. The call-up, Southgate said, would \u201chopefully boost how he feels about himself\u201d.
