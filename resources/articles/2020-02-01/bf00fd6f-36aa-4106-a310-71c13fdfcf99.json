Pogba is still recovering from an ankle problem in what is proving an injury-blighted season that has limited him to eight appearances. He last featured as a half\u2011time replacement in the 4-1 win against Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. That was six weeks ago despite Solskj\u00e6r previously stating the France play-maker would miss around a month. Pogba is unsettled at United and is expected to leave in the summer. Solskj\u00e6r, when asked to say conclusively that the 26-year-old will play for United again this term, said: \u201cWell of course I\u2019d like to say that as soon as he gets fit he\u2019ll be good enough to play and I\u2019m sure Paul\u2019s desperate to play for us again.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r also refused to characterise Pogba\u2019s bad luck with injury as being \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the player and club. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get that headline from me. As a player the last thing you want is to be is injured and not being able to contribute to your team. \u201cPaul\u2019s a footballer and he wants to play football. He knows he has to work hard now to get back to his best as he\u2019s been out for so long. It\u2019s a challenge as well for him to get back to his shape. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult period in your career [being injured] but it is part and parcel of being a player \u2013 so I\u2019m not going to give you a headline that his season has been such and such.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r suggested he has only minimum contact with Pogba, who was not in Marbella last week during the squad\u2019s winter break. \u201cHe\u2019s been in and around here [training ground]. And of course I OK\u2019d him doing his recovery somewhere else.\u201d Pressed on why Pogba was not in Spain, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cI don\u2019t have to justify every decision. Paul\u2019s still on his recovery programme, taking off his cast, so when he\u2019s back with us we\u2019ll integrate him. [He\u2019ll be back] hopefully soon. He\u2019s started running on the treadmill so he\u2019s getting closer \u2013 it\u2019s been a long haul so hopefully we can see him back soon. \u201cPaul\u2019s an important player for us but we learn so much about the others as well. Some of the players have really stepped up and taken on responsibility and shown what they can be and what they are for Man United. It\u2019s unfortunate if you get one of your best players injured of course, but that\u2019s just part of it, part of being here. I can\u2019t feel sorry for myself because we\u2019ve had all these injuries \u2013 we\u2019re building a squad that can cope with this.\u201d Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford are two other frontline players also undergoing rehabilitation from respective injuries. Odion Ighalo was signed in January as short-term cover for Rashford yet the manager indicated the striker could land a permanent deal if he performs well. \u201cIt\u2019s a loan but when you\u2019re in the door if you impress it gives you a chance,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the same for everyone who signs \u2013 if permanent or a loan: if you impress as a player, person, if you can help this group improve, there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll look at extending things. And it\u2019s up to us as well that he\u2019ll want to stay if we wanted him.\u201d Of the winter break Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cIt was more about getting the group together again \u2013 the first week to refresh, then we had our first training together for five months. That\u2019s a quite a long time. There were [also] a couple of things we haven\u2019t been happy with [regarding team play] and we had to sort.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
