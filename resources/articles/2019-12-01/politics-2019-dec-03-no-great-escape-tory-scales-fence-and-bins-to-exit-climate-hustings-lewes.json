For one 63-year-old Tory councillor confronted with a less than receptive audience during a climate crisis debate the answer was to clamber over some bins and scale a fence. Nancy Bikson was a last-minute replacement for the Conservative prospective MP Maria Caulfield, who was too \u201cbusy\u201d to attend climate hustings for candidates in the key marginal seat of Lewes, East Sussex, at a school on Monday evening. Explaining that she was afforded little time to prepare for the event organised by local groups, including a branch of Extinction Rebellion, Bikson said she would not be sticking around for questions after making a short speech. She attracted groans from the crowd, with one man heckling her before she even began speaking, asking: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go now?\u201d Bikson said she cared deeply about the environment and that she \u201cdid her bit\u201d but concluded, to further groans: \u201cIt\u2019s all about us, there is no such thing as government. Government is just people.\u201d Though she eventually gained polite applause, Bikson left the stage after other candidates made speeches and the event was opened to questions from the audience. However, when she left via the fire escape she found herself outside in a dead end as the school gates were locked. Rather than trudging back through the packed hall to get out, she pondered her predicament for up to 45 minutes before opting to climb over the fence. Bikson\u2019s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school. The teenager, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI left about an hour early and about half an hour after she [Bikson] left the stage. I came outside and I was about to cycle off and she was behind the gate next to our school canteen which was locked and said, \u2018excuse me, can you help me?\u2019 She sounded quite desperate. I said the only way back out is through the auditorium and she said she didn\u2019t want to go back through the auditorium because of everyone. She said \u2018they all despise me \u2026 and they don\u2019t want me to go back in there\u2019.\u201d Explaining that she felt sorry for the stranded politician, the teenager added: \u201cI went back into the canteen to try and open the door from the inside [allowing her a route of escape] but it was locked. Then I got a caretaker. I said a caretaker is coming but she said, \u2018don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just climb over the gate\u2019. And she got up on the school bins and climbed over the gate. She\u2019d been out there for a while.\u201d After hearing the tale, the schoolgirl\u2019s mother, who runs a business managing composers, brought the councillor\u2019s ordeal to a wider audience, posting on Facebook: \u201cLewes Tory MP Maria Caulfield failed to show for tonight\u2019s climate hustings. Her last-minute replacement left the hall before the questions, having first explained that she knew nothing about climate or the environment. \u201cShe was spotted by my daughter 45 minutes later still trying to find her way off the premises without having to go back through the hall. She ended up climbing the fence via the bins. Ignominious.\u201d Bikson apparently admitted her actions later, telling the Evening Standard on Tuesday \u201cIt was only because there wasn\u2019t any other way and I didn\u2019t want to disrupt everybody. It was either that or sit outside for a couple of hours.\u201d But when the Guardian rang to get her version of events she was tight-lipped, replying: \u201cI can neither confirm nor deny, thank you.\u201d Lewes was previously held by the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker for nearly two decades before being won by Brexiter Caufield in 2015. But the Conservatives only have a majority of just over 5,000, meaning the constituency, which narrowly voted remain during the EU referendum, is a top target for the Lib Dems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
