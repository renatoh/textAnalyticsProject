Just as everyone had concluded that \"Derbyshire revival\" was a contender for cricket's most redundant phrase, back-to-back wins against Glamorgan and Durham have given them their finest start to a championship season for nearly half a century - and left Cork to imagine that an England recall is within his compass. Yesterday was less generous with its favours: a Benson &amp; Hedges northern group tie reduced by rain to 10 overs, and a 10-wicket defeat for Derbyshire against their keenest rivals. Cork's stumps were among three sets splayed in one over by the South African left-armer Greg Smith, leaving a score of 72 for seven which Lance Klusener, bashing, and Chris Read, bracing, overhauled with 10 balls to spare. Cork's England route also looks blocked: Andrew Flintoff's reputation has blossomed, Craig White is still around, and Alex Tudor, a glowing CV from the Academy behind him, has begun his Surrey season in style. But Cork's 18 championship wickets have not gone unnoticed, with the England selector Geoff Miller braving the bleakness of Derby in April. \"Dusty asked me if I had seen any promising players around,\" Cork said. \"I reminded him that I was still around and promised that I'd keep putting him under pressure with wickets and runs. If I thought I was never going to play for England again I would consider retiring. \"I still have a lot to offer. I've worked hard to get my game right; I've experienced a lot of highs and lows. Last season I was still recovering from my stress fracture and it took time to get my confidence back. Now I'm swinging the ball again. I had ballooned to 15 stone but I spent at least four days a week at the gym this winter and I'm the fittest I've ever been.\" Derbyshire also have a leaner look. Among the new signings is a Pakistani, Mohammad Ali Bukhari, taken on after a tip-off from Cork's father. \"Ali hits the bat as hard as anyone in the country. He is the quickest we've had since Devon Malcolm,\" Cork said. \"I want to see the club I love progress again. I don't want people to look at Derbyshire and say ho ho, they are at the bottom again.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
