The deputy prime minister chose a seminar hosted by the prince to announce that thousands of new homes should be built to strict style rules or design codes. Such a system was used on Poundbury, the prince's retro Dorset village, and the Florida town of Seaside - the setting for satirical film The Truman Show - which Mr Prescott visited earlier this year. The move comes on the day that the government's architecture watchdog published a report cautioning against the use of prescriptive codes. Such codes \"give licence to architectural fundamentalism that could lead to artificial homogeneity\", according to the report by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. It accepts that codes may help improve the quality of \"soulless housing estates\". But it adds: \"One of our fears about the use of codes is that they could be used to favour only one form or architectural expression.\" \"We would be worried if Poundbury and Seaside were used as a model,\" said the report's author Alex Ely, Cabe's housing coordinator. But in his speech at a Prince's Foundation seminar, Mr Prescott said: \"Coding can produce the regularity of a London square of the variety of Seaside. Urban coding or 'community coding' as I would prefer to call it has a lot to offer.\" He announced that new measures would soon be introduced to ensure that coding is more widely used. Mr Prescott said: \"I'm not talking about colonial style houses. I'm talking about how to produce an attractive, well planned environment quickly and efficiently.\" He also praised the Poundbury village. \"I know that some of our leading architects have criticised it,\" he said, \"but I also know that it was architects who gave awards to the concrete monstrosities that were built as homes for ordinary people.\" Despite its reservations about codes, Cabe has been asked to develop Mr Prescott's ideas. Cabe's report said that codes should not prescribe rules of the kind set out in the pattern books for the Poundbury development. Instead it said they should set out broad principles for design. \"Cabe favours codes that ensure we get the fundamentals right but are not so prescriptive that they give too little scope for distinctive architectural expression.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
