In 2006, California enacted a law referred to as AB32, a landmark environmental law that establishes a timetable to bring California into near compliance with the Kyoto protocol by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020. Proposition 23 is a proposal to \"suspend\" the AB32 provisions until unemployment in the state falls to the level it was when the law was introduced and stays there for a year. The proposition uses a clever ploy: it blames the clean-air laws for the state's economic woes, not the banking collapse, and puts a removal condition in place that makes it unknowable as to when, if ever, the \"suspension\" will be revoked. Such conditions are anathema to investors. Venture capitalists are not reckless: they need to be able to calculate the risk level they face. Calculating that risk level is made easier by having a legislative background that is transparent, long-lasting and clear. As far as I can ascertain, this is the first time that people anywhere have been given the chance to vote simply on whether to go back to pollution. How Californians vote could have a global impact: California's economy is, in effect, the 7th largest in the world. Proposition 23 is mainly financed by two Texan oil companies that have refineries in the state and is opposed by a broad alliance under the banner of stopdirtyenergyprop.com. The committee cannot accept donations from non-US nationals, but it can be supported through social media. Polls suggest that voters' intentions are finely balanced, so there is a real possibility for individuals to make a real difference through taking action.
