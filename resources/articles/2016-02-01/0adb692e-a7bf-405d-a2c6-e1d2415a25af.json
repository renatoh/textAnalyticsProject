Hiddink is not abandoning all hope of Chelsea finishing in the top four this season but the interim manager accepts that such a finale is unlikely given that the club are languishing in 13th going into Sunday\u2019s match against Manchester United, 16 points behind fourth-placed Arsenal. The Dutchman will step down at the end of the campaign and he believes that what Chelsea do after that will determine whether it will make a quick recovery from this season\u2019s troubles. Financially Chelsea can afford to go without the Champions League for a season but in order to lure players \u2013 and retain any existing ones that they wish to keep \u2013 Chelsea must convince that they have a plan to bring the good times back. \u201cThat is a matter for what the club is showing in terms of philosophy, strategy and ambition,\u201d says Hiddink. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get Champions League one year but you show you are very keen to get back, that might be important for players. Everything is to do with the ambition of the club, and loyalty is secured by contracts. If a club shows you have a plan and a strong squad then it can be attractive as well.\u201d Hiddink says that if Chelsea were to fall just short of a Champions League spot this season and reach the Europa League instead, the club could use Europe\u2019s secondary competition to give experience to young players who have had precious little opportunity to establish themselves in the first team at Stamford Bridge in recent years. \u201cI think you can make it part of your strategy,\u201d says Hiddink. \u201cYou can also use that for bringing in young players if you don\u2019t think it is a very important league. I don\u2019t want to have it without prestige but the multitude of games gives opportunities to young players aged 18 to 21 to bring them in to that competition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
