The revelations are contained in a submission by Benedict Coyne, the Greens candidate for Dutton\u2019s seat of Dickson, who had complained to a parliamentary inquiry into the May election. The submission cites Channel Seven reporting that on election day volunteers wearing maroon shirts distributed cards urging voters to \u201cvote for Queensland\u201d with instructions on \u201chow to vote for a minor party or independent\u201d. The cards suggested candidate orders for voters of the Greens, United Australia party and One Nation parties, among others. All permutations placed Dutton above Labor\u2019s Ali France. The cards were authorised by Warwick Armstrong, from a redacted address which Coyne submitted had a Dutton corflute out front on election day. The AEC also sought to share responsibility for the issue with the police, which it said had twice chosen not to investigate similar complaints of unauthorised how-to-vote cards siphoning second preferences to non-preferred candidates. Coyne submitted that his official how-to-vote cards directed voters to put France third, after the Animal Justice party, and ahead of Dutton, ranked fifth, and the unauthorised material was therefore \u201ccompletely contradictory\u201d. Coyne submitted that the unauthorised how-to-vote cards may breach section 329 of the Electoral Act, which prohibits material that misleads and deceives voters about the process of casting their vote. Coyne complained that his preference flows were \u201cmisrepresented and exploited as part of what seemed a somewhat elaborate and coordinated campaign to ensure the vote of the incumbent LNP candidate Peter Dutton\u201d. Dutton won Dickson with a primary vote of 45.9% after receiving 54.64% of the two-party-preferred vote, with a 2.95% swing in his favour. Coyne\u2019s submission included an email the AEC wrote to a Dickson independent candidate, Thor Prohaska, on 22 May explaining why it did not take action against the material. The AEC wrote that although it became aware of the material at 10.10am on election day after a complaint from GetUp, it formed the view it was \u201cclear that this was not an official [how to vote] card\u201d authorised by the listed candidates. \u201cThe AEC is of the view that images of the [how to vote] card in this instance did not mislead voters about marking their first preferences for the candidates of their choice,\u201d it said. \u201cThe issue of false second preference vote directions is rather more complex.\u201d The AEC noted a breach of section 329 is a criminal offence, requiring investigation by the Australian federal police and referral to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions. \u201cOn at least two previous occasions the AEC has made a referral of second preference [how-to-vote] cards that differed from the officially endorsed [how-to-vote] card to the AFP for investigation,\u201d it said. \u201cOn both occasions the AFP has refused to accept the referral on the basis that the disparity between the official and the fake second preferences listed was apparent on the face of the card and that the elector still marked a valid first-preference vote in accordance with their intentions. \u201cThe AEC formed the view that the [how-to-vote card in this instance would fall within the previous approach taken by the AFP and would not be progressed for criminal action.\u201d Coyne submitted that section 329 is directed at conduct \u201cinfluencing the way in which a ballot paper is actually marked\u201d and therefore applies \u201cnotwithstanding the first preferences are accurate\u201d on the Armstrong how-to-vote card. He suggested \u201call subsequent preferences are not only misleading and inaccurate but seek to benefit a particular candidate in a coordinated, organised and mischievous way\u201d and it would therefore be \u201cabsurd\u201d if this were not considered a breach. \u201cIt is unclear why the AFP has taken no action and I would encourage the [joint standing committee on electoral matters] to obtain a response from the AFP on this issue.\u201d At its first public hearing in the 2019 election inquiry on Friday, the AEC submitted that it lacked the resources and powers to investigate the opaque funding used to spread political ads on Facebook. In written submissions the inquiry has heard from civil society groups calling for spending caps on elections, the Coalition calling for a shorter pre-poll period, and Labor, which wants social media giants subjected to more scrutiny for failing to take down false material."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
