Clear Channel is being swallowed by a group led by Thomas H Lee Partners and Bain Capital, in a deal that will deliver a $1.8bn cash windfall to the Mays family, who founded the business in 1972. Traditional media companies have been fleeing the US stock market to escape their low valuations. Experts say short-term pressure from stock market investors and the pressure of reporting quarterly earnings make Wall Street an uncomfortable place for companies seen as old-style media operators. Clear Channel, which as well as its outdoor advertising arm owns 1,150 radio stations in the US, is attempting to build a hi-tech presence in response to advertisers migrating to digital and online platforms. \"It's a difficult time for a public media company to make the kind of investments needed to build for success in the future,\" a source close to the Clear Channel transaction said. \"For any media company that's changing gears, short-term investors are not always supportive.\" Clear Channel operates more than 800,000 outdoor advertising displays worldwide. In Britain, it has 80,000 hoardings and spaces on streets, taxis, phone booths and at airports - some under the Adshel brand. Its presence in Europe is a legacy of its takeover of the London-based More Group in 1997. Clear Channel's chief executive, Mark Mays, said: \"We are very pleased to announce this transaction which provides substantial value to our shareholders.\" Thomas H Lee's co-president, Scott Sperling, said: \"Clear Channel is one of the nation's truly great companies that has the finest collection of outdoor and radio assets in the industry.\" The company has faced criticism in the US over the speed at which it has conducted an auction, which was completed in little over a month. The Mays family, who hold three top executive positions and own 7% of the shares, did not vote on the deal to avoid a conflict of interest. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
