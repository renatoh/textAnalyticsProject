A guide to intimacy during the coronavirus outbreak", "bodyText": "With countries on lockdown and millions being made to stay at home, it\u2019s unsurprising many couples and single people are wondering what coronavirus means for their sex lives. With this in mind, we asked three experts five of the most pressing questions about intimacy during the pandemic. Is Covid-19 sexually transmissible? Dr Jessica Justman: We\u2019re not seeing patterns that indicate sexual transmission. It\u2019s primarily spread through respiratory droplets. And touching contaminated surfaces is thought to be the secondary mode of transmission. Dr Carlos Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz: There is no evidence that the Covid-19 can be transmitted via either vaginal or anal intercourse. However, kissing is a very common practice during sexual intercourse, and the virus can be transmitted via saliva. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted by kissing. There is also evidence of oral-fecal transmission of the Covid-19 and that implies that analingus may represent a risk for infection. So is it OK to have sex? Justman: If you or your partner is a Covid-19 case, the advice is to steer clear of each other as much as possible. Dr Julia Marcus: But for people who don\u2019t have symptoms and don\u2019t have any recent likely exposure and have been staying close to home, I think that, if it\u2019s within your own household, it\u2019s a different story. If you live with a regular sexual partner and you don\u2019t have any symptoms, or likely exposure, sex might actually be a really great way to have fun, stay connected and relieve anxiety during this potentially stressful time. What about new partners? Marcus: The recommendation right now is that we try to stay home as much as we can and really only interact with people for things that are essential, like groceries. And even when we do that, try to keep some physical distance of about 6ft from other people. That would definitely make sex a challenge. Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz: Sexual intercourse may decrease during the next few weeks, but other forms of expressing eroticism, such as sexting, video-calls, reading erotica and masturbation will continue to be options. How can someone keep sex toys clean? Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz: Just use soap and water. We don\u2019t know how long this pandemic will last. What do you say to someone who\u2019s single now and doesn\u2019t want to wait months before they can be intimate with someone? Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz: If you\u2019re concerned about practicing social distancing for too long, make sure that you and the people you know practice social distancing now. The sooner we do it, the sooner we\u2019ll see a decline in new infections, and the sooner we will be able to change our practice of socializing. Rather than focusing on the future, we need to focus on the present. Use these couple of weeks to channel your energy, explore yourself, maybe think about what it is that you\u2019re looking for. And you can do that by yourself. It can be a great opportunity to explore other ways of engaging with new sexual partners that you can meet online by sexting or using video calls.

In relation to coronavirus and ibuprofen, the NHS currently advises: \u201cThere is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse. But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you. If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) on the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first.\u201d Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.
