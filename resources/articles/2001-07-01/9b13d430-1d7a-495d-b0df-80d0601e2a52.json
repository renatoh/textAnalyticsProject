Market analysts Datamonitor suggest car salesmen could find themselves priced out of the marketplace by a dramatic boom in internet motor sales. The new report also suggests consumers would even be prepared to go as far as buying their cars from supermarkets, if this was an available option. Current laws dictate that manufacturers can only sell cars through registered franchised dealerships. But Datamonitor, predicting that European laws will soon be changed, said online sales could rocket by more than 140% by 2002. \"Consumer acceptance of the internet as a sales channel will lead to a period of dramatic growth. Car dealers must re-evaluate their online offerings if they are to weather the storm of this increased competition,\" said Datamonitor analyst Laurence Stock. He said high car costs and the furore surrounding the \"rip-off Britain\" campaign have left motorists looking for new ways to buy cars. \"With consumers eager to secure the best deal and becoming increasingly open to new retailing avenues, this is a serious opportunity that no player in the automotive industry can afford to miss,\" he said. At the moment, many online companies, such as Virgin, must act as a middle-man between consumers and car dealerships. But the liberalising of laws, which are likely to go through the European parliament in 2002, will allow internet-based companies to sell direct to consumers, greatly increasing competition, Mr Stock added. He said the study suggests that alongside the wealth of predicted online sales would come a growth in sales at auto centres and, yes, even supermarkets. More than half of the people surveyed in the UK would buy a car from a centre such as Kwik-Fit or Halfords, while more than a quarter would pick up a car with the weekly supermarket shopping. The findings were based on 7,500 Impact 2001 interactive surveys across Europe and the USA. About 1,000 respondents were from the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
