It comes as an associate of Rudolph Giuliani said he travelled to Ukraine to warn that unless an investigation was announced into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, US aid would be frozen to the country and Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president. According to the New York Times, the claim by Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born American charged last month with campaign finance violations for channelling foreign money into the president\u2019s campaign, \u201cdirectly links\u201d Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to threats of repercussions or a quid pro quo with Ukraine, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. House investigations centre on concerns over Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals, in return for nearly $400m in military aid and a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Parnas is preparing to speak to impeachment investigators but his account has been disputed by his business partner, Igor Fruman, who was also charged with campaign finance violations, and by Giuliani, who told the NYT he \u201ccategorically\u201d did not tell Parnas to deliver the reported message to Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry followed the whistleblower, an intelligence official, raising concerns about a 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which the US president raised the notion of his counterpart doing the US \u201ca favour\u201d. The incomplete White House memo about the 25 July call remains a key point of contention. Trump said on Saturday he would soon release details of another call with the Ukrainian leader. House committees led by Schiff have so far heard testimony in private. Transcripts released this week were mostly damaging to the White House, bringing the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, firmly into the spotlight over his apparent role in offering the quid pro quo. Mulvaney and other key aides have refused to testify, defying congressional subpoenas and raising fears of a constitutional crisis. On Friday night, Mulvaney asked to join a lawsuit which asks a judge to decide whether a more junior aide should testify. The move could put the chief of staff at odds with the president he serves. Public hearings are scheduled to begin on Wednesday. In his own letter on Saturday, Nunes criticised Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment inquiry and set out the witnesses Republicans would like to question. Among them were the whistleblower, whom the president and his allies have demanded be identified contrary to federal law; Hunter Biden, the son of former vice-president Joe Biden who is accused without evidence of corruption in Ukraine; Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American former Democratic National Committee staffer; and Nellie Ohr, a former contractor for the political intelligence firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the famous Steele dossier on Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. The move indicated a key Republican tactic: to steer argument towards supposed wrongdoing regarding Ukraine involving Trump\u2019s enemies, not the president. Schiff countered, saying the inquiry and his committee would \u201cnot serve as vehicles\u201d for \u201csham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 US election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit\u201d. On Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo, the Trump ally and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham trafficked in one such conspiracy theory, saying: \u201cWhen you find out who the whistleblower is you will find out it\u2019s somebody from the Deep State and had interactions with Schiff and this thing\u2019s going to stink to high heaven.\u201d The Deep State conspiracy theory holds that a permanent and unelected government of bureaucrats and security officials is determined to thwart Trump. In a recent book by the New York Times reporter James B Stewart, the former White House adviser Steve Bannon, a key propagator of the theory, said it was \u201cfor nut cases\u201d. Public hearings will bring the inquiry on to the national stage, opening a vital front in the battle for public opinion as an election year looms. Successive polls have shown slim majorities backing Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal. As Democrats hold the House, it seems likely it will vote for impeachment. As Republicans hold the Senate, it seems unlikely Trump will be convicted and removed. On Sunday members of key House committees set out the parties\u2019 positions on why Trump is being impeached, cases they must now take to the American people. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the intelligence committee, said: \u201cWe have evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president\u2019s opponent.\u201d On ABC\u2019s This Week, Jackie Speier, also a California Democrat and a member of the intelligence panel, boiled it down further: \u201cThis is a very simple, straightforward act: the president broke the law.\u201d For the Republicans, the House armed services committee ranking member, Mac Thornberry, told ABC of Trump\u2019s behaviour: \u201cI believe it was inappropriate, I do not believe it was impeachable.\u201d Thornberry also repeated a common charge from Republicans \u2013 made by Trump on Twitter \u2013 that Democrats running the inquiry are doing so in partisan fashion. \u201cThere has to be a fair way to arbitrate,\u201d he said, \u201cto decide who the witnesses are. We have had none of that so far.\u201d Democrats have countered that they are following rules laid down by Republicans when they investigated Hillary Clinton over the Benghazi attack of September 2012. Two Republican senators insisted Trump had done nothing wrong. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said Trump had not sought a quid pro quo. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard the president say, \u2018I want to dig up dirt on a potential 2020 opponent,\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always heard the president consistently concerned about is \u2018what happened in 2016. How did this false narrative with Russian collusion with my campaign occur? Why was I strapped with the special counsel?\u2019 It\u2019s a very human desire.\u201d On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, the libertarian Kentuckian Rand Paul indicated that Trump did seek a quid pro quo, and said doing so was not wrong. \u201cI think it\u2019s a big mistake for anybody to argue \u2018Quid pro quo, he didn\u2019t have quid pro quo,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s what the administration\u2019s arguing. I wouldn\u2019t make that argument. \u201cI would make the argument that every politician in Washington, other than me, virtually, is trying to manipulate Ukraine to their purposes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
