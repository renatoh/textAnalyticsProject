Sally Dowler and her husband Bob, who will give evidence to the inquiry in person on Monday, later sued the News of the World when it was revealed that it was the paper that had illegally accessed their daughter's phone, deleting some voicemails to make space for more and, in the process, giving them false hope that she was alive [see footnote]. \"Perhaps there are no words which can adequately describe how despicable this act was,\" their barrister, David Sherborne said. He also told the inquiry that the couple believed the paper had been able to gain information about their movements because \"their voicemails \u2026 were being listened to\". A front-page story published in the paper on 12 May 2002, five days after Milly went missing, was published under the headline: \"The Longest Walk\". It included photos of the Dowlers retracing their missing daughter's last steps. Sherborne said the paper only knew they were taking that walk in Walton-on-Thames \u2013 as \"a way of coming to terms with their private grief\" \u2013 because their phones had been targeted. \"Their moment of grief was obviously a photo opportunity too good to resist,\" he added. Sherborne is representing 51 public figures, including Sienna Miller, Charlotte Church and Hugh Grant, who say they have been badly treated by the British press. In the course of his dramatic address, he also claimed that Tinglan Hong, the mother of Hugh Grant's baby, was threatened \"in the most menacing terms\" over the phone by an anonymous caller while Grant was appearing on the BBC's Question Time. She was allegedly told: \"Tell Hugh Grant he must shut the fuck up.\" Sherborne said the incident had now been reported to the police. He also told the inquiry that Church had her mobile phone targeted by the News of the World. He said the singer's mother had been approached by the paper shortly after a suicide attempt and it had negotiated a \"Faustian pact\" in which she agreed to tell her story in exchange for the paper not running further stories about her husband's affair. Sherborne said Church had endured horrendous treatment from the tabloids, including photographers trying to open car doors while she was inside in order to take pictures up her skirt. News International chose not to comment. \u2022 The following was published on 12 December 2011 in the corrections and clarifications column: An article about the investigation into the abduction and death of Milly Dowler (News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone during police hunt, 5 July, page 1) stated that voicemail \"messages were deleted by [NoW] journalists in the first few days after Milly's disappearance in order to free up space for more messages. As a result friends and relatives of Milly concluded wrongly that she might still be alive.\" Since this story was published new evidence \u2013 as reported in the Guardian of 10 December \u2013 has led the Metropolitan police to believe that this was unlikely to have been correct and that while the News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone the newspaper is unlikely to have been responsible for the deletion of a set of voicemails from the phone that caused her parents to have false hopes that she was alive, according to a Metropolitan police statement made to the Leveson inquiry on 12 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
