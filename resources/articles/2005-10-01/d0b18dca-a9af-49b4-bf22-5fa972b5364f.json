The search giant Google, probably the single biggest online operator, has taken a unilateral decision to scrap a time-honoured UK system of commission payments which it views with suspicion. It claims this UK custom, which is used in traditional media advertising too, is not duplicated in any of the other markets where it operates. Google, the world's most valuable media company, is being accused of throwing its weight around. Last week, the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) digital marketing group, led by Wayne Arnold, managing director of Profero, met with Nikesh Arora, vice president of Google Europe. Afterwards Arora said there was no question of a change in policy. At the heart of the dispute is a custom in which media sales and planning operators pay Google for key words in a pay-for-click system, which then drive people to adverts and products for sale. In the UK, agencies receive a regular commission back from the media owner of around 15% of the amount they spend, which they either keep as a fee, or share with the advertiser. Instead, Google is introducing a global system, called best practice funding, which will reward those who spend most with Google. The IPA says: \"The net result would be to create an un-level playing field in which the dominant operator [Google] would unfairly discriminate against smaller agencies, and could squeeze them out of the market.\" Arora insists the old system did not create a fair marketplace, adding: \"Is a 15% payback a transparent system? We have introduced best practice funding in more than 25 markets and only in the UK and a bit in Germany have we met opposition. Other countries such as Spain, Italy, the Nordic countries, are applauding it.\" Part of the payments Google will make are earmarked for training. \"You need a high degree of professionalism to succeed in search marketing,\" says Arora. But opponents argue that other internet operators, such as Yahoo, Overture and Lycos, are not changing the system. They also say Google is in such a powerful position that there is really no question of boycotting the company. With less commission being paid in cash, the prices for search advertising are predicted to rise further, although Google disputes this. It already accounts for 40.2% of the medium's revenue - some \u00a3400m if the expected boom continues, with the lion's share going to Google. Maggie Brown Community awards Please, no more heroes It is mean, I know, to rain on the parade of an acclaimed hero - and doubly so when that hero is a child. Still, it was with an irritated and heavy heart that I watched to last week's Daily Mirror Pride of Britain shebang, in which - yet again - nice people and seriously cute children were lined up to receive awards for a variety of charming achievements. Not that they were alone. Last month the Daily Mail had Carer of the Year, next month the Daily Express will have Lifesavers and after that the Sun will pitch in with WonderMum; each involves a posh hotel and a sprinkling of celebrities, and there is often a broadcaster as one of the co-sponsors (ITV, GMTV and This Morning all regularly contribute, so the paper gets TV promotion). Tony and Cherie grab what must be one of their easier photo-ops and, thus, pages and pages of newsprint are easily and inexpensively filled. With goodwill bouncing off the walls, nobody challenges this self-serving exercise for what it is: a cynical manipulation whereby, rather than taking the trouble to go out and report real news, newspapers manufacture their own cosy semblance of it; by itself not a shining principle for our trade, and worse when you look at the scraping of barrels required to do it. The Daily Express's Lifesavers is mostly reduced either to rewarding people for just doing their jobs - admirable workers they may be, but \"lifeboatmen rescue man at sea\" would not, under normal circumstances, make the centre spread of a national - or for a simply human response which, again, is not the stuff of proper news, like \"Boy bicycles jolly quickly to get help for injured brother\". The Mirror rewarded a nine-year-old sweetie who was alone with her mother in labour and who \"helped\" (did she have a choice?) and a seven-year-old burnt by a petrol bomb (ditto). You could argue that the kiddies had a smashing day out, don't be so horrid, why does it matter? Well, because, sometimes, it really does. The Daily Mail's \"Carer of the Year\" went to 14-year-old Kirstie King, who had nursed her father until his death from cancer and now cares for a crippled mother and a disabled younger sibling. That any British child be left with this burden (let alone 100,000 of them) is an obscenity. Every column inch devoted to her award is an inch less for what a newspaper should be doing: ferociously campaigning to remove that obscenity, and working not to give Kirstie a trophy but to give her a childhood back, instead. Carol Sarler Television BBC boffins behind bars When the BBC commissioned a televised study into the effects of power it took just a week for the simulated prison it set up to move from oligarchy, through revolution to rule by commune and back towards tyranny. But the wheels of academe move more slowly. Three-and-a-half years after The Experiment, the academics behind the programme are about to publish their research. They claim it is the first time research commissioned for a TV programme has passed the hurdles to appear in an academic journal. And that this answers critics who dismissed their experiment as mere reality TV. At the time, it certainly seemed to have Big Brother elements, although it never quite elicited the same level of audience enthusiasm. Two groups of men, recruited through ads, were randomly divided into prisoners and guards and lumped together in a set of bare, brightly lit, overheated rooms. Tasks were set for prisoners, and the guards were told to keep order, while frustration, resentment and boredom set in. The programme was inspired by Phillip Zimbardo's 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, which proved so dramatically that giving one group of men power over another results in sadism that it had to be stopped early. Alex Haslam and Steve Reicher, the pair behind the BBC's experiment, draw a less depressing conclusion. Backed by data drawn from psychometric and physical tests for stress on those taking part, their results suggest that tyranny is not an automatic outcome of putting one group in charge of another but is often to do with the failure of a society to organise itself. In fact, they say, groups can often give individuals the confidence to change things. Not that Zimbardo is impressed by any of this. He still believes that the use of television so distorted what he refers to as the \"pseudo study\" that it renders it useless, and refused to give his backing to publication.
