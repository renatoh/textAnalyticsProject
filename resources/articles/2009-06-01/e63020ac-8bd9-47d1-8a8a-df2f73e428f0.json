Alfred Nobel is Aidan O'Brien's 11th winner of this Group Two event in the last 13 years, and three of the previous 10 \u2013 George Washington, Rock Of Gibraltar and King Of Kings \u2013 went on to win the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket the following May. On that basis, he should be a 100\u201330 shot for the Classic, yet one bookie was offering 25\u20131 after yesterday's race. The bad news, though, is that the bookie in question is Ladbrokes, historically the firm with the best line to the relative merits of O'Brien's horses. If they are offering 25\u20131, you have to suppose that Ballydoyle houses at least one juvenile colt that is reckoned to be Alfred Nobel's superior, while this form was also a long way short of the standard set by Canford Cliffs in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. Nonetheless, O'Brien can be expected to move Alfred Nobel up to Group One company in due course, perhaps in the Phoenix Stakes, which was the next step for Mastercraftsman, last year's Railway Stakes winner. \"He progressed from his first run to his second, his second run to his third, and now he's come forward again,\" O'Brien said. \"He was green when he hit the front, and leaned away from the ground, and you'd hope he'd get a mile in time.\" Youmzain, the runner-up in two Arcs, was a major disappointment in the big race on the continent yesterday, the Grand Prix de St Cloud. Sent off at a shade of odds-on, Mick Channon's runner could finish only third behind Spanish Moon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
