Leading contenders to replace Sir Alan Budd in the three-man Office for Budget Responsiblility are also mostly men. So why have the two most important economic bodies in the land become an all-boys club? Treasury sources suggest just 4 of the 38 applicants for the vacant MPC post were female, but those few who have made it to the top of the profession argue the shortage of experienced women economists has nothing to do with a lack of basic skills. \"They can do the maths. In fact girls have been doing better at maths in recent times. It's for other reasons they don't go into economics and the macroeconomics practised by the MPC in particular,\" said Diane Coyle, a former Treasury economist who now runs an independent economics consultancy. She said some women spurned macro economics in favour of more rewarding areas measuring more tangible results from individual industries. But more importantly, says Coyle, the crucial period for advancement is the same time women have children. \"The point you need to be writing heavyweight discussion papers is the point women are taking time off,\" she said. The lure of public service bodies that provide long maternity leave and consultancy practices that offer flexible hours also takes women away from the male-dominated macro arena. Karen Mumford, an economics professor at York University who studies Labour markets, said the MPC gender balance was reflected across the profession. She said the Government Economic Service and quangos such as the pay review bodies are staffed by professors who are overwhelmingly male. A recent survey of universities for the Royal Economic Society found that the situation had improved since 1996 when women made up about 15% of lecturers and 5% of the professors. By 2008 women could claim 30% lecturers' posts and 10% of professorships. However, the general situation was little changed. Former MPC member DeAnne Julius said the problem faced by the committee was not so much a lack of women as a dangerous like-mindedness among the members who share the same backgrounds and experience. She said women can bring a different perspective that can prevent \"group-think\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
