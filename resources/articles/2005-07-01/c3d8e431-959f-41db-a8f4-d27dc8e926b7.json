The woman, known only as Davinia, was captured as she stumbled from the wreckage of the train near Edgware Road station, being helped by a bystander. The disturbing but mesmerising picture, used by the Times and Daily Telegraph, has become one of the iconic images of the atrocity. Davinia, who is still in a stable condition in a London hospital, said the good wishes of so many people were very comforting. She also thanked emergency workers for their heroic efforts after the bomb exploded. A statement issued by Davinia's family said: \"We would like to thank everyone for the concern that they have shown for Davinia and thank all those who helped both Davinia and ourselves through this time of crisis. \"We would like to give particular thanks to all the emergency services, and the people that work for them, for their assistance and support following Thursday's tragedy. \"We are thankful for the well-wishers, but ask that Davinia's privacy is respected and that she is allowed to get the rest that she requires to get better. \"It has meant a lot to Davinia that we can take solace in all the support and encouragement that has been offered.\" Paul Dadge, 28, the former fireman who was pictured helping Davinia, had seen her standing alone on a street corner after she escaped from the tube train. \"She was really brave. A lot of people were complaining about their burns but she didn't,\" Mr Dadge said. \"Davinia had serious burns to the right side of her face and left leg and her tights had been badly burned. She had lacerations to her head, and we managed to find a gel pack for her face. \"I helped her across the road to a hotel where they had set up a casualty centre. \"I spoke to her very briefly, we didn't have much time. I applied some dressings to her burns before she was taken off to hospital and I told her good luck. I'd love to get in touch with her and find out how she is,\" he said yesterday. Mr Dadge, now a project manager for AOL, believed Davinia was 28 years old, had a foreign surname and an English boyfriend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
