Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d After a pause, Biden added: \u201cWealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids, no, I really mean it, but think how we think about it.\u201d The remarks prompted criticism from left and right. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York and rival Democratic candidate for president, tweeted: \u201c\u2018Poor\u2019 kids are just as bright and talented as white kids? To quickly dismiss @JoeBiden\u2019s words as a mere \u2018slip of the tongue\u2019 is as concerning as what he said. We need to have a real conversation about the racism and sexism behind \u2018electability\u2019.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign also swooped, insisting this was not a \u201cgaffe\u201d but rather part of a \u201cpattern\u201d of racially tone-deaf remarks. The president himself told reporters: \u201cJoe Biden is not playing with a full deck. This is not somebody you can have as your president. But if he got the nomination, I\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d The Biden campaign tried to clear up the mess. Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, said he clearly \u201cmisspoke and immediately corrected himself\u201d. Trump, she added, was \u201cdesperate to change the subject from his atrocious record of using racism to divide this country\u201d. Biden, 76, already has a long history of verbal blunders. Earlier on Thursday, he referred to Theresa May as \u201cMargaret Thatcher\u201d, the second time he has recently confused the two former British prime ministers. At last week\u2019s Democratic primary debates, he urged viewers to visit a website that does not exist. Gaffes of that nature can be laughed off, but on race he is in more treacherous waters. In 2007 he described the presidential candidate Barack Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\u201d. His past policies on school bussing and criminal justice are also under attack, but Biden remains popular with older African American voters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
