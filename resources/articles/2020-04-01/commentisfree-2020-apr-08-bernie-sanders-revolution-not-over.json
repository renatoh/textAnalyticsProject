This wasn\u2019t an ordinary concession speech, but this wasn\u2019t an ordinary campaign or candidate, either. Bernie Sanders began his career in obscurity, first as a member of the Young People\u2019s Socialist League, and then as a minor third-party candidate garnering just 2% of the vote while railing against the \u201cworld of the 2%\u201d that controlled America\u2019s wealth. The Sanders message wasn\u2019t carefully focus-grouped or cobbled together by \u201cexperts\u201d \u2013 it came from his distinctly socialist understanding of how the world operated: the powerful will always get the better of the weak unless the weak get organized and fight back. With his moral clarity and anger, the Vermont senator seemed like the last specimen of a dying politics. He was stubborn; he refused to change, to \u201cevolve\u201d as the political climate turned. But at a time when mainstream Democrats were telling everyone that we could bootstrap ourselves to prosperity, America\u2019s brutal class system didn\u2019t evolve, either. With millions in poverty or feeling the pangs of hunger in the richest society in history, with millions more jobless, without health insurance, indebted and treated as expendable, Sanders knew there was an audience for his message. Since April 2015, Bernie Sanders has managed to conjure that potential audience into an actual one. He didn\u2019t create the anger at an unjust economic system or the decades of disillusionment with liberal politics, but he did create a clear narrative of what\u2019s wrong, build support for a set of policies that could make things better, and identify the agents of change that could bring a sorely needed \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d to fruition. The core of the Sanders platform has become common sense for millions of Americans. As he put it in his Wednesday morning speech: \u201cWe are winning the ideological battle.\u201d Medicare for All, free university and trade school tuition, universal childcare, fair trade and the protection of good jobs, living wages, and a Green New Deal that foregrounds the needs of workers \u2013 the most central parts of Sanders\u2019 agenda are now all widely popular ideas. And never has it beeen clearer who the enemies of progress are. Seventy per cent of Americans support higher taxes on those earning over $10m now, including 54% of Republicans. Imagine the shock of Democratic operatives who discovered during Sanders\u2019 rise that defending the material needs of working people is actually popular among working people. But Sanders fell short on the last part of his mission \u2013 mobilizing the coalition his political revolution counted on. He needed infrequent voters to turn out, and despite his early success, those voters didn\u2019t materialize. Decades of defeat and disorganization were almost overcome in a matter of months, but almost is scant consolation. There\u2019s still hope for the millions compelled to vote, canvass, phone-bank, and text for the Bernie Sanders campaign. As the present tense in his speech yesterday indicated, he sees himself as not a conventional candidate but a member of a mass movement. He said that \u201cthis race has never been about me\u201d and that he \u201cran for the presidency because [he] believed as president [he] could accelerate and institutionalize the progressive change that we are all building together\u201d. Bernie Sanders had hoped that he would emerge out of 2020 as a figure with the power of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, capable of using state power to institute reforms and clear away obstacles to working-class organizing. Instead, he\u2019ll have to accept his place alongside Martin Luther King Jr, Eugene Debs, and Mother Jones \u2013 moral leaders against the great evils of their day, leaders who will continue to inspire the struggle for freedom and justice.
