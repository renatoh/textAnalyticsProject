It is not often you hear a favourable terrace chant aimed at a super-rich American, and not often you hear a chairman describe his manager as \"awesome\". Martin O'Neill is cast in the role of dream-builder but this most individualistic of managers can knock down the blocks in the same breath as erecting them. But, for now, Lerner and his right-hand man, General Charles C Krulak, feel like a million dollars about Phase One of Operation AV. After the Americans high-fived at each goal, both worthy of showy celebration, Lerner pronounced his first week as chairman \"brilliant\". O'Neill summed up the day's mood: \"It's been a lovely afternoon. We're going great.\" But amid this Indian summer, the nights are drawing in and O'Neill can already feel the chill of Saturday's trip to Chelsea, the ultimate examination for his unbeaten Villa team. This will be O'Neill's first head-to-head with Jose Mourinho since Celtic's niggling Uefa Cup final defeat by Porto in 2003. Frosty was the only word to describe their relationship. O'Neill could have done with visiting the champions in five months' time, bolstered by January buys funded by Lerner. Asked for the minuses so far, O'Neill said: \"I'd be concerned about the size of the squad. Looking at all those names in the programme [referring to Charlton] other clubs have more extensive squads than us\". This had echoes of David O'Leary but O'Neill is living with it: \"It doesn't matter; we have what we have.\" His current team, O'Neill emphasised, \"is not any master plan, this is born of necessity\". All the same, they won with ease against Charlton, who under Iain Dowie's ever-changing deployment of personnel and tactics have already lost five games. A long, hard season is in prospect for a club that have now gone 17 matches without a Premiership away win. No doubt this record helped prompt O'Neill's expectation-dampening words as he looked at the top strata strata: \"Honestly, we're a long, long way short.\" For all that, even Mourinho would have been delighted with the quality of the goals here. The first saw Steven Davis, with clever footwork, make space to release Gareth Barry for a curving cross dispatched with a cushioned, sidefoot volley by the sprinting Gabriel Agbonlahor. The second sprang from a counter highlighting O'Neill's emphasis on winning the ball back quickly. Olof Mellberg stretched to clear a 40-60 ball, which fell to Barry. The captain's pass was long, quick and headed on by Luke Moore who sped inside into a receiving position. Juan Pablo Angel's response was a killing ball for Moore to drive home joyously . Like Barry, Angel is reborn. According to O'Neill the two young scorers, deployed on the flanks but normally central strikers, \"can learn from Juan the ability to hold it up and extricate yourself from difficult positions. The way he's playing at the moment he looks like a master at it\". Charlton could have scored early in both halves. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink drove too close to Thomas Sorensen and later forced a better save with a rasping shot. His side's flickering challenge ended with Darren Bent's header grazing the angle. Dowie was barking commands in the trenches afterwards: \"We've got to dig ourselves out of this hole. We'll see what the character of everyone, including myself, is. If we stick together we'll be fine.\" He could have taken the words right out of General Krulak's mouth.
