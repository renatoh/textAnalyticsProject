It\u2019s storytelling, almost character standup but the gag rate is higher than most one-liner comedians. Oh, if you haven\u2019t seen it just watch it, it\u2019s bliss. Paddy Gervers: Every time I see Bridget Christie she simultaneously changes my life and makes me laugh so hard I have to leave and lie down. She is utterly, utterly wonderful. The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen \u2026 JD: Cake Factory from Big Train. It\u2019s a very simple and tight idea and lovely writing but the thing that makes it are the performances from Simon Pegg and Rebecca Front. PG: My go-to \u201coh I have to show you this incredible sketch\u201d sketch is Key &amp; Peele\u2019s Continental Breakfast, closely followed by The Day That Robert Palins Murdered Me from I Think You Should Leave which is the sketch I most wish I\u2019d come up with in my life. The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 JD: I have very boring dreams. I once dreamed I was making toast for ages. I woke up and was both bored and annoyed that I still had to make the toast. The funniest person I know \u2026 JD: My friend Mike Bartlett \u2013 who I went to school with and who has since written some of the best dramas on TV and in the theatre \u2013 makes me laugh probably more than anyone else. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had \u2026 JD: I don\u2019t understand how a hairstyle is funny. Does that mean something you regret? Or are embarrassed by? I don\u2019t care how I look very much so all my haircuts are both wonderful and hilarious. PG: I used to cut my own hair at school because it had to be off the collar, so for years my hair was perfectly collar shaped all the way round. I looked like a backwards mullet enthusiast. The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard \u2026 JD: Colin Hoult\u2019s alter ego Andy Parker had the quip: \u201cNever apologise, never explain. [Beat] Sorry, I got that from a book.\u201d Jonny and the Baptists play Barnsley, Saturday 9; Newcastle upon Tyne, Tuesday 12 November; touring to 18 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
