Coming in unimpeded across the Pacific, it bends the tall palms low and scatters heavy fronds across the streets. On the pier of San Clemente, halfway between LA and San Diego, there are no more than three or four lonely anglers dropping their lines into the grey upheaval below. The beach has been so rearranged by the weather that the waves seem to be breaking randomly, while their spray drives across the sand like sleet. Normally the sea either side of the pier is bristling with the spiky tips of short surfboards. But the red flag is flying off the lifeguard tower and today only one guy is out, working the boulder-like waves near the end of the pier. He's a wizard and holds a clutch of people, huddled in coats at the rail on the deck, spellbound by the precision of his moves as he seems to leap effortlessly to his feet to zigzag up and down the slate-grey faces two or three times his height, then spin off the back of them, before crashing back into the ocean. Some surfers just won't miss a day. San Clemente is a quiet, prosperous little place. Its modest, manicured suburbia is fascinating and foreign, like something out of Edward Scissorhands. Up the main street, Del Mar, the stores sell essentials such as Danish throws, oversized candles and family acupuncture. This is gleaming, glossy southern California, where every car is spotless and even the sidewalks shine. No one seems to do much, yet you can feel the portfolios rising like dough all over town. Wherever you turn there's a blond head of hair that might have come from a Halloween store. There's something about the light here too; it holds everything still - the neat houses, the lofty palms. Once the gale blows itself out, even that ocean seems rightly named Pacific. It may be the birthplace of Richard Nixon, but San Clemente has other things to recommend it. A bloom of bohemianism has grown on the mulch of local wealth and survived, in the form of surfing culture. With several famous surf breaks nearby - Windansea, San Onofre, Trestles, T Street - San Clemente remains a bastion of surfer life. Old-time surfers are an indeterminate class, middle-class in values and perhaps education, but with part-time jobs like painting houses, making deliveries, and with clothes likely to have come from a garage sale. They look with bemusement on the 1980s marketing invention of surf fashion. Their subculture was formed in Malibu - 80 miles from here, west of LA - in the 1950s and 1960s, with iconic characters such as Tubesteak (so called because of the number of hot dogs he ate) and Mickey 'Da Cat' Dora, the 'Black Knight of surfing', whose gracious style on his board and rebellious, outsider attitude made him a legend. But in Malibu the culture has changed. The pier there has been renovated and the three breaks are crowded with a new generation of surfers, who go to college, have jobs and drive shiny cars. Things are different in San Clemente. The old scene lives on. The atmosphere nearest to this might be Steinbeck's Cannery Row - the 'Palace Flophouse boys' could be the original surfers, they knew what these people mean when they say, 'We're mellow here.' One old San Clemente surfer is Bob Foster, who began at the age of 12 and has seen three or four decades of surfing life. With his long ponytail and friendly face, he's now an instructor and surf photographer and gives my two young sons and me a lesson. Surfing is a complex activity, so it has not only its own elaborate, infamous shop talk (shredding it, hanging 10 and so on), it also has a long learning curve. But kids are learning machines. The boys can't get enough of it. They spring up again and again from the shallows to sprint into the foam screaming, 'Is it my turn? Is it my turn?' Waves, sand, a big yellow board, balance, speed - it's all irresistible to a small boy. By the pier we run into Todd, an old friend of Bob's. He has a sun-frizzed mass of blond hair, a face of sun-cured leather and that minimal economy of movement characteristic of surfers, who never seem to move or speak except when strictly necessary. 'Sure, man, Todd's a surfer,' Bob answers for him, after a direct question from the boys elicits no response but a raised eyebrow. 'He used to hang with the pier rats.' All surf breaks have their local pecking order and the 'pier rats' were the local surfer lords of the 1970s. 'Man, they never did anything but surf and drink beer. And girls. Boobs, tubes and doobs, that was their life, man.' What about work? 'They had this attitude, like it was a noble calling. I don't know how but they got by, especially when the surf magazines started printing their pictures and stuff.' San Clemente has seen all the recent decades of surfing - the laid-back, grass-mellowed 1960s, the partying 1970s, the slick 1980s when the moves became more radical and sponsorship became corporate, the 1990s when a lot of the 'grommets' (kids) turned into world-renowned acrobat surfers, and the 2000s, when surfing has more or less ceased to be countercultural. (When every other London solicitor breaks for Croyde on a summer weekend; when Californian high schools have surf teams that practice at seven each morning; when the industry is worth over $6bn a year in the US, and pro surfers spend hours a day in physical training, something has possibly been lost.) 'Like some dudes dreamed of the day when surfing would be as respected as golf,' says Bob. 'Some did,' Todd lifts his gravelly voice into the air. 'But like who was that surfer dude in Hawaii who ran for governor? His slogan was like \"I don't play golf\".' Bob laughs. 'Yeah. And he didn't get in.' The boys are all over Bob with questions: 'What's the biggest wave you've ever ridden? Can you do a 360?' His face lights up. He loves kids. Somehow that seems like a touch of wisdom. The strange thing about this life is that it's not pure hedonism. There's an unmistakable horse sense to it, of which Steinbeck would have approved. These are people who to a man and woman say that every day they feel happy to have the life they do. How many can say that? If you really know there's nowhere to get to, which perhaps you might learn if you've ridden enough waves, then maybe you'll stop and play with the children. Forty miles north of San Clemente is Huntington, the original Surf City USA. Set in a swampland filled with rocking oil derricks, it's none too prepossessing, but it's home to the International Surfing Museum, full of memorabilia, and to the Surf Walk of Fame - a lot of plaques set in the sidewalk of the main street. Its long broad swells are generally dense with surfers, especially near the pier where the best break is. The birthplace of surfing is Polynesia, but it was on Malibu's Surfrider Beach in the 1950s that the nexus of lifestyle and board design that brought surfing into the international spotlight - surfer as a man ruggedly outside the system, living in a beach shack, caring about nothing but waves and girls - was forged. People had been surfing in America for half a century before - surfing first came to the US in literary form, in a report from Hawaii by Mark Twain. He had a go at Waikiki in the late 1850s: 'The board struck the shore in three-quarters of a second, without any cargo, and I struck the bottom about the same time, with a couple of barrels of water in me.' Three Hawaiian princes - hands off a sailing vessel - may have had a go near Santa Cruz in 1885, but it wasn't until 1907, with the arrival of Hawaiian George Freeth - championed by another writer, Jack London - that Americans really got to see the 'sport of kings' (so called because the Hawaiian royal family had engaged in it for centuries, until the missionaries arrived and spoilt all the fun). London was taken with it. In the October 1907 issue of Lady's Home Companion, he declared: 'Where but the moment before was only the wide desolation and invincible roar, is now a man, erect, full statured... calm and superb... his feet buried in the churning foam, the salt smoke rising to his knees, and all the rest of him in the free air and flashing sunlight...' Hawaiian nobleman Duke Kahanamoku became the first ambassador of surf. An Olympic gold medal swimmer in 1912 and 1920 (he used to strum his ukelele before races to stay calm), Duke's demonstrations in California in 1912 caused a sensation and made him and his mighty 12ft hardwood board famous. Hollywood took him on, casting him as Aztec princes, Indian kings and the like. Then in 1953 a photograph was reproduced in more than 100 publications worldwide, showing Woody Brown (with two others) on a giant Hawaiian wave. He was a glider pilot who after the death of his first wife in childbirth moved to Hawaii 'to heal his grief in the aloha spirit' and applied his knowledge of aerodynamics to surfboard design. Many reportedly saw that picture and quit their jobs the next day to move to the ocean. Then came Gidget: first the 1957 novel by Frederick Kohner, about his teenage daughter's attempts to break into the male-dominated surf scene in Malibu, followed by the movie in 1959, starring Sandra Dee. Surfing broke out. Music followed - Jan and Dean, the Beach Boys - and countless surfing movies, especially The Endless Summer and Big Wednesday, chronicling a lightly fictionalised Malibu scene through the 1960s and early 1970s. Surfing is one of the few arenas in which waiting is enjoyable. There's a lot of waiting. The wind can be too strong or blowing the wrong way. There may be no swell. Even when conditions are right you can bob a long time in the line-up 'outside', waiting for the right wave . Even the practical demands are enjoyable. Manly things like tying the board to the roof rack and carrying the boards, 300 yards of which is generally enough to turn you into an orang-utan. OK, not that manly. And surfing is good for you. The deep absorption required to stay riding - akin to meditation - produces gamma waves in the brain, associated with happiness, heightened awareness and co-ordinated thinking. The risk, the inevitable fear, releases dopamine. Steven Kotler, a science writer from LA and author of West of Jesus: Surfing, Science and the Origins of Belief, is adamant that surfing saved him. After two years in bed with Lyme disease, he was ready to kill himself. 'I had the bourbon and sleeping pills ready. Then a friend called and insisted on taking me surfing. It was ridiculous. I couldn't even walk. But I thought, what the hell, I can kill myself tomorrow.' He had surfed years before, but once on the board, muscle memory took over; he paddled for the first wave and got to his feet. 'For the first time in years I wanted to be alive. That rush was so amazing. I caught four more waves. Then they carried me home and had to bring me food for two weeks. On the 15th day I got in my car and did it again.' He began to get better and gradually surfed more and now is more or less back to normal. If there is an issue in So-Cal surfing today it is crowds. The 1980s changed things. Leashes (scathingly known as 'leg ropes') became standard, which meant people could stay out after every ride, and the individualistic short-boarding style came in, which demanded more space per rider. Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s surfers had been thrilled to pile up on the same wave ('Dude, like eight of us were riding, cool!'), the individual ethos took over ('Hodad, you cut in on my wave'). 'Localism' is a problem. With local surfers itching for their dopamine and gamma wave fix, they're none too happy when a good swell comes in and 300 out-of-towners turn up. Fights aren't unknown, nor is the slashing of tyres . On San Onofre beach, three miles south of San Clemente, 'soul surfing' lives on - surfing as it was before the competitions and corporate sponsorships. Scott Morgan, a photographer friend, takes me down there, with a couple of longboards on the car roof. 'I guarantee it, this longboard will change your life,' he says, having seen me floundering on a 'fun board' the day before, having no fun. San Onofre is a famous surf break. It was discovered by surfers in the 1940s but after the war the military closed off the area, creating a vast training zone. Then, through the park system, surfers regained access. Today it is the mellowest beach on the coast. Its legendary palapa still stands off Old Man's Break and battered vans line the track by the beach. The number of bald and grey heads in the line-up testifies to surfing's addictiveness. They pad gracefully up and down their boards as they ride gently in. The waves here are forgiving. They seem to break without toppling over, so even I can ride in for long seconds, marvelling at how easy it is on my 9ft plank. After six of these rides, I start to wonder, unimaginably, if surfing could actually get boring. All that struggle, all those aching muscles and gallons of swallowed brine, just to get bored? 'Don't worry,' says Scott, 'you haven't yet learnt to turn.' Which is true. 'This learning curve has no end.' The vibe here is a time warp. 'Dude, you going to Baja?' a few guys ask me, as if I would surely be footloose enough to do that. LA, Disneyland and Hollywood are less than an hour away, but this could indeed be Mexico in the 1960s. The ticking of the clock seems to fade, time is measured only by the rhythmic pounding of the surf and the height of the sun. Time melts as evening comes on. We run into Bob Foster, who helps the boys ride in on long gentle ripples of white water, while the ocean turns dark. In the distance the lights of the pier come on and after the sun turns red and zips itself away the sky becomes an aquamarine vapour. A sickle moon rides like an Arab dhow between the trunks of palms. Life here is so mellow it seems to forgive everything. Have another glass of wine. Light that funny-looking cigarette. All is forgiven before you even do it.
