Barkley will have two years remaining on his current \u00a360,000-a-week deal at the end of the season and, as with the four-year contract he signed in 2014, Everton hope to reward the 22-year-old\u2019s progress with improved terms. Manchester City are one of several Premier League clubs to have shown interest in the England international in the past but Mart\u00ednez insists Barkley is central to his plans for the club, and that the boyhood Evertonian wants that role at Goodison Park. The Everton manager said: \u201cWe will probably look at it in the summer. As I\u2019ve said before, Ross is not a young man any more. He\u2019s a player you can build a project on. When you want to build a project it is about a player who wants to play for Everton and wants to take that role. It is one thing as a manager wanting to do something, if the player doesn\u2019t feel the same way then you cannot do it. \u201cBut at the moment we have to concentrate on what we can achieve from now until the end of the season. What you are going to do in the final 12 games of the season will allow you to have a real strong ending, and that\u2019s where the focus is. The FA Cup is another real strong focus for us, and the role of Ross Barkley will be vital to what we can achieve.\u201d Mart\u00ednez revealed Barkley is not the only player lined up for a new contract at Everton, with the club having an option to extend Bryan Oviedo\u2019s deal and Muhamed Besic due a pay rise after making over 25 Premier League appearances. \u201cWe look at every player\u2019s situation,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Bryan Oviedo who is out of contract in the summer but we have an option and we would like to do something before then. Mo Besic has triggered a clause which means we need to look into his contract. Those are the ones that are most imminent and everyone else we will look into in the summer.\u201d Barkley has made significant strides operating in the No10 role at Everton this season, with his two penalties against Newcastle United on Wednesday taking the midfielder to 11 goals in 31 games. His manager believes improved confidence, decision-making and increased responsibility have contributed to the 22-year-old\u2019s improvement. Mart\u00ednez added: \u201cI\u2019ve just seen a big difference this season in Ross. Before it was all about trying to give him information and make him a type of a player. This season has been very different because he\u2019s the one who wants clarifications and is asking for the information he needs. It shows he has the confidence he needs. \u201cThere was an action against Newcastle when he tracked Andros Townsend back all the way, and won the ball back. That wasn\u2019t his role. But in the same way that\u2019s the decision making we are working on. He sensed danger and reacted, and it means he has developed from a young lad who only does what you tell him into someone who knows what he has to do, and wants help in knowing what is expected in those situations. That\u2019s a big difference. When you do that it is because you are an experienced player who says \u2019I know what I am and how important I am for the team\u2019. \u201cHe has 11 goals but also creates a lot of chances for others, sometimes by not even touching the ball. He creates chances because teams are using one and two players constantly to try to stop him. His influence is huge and he\u2019s going to have a different test week by week. Sometimes man marking, sometimes two players to stop him and that\u2019s the test he will have until the end of the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
