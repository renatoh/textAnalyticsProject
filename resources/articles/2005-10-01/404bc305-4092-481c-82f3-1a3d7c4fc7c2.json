The government announced it was lifting the sanctions, which were imposed following an earlier report from the four-member Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) which accused IRA members of being involved in last December's \u00a326m Northern Bank heist. In its latest report, the IMC found that since the IRA announced the armed struggle was over in July there had been changes in its command structure. Punishment attacks carried out earlier in the year had stopped. But the body does not give the IRA a completely clean bill of health. In August, the IRA had attacked one of its own members, for reasons unknown. In the six months up to the end of August, IRA members had also been involved in extortion against businesses and the intimidation of people suspected of antisocial behaviour in nationalist areas as well as dissident republicans. \"It was impossible to say whether these had been authorised by the IRA's leadership,\" the commission said. The Democratic Unionist party's leader, Ian Paisley, said restoring the Stormont and Westminster allowances to Sinn F\u00e9in as a result of the IMC report was \"outrageous and demeans the very name of parliament\". Sinn F\u00e9in said the DUP had no further excuse for not sharing power at Stormont and the IRA had fully \"addressed unionists' concerns\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
