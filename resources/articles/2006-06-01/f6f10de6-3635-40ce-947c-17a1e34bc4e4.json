Born in Hungary, he lived in England in the 1930s and died in 1981 in the US, and designed everything from furniture to sleek houses to monumental buildings, including the Whitney Museum in New York. A testament to the modernity of his furniture is that several pieces are still being produced today - the sinuous Long chair in bent plywood, for example, is still made by Isokon Plus (isokonplus.com), the British company that first produced it in 1936. Perhaps the most engaging quality in Breuer's work is that it looks as if he had fun doing it: the Wassily chair, which was the first to use tubular steel, is supposed to have been inspired by his bicycle's handlebars. Living, as he did, through most of the 20th century, and filling it with so many beautiful things, Breuer is a designer who more than warrants his own show.

I know what you're thinking: this massive 50-litre Brabantia bin is nothing new. True, but what would make it better? A bin, of course, that opens itself. Like those toilets at Heathrow airport that flush with just a wave of the hand, and taps that come on when you place your hands beneath them (or, less conveniently, your handbag - I've seen it happen: Prada bag, Milan airport), the Brabantia Sensor responds to your presence. Actually, to your hand passing over a sensor in the lid. But the fact that it is operated by four AA batteries is somehow sadly ordinary. The Sensor is available now from selected branches of John Lewis, priced \u00a3130; 0870 240 7641 for stockists. Brought to book You could say that post-feminist magic-realism needs a bit of a helping hand at the moment, and it looks as if Vintage Books thinks so, too. It recently commissioned Parra, a young clubby illustrator from Amsterdam who takes on the odd design brief to pay for his own free-wheeling work, to redesign six covers, presumably to draw in unsuspecting younger readers. The series will be published throughout July. Angela Carter's writing is sumptuous, sometimes convoluted, and often full of sexual tones, of the over-and-under variety. Whether Parra's (real name, Pieter Janssen) 1960s-inspired hand-drawn type and block colours really represent the complexity of her work, or its more sinister side, is debatable. But it does demonstrate a suitable theatricality. Always best to judge a book by its cover, we say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
