It wasn\u2019t even Birmingham 2017. Back then nearly 10,000 people had turned up to hear Clean Bandit and Steve Coogan appear as warm-up acts for Jeremy Corbyn in the final days of the election campaign. On College Green in Bristol, sandwiched between the cathedral and the town hall, barely a couple of thousand \u2013 mostly students \u2013 showed up for the start of the Labour leader\u2019s series of whirlwind national rallies. Corbyn had hoped Bristol might mark the first gig of The Comeback Tour. It felt more like The Long Goodbye. It wasn\u2019t just the audience and the warmth of a summer\u2019s evening that were missing. It was the energy and the enthusiasm. Two years ago, there had been a sense of hope. A feeling that change was possible. Now there was just weariness, a weight of resignation. A commitment to a cause that already felt lost. The crowd had turned up as much to keep the faith with themselves as with their leader. The first rule of any lunchtime rally in December is that it should start on time. Even on a day of pale watery sunlight, you quickly get cold just standing around. The event had been meant to start at 2pm, but half an hour later there was still no sign of Corbyn. Several people standing near me gave up and headed home. There was only so much excitement they could take. One bloke muttered: \u201cI\u2019m going to give him five more minutes and then I\u2019m going to bugger off and do some yoga.\u201d Five minutes later, the Downward Dog buggered off. \u201cGet it on the road,\u201d another man yelled. \u201cOr we\u2019re going to the pub.\u201d The rest of the crowd just stayed put. They were here because they were here because they were here. You\u2019ve needed to be a stoic to be a Labour supporter in this campaign. Forty minutes later than billed, Labour\u2019s Bristol West candidate, Thangam Debbonaire, who had been jumping up and down to keep warm, and Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, took to the makeshift stage. \u201cWow,\u201d cried Debbonaire, desperately trying to inject some excitement into the proceedings. \u201cGive yourself a huge cheer if you want a Labour government.\u201d The response was a somewhat apathetic cheer. She tried again to provoke some kind of reaction from the crowd, but no one was willing to play ball. Too out of it, still pissed off the event was running so late. Or just plain hypothermic. Next up was Rees, who sounded more struggling supply teacher than motivational speaker. The words were all in the right order but no one had come for a lecture on Boris Johnson\u2019s racism, the failings of the Tory government and existential ennui. They had come to be inspired. By the time Rees had finished, most of the crowd had lost the will to live. Debbonaire looked round helplessly. Where was the headline act? Someone behind her shrugged. Haven\u2019t a clue, mate. In desperation, Debbonaire ad-libbed some of the highlights of her own set that she had delivered just minutes earlier. \u201cWho wants a Labour government?\u201d \u201cIs Boris a liar?\u201d In an ideal world, the crowd would have responded by singing Bon Jovi\u2019s, \u201cWoah, We\u2019re half way there / Woah, Thangham Debbonaire.\u201d But, sadly, this was no Richard Curtis romcom. Eventually, a murmur went round that Corbyn was in the vicinity and nearly an hour later than planned he climbed on to the podium to a desultory chorus of \u201cOh Je-re-my Cor-byn\u201d. At the last election this chant had come to sound almost devotional. A hymn. Now it\u2019s just a barely conscious Pavlovian response. The last vestige of a failing leadership. Not that Corbyn didn\u2019t give it his best shot. These are the gigs he loves best. A big \u2013 well, biggish \u2013 crowd with whom to get up close and personal. You wouldn\u2019t catch Boris getting anywhere near this close to members of the public that hadn\u2019t been prevetted: he can\u2019t do empathy and he hasn\u2019t the bravery. \u201cHello Bristol, hello West Country,\u201d the Labour leader shouted, before going into his standard stump speech. Nine years of austerity. Four million children in poverty. The UK condemned by the United Nations. Labour could turn this round and would protect the NHS. Of Brexit there was barely a mention \u2013 just one whispered remembrance of things past. He remains desperate to make a Brexit election about anything other than Brexit. Corbyn ended with a popular crowd favourite of climate change. At times he yelled so loud that he almost lost his voice. But he just wasn\u2019t getting much back. In the past these gigs had been mutual love-ins. Now he was pouring his heart and soul into his act and getting next to nothing back. The chemistry just wasn\u2019t there. People just weren\u2019t feeling it in the way they once had. They had come for a glimmer of hope. They left with the scars of a raging against the dying of the light.
