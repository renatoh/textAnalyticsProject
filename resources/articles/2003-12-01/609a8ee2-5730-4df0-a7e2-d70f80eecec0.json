Two complementary studies by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) and the Scottish executive present a detailed profile of local government candidates - both successful and otherwise - who stood for election last May. The figures reveal a characteristically unrepresentative local government, which the Scottish executive is working to address through its Renewing Local Democracy agenda. Just over a quarter (27.6%) of women put themselves forward for election, and only 21.8% succeeded, while the number of ethnic minority councillors still only make up 1% of the elected representatives - compared with a 2% ethnic minority population in Scotland overall. The average elected councillor is aged 55, with only 1% aged 30 or under. Three-quarters of councillors have no caring responsibilities of any kind, and almost as many (70%) are in managerial or professional occupations. Just over a quarter class themselves as \"full time\" councillors, citing a 43-hour weekly council workload. The local governance (Scotland) NHS bill, published earlier this year, is seeking to widen access through a range of proposals, including providing pensionable salaries for councillors, to encourage a broader range of candidates. Cosla hopes this will persuade a greater diversity of people to stand for local government elections, according to its president, councillor Pat Watters: \"The pressures that councillors - especially those with additional responsibilities - now face mean that it is increasingly difficult to combine council duties with a career outside the council chambers. She added: \"More needs to be done to increase the representation of women and young people in Scotland's council chambers. We welcome the increase in representation of ethnic minorities but here too more needs to be done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
