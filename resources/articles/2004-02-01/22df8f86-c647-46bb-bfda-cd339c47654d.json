The media group, which owns the Sun and Times newspapers and has a 35% stake in BSkyB, said its net profit between October and December rose to \u00a3193m, up by 50% from \u00a3128m a year earlier. Revenues for the three months to the end of September were \u00a33bn, an increase of 19% year on year. The biggest gains came at News Corp's cable networks where there was a 55% rise in operating revenues to \u00a3100m. The unit's profits were buoyed by strong ratings from the Fox News Channel and Fox's regional sports networks, while News Corp's filmed entertainment division saw operating income down fractionally to \u00a3136m. At the newspaper group, which also owns the News of the World and the Sunday Times, operating profit grew 67% to \u00a391m thanks to increased advertising sales in Britain and Australia. Increases in circulation and advertising revenues at the British newspapers were offset by the cost of launching the tabloid edition of the Times, the company said. The Sun had the largest growth in circulation revenue because of low figures a year ago, when it was waging a costly but ultimately successful price war against the Daily Mirror. The paper was the main driver of advertising growth, News Corp said, on the strength of classified and display advertisements. At the end of last year Mr Murdoch achieved his ambition of creating a global satellite network when his deal to take control of US satellite company DirecTV went through. News Corp also launched Italian pay-TV service Sky Italia last year, extending its reach in Europe, where BSkyB has 7.2 million subscribers in the UK and Ireland. \"Strategically we have continued to expand our global distribution capabilities with the acquisition of and our interest in DirecTV and the rapid growth of Sky Italia,\" Mr Murdoch said. \"We are looking forward to the unique opportunities these businesses provide us as we position ourselves for continued strong growth in the years to come.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
