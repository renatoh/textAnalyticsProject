Britain and the US have been seeking to resolve the dispute over bonuses by proposing that banks which did not carry sufficient capital should be required to claw back bonuses. But Merkel said: \"I have made clear we should not look for substitute issues and forget about financial market regulation.\" She has support from Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, who insisted a simmering dispute about bonuses between Europe and the US had not been resolved The competing agendas reflect Merkel's desire to mobilise German voters before a general election on Sunday but also underscore the tension between continental Europe and the Anglo-US axis. Merkel said: \"We have to make sure we learn the lessons of the crisis and make sure it is not repeated. Pittsburgh will be decisive in determining whether the subject of financial market regulation continues to be a central issue. For us, it is the most important subject at the meeting.\" The German finance minister Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, a Social Democrat, also warned \"vested local interests are being formulated massively\" in an attempt to influence decision making. \"Politicians must have the courage to do things which are not immediately applauded by banks worldwide,\" he said. He reported growing opposition \"from the City of London, but also Wall Street\" to act following the financial crisis. Sarkozy has suggested that bankers' pay should be capped at a certain percentage of their institution's assets or revenue. In a speech to the UN on Wednesday he condemned \"the behaviour of those who still continue to grow indecently rich, after leading the world to the brink of disaster\". Last night in Pittsburgh Fredrick Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister and current president of the European council, promised a \"specific discussion\" on bonuses including proposals for individual caps on bankers' bonuses, that bonuses would be linked to achievement and not given if there were losses, and that there would be transparency on precise decisions taken by boards. \"We from the EU will ask to be very clear on that\" he said. Last night around 300 people took to the streets of Pittsburgh to protest against the G20 summit. Police fired tear gas at some demonstrators after skirmishes broke out, with rubbish bins being rolled towards police officers and pallets and corrugated steel being used to block a road. Obama, chairing the G20 for the first time, has, with Brown's backing, been pushing world leaders to focus on a stronger form of global economic co-operation, including giving the IMF a bigger role in monitoring whether the major economies are growing in balance. Obama and Brown want the G20 to have broad powers to restrain imbalances that range from trade surpluses in countries such as China and Germany, to trade deficits in the countries such as the US. But Germany is also wary of any proposal that hands the G20 or the IMF any right to tell national economies whether to cut or increase their deficits in the model of the EU's growth and stability pact. Obama and Brown say the IMF's oversight role would be advisory, but see the process as a way of holding national governments accountable. Brown and the White House were forced to deny a breakdown in the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the US after the Guardian and other papers reported that Downing Street had asked five times for a bilateral meeting between the prime minister and Obama. The White House said Obama had a \"terrific relationship\" with Brown. \"Any stories that suggest trouble in the bilateral relationship between the United States and UK are totally absurd,\" it said. Downing Street accepted there had been \"numerous calls\" between officials and the White House, where \"potential meetings\" had been discussed. But Brown said: \"I had a long talk with him [Obama] after Monday's meeting. We are meeting today; we are chairing two meetings. The special relationship is strong and strengthening. And it's strengthening because there is a common purpose.\" Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, said there had been no \"frantic activity\" to get a bilateral meeting. Brown's former Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch-Brown told Radio 4's The World at One: \"I don't know whether they [Downing Street] were frantic or not; they shouldn't have been frankly so desperate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
