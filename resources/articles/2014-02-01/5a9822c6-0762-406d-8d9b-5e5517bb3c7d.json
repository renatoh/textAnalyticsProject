They wanted to try mixing Celtic and Latin themes, and the result was Salsa Celtica, a band that now has a following among salsa dancers in Latin America and New York, as well as among British folk enthusiasts. Their new album features 17 musicians, including Shippey, from Scotland, Cuba, Ireland, Argentina and England. The opening track Descarga Ga\u00e9lica sets the mood. Congas and timbale provide the backing for Megan Henderson and Kathleen MacInnes, whose rousing demonstration of rapid-fire Scottish Gaelic \"mouth music\" is intercut with a salsa chorus and trumpet workout. Elsewhere, there are sturdy Cuban vocals from Ricardo Fernandez Pompa, and jigs and reels given a Latin edge. This is a confident, exuberant fusion set that works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
