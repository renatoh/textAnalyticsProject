If he wants to prolong his career it's the inevitable step. I used to say that, if you played in midfield, all you wanted to do after a game was go home and put your feet up, whereas as a centre-half you could go straight to a party. A midfielder's physical commitment is probably at least 30% greater. In the centre of the park you have to do a lot of running to stay in the game but at centre-half it's more about concentration, awareness and reading situations early. Of course you need physical presence there but you can get away without being the quickest. That's assuming your thinking is right. The great Bobby Moore is still rated as the best defender we've produced but he was lightning slow. What gave Bobby a head start was that he was three yards quicker in the head than anybody else. Since the game at Juventus I've seen a load of comparisons between Keane and Moore. Early on Keane looked a bit shaky in terms of positional play and was inclined to let runners go, probably because he's used to having cover behind him, but once he got into the swing of things he was magnificent. He's played at centre-half before and of course he wouldn't be the first midfielder to switch there successfully. West Germany and Germany have often shifted their most talented player into the back line. Franz Beckenbauer was a midfielder to start with, Uli Stielike made the move and so did Lothar Matth\u00e4us and Matthias Sammer. Because they played in a back three they often had a looser role than Keane would, but they would step into a marking role at times. In any case, midfielders in England have switched very comfortably into the centre of a flat back four. Frank McLintock was an attacking midfield player who moved into defence at Arsenal. Frank wasn't the tallest, although he was quite good upstairs, but he was great at organising and making sure the back line was focused. At Liverpool Phil Thompson was an orthodox wing-half who moved into defence and Emlyn Hughes also made the switch. Before that, at Wolves, Billy Wright was a wing-half for many years before he went to centre-half. What surprised me was that nobody tried Paul Gascoigne as a spare defender. He's got power and strength and it might have extended his career in this country. Keane certainly has all the attributes to play at the back. I can remember seeing him play a lot in central defence for Nottingham Forest in Brian Clough's last season. He used to make cavalier sorties with the ball which would have Clough coming out of the dugout and screaming at him to get back into position. I'm not sure even now whether he was doing it to wind Cloughie up. Sir Alex Ferguson wouldn't have any worries about Keane's tackling or reading of the game at centre-back, and some people might not realise what an excellent header of the ball he is. But this season and maybe for a fair part of next, Alex will want his captain as a holding midfielder. There's no need for him to move with Wes Brown, Rio Ferdinand, Mikael Silvestre and John O'Shea around. And that's without mentioning Laurent Blanc, who barely gets a look-in. I think Keane only played at Juventus because Silvestre broke down in training, and I can't see him wanting to move back permanently unless he feels he can't give what he wants in midfield any more. He's suffering a bit with his hip, and I understand he cuts down on training before games and takes things easy after. But don't forget that his big pal and former Ireland colleague, Paul McGrath, never trained at all. The physical work Keane's done over the years should see him through so he only has to do top-up training. He's still such an imposing figure in midfield that I think he's best used there for as long as possible. At the back it's a lot about jockeying and timing tackles, whereas in midfield there is more close contact and challenging for 50-50s. When Keane's marauding there you have to be physically and mentally strong enough to stand up to him. No doubt plenty of Premiership midfielders would like Keane to move to central defence. But I fancy it could be a while before he feels it's time to do that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
