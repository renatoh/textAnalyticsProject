Audit Scotland, the country\u2019s public spending watchdog, said the NHS\u2019s finances were in critical condition, while its boards faced profound challenges dealing with an ageing population and rising drug costs. \u201cThe scale of the challenges means decisive action is required, with an urgent focus on the elements critical to ensuring the NHS is fit to meet people\u2019s needs in the future,\u201d the agency said. Its findings are a significant blow to Sturgeon, a former health secretary, who put NHS funding and policy at the centre of the Scottish National party\u2019s recent election campaigns. The first minister outbid Labour, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats by promising to increase health spending by \u00a3500m above inflation and has since won plaudits for giving NHS staff above-inflation pay rises. Audit Scotland, in one of the most damning reports it has produced, said health spending was inadequate. It found: Real-terms funding of the NHS fell 0.2% last year to \u00a313.1bn, failing to keep pace with costs and inflation. NHS boards had an \u00a3899m backlog in repairs that had been delayed to save money. Most of Scotland\u2019s NHS boards failed to meet their eight key performance targets. Eight NHS boards have forecast total deficits of \u00a3132m by the end of this year. Some NHS boards had to claim \u00a3102m in emergency loans from the government to balance the books. The Scottish government defended its record by arguing that many countries faced challenges in funding health services. It had recently unveiled a waiting-time improvement plan costing \u00a3850m that would \u201csignificantly improve the experience of patients waiting to be seen or treated\u201d, said Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary. Freeman said she was already taking forward Audit Scotland\u2019s 10 recommendations, which included more robust financial management and governance, a national capital investment plan and better long-term planning. She announced earlier this month that all existing emergency loans would be written off by the government. Audit Scotland said four boards forecast that they would still need loans worth \u00a371m this year, in addition to previous bailouts. The agency warned that increases in NHS funding forecast by the government, of between 0.24% and 0.59% per year, would not keep pace with increasing costs or cover current underfunding. Scotland\u2019s drugs bill, for instance, had jumped by 19% in five years. It said the Fraser of Allander Institute, an economics thinktank at Strathclyde university, believed the NHS would need 2% extra every year until 2030 \u201cjust to stand still\u201d. Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour\u2019s health spokeswoman, said the report strengthened Labour\u2019s call for income tax rises to fund greater health spending. She said Sturgeon had routinely ignored warnings about funding. \u201cHer inaction has put the future of our NHS under threat, with the financial and workforce problems worsening under her watch,\u201d Lennon said. Dr Lewis Morrison, chairman of BMA Scotland, the representative body for doctors, said the Audit Scotland report ought to be the final wake-up call for ministers. \u201cOnly through honest, realistic assessments of the scale of the challenge, and the change needed, can we hope to engage those who rely on the care the NHS provides in a serious debate about the future,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
