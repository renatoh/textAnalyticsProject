A crisis in British dairy farming \u2013 a narrative that sees the series remaining true to its original roots in promoting countryside issues for the Ministry of Agriculture \u2013 has threatened David \u2013 the grandson of Dan and Doris Archer, the Adam and Eve of Ambridge \u2013 with having to sell off his herd and cease milk production at Brookfield farm. However, with the show simultaneously milking a crisis in David\u2019s marriage, as his Geordie wife, Ruth (catchphrase, in extremis, \u201cAw, naw!\u201d), brooded on her problems during an extended visit to New Zealand, David risked ending up jobless and Ruthless. For the lead female characters in The Archers, this has been a period of keeping things close to their chests. Lynda Snell, bicycling busybody and amateur-dramatic impresario, chose for her seasonal production Calendar Girls, a drama about middle class women taking off their clothes, although in this case with the metaphysical twist of nudity that the audience can\u2019t see. For the past few days, though, the show\u2019s 5 million listeners (and the downloaders who have put the show at the top of the BBC\u2019s podcast charts) have also been offered a more traditional form of Archers striptease, in which the scriptwriters tantalised the audience with which of several current storylines might be the firework that ignited to mark Friday night\u2019s 65th anniversary edition. The show\u2019s landmark birthdays, traditionally containing a shock plot twist, have become a nervous time for actors, who can find themselves beginning the year with an ending. Five years ago, Graham Seed was written out after 28 years in the cast when his character, Nigel Pargetter, slipped from the roof of his house while trying to fix a flapping Happy New Year banner. Apart from the crisis with the cows and the vows of David and Ruth, another narrative strand with the potential to cause an anniversary flap involved Rob Titchener \u2013 the series\u2019 newest baddie, a marital rapist and nasty control freak. As the 65th anniversary approached, surviving cast members could take some reassurance from interviews in which Sean O\u2019Connor, the editor of The Archers since 2013, seemed to express regrets about his predecessor having put the skids under Nigel. However, O\u2019Connor also told the Radio Times that this birthday payoff would be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for the show and would mark the anniversary in a way that no other broadcasting franchise had done. On Friday night, between 7.02 and 7.14pm, O\u2019Connor proved true to his word. It is certain that no previous long-running drama \u2013 from Guiding Light in the US to Coronation Street in the UK \u2013 has ever passed a broadcasting landmark with a lengthy discussion of the effect on milk yield and profit levels of different methods of dairy farming in New Zealand, Ireland and a made-up place in Middle England. During her antipodean trip, Ruth had concluded that David should sell his herd, cuing poignant use of the show\u2019s extensive repertoire of moo sound-effects. But just as listeners thought \u201cAw, naw!\u201d, Ruth revealed plan B: the purchase of a new, smaller herd, presumably cheaper on the soundtrack budget. Actors Timothy Bentinck and Felicity Finch gamely played probably the only scene in the history of drama in which the punchline was \u201clow-cost pasture-based farming\u201d. Compared with the impact five years ago of Nigel\u2019s departure, some listeners may have felt that, in common with Mrs Snell\u2019s Calendar Girls, this was all tease and no reveal. However, the underlying desire of listeners for there always to be Archers at Brookfield farm has been satisfied for the foreseeable future, and, with several loose ends still to be tied, probably around Titchener\u2019s neck, the show sets out confidently towards its 70th birthday celebrations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
