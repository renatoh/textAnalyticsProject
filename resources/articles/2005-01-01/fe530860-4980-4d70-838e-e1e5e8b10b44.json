Originally a member of the id Software team that developed Doom and Quake before striking out on his own. Scrapland bears his stamps of quirkiness and ambitiousness, but is not destined to go down as a game of great significance. However, it will please those who feel that modern games have become identikits of each other. It tries to provide a Grand Theft Auto-style free-form gameplay experience, for the most part mixing action-adventure and airborne shoot-'em-up elements. You play D-Tritus, a robot that lands on the robot-only asteroid known as Scrapland, in which the Great Database allows the resurrection of dead robots. Unable to find any job other than the despised post of journalist, D-Tritus builds himself a hovership and divides his time between working and earning money by racing and engaging in aerial battles for the gratification of the betting-obsessed robot population. Before long, though, D-Tritus stumbles on a series of murders and embarks on a convoluted sleuthing mission. Scrapland has plenty of good points: its environments and graphics are stunning, as are its characterisations and surreal storyline. But it is let down by the action side of the gameplay, which is rather monotonous, although it does test your skills as a pilot, and becomes marginally more enjoyable when you can afford to kit your ship out with faster engines and more devastating weaponry. Those who prize quirkiness and originality, rather than adrenalin-inducing action, should enjoy Scrapland, though. Steve Boxer Assault on senses MechAssault 2 Xbox, \u00a339.99 Microsoft, *** Some people go for a drink or head to the gym after a bad day at the office. But for gamers there is another way - commandeer a walking robot and blast each other to bits. The original MechAssault was a short-lived romp, which came alive when played online. In the early days of Xbox Live, this was one of the best but that was before titles such as Halo 2 and Full Spectrum Warrior upped the ante. It is into this more sophisticated market that the sequel to MechAssault arrives. This is a violent and incessant shooter that sees players controlling bi-pedal mech robots around a busy battlefield. If the thought of stomping on tanks and mowing down tiny soldiers appeals, then this is worth a look. But despite some neat touches, such as the ability to \"hack\" into other bots and take them over, MechAssault 2 can only be recommended long-term for Xbox Live owners. The relatively simple shooting action takes on a new life when your opponent is from Arkansas rather than programmed artificial intelligence. Get together with friends and play capture the flag or deathmatch and MechAssault 2 makes sense. Stick to the linear and rather dull offline game and your attention will quickly waver. Greg Howson Not much cop Cops 2170 PC, \u00a319.99 MistLand/Dreamcatcher, *** January always brings its share of strange releases that wouldn't see the light of day in any other month, and this law increasingly applies to games. At first glance, Cops 2170 promises to fill a gap others have neglected for too long - the cyberpunk role-playing game, so beloved by fans of Fallout or XCom. If only the task had fallen to those developers rather than MistLand. Early minutes are compromised by an attractive but confusing interface and a terrible translation, apparently from the original Russian. With a heroine described as \"a naive child believing in good and fairness\", the idea that those qualities would make you want to be a cop places this firmly in the realms of fantasy rather than a grittier urban realism that might have served it better. With every level having a main problem to resolve as well as multiple sub-quests, you will soon get into the habit of clicking on everything and talking to anyone. Always interesting to look at, Cops 2170 is certainly keenly priced - but even so, non-fans of this genre might want to stick around until it shows up in the bargain bins for a tenner less.
