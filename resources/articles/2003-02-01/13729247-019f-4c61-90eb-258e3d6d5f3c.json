According to a report by the Radio Communications Agency, the government watchdog that polices the airwaves, 49 people were convicted for broadcasting illegal stations in 2002, up from 20 in 2001. The RA carried out 1,046 operations last year against pirate stations, equating to more than three raids a day. The conviction rate is the highest for five years and follows a change in tactics by the RA. As well as seizing equipment, it has introduced other methods such as warning record shops and nightclubs that they face prosecution if they are found to be promoting or providing premises for pirate stations as well as cutting telephone and internet connections. Stephen Timms, the telecoms and radio minister, said the figures were evidence that the tough stance taken against illegal broadcasters was paying off. \"The tide is slowly turning against the pirates,\" he said. \"We are also proposing new measures in the communications bill to strengthen enforcement powers. Police will have the power to arrest anyone running a pirate radio station. \"Pirate stations can put lives at risk by interfering with safety-of-life services such as air traffic control or emergency services. They also cause interference to legal broadcasters, damage property and annoy local residents,\" Mr Timms said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
