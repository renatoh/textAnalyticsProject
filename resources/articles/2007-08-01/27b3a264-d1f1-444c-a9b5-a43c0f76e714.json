He used to be KKD Karthik until he decided on KD Karthik. Then he plumped for Dinesh Kaarthick. Then he came up with Dinesh Karthik. How can you have a positive mind-set about shot selection when an autograph hunter can make you break out in a cold sweat of indecision? Karthik has reinvented himself in other ways, most notably from a wicketkeeper into an opener, and there was not much wrong with his batting yesterday. India's openers were supposed to represent a weakness before a parade of legends, yet on occasions this summer the middle-order powerhouse has looked more like a poor house and the opening batsmen have been far more resilient then expected. A 147-run opening partnership between Karthik and Wasim Jaffer at Trent Bridge did for England and here they put on 62. By the time Karthik was third out, at 199, India were halfway to the sort of total that would shut England out of the series. Karthik made 60 at Lord's and 77 in Nottingham and made 91 here before being caught behind off Ryan Sidebottom. \"I think I batted very well,\" he said. \"I was happy with the way I started and then I consolidated. It's a good toss to win on a flat wicket and we've got off to a very good start. But the first hour tomorrow will be very crucial because the ball is new. It swung around a bit more in the afternoon.\" Karthik's dismissal looked dubious but he admitted to a small nick. The really disappointed man was Sourav Ganguly, who took his appalling lbw dismissal very well - his inside edge was so thick that the ball would have sped through square-leg for four if it had not hit his pad. It is ridiculous, in an era of third and fourth umpires and match referees with access to highly refined camerawork, that such a decision should be possible. This will be addressed, in time, but waiting for it feels like watching a five-day Test in slow motion. In one-day county cricket earlier this season batsmen were able to appeal against dodgy decisions but it did not work because the umpires sitting in the pavilion did not want to over-rule their mates in the middle. An independent assessor is the only answer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
