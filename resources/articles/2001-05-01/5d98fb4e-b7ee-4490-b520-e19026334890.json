The company car is the prince of perks, a status symbol surpassed only by the chauffeur, the complimentary flat and the corporate jet. Currently, 1.7m British directors and employees drive company cars; in the UK, fleet cars account for between half and three-quarters of the new car market - which means that makers design most vehicles with fleet buyers, and company-car drivers, in mind. So even if you don't drive a company car, in a way you do. The society of company-car drivers is a complex one, with shifting and labyrinthine tax rules and a subtle hierarchy based on salary, position and model. At the bottom of the heap are the vans, which are company cars only in the most technical sense, and represent a sort of anti-status symbol. We don't think of Postman Pat as a company-car driver, after all. Indeed, as commercial vehicles, vans are not treated as a benefit and not taxed as such. But above the van drivers is the echelon in which the hierarchy begins to matter. Above the van drivers is the sales force. \"I've known people to change jobs for less money because the car package is better,\" says Dominic Williams, a partner in a printing firm (company car: Toyota Land Cruiser). \"The car is simply the most important thing for a salesman.\" The secret language of company cars is intricate and salespeople such as Williams must stay abreast as it evolves. Once, when companies ran whole fleets of a single make, status was indicated by model. \"The Scorpio was for the managers, and the Escort was for the new kids,\" says travelling garden furniture rep Gwyn Davies (VW Passat Estate), who logs between 35,000 and 40,000 miles a year. \"That's changed over the last few years. It's now all about status of the brand, with BMW, VW and Mercedes the best. You would rather have a bog-standard, stripped-out, no-CD, no-air-conditioning BMW than an all-singing, all-dancing Ford Mondeo.\" Car companies, ever alert to commercial advantages, collude in the game. \"BMW doesn't put any kind of badge on the boot,\" says Williams. \"So you can't actually tell when you're following it that it's bottom of the range.\" From order-takers to sales reps to area managers, company cars reflect the employee's relative worth to the firm. \"There is a certain aspirational element,\" says Williams. A classy company car is the most obvious outward sign that you're going up in the world, even when you aren't. Higher up the corporate tree, the vehicle that fills your parking-space - if you're lucky enough to have one - becomes loaded with even more meaning. At management level, the freedom to choose one's car carries certain implications. The kind of employee who wishes to flag up his or her ambition by driving a car above their station now has the option of paying the difference, provided he or she can also pay the tax on a more expensive vehicle. These days, many employees are given a sort of virtual voucher based on salary and left to choose their own car. But the rigid pecking order of marque, model and badge seems inextinguishable. \"You would have some guys whose wives earned more than they did, so they could afford to get a much better car,\" says Liam Murphy, a former management consultant (Rover 25). \"So the type of car didn't necessarily reflect your salary or the nature of the package.\" In fact, from middle management upwards, the choice of vehicle becomes a surreal extension of the belief that the car you drive says a lot about who you are. Murphy, who describes himself as \"not a car person\", nevertheless claims to understand the weird corporate philosophy which holds that company cars are a potent symbol for clients as much as an employee perk. \"It makes a statement about the business.\" An expensive car, he says, \"implies that your company has had to work to put together a certain type of package to attract somebody of your calibre\". As a management consultant, Murphy spent much of his time on professional secondment, working at senior levels within client companies, where he had to blend in, in the boardroom and the car park. \"It's all about demonstrating that you're part of the same peer group,\" he says. \"It's very peripheral, but it makes the small talk more useful.\" If company cars offer so many advantages in terms of status and peer recognition, there is also a drawback. \"It's the tax,\" says Gwyn Davies, echoing a near universal complaint among business drivers. Company cars are assessed as a \"benefit in kind\", meaning that up to 35% of the list price is treated as annual salary which, for most of those earning enough to justify the perk, means paying tax in the 40% bracket. There are also three tax bands for mileage and an additional, punitive fuel tax based on engine volume. In practice, this means that most company cars are under two litres. If all this were not complicated enough, everything changes from next April, when company vehicles will be taxed based on carbon dioxide emissions. \"The goalposts are constantly shifting,\" says Dominic Williams. \"They just screw you for having a company car, but if you didn't have the car you wouldn't be able to do the job.\" For company car drivers, this may be one of the most important political questions of the day. Almost as important, perhaps, as whether they drive a BMW or a Ford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
