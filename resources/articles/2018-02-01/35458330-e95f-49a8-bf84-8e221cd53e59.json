The European Commission\u2019s chief negotiator made the comments as a senior EU official told the Guardian that the clock was ticking on Brexit negotiations and warned that Britain\u2019s proposal for a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d after leaving the EU was unrealistic. The two sides have also clashed over the question of an implementation period as officials made it clear that May\u2019s demand for EU citizens arriving in Britain during transition to have reduced rights was not acceptable. Speaking after a lunch meeting that focused heavily on transition but also touched on the future trading relationship, Barnier said: \u201cThe only thing I can say \u2013 without the customs union, outside the single market \u2013 barriers to trade and goods and services are unavoidable. The time has come to make a choice.\u201d Davis described the talks as \u201cvery constructive\u201d and said that intensive negotiations would start on Tuesday and he was confident to have a political agreement by a meeting of European leaders in March. The Guardian understands that the commission wants the UK to put forward a detailed submission within weeks on what it is seeking in a future trading relationship. However, British negotiators have been urged not to waste time on demands that are incompatible with the rules of the EU. For example, Barnier has made it clear that in order for Britain to benefit from the single market and customs union, during transition, then free movement must continue during that period. That clashes with May\u2019s suggestion that EU citizens arriving after March, 2019, will have reduced settlement rights. The EU is also resistant to any suggestion that Britain could \u201ccherry-pick\u201d from the benefits of the single market without meeting all the obligations. The meeting, which took place ahead of the next round of talks, came as Downing Street was forced to rule out any involvement in \u201ca customs union\u201d after leaving the bloc amid anger from Tory backbenchers. After the meeting Barnier warned there was \u201cnot a minute to lose\u201d as he promised to accelerate talks. He later tweeted: Jacob Rees Mogg, who leads an influential group of Conservative Brexiteers, even suggested Treasury officials had been \u201cfiddling the figures\u201d to try to make the case for remaining within the trading bloc. In response, May said that the ability to negotiate trade deals with third countries after leaving the EU remained a red line for her government. But her spokesman did point to two alternative arrangements put forward in a government paper last year. One suggested a \u201chighly streamlined customs arrangement\u201d in which the UK would leave the customs union but try to use technology to speed up border arrangements. The second suggested a new \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d - and is increasingly being talked about by ministers ahead of two crunch meetings of May\u2019s so-called \u201cBrexit war cabinet\u201d later this week. Under such an arrangement, the UK would be free to negotiate trade deals with third countries, but would take the \u201cunprecedented\u201d approach of mirroring the EU\u2019s requirements for imports at British borders. However, a senior EU official said that they considered such an arrangement to be unworkable. \u201cThe partnership option is unrealistic,\u201d he said. He also cast doubts on the idea that the EU would accept May\u2019s suggestion that after Brexit Britain could continue to align with the EU by setting the same regulatory goals but achieving them through different means. \u201cThe idea that the UK will unilaterally decide where it wants to align goals and or methods - that looks very much like cherry picking or sector-based participation in the single market and that is something that the EU cannot accept,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd more broadly, what is important to understand is the single market is an ecosystem where rules develop and are enforced jointly and so alignment also means a joint enforcement system.\u201d The official stressed the timeline was short for negotiations and said the UK needed to quickly come forward with proposals to pave the way for a \u201cprecise declaration\u201d on the future relationship. \u201cThere needs to be a plan for the European council to work with. The clearer the UK can be on its future relationship, the more productive the European council can be.\u201d The government has promised to give a presentation on the question of the future relationship on Friday during Brexit talks, but by then the decisions of this week\u2019s sub-committee meetings will not have been put to May\u2019s full cabinet. EU officials and diplomats in Brussels have expressed their exasperation at the lack of proposals from the UK on a trading arrangement, and warned that ruling out a customs union would mean a hard border in Ireland. It is feared that, as a consequence, the problem of the Irish border will once again dominate talks in the coming weeks. The European commission is currently drafting legal text on the first phase issues - citizens rights, the financial settlement, and the Irish border - along with the terms of the transition period, on which they hope to be able to have agreement by all parties in March. But the lack of proposals on customs, and the red lines put down by the UK, are making the formulation of a legally binding text on the Irish border impossible, diplomats said. Some member states in Brussels are insistent that without progress on that issue the EU should not offer the UK the assurances it requires on a transition period. In a sign of the row to come, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, told The Guardian that MEPs, who will have a veto over any future withdrawal agreement, were determined to back up Ireland\u2019s demand for a solution that avoided a hard border. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to the UK to set out what kind of relationship they want with us and we negotiate on that basis. If the UK wants to put up barriers to trade that is their choice, though as a believer in free trade I regret it. Our priority will be to ensure there is no border put up again on the island of Ireland.\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission and Treasury official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said: \u201cThere is no plan in Whitehall on customs. This is the sleeping dog, as some have said. France and Germany are pushing the commission to be tough on this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
