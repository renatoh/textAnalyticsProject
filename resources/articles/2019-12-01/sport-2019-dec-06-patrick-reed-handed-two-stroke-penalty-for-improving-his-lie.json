Footage of Reed\u2019s actions on the 11th hole at Albany went viral on social media, with rules officials informing the 29-year-old of his punishment during a five-minute post-round discussion. Reed claimed to have been totally unaware of the affair until that point. As per the rules of golf, players can ground their club in waste areas but cannot improve their capability to play a shot by \u201cremoving or pressing down sand or loose soil.\u201d Reed remains adamant he did nothing wrong knowingly and that a single camera angle, from behind and which twice shows the Texan flicking sand during practice swings, is deceptive. \u201cIt was in a full footprint and I felt my club was that far behind the ball when I was taking a practice swing,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt was obviously hitting a bit of sand, though I didn\u2019t feel any drag. But when they brought it up for me [on the TV] I definitely saw it drag and, because of that, it is a two-shot penalty even though I didn\u2019t feel like it would have affected my lie. \u201cEvery time I get in one of those bunkers I am scared to get my club close to it [the ball]. I accept the two-shot penalty, even though there was not any intent as I was far enough away.\u201d On why he felt there was no option but to accept the penalty, Reed added: \u201cI think with a different camera angle they would have seen it was not improving the lie as I was far enough away from the golf ball. \u201cI don\u2019t ever put the club directly behind the ball in a situation like that as I am scared of it moving. Intent is a big part but with only one camera angle it is a 50-50 battle when you are being assessed for anything like that. I told them there was no intent and it was far enough away from the ball, but they didn\u2019t have another camera angle to show that and they felt it might have been improving the lie.\u201d Reed, who is three shots from the lead held by Gary Woodland in the Bahamas with 18 holes to play, appeared perfectly calm when discussing the scenario. \u201cAt the end of the day you have got to let things roll off your shoulders and I still have one round to play tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I stew over something, it is my word against their word and because they only have one camera angle, I don\u2019t really have a choice. After seeing it brush some sand, they thought that was a breach and, in the Rules of Golf, if you improve your lie, it is a penalty. At the end of the day you have to accept it and move on.\u201d Slugger White, the PGA Tour\u2019s vice-president of rules and competitions, issued Reed with the two strokes. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he could have seen it as clearly as we did but he could not have been a better gentleman. Intent would not matter here, that\u2019s not in the mix.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
