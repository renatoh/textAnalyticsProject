The first bomb, concealed in a white Renault 19, exploded in the Paseo de la Castellana - less than 100m from the Bernabeu - at 4.55pm local time. Six people were injured in the blast, while Spanish TV also reported that the Real Madrid trophy room and the Europa Tower, a large office block close to the stadium suffered damage. Fortunately the Tower was empty as today is a bank holiday in Spain. Real Madrid spokesman Joaquin Maroto, who was near to bomb when it went off, said that a \"massacre\" was only narrowly avoided. \"When it happened I was just passing in front of the Europa Tower when I felt a shockwave in my car,\" he told Telemadrid. \"I looked in the side mirror and I saw a column of smoke. I didn't see many people on the pavement but if it had happened 50 metres closer it would have been a massacre. \"We don't know yet if the match will be postponed. There haven't been any deaths apart from the scare and this new attack on our country. If there haven't been any personal losses we can continue.\" Police later confirmed that the bomb was on a timer switch, which meant the moment it went off was no mistake. Basque separatist group ETA has claimed responsibility for both bombs. Uefa have declined to comment on the explosions, but will hold a security meeting at 6pm UK time tonight to discuss whether the game will go ahead. However the clear-up job at the stadium was made harder by Madrid's ultra sur supporters, who fought with the police and threw rocks at them after they wouldn't let them up the Castellana, the main street towards the Bernebeu. They also sang KKK songs at a black man and tried to attack him But at 6.15pm Spanish time the police finally reopened the Castellana and traffic is now heading towards the ground. Barcelona FC spokesman Jose Miguel Teres, speaking from the Hotel Miguel Angel said: \"For the time being we haven't got any news, we're planning to travel to the stadium on time. \"If there are any changes, we will be notified,\" he added. \"The players are resting and the mood within the hotel is one of calmness. There are police cars outside the hotel.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
