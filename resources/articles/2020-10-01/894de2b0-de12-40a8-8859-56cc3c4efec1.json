It has been a long time coming. Despite a domestic cup double and an almost unbeaten season having meant that the 23-year-old travelled to the 2019 World Cup full of confidence, the pressure of her first major tournament hit hard and the criticism that followed even more so. She told the Guardian in January: \u201cThere were times when I thought: \u2018Is this actually for me? Do I want to play football any more?\u2019\u201d and conceded that she still struggled on England camps even then, six months after the tournament. Whether it is having had time to settle or a new crop of young players alleviating the pressure that comes with being one of the least experienced, Walsh is starting to thrive \u201cin my own head and my own mentality\u201d, she said after England\u2019s internal friendly on Friday. \u201cI was playing a bit reserved. Now that I\u2019ve taken the reins off a little bit and am not afraid to make mistakes I\u2019m definitely playing a lot better and feeling a lot better on the pitch.\u201d For that match, she was part of a formidable midfield trio with the Arsenal defender Leah Williamson and her City teammate Georgia Stanway and ran rings round England stalwarts Jill Scott, Izzy Christiansen and Fran Kirby, who picked up an ankle injury and is returning to Chelsea. \u201cI definitely feel more comfortable,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt makes it easier when you\u2019ve got great teammates and players around you. They\u2019re always there to encourage you and make you feel better if you make a mistake. That\u2019s something the staff have spoken about, that if you\u2019re making positive mistakes then they are not too bothered. If you\u2019re trying to play forward and make something happen then they\u2019re happy with that. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to work on.\u201d Now it is about taking the next step. \u201cI need to be scoring more goals and getting more assists. I play a slightly different role at England and City, I sit a little bit deeper at City, but especially with England there is no reason I can\u2019t be getting in the box and adding more goals to my game.\u201d Playing alongside her close friend Williamson in midfield was special because Walsh has \u201cnot played with her since I was about 12, in midfield\u201d. She added: \u201cWe\u2019re such good friends and it definitely makes it easier. We knew what each other wanted on the pitch, especially with Georgia in there as well, we spend a lot of time together off the pitch so in terms of the relationship there today we were playing a lot of one-two touches and it just clicked.\u201d Phil Neville said his management team were looking at combinations when asked about the fresh partnerships on show. \u201cWe put two teams together two weeks ago and we wanted to change the dynamics a little, play some of the younger ones with different personnel to see if they could handle different scenarios and different systems. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for partnerships across the pitch, where we can get them playing together and gelling together and making sure there\u2019s that connection in different units.\u201d The FA has struggled to find opponents in this run of international breaks. With the Lionesses having no competitive fixtures, having qualified for the Olympics through their World Cup finish and for the Euros as the host nation, it has been hard to get teams to commit given the constantly changing Covid restrictions. That situation places even more importance on the games they do have, the first against Germany, ranked No 2 in the world behind the USA, on Tuesday and then Norway on 1 December. One method has been to take a smaller squad to Germany than they have had at St George\u2019s Park to force players to play for a place in the travelling party. \u201cWe\u2019ve 28 in the squad but we\u2019re not taking 28 to Germany so there\u2019s a decision to be had over the next 24 hours,\u201d said Neville. \u201cEvery single player has trained really well, knitted in and deserves to go but unfortunately some won\u2019t.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
