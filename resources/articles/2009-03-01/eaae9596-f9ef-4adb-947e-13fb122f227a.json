That geographical hole should be filled in this afternoon when Martins visits Hull for the first time and aims to prevent a team that, until this season, he barely knew existed, plunging Newcastle into deeper relegation waters. \"I've never been to Hull and I'd never heard of their club,\" explained the forward who, during his youth in Lagos, considered himself rather knowledgeable about English football. \"It's quite strange when a side like this comes up through the divisions.\" If that sounds patronising, the \u00a310m signing from Internazionale does not intend to be. \"I did not know of Hull before but that does not mean it will be easy for us,\" he stressed. \"It's going to be tough because Hull, like us, need to win. We are going to try and bring back three points but it's easy to talk, not so easy to play. At the moment we are not doing well and it's difficult.\" Phil Brown's side harbour their own fears of a return to the Championship and, in recent weeks, have seemed a shadow of the vibrant ensemble which won 2-1 at St James' Park back in September but Martins' concerns are proof Hull will not hold a monopoly on insecurity today. Even though Michael Owen is scheduled to return from injury and expected to partner him in attack, the swagger has disappeared from Newcastle's once arrogant strut. \"When I came to Newcastle from Inter I came to enjoy myself playing good football,\" said Martins. \"I never thought this team could get relegated because there are many good players here. \"But, since I've been here it's been difficult and now we are fourth bottom. Everybody is not exactly scared because we still have 10 games left but everyone is looking at each other and saying 'something is not right'. We have not been playing very well and not winning so we are worried. We need a win to give us confidence.\" The dressing room mood was not helped by Blackburn's midweek win at Fulham. \"Yeah that made us anxious,\" acknowledged Martins who, like Owen, has missed much of this season with injury. \"When we came in to training everyone was talking about Blackburn winning. \"We were all talking about how important it is not to be relegated. We have to try and help each other right now. We realise the Blackburn result was bad news, it makes it more difficult for us. Now we just have to win at Hull.\"It is approaching three years \u2013 and four managers \u2013 since Glenn Roeder lured Martins to St James' Park but despite allying an ability to score with both feet and his head to the sort of pace sorely missed elsewhere in this Newcastle side, the 24-year-old has proved infuriatingly inconsistent. Much more an individual than a team player, he sometimes seems to serve as a microsm of the team's ills but, in mitigation, Martins has hardly benefited from consistent management. Accordingly it is no surprise that he appears unwilling to pledge his future to a club currently under the caretaker charge of Chris Hughton while Joe Kinnear recovers from heart surgery.Asked whether he envisages still being at St James' next season, Martins hedges his reply. \"It depends on the owner [Mike Ashley] \u2013 and which players are here.\" Indeed, like many a Toon Army foot soldier, Martins is displaying symptoms of fatigue. \"It's been a crazy season,\" he said. \"So when people outside the club talk to me I never speak about football. Never. I always talk about something else.\" Certain subjects are simply too distressing to discuss but Newcastle fans must trust that Martins' inner penalty-area sat-nav prevents Hull becoming a taboo word in the Geordie vocabulary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
