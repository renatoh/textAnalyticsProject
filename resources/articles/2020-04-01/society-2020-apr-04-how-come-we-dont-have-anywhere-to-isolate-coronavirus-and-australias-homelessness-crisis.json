Coronavirus and Australia's homelessness crisis", "bodyText": "Housing advocates are reporting a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d of rough sleeping in Sydney fuelled by the Covid-19 crisis and have warned that the virus could \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d among disadvantaged communities unless homeless people are guaranteed safe and secure housing. As the coronavirus prompts governments to all but clear the streets and demand people to stay in their homes to avoid the spread of the virus, the crisis has also brought a new sense of urgency to the issue, advocates say. While in the UK, the government has demanded that local councils house all rough sleepers in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, state governments in Australia, who are responsible for housing, have responded in varying degrees of scale and speed. Katherine McKernan, the chief executive of Homelessness NSW, said although the NSW government had unveiled a $34m funding package last week, Sydney was about \u201ctwo weeks behind Melbourne and Adelaide\u201d. This had actually led to \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in rough sleeping in Sydney, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a critical point now,\u201d McKernan said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to quantify the increase because everything is so fluid at the moment. But, [I] can say that there has been an increase and [it] seems to be New Zealanders who have lost their income and housing and young people in the same situation. These people are not previously known to services. \u201cWe are seeing groups of people sleeping rough congregating together, which is not good for keeping people healthy. There\u2019s a lack of food because the food services are no longer delivering.\u201d Census data shows that about 8,200 people sleep rough in Australia each night. Experts warn that failing to tackle homelessness during the pandemic left the whole community exposed. \u201cPeople who are sleeping rough are particularly vulnerable,\u201d Kate Colvin, a spokesperson for the Everybody\u2019s Home campaign, said. \u201cPartly because often people have chronic health conditions, but also because with a respiratory infection, sleeping somewhere cold and damp is dangerous.\u201d Despite the need to get people into housing quickly, authorities have failed to find accomodation for Marie* and her children, who is staying in Albany, four hours south of Perth. Sheltering together in her car in a secluded car park, Marie has found herself fielding a recurring question from her children. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Mum, how come we don\u2019t have anywhere to isolate?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s going to happen to us in lockdown?\u2019 I said, \u2018Mummy is going to do her best to get us a home.\u2019\u201d Marie, who is Aboriginal and fled a violent partner, said she and her three youngest children, aged eight, six and five, had been using public bathrooms to shower. \u201cHow do we know we\u2019re not going to pick up coronavirus from someone else?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to survive day-to-day. We can\u2019t cook anything, we have to live like we are camping,\u201d she added. A WA Health map shows multiple Covid-19 cases in Albany, a town of about 30,000 people. Marie said she was particularly worried about her five-year-old son, who has asthma. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to Housing every day, ringing them up. \u2018Where are we going to sleep? \u2018I\u2019m sorry, there is nothing available,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to stay in our car \u2026 I don\u2019t want to go to anyone\u2019s houses, I don\u2019t want to intrude. And I don\u2019t put my son at risk from getting this virus, it could harm him fatally.\u201d A spokesman for WA\u2019s Department of Communities said it could not comment on individual cases, but said it was working with Marie to address her housing needs. In Western Australia, the state government this week announced a \u201ctrial\u201d to house 20 people in a five-star Perth hotel. The pilot project could be scaled up if it was successful, the government said. But advocates say the program is completely inadequate in a city with an estimated nearly 1,000 rough sleepers. Jesse Noakes, an advocate working with WA\u2019s Homelessness Taskforce, said he had 35 homeless clients in a Perth motel who were set to be \u201ckicked out this Saturday back onto the empty streets\u201d. He said there were \u201chundreds more out there\u201d and shared photos of a homeless encampment in Perth that was home to about 30 people this week. \u201cIf this is wartime, where is the mobilisation?\u201d Noakes said. In Victoria, the government announced an extra $6m in funding as service providers move homeless people into motels, while Queensland has committed $24.7m. The SA government has also vowed to pay to accommodate rough sleepers in motels and is yet to quantify the cost of this plan. On Wednesday, national peak body Homelessness Australia warned more support was needed to \u201cprevent the virus spreading like wildfire in the most disadvantaged households\u201d. The peak body called for a national moratorium on all evictions, not just those related to financial stress, to prevent \u201clandlords from avoiding the moratorium and using \u2018no reason\u2019 notices or evictions for other reasons to evict current tenants\u201d. The chair of Homelessness Australia, Jenny Smith, said that the hundreds of thousands of people on temporary visas who could not access income support were already \u201cswelling the numbers of rough sleepers\u201d. The national cabinet is expected to consider rental measures at its next meeting on Friday. Generally, Colvin said the response from state governments had been positive. \u201cComing out of this crisis, we\u2019d really like to see what\u2019s been a good emergency response translate into an ongoing response,\u201d she said. Marie said she just hoped authorities would help her and the children off the streets quickly. \u201cI just want them to do their jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cHouse people who don\u2019t have homes.\u201d * Name has been changed for privacy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
