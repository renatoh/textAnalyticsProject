Research by the World Economic Forum found that the UK had failed to improve its 18th place in the rankings following a steady decline from 9th since 2006. As in 2012, the table was dominated by northern Europe, with Iceland first, Finland second, Norway third and Sweden fourth. But a number of middle-income and developing countries were above the UK, including the Philippines (5th), Nicaragua (10th), Cuba (15th), Lesotho (16th) and South Africa (17th). The WEF said the high rankings of poorer countries were mainly due to the participation of women in the workforce. Britain scored well for female literacy and enrolment in post-primary education, but the study highlighted room for improvement in several areas. The UK came 35th for economic gender equality but was placed 71st for helping women to find professional and technical positions. For political participation, Britain came 54th for getting women into parliament and 59th for securing ministerial jobs. Although the UK scored highly for education and health and survival, it was ranked 97th for healthy life expectancy for women. The WEF said many of the 136 countries sampled had closed the gender equality gap in the past year, but the study showed that the UK's score had remained virtually unchanged since the first report in 2006. A lower score for political empowerment resulted in a slight fall in overall gender equality since David Cameron became prime minister three years ago. \"Countries will need to start thinking of human capital very differently \u2013 including how they integrate women into leadership roles. This shift in mindset and practice is not a goal for the future, it is an imperative today,\" said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. The report found a marked split within Europe between the high-scoring countries of the north and the lower-scoring countries of the south. Spain was 30th, France 45th and Italy 71st. Burundi and Mozambique featured in the top 30 alongside Lesotho and South Africa, well ahead of Japan (105th) and South Korea (111th). The WEF noted that through economic activity women were securing greater access to income and economic decision-making in some African countries, but it added that many women were doing low-skill, low wage jobs. Saadia Zahidi, co-author of the report and head of the women leaders and gender parity programme, said: \"Both within countries and between countries are two distinct tracks to economic gender equality, with education serving as the accelerator. For countries that provide this basic investment, women's integration in the workforce is the next frontier of change. For those that haven't invested in women's education, addressing this obstacle is critical to women's lives as well as the strength of economies.\" The Philippines is the highest ranking country in Asia, which the WEF said was due to success in health, education and economic participation. Latin America's leading nation when it comes to closing the gender gap is Nicaragua, said the WEF. At 10, it has now ranked in the top 10 for two years, \"largely on the back of a strong performance in terms of political empowerment\". In a separate report, the Foundation for Sustainable Development said Nicaragua's deeply ingrained gender inequality, which stems from its largely subsistence, agricultural economy where women carry water and other basic tasks, is counteracted by charities and NGOs that provide workshops to women that improve health, relationships, and education, as well as cultivating successful microenterprises."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
