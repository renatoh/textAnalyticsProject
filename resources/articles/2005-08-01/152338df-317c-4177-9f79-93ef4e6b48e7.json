We live in a democracy and we need to keep it that way. Clearly, some of these are warranted as there is certainly a need to look closely at who is coming into the country and who is already here. But we have open borders throughout Europe and people are drifting across from all over the place; it will take a long time to put measures in place to stop that. We just need good intelligence and good policing of our borders; good intelligence is the basis of everything and it takes an enormous amount of manpower to keep someone under surveillance, but we are wholly reliant on intelligence and the police on this. There is no simple answer, but we need to educate people and deter them from the path to extremism. This will make people feel that things are being done but something like amending the Human Rights Act, I don't think will help one way or another ... and as far as integration goes I know people who have lived in Spain for 20 years who don't speak a word of Spanish.\" The Ireland expert Dr Kathleen Cavanaugh, lecturer in international human rights law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, an expert on Northern Ireland and the Middle East \"I can see a similar pattern developing in Britain to what happened in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the government felt the way to resolve the conflict and prevent political violence was to institute draconian measures, rather than address the larger problems underpinning the violence. Their attitude was myopic. In fact, the more draconian the measures, the more marginalised a community felt and the more support developed for paramilitary groups. We saw that after internment, after the hunger strikes and beyond. We could see the same thing in Leeds or Bradford or elsewhere in Britain, among the \"grey areas of support\", for example the people who broadly believe that the UK's presence in Iraq as well as UK support for US policy in Israel is wrong. You must have the right intelligence, be sophisticated enough not to bring the wrong people in. In Northern Ireland it took almost 30 years for the state security forces to develop a sophisticated enough apparatus to know that the people they were targeting were the people they should be targeting.\" The intelligence expert Crispin Black, a former government intelligence analyst, is a director of Janusian Security Risk Management \"Generally, I approve of most of these measures but the question now of Tony Blair is: is he actually going to do anything? I am not sure about banning organisations - it didn't really work with the IRA; it will drive them underground and give them a status they don't perhaps merit. Retrospective law is a bit problematic but my overriding criticism of this is why are we doing it now and not years ago? The retrospective nature acknowledges we should have done this long ago and I find that worrying. There is a sense that we are competing against yesterday's threat. I don't think they are controversial and the overall thrust is what a reasonable percentage of our population will applaud. We need to have laws like this and they will help a little bit although I would like to see more border control and some indication of how we are going to tackle intelligence. We need to adopt the French style of intelligence where people report or freely give information, with the communities themselves feeling they have a duty to keep the government updated.\" The commentator Peter Hitchens, Mail on Sunday columnist \"It seems to me to be dangerous because I don't know how you can draft these proposals so they don't become a threat to freedom of speech. There are already perfectly acceptable laws against incitement to violence and conspiracy laws against incitement to terrorism. It is not an absence of laws that have made these things happen. Banning political parties and classifying parties as extreme is dangerous because it must not become a weapon that a government, yet unknown, can use against people who disagree with it. Another aspect of this is that disgusting opinions, if spoken openly, can be challenged, argued and defeated. Suppressing them by law doesn't prevent them being thought. If you are interested in tracking extremists then it would be useful to know where they are gathered. Tony Blair's government has been opposing integration of immigrants systematically for 30 years and it is a pretty major nerve to be concerned about it now. All this is just posturing to look as if we are doing something. It seems to me to be, yet again, symbolic, rather than effective action, and I hope the proposals are thoroughly scrutinised in both houses.\" The civil rights lawyer Gareth Peirce is lawyer who has represented many terror suspects in the British courts \"There is nothing I can say as a lawyer that can adequately react to so terrifying an announcement. This is a statement of dangerous self-delusion, deliberately ignoring history, legality, principle and justice. Have we learnt nothing of the lessons of the past 30 years? Does the prime minister not recall the deluge of legislation throughout the lifetime of his government? What has any of it achieved and what will this achieve? The anti-terrorist legislation introduced already has been aimed inappropriately at suspects who are no danger to this country but instead has shamed this country's international reputation. This country, whatever it does domestically, simply cannot, without provoking a constitutional crisis, abandon its international treaty obligations, of which the Human Rights Act is only the domestic expression.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
