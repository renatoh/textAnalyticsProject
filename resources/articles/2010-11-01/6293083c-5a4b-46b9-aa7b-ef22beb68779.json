Progress takes their sound closer to that of the Killers (the blaring arena-rocker Underground Machine), Scissor Sisters (the glam stomp of Happy Now) and even Supermassive Black Hole-era Muse (the alienated electro marching tune Kidz). The real surprise is that this unexpected step from comfy balladry to something more interesting sounds quite natural \u2013 the only element that doesn't fit is the free-floatingly doomy lyrics, which foretell unspecified personal and global calamities. Williams, for instance, groans on Underground Machine: \"You're in the room with a rock star/ What a beast, what a man,\" yet you have to admit, the beast-man and his bandmates have produced a noteworthy modern album."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
