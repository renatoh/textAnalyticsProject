Wit. Sharp but sympathetic criticism. Piece after piece wonderfully well-crafted. We still miss you, Nancy. Angus Doulton Bere Ferrers, West Devon \u2022 It may be correct that Clive James had a \u201cgenius for expressing subtle thought in the language of men speaking to men\u201d and that he \u201csuspected other men\u2019s ideologies\u201d (Appreciation, 30 November). But it is likely that James himself recognised that women speak as well, and some of them even have ideologies.
