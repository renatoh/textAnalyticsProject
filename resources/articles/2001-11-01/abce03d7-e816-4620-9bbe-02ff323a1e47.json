Earlier in the day the cash-strapped Nationwide Conference side produced yet another Cup upset, although it was not in the same league as their 1972 defeat of Newcastle United. They put out Second Division Wrexham 1-0 with a goal from their captain Ian Wright. Hereford, whose lucky mascot, a Herefordshire bull, was banned from the Edgar Street ground because of foot and mouth restrictions, were grateful to their goalkeeper Matt Baker, who tipped a shot from Wrexham's Hector Sam on to a post. Forest Green, another Conference side, will also have a second crack at league opponents if they can beat Macclesfield Town at home in a replay after the sides drew 2-2 on Saturday. The winners will be at home to Swansea, who last night crushed Queens Park Rangers 4-0. Barrow were another non-league side to draw away to supposed superiors. The visitors took the lead at Oldham through Steve Housham but Lee Duxbury equalised for the Second Division side. The winners will visit Hull City. Hinckley United, the result of an amalgamation of two clubs only four years ago, earned a home tie with the league newcomers Cheltenham Town with their 2-1 triumph at Grays on Saturday. FA Cup second-round draw: Leyton Orient v Lincoln or Bury, Scunthorpe v Brentford, Canvey Island v Northampton, Whitby or Plymouth v Aldershot or Bristol Rovers, Tranmere v Barnet or Carlisle, Wycombe v Cambridge Utd or Notts County, Colchester or York v Reading, Exeter v Dag &amp; Red, Bedford or Peterbrough v Bournemouth, Swindon v Hereford, Altrincham or Lancaster v Darlington, Hinckley v Cheltenham Town, Mansfield v Huddersfield, Chesterfield v Southend, Hull v Oldham or Barrrow, Cardiff v Port Vale, Blackpool or Newport County v Tamworth or Rochdale, Macclesfield or Forest Green v Swansea, Brighton v Rushden &amp; Diamonds, Halifax v Stoke Ties to be played December 7/8/9"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
