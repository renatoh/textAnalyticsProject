After losing a two-leg qualification play-off 1-0 and failing in two appeals to Uefa's internal disciplinary committee, the FAW yesterday appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, determined to prove that Igor Titov's failed drug test after the first leg of the play-off in November renders the result void. \"Throughout this matter the FAW has always maintained that it would pursue all available remedies in an effort to obtain a just outcome,\" said David Collins, the general secretary. \"The FAW feels that Uefa did not give sufficient weight to the powerful arguments which the FAW submitted at the hearing.\" Middlesbrough last night completed a 4-0 aggregate victory over Aston Villa in the FA Youth Cup final with a 48th-minute goal from Jason Kennedy in the second leg at the Riverside Stadium. Plymouth's search for a successor to Paul Sturrock, who joined Southampton last month, is expected to end today with the appointment of the Hibernian manager Bobby Williamson. The news will be a particular disappointment to Colin Lee, the former manager of Walsall, whose decision to accept an interview with the Second Division leaders prompted the Saddlers to terminate his contract last week. If appointed, Williamson's first task will be to secure Plymouth's promotion, a task which would be achieved with victory over QPR at home on Saturday. \"There are a few things to be ironed out,\" he said yesterday, \"but I cannot see how it cannot go ahead.\" Plymouth are also believed to have spoken to the Clyde manager Alan Kernaghan and Motherwell's Terry Butcher, but a glowing reference from Sturrock appears to have swung the board in Williamson's favour. The former Rangers and West Brom forward guided Kilmarnock to victory in the Scottish Cup in 1997. This season he took Hibs to the CIS Insurance Cup final, where they lost 2-0 to Livingston. The former Middlesbrough and England captain George Hardwick, known as Gentleman George, died yesterday aged 84 after a long illness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
