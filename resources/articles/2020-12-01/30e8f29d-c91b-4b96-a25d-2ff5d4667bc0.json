Millwall. Always Millwall. Despite the attempts of many good people to soften the club\u2019s features, to give them a more friendly face, there is always a knucklehead element dragging them down. \u2019Twas ever thus for the club with the longest rap sheet in football. Do you know how long it took for the Den to be closed down because of fan unrest after it opened in August 1920? Less than two months, after fans threw missiles at the Newport goalkeeper, John Cooper \u2013 and then, for good measure, punched him when he climbed into the crowd. Millwall\u2019s stadium was shut again in 1934, 1947, 1950, 1978 and 1994. They have probably got off lightly. Throwing concrete at a linesman. Attacking referees. Ripping up Luton\u2019s Kenilworth Road ground. Injuring up to 50 police officers after a riot following a play-off defeat to Birmingham. The list of crimes and misdemeanours is so long that their latest indiscretion \u2013 booing as players took a knee in support of the fight against racial injustice before Saturday\u2019s match against Derby \u2013 might appear a relatively light charge by their own historical standards. Yet the action, and subsequent reaction, says a lot. Not just about Millwall fans, but Britain and the politicians who lead us. Remember Millwall\u2019s supporters had not been inside a stadium for nine months. The club has a shot at a play-off place. Saturday should have been a joyous occasion. Yet the first instinct of some of the 2,000 home crowd \u2013 all season-ticket holders, the hardcore of the hardcore \u2013 was to boo. Afterwards some supporters claimed their actions were not racist but merely expressing their disdain for the politics of the \u201cMarxist\u201d Black Lives Matters movement. The Millwall defender Mahlon Romeo saw through that. \u201cSpreading hatred\u201d, he called it. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is booed and condemned a peaceful gesture which was put in place to highlight, combat and stop any discriminatory behaviour and racism,\u201d said Romeo, a London-born black player who has represented Antigua and Barbuda. \u201cThat\u2019s it \u2013 that\u2019s all that gesture is. But in society there is a problem \u2013 and that problem is racism.\u201d It is hard to argue, although some undoubtedly will. But, in truth, this is a toxic sludge that goes beyond Millwall and beyond football. And while things are nowhere near as bad as in the 70s and 80s, it is worrying to see it poisoning our national game again. In the past two years, a Tottenham fan has been banned for hurling a banana at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang during the north London derby, while a Chelsea fan got a life ban for \u201cracially abusive language\u201d aimed at Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling. Millwall were themselves charged after a video circulated on the internet depicting fans singing: \u201cI\u2019d rather be a Paki than a scouse\u201d. And don\u2019t forget the England fans singing abusive songs and welcoming Tommy Robinson at the Nations League finals in Portugal last year either. It\u2019s not just the high-profile incidents. In September, Kick It Out warned of a \u201cshocking\u201d increase in reports of racist abuse in professional football \u2013 with 282 reports of racism in England grounds during 2019-2020 compared to 184 the season before, despite hundreds of matches being played behind closed doors or cancelled because of the pandemic. Last year the academics Stefan Lawrence and Christian Davis came to a sobering conclusion after investigating why anti-racist campaigns had not translated into a significant increase in black, Asian and minority ethnic fans on the terraces. In an article in the International Journal of Sport Policy and Politics, they noted \u201cBAME fans still report the same fears as were associated with football decades ago\u201d despite the actions of organisations such as Kick It Out. The BAME fans they spoke to reported not wanting to \u201cfeel the emotional burden when people are throwing bananas or shouting discriminative things\u201d, feared the impact on their children, and perceived they would be at \u201crisk of violence or racism at football matches\u201d. How would Saturday have made them feel? For many of us it is clear the Brexit vote in 2016 has left some feeling they can now uncork all sorts of unsavoury opinions, without fear of shame or consequence. And, really, is it any surprise when George Eustice, the environment secretary, refused to condemn the behaviour of Millwall fans? \u201cThe issue of race and racial discrimination is something we all take very seriously,\u201d he said after being asked about the booing, before pivoting sharply. \u201cMy personal view is that Black Lives Matter is actually a political movement that is different to what most of us believe in, which is standing up for racial equality. Each individual can take their own choices on how they reflect this.\u201d That comes dangerously close to echoing Donald Trump\u2019s comment about \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d after Charlottesville. It is also very different to the response given by Margaret Thatcher after Millwall fans rioted at Kenilworth Road. \u201cWe were all utterly appalled when we saw Luton against Millwall,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is build up a series of actions which first will identify the hooligans and stop them and progressively reduce this terrible scourge on football.\u201d True, Thatcher was no friend of football. But at least she was able to see what was staring at her in plain sight. Which is rather more than Eustice seems able to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
