The German boxing federation confirmed on Monday it was withholding $100,000 (\u00a363,100) of Chisora's purse from his world title bout with Vitali Klitschko at the Olympiahalle, pending a police investigation into the fracas, and the British Boxing Board of Control has ordered the London heavyweight to attend a disciplinary hearing on 14 March, when he is likely to be suspended, possibly for as long as a year, and heavily fined. That could be the least of his worries. Given two previous convictions for assault and the fact that the German authorities have in the past come down hard on professional boxers involved in public disorder offences, Chisora, as well as Haye, could go to prison. J\u00fcrgen Br\u00e4hmer, a former world champion who was due to fight the Welshman Nathan Cleverly last year and has only recently resumed boxing after nearly two years out of the ring, has served prison time for assault, as has his compatriot and former world champion Graciano Rocchigiani, who lost to Chris Eubank over 12 wild rounds in Berlin in 1994. Haye, who on Monday night had still not revealed his whereabouts, is yet to respond to widely circulated calls by the German police to return to Munich after fleeing the scene in the early hours of Sunday morning and to explain his part in a fracas that shamed their sport. The former WBA world champion gate-crashed the post-fight press conference to goad Klitschko into accepting a fight with him and ended up at the middle of a m\u00eal\u00e9e that left a cut on the head of his trainer and manager, Adam Booth, and ended with Chisora threatening to shoot him. It was this inflammatory conclusion that alerted the authorities. As Haye left the venue and packed his bags en route to the airport, police arrived and interviewed Chisora. They intercepted him at the airport the following morning and detained him for seven hours before allowing him to return to London on Monday night. Haye issued a statement on Monday afternoon promising to co-operate with the board, even though he does not hold a current licence. He went on to blame Chisora for inciting the confrontation. \"Chisora climbed down from the top table,\" he said, \"removed his robe and then walked towards me, entourage in tow, in an aggressive manner. I held my ground but, unfortunately, he caused a serious disturbance to occur. \"I realise I am no angel and I don't mind a bit of professional trash-talk to help raise boxing's profile but, during my 21 years in the sport, I have never been involved in, or even witnessed, such a serious fracas. If requested, I shall happily assist the boxing authorities with any investigation they wish to launch and, ultimately, hope that all lessons learned from this incident will be implemented.\" Chisora was more repentant. \"I feel I must wholeheartedly apologise for my part in the regrettable scenes both before and after what was to be the biggest night of my career,\" he said in a prepared statement released shortly after Haye's. \"Whilst my behaviour was inexcusable, there were many things that went on behind the scenes that ultimately caused my frustrations to boil over; however, this is of course no excuse. \"I cannot go into the specific details at the moment \u2026 Despite all of this, the bottom line is I have let my family, my team and, worst of all, the sport I love down. I acknowledge that my actions were totally unprofessional, with or without provocation.\" These were the first signs of recognition by either fighter of how serious their joint predicament has become. Whether they will help their cause in a police investigation they will discover after the German authorities have interviewed Haye. Booth did little to clarify the situation when interviewed outside his gym in south London. \"Anything that makes boxing look bad is a shame, because it is such a great sport,\" he said, while refusing to say if he knew where his former champion was, although he did say Haye would be happy to talk to the police. Happy might be putting it a bit strong for a man who has yet to show his face since leaving Munich and has ignored the repeated appeals by the local police to return for questioning. He will not be able to lie low for much longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
