Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, again. One more time: oh yeah. This could be our grand final. Odds are at least one team will contest it. The Dogs are a game clear of Manly at the top of the table and boast a forward pack as big and good, and as highly skilled as any in the \u2026 well, it\u2019s rugby league, in the entire world. Englishman James Graham is like two players: a thundering, shaggy man-thing; and a ball-playing pinhead. Then there\u2019s Aiden Tolman, Tony \u201cT-Rex\u201d Williams and a giant Frankenstein creature called David Klemmer who injects himself off the bench like a fist in a bowl of fruit salad. There\u2019s Josh Jackson, Sam Kasiano. In the backs their Origin halves, Josh Reynolds and Trent Hodkinson, slide back in to drive everyone around (and, in Reynolds\u2019s case, mad), while enigmatic wingman Krisnan Inu is an enigmatic replacement for Josh Morris, injured in the Big O. So you like the Dogs. But they\u2019ll do it tough against Manly at home. Eagles Nest Manly at home? The Dogs will do it tough. If the Manly forwards gain even parity with their opponents, and give Daly Cherry-Evans and Kieran Foran quick ball on the hop, these sometimes other-worldly worthies will stretch the Dogs like \u2026 something, I dunno. Something stretchy. The Spandex of God, say. Let\u2019s go with that. But they\u2019re good, the Manly halves, and you can be assured that Mr Reynolds of the Bulldogs will be sniping about and throwing himself at his direct opponents \u2013 indeed that contest should be quality, because Foran plays the same way. Elsewhere Jamie Lyon \u201cKing\u201d will throw many fine passes and his arms up and down like a bottle opener should the referees not be getting 'em onside or off the tackled player quickly enough, so inciting the Brookie Faithful into yelling at the referee. The Stewart brothers will run about doing clever things quickly, crazy Steve Matai will rock-n-roll in scary fashion, while the Brookvale Hotel will do a rip-roaring trade in steak and beer, and other Good Things of Man. Scorching Flat Earth Another potentially pretty good game on Friday night features the Parramatta Eels (7th) who are a game clear of North Queensland Cowboys (11th), a battle between the comp\u2019s most unlikely comp-threateners (truly, if you\u2019d said before the season that halfway through Parra would be two wins out of top spot you\u2019d have been mocked like a Flat Earther) against Cowboys of the north with their best players back. The Eels have played carefree footy this year, and lit up the odd night. They\u2019ve been really good, Parra. And they\u2019ve got their superstar fullback back, a funky hep-cat approaching the form of 2009 that won him the Dally M medal. (Oh yes, Jarryd Hayne is his name, AKA Hayne Plane, AKA Hayne Train, AKA Jarryd). The Cowboys, meanwhile, have scored 266 points in 12 games (an average of 22 per) which puts them fourth overall just behind the Roosters and Warriors (on 270) and Broncos (268). Their halfback Johnathan Thurston is so good he just about owns Townsville. Truly. He owns the keys to the city. He can walk into anyone\u2019s house and take their DVD player, and no one would say a thing. Indeed they\u2019d be honoured, and load him up with other stuff. Should be a good one. Goldie Bean Up on the Gold Coast, the stupidly-named CBUS Super Stadium will host the round\u2019s least interesting fixture between Gold Coast Titans and Penrith Panthers. Something about these teams is just sort of \u2026 myeah. That said, whatever that is, Panthers fullback Matt Moylan can run like the proverbial shower of shit (an expression that you\u2019d think means the opposite of fast, or good, yet still works, somehow \u2013 silly language we speak) while the Titans trot out Albert Kelly in the No. 7, and he can bounce about like a bean in a pan held by a prospector from cowboy times. My but I can go on. Good players, though, this pair, and actually it could be quite a good game given the velvet surface of CBUS Super Stadium, the probable fair weather prevalent in Australia\u2019s Holiday Land, and that there\u2019s only a game between the teams and they look evenly matched. Titans by two. Or Panthers by 36. Nostradamus I am not. And nor are you. So screw you, Hans Brix. Some other games Elsewhere Dragons or Sharks will give us an insight into this year\u2019s wooden spoon by losing to a favourite for the wooden spoon; the Rabbitohs will play New Zealand Warriors in Perth, as one does; the Tinkler-less Knights play the Tedesco-infused Tigers at Hunter Stadium; subdued Storm play rampant Roosters at AAMI Park; before the round is rounded out when Raiders and Broncos run about in the wet night dew of a Monday night in Canberra, the journalists sitting in the National Rugby League\u2019s only outdoor media centre. Someone in Canberra has a superb sense of humour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
