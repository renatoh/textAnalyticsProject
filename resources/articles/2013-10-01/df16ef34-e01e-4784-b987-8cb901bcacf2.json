This is a warmly, in fact outrageously sentimental and self-congratulatory film from Disney about the master himself: the story of how in 1961 the wily genius Walt Disney \u2013 likably played by Tom Hanks \u2013 persuaded the grumpy British dame PL Travers to come to Los Angeles and begin talks to sign away the screen rights to her legendary creation, Mary Poppins. It was a project Walt had been working on for 20 years. The director is John Lee Hancock, who made the intensely patriotic football picture The Blind Side. Gimlet of eye, pursed of lip, uptight of demeanour, Travers is terribly suspicious of Hollywood razzmatazz; she is played by Emma Thompson, a double Oscar-winner for writing and acting who is nonetheless best known to younger audiences now from the smash-hit Nanny McPhee films. Will starchy old Travers finally get thawed by Walt's rich warmth? Will she abandon her haughty resistance to his folksiness and schmaltz? And can this intensely American figure faithfully represent the quintessential Britishness of the Mary Poppins story? Well, if you've heard Dick Van Dyke's Cockney accent in Meery Parpins you know the sad answer to that last question. The rest you can guess. Only a Disney film would have had the rights to the Mary Poppins clips and only a Disney film would have been permitted the possible lese-majesty of representing the great man on screen. Perhaps one day soon a 20th Century Fox film will dramatise that legendary incident when Rupert Murdoch took Terrence Malick out to dinner at the Cannes film festival: Ben Mendelsohn can reprise his performance as Rupe and Jeff Bridges can be Terrence. None of the Poppins cast of Andrews, Van Dyke, Tomlinson et al is shown in this movie, it's just the backroom players. Aside from Walt and Travers, the harassed Disney executive Don DaGradi is played by Bradley Whitford and the songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman \u2013 frantically perky and experimentally hammering out provisional sketches for Supercalifragilistic and Let's All Fly A Kite on the piano \u2013 are played by Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak. It's a courtship of sorts, a platonic special relationship seduction, with some U-certificate daddy issues. The longer the film goes on \u2013 and it does go on \u2013 the more you realise that Hanks and Thompson are born to play Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Hanks's Disney is positively presidential, forever getting up from behind his desk to greet visitors, with two layers of outer office, two secretaries, staff who jump to attention when he appears. This is the man who 30 years previously had famously acted out the entire story of his proposed Snow White and the Seven Dwarves animation, doing all the characters' faces and voices, for the benefit of his awestruck animation team. I'd like to see Hanks portray that seminal moment in film history, but he is limited here to an extended cameo. It is entertaining, though, and Disney's snake oil charm and hint of steel are well packaged by Hanks. Without him, this would be pretty bland. The film is let down by a recurring flashback to Travers's tough childhood in Australia, dominated by a roguish, hard-drinking dad she adored \u2013 played blandly and without much inspiration by Colin Farrell. They really were a hard-pressed family who needed someone to fly in to save them. This backstory is in fact a syrupy and rather dull Disney film \u2013 a sort of depressing version of Pollyanna or Anne Of Green Gables \u2013 which runs alongside the racy Hollywood-insider gossip. Strangely, it suggests a more agonised relationship between Travers and her hopeless dad than appears initially to be the case, a terrible and very specific weight of guilt to which this determinedly cheerful film can't quite do justice. Saving Mr Banks is an indulgent, overlong picture which is always on the verge of becoming a mess. Thankfully, reliable old Tom Hanks snaps his fingers and \u2013 spit, spot \u2013 everything more or less gets cleared away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
