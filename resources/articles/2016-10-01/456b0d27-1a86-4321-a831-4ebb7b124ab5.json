Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne has backed Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s version, saying there \u201cwas certainly a deal to put a sunset clause on the temporary ban\u201d. The differing accounts on Friday morning follow a clash on Thursday, where Turnbull, Peter Dutton and Michael Keenan directly contradicted the former prime minister\u2019s insistence that neither he nor his office authorised a deal with Liberal Democratic party senator Leyonhjelm on gun control in 2015. The showdown was triggered by a declaration from Abbott earlier in the week that as far as he and his office were concerned, there had been no deal with Leyonhjelm. On Thursday morning, Abbott was told by Dutton during a meeting between the two men that he might want to issue a clarifying statement, given there was evidence his office knew about the talks in the Senate in 2015. Some government sources say Abbott agreed to issue a statement, but others say he declined to do so, arguing that would inflame the situation. The former prime minister entered question time on Thursday with a statement prepared, which he delivered at the conclusion of question time. On Friday state attorneys general, justice and police ministers will meet in Melbourne to discuss firearms, including the classification of the Adler. The federal government has not ruled out lifting the Adler importation ban after the classification is agreed, and has not stated its preferred classification for the weapon. Asked on ABC AM about the alleged deal, Sukkar said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there necessarily is strong evidence that there was any horse trading going on. \u201cI know that discussions would\u2019ve been taking place, and from the publicly available information there certainly were discussions.\u201d Leyonhjelm has produced correspondence from August 2015 documenting his discussions with Dutton and Keenan which suggests he agreed to give support to non-related migration legislation in return for the government\u2019s agreement to sunset the ban on the Adler. In question time on Thursday Turnbull said he had made inquiries of \u201cmy ministers, and can say to the House as a result of those inquiries I\u2019m satisfied that the minister for justice acted in the full knowledge of the prime minister\u2019s office at that time\u201d. Abbott produced an adviser\u2019s note dated 23 July referring to a \u201ctemporary ban\u201d which he suggested showed the government\u2019s position was not changed for Leyonhjelm. Sukkar said: \u201cMy understanding is a decision was taken early that the ban on this ban should be put in place ... for a period of 12 months with the expectation from the justice minister this would be wrapped up in the [council of Australian governments] process.\u201d Sukkar said when that didn\u2019t happen the Turnbull government \u201cvery decisively\u201d continued the ban. He said Turnbull and Abbott\u2019s positions could be \u201cquite easily reconciled\u201d, because there was an in-principle decision to ban the Adler and Leyonhjelm \u201cthought he\u2019d extracted some huge concession from the government about a decision that had already been made\u201d. On Channel Nine\u2019s Today program on Friday, Pyne said there was no deal to water down John Howard\u2019s gun laws but \u201cthere was certainly a deal to put a sunset clause on the temporary ban because we wanted to make sure that the states and territories visited this subject and classified this particular weapon\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the government knew about it because Michael Keenan and Peter Dutton made the arrangement to ensure that this matter didn\u2019t just sit there forever on the books,\u201d he said. Pyne said nobody in the government is at odds about gun laws and it was \u201crubbish\u201d that Turnbull had effectively called Abbott a liar. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, told ABC News Breakfast that Abbott had \u201cwas actually not contradicting Malcolm Turnbull\u201d but rather putting the \u201cfocus back on to the Labor party\u201d for not backing tougher gun control. Asked about tension between the pair, he said: \u201cWell, there was a leadership change. You can understand the differences they may have on particular issues.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re at one, actually, when it comes to the prohibition of the Adler shotgun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
