But the first competitive meeting of the city's two professional clubs in almost a decade went close to disproving that theory as a hugely courageous performance by the Super League newcomers Rovers gave last year's Old Trafford grand finalists an almighty scare. Rovers seemed in danger of being blown away as the black and whites of Hull FC took a 12-0 lead inside the first quarter inspired by Paul Cooke, their maverick stand-off, who grew up supporting Hull KR and went to watch their game against Catalans Dragons on Good Friday with his mum when a hamstring injury prevented him from travelling down to Harlequins with his team-mates. But the Robins ensured that a memorable occasion received the contest it merited by battling back to trail by two points midway through the second half, and the increasingly jittery home players and supporters could not relax until Sid Domic surged over for their fourth try in stoppage time. There was certainly nothing jubilant about Hull's Australian coach Peter Sharp afterwards. \"I'm doing cartwheels inside,\" he insisted after being teased about his downbeat demeanour, but there was little in this performance to suggest that Hull are ready to surge up from their current position in the bottom four and re-establish themselves as genuine title challengers. \"Yes, it's nice to win the derby but more important for us were the two points,\" Sharp added. \"If we were a bit smarter we could have done that a bit easier. We're committing rugby league suicide at the moment with poor discipline and unforced errors.\" For 20 minutes they had come close to regaining last year's standards, thanks largely to the return of Cooke. He set up the opening try with a long, floated pass to the left wing that allowed Gareth Raynor to send Danny Tickle crashing over on his inside. Eleven minutes later the stand-off provided the final pass for Shaun Briscoe to burst through some weak Rovers defending for a second. But as Cooke tired - inevitably, in only his second appearance of the season - Hull lost their direction and Rovers grew in confidence, finally breaking their duck when their excellent scrum-half James Webster sent Luke Dyer over. After a breather at half-time Cooke set up a third try with another sumptuous long pass, this time for Matt Sing to cross on the left to establish a 16-4 lead. But a bad mistake by the otherwise excellent Briscoe gifted Rovers the position for David Tangata-Toa to crash over to bring them back into the game and six minutes later Andreas Bauer punished another error, this time by Sing, for a try which gave Scott Murrell the chance to equalise. However his tricky conversion attempt drifted wide and Hull clung on to that uncomfortably narrow lead until the 199th derby was finally settled by Domic, an Aboriginal artist from Rockhampton in northern Queensland. \"I know what rugby league means to the fans in this town and the occasion was everything it was built up to be,\" said the Rovers coach Justin Morgan, another Australian who was rightly proud of his team's efforts, despite this fifth consecutive defeat.
