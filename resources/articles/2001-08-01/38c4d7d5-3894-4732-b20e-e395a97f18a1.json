The consensus among City analysts was that the Bank would keep rates unchanged, as it did last month. But the pace of events has forced the Bank to act. Companies around the world have been announcing plans to axe thousands of workers with depressing regularity. Last week, NTL, Britain's largest cable communications company, said it would cut up to 5,000 jobs over the next two years. Britain's manufacturing sector, already under pressure from a strong pound, is now reeling from a world economic slowdown. In the second quarter, economic growth dropped to 0.3%, its slowest pace for years, as the effects of a weakening US economy begin to bite over here. The Trades Union Congress predicts that at least 100,000 manufacturing jobs will go by the end of the year as the UK heads towards a recession. It is not only the unions that are worried - so are organisations representing industry, such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors. Analysts had expected the Bank to hold fire because of signs of inflationary pressure. Blithely ignoring the gathering economic storm clouds, consumers have been shopping until they drop. Most retailers are still reporting higher sales than a year ago in Britain's two-speed economy, where a slumping manufacturing sector goes hand in hand with free-spending consumers and spiralling house prices. The Bank will also have been aware of recent evidence of pay rises outstripping inflation, especially in the public sector, as the government tries to make good on its promise to improve delivery of public services. But, as some MPC members have argued, the Bank's inflation fears can be overstated. Sushil Wadhwani, a recent addition to the committee, has been arguing for a rate cut in recent meetings, as shown in the published minutes of policy meetings. He points out that the MPC has been undershooting its inflation target of 2.5% for some time. While food prices have risen because of the foot and mouth outbreak - and may push inflation above 2.5% over the next few months - they will come down again as the crisis eases. A survey of the landscape points shows the bleak prospects for growth. The US economy is slowing, so are the economies of mainland Europe, notably Germany, and Japan remains in the doldrums despite repeated attempts to stimulate the economy. Against this backdrop, and as job losses feed into the unemployment figures in the UK, consumers can be expected to rein in spending later in the year. The Bank has now cut rates four times this year, bringing them down to their current level of 5%. By doing so, it realises that recession rather than inflation poses the greater threat to the British economy. But the European Central Bank (ECB) seems to be fighting the last war. It announced today that it was leaving rates unchanged in its last council meeting before its August break.
