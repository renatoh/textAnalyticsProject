The Everton and Wigan Athletic managers yesterday praised Avram Grant for guiding the financially stricken club to the FA Cup final, but were adamant the penalties of administration should be accepted. Portsmouth are seeking a Uefa licence to play in the Europa League next season having become ineligible once they were unable to file audited accounts to the Football Association last month, but Moyes believes their appeal should be rejected. \"If Portsmouth earn it they deserve it but if you don't apply to go into it, and don't do the right things, then you can't expect to be in there,\" the Everton manager argued. \"I have sympathy with the situation the club are in, and what Avram has done is nothing short of miraculous under the circumstances. You'd have to ask why Portsmouth didn't apply. \"Did they not apply because they didn't think they were going to make it? Then maybe they don't deserve to win the appeal as they didn't believe enough in their team. Did they not apply because they had done it late or not had the right people in place? Then that's a mistake internally and they have to abide by the rules like everybody else.\" Everton travel to Aston Villa tonight and Moyes admits his own prospects of qualifying for the Europa League are dependent on a victory at Villa Park. The Scot, who will again be without the injured Mikel Arteta, said: \"It puts a lot of significance on this match. If we lose to Villa I don't think it means we are completely dead, but it makes it more unlikely.\" Portsmouth visit Wigan, who have targeted maximum points from their three remaining home games for Premier League survival. Mart\u00ednez said he was \"not at all surprised\" as he watched Grant's side defeat Tottenham in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final but believes a points deduction is merited for any club that slips into administration. \"It is up to Fifa to look closely at this situation and make it harder for this kind of mess to happen. Clubs are institutions that mean a lot to the community but some have begun to feel they can get away with being badly managed and you cannot allow that,\" he said. \"If you are mismanaging a club financially then you are trying to gain an advantage on the football pitch, so a club should be punished with a deduction.\" Mart\u00ednez confirmed he is to appeal against the FA's charge of improper conduct for comments made against the referee Stuart Attwell following Wigan's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on 29 March. The Wigan manager, who accused Attwell of \"lying\" over the reasons for his dismissal of the defender Gary Caldwell with the game goalless, said: \"I feel the comments are not disrespectful in any way, shape or form. The referee had a clear idea of why he sent Gary off but what the referee is saying never happened. From that point of view, I need to clarify things in front of the FA and I will do that. It is important that we understand the meaning of the comments and look at the situation as a whole.\" Portsmouth's administrator, Andrew Andronikou, believes the club could succeed in its bid to play in the Europa League. The first step in making a case to the FA would be to agree a company voluntary arrangement with creditors to exit administration. Andronikou is understood to be finalising an offer to put to creditors. If that is agreed, all football debts have been settled and up-to-date accounts filed, the club will be a position to make a case to the FA before Uefa's 31 May deadline. Andronikou said: \"I believe that we will satisfy all the criteria. We should be in a CVA by the deadline, all debts will have been sorted out and arrangements made with the football creditors. We should tick all the boxes. In terms of sport ethics, I think the club has had its medicine, has been taught its lesson and should be allowed to go forward, and preventing them from playing in the Europa League would be wrong.\" Rob Lloyd, the property tycoon who has been conducting due diligence on the club's books, was believed to be meeting Andronikou last night and is understood to remain optimistic a deal can be done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
