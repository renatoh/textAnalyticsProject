That room closed 10 years ago, but the House of Blues theme returned to Boston in February 2009, creating a premier 2,500-capacity room with a seated balcony. Situated next to Fenway Park, the biggest \"club\" in Boston has hosted everyone from Bob Dylan to Deadmau5. \u2022 15 Lansdowne St, +1 888 693 2583, hob.com/boston Brighton Music Hall Located in the heart of Allston Rock City's populous student village, the club known for 40 years as Harpers Ferry received a much-needed reboot in January 2011 \u2013 and with it came a revitalised live slate of young, touring buzz bands and top-shelf locals. When bigger acts want to play an intimate club show (the capacity is 400), they come here \u2013 whether it's Tegan and Sara or the Dropkick Murphys, who play annually during St Patrick's Day week. \u2022 158 Brighton Ave, +1 617 779 0140, brightonmusichall.com Great Scott A former frat bar equidistant from Boston University and Boston College, Great Scott had a dramatic makeover 10 years ago into an indie rock mecca, placing it among the best small-sized rock clubs in the country.

The band playing tonight could be huge in two years. \u2022 1222 Commonwealth Ave, +1 617 566 9014, greatscottboston.com The Plough &amp; Stars Cambridge has its share of live music venues, but the tiny Plough &amp; Stars is the sort of neighbourhood bar where you can have a pint and watch your friend's band.

It's a live-music venue and restaurant, run by The Bowery and noted chef Michael Schlow, and has an ambitious roster of acts. The \"landing spot\" perch above the front of house is perhaps the best place in town to watch a gig, and the side balconies put you comfortably above the sonic fray.

Located in Mark Sandman Square, named after the late Morphine singer/slide bassist, the Middle East is a musical institution for all genres, and a cultural centre. \u2022 472-480 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, +1 617 864 3278, mideastclub.com Middlesex Lounge Stodgy rock town Boston was one of the last places to embrace electronic dance music, but the Middlesex Lounge has been providing a steady beat since 2004. Live shows have a DIY feel, as indie bands perform on the floor (there's no stage), but the real draw is the wealth of DJ nights, including techno mainstay Make It New. The room's minimalist decor is sleek and cool, and the cocktail menu keeps the hip crowd \u2013 fashionable twentysomethings and brainy students from nearby MIT \u2013 dancing until last call. \u2022 315 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, +1 617 868 6739, middlesexlounge.us The Paradise Rock Club Ever since U2 played here in 1980, the Paradise has been the best live music venue in Boston.
