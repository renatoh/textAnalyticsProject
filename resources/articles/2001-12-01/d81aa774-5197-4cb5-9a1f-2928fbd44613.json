The managers' consensus added a fresh chill to a bitterly cold Valley, which had just witnessed a numbing spectacle. Souness' sentiment was more understandable given that any kind of win, especially after three straight defeats, stimulates fresh hope and because he witnessed something new in that Blackburn for once finished clinically. But it will not prevent Souness continuing negotiations for Savo Milosevic, who will bring an entertaining if erratic dimension to his front line. For Curbishley the festive period is serious business: \"After January 1, the season will have taken shape,\" he said. \"We can either be looking upwards and onwards after the next four games or once again over our shoulder.\" This was a bad start to Operation Holiday. Fear is the key for the bulk of the Premiership and Curbishley believes there will be many more games of this dreary ilk. \"Teams are coming here,\" he said, \"getting behind the ball and countering. It's a bit negative but we have to contend with it. Blackburn simply said to us, 'Break us down - and we couldn't'. It was very similar to Bolton last week, when we asked them to break us down.\" Souness was making no apologies; Blackburn have not looked out of place this season in the Premiership. The same cannot be said of Corrado Grabbi, a picture of Italian homesickness. Perhaps the \u00a36.75m striker will soon be making the opposite journey to Milosevic, who is awaiting his release papers from Parma to return to English football. But for unaccountable misses, and the \"flukes\" of winning goals for Middlesbrough and Newcastle, Souness believes Blackburn would be respected for more than their obvious solidity. Yet he might have been speaking for Curbishley when he said: \"Our aim is to avoid being in the relegation scrap and be in the Premiership next season.\" Glaring misses in the first half by Claus Jensen and Graham Stuart quickly showed that Blackburn are not alone in being wasteful. That was roughly the sum of Charlton's attacking menace until Jason Euell blazed over after a goalmouth scramble eight minutes from time. Brad Friedel had no serious save to make. Blackburn were content to contain until the game witnessed a rare moment of inspiration after 57 minutes. Keith Gillespie's clever ball unhinged Charlton's defence and Duff stretched out to chip across Dean Kiely. In the dying seconds Dunn, left on the bench until midway through the second half, sprinted from his own area to drive home from Gillespie's pull-back. So Charlton flopped in phase one of their festive programme. A crestfallen Curbishley will enjoy much needed cheer, however, if his side display their usual derby prowess at Craven Cottage on Boxing Day. Charlton are unbeaten in their last nine all-London arguments. Perhaps it is Fulham who must now tread fearfully.
