Jody Cundy said he believed Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019s name had been \u201cmuddied\u201d with the revelation that he had obtained therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), in effect a doctor\u2019s note to permit banned substances to be taken for the legitimate treatment of a medical condition, on three occasions. They allowed Wiggins to take the corticosteroid Kenacort, allegedly a performance enhancing substance, before the biggest road races of his career, including his 2012 Tour de France victory. Sutton, who was technical director at British Cycling and remains a consultant for Team Sky, said it was common a few years ago for athletes to use TUEs to \u201cfind gains\u201d if they had a minor injury which permitted them to apply for one. \u201cIf you have an athlete who is 95% ready and that little 5% niggle or injury that is troubling him, if you can get that TUE to get him to 100%, yeah of course you would in them days,\u201d the Australian coach said in a BBC documentary, adding: \u201cYou definitely don\u2019t cross the line and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve never done.\u201d It is not clear if Sutton was referring specifically to Wiggins but Cundy, a seven\u2011times Paralympic champion in swimming and cycling, said he felt those comments would tarnish Wiggins\u2019s reputation. \u201cShane just tells it as it is so that\u2019s exactly what he said and that\u2019s how it will have been perceived,\u201d Cundy said. Asked if he was referring to Wiggins, Cundy said: \u201cI don\u2019t care who it is, if they are fiddling the system they are cheating, I can\u2019t stand cheats. It annoys the hell out of me because you\u2019re doing something to beat somebody without having to put in the same effort. \u201cSo, whether it be GB riders or other nations, to see people who are working the system is disheartening. To know there are people that do that 100% but then have extra things going on in the background, because they\u2019ve got a signed piece of paper saying they can take X, Y and Z and whatever drug. If that\u2019s the attitude people are taking to medical things then it\u2019s a good job he [Sutton] has gone.\u201d One of Britain\u2019s best young riders Katie Archibald, an Olympic champion in the team pursuit, said she did not want to believe Sutton\u2019s suggestion that the TUE system had been exploited. \u201cThat sounds outrageous and it is something that I struggle to believe has been true practice,\u201d she said. \u201cI naively want to hope that there\u2019s been some sort of manipulation or mistranslation. That\u2019s completely against the ethics of the sport.\u201d As British Cycling strives to rescue its reputation after 18 months of allegations of mismanagement, bullying and discrimination, the 23-year-old said it was another blow. \u201cAttaching a term like \u2018marginal gains\u2019 to that sort of practice is also quite distressing,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s almost a trademark British Cycling phrase, isn\u2019t it? Certainly nobody in my squad would attach that practice to the phrase marginal gains.\u201d British Cycling\u2019s chief executive, Julie Harrington, said no elite British Cycling riders currently had TUEs. \u201cI was really disappointed [by Sutton\u2019s comments],\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people are using language around TUEs they need to be very mindful of the effect that could have on the public\u2019s perception and the athletes\u2019 reputation. \u201cThey are issued on medical grounds. Not on performance grounds. As a national governing body our own medics have not supported any applications for our current GB athletes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
