Linda Walker, 48, was dismissed from her \u00a330,000-a-year teaching job in May after a disciplinary hearing before education bosses in Salford, Greater Manchester. She had already spent 36 days of a six-month sentence in prison for affray and possessing a firearm with intent. Her sentence was quashed, but the appeal court judges said the conviction should stand. Today, she took her appeal to governors at her former school, New Park high in Eccles, Salford. But after a seven-hour hearing a panel of three school governors decided to uphold the decision she should be dismissed. The court trial heard Mrs Walker had lost control and used the gun after her family and home had been plagued by local youths reported to have been acting in \"yobbish\" ways for months. She was sacked by the local education authority, which argued that by getting a conviction Mrs Walker had committed gross misconduct and was unfit to be a teacher. The mother-of-two is now left with her 25-year teaching career in tatters, her union said. The general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, Chris Keates, said: \"It is a tragedy that somebody with a hitherto unblemished career who has years of commitment to the education service has been dismissed. \"None of us know how we would react had we faced years of torment and abuse at the hands of a group of youngsters. \"It is regrettable that the governors have placed more emphasis on one lapse caused by extreme provocation than years of service. We will now obviously be consulting legal advisors to see whether any other legal redress is open to her.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
