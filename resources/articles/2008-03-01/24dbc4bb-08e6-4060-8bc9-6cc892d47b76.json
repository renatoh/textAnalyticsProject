The move from Yousef Raza Gilani, voted into office today, was an immediate challenge to Musharraf from the Benazir Bhutto loyalist. Gilani won with 264 votes in the 342-seat lower house of parliament to become prime minister. The pro-Musharraf contender, Chaudhry Pervez Elahi of the Pakistan Muslim League, won 42 votes. His announcement following the vote that he would release the judges triggered cheers and shouts of \"Long Live Bhutto\" from supporters in the visitors' gallery. Bhutto's son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, was also in the gallery and was seen wiping away a tear. Bhutto party supporters also chanted \"Go Musharraf, go\". \"It is because of the martyrdom of Benazir Bhutto that democracy is being restored. It is a historic event,\" Gilani told the assembly. He held out an olive branch to the pro-Musharraf opposition, saying they would be respected, but his order for the release of the judges, though expected, set a tone of confrontation with the president. Minutes after Gilani's order, authorities removed all barricades from outside the house of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and other judges held under house arrest in Islamabad. Supporters were later seen entering Chaudhry's house. Gilani, a vice chairman of Bhutto's party and a former National Assembly speaker, had been expected to win easily with the backing of his PPP and its coalition partners, including the party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif which came second in the Feb. 18 polls. There had been speculation the PPP would nominate a stop-gap prime minister and Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, who now leads the party, would take over the post after entering parliament through a by-election. But party officials rejected such speculation, saying Gilani would be prime minister for a full five-year term. Musharraf is due swear in Gilani tomorrow. He is expected to begin naming ministers to his cabinet this week. If reinstated, the judges are expected to take up legal challenges to the president. Musharraf dismissed the judges in November out of a fear they would rule his own re-election in October by the previous assembly unconstitutional. The United States and other Western allies fear political instability in nuclear-armed Pakistan - already facing a campaign of attacks by al-Qaida inspired militants - if there is confrontation between the president and the new government. Musharraf has been politically isolated since the defeat of his allies in the election and there is speculation that his old foes forming a government will try to force him from power. Gilani, a soft-spoken, resolute person, was jailed in 2001 by the Musharraf government for making illegal appointments, but was freed in 2006. He said the charge was politically motivated. While in prison, Gilani wrote a book that advocated a strong military, but one removed from politics. He has called for the repeal of constitutional changes made by Musharraf to bolster his authority, including the power to dismiss a government. The PPP-led coalition almost has the two-thirds majority in the two-chamber parliament needed to amend the constitution. Gilani also asked the assembly to pass a resolution condemning the \"judicial murder\" of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir's father and Pakistan's first popularly elected prime minister. He was toppled by the military in 1977 and hanged two years later after a controversial court ruling in which he was found him guilty of murder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
