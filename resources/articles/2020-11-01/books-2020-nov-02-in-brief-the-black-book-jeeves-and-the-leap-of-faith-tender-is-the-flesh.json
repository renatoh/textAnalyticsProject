Sybil Oldfield\u2019s thoroughly researched and fascinating historical biography explores the lives of many of the 2,600 citizens who attracted Hitler\u2019s ire, ranging from high-profile entertainers and writers to those naturalised refugees who doggedly resisted the Nazis from afar. Jeeves and the Leap of Faith Ben Schott Hutchinson, \u00a318.99, 334pp Ben Schott\u2019s second Jeeves and Wooster book proves an enjoyable continuation of PG Wodehouse\u2019s classic characters. Schott writes in a distinctive style that is somewhere between homage and postmodern response and his story \u2013 Bertie attempts to save the Drones Club from bankruptcy while continuing his haphazard work as a secret service freelancer \u2013 is more eventful and action-packed than Wodehouse would ever have countenanced. The laughs keep coming, the pivotal character of Iona McAuslan is far better drawn than any woman in the originals and it ends on a splendid cliffhanger. Tender Is the Flesh Agustina Bazterrica Pushkin Press, \u00a38.99, 221pp (paperback) \u201cIf everyone was eating human meat, would you?\u201d asks Agustina Bazterrica\u2019s provocative and chilling novella. Set in a dystopian world where cannibalism has become legal, if disguised by the euphemism \u201cspecial meat\u201d, Bazterrica follows a factory owner, Marcos, whose business revolves around the production and supply of human flesh, even as his once-dormant conscience is awakened by an unexpected arrival in his slaughterhouse. Elegantly translated by Sarah Moses, this is bleak, sometimes sickening stuff, but there is no doubting the conviction with which Bazterrica presents this very contemporary parable.
