Same as old one, but without the mistakes", "bodyText": "The weird thing about the removal of Dalton Philips as chief executive of Morrisons is that no one seems to think that his strategy \u2013 to cut prices, even if that means lower profits \u2013 is the wrong one. Not even Andy Higginson, the former Tesco boss and new Morrisons chairman, who swung the axe. Higginson went out of his way to insist that Philips \u2013 who unveiled his plan last March to pour \u00a31bn into cutting prices over the coming three years \u2013 was on the right road. But although Philips was first with the big cuts, he was too late. Morrisons\u2019 Christmas sales were down 3.1% \u2013 worse than Tesco and Sainsbury. It takes six months to a year for customers who do not normally shop in a store to recognise a change in pricing. And Philips\u2019 Match &amp; More loyalty card, which matches prices at Aldi as well as Morrison\u2019s traditional rivals and was supposed to ram home the new price credentials, is too complicated at a time when shoppers increasingly just want clear, and cheaper, pricing. And Philips made just too many mis-steps before arriving at the correct conclusion. He wasted time and money buying an online childrenswear business and a stake in a New York internet grocer in a bid to learn how to launch a UK online food operation, eventually doing a deal with Ocado. He tried to take Morrisons upmarket, when what shoppers wanted was more basic, cheaper shops, like Aldi. He opened a batch of convenience stores, only to later have to close some, admitting they were in the wrong locations. He boasted that sales would turn positive over Christmas 2013 \u2013 but delivered a shocking 6% downturn. The shares, 300p when he took over and 300p in September 2013, had dropped to 152p a year later. With that history, Morrisons needed not to be the worst performer over Christmas if the boss was to keep his job. On Tuesday, as he was pointed to the checkout, the shares rose 4% to 184p. So now Higginson must find a new chief executive, to pursue pretty much the same strategy but without the mistakes. He does not want, he said, someone with L-plates \u2013 possibly a sideswipe at Tesco\u2019s decision to hire non-retailer Dave Lewis. There are many potential candidates: Jim McCarthy of Poundland, TalkTalk\u2019s Dido Harding, Monsoon\u2019s John Browett, Brakes\u2019 Ken McMeikan \u2013 all former Tesco and/or Sainsbury\u2019s executives. Or maybe Kate Swann, who demonstrated how to run a business on tight margins and with declining sales at WHSmith. Only one thing is certain: it will be a tough gig. Analyst predicts a riot There are bears. There are \u00fcberbears. And then there\u2019s Albert Edwards of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Financial markets always have a resident Dr Doom, the analyst who can always find a reason to be miserable. It was once Tony Dye of UBS; now it\u2019s Edwards, who outlined his thoughts for 2015 to a packed house in London\u2019s West End on Tuesday. The theme was summed up by the title of his presentation: \u201c2015 looks set to be the year deflation overwhelms the west. Markets set to riot.\u201d This, it hardly need be said, is a minority view. The consensus is that while the eurozone is struggling and Japan\u2019s emergence from deflation is proving more protracted than expected, the signs from elsewhere are more promising. The US is seeing solid growth and decent levels of job creation; Beijing seems to be in control of China\u2019s economic slowdown; and plunging oil prices reflect an oversupply of crude rather than a lack of demand. The expectation, therefore, is that the US Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates in mid-2015. Investors are anticipating that stronger growth and higher borrowing costs will lead to a sell off in US Treasury bonds, just as they were a year ago. Edwards takes a different view. He thinks China\u2019s growth is much weaker than the official figures suggest. He is not convinced that the drop in the cost of crude from $115 a barrel to a little over $45 a barrel is simply the result of US shale and Saudi overproduction, pointing out that iron ore prices have collapsed as well. He thinks the US economic cycle is at a relatively advanced stage and says whole-economy non-financial profits have come down with a bump. Japan will use a cheaper yen to flood the world with cheap goods and China will be forced to respond. The hit to US profits will lead to firms cutting investment and, as in the past, this will be the trigger for recession. Shares will suffer and bond prices will rise. Critics of Edwards say he is like a stopped clock, bound to be right sooner or later, and there is something in this. It is always possible to find the data to support a view, whether bullish or bearish, if you are smart enough. The sky has not fallen in, despite the repeated warnings that it is about to do so. Even so, Edwards has a point. The three things that normally get the global economy out of a hole are time, policy easing and falling commodity prices. It is getting on for eight years since the start of the financial crisis, long enough in the past for the healing process to be complete. The policy response by central banks and finance ministries has been unprecedented. Oil prices have fallen by $70 a barrel in six months. If all that doesn\u2019t work, we really are in trouble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
