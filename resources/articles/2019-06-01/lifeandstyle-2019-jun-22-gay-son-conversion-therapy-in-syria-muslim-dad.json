When Riyadh was growing up in Bray, south of Dublin, they were inseparable. Like twins or best friends, they say. So the Iraqi-born, Irish citizen remembers keenly the moment when he realised his eldest child had drifted from him. \u201cWe used to go everywhere together,\u201d 54-year-old Sam recalls. \u201cEvery weekend we\u2019d go to a tropical fish shop and pick out which koi carp to go into our pond. The first time Riyadh didn\u2019t come with me, he was about 15. And the lad who worked there said: \u2018Where\u2019s your mate?\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s grown up now, he\u2019s out with his friends.\u2019 It was a shock to the system.\u201d The bigger shock was yet to come. Riyadh had stopped hanging out with his dad because he realised he was gay \u2013 a revelation he did not think his Muslim father, a garage owner with a passion for football and cars, would take well. He was right: it took him another year, and when Riyadh came out to his dad, Sam says it \u201ccame like a fast train, it hit me very hard. Those couple of words didn\u2019t register. I was going, \u2018Shit, is he? Fuck, fuck!\u2019\u201d The coming-out drama forms part of a new book by Riyadh, an Irish YouTuber and broadcaster, whose bright, conversational guide to being a young gay man \u2013 Yay! You\u2019re Gay! Now What? \u2013 offers salient advice on topics from gender identity to anal sex. There is also a necessary chapter written from the parents\u2019 perspective, by Sam and Riyadh\u2019s mother, Lorraine. We meet in Riyadh\u2019s flat in London. Both men are as candid as the book, particularly with each other. Riyadh, 28, recalls that he was flamboyant as a child. In his book, he writes that, \u201cI was king of the sissy boys, growing up. I loved running around the house in my mother\u2019s pink silk nightgown, black stilettos and anything I could find that sparkled.\u201d At seven, his father told him to start acting like a boy. \u201cI was worried he was too gentle, I needed to toughen him up,\u201d Sam says now. When Riyadh was in his early teens, in addition to hiking or fishing, his dad took him to karate. \u201cI thought, he was going to get the shit beaten out of him, so I wanted him to toughen up. I saw him as soft.\u201d Riyadh read this as a judgment. \u201cWe\u2019d been buddies so closely until that point and then, all of a sudden, I wasn\u2019t enough. I hadn\u2019t got enough masculinity in me to match what you saw as normal or acceptable,\u201d he says, addressing his father directly. \u201cI knew you were doing it because you were worried about my safety in the big, bad world. But it was damaging because I couldn\u2019t live up to the expectation. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Sam had toughed it out himself. Born in southern Iraq, he lived in Baghdad until 1982, when an error on a reissued birth certificate (three years were knocked off his age by mistake) gave him a window of time to escape the country before military service beckoned. \u201cFriends of mine lost arms and legs. Some died,\u201d he says of the Iraq-Iran war of the time. \u201cYou walked down every street, and there was a funeral.\u201d He had always hoped to go to Europe (\u201cI loved the way people could live freely\u201d) and on his second attempt he reached England, where he met Lorraine, a Catholic woman from the east coast of Ireland. They fell in love, married and moved to the seaside town of Bray, where they had their first son, Riyadh, two years later. At 16, he came out to his mother after she found gay porn on the family computer. She kept her son\u2019s secret from his father for nine months. \u201cShe was my shelter and my confidante,\u201d Riyadh says. She was also adept at making his sexuality the new normal. Driving around in the car together, she used to point to a good-looking man and ask: \u201cWould you?\u201d During this time, Riyadh\u2019s relationship with his father soured. \u201cI hated him for what he didn\u2019t already know,\u201d Riyadh says. Lorraine told her son to tell his father over dinner one evening. Riyadh wrote down \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d on a piece of paper and handed it over. Sam was bewildered. \u201cMy head was like a washing machine,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was acting, pretending I was OK. I always try to fix things if something is broken.\u201d Now he couldn\u2019t find a fix. He decided on drastic action. \u201cI got up and sat in the back garden at 3am. My head was absolutely wrecked. I searched the house for tablets.\u201d He pauses, and his son asks him about those suicidal thoughts. \u201cWhy did you not do it?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t find them.\u201d Riyadh was also in a terrible state. He worried that his father \u2013 whom he describes as \u201coutrageously heterosexual\u201d \u2013 would instigate an honour killing or arranged marriage, or force his son into gay conversion therapy. In his book, Riyadh frames this lightly, as his own \u201csuper-dramatic thinking\u201d. But he wasn\u2019t far off the mark: Sam\u2019s response was to put his faith and honour first. \u201cI thought of family,\u201d Sam says, \u201cwhich is really stupid, because I left Iraq so long ago.\u201d He breaks down at this, upset by the conflict his son\u2019s confession exposed. Riyadh explains that his father spoke to a family member, and that it did not go well. \u201cThey asked, \u2018How come your son is like this? You should change him,\u2019\u201d continues Sam, still in tears. \u201cThey said we could help Riyadh: bring him to Syria and treat him there with conversion therapy.\u201d Then Riyadh\u2019s mother stepped in. \u201cLorraine said, \u2018Wake up,\u2019\u201d Sam recalls. \u201c\u2018I know you love your son, so show your love.\u2019\u201d She asked a neighbour who had two gay sons to talk to Sam. \u201cA lovely man,\u201d he says. \u201cAn absolute gentleman. He said, \u2018Look, son, the family is you. Forget about what they [the wider family] think.\u201d He decided to rebuild the relationship with his son. Riyadh and his younger brother had been raised in a multi-faith household: they were brought up Catholic, like their mother, but also attended mosque with their father at weekends. Now the family began to reassess their relationship with faith. They made a collective decision to stop practising religion altogether and redefine themselves as humanists. Riyadh stresses that he does not believe it\u2019s impossible to reconcile sexuality with faith. For his family, it was a simple decision. \u201cWe as a family found it quite easy to step away from all religion because we were never very faith-led in the first place. We were, by default, following what we\u2019d been told to follow from a young age. My coming out was a catalyst for us to stand back and look at those beliefs and ask, \u2018Do they represent us as a family, or not?\u2019\u201d Riyadh asks his father if this was difficult for him. \u201cNo. No. As long as I\u2019m a nice person,\u201d Sam says. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m not going to hurt people or do bad things, I am just happy with that.\u201d Sam then cut ties with his wider family. \u201cThere is no relationship now. Because of Riyadh I have lost family members, but it is fine with me, honestly,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce my two boys, my wife and I are happy in our home, I don\u2019t care what is going to happen out on the street.\u201d Since Riyadh came out, Sam has been to gay clubs and on Pride marches and made new LGBTQ friends. But perhaps the most dramatic shift is in their relationship with each other: they are remarkably close, comfortable sharing anything. There was no hesitation on Sam\u2019s part when Riyadh asked him to help with the book. Riyadh\u2019s involvement in the marriage equality campaign in Ireland had been crucial: \u201cI could see my son going on the TV and radio, trying to help the Yes vote. You realise that he is actually saving lives and doing good. Now who wouldn\u2019t like something like this?\u201d Getting involved with his son\u2019s activism \u2013 appearing together in YouTube videos, on Irish television, in the book \u2013 was a no-brainer. \u201cThis book \u2013 even if it saves one life, it would be worth a great deal,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to help stop one parent or one father like me from considering suicide, it\u2019s worth doing.\u201d The first LGBTQ event the Khalafs attended as a family was a Dublin rally for marriage equality in Ireland. \u201cWe were standing side by side. Dad was getting emotional, watching the speeches,\u201d Riyadh remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. He was cheering and shouting for the LGBTQ cause. It was like a personal revolution. It was like, \u2018I won\u2019t hate, I will love.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou took the words out of my mouth,\u201d says Sam. He turns to Riyadh and, with tenderness, says: \u201cIt\u2019s because I love you, son, that\u2019s why.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. \u2022 Yay!
