So we read loads of gorgeous books to the children and get them to talk about them, and while we're doing this we teach them how to read sounds. We use synthetic phonics, which is based on a system where we teach children the sounds (phonemes), initially \"m\", \"a\", \"s\", \"d\" and \"t\". We don't use letter names and we've created a frog called Fred for the children who can speak in sounds but can't say a whole word, so the children have got to help him to put the sounds together to make words. Children have to recognise that we speak in 44 sounds but only have 26 letters to represent them. A good synthetic phonic programme recognises this, so you don't give the children the idea that a letter represents just one sound because you get combinations of letters that represent sounds as well, such as \"wh\" and \"ch\". The children then read the sounds in words and then read those words in books. I haven't failed on a child yet. You've got to enthuse children that reading is the best thing ever. Synthetic phonics must not be dry; it's the quickest route to getting them to read the best books ever. The professor: Henrietta Dombey Our writing system is not amenable to a totally synthetic phonic approach. Also, children don't perceive language the same way as adults do, as a sequence of separable sounds, so we're working with a writing system that is not consistently represented phoneme by phoneme. Certainly children do need to recognise the letters of the alphabet and the speech sounds those letters may represent, but they also need to learn to recognise certain words on sight such as \"one\", \"two\", \"eye\" and \"new\" that are not amenable to phonic analysis. Rhyme patterns are also very useful; they're not totally reliable but they're much more reliable than individual phonemes. There are huge wars played about phonics, when actually the problem among our kids now is that they don't like reading because they get taught by teachers in the grip of the national literacy strategy. Teachers are told what to do far too much, which means they stop watching the children and stop taking account of enthusing them. Synthetic phonics is focused on technique and snippets of books, and it's a kind of painting by numbers approach to literacy teaching, rather than something more dynamic that recognises kids have a sense of purpose and need to experience texts for themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
