Barack Obama has struck what his incomparable mentor Abraham Lincoln once called \"the mystic chords\" of the American communal memory and opened a grand symphony in response. At the beginning of 2007, I wrote an article in the Guardian about the wretched state of America, once almost universally esteemed, by then generally reviled around the world. It would take a new kind of president, I wrote, to restore its reputation and its self-esteem, a president perhaps displaying the quality of being at once blessed and blessing, to which the Arabs have attached the word \"Baraka\". I had never heard of Barack Obama then, but perhaps some mystic chord was already being tuned up for performance. Of course the benevolent idea of Obama is inextricably linked with the blessed idea of America \u2013 not only the pursuit of happiness and the equality of all peoples, but a fundamental belief in goodness. Goodness, we have to admit, is a strong element of the evangelical conviction that took George Bush to the presidency and sustained him through so many humiliations, just as it is an essential component of the Islamic faith he opposed. But it is an entirely un-dogmatic, un-sectarian view of divinity, I feel sure, that Lincoln had in mind when he referred to God in the most moving of all American declarations of intent, the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln spoke then of a new birth \"under God\", and I don't think it fanciful to suggest that with luck and celestial guidance, Obama might be offering not just to America, but to the world at large, some new beginning. He is such a general representative of mankind, in his origins as in his attitudes, and I can think of no world leader in all history so qualified to stand above all the varied squalors of bigotry or prejudice. Religion of course, will always be vote-catching and rabble-rousing, appealing at once to the best and the worst in human behaviour. Modern British politicians have missed the power of its appeal to an electorate generally devoid of any religious allegiance at all. Very many Americans, though, like nearly all Muslims, will rally to a moral summons, and what we all seem to feel in Obama is a sense of kindness, which lies at the root of most great religions, and is understandable to everyone. His appeal to nearly all kinds of people is only partly the happy consequence of his origins, only partly the historical circumstance of his election, only peripherally his obvious talents, but very largely, I think, because he gives us the impression of being a good, kind man. And I think he has one other powerful qualification too, for his tremendous destiny. Like most of the greatest American presidents of the past, he has to him some of the transcendental allure of the poet. From Lincoln himself to FDR, the most memorable tenants of the White House have been men of lyric instinct. When a man is poetic as well as kind, possessed at once of mystic appeal and intellectual magnetism, when he has become, in short, an idea, then we may reasonably hope for greatness. But God knows (if there is one), we may all be wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
