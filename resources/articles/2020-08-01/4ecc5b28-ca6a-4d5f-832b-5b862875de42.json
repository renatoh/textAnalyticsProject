The striker\u2019s two goals against Chelsea can only have enhanced the number of rivals casting covetous eyes in his direction, but Arteta wants to remodel his side around Aubemeyang and is determined to keep a player with one year remaining on his current deal. \u201cHe knows what I think about him, I want to build a squad around him,\u201d said Arsenal\u2019s manager. \u201cI want him to stay, it\u2019s about getting the deal done.\u201d Despite negotiations proving inconclusive, Arteta remains confident Arsenal have shown their star striker sufficient love to ensure he sticks around. \u201cI think moments like this will help him to believe we are on the right path and he is a big part of it. He is loved by everyone at the club. I think he will [stay].\u201d Aubameyang, though, was giving little away. When asked if he would be signing a new contract, the forward said there was \u201cnothing\u201d he could reveal. \u201cJust the trophy, that is it,\u201d he said before, to the amusement of his teammates, proceeding to drop the Cup. \u201cHe needs more experience with trophies,\u201d joked Arteta who praised his players\u2019 resilience in fighting back after falling behind. \u201cI knew the challenge when I took the decision to come here. We had to change the mentality. But now this team have made me proud and after we can win titles together.\u201d Arteta replied \u201cI think so\u201d to an inquiry about whether this was the greatest moment of his career. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to represent these players and this club. \u201cIt was a difficult start when we conceded so early, but if I know something about these players it\u2019s that we weren\u2019t going to give up. They reacted straight away. We played probably the best 30 minutes after since I arrived and from the equaliser, we went on and generated belief.\u201d \u201cThey have worked hard. It\u2019s a double reward for us, it is really important in every way for this club to be in Europe.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager made a point of thanking his mentor. \u201cI have to say a very big thank you to Pep, his teachings are a big reason I\u2019m a manager,\u201d he said. While Arteta was wreathed in smiles, Frank Lampard opened the post-match media debrief with a face like thunder before gradually recovering a little of his more customary good humour. \u201cIt [Mateo Kovacic\u2019s second yellow card] wasn\u2019t a sending off but we didn\u2019t play well enough to win a final,\u201d said Chelsea\u2019s manager, as he refused to use his team\u2019s injuries and reduction to 10 men as excuses. \u201cWe had control of the game but then we got sloppy. We were slow, we invited pressure. But Willian got injured in the last 24 hours and had to pull out. And then to have two hamstring injuries [C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Christian Pulisic] and a dislocated shoulder [Pedro] felt like it came a bit to the tipping point today. \u201cWe are at the end of a long, long season. We shouldn\u2019t become too stuck on today. It would have been nice, the icing on the cake but it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
