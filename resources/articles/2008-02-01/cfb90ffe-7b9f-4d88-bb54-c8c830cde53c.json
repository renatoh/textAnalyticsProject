That tells you all you need to know about a match that until the closing stages was a sure-fire contender for the worst Premier League game of the season. This was awful stuff from two clubs with a walloping 35 league defeats between them so far this campaign. Not that the home supporters necessarily cared. Three points against Derby was always a must in Wigan's battle to avoid relegation. They achieved that thanks to second-half goals from Paul Scharner and Antonio Valencia. Job done, ugly style, on an even uglier pitch. 'It needs a bomb on the bastard,' said the Wigan manager, Steve Bruce, of the Lancashire cabbage patch currently masquerading as a top-flight football surface. As for Derby, this reverse plumbed new depths. Paul Jewell, the man who last season guided Wigan to safety with a final-day win at Sheffield United, described their showing as 'the worst performance I've ever, ever seen from a so-called Premier League team. We lost 4-1 at home to Preston [in the FA Cup] and for 30 minutes against Sheffield Wednesday [in an FA Cup replay] we were awful, but that's as bad as it's been.' All that remains now for the Rams is to try to pick up the seven points they require to avoid becoming the worst side in Premier League history, a dubious honour currently held by the Sunderland team of 2005-06. On this evidence, they will struggle to collect another one. 'That was just dire, there's no getting away from it,' added Jewell. 'From the first whistle to the last whistle we were second-best in all departments. This team isn't good enough. It's a million miles short of being a proper Premier League team. 'In a lot of the games we've been competitive without ever looking like winning, but to play like we did today was embarrassing, not because I've come back to Wigan but because Derby County deserves better than that. It's a great football club. A lot of the players here, not all of them, aren't deserving to be here.' The two moments that enlightened an otherwise forgettable afternoon were Wigan's goals. The first arrived on the hour, the Derby goalkeeper Roy Carroll parrying an Emile Heskey shot into the path of Scharner who scored from close range. Wigan wrapped it up six minutes from time when Valencia collected a cross-field pass from Wilson Palacios, turned inside his marker and blasted a shot high past the visiting keeper. Derby's one effort worth mentioning came when substitute Emanuel Villa's overhead kick was comfortably claimed by Chris Kirkland in the Wigan goal. For the Rams, the end of the season cannot come soon enough. 'To be fair I think the only team that was going to win it was us,' Bruce said. 'It was just a matter of taking one of the chances. It's difficult as you've seen again with the pitch, but they're trying as best as they can on it. You've got to give them a pat on the back for their effort and endeavour.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
