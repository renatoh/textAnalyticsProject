By the end of August, the Ahyeon overpass will have been replaced by another, greener bus-only lane. Seoul has decided to remove the structure, a symbol of South Korea's high-speed development. Originally built in 1968, the 1km-long highway was located close to Hongik, a vibrant student neighbourhood in the city centre. In those days, the city council was led by Kim Hyun-ok. Aged only 39 when he got the job, he soon came to be known as Bulldozer Kim. He was often seen on building sites, sporting a helmet marked \"Charge\". A close ally of the dictator Park Chung-hee (father of the current president, Park Geun-hye), he initiated a major public works programme that radically changed the skyline. Elevated expressways were a key feature of Kim's projects, and the first to be built was the Ahyeon overpass. It was intended as part of a never completed link road running from east to west across the capital. To cope with the massive increase in population and traffic during the 1980s, 101 expressways were built. They were quick to put up and much cheaper than extending the underground. This policy reflected \"the speed-oriented, top-down urban planning methods of the old days,\" says Kim Ki-ho at Seoul University. \"Elevated expressways were a necessary evil to keep traffic moving,\" the conservative daily Dong-A noted on 6 February. \"But the fewer there are, the better.\" Apart from spoiling the view, one of the main problems of the various new structures was how quickly they wore out, becoming a serious hazard. In 1995, Seoul residents were horrified when the Sampoong department store collapsed, claiming 502 lives. A year earlier, 32 people were killed when part of the Seongsu bridge over the river Han subsided. The city was spending about $7.5m a year on upkeep and repairs for the Ahyeon overpass. Given the small drop in the city's population since the turn of the century \u2013 falling just below 10 million \u2013 the Seoul authorities are advocating policies to improve the environment, in the hope of enhancing its image abroad and attracting more tourists. About 15 expressways have been demolished since 2002. The city council plans to remove one near the main railway station and another at Seodaemun, also in the city centre. The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, wants to develop cycle lanes and supports the return of trams, discarded by Bulldozer Kim as being too slow. After the success of the Cheonggyecheon expressway's demolition in 2003, subsequent projects caused little concern. The artificial river laid out in its place in 2003-05 \u2013 at a cost of $359m \u2013 created a 9km green swath through the city centre, which is much appreciated by pedestrians. The price is high because every day 120,000 tonnes of water has to be pumped into the river Han to feed the channel. But it has transformed nearby streets and even brought a 3.6C drop in average summer temperatures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
