Dismissing Conservative calls for a referendum on the treaty, Mr Brown insists the pact entails no substantive transfers of powers from London to Brussels because he has secured a series of exemptions from the treaty that he describes as Britain's \"red lines\". These red lines are supposed to shore up Britain's sovereignty over foreign policy-making, over its labour, employment, and social legislation and rights, preserve the idiosyncracies of Britain's common law system, and prevent unwanted intrusion in the social security system. Critics and eurosceptics argue the red lines are crumbling. Mr Brown says he will not back the new treaty unless they are secure. The treaty enshrines the EU's 2004 charter of fundamental rights, which is enforced by the European court of justice. But an extra protocol obtained by Britain states no new rights under the charter can be imposed here by the European court. This \"opt-out\" is likely to be challenged in the courts. The treaty changes the basis for decision-taking and legislation in the areas of police, criminal justice, and judicial affairs. Until now, these areas were subject to unanimity, meaning Britain could veto measures. Decisions are now to be taken by qualified majority voting, meaning that Britain can be outvoted. Britain has reserved the right to \"opt in\" to such measures on an ad-hoc basis. The treaty also creates a new foreign policy supremo and a European diplomatic service. But European foreign policy remains subject to member governments agreeing, meaning there is little danger of Britain being overruled. The foreign policy red line looks secure, the others less so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
