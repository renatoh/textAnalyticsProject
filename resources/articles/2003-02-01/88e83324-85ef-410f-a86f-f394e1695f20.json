The under-19 team, last year, made 109 for eight against a Northamptonshire under-19 team and 114 all out against Denmark's under-19 team. The under-21 team were dismissed for 53 by an ECB under-21 team in Dublin. And on Wednesday the full-strength team collapsed to 54 for seven. Daan van Bunge (highest previous score: three) went on to make a doughty 62 but it was not enough for Holland to overtake India's humble total of 204 and complete the first serious shock of this World Cup. 'Batting is our problem,' says captain Roland Lefebvre, relaxing in the lounge bar of the Rotterdam Hockey Club after his final training session before he left for South Africa. Lefebvre, an engaging man who played spiritedly for both Somerset and Glamorgan, celebrated his fortieth birthday a week-and-a-half ago with a ' spit-brei ' at his in-laws' place in Cape Town. When he broke into the Dutch team a couple of decades ago it was primarily as a batsman; now, despite his advanced years, he opens the bowling. It's the batting which lets them down. 'We mustn't kid ourselves,' says Lefebvre. 'We are not used to Brett Lee's pace or the consistency of a McGrath. We shouldn't set our aims too high. Our aim should be to bat for 50 overs.' On Wednesday they were within 11 balls of their more limited target. It was a spirited performance, however, and perhaps not too much of a surprise. Holland made a fast start at the last World Cup in which they competed in 1996. 'As the tournament progressed we went down slowly,' says Lefebvre. 'Being away from home for five or six weeks is mentally very tiring. But we started fantastically. Against New Zealand and against England we played brilliantly. They scored 270 and we got to 230 and had them on the rack a little bit.' Today they face an England side that has spent the last week crying behind closed doors in hotel rooms. Not the best preparation for avoiding an upset. While everyone else complains about too much cricket, the Dutch need more. After the 1996 World Cup their next one-day interna tional was six years later in Sri Lanka last autumn. 'We can't develop by ourselves,' says Lefebvre. 'We have to tour and get countries to visit. When the programme was less intense we had more county and international sides coming over to Amsterdam because it was a nice break for the side. In 1989 we beat England A and Roeby [Peter Roebuck] was the captain. He had a chat with Somerset. Luckily, old Jack Birkenshaw had heard of me.' And as a result Lefebvre was one of the few Dutchmen to play county cricket. Not only is there a lack of opposition (Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, waiting on Italy) there are limited opportunities to watch putative opponents. 'When I was growing up in 1970s and 1980s,' says Lefebvre, 'and the cricket was on the BBC we watched a lot of Test cricket. In 1976 I remember the West Indies coming over and we went on our bicycles to town, to a tall building in Rotterdam and we put our little deckchairs up in the foyer and watched Viv Richards smash everyone all over the place.' Neither Channel 4 nor Sky travel across the North Sea, which makes it next to impossible to watch any cricket in Holland, where cricket is not big. 'In terms of numbers who play it [6,000] cricket comes number 33 in Holland,' says the president of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond, Ren\u00e9 W van Ierschot. 'Way behind football, tennis, hockey, golf, basketball, handball...' He could go on. The Dutch are sending two journalists and no television companies to cover the World Cup, the qualification for which barely registered a mention on the back pages. While I am in Rotterdam, however, cricket, for the first time, is front-page news. Thanks to Clare Short. 'Now we have questions in Parliament here,' says the president. 'I'm well informed of the humanitarian situation but it is nothing to do with sport. And whether sport can have any effect is very doubtful. I do not believe we will be able to improve the situation as some of the contestants for Miss World in Nigeria believed. It is a very difficult situation. If we do it [a boycott] once then it would imply we were at least condoning a regime whenever we played there. What about Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka... are we going to say no?' The Dutch team's manager, Hans L Mulder, was a member of the ICC's initial security committee. 'The impression I gained from the beginning to the end of my five days,' he says, 'was that it was like any African city. I didn't feel more insecure than I have done in Johannesburg or Nairobi and, in some ways, I would prefer to be in Harare than Johannesburg.' The Dutch have boycotted sporting events before. The entire team refused to attend the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Johan Cruyff made a solo boycott of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. No such protests are expected this time. The Zimbabwe game will be Lefebvre's second last for his country, the winnable match against Namibia his final bow. 'Ageing is a battle you can't win. You feel it. You have to work harder, the mind might be fresh but your body is not that fresh any more. At some stage in your career you get tired. I'll miss it but I think I'm ready for it. The World Cup will be a fantastic way to say goodbye to serious competitive cricket. Maybe my mid-life crisis will start straight after the game with Namibia.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
