ITV will take over from Channel 4, having won a four-year exclusive contract, and details of its presenting team have been leaking out in recent weeks but the station has now opted to clarify some of the remaining details in a press release. Dettori, now 45 and beginning to consider a life after the saddle, has won some praise for contributions on Channel 4 over the past two years. ITV say he will be \u201ca regular contributor \u2026 working around his riding commitments\u201d. Pendleton, meanwhile, \u201cwill bring her perspective\u201d to the coverage. An Olympic champion cyclist, she pulled off one of the more remarkable sporting feats of recent years when finishing fifth in a steeplechase at the Cheltenham Festival, barely a year after sitting on a horse for the first time. But there is no mention of Sir Anthony McCoy, an insightful contributor on Channel 4 since ending a career of unprecedented success as a jump jockey in 2015. McCoy indicated in August that he did not expect to be part of ITV\u2019s final team. \u201cThey seem to have announced their presenters and I wish them the best of luck and hope they do well,\u201d he told The Guardian at that time. Oli Bell is to present ITV\u2019s version of the Morning Line, a Saturday preview show, while Richard Hoiles and Mark Johnson have now been confirmed as its commentators. In addition to other names already known, Brough Scott is to be a regular guest on ITV Racing, while the channel\u2019s weather forecaster Lucy Verasamy will provide reports with a specific focus on future racing events. Niall Sloane, ITV\u2019s director of sport, said: \u201cWe believe this line-up, which draws on a range of people from within racing and beyond, will enrich our coverage with the quality, expertise, insight and personality to bring home to viewers the full enjoyment and appreciation of this wonderful sport.\u201d My Tent Or Yours, who was second in the Champion Hurdle in March after an absence of almost two years, missed his planned return to action at Kempton on Sundaybecause the ground was judged to lack sufficient give. His trainer, Nicky Henderson, won the race anyway with Hargam, who also carries the colours of JP McManus. \u201cLast year, we were plagued with sore shins so he never got to run until the Champion Hurdle,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at his age and had his sort of setbacks, we can\u2019t afford another one. \u201cI got cold feet at the end of the day. It\u2019s a long time until March and at his age we can\u2019t get it wrong again. That would be the end of his career. It would be all over. \u201cI think we have to look at Haydock or the Fighting Fifth [in November], maybe come back here for the Christmas Hurdle.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
