Even the imponderables are now being pondered as the Scot yesterday revealed the superstitions of his coach that dictate the court on which he practises at the All England Club. The world No3, who faces the No19 seed, Stanislas Wawrinka, in the fourth round today, exuded such confidence during the first week that it is hard to imagine his coach, Miles Maclagan, seeing the need for lucky charms or favoured routines. But Murray said the man he hired in 2007 to replace Brad Gilbert was \"a bit weird\". \"My coach is very superstitious so I just go along with his stuff,\" Murray told channelbee.com. \"He always wants me to practise on a specific court, Court Three, before my first match. If I am playing at 2pm, then he will make me practise in the same place I practised the day before. He's a bit weird like that.\" Having beaten Robert Kendrick, Ernests Gulbis and Viktor Troicki in the opening week, the 22-year-old will be third on Centre Court today to face the Swiss Wawrinka, a man he has beaten four times in seven matches but has never played on grass. Gulbis accused Murray of feigning injury at Queen's last year to upset the Latvian's rhythm. Murray denied the accusation, equating such behaviour to cheating, but yesterday he admitted that mind games enhance the sport. \"There is quite a lot of psychology in tennis but you will rarely see it,\" he said. \"John McEnroe has said that he used psychology as a sort of tactic. I wish there was more of it going on, as it makes it more interesting to watch. \"For example, Rafael Nadal always likes to cross the net second. So he waits,\" said Murray of the reigning Wimbledon champion, whose inability to defend his title due to injury has increased the No3 seed's chances of winning a first major. The Spaniard's absence, however, robs Murray of one of his favourite practice partners. \"I get on well with Nadal and warm up with him a lot. When we practise together we get good courts and don't have to share with other players because he's the world No1 and I'm the No3,\" said Murray. \"If I practise with someone else, there can be up to four people to a court, which means you can't really practise and warm up properly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
