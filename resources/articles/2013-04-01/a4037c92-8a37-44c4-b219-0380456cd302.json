The National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) is setting out new policies that include voting against the director who chairs a board nominations committee if companies do not have gender targets for their boards. The body, which could become one the UK's biggest fund managers and control \u00a3150bn of assets by 2030, will also consider voting against the chair of the remuneration committee if there are too many bonus schemes for directors, making it difficult to calculate how bosses are being paid. Nest currently votes at annual meetings through UBS, the Swiss bank, because it does not yet have a large enough presence to exercise its shares in its own right. But a new corporate governance policy is being published with the intention of setting out how it intends to vote in the coming years when it is expected to be large enough to exert influence. Nest aims to attract as many as 5 million of the 11 million workers who are being automatically enrolled into pension schemes under the 2008 Pensions Act, and reckons it will become among the largest fund managers in the UK. \"We are launching our voting policy because we think it's really important our members know what we stand for and that companies know what we stand for,\" said Mark Fawcett, chief investment officer of Nest. Representatives from Nest will begin to attend their first annual general meetings this year. Fawcett said he was concerned about the \"cult of leadership\" at companies, similar to Premier League football clubs seeking out top managers who are then hired and fired quickly. \"If you go in as chief exec expecting to be fired in three years you are going to be demanding a big packet to start with,\" said Fawcett. \"But not every company is going to have \u2026 a star. [But] that has resulted in pay being bid up.\" Nest will be supporting the living wage campaign \u2013 in London set at \u00a38.55 an hour and \u00a37.45 outside the capital. In its voting guidance Nest said: \"We're more supportive of the remuneration committee where there's oversight of the remuneration policy of the entire firm and that this used in the approach to the pay. We're more supportive of the remuneration committee where it considers the relativity of pay internally and not just externally.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
