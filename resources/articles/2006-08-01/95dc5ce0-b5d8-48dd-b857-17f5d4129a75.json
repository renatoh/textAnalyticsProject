As their Premiership challenge faltered at the first step, two of their loan players scored the goals that took Birmingham to the top of the second table, displacing Palace whose 100% record they ended. Birmingham have had a makeover since relegation and needed it - 14 out, nine in, three on loan, all from Arsenal. They are rejuvenated. Their manager, Steve Bruce, said: \"That's as good as we've played in two years.\" It was not difficult to believe. Five years ago, before he could join Birmingham after walking out on Palace, he was dispatched on gardening leave. There was little to do but sweep leaves and last season St Andrew's was a wilderness. Now there is order and colour. Bruno N'Gotty and Radhi Jaidi, ancient transplants from Bolton, should provide a screen until Matthew Upson's return from a ruptured achilles tendon. And there is an attack whose sum is not less than a row of beans. David Dunn was a vibrant force from right midfield, roving in the manner of England's new Steven Gerrard. The Tunisian Mehdi Nafti, Birmingham's first World Cup player, was always collecting and distributing. And Gary McSheffrey, a \u00a34m buy from Coventry, made a crowd- pleasing debut on the left, tricky and committed. In front DJ Campbell was a livewire while Nicklas Bendtner showed the benefit of time at Highbury. Last week, at 18, Bendtner scored on his debut for Denmark, against Poland. Here he equalised after Jobi McAnuff's early shot had found the net by wicked deflection. Nafti picked out the Dane, whose poise in receipt made the goal a formality. Lesser players may be flattered by Palace's cumbrous central defence, which may justify Peter Taylor's preference for 4-5-1. But, where Bendtner floated, the lone striker, James Scowcroft, lumbered in need of support. Mark Kennedy, at \u00a31.5m the costliest teenager when he went from Millwall to Liverpool 11 years ago, was Palace's most creative player. City left it late to take their points tally to double figures but not as late as last season. Then it was December 10. Now, in injury-time, Dunn burst to the byline on to Mikael Forssell's pass and his pull-back set up Sebastian Larsson for the winner. Last season City did so little thinking outside the box there was little action in it. On Saturday there was brightness all over and Gabor Kiraly made four scintillating saves. Historically he was also their smartest man. Palace's away strip is a pattern of milk spilled on lava grey. There was one cloud. When Damien Johnson, the captain, was substituted by Forssell, he left in a tantrum, seemingly upset by the crowd's cheers. Six minutes earlier Bruce was booed for replacing Bendtner with a midfielder, Neil Danns. The cheers for Forssell were directed ironically at Bruce for restoring the balance. \"Damien is disappointed at his actions,\" he said. \"He's been a terrific servant of this club. We'll sort it out when tempers have cooled on Monday. It took the gloss off a bit\" - hardly the reputation of Johnsons. Strictly City are equal top with Cardiff, edging them alphabetically. They should still prove there is more than a letter between them at Ninian Park on Saturday. And, in case Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has forgotten, Larsson can play left-back.
