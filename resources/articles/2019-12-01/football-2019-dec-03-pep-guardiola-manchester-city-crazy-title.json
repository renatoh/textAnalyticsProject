The champions won 4\u20111 and were back to their most impressive as two Gabriel Jesus goals and one apiece from Rodrigo and Riyad Mahrez were answered only by Robbie Brady. If Liverpool beat Everton on Wednesday their lead over City will again be 11 points. Guardiola joked initially when asked about City\u2019s chances of again being champions. \u201cThe title is over,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody gives us a chance. Like everyone says, we are out, we have no chance. We are thinking [only about] ourselves and the next game. \u201cOur team is stable and that\u2019s what we want. For the distance we are behind Liverpool it would be crazy to think about the title, we have to think about the derby [on Saturday], the other competitions we have, and take this rhythm forward. To think how many ways [we can get] close to them is a stupid way to think. We are thinking about ourselves and the next game \u2013 [take it] game by game.\u201d Guardiola also praised Rodri after the midfielder caught the eye. \u201cHe was incredible for his physicality, and [also for] the way he trains, how he wants to learn. It\u2019s nice to talk tactics with him. He gives his opinions about the way he plays,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect for this league, and I think Man City bought an incredible player for the next years.\u201d The win begins a packed December as City play seven more times. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy month but we are going to try,\u201d Guardiola said and who was informed Liverpool have nine matches to play. \u201cLast year we played 10 games, more than Liverpool, so they are in debit. It is what it is.\u201d Next for City is the 179th Manchester derby with United, at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cWe need our fans for Saturday, we have four days [until then]. Tomorrow we watch United\u2019s game against Tottenham and see the way we can do it. To play these games is the reason why we are here,\u201d the manager said. Sean Dyche was disappointed at his muted Burnley side. \u201cFirst half we tried to keep it tight,\u201d he said. \u201cThey scored a worldy [Jesus\u2019s first] and in the second half we didn\u2019t turn up at all. We didn\u2019t lay a glove on them physically.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
