Wantanee Tippaveth, 28, known as Mae Manee, is accused of fraud and other financial crimes after allegedly setting up a Ponzi scheme offering 93% profit to a total of 2,977 investors. Her boyfriend Metee Chinpa, 20, has also been charged with financial misdemeanours. On Friday police raided a fake \u201cgold shop\u201d she had allegedly set up in the city of Udon Thani, north Thailand, to convince potential investors that she lived a super-wealthy lifestyle. Many of those convinced to join Tippaveth\u2019s scheme would reportedly start by paying 1,000 baht which they were told would be invested in cosmetics and film businesses. Some individuals were convinced to invest millions of baht each. Alleged victims have said that other victims had been driven to suicide after losing fortunes to Tippaveth. On Thursday posts on the Thailand Most Wanted Facebook page showed Tippaveth\u2019s shop to be little more than a counter set up at the side of an office-style room. Tippaveth had posted photos of her flaunting what looked like gold jewellery in the allegedly fake shop. Police said that posts such as those, along with photos of her schmoozing with celebrities in luxury locations, helped lure in scam victims. On Saturday her Facebook profile photo showed her leaning against the bonnet of a BMW. On Wednesday Piyasiri Watanawarangkun, financial crime director at Thailand\u2019s department of special investigation (DSI), said: \u201cIf she\u2019s escaping, she should bring her whole house with her. This case has a statute of limitations of 20 years. If anyone is moving her money around or withdrawing money, it will show up as evidence for us.\u201d Thai authorities have frozen Tippaveth\u2019s assets as police search for her, but she has taunted her pursuers on social media. On Thursday she posted: \u201cYou thought would you bring me down and take everything? Do it, I can always find more money.\u201d On Tuesday she posted: \u201cJail is for people who aren\u2019t fighters, and I\u2019m a fighter\u2026 I never abandoned everyone, and I\u2019m not how the news says I am. I\u2019m the victim of slander, attacks, and silencing threats here.\u201d Publicity around Tippaveth\u2019s alleged scheme has led to victims of a similar alleged scam to demand action from Thai authorities. Investors who had lost money in an alleged Ponzi scheme called Forex 3D protested outside the DSI\u2019s headquarters in Bangkok on Friday. Ronnarong Kaewpetch, a lawyer, told Khaosod English that up to 30,000 people had fallen victim to Forex 3D."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
