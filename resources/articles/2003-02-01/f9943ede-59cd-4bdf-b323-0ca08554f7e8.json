Hardly the ideal preparation for St Helens to launch their defence of the Super League title, especially as their first match, on Friday, is against a Bradford team set on revenge. The Bulls remain convinced that they were robbed in last year's Grand Final by the combination in stoppage time of a Sean Long drop goal and Chris Joynt's unpunished voluntary tackle. A group of Bradford supporters cheered the Roosters in 'Saints are cheats' shirts on Friday, although disappointingly they were joined by a number of other high-profile figures in the British game rooting for, and in some cases actively helping, the visitors. That was a measure of the way the Saints, and in particular their sparky Australian coach, Ian Millward, have put so many noses out of joint in the past three years, winning four trophies with exhilarating style on the field but not much humility off it. Another defeat by Bradford on Friday and Millward will be under as much pressure as at any time in his tenure at Knowsley Road. Saints have signed two solid new Aussies in Jason Hooper and Darren Smith, but they will miss Peter Shiels, who has gone home to Newcastle, and for the first third of the season Keiron Cunningham, who has targeted the Challenge Cup final at the Millennium Stadium for his return from a dislocated elbow. As ever, it does not take a rocket scientist to identify the clubs who pose the greatest threat to the champions. The Grand Final at Old Trafford may be nine months away, but the chances are that two of Bradford, Wigan and St Helens will get there - no other club have made it since Leeds lost to Wigan in the inaugural Grand Final in 1998 - with Leeds, Hull and, as real wild cards, Widnes the only other teams even in with a sniff. Bradford will comfortably retain their position as the heaviest squad, with youngsters Richard Moore and Rob Parker battling to take over from Brian McDermott in their 'awesome foursome' of props and Shontayne Hape arriving from New Zealand Warriors to add yet more size to the backs. The feeling of unfinished business from last year's Grand Final, plus the return to Odsal after two years at Valley Parade, should be enough to drive the Bulls back to the top of the table and then on to Old Trafford, where James Lowes, the veteran hooker who has deferred his retirement by 12 months, will aim to forget last October's tantrum and sign off with a second Super League ring. However, Wigan have their own Old Trafford demons to bury after they were thrashed by the Bulls in the 2001 Grand Final. It has been an unusually quiet off-season at the JJB Stadium, with the big spenders finally forced to come into line with the Super League salary cap, in the process losing David Furner and Gary Connolly to Leeds. But Wigan have started producing their own players again, with Martin Aspinwall, Sean Briscoe, Ricky Bibey, Stephen Wild and Sean O'Loughlin gaining a chunk of senior experience last season and Luke Robinson and Gareth Hock capable of making an even greater impact this year. The hope now is that the Wigan public, who have left rugby league in droves since the days of wintry domination at Central Park, will be tempted back to the JJB Stadium to watch the local lads. However, the early signs have not been encouraging, with fewer than 4,000 at two warm-up games. As ever in pre-season, Leeds have been talking a good game, with the signing of Connolly lifting some of the depression at Headingley. They also have an exciting crop of youngsters - the little scrum-half Rob Burrow and very large prop Ryan Bailey, with Kevin Sinfield appointed as the Super League's freshest-faced captain - but after heavy defeats by Wigan and St Helens in knock-out matches last season, the Rhinos have to prove themselves against the Big Three before they can be taken seriously as contenders. Hull are also outsiders, but beating Halifax with 11 men in the cup last Sunday was the perfect way to start life at their new Kingston Communications Stadium and should ensure five-figure crowds on a regular basis. Richie Barnett and Colin Best add the pace and strike power they have lacked over the past two years, Jason Smith is still there - even if he will miss their first game at Wakefield Trinity after being sent off for a high tackle after all of 15 seconds against Halifax - and Richard Horne is an established international. They could provide much-needed new blood in the Challenge Cup final in Cardiff. Widnes will probably be battling with Castleford, London Broncos and maybe Wakefield for the sixth and final play-off place and with Warrington treading water in their last season at Wilderspool that would leave newly promoted Huddersfield in a private squabble with their neighbours Halifax to avoid finishing bottom for the fourth time in five years. With a new, three-division National League structure beneath the Super League and the summer Conference expanding to 52 clubs, the season was set to start with a mood of optimism, building on last autumn's internationals when Great Britain drew with the Kiwis and England's under-19s beat Australia. Then the Roosters taught St Helens a lesson and put the scale of the challenge facing the Lions in a home Ashes series in November into perspective. Beating the Australia at rugby league would be as likely as, well, the Aussies beating England at football. Predictions: Champions: Bradford. Runners-up: Wigan. Relegated: Huddersfield. Challenge Cup winners: St Helens. Runners-up: Hull."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
