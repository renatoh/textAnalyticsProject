The man was the partner of the girl's mother and was arrested on suspicion of murder. He was discovered in the house with the dead girl Sophie Jade Comins when his partner returned home from a day's work at around 6pm. A neighbour contacted the emergency services shortly afterwards. Police and paramedics arrived at the house in Moorfoot Close on the Bransholme Estate and found the dead girl in an upstairs bedroom. The man, with a number of injuries, was also found. He was arrested and taken to hospital in Hull. A police cordon was thrown around the house and scene of crime officers began forensic investigations. House to house inquiries also began on Saturday night. A Home Office pathologist's report released last night showed the girl had died from manual strangulation. \"The deceased's family has been made aware of the circumstances as we know it so far and are being seen by specially trained police officers,\" a police spokesman said. \"No one else is being sought in relation to this incident, however, police are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity on Saturday in Moorfoot Close to come forward.\" The police would not reveal which hospital the man was in so he could be protected from the victim's relatives. The girl's mother was being cared for by members of her family, also in Hull. An incident room has been set up in Hull which can be contacted on 01482 796275."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
