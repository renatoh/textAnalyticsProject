Lord Edward Somerset, 55, pleaded guilty to four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his wife, Caroline Somerset, between 1990 and 2012. Most of the attacks \u2013 which included bruising, scratching and hair pulling \u2013 took place on the Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, where the couple lived. Somerset, whose father is the Duke of Beaufort, also admitted bruising his wife and dislocating her finger while they were in France. Bristol crown court was told that the attacks often took place after Somerset had been drinking or had taken drugs. The court also heard that Somerset's father, one of the richest men in the country, told his eldest son and heir, the Marquess of Worcester, to meet a relative of Lady Somerset's to discuss the case. During the meeting, it is alleged the Marquess of Worcester spoke of financial arrangements for Lady Somerset and of dropping the case. Judge Mark Horton, who will sentence Somerset in February, told him the offences were so serious a prison sentence could be imposed, and asked him to meet a probation officer. Wearing a blue suit and looking gaunt and unshaven, Somerset spoke only to identify himself and enter guilty pleas to the charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He admitted a \"deliberate and hard\" kick to his wife at Essex House on the Badminton estate between 1 January 2011 and 29 November 2011. Somerset, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to two further assaults that caused bruising to Lady Somerset, on 5 and 6 October 2012. He also admitted assaulting his wife between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2011, causing his wife injuries including a bruise, scratches and pulled hair. His guilty plea for that charge, covering a 21-year period, represented \"incidents of violence between the two, often in drink or drugs or both\", the court heard. Prosecuting, Eleanor Laws QC said Somerset's wife feared him and was seeking a restraining order. \"She would say she still has fears of this defendant because of his offending and she is in a very emotional state,\" Laws said. Laws told the court there had been \"no real direct contact\" between Somerset and his wife. But she said that in October the defendant's elder brother, \"working, so it would seem, on behalf of the defendant's father\", had contacted a relative of Lady Somerset's. During a meeting she said there was \"a discussion about finances, dropping the case, paying for advice for the complainant.\" Laws added that Lady Caroline found out about the meeting. \"It devastated her and put her under considerable stress,\" the prosecutor said. Laws said there was \"nothing to suggest\" Somerset had been behind the meeting. Representing Somerset, William Clegg QC said his client would not oppose a restraining order and added: \"The two haven't seen each other for over a year. He accepts his marriage is completely over.\" Horton released Somerset on conditional bail after advising him to be \"frank with the reality of what has taken place\" during the marriage with the probation service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
