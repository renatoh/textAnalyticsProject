Yesterday, he returned to the July course, on the other side of the heath, to take the season's most important sprint race. It has been a rapid ascent, and the signs are that the summit of Sakhee's Secret's form is still some way ahead of him. Yesterday's July Cup was the first Group race that Hugh Morrison's three-year-old had contested, and there were five previous Group One winners in the field. Yet he still started a narrow second-favourite at 9-2, as the punters placed their faith in the apparent brilliance of his performance at Salisbury last month. Promise and potential often amounts to little when it is tested at the highest level, but Sakhee's Secret travelled like a high-class sprinter from the off and took command of the race when Steve Drowne sent him ahead just inside the final furlong. Dutch Art, another three-year-old, was the only opponent who managed to go after him, but Sakhee's Secret had half a length to spare at the line, and looked as though he could have found more if required. It is a rare horse that can win a Group One at the first time of asking without any prior experience of Group-race competition. \"I think he'd be the best sprinter we've seen for a few years,\" Drowne said. \"He's beaten the older horses, he's unbeaten this year. These days, sprinters seem to come and go, but he's got the sort of profile to be around for a year or two. I'm lucky enough to have ridden a few quick ones, but he's got to be the best of them. He can only get better, too, he's got everything ahead of him.\" Having made such an impressive debut in Group One company, Sakhee's Secret is unlikely to see much else during the rest of the season. \"He's shown so much speed that you wouldn't be frightened about coming back to five furlongs,\" Morrison said, \"and he's in the Nunthorpe [over five] at York and also in the Haydock Sprint Cup. You can never quite believe a horse is that good when they've only won a Listed race, so it's a great performance to go up so many grades in one go.\" Hatta Fort came from well off the pace to win the Group Two Superlative Stakes in the hands of Hugh Bowman, who had not ridden a winner for nearly a month. He was happy to sit in last place for much of the race, then quickened to lead inside the final furlong and held the late charge of Declaration Of War by a neck. \"We thought he would win at Royal Ascot but the five furlongs in the Windsor Castle Stakes was just a bit sharp for him,\" Mick Channon, Hatta Fort's trainer, said. \"The ground is another big difference today, it's nice to get some decent ground rather than the bogs we've been racing on recently. \"We'll have to think about where to go from here as he'll get a Group Two penalty now, but I'd expect to keep him at seven furlongs next time.\" The admirable Mine's attempt to win a fourth Bunbury Cup was a disappointing anti-climax as he could finish only 12th of 18 behind Giganticus, while the handicap for three-year-olds which opened the card could produce plenty of winners over the next few weeks. Tybalt, who finished strongly to beat Artimino and Well Come, had not enjoyed much luck so far this season, but his success was a compliment to Tobosa, who gave him a thorough beating at Haydock last time. \"He might run in the Totesport Mile at Goodwood, and then we will head to the States with him,\" John Gosden, Tybalt's trainer, said afterwards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
