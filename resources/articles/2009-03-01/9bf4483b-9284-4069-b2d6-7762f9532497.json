The British number one was hoping to build on his run to the final in Indian Wells last weekend but had to recover from a poor start to defeat Juan Monaco 4-6 6-3 6-2. Monaco, who turns 25 tomorrow, was inspired in the opening set but, having missed a chance to break in the opening game of the second, faded badly as Murray gradually took control in the pair's first meeting. Monaco created the first opening in the third game as Murray struggled to find his range, and the world number 59 finally took advantage on his third break point. The Argentinian was playing near faultless tennis and Murray looked frustrated by his failure to break down his opponent, who was frequently taking the initiative in rallies. It got worse for Murray in the fifth game as Monaco claimed a second break to love, although the Scot turned the tables in the next game to at least pull the score back to 4-2. Murray saved further break points in the seventh game but then failed to take his one chance to break back as Monaco wrapped up the first set 6-4. The 21-year-old was on the back foot at the start of the second set as well, the Argentinian winning the first three points on Murray's serve. But this time the Scot stood firm and he should have gone a break ahead in the next game. A net cord seemed to have set him up perfectly but Monaco's desperate retrieval landed just inside the baseline. Murray looked somewhat ill at ease, which was surprising given he trains in Miami over the winter and bought an apartment in the city last year. However, he was gradually getting the upper hand and secured the break in the fourth game. Murray began to play with authority and a shanked Monaco return saw him level at one-set all. Monaco was up at 14th in the world last January but has slid down the rankings considerably since then and struggled to rediscover his form of the opening set. Murray duly broke again in the first game of the decider but Monaco showed he had some fight left by levelling immediately. A third successive break gave the British number one the advantage again and from there he eased to victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
