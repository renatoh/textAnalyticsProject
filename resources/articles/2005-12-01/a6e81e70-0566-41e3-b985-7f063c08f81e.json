It was also announced that the Henley MP would be stepping down as editor of the Spectator to take up the brief. The new Tory leader, David Cameron, has brought Mr Johnson back to the frontbench a little over a year after he was sacked as shadow arts minister. Mr Johnson lost that brief in November 2004 after a row with the then party leader, Michael Howard, over his failure to reveal an extra-marital affair. He was already in hot water at the time, after writing an editorial accusing the city of Liverpool of parading its grief after the killing of local businessman Ken Bigley in Iraq. Other appointments tonight in Mr Cameron's ongoing reshuffle were John Hayes, who becomes shadow minister for vocational education, Stephen O'Brien, who becomes shadow minister for health, and Owen Paterson, who takes over as shadow minister for transport. After his election as party leader on Tuesday with a convincing 2-1 margin over David Davis, Mr Cameron made William Hague his new shadow foreign secretary and leadership rival Liam Fox the shadow defence secretary. However, contrary to expectation, he kept Mr Davis in the home affairs role. Next week Mr Cameron will make a major speech in Leeds on improving candidate selection - especially that of women. He has already this week announced two major policy reviews, of social justice and of the environment. In a statement Mr Johnson said: \"This is a fantastic job and I am thrilled to be given the chance to do it. It is also a very hard job to do properly. It will mean a lot of time and thought. \"That is why I will be leaving the Spectator shortly after the Christmas edition has gone to press. Until a new editor is appointed, the magazine will be in the highly-capable hands of my colleague and deputy Stuart Reid.\" Mr Johnson was careful to thank colleagues at the magazine. \"For most of my time here I have been propelled by their talents, as a fat German tourist may be transported by superior alpinists to the summit of Everest.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
