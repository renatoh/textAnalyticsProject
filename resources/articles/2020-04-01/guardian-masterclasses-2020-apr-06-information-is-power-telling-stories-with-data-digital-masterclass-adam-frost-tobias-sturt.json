In unprecedented times, we turn to data to inform our understanding of a situation, as much as our decisions around it. As our national dialogue evolves with technology and we continue to turn to data for answers, accuracy - as much as aesthetics - is essential. In this data visualisation masterclass with experts Adam Frost and Tobias Sturt, you will be shown how to choose data that frames your storytelling in a way that is informative and beautiful. You will also learn the importance of having a clear narrative for your dataset, and the practical techniques you can use to turn raw data into striking visual stories. This highly practical course covers the basics of data visualisation and is suitable for anyone with an interest in using data to tell stories. It is not a beginner course, but you do not need to have advanced knowledge. You will be sent a link to the webinar 1hr before the start time of 10am (BST).
