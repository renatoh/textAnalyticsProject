He is putting the final touches to his speech for this week's Conservative party conference, the launch pad for what he hopes will be a third-time-lucky run for the party's leadership. Asked why he is giving it another go at the age of 65 - sacrificing a backbench role that has left ample time for his beloved cricket and football, jazz evenings and birdwatching holidays, not to mention lucrative business ties including, controversially, BAT (formerly British American Tobacco) - he speaks of his passion for politics, his despair at seeing the Tories become 'a permanent party of opposition,' and his anger at the way Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are governing Britain. But what really drives the former Chancellor is a desire to be back on the main political stage. For a politician, he says, 'Everything is second best to being at the centre of events, and having the chance to put my party back into power.' And he is up for the battle - particularly relishing, he says, the chance to take aim at New Labour from the Blackpool conference platform on Tuesday. 'I've been asked to speak on the economy, which is an ideal opportunity to attack Gordon Brown,' he told The Observer. 'I've got to try to persuade the conference that they've only got one big beast in the party at the moment - against the big beast in the Labour Party that is going to take over from Blair.' In any other politician, this would sound simply arrogant. With Clarke, it's part of the package: unselfconscious, and above all unspun - in itself, his campaign backers freely admit, a useful piece of spin. It is not just the cigar, or the riverside vista, that lend a sense of serene self-confidence to his words as he holds forth on his vision for party and country. He clearly feels that his time has finally come: that British voters, weary of what he calls 'policy-making by special advisers' and deeply sceptical of all politicians, are ready to warm to a 'common-sense, centre-ground' leader who says what he thinks and will do what he says. Still more so, one who was against the war in Iraq. Crucially, following a week when two of his main rivals, David Davis and David Cameron, launched their campaigns, Clarke is also betting that with polls consistently showing him as giving the party the best hope of winning back voters, fellow Tories may be sufficiently tired of losing general elections to back him. They may even be ready to set aside the Euro-enthusiasm and Commons 'unclubbabilty' which have denied him the crown in the past. Confident though Clarke sounds, he knows that is no sure bet, though he hopes to benefit from a stirring podium performance at conference. Under election rules almost guaranteed to encourage horse-trading, the 198 MPs will hold a series of secret ballots to narrow the field to two for a final vote by grassroots party members in early December. Muddying things further is the fact that all of the other candidates are standing on a distinctly Clarke-sounding, though Eurosceptic, platform. He seems unruffled. 'I'm rather amused by the fact that, as is always the case in Tory leadership elections, all five candidates are insisting they are centre-ground politicians,' he remarks drily, saying 'that is news to me', particularly in the case of Davis, the current front runner. The tone of voice as Clarke outlines his policy prescription seems deliberately pitched to separate a big beast from the rest of the Tory jungle. It is less soapbox than fireside chat. There are no flights of rhetoric, no dazzling new policy formulas - he particularly dislikes the fondness of new-fangled British politicians, New Labour or New Tory, for 'management-speak or think-tank ideas'. That kind of thing, he contends, is precisely what has made the Conservatives so good at losing elections of late. He seems determined to keep his own message simple: the next election will be won by the party leader closest to Britain's political centre of gravity. On a whole range of issues - the economy, public service reform, anti-terror legislation, Iraq - New Labour is heading for trouble, he contends. They have won three elections by borrowing Tory policies - in some cases, he can't help adding, his policies. The need now for the Tories is straightforward: credibly to claim back the centre ground and to convince the electorate that they can be trusted to run Britain better than Blair and Brown. The key question as the Tories decamp for Blackpool is whether Clarke can get his fellow MPs, and then the country, to vote for him - and the key obstacle will still be his pro-European views. Most Tories who won their seats for the first time in 2005 - a group that accounts for more than one-quarter of Conservative MPs - are fundamentally Eurosceptic. Two of the party's leading business supporters - spread-betting millionaire Stuart Wheeler and Dixons boss Sir Stanley Kalms - last week publicly suggested that Clarke's pro-European views would make it impossible for him to lead a united party. Kalms went further. A former party treasurer, active campaigner against closer involvement in the EU - and a Davis backer - he indicated he would cease all involvement in a party led by Clarke. Clarke has tried to finesse the problem by arguing that two of the most burning European issues - whether Britain should join the single currency and the ratification of the EU's new draft constitution - have been kicked into touch by realities on the ground. But that clearly hasn't convinced at least some fellow MPs, not to mention the rival leadership contenders. Why, they ask, shouldn't Labour deliberately raise Europe at every opportunity if Clarke becomes leader, lighting the political touchpaper and watching the Tories set themselves ablaze? Clarke argues that Blair - himself an enthusiast for a constitution that is effectively dead - would be the last person to gain from reopening such a debate: 'And I don't say that Europe is no longer an issue. There is a very, very big European agenda: reform of the EU. That is again something we started and which we're much better placed than Labour to do.' And what if - despite the poll boosts and his big-beast credentials - Clarke is for the third time undone by Europe? He takes another puff on his cigar and says he genuinely thinks that would be bad for the Conservatives, that voters would see them as 'Eurobores', obsessed with 'theological issues' that do not fundamentally preoccupy most Britons. And how will he sway MPs who, with equal force, argue that Europe is just too important an issue to ignore in choosing their leader? Again, he pauses, then smiles, and replies matter-of-factly: 'I will try to convince them that we need to win an election.' There are other issues of course: some critics say Clarke is aloof, that his refusal to give up his BAT directorship unless he wins the leadership reveals a disdain for the rules of ordinary politics. And frankly, they say, he seems too laid-back to bother with pressing the flesh and endless constituency dinners to persuade fellow MPs and the wider party to place themselves in his hands. It's a criticism he has been slow to grasp: 'It rather surprises me really. I regard myself as rather gregarious and I do think I'm on good personal terms with all of my colleagues.' But with a diary full not only with politics but a famously crowded array of other diversions, he has been forced to recognise there is truth in what the critics say: 'When I moved into this office, I kept saying every day that I must go across to the Palace, and keep in touch. But, looking back, I probably don't hang around schmoozing. And if you become Leader of the Opposition, or Prime Minister, it is important that you resist the urge to fill every moment of the diary and you do go across and find out what Parliamentary opinion is - simply by listening.' Must do better seems the message, then. But Clarke is equally urging the rest of the party to do some listening of its own - to voters beyond a core of Tory faithful who will never be sufficient in themselves to get the Conservatives back into government. 'We've made ourselves seem irrelevant to a great deal of the mainstream of British politics,' he says. 'We have fought elections on very narrow issues. We have failed to maintain clear, up-to-date positions on the big issues that matter to the electorate.' Blair confidently assured last week's Labour conference in Brighton that his party had won - and would hold - the centre ground of politics. 'The Conservatives,' retorts Clarke, 'have to provide a better competitor.' He, for one, harbours no doubt who that competitor is, or where the key battle must be waged. 'It all starts with the old cliche - it's the economy, stupid,' says the man who, as the last Conservative Chancellor, is widely credited with the solid economic legacy inherited by Brown in 1997. 'You can't win an election unless you're credible on the economy. 'It astonishes me that we've fought two general election campaigns without trying seriously to discuss the economy. It's no good Tories going around giving coded messages whether they're in favour of tax cuts or not, or pulling rabbits out of the hat with ideas like flat taxes... Above all else, you've got to get across the idea that you can run the economy better than the present government.' Perhaps it is because of some tacit bond between big beasts - though it clearly does no harm for Clarke to drive home the need for the Tories to choose a politician of his experience to slay the dragon-in-waiting - but Clarke is at pains to stress how highly he rates Brown: 'I have a lot of respect for him. He's a serious, heavyweight politician. He's not to be underestimated on any front. He's serious when it comes to policy. He knows what he's talking about - and I've never thought he was an extreme left-winger, but a real reformer. He is a formidable figure.' Yet, having inherited a sound economy, Brown has now 'turned into a tax-and-spend chancellor. He's had a good lucky run. But it's running out, with the debt problem beginning to come up. And we're heading for a slowdown - with Gordon, typically, the last person finally to admit that his forecasts were ridiculous.' Clarke adds another, more fundamental, criticism of Blair's heir-apparent - New Labour's 'debasement' of old-style British Parliamentary government: 'Gordon's a complete control-freak. He makes Blair look like a team player. He has a tiny closed entourage to run things. He tries to interfere in detail in every aspect of government - as Chancellor. What he'd be like as Prime Minister, heaven forfend. The cabinet will probably no longer meet: they'll be given written instructions.' Clarke has clearly been doing a lot of thinking about what he might do if he finally gets the keys to Number 10 - the one top domestic office of government to have eluded him. On some issues - notably Iraq - the differences with Blair and Brown, and with his Tory rivals, are stark. While Clarke is careful to emphasise that 'you can't just pull out', he is sharply critical of the current criteria for how and when Britain will begin to disengage. 'We're saying: it's when the Iraqis ask us to,' he complains, contending that since with 'America calling the shots', Britain could end up involved in an open-ended enterprise with little account of its own national interests. On other issues, he offers a mix of support and criticism of the government - for ID cards, for instance, but 'vehemently' against making it a criminal offence to carry them; strongly critical of some aspects of Blair's proposed new anti-terror laws; supportive of anti-social behaviour orders and also of extended licensing hours, in both cases as long as the rules are properly applied. But far more interesting than his specific policy views - and more revealing of how he sees the route back to government for the Tories - is how little concerned he seems with his party's recent preoccupation to put clear blue water between itself as New Labour. That, he suggests, has been part of the problem. What is needed, he says - with a passing swipe at, Davis, the leading right-of-centre candidate - is a 'non-ideological' policy package aimed at emphasising a core concern with good government. After all, Clarke delights in pointing out, some of New Labour's policies strike him as oddly familiar, at least on paper. The government's commitment to high-quality, widely accessible public services and to choice of provision 'sounds just like me 15 years ago', he says, with a laugh. Yet there, he argues, the similarity ends: a 'bewildering and incompetent stream of instructions from the middle' was 'giving reform a bad name'. If he were in charge, the emphasis would be on 'reform on a human scale, with regard to realities on the ground. At every stage, you have to ask: is this another step towards providing a better quality of service, or a quality of education, to ever more people?' But the key to any credible Tory policy on public services, he says, is to make clear that 'better public services mean that they must remain free at the point of use, financed from general taxation, and ensure quality of access to high-quality service for every section of society'. There have been suggestions from some Tories, he says, that the party should back vouchers or in effect 'subsidise public school fees or subsidise private health care... If the public services are seen as a kind of residual service for the poor, who can't afford to buy a better service for themselves, then in my opinion you're on a firm downward path. Don't think that you will ever get the British public to vote for that. And you wouldn't get me to vote for that.' This is Clarke's make-or-break week. With his Hush Puppies and rumpled suits, he is in sharp contrast to the other candidates. This will be his last chance to start on a route that could lead to Number 10. His fortune is now in the hands of 198 MPs and the party as a whole. If they back him, British voters will get the chance to decide if he will achieve what he has always craved - to be Prime Minister. Clarke on... The Tories 'We have made ourselves irrelevant... we have failed to maintain clear, up-to-date positions on the mainstream issues that matter to the electorate' ... Himself 'I regard myself as rather gregarious, and think I'm on good personal terms with all of my colleagues' ... Europe 'I don't say Europe is no longer an issue. There is a very big European issue: reform. It is again something we started and are much better placed than Labour to do' Gordon Brown I have a lot of respect for him. He's a serious heavyweight. He's not to be underestimated on any front. A formidable figure...' ...The economy 'It astonishes me that we've fought two general election campaigns without trying seriously to discuss the economy'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
