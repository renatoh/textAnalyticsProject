The move comes as airlines warn passengers to arrive at airports in good time with the introduction of busy summer flight schedules this weekend. With more passengers and tight security checks, carriers fear it will take people longer to get through airport procedures. Low-cost airlines, which have traditionally allowed later check-in times, are now changing their policies. Ryanair is changing the limit to 40 minutes from today. A spokeswoman said queues at security mean passengers should allow longer to reach the departure gate. 'Check-in desks open two hours before departure time and we strongly recommend passengers check in early, especially if they are checking in baggage or require special assistance.' EasyJet, which has already switched to a 40-minute minimum check-in, said passengers should ideally turn up one and a half hours before a flight. 'We are very strict,' said a spokeswoman. 'When the gate is closed, figures are calculated about the weight of the aircraft to determine how much fuel is needed. So, even if people turn up a few minutes late, we cannot let them on the flight. 'There'll always be people who are late because of problems getting to the airport, but in general people are more aware of the need to arrive in plenty of time.' EasyJet is launching 38 routes in the next few months, including Newcastle to Nice and Mallorca on 15 April; London Gatwick to Faro, Naples and Prague (23 April) and to Ibiza on 3 June. Most of the new services are from Newcastle, Gatwick, Luton, Bristol and Stansted, so passengers using these airports need to be most careful about time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
