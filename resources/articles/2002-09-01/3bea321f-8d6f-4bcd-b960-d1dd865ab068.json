Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson withdrew Paul Scholes and David Beckham from the England squad even though they played against Middlesbrough on Tuesday night, while Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has also spoken out against international friendlies. But Owen, who will stand in as captain in Beckham's absence on Saturday, admits he can see both sides of the argument. \"I am with one of the clubs that has high-profile games so I can see the club-versus-country row from both sides,\" he said. \"But, from my point of view, I love joining up with England, and whenever I've been fit the manager has never come up to me and said, 'You're not joining up with England'. Whenever I've been fit I've been allowed to join up.\" In the press conference today, Owen also insisted that, come the 2004 European Championships in Portugal and the World Cup in 2006, England can be a force to be reckoned with. \"A lot has been said since the World Cup and I think we'll have a meeting tonight. We are only going to have a general chat about what happened, it will be very brief but the main part will be on the future. It'll be an exercise to improve our performances and do well in forthcoming fixtures,\" he said. \"I said before the World Cup that, as much as we had a good side and a realistic chance of going far, the best of this team is yet to come. \"Certainly the World Cup in Germany looks to be when everyone will be in their prime but two years on in Portugal everyone will have played lots of games together.\" Owen will captain Leeds defender Jonathan Woodgate on his return to the international scene after an enforced break. Woodgate returns after winning one cap in 1999 along with Leeds team-mate Lee Bowyer, who was available for selection and came straight into Sven-Goran Eriksson's squad. Owen is confident both Elland Road players can add something new to the England side. \"I think everyone in the team is under scrutiny, especially playing for England, it is understandable. Jonathan has played before and played well. He's been away a long time and it's nice see them both in the squad. \"They are both very good players and will want to take their club form into the international arena. \"Jonathan is a very good player. You don't play regularly as a centre-back at a young age if you are not any good, it is a high-pressure position. \"Bowyer has always been a good player. He's different to other midfielders, he's got a big engine and scores a lot of goals.\" Owen is confident his own form is good, despite missing a host of chances in Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Newcastle on Monday evening. \"I was very pleased with my last performance. After the Newcastle game the back pages were going to say I missed chances but that was the best game I have played in a long time. \"I know that if I get the chances I'll score more than I miss.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
