No one is suggesting they are suddenly invincible but, compared with 12 months ago, the difference is almost tangible. The catalyst? Examine their fortunes before and after Toby Flood was trusted to start ahead of Jonny Wilkinson last March and it is hard not to make a direct link. Flood's man-of-the-match performance against Wales last Friday simply underlined the new order. Credit has tended to go elsewhere but England, at this precise moment, would not swap him for any other fly-half in the championship. Quietly and intelligently, he has unlocked areas of England's game which had rusted up, to the point where opponents are unsure what is coming next. At Test level, that is the most precious of gifts. The 25-year-old Flood has also shown what a little artfully channelled ambition can do. Beginning in Paris and continuing through Sydney, Twickenham and Cardiff there has been a much greater desire to cast off the imaginative shackles. Anyone who saw England's game against Italy in Rome last year \u2013 an uninspiring 17-12 victory derided by virtually everyone except the then captain, Steve Borthwick, who misguidedly hailed it as \"fantastic\" \u2013 will know how grim things had become. The Azzurri may struggle to recognise their opponents at Twickenham this Saturday. Flood, for one, is keen to demonstrate that times have changed radically. \"The Italy game last year was a real low. We got sucked into a bit of kick tennis, played poorly and didn't back ourselves. We fell into the type of game that suits Italy very well. I agree, a big performance felt a long way off. I think there's a lot more honesty and openness now in the squad. \" Only in France, with Wilkinson on the bench and Flood starting, did the emphasis finally shift. Flood slightly demurs \u2013 \"It had started before that Paris game ... it wasn't as if a lightbulb had suddenly gone on\" \u2013 but accepts forwards and backs alike now have a very different mindset. The key, he believes, is improved communication. \"There's a lot more honesty and a more open relationship between everyone. I can say anything to Mike Ford or Brian Smith and I expect to hear the same things back. \"I'm not going to take it as an insult, or think they're having a go at me. If we were all pulling in different directions that would have a negative impact but we all want to make the team better. There's a huge flow of information now.\" Flood's move to Leicester, which has introduced him to an atmosphere in which winning is non-negotiable, has also tightened up his game management and boosted his confidence. \"I feel more comfortable but that's also been facilitated by the change in tactics. \"We're in a position now where we want to challenge the opposition. We're not sitting there thinking: 'If we kick long we'll be all right because our defence will hold up.' We now feel we can have a massive crack at teams from the outset. There will be occasions when we live or die by it but that's what's going to happen.\" There has been precious little freedom of expression when England have met Italy in recent times, a trend of which the hosts on Saturday are keenly aware. This time they are determined not to be dragged into a suffocating wrestling match. \"We're very aware what may come this weekend but you have to be good enough to deal with that,\" said Flood, who will be winning his 37th cap. \"We have to raise our standards and be smart enough to get away from that. When teams go out just to spoil it makes it very tough but if you get your basics right you can hopefully lay your own footmark on the game. \"It'll take a long time to change the stereotype of English rugby but it's nice to be able to go out and chuck it around a bit because we have the ball players who can do that. It's a balance, isn't it? You don't want to run your own forwards off their feet so they've got nothing left. It's about making sure you wear the opposition down as much as possible and having the ability to spread it when they are tired.\" It is also Flood's sense that England can get appreciably better, not least his inside centre, Shontayne Hape, whom he predicts \"will make massive progress\" between now and the World Cup. \"I don't think we played well against Wales ... we did some good things but it wasn't fantastically brilliant. There's still a huge amount to work on. \"Johnno [Martin Johnson] wanted to get across to us that we'd made a couple of errors in important parts of the pitch. Our communication let us down a little bit and we let them back into the game from 14 points up, which you can't do in international rugby.\" There was nothing wrong with Flood's head-up awareness of space which created Chris Ashton's first try, nor his marksmanship. With Wilkinson available to step off the bench and complete the job in the final quarter, England are now enjoying the best of both worlds. Italy may have squeezed the life out of Ireland but, if Flood has his way, England will be harder to subdue this time around."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
