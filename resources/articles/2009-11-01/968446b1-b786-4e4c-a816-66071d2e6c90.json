It was not until Scott McDonald delivered the third goal in the second half \u2013 adding to a Chris Innes own goal, Georgios Samaras's effort and St Mirren's counter from Michael Higdon \u2013 that Tony Mowbray's side shrugged off their uncertainty and began to look reasonably convincing. McDonald contrived to deny himself another by allowing Paul Gallacher to save his penalty in stoppage time after Innes had handled. The two-goal burst from McDonald and Samaras late in the first half, however, provided a much-needed fillip for Celtic players who had spent the preceding 36 minutes as bland and unthreatening as they have been for much of this season. Even Rangers' first defeat of the season, inflicted by Aberdeen earlier, seemed insufficient to inspire a home side that seem to take ever longer these days to establish pace, rhythm and incisiveness. Instead, even opponents as unfancied as St Mirren are frequently allowed to settle into the kind of comfort zone that nourishes belief in their ability to frustrate their hosts and take away a souvenir of the party. It is unlikely to have helped that Barry Robson, the midfielder widely recognised as Celtic's most efficient player in their previous fixture, the defeat at Tannadice, was on the bench for this one. Robson's absence may not have been entirely to blame \u2013 he would eventually replace Zheng Zhi in the 85th minute \u2013 but there was certainly a lack of cohesion and a general lopsidedness about the home side which, until the opener, seriously reduced their prospects of inflicting damage on the visitors' goal. When the strike came, it was simply worked. Samaras took a pass from Aiden McGeady and held the ball until his little partner scampered into position. The tall Greek rolled the ball into his path and McDonald, from the right side of the area, found the far corner with a shot that was deflected over the line by Innes. The second goal was similar, McGeady on this occasion breaking through the middle before leaving Samaras with only Gallacher to beat and the striker drilled the ball low and far to the goalkeeper's right. Celtic, though, seem incapable of completing a game without at least one slip and it came right on the interval when Marc Crosas, from a cross by Billy Mehmet, stabbed the ball towards his goal, but palpably short, allowing the substitute Higdon to drive the ball past Lukasz Zaluska. The two-goal advantage was restored when McDonald scored unaided during a period when the Celtic players produced some of their most pleasing football of the season and appeared, for a change, to be enjoying themselves. The execution of the goal was the hallmark of men happy in their work. Gary Caldwell's long pass out of defence fell from the sky and was brilliantly killed and moved on in one dazzling piece of skill by McGeady. As he moved to the dead ball line, McDonald bolted to the near post, put in a perfect cross and the Aussie striker had merely to stretch out his right foot to direct the ball past Gallacher from six yards. McGeady's unusually mature performance had much to do with Celtic's overall impressiveness during the second half, the Republic of Ireland winger often finding team-mates with telling passes and crosses from the right. Such productivity has been a rarity with him over the years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
