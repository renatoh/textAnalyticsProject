Our panelists' verdicts", "bodyText": "Kate Aronoff: Democrats \u2013 and America \u2013 need better than Biden Joe Biden has been running for president on the idea that he\u2019s the best equipped to beat Donald Trump. Tonight\u2019s debate shed considerable doubt on that premise. If this is how he performs against his opponents on the same side of the aisle \u2013 clinging desperately to the legacy of an administration he didn\u2019t lead \u2013 then how do we think he\u2019ll fare against the most talented bully in American politics? Other candidates performed impressively. Bernie Sanders had the clearest ideas on how to improve the lives of people in this country and take on vested interests hoarding wealth and power. But Kamala Harris delivered the night\u2019s and possibly the cycle\u2019s most powerful moment when she challenged Biden on his history of supporting racist policies and politicians. In response, he got as defensive as a grandfather going up against his kids at a Thanksgiving table, taking pains to clarify precisely which type of desegregation he opposed in the 1970s. America deserves better. Kate Aronoff is a writing fellow at In These Times. She covers elections and the politics of climate change Art Cullen: One of the real winners was actually Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris wowed early when, during shouting chaos among the 10 candidates, she reminded the other candidates that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t want a food fight; they want to know how to put food on the table\u201d. She was powerful, precise and put her formidable legal skills to work on camera attacking Joe Biden\u2019s record on race and bussing. Biden worked hard to tie himself to President Obama and aggressively defend his civil rights record, but he struggled under Harris\u2019s withering prosecutor-style cross-examination. One of the debate\u2019s other winners wasn\u2019t even present: Elizabeth Warren \u2013 who, along with Harris, has clearly taken Bernie Sanders\u2019 mantle as flag-bearer for the progressive base. Sanders started the revolution, but Warren and Harris seem poised to execute it. Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in Iowa and won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. He is the author of Storm Lake: A Chronicle of Change, Resilience, and Hope Moira Donegan: Harris was the only real standout At once more scripted, less policy-oriented, and more emptily contentious than Wednesday\u2019s debate, the second Democratic presidential debate was mostly a competition to outshine the current frontrunner, Joe Biden. Kamala Harris succeeded; few of the other candidates managed to convey their message as effectively. Harris emphasized economic justice and conveyed her policy agenda through a series of morally charged anecdotes about struggling families, including her own: she adeptly attacked Biden\u2019s record on race by invoking her own childhood as a beneficiary of school bussing. She also had one of the best sound bites of the night, when the debate devolved into one of several shouting matches: \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight; they want to know how we\u2019re going to put food on the table.\u201d Biden tried to continue coasting on leftover goodwill from his time in the Obama administration, delivering answers thin on details and thick with platitudes. His vague and non-committal description of the country he would build as president seemed to accomplish little aside from reifying the message he gave rich donors at a recent fundraiser: \u201cNothing would fundamentally change.\u201d Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist Malaika Jabali: No one really won In a Democratic debate that was obnoxious, contentious, and spent the first 30 minutes largely setting up socialism and progressive policies \u2013 like free healthcare, free education, and taxing the wealthy \u2013 as impracticable and not the popular positions that they are, no one really won. Nevertheless, within these confines Kamala Harris succeeded. She was assertive but composed, she forcefully addressed racism, and she pushed Biden on his anti-bussing record. Her prosecutorial record will be scrutinized as the race draws on, but tonight she has much to celebrate. Malaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, writer, and activist whose writing has appeared in Essence, Jacobin, the Intercept, Glamour and elsewhere Geoffrey Kabaservice: Biden was out of step with his own party Kamala Harris was the standout in tonight\u2019s debate, bringing a force, focus, and fire that had been missing since her campaign rollout. Her gains came directly at Joe Biden\u2019s expense and punctured the image he\u2019d cultivated of an above-the-fray front runner. Their viral clash on bussing as a means of achieving racial balance in schools hammered home not only how out of step Biden is with the Democratic left\u2019s evolving stance on identity issues but also his age \u2013 since Harris was a schoolchild when Biden was cutting deals with former segregationists. Harris\u2019s victory may be pyrrhic, however, since bussing is an unpopular subject with a long history of widening divisions between Democrats.

While the other candidates had their moments, there was no doubt that the applause and focused interest in the room was behind those three. As someone who organizes religious people to vote for Democratic candidates, I found it interesting to hear the enthusiastic and prolonged applause for Pete Buttigieg when he said that the Christian faith calls us to care for kids and not put them in cages and he called out the hypocrisy of the Trump administration. It seemed like an indicator that there is interest and enthusiasm for Democratic candidates who talk about faith. Of all the candidates, Biden issued the most forceful denunciations of Trump, and the crowd ate it up. But by the end of the debate it became clear how much passion there is for Harris. I\u2019m not sure how it came across on television, but to those of us inside the room she projected powerful charisma and confidence.
