The transportation department fined the automaker $35m, the maximum penalty, earlier this year after GM recalled 2.6m cars with faulty ignition switches or other problems. Senator Claire McCaskill, chairwoman of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection, accused NHTSA at a hearing Tuesday of failing to pick up on a trend of consumer complaints about GM cars because \u201cmuch like institutional problems at GM,\u201d the regulator \u201coperated in a siloed environment, where one division is often unaware of what may be happening in another division.\u201d McCaskill said the lack of oversight had created \u201can environment that is colored with a crisis\u201d of deadly vehicle flaws. NHTSA deputy administrator David J Friedman sharply rejected the analogy. \u201cThere was a clear difference in what happened between NHTSA and General Motors in this situation,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cNHTSA was actively trying to find the ball. General Motors was actively trying to hide the ball. It wasn\u2019t simply incompetence on their part. They had policies in place to not mention the word \u2018defect,\u2019 in order to shield information from NHTSA.\u201d McCaskill conceded that primary culpability lay with the carmaker, which an earlier government investigation found had committed a \u201cfailure to report a safety defect in the vehicle to the federal government in a timely manner.\u201d The number of deaths attributed to GM\u2019s failure to correct known vehicle flaws jumped from 13 to 19 on Monday, according to the lawyer overseeing compensation payouts, with some critics saying the number is much higher. \u201cI agree that GM is primarily at fault here,\u201d McCaskill said. She has presented legislation to increase the cap on penalties for vehicle safety violations and to increase the regulator\u2019s budget for auto safety enforcement. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Friedman rejected the results of a New York Times investigation published on Friday that said NHTSA had ignored as many as 2,000 consumer complaints about flawed GM vehicles. \u201cThe information in that article is very misleading,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re talking about is an incident rate that is in the few thousandths of a percent. It was not a very large signal in comparison to the stalls that we were seeing in other cases.\u201d Friedman said NHTSA had conducted 42 investigations of complaints about stalling in the last decade and issued 31 recalls. \u201cWhen we find the data that indicates there\u2019s a defect or a defect trend, we have followed it,\u201d he said. A separate House of Representatives report published Tuesday found that NHTSA has been struggling to keep up with technological advances and other changes in the auto industry. In addition, the regulator suffers from a vacancy at the top, having lost its director in January. The Obama administration has yet to nominate a replacement. \u201cI would urge the White House to make filling the vacancy for the nation\u2019s top auto and safety official a priority,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cEspecially as the agency evaluates its personnel and financial resource needs and continues to work to modernize in order to keep pace with an auto industry far more technologically advanced than it, NHTSA needs an administrator and a deputy administrator \u2013 not one person doing both jobs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
