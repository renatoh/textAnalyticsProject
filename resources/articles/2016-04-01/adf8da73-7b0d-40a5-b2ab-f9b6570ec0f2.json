The new weekly discussion show, called The Pledge, is Sky\u2019s take on programmes including BBC\u2019s Question Time and ITV\u2019s The Agenda. However, the broadcaster says that its new show is unique to British television because the panellists will discuss \u201cburning issues\u201d without a moderator to control the debate. Each week five panellists, from a pool of nine, will appear on the show each raising an issue that will be thrashed out among the group. \u201cThis is something really different for a TV news platform,\u201d said John McAndrew, director of content for Sky News. \u201cStraight-talking, opinionated contributors, no conventional host. We are really excited.\u201d The pool of panellists includes LBC breakfast show host Nick Ferrari, Dragons\u2019 Den tycoon James Caan, TV presenter June Sarpong, former England footballer Graeme Le Saux, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry and Telegraph journalist Emma Barnett. Sky said the show has taken its name from a pledge that each of the panellists have made \u201cto talk straight and tell it like it really is\u201d. The first show, which will be filmed at Sky Studios in Osterley, will air from 8pm to 9pm every Thursday from 21 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
