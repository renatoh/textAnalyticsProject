The five partners - including the Saatchi brothers and chief executive David Kershaw - will each make about \u00a34.5m by selling 40% of their shares in the company, and will keep stakes worth a further \u00a36.7m each. Holding on to the equity will allow them, along with other managers who will benefit from the proposed flotation, to retain control of the company. \"At this stage we still want to feel that our destiny is in our hands,\" Mr Kershaw said today. \"That's the way we can best serve new shareholders.\" M&amp;C Saatchi - founded nine years ago as a breakaway from the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi empire - is set to be worth \u00a370m when it goes public, with 40% of the shares made available to new investors. The remaining 60% will be split between the five founders, who also number Bill Muirhead and Jeremy Sinclair, and around 20 other top-ranking staff. The founders, who, with the exception of Charles Saatchi, are all becoming executive directors of the new plc, are also handing their rights to an incentive scheme to managers. Charles Saatchi is no longer an active partner. His brother, Maurice, will split his time \"half and half\" between the agency and his duties as the co-chairman of the Conservative party, Mr Kershaw said. \"There's no one in the world who's not likely to take a call from Maurice - the half of his time he spends with us is invaluable,\" he said. Mr Kershaw said the company, which has its main office in London and another 13 offices worldwide, would be using \u00a310m raised in the flotation to open nine offices within the next two years. M&amp;C Saatchi is prioritising continental Europe, where it has no presence at the moment, and is set to open four offices in France, Italy, Spain and Germany. It has also earmarked five cities in Asia, where it already has seven offices, for new headquarters by the end of 2006. They are Beijing, Jakarta, Seoul, Bangkok and Delhi. It intends to bolster the operations of its two existing US offices, in New York and Los Angeles, rather than move into new cities. The company will look to eastern Europe and Russia for further growth beyond the next two years. M&amp;C Saatchi wants to use its \"80:20\" model at new operations, whereby it takes an 80% stake in the business and gives the other 20% to handpicked local management to keep them loyal and motivated. Mr Kershaw said the business \"could not be more contrasting\" to the approach of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi when it was on the way to becoming the world's biggest advertising agency in the 70s and 80s. \"Saatchi &amp; Saatchi set the pattern for those who followed - the bolt-on acquisition model of buying out companies and issuing more paper or debt to fund that,\" he said. \"Every business [M&amp;C Saatchi] has started has been a start-up. It's a very different culture.\" Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's acquisition spree ended in 1995 in an acrimonious break-up. The brothers were ousted and the agency was absorbed into French group Publicis. The brothers then founded M&amp;C Saatchi, which has expanded rapidly, with a turnover of \u00a359.3m and pre-tax profits of \u00a37.5m in 2003. Mr Kershaw said M&amp;C Saatchi's emphasis on incentivising talented staff enabled it to offer its clients a \"brutal simplicity of thought\". \"We can deliver great offices everywhere we go because they will be staffed by highly motivated people, and not just be cogs in a conglomerate machine,\" he said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
