In a rambling televised address late on Friday, Brazil\u2019s embattled president denied claims from his outgoing justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro that he had sought to appoint a new federal police chief in order to gain access to secret intelligence reports \u2013 for reasons that remain murky. \u201cSorry Mr Minister, you won\u2019t make a liar of me,\u201d Bolsonaro declared, flanked by an almost entirely male group of backers, including his politician son Eduardo. Moro\u2019s bombshell allegations sparked pot-banging protests and an immediate outcry among Brazil\u2019s political class, with Brazil\u2019s prosecutor-general Augusto Aras requesting supreme court permission to launch an investigation. \u201cMoro\u2019s testimony \u2026 constitutes strong evidence for an impeachment process,\u201d tweeted Fl\u00e1vio Dino, the leftist governor of the northeastern state of Maranh\u00e3o. Senator Simone Tebet, head of the Senate\u2019s Constitution, Justice and Citizenship committee, tweeted that, if proven, the accusations represented a \u201ccrime of responsibility\u201d \u2013 the same impeachable offence under which leftist president Dilma Rousseff was controversially ousted in 2016. Moro \u2013 who became a hero to conservative Brazilians for jailing the rich and powerful during a sweeping graft investigation called Operation Car Wash \u2013 alleged Bolsonaro had sacked the head of Brazil\u2019s federal police \u2013 its answer to the FBI \u2013 in order to replace him with someone prepared to share secret intelligence reports. \u201cHe wanted someone he had personal contact with, who he could call, gather information from [and] collect intelligence reports from,\u201d Moro said. Amid a looming coronavirus crisis, and just a week after Bolsonaro sacked his popular health minister, the explosive accusations left many wondering how long Bolsonaro\u2019s beleaguered government could survive. \u201cThe president is digging his own grave. He should resign [and] save us from a long impeachment process,\u201d tweeted Brazil\u2019s former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that military officers who form an important bloc in Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet were considering abandoning the government \u2013 a potentially devastating blow for the president, a former army captain. Speculation has been rife over Bolsonaro\u2019s possible motives for replacing Maur\u00edcio Valeixo, the head of the country\u2019s federal police. A report in one major newspaper, the Correio Braziliense, claimed that the move was in part prompted by a federal police investigation into fake news attacks on the Congress and supreme court that was focusing on the president\u2019s own son, Carlos Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro denied those suggestions on Friday afternoon. \u201cThe insinuations that I wanted to know about ongoing investigations are not true,\u201d he said, claiming there was nothing wrong with his wanting to be in regular contact with the new federal police chief. Moro\u2019s exit has dismayed even Bolsonaro voters, many of whom were already shaken by his dismissive attitude towards the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil now has nearly 53,000 confirmed cases and 3,670 deaths. As a judge, Moro led the \u201cCar Wash\u201d corruption investigation and jailed former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 removing Bolsonaro\u2019s main rival in the 2018 election. Moro has remained popular even when his role in the corruption probe was discredited by leaked documents that suggested he had acted improperly \u2013 claims he denies. Losing such a popular minister is a major blow to Bolsonaro. \u201cBolsonaro faces the most decisive moment in his chaotic first term,\u201d said Diego Escosteguy, editor of political news-site Vortex. But Escosteguy cautioned that Congress would still need to approve any impeachment process \u2013 and was only likely to do so after mass demonstrations, as happened before Rousseff was controversially ousted. \u201cIronically, social distancing is Bolsonaro\u2019s ally right now,\u201d Escosteguy said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
