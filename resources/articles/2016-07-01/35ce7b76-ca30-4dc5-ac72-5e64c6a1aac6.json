Doubts about the target arose after the new home secretary, Amber Rudd, would only say her goal was to bring it down to \u201csustainable levels\u201d. Her refusal to endorse the specific target provides a hint that it may at some point be dropped by May, a former home secretary, despite a promise in the Conservative manifesto to reduce net migration to below 100,000 before 2020. May sparked speculation during the EU referendum campaign that she wanted to distance herself from the target set by Cameron when she failed to mention it in her only campaign speech. She also questioned in a television interview whether it was possible to set a particular time period for the target. Speaking after May\u2019s first cabinet meeting in No 10, Rudd declined to endorse the specific target in a BBC interview despite being asked twice if it still existed. The first time Rudd was asked if she could give \u201ca commitment that you are going to get mass migration down to the tens of thousands in the future?\u201d she replied: \u201cWell, what the prime minister has said is that we must bring migration down to sustainable levels. So that is what is going to be my aim at the moment.\u201d Pressed as to whether the target still existed, she said: \u201cI am going to stick to my comment which is about bringing it down to sustainable levels. That has to be the most important thing for the country.\u201d When the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was later asked whether Rudd\u2019s comments indicated the target was about to be dropped, he said his colleague was \u201centirely right to be careful about committing to numbers\u201d because the government \u201cdoes not want to be in a position where we are disappointing people again\u201d. However, Downing Street played down speculation that the target is about to be ditched, saying: \u201cThe prime minister does see sustainable levels as down to the tens of thousands. \u201cSustainable levels is an approach and a language that has been used repeatedly by the Home Office in the past. The prime minister has used it herself. There isn\u2019t a change,\u201d said PM\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cThe emphasis on \u2018sustainable\u2019 reflects the fact that this is about looking at what is the right level for our country, what communities across the country can cope with, pressure on public services, looking at all these issues,\u201d she added. May has inherited both the target and firm expectations from the voting public that leaving the EU will be able to bring down net migration. The terms for ending freedom of movement are expected to be a central issue in negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the EU as Brussels is likely to argue it goes hand in hand with favourable access to the single market. After her first prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, May will head to Germany for one-to-one talks with chancellor Angela Merkel about Brexit, the trading relationship between the two countries, the migration crisis and Islamist terrorism. This will be followed by talks on Thursday with French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. During both discussions, she is likely to warn that the UK needs time to consult with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as different industries, before triggering formal negotiations to leave the EU. At the opening of the first legal challenge to the process of Brexit on Tuesday, government lawyers confirmed that May will not push the button on article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which initiates the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, before the end of this year. Sources said May will be hoping to establish personal relations with both Merkel and Hollande to pave the way for open and frank discussions in the months ahead, suggesting she expects much work towards Brexit to be done through diplomacy with individual leaders as well as in talks with the EU itself. Before the trip, she said she had chosen to visit Berlin and Paris so soon after assuming office because she was determined to make a success of Brexit. \u201cThese visits will be an opportunity to forge a strong working relationship that we can build upon and which I hope to develop with more leaders across the European Union in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not underestimate the challenge of negotiating our exit from the European Union and I firmly believe that being able to talk frankly and openly about the issues we face will be an important part of a successful negotiation.\u201d Earlier, May revealed she will personally take charge of three new ministerial committees \u2013 on Brexit, the economy and social reform \u2013 to implement her priorities for government. No 10 denied it was a move to keep tight control on the policy areas covered by Boris Johnson, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary. The prime minister told her first cabinet meeting that \u201cpolitics is not a game\u201d and they must get on with the job. \u201cBrexit means Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make a success of it. It will be the responsibility of everyone sitting around the cabinet table to make Brexit work for Britain,\u201d she said ahead of the meeting. \u201cAnd it will also be their duty to deliver success on behalf of everyone in the UK, not just the privileged few. That is why social justice will be at the heart of my government. \u201cSo we will not allow the country to be defined by Brexit; but instead build the education, skills and social mobility to allow everyone to prosper from the opportunities of leaving the EU.\u201d Separately, it emerged that Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem former deputy prime minister, will be returning to frontline politics as his party\u2019s spokesman on the EU. \u201cTheresa May says Brexit means Brexit, but no one actually knows what that means. Will we be in the single market or cut off from it, with all the implications that has for British jobs and our economy?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does it mean for immigration? What about the Brits who live abroad and the Europeans who have made our country their home? How will we cooperate with our neighbours to tackle terrorism, cross-border crime and climate change? \u201cWith no meaningful opposition from the Labour party, no exit plan from the government, Whitehall unprepared for the Brexit negotiations and, above all, Theresa May\u2019s refusal to seek a mandate from the people for what is in effect a new government, there is a real risk that she and her Brexit ministers won\u2019t be subject to the scrutiny and accountability which voters deserve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
