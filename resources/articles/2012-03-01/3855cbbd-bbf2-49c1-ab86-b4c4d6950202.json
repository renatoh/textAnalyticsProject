But as the Paris leg of the autumn 2012 shows began in earnest, designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re of the influential label Balenciaga did just that. Backstage, he explained that the show was inspired by an imaginary company, \"Balenciaga Inc\", with \"different women dressing for different business areas. So we have technicians and a legal department.\" It was an unexpected explanation and not one the casual observer would have drawn from the parade of spongy, boxy jumpers, leopard-print metallic reliefs and intergalactic, retro arcade graphics on the catwalk. But the label isn't known for its literal interpretation of ideas into clothes. It trades on a look that combines fifties couture sensibilities with sci-fi overtones \u2013 an improbable mix but one that defines the brand. The clue to the corporate dressing themes was in the setting. In recent seasons, Balenciaga has chosen to show in the rarified environs of the Crillon hotel or in its own minimally-styled showroom. But guests were instead summoned to an office block in a residential arrondissement and led up to the 27th floor to views of Paris cloaked in mist. At London fashion week, office blocks are the number one venue choice of the hottest designers but Parisian shows usually favour prettier surroundings \u2013 all the more powerful for showing off their fashion heritage. . Naturally it fell short of being too obvious \u2013 Parisian fashion does not favour looking cheesy. On the catwalk the look was rigid and exquisitely tailored. Ghesqui\u00e8re's so-called legal department was not easy to spot \u2013 but it was more likely the portfolio-carrying woman in the spongy tailoring than the worker clad in a metallic, zebra-striped biker jacket. Elsewhere strict, white A-line skirts had something of the clerical about them, while shiny elasticated trousers recalled the unflattering uniforms of cleaning staff. That is, until the sight of Balenciaga-faithful actor Charlotte Gainsbourg wearing them backstage raised them into impossibly cool territory. In recent seasons the brand hasn't had quite the same sway over trends it once had and so it is unlikely that space station worker chic will take hold of the rails in Zara in the coming months. This show emphasised the fact that the Balenciaga brand now stands alone \u2013 intentionally so \u2014 and it plays to a home crowd who will doubtless lap up the sweatshirts and the multi-laced ankle boots. The unspoken rule is that you already know whether you are the right applicant to work at Balenciaga Incorporated, or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
