The Channel island acted after research revealed that fewer than 1,300 islanders - or 2 per cent - can still speak it fluently, and most of those are aged more than 65. The States of Guernsey government also sees it as imperative that written Guern\u00e9siais is archived before it becomes extinct, and has appointed a development officer to ensure the language's survival. Guern\u00e9siais is often referred to, rather disparagingly, as a 'patois', or as Guernsey French. But, say local experts, it is not a cannibalised version of French but a Norman language in its own right. A hundred years ago, most islanders would have spoken Guern\u00e9siais as their first language, alongside passable French and English."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
