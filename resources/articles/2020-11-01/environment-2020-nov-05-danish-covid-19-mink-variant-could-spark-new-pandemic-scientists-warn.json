There\u2019s a risk that this mutated virus is so different from the others that we\u2019d have to put new things in a vaccine and therefore [the mutation] would slam us all in the whole world back to the start,\u201d said Prof K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak, vaccine expert and director of infectious diseases at Denmark\u2019s State Serum Institute (SSI). He added, however, that the world was in a better place than when the Covid-19 outbreak began.\u201cWe know the virus, have measures in place including testing and infection control, and the outbreak will be contained, to the best of our knowledge.\u201d Denmark, the world\u2019s largest mink producer, said on Wednesday that it plans to cull more than 15 million of the animals, due to fears that a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. Announcing the cull, the country\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said 12 people were already infected with the mutated virus and mink are now considered a public health risk, based on advice from the SSI. Prof Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist at the University of Copenhagen, went further, telling the Guardian on Thursday that while Denmarkwas not \u201con the verge of being the next Wuhan\u201d there were risks. \u201cThis variant can develop further, so that it becomes completely resistant, and then a vaccine does not matter. Therefore, we need to take [the mutation] out of the equation. So it\u2019s serious.\u201d In interviews with Danish media, Thomsen advised shutting down northern Denmark due to the risks from mink farms, a task made easier by the Limfjord, which cuts across northern Jutland. Although bridges across the fjord remain open, all restaurants, pubs, cafes and sports activities in the area will close shortly. A Dutch virologist and zoonosis expert, Wim van der Poel, said more research was needed but that even without the mutation, a reservoir of the virus in mink or others of the mustelid family such as badgers and martens was to be avoided. \u201cIt seems the mink-variant mutation is found in the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, but we don\u2019t really know. And we don\u2019t know what kind of vaccine we are going to have. So a lot more research is needed,\u201d said Van der Poel. But even without a mutation, the continuing circulation within mink herds may pose a risk to humans. \u201cWe assume [this] is a risk too in the Netherlands, but our fur farming is being phased out already. There\u2019s no more fur production now after the end of this year,\u201d he said. Van der Poel is currently looking at the effect of Covid-19 spreading to mustelids, a family of carnivorous mammals including weasels, badgers, otters, ferrets, martens and wolverines, among others. \u201c If that happened, then you have a reservoir in our local wildlife, and we could get reinfected before we even get a good quality vaccine.\u201d Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThe idea that the virus mutates in a new species is not surprising as it must adapt to be able to use mink receptors to enter cells and so will modify the spike protein to enable this to happen efficiently. \u201cThe danger is that the mutated virus could then spread back into man and evade any vaccine response which would have been designed to the original, non-mutated version of the spike protein, and not the mink-adapted version. Of course, the mink version may not transmit well to man, so it\u2019s a theoretical risk but Denmark is clearly taking a precautionary stance in aiming to eradicate the mink version so that this possibility is avoided or made much less likely.\u201d Jussi Peura, research director of the Finnish Fur Breeders\u2019 Association and animal geneticist, was more sanguine. He said he understood the worry in Denmark, but felt the decision to carry out a cull might have been too extreme. Instead, he suggested continuing with the control measures that were working in Finland. \u201cRight now we have zero cases in fur farms in Finland. We have a total of about 700 fur farms and of those about 150 are mink, all Covid-19-free so far.\u201d Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.
