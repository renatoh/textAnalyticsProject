My father knew him at the BBC. I'd just come out of Guildford School of Acting and my father mentioned that Martin had left the BBC to start up a 'super channel' - a satellite station. This was in the days when satellite TV was completely new. I wondered if it might be a way to get my equity card . At the time I was sending off my CV to theatres up and down the country and I hadn't thought of going straight to television. So I wrote a letter saying, \"Dear Martin, you know my father, and I wondered if I could come for an audition if you are making any children's programmes.\" I wanted to be a children's TV presenter and actress. Go off and video yourself with kids, he wrote back. They were looking for someone to present a daily kids' show. I called up my old school, King Alfred's, and asked if they'd let me film with the kids. I'd always loved being around youngsters. I played a few games and sent the video in and a week later Martin called. He was a lovely man and offered me my own daily children's programme, which I hosted for one year. Martin gave me that opportunity. He looked after me totally - he sort of held my hand. I was very green and I had a lot to learn. There was just me, a producer and an assistant and we used to put out five hours a week. There was a great buzz - it felt like we were pioneering something new and fresh. We had a great Christmas party. I realised, then, that people in television could really drink. We all got so drunk. But Martin was a lovely, kind man and he is still in TV. I went to his 60th birthday party recently. I always thank him - he enabled me to fulfil my dream. It's vital to chase your dream - don't sit still, waiting for something to happen.
