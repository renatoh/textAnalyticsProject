The new orders will ban visits to specified places, and impose curfews and regular reporting requirements to police and probation, to keep track of those released prisoners considered to be at high risk of striking again. In some cases they could last for the rest of the former prisoner's life and those who breach them could be expected to be sent back to prison. The orders are expected to be the centrepiece of an emergency package Mr Clarke has promised to bring forward in the wake of a cluster of high-profile failures involving the supervision of offenders by the probation service. He promised to act after critical inquiry reports into the murders of a London financier, John Monckton, and 16-year-old Mary-Ann Leneghan. A new case emerged yesterday when it was reported that a triple rapist had murdered a young Polish care worker after persuading the Parole Board that he was a model citizen and to release him after serving 19 years of a life sentence. Clive Hayes, 54, killed Karolina Mikolajewska after being released from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire. The home secretary is believed to be finalising details of the emergency package this weekend but it is expected to include an overhaul of the risk assessment procedures on which decisions are made to release violent and serious offenders from prison. He is also to strengthen the Parole Board by restoring its ability to interview candidates for release in person. Stephen Shaw, the prisons ombudsman, and a chief constable are to be asked to form a new panel that will review cases where serious offenders released from prison commit further offences. But it appears Mr Clarke has not been able to make the new \"indeterminate\" sentence - where prisoners are not given a set term - retrospective for those who were imprisoned before its introduction in April 2004. The new sentence has already proved popular with the courts and has been imposed on more than 400 new prisoners. Instead, the new dangerous prisoners order is to be introduced to enable the Parole Board and the courts to impose conditions on those who are released from prison even if they did not form part of their original sentence. The new orders are expected to be similar to the sex offender orders, which control the movements of paedophiles and others on the sex offenders' register. A further damning inquiry report is expected to be published in two weeks' time. It involves Anthony Rice, who was released on licence after serving 16 years of a life sentence for attempted rape, indecent assault and actual bodily harm. He battered a woman with a brick soon after his release and four months later stabbed and strangled Naomi Bryant, 40, in Winchester. He was supposed to be under the close supervision of the police and probation service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
