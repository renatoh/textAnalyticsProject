More precisely, the authors of a new paper today in Current Biology argue from a series of experiments with food bowls that dogs that show \"separation-related behaviour\" are likely to \"exhibit a 'pessimistic' cognitive bias\". There is serious and domestic humane purpose behind the study, but it nevertheless looks very like one of those pieces of research for which casual language has already provided all the cognitive bias anyone could hope for. An abused book is dog-eared; any chaotic situation is a dog's breakfast; and the sultry, enervating days of summer became the dog days 2,000 years ago, when the Romans called them dies caniculares. Humans have been learning from dogs since the first domestications 15,000 years ago, and one of those lessons is that many dogs seem to feel mournful when their owners are not around. Out of such demonstrations of dependency, no doubt, there arose a dismissive language of analogy: dog-tired, or sick as a dog; doggerel (a word possibly derived from dog-Latin, according to the Oxford Dictionary of Etymology); and dogsbody. Someone who will not share is a dog in the manger. Those we despise become curs, those we reject pariahs, those we dismiss as deranged are simply barking. Language like that would be enough to give anybody a pessimistic cognitive bias. No wonder dogs sometimes feel hounded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
