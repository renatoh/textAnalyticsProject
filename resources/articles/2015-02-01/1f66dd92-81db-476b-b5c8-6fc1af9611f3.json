In a speech at the Brookings Institution that underlined both the vibrancy of his economic critique and his distance from the political mainstream, Sanders, a 73-year-old liberal firebrand who runs as an independent but caucuses with the Senate\u2019s Democrats, said he was giving \u201cserious thought\u201d to mounting a campaign \u2013 though he acknowledged it would be a long shot. \u201cAt a time when the middle class is disappearing, when we have grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality, when climate change threatens not only this country but the entire planet, when you have a handful of billionaires in the process of buying the United States government and our political system, I think it is imperative that we have candidates who stand up for the working families of this country who are prepared to take on the big money interest,\u201d he said. Sanders insisted he would only run if he felt there was a realistic chance of winning and did not want to run a \u201cfutile campaign\u201d. \u201cI also understand political realities, and that is when you take on the billionaire class, it ain\u2019t easy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to do it well, we would have to put together the strongest grassroots movement in the modern history of this country, where millions of people are saying, you know what? Enough is enough.\u201d Openly ridiculed by the Washington establishment as someone whose campaign would be quixotic at best, Sanders nonetheless outlined policy ideas that are commonplace in many other wealthy countries \u2013 such as universal healthcare and free access to higher education \u2013 and claimed there was more support for his views than those of most of the potential Republican candidates. He also echoed criticism of economic inequality increasingly made, albeit less forcefully, by a number of more establishment contenders. \u201cToday, the top one-tenth of 1% \u2013 that is the wealthiest 16,000 families \u2013 now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cThe top 25 hedge fund managers made more than $24bn in 2013 which is equivalent to the full salaries of more than 425,000 public schoolteachers. Anyone really think that is morally acceptable, economically acceptable? Is that really what our country should be about?\u201d Sanders, the former mayor of Burlington and the longest-serving independent in Congress, also argued that supreme court decisions to reverse campaign finance limits meant \u201cbillionaire families are now able to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase the candidates of their choice\u201d and oppose economic reform. \u201cThe billionaire class now owns the economy, and they are working day and night to make certain that they own the United States government,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I know that people are not comfortable when I say this, but I want you to take a hard look at what\u2019s going on, take a deep breath, and you tell me whether or not we are looking at a democracy or whether or not we are looking at an oligarchy.\u201d Sanders refused to say whether he would seek the Democratic party nomination or run as an independent but rejected suggestions that he would risk helping Republicans by running as a third-party candidate like Ralph Nader. He also played down fading rumours of a similar challenge to Clinton from like-minded Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI knew Elizabeth Warren before she was Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that Senator Warren is gonna be running for office.\u201d The prospect of an even more radical challenge for the White House from someone seen as an outsider even in the Democratic party led to repeated teasing by EJ Dionne, a Washington Post opinion writer, who hosted the event, but Sanders insisted he remained optimistic that public support was growing. \u201cI think we have the capacity to bring change to this country and we have done it in recent years,\u201d he said, pointing to social progress on race, homosexuality and disability that was once unthinkable. \u201cI think what we\u2019re up against now, by the way, is something tougher, though. Because you are taking on the greed and the power of a billionaire class, of the Koch brothers who are out to destroy social security, Medicare, Medicaid, et cetera, bring us back to the 1920s, and have the money to try to do that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
