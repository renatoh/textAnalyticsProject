The Hillsborough club are \u00a322m in debt to the Co-operative Bank, a figure that is expected to rise significantly following their relegation to League One last season. But despite the risk of another \u00a33m and more being added to the red half of Wednesday's ledger, talks have led to the Co-op pledging to extend credit lines further this year. That flexibility permitted Wednesday to overcome a high court application from HM Revenue &amp; Customs yesterday for the club's winding-up. The Owls faced insolvency proceedings over a low six-figure debt to HMRC but the fresh loan finance from the Co-op allowed them to pay off the taxman and lift the Football League's transfer embargo. The \u00a31m sale of the goalkeeper Lee Grant to Burnley a fortnight ago has permitted Wednesday to cover their other short-term obligations. And with a gate in excess of 23,000 at Hillsborough for the 2-0 win over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on Saturday, along with a 7,390 attendance in the first round of the League Cup against Bury on Tuesday night \u2013 which was higher than many gates at third-tier league fixtures at the weekend \u2013 there are hopes that the year's trading deficit may even shrink. It all goes to prove the old adage: if you owe a bank \u00a322,000 you have a problem; if you owe it \u00a322m the problem is the bank's. Kirdi bid profits owners Liverpool's vendors would be wise to investigate every last detail and more of Yahya Kirdi's proposal to take over the club before deciding on its viability. Kirdi's outline bid is said, inexplicably, to have made provision for a huge sum \u2013 possibly in the region of $600m \u2013 to be paid to the owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett. With no one else willing to pay any consideration for the equity, that has been dismissed by insiders in the sale process as nonsensical. However, if the sellers, led by the investment bank BarCap and the club chairman, Martin Broughton, should rule out his offer, such a decision would leave them vulnerable to litigation from the Americans. Hicks and Gillett could claim there had been material impact on their financial interests and seek to recover damages through the courts. For now, though, Broughton and BarCap have no decision to make. Like every other \"bidder\", Kirdi has still not provided proof of funds. Shirt size unclear After committing about \u00a390m of his company's money over four years to becoming Manchester United's shirt sponsor, Aon's chief executive, Greg Case, has told investors what it is all about. \"Speaking about that world famous shirt, more than 6m Manchester United shirts are sold in a year, giving Aon more than 6m 'walking billboards' annually,\" he said. Well, hats off to the United blogger, Andersred, for challenging that number. Four years ago the club announced it had sold 6m in total between 2000 and 2004, so that 300% increase in shirts shifted annually seems a little improbable. Andersred called Nike's press office (and got through \u2013 unlike Digger) and was told that annual sales are \"significantly below\" 6m. Easy mistake to make. Fifa's Russia trip in doubt Wildfires sweeping Russia could not have come at a worse time \u2013 or in worse locations \u2013 for its 2018 World Cup bid. Russia, viewed as England's biggest rival to host the tournament, is due to accommodate Fifa executive committee members for a four-day technical inspection from Monday. But with fires raging around the capital, Russia's bid could not guarantee yesterday that the visit will even go ahead. \"Russia is keen to convince Fifa it is capable of coping with extraordinary situations,\" a bid spokesman said yesterday. Three of the 13 proposed host cities \u2013 Kazan, Saransk and Nizhny Novgorod \u2013 are in the heart of the crisis regions although none would feature in Fifa's visit. But ex-co members should count themselves lucky. Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister, has of course \"put out two wildfires\" himself, according to the Russian press, and he will be with them if they make it to Moscow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
