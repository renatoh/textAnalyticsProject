Now, like Michael Heseltine, I am finding my own loyalty to the Conservative party tested as never before. I don't believe William Hague is a racist, a xenophobe or an extremist. But why should I pro-actively go out and vote for someone whose agenda appears to be entirely negative? The Daily Telegraph entitled a front page story on Hague's most recent speech \"A pledge to preserve Britishness\". It seemed designed to suggest that British culture is on the point of extinction, but that brave little William was promising a fight to keep it alive, an infinitely depressing prospect. I don't believe Britishness is about to die out - after all, we are not sinking beneath the waves even if we don't rule them any more - but if there are those at Tory central office who think otherwise I have to ask: a) what do they think constitutes \"Britishness\"; and b) how are they going to preserve it? Are red-haired, kilt wearing Scots going to be herded into reservations for Americans tourists to photograph? Shall children be raised to mirror the attitudes and fashion sense of the gerontocracy that form the majority of Conservative party members? Reading on I discovered that, happily enough, the speech did not advocate the institution of compulsory Morris dancing courses for those wishing to renew their passports. Rather Mr Hague was promising that the Conservatives are going to stand up against the dual threat of mass immigration and a European superstate. \"Well, there's news,\" I thought. These are almost the only policies the Conservatives have loudly and clearly offered the voters for some time. But it just isn't good enough. I do not see myself as a brave little Tommy, standing in a ragged square of pink-faced men at Dover, holding out against fiendish frogs or fuzzy wuzzies. I'd rather be a conqueror than a defender. I'd rather be one of the tough ladies who built and ran an empire than be in little Willie's last stand, thank you very much. Unfortunately the current Conservative party offers no obvious channel for courage, curiosity, or generosity. On the contrary it seems to be dominated by a bullying right wing that is, for all its loud mouthed swagger, utterly wet in its whingeing, whining fearfulness. The French, or the Italians, or someone in Europe is always getting at them, always making them blubber. I'm sick of it. \"Why don't you just get over yourselves and do something useful, you bunch of cry-babies,\" I feel like shouting. \"Go on. You didn't see Sir Walter Ralegh sobbing about fishing quotas, did you? Do something.\" But I know they won't. We hear nothing of what they will do in Europe unless it is retreat, retreat, and retreat to some glorious failure. Then there is immigration: I'm sorry but I am not about to be scared of a few Norman Tebbit fans, who have got on their metaphorical bikes and left their homes in search of a better life. We have our own poor to support, our own children to educate, our own elderly to care for and this is where our resources should be concentrated. But while the flood, tidal wave, or mere spate of people can and should be stemmed as William Hague wishes, such a policy doesn't have to sound like a last ditch stand against the forces of darkness. It could, for example, be linked it to a greater and more public effort to encourage political and economic stability in those countries people are anxious to leave. For every Tory who sees economic migrants as hairy-legged thieves poised to break into their suburban semis in Sunningdale, there are two who admire the spirit of men and women battling to better their lot. We'd like to help in a way that will not hold us a hostage to fortune. Mr Hague's speech also mentioned crime and tax. There doesn't seem to be a great deal here to separate the Conservative party from Labour. But the constant reiteration of the threat of crime doesn't necessarily make people feel they would be safer under the Conservatives. It could, in fact make people feel threatened. Conservative tax cuts, have, meanwhile, become associated in the public mind with cuts in services. There is no point in complaining that this isn't fair. The Tories would, instead, do better to describe themselves through a predominantly positive agenda while mounting a ferocious negative campaign against the Labour party in general and Tony Blair in particular. Politics has always been about why people should vote for X and not the next man. There are plenty of reasons not to vote Labour or Mr Blair. His backbenchers represent a petty, vindictive Britain while the prime minister is not merely untruthful but a fantasist. When I vote it will be a mark against them, more than it is for the current Conservative party. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
