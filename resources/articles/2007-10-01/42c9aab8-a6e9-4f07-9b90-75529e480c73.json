Harry Patch, 109, from Wells, was guest of honour at Weston-super-Mare where the signal of a cannon launched the start of commemorations in Somerset. Speaking at the county's Legion House, a convalescence home for ex-service personnel, below, he said: 'Today is not for me, it is for the countless millions who did not come home with their lives intact. They are the heroes. It is also important we remember those who lost their lives on both sides.' Weeks after he was called up for service in 1917, he took part in the battle of Passchendaele, near Ypres."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
