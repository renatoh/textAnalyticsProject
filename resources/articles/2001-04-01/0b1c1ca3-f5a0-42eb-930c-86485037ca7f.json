Impassioned letters to Onegin: 1. Ohmigod - have just sat up all night pouring out feelings for Onegin on paper. Now will think am silly provincial peasant who will never find husband. Maybe should have just left message on answerphone.\" Admittedly the above doesn't entirely do justice to the subtle play of irony and observation in Pushkin's poem, but then nor do the clodhopping couplets of David Lloyd-Jones's dutiful but dull translation. Onegin remains an opera so perfectly clothed in its own milieu, era and metrics that any attempt to dress it in foreign garb creates a slightly ludicrous impression. Onegin is a delicate work that needs handling with care. Tchaikovsky himself was so anxious about this point that he preferred the piece to be premiered by students rather than mangled by the wooden work practices of the professional opera. Dalia Ibelhauptaite's Opera North production was hampered by some slightly incongruous casting two years ago but, having been revived with the breath of youth, it now captures something of the unfettered freshness Tchaikovsky was aiming for. Best of all, Giselle Allen's Tatyana could mark the arrival of a star. To make your debut with a major company in this immensely difficult role is remarkable; that Allen's intensely credible portrayal of Tatyana as a youthful, rosy ingenue seems to have sprung fully formed from nowhere is astonishing. We are used to bigger voices, and much older women, in the role, but Allen's negotiation of the 20-minute solo of the letter scene is truly fearless. This is not only due to the fluid ease with which she unwinds skeins of silkily focused tone, but also to her uninhibited response to the request to roll around rhapsodically on the floor in nothing but a precariously wound bedsheet. William Dazeley, in superb voice, is an actor well up to the task of suggesting that the surly object of this dreamy, proto-Bridget Jones's emotional fantasies is more than a desiccated cad. If Iain Paton seems slightly more inhibited as Lensky, he produces a fine burnished sound, and his farewell to life on a frozen Russian pond is a highlight. Richard Farnes conducts idiomatically with a fine sense of dramatic propulsion. Designer Giles Cadle's juxtapositions of blond wood and cool zinc blues have more to do with the tasteful restraint of a Swedish furniture shop than the salons of St Petersburg, but Sue Wilmington's costumes are a period delight, while the look and sound of the entire company is a delight, period.
