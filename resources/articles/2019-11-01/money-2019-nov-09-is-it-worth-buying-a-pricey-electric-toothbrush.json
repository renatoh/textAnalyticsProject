I\u2019ve seen electric toothbrushes in Boots and there\u2019s a huge price difference. There are Philips ones for \u00a3299, Oral-Bs for \u00a3140, but other Oral-Bs for \u00a335, and a Colgate for \u00a318. I need to know what\u2019s the difference between all the models particularly as they all look much the same? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
