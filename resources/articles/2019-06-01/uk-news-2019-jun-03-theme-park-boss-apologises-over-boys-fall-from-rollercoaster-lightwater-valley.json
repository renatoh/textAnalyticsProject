The child remains in hospital where his condition is said to be improving after he fell about 5 metres (16ft) from the Twister rollercoaster on Thursday. Ian Cunningham said on Monday that everyone at the theme park near Ripon, North Yorkshire, was completely focused on the welfare of the boy and his family. \u201cEveryone at Lightwater Valley theme park is very pleased to hear that the condition of the young boy who fell from our Twister ride last Thursday is improving,\u201d he said in his first public statement since the incident. \u201cAs a father myself, I can imagine only too well how it must have felt for everyone involved when the incident happened, and in the hours since. Our thoughts and concerns are completely focused on the child and his family at this difficult time. \u201cI would like to say how sorry I am personally for the upset and anxiety that this incident has caused. We are committed to offering our full support to the family.\u201d The Health and Safety Executive has launched an investigation into the incident, which happened as the park was busy with families and children during half-term. Witnesses reported seeing the boy hanging backwards outside one of the Twister\u2019s waltzer-shaped carriages before he plummeted to the ground. There were screams from onlookers as the ride continued to operate for up to 15 seconds after the boy fell, according to a witness. A woman believed to be the boy\u2019s mother was stuck on top of the rollercoaster while others rushed to the child\u2019s aid, the witness added. The boy\u2019s condition was initially reported as non-life threatening, but was changed to critical but stable when doctors found he had injuries not apparent at the scene. A North Yorkshire police spokeswoman said on Sunday that the boy was breathing independently and his condition continued to improve. Cunningham said: \u201cEstablishing the cause of the incident is now in the hands of the authorities \u2013 we are co-operating fully with the Health and Safety Executive investigation that is now under way. \u201cUntil the investigation is complete, it will be too early and inappropriate for us to speculate on any aspect of the incident, or answer any specific questions about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
