Or, to use Bill Emmott's term, there is cause for 'paranoid optimism'. In this book, the editor of the Economist lays out his vision of the new century, based largely on the continuation of the trends that shaped the last. Thus, he concludes that democracy will spread, poor nations will industrialise and the environment, while not necessarily getting any better, may not get any worse. America is a glass half full, its size and power ensuring that everyone else toes the line. As for globalisation, didn't Lennon wish for a world without countries? Bill Emmott does indeed make a convincing case, one that is lucidly argued and attractively packaged. But the reader is still left feeling that the ratio of optimism to paranoia (cynicism or just plain realism) is seriously skewed. An Anatomy of Terror Andrew Sinclair Pan Macmillan \u00a38.99, pp369 'Fanaticism... is easy to spoonfeed to the young. A little learning is the nipple of the militant, when the mother's milk is hatred and revenge.' Such curious redundancies both mark and mar this history of terrorism and by the time Sinclair refers to Robert Graves as 'the brave poet', or to Nineteen Eighty-Four as a 'realistic and futuristic novel', one can only wonder who he imagines his audience to be. Nevertheless, this is an admirably comprehensive study - sweeping rather than detailed. Beginning with the fall of Carthage, Sinclair reels through civilisation's discontents, taking in Boudicca and the Bolsheviks, the Mafia and Che Guevara before arriving finally at al-Qaeda. Here, however, the author abandons completely his impartial stance: 'Arabic fundamentalism can only be destroyed by Western materialism... at the end of the day, most people would rather live well than believe what they are taught.' Rocket Dreams Marina Benjamin Vintage \u00a37.99, pp277 Early in her book, Marina Benjamin travels to Florida's Space Coast, the now-derelict base for NASA's golden age. But while the rockets themselves are rusting, the dreams they inspired have found new life elsewhere. Her approachable, if rambling, cultural study looks at the ideological spin-offs of the gleaming optimism of Apollo. Her main argument is that actual space - empty, silent and intimidating - has been supplanted by cyberspace: responsive, communal and creative. This, in turn, has empowered an interactive vision of the stars, explored virtually by millions of home computers. Benjamin raises more ideas and connections than she has space to deal with, and makes some tenuous connections, but her wide scope is backed by strong research and engaging writing.
