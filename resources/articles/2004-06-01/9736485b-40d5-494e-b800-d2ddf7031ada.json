Green will contact three heavyweight American investment institutions - Brandes, Capita and Artisan - which together speak for about 20 per cent of M&amp;S's equity. If they tell him that they back M&amp;S's new management under Stuart Rose, Green will almost certainly back off and wait between six months and a year to see if Rose can turn the company around. If Rose fails, Green will return to the fray, according to City sources. Green will make contact with the Americans via a series of crucial telephone conference calls on Tuesday or Wednesday. If the response from across the pond is cool, he could announce that he is withdrawing his proposals by Friday. It is understood some of his financial backers are getting nervous about overbidding, but the critical factor is whether Green can persuade enough investors to support a bid in excess of 370p. British shareholders are reluctant to accept less than 400p. But many hedge funds have 'shorted' the stock be cause they believe Green's bid will fail and M&amp;S's share price will plunge. But if Green gets a favourable reception from the Americans, he could return with a revised \u00a38.8 billion cash bid, pitched at between 385p and 390p a share, say analysts. That could be enough to persuade M&amp;S to allow Green to inspect its books before he tables a formal offer. Last week, Green offered 'not less' than 370p a share in cash, or a mixture of cash and shares in his investment vehicle, Revival. But Rose, in con sultation with the board and the company's financial advisers - Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Cazenove - rejected the offer as 'significantly undervaluing the group and its prospects'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
