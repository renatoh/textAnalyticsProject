An investigation called it 'reasonable'", "bodyText": "The California police officers who killed Willie McCoy, a 20-year-old who had been sleeping in his car, fired 55 bullets at him in 3.5 seconds \u2013 which was \u201creasonable\u201d, according to the city of Vallejo\u2019s hired consultant. Officials disclosed the extraordinary number of rounds in a report released this week, months after six policemen shot the aspiring rapper who had fallen asleep inside his car at a Taco Bell. The 9 February killing, which McCoy\u2019s family has called an \u201cexecution by a firing squad\u201d, sparked national outrage and has led to intense scrutiny of the Vallejo police department\u2019s frequent use of deadly force and history of misconduct and abuse cases. The 51-page report by David Blake, a paid \u201cexpert\u201d and retired officer, concluded that the killing was \u201cin line with contemporary training and police practices associated with use of deadly force\u201d. He said \u201cthe 55 rounds fired by 6 officers in ~3.5 seconds is reasonable based upon my training and experience as a range instructor as well as through applied human factors psychology\u201d. Relatives of McCoy, a beloved Bay Area rapper whose career was on the rise at the time of his death, said they learned of the bullet count in news reports. \u201cWhat it says is there was never any real intention of trying to work out this situation to where my brother\u2019s life would still be intact,\u201d Marc McCoy, Willie\u2019s older brother, told the Guardian on Wednesday, adding that many in the US had become numb to this level of police brutality: \u201cOur community is so used to this type of violence.\u201d The six officers surrounded McCoy\u2019s car with guns drawn after a Taco Bell employee called police to report a man unresponsive in his car in the drive-thru. The police department in the city, 30 miles north-east of San Francisco, has insisted that the officers fired out of \u201cfear for their own safety\u201d, alleging that McCoy had reached for a gun on his lap. But body-camera footage, released after significant public pressure, cast doubts on parts of the police narrative. The videos only showed McCoy moving his hand to scratch his shoulder before officers opened fire. The police did not try to wake him up or announce that they were officers, and his family and their lawyers have said it seemed clear McCoy was not alert or awake when the police all opened fire. Without an official report on the number of rounds, McCoy\u2019s loved ones had previously been forced to rely on their own estimations after viewing his body, which was riddled with bullets in his face, chest, throat, arms and elsewhere, making him unrecognizable. \u201cThis is an unconstitutional level of force,\u201d said Melissa Nold, an attorney for the family, adding that the 55 bullets were another reminder of police strategy that night: \u201cYou want to ensure that this human being does not survive.\u201d The city agreed to pay up to $8,000 for the \u201cexpert report\u201d on \u201chuman factors and use of force\u201d analysis by Blake, according to contract documents obtained by the Vallejo Times-Herald. Blake has a history of authoring similar reports concluding law enforcement killings were reasonable. He was hired as the \u201coutside expert\u201d to investigate the 2018 killing of Stephon Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old Sacramento man killed in his family\u2019s backyard. Those officers claimed they mistook Clark\u2019s cellphone for a gun, and Blake determined the fatal shots were \u201creasonable\u201d. Blake defended the high volume of bullets fired at McCoy by making inferences about the mental state of the officers. He said officers were \u201cgenerally trained to fire until the threat has been neutralized\u201d and that they probably continued to fire due in part to \u201cacute stress\u201d and \u201cchaos caused by the sounds of gunfire, debris, and weapons mounted lights reflecting off the shattered windshield\u201d. \u201cNo officer expended all ammunition prior to stopping firing which indicates a level of self-control,\u201d he wrote. Nold criticized the report, saying, \u201cEach bullet has to be justified,\u201d and adding, of Blake: \u201cHe gets paid to defend police when they shoot people. We know who he is.\u201d Marc McCoy called the report \u201cvery biased\u201d. He noted that the high volume of bullets was particularly unwarranted given that, as the body-camera footage revealed, before shooting, the officers had commented to each other that the firearm in the car did not have a magazine in it. They noted that if it were loaded, it would only have a single bullet in it. The footage, which showed McCoy asleep for several minutes as officers pointed guns at his head, also captured a policeman saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to pull him out and snatch his ass,\u201d and the officers appearing to make a plan to fire at him, with one saying: \u201cIf he reaches for it, you know what to do.\u201d Marc McCoy said anyone who watched the videos and learned details of the case would conclude the police actions were illegal and unjust. But under US laws, he said, police typically got away with this conduct: \u201cCases like this all need more attention \u2026 We\u2019re going to have more people getting killed unnecessarily.\u201d One officer who fired at McCoy had previously shot and killed an unarmed man, and another was sued by the family of a teenager for police brutality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
