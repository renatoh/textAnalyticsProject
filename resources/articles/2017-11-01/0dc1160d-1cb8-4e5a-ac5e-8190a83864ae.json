The question of whether or not the LNP would accept One Nation\u2019s support to form government has dogged Nicholls\u2019 attempts to rebrand both himself, and the party, in the wake of the Newman government. In an increasingly fraught election campaign, which is approaching its final week, Labor has seized on the LNP decision to directly preference One Nation ahead of Labor in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as proof a deal has been done between the two parties. Standing in front of an audience of 100 undecided voters, chosen by Galaxy polling for the leaders\u2019s debate in Brisbane hosted by Sky News and News Corp, Nicholls was repeatedly asked whether he would take One Nation\u2019s support to form government and was heckled for failing to give a straight answer. \u201cWell, we\u2019re in this contest to win it. No team goes on to...\u201d \u201cYes or no,\u201d the audience, including Palaszczuk, began to shout. \u201cNo team goes on to the field.....\u201d he tried again, before he was cut off again by forum host David Speers. \u201cThere are plenty of people here saying yes or no Tim Nicholls, it is a straight forward question.\u201d \u201cNo team goes out onto the field,\u201d Nicholls repeated, before he was once again cut off. \u201cVoters at this point, with nine days to go, probably deserve to know would you be willing to take the support of One Nation,\u201d Speers said. \u201cI have said very clearly,\u201d Nicholls said, \u201cno deals, no coalition, no shared ministry and we will deal with the parliament and the elected representatives that the people put forward.\u201d Asked if that meant he would form government with \u201cthe supply and confidence of One Nation\u201d, Nicholls, prevaricated once more. \u201cI am looking to ask the people of Queensland, to say if you want a team that is unified or solid and will act in the best interests of Queensland, please support the LNP and I will deal with the outcome of the election once that is known, I am not going to deal with the hypothetical or what not.\u201d Audience members once again began to shout \u201cyes or no\u201d, and, when asked one more time, \u201cwould you be willing to accept the support of One Nation if you need it for supply and confidence\u201d, Nicholls fell back on a practised answer. \u201cI will deal with parliament, that Queenslanders ...\u201d he said, before being cut off by laughter and jeers from at least half of the audience. The preference decision helped Labor to reset its message after a week and a half of missteps, mostly centred around Palaszczuk\u2019s announcement she would veto any Naif funding for Adani. Labor uses every opportunity it has to talk about the \u201cchaos\u201d a One Nation balance of power would create and when asked if Labor would do a deal with One Nation, Palaszczuk\u2019s direct answer earned her one of the biggest cheers of the night. \u201cUh no,\u201d she said, prompting audience applause. \u201cYou have to stand on your principles, and I will stand on my principles and if that means going into opposition, we\u2019ll go into opposition, because I don\u2019t want to see the chaos and confusion that will come with having these two former cabinet ministers ... forming an alliance, a coalition that will be an embarrassment not just to Queensland, not just to our nation, but to the rest of the world. It would undo all of the good things we have been trying to do to work together. \u201cThey don\u2019t agree on policies. How is it going to work?\u201d Queensland\u2019s One Nation leader, Steve Dickson, a former minister in the Newman government, said Palaszczuk\u2019s answer meant she did not want to deal with 20% of the Queensland population which was planning on voting for his party. \u201cI am happy to work with both of these people for the benefit of Queensland,\u201d he said. Energy, public transport and a lack of positivity in politics, with more than one plea for politicians to work together from voters earning applause, were also canvassed. At one point, asked who wanted Adani to receive the $1bn loan for the train line, not a single audience member raised their hand. But at the end of the night, it was the One Nation question which loomed large. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on board with Labor before tonight, but I am onboard now,\u201d said Lyn, one of the chosen undecided voters, who declined to give her surname. \u201cThe fact that Mr Nicholls didn\u2019t answer and wasn\u2019t straightforward with his questions \u2013 that he was just waiting to see what the result was to see how he responds \u2013 that wasn\u2019t good enough for me. It\u2019s a yes or no answer, and the crowd sort of felt that way too. He led us to believe he was going to change his mind if it didn\u2019t go his way at the end. I didn\u2019t like that.\u201d The majority of the audience appeared to feel the same way, with 60% declaring Palaszczuk won the debate, with 12% siding with Nicholls and 10% choosing Dickson. The last 18% remained undecided."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
