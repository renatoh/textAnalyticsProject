Shahbzada Muhammed Imran, 27, and Ahmedin Sayed Khyel, 35, were dumped on an isolated stretch of New Lane in Tong on Tuesday night. Both had suffered serious head injuries. The women, aged 63 and 26, we arrested at an address on Bradford's Leeds Road. Forensic teams were working at a separate address in the city. A vehicle believed to be linked to the deaths has also been recovered. Police say the bodies of Imran, from Bradford and Khyel, from London, were discovered by a passing motorist shortly after 10pm on Tuesday. No weapons were found, leading police to suspect they were attacked elsewhere and then moved. Results of a postmortem examination on the body of one of the men showed he died from the injuries sustained to his head. Tests were still being carried out on the second body on Friday. A West Yorkshire police spokesman said the victims had been seen leaving an address on foot earlier in the evening . \"I am appealing for anyone who saw the men in the area at this time to contact us so that we can piece together their movements in the period before their deaths,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
