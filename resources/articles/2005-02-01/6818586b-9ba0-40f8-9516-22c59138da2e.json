Wenger regards Bergkamp as effectively irreplaceable but does not want to \"spoil\" the end of the Dutchman's Arsenal career by allowing him to continue if he is in decline, even though Bergkamp is keen to remain for Arsenal's final year at Highbury. He will delay his decision on the striker's future until late May, when the former Ajax forward's existing deal expires. Bergkamp is keen to stay for Arsenal's Highbury swansong and the manager said: \"There is no question that if he is playing like this at the end of the season he will carry on.\" Bergkamp was excellent as Arsenal overwhelmed Crystal Palace 5-1 on Monday and has been in fine form, scoring three goals in four Premiership matches, providing numerous decisive passes and showing his enduring big-game quality at home to Manchester United, even though the team lost. Wenger will not commit to giving Bergkamp an extension now because it goes against his policy of waiting until the end of a season to discuss contracts with players over a certain age. \"We don't change our attitude after every good game because we could change it after a bad game as well,\" he said. But Wenger acknowledged that it would suit all parties if Bergkamp performed well enough to earn another one-year deal and played an 11th season at Arsenal. \"You simply cannot find a player to replace Dennis because players of that quality are non-existent at the moment,\" he said. Wenger made it clear, though, that he would not give Bergkamp a contract if he felt the player was on the wane. \"He wants to play on for as long as possible, which I understand,\" Wenger said, \"but also what you have to respect is that we don't spoil the end of his career. He has done so well for us over the years that I want to make sure he is remembered as a true legend here.\" Bergkamp, who will not travel to Tuesday's Champions League game at Bayern Munich, is scarcely showing his age and Wenger sees no reason to be concerned about the Dutchman's condition. He called Bergkamp an example to youngsters. \"You never see him drinking, you never see him out and, between 30 and 37, that will make a huge difference,\" Wenger said. \"He will be 36 in May. To play up front at that age, you don't find that. I think he gets rewarded for the quality of his life.\" Thierry Henry welcomes Bergkamp's desire to continue. \"Thank God for that,\" he said. \"You can talk about him all night, the way he plays, the way he sets up people, the way he sees the game. The thing I love about Dennis is that he can beat a team with just one pass. He sees things that other people can't see.\" Henry also paid tribute to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes. The Spaniard was tricked last week into admitting he was unhappy at Highbury and wanted a move to Real Madrid but Henry called his performance against Palace \"amazing\". Edu has also left a decision about his future until the summer, giving the club fresh hope that he may yet stay with Arsenal although he and the club have been far apart on contract talks. \"I haven't signed anything with anyone,\" the Brazil midfielder said last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
