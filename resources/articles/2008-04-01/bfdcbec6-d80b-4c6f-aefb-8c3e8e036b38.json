After so much controversy the Rawalpindi Express has been punished for the relatively minor offence of criticising his board after missing out on a central contract. Shoaib says he will fight the ban in court but the Pakistan board has clearly lost patience with the 32-year-old. \"It's a sad day for me and for Shoaib Akhtar because he was such a talented player,\" said the PCB chairman, Nasim Ashraf. \"We felt that his presence in the field was damaging to the team and the image of Pakistan cricket. He will not be able to play for Pakistan or in Pakistan.\" Shoaib responded by saying: \"I will go to court if I have to, and fight this ban. I have always given 100% for the national team. How can they accuse me of being a damaging influence? I bowled with a high fever during the recent Test series in India. I did it for the team. Nothing is more important than playing for Pakistan.\" Shoaib's list of \"previous\" dates back to 1999 when he was called for throwing, something repeated two years later. In 2002 he was banned for throwing a bottle into the crowd and reprimanded for ball tampering. The first big threat to his career came two years ago after a positive test for nandrolone. However, the two-year ban was quashed and he was acquitted on appeal when the board ruled he had not knowingly taken the substance. Last season Shoaib was sent home from the Twenty20 World Cup, fined US$52,000 (\u00a326,300), banned for 13 international matches and put on probation for two years after hitting his team-mate Mohammad Asif with a bat. The severity of yesterday's punishment, imposed after a hearing in Rawalpindi and including a fine of 3.4m rupees (\u00a343,000), indicates that this time there will be no way back as far as Pakistan is concerned. Danish Kaneria, charged with a similar offence, got off with a reprimand and a warning. However, it is not the end of Shoaib's playing days as he is free to join Calcutta in the Indian Premier League - where he can earn US$425,000 a season - and yesterday Imran Khan came out to support him. \"This ban is totally unacceptable,\" the former Pakistan captain said. \"It literally ends his career. The board is destroying Pakistan cricket by banning players. A fine would have been fine for Shoaib. He has not committed a crime. The board must keep in mind that we also need to win matches and keep our pride.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
