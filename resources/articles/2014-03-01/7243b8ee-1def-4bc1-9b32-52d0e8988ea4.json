The 67-year-old will replace incumbent Louis van Gaal after this summer's World Cup in Brazil, with the former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy lined up to work as one of his assistants, according to Voetbal International. Hiddink, who has been working alongside Phillip Cocu at PSV Eindhoven this season, revealed last month that he was in talks over succeeding Van Gaal after the World Cup having left his last permanent job at Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala in July 2013. His appointment is now expected to be confirmed later this week, with current assistant and former Ajax captain Danny Blind set to continue in his post. Reports in the Netherlands also suggested that former United defender Jaap Stam had turned down the chance to join Hiddink's backroom team, with FC Utrecht manager Jan Wouters also ruling himself out. Hiddink \u2013 who won the European Cup with PSV in 1988 \u2013 spent three years in charge of the Netherlands in the 1990s, reaching the World Cup semi-finals at France 98. He went on to have spells at Real Madrid, Australia and South Korea, who he also took the last four of the World Cup in 2002. Hiddink will be expected to qualify for Euro 2016 from a group including Czech Republic, Turkey, Latvia, Iceland and Kazakhstan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
