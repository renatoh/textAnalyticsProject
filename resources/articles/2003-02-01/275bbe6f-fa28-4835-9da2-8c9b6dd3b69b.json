However there remains a possibility that the match could yet be played - perhaps in South Africa - later on in the tournament. \"The ECB has told us they will not play match in Harare on Thursday,\" ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed told a highly-charged press conference in Cape Town this afternoon. \"The ECB cited safety concerns for the players as their reason for not fulfilling that commitment.\" Outlining how the decision had been made, Speed added: \"The ICC gave a direction to the ECB to comply and play the match in Zimbabwe, but the ECB said that it does not believe that direction is reasonable. \"Accordingly the ICC has moved to cancel the match which is scheduled for Thursday. The ICC is disappointed that the match will not go ahead.\" The ECB are still hopeful that the game might be played elsewhere at a later date - and have asked the ICC's technical committee to consider new evidence of security problems which have come to light since their appeal to Justice Sachs failed last week. However Speed was not conclusive. \"The ECB has asked the ICC to consider relocating the match to a venue outside Zimbabwe at a later date,\" he said. \"That process won't be something that will be resolved today. \"I certainly would not assume that the match will be relocated.\" The ECB responded at a separate press conference, with chairman David Morgan insisting - to audible gasps - that: \"This has not been a sordid squabble about money.\" \"We are concerned for the cricket fraternity in Zimbabwe and particularly those who would have been spectators at the match on the 13th,\" he continued. \"Throughout this process we have been trying desperately to keep the world of cricket united and are mindful of our responsibility in this regard. \"Although this process been lengthy we have not dithered or been guilty of procrastination.\" For several weeks now England's players have been worried about security and social unrest in Zimbabwe, but news of death threats over the weekend racheted up concerns. With one organisation - the Sons and Daughters of Zimbabwe - warning them: \"Come to Harare and you will die\", the reluctance of Nasser Hussain's men to fulfil Thursday's fixture has grown more apparent by the day. Now that the ECB have decided to boycott Zimbabwe, the implications could be far-reaching. England have sacrificed what little goodwill they had left going into the tournament, face the potential for huge legal costs, and also risk the disruption of next summer's Test programme and the loss of influence on the ICC board. Earlier today, South Africa's top cricket chief Percy Sonn warned England that pulling out of their match against Zimbabwe would be considered a \"major snub\". \"It is our tournament and they are obliged to follow their commitments, so if they do pull out, they will snub us as hosts of the tournament, and we will definitely have to look at that,\" he warned. Sonn, president of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, also insisted that South Africa might have to apply similar standards when considering their scheduled tour of England. \"England talk of security fears (in Zimbabwe) but the ICC and the World Cup organising committee have investigated it and said it is safe,\" said Sonn. \"On the other hand, there are a lot of problems in England - they have found terror cells there with poisonous gas planning attacks and they consider themselves a terror target. \"So we will have to look at their security as well. We will not send our boys into a place we consider to be unsafe for them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
