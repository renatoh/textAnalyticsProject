The Labour leader was repeatedly urged during the meeting, including by his longstanding political friend John McDonnell, to win back disillusioned party members by moving towards a more wholehearted remain stance, according to two people present. But Corbyn\u2019s reference to the former Labour prime minister was regarded as a fresh signal that he is not ready to become a cheerleader for remain. Wilson called the 1975 referendum on common market membership partly when he was presiding over a deeply divided Labour cabinet \u2013 but while the government\u2019s official position was to recommend staying in, he allowed ministers to campaign on both sides. After the meeting, Corbyn\u2019s office released a lengthy statement reiterating Labour\u2019s existing position. According to the released remarks, Corbyn told his colleagues: \u201cI have already made the case, on the media and in Dublin, that it is now right to demand that any deal is put to a public vote. That is in line with our conference policy, which agreed a public vote would be an option.\u201d But he added that, \u201ca ballot paper would need to contain real choices for both leave and remain voters. This will of course depend on parliament. I want to hear your views, I will be hearing trade union views next week, and then I want to set out our views to the public.\u201d Corbyn shifted in the aftermath of the European elections \u2013 with little fanfare \u2013 to supporting a referendum on any deal. But even close allies believe the message is still not clear enough, and the party risks losing voters to the ardently anti-Brexit Lib Dems. One shadow minister loyal to Corbyn said: \u201cHe\u2019s on the move \u2013 just not fast enough\u201d. Shadow ministers were told they would be returning to the issue of Brexit at next Tuesday\u2019s meeting; and keen supporters of a people\u2019s vote said they hoped the statement was just the first step in what one called a \u201cmanaged climbdown\u201d. However, others said they remained concerned that any shift would be too little, too late to win back disgruntled voters. McDonnell has told friends that while he is sympathetic to Corbyn\u2019s desire to continue trying to respect the referendum, and represent both remain and leave, he is concerned about morale among party members. The initial shift to supporting a referendum on any deal \u2013 or on a no-deal \u2013 was made in the wake of Labour\u2019s disastrous showing in the European parliament elections, in which the party polled just 14%. But Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, as well as McDonnell, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, have pressed for Labour to take a more full-throated anti-Brexit position. Watson gave a provocative speech on Monday, saying \u201cour members are remain, our hearts are remain, our values are remain\u201d. Rachael Maskell, of Labour campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, said: \u201cBy late July, we will have an extreme rightwing Tory prime minister, pursuing a hard Brexit that will wreck our communities and undermine our rights. As a party, we need to present a clear alternative to transform Britain and Europe, and we need to be energetic and enthusiastic about promoting it.\u201d Several shadow ministers, including Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, remain sceptical about the necessity for Labour\u2019s position to shift further, however. Earlier, Lavery claimed his Twitter account had been interfered with, after he replied to a tweet from a journalist, suggesting the \u201creal position\u201d of supporters of another Brexit referendum was to revoke article 50. Lavery said the message \u201cwas not authorised by myself or anyone on my team\u201d, and \u201cappropriate security updates have been made\u201d. As the shadow cabinet gathered on Wednesday, 26 Labour MPs wrote to Corbyn, warning him that embracing a second Brexit referendum would be \u201ctoxic to our bedrock voters\u201d. MPs including Stephen Kinnock, Gloria De Piero, Sarah Champion, Jon Cruddas, Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy sent the letter. In the meeting on Wednesday, the Guardian understands MPs received a voting analysis written by party strategists. The document said that it was \u201cnot obvious, from the evidence of local elections and Peterborough, that a more \u2018pro-remain\u2019 position from Labour would in itself win back voters currently lost to the Liberal Democrats, or in a numerical enough way that would offset leave voters in many of the key marginals, that [we] have lost both recently and over the last few general elections\u201d. Though the document said there were target remain seats in and around London, such as Cities of London and Westminster, Putney, Watford and Wimbledon which Labour needed to win, the majority of target and defensive seats were in the Midlands and the north of England and voted leave. \u201cThe recent elections don\u2019t suggest any change to this basic arithmetic, given the geographical distribution of leave and remain voters,\u201d the analysis said. \u201cThere is an evident risk that shifting to a more explicitly pro-remain position would leave us vulnerable in seats we need to hold or win without enough potential seat gains in winnable remain majority areas.\u201d In their letter to Corbyn, the MPs said that Labour was \u201cdevastated in local elections in longstanding Labour-held councils\u201d and that the \u201cstrength of the Brexit party in Labour heartland areas in the European elections revealed a much more potent threat than either the Liberals or the Greens present\u201d. The MPs also pointed to the result of the Peterborough byelection, a seat Labour held with a small majority over Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
