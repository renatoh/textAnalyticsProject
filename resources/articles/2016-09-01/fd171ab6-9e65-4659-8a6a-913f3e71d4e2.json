In fact, the magistrate said Dr Zigmond\u2019s noncompliance was a breach of his contract. A caption and the text said Dr Zigmond did not use computers for his notes; he tells us his notes are both handwritten and computerised. In reporting that in the Philippines 3,526 people had been killed, most in extrajudicial killings by vigilantes, in the crackdown on drugs, we did not intend to convey that they were all drug dealers or addicts. That is alleged, not necessarily proved. (\u201cThe tragic story of the death-row maid caught up in Philippines war on drugs\u201d, News, last week, page 25.) The book Charlie One by Sean Hartnett is published by Merrion Press, not Mercier Press (\u201cBritish army spy reveals hidden role in Ulster war\u201d, News, last week, page 20). The name of Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, was misspelled Ana Colau in \u201cDon\u2019t call us Corbynistas\u201d, New Review, last week, page 6.
