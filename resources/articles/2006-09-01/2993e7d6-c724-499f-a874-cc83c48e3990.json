But the missing piece in the jigsaw remains: what to do with Whitehall and its mandarins? The only debate about how the centre operates has been about the growth of Blair's kitchen cabinet, and the influence of special advisers. The more pressing question, however, is this: is Whitehall \"fit for purpose\"? Our research - which has included in-depth interviews with leading civil servants and ministers - suggests real cause for concern. We found serious problems with its skills base (especially in management and delivery) and its ability to innovate, to think strategically and to learn from mistakes. These weaknesses are not new and have long been recognised, and were recently confirmed by the capability reviews. So why do problems persist, especially given countless attempts to cure them? On our reading, reform efforts have largely failed because they have not got to the root of the problem, which we believe rests with the constitutional conventions that govern the civil service. It is these, after all, that ultimately determine how and why the civil service behaves as it does. We argue that these conventions are anachronistic and severely inadequate. This is particularly true of the most important of them, the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, which holds that ministers alone are accountable for everything that happens in their departments. Developed in pre-democratic times, it now needs recasting to take account of 21st-century government. Times have changed. Whitehall's governing arrangements mean relations between ministers and civil servants are increasingly ill-defined and their roles and responsibilities unclear. As a result, there is a \"governance vacuum\" at the top of Whitehall: lines of accountability are confused and leadership structures are weak. This holds the civil service back and undermines its performance. What, then, should the government be doing? We argue that it needs to recast the doctrine of ministerial responsibility so that mandarins become directly accountable for clearly defined operational matters, with ministers being responsible for policy and resources. This change should be underpinned by a new civil service executive, led by an empowered cabinet secretary, responsible for appointing and line-managing permanent secretaries and capable of rewarding high performers and removing those who don't cut it. Such a body would at last provide Whitehall with the corporate leadership it needs. We recommend replacing the civil service commissioners with a new governing body for the civil service, tasked with setting its strategic direction. These changes would necessitate a change in the relationship between parliament and Whitehall. Mandarins, in gaining a constitutional personality, would be held to account by select committees for these operational duties. Introducing a clearer division of responsibilities between ministers and mandarins and improving the arrangements by which both ministers and officials are held to account would improve government performance. We reject the notion that by dividing accountability you dilute it. It is the present arrangements that undermine effective accountability - letting ministers and officials \"duck and dive\" behind each other. While we recognise that there is no pure and binary distinction between \"policy\" (the realm of ministers) and \"operations\" (the realm of officials) we do not believe complexity should be used as an argument for inertia. An effective dividing line can be drawn, as demonstrated in New Zealand and the experience of local government. Moreover, there is precedent to build on. The \"accounting officer\" principle - whereby permanent secretaries are accountable for financial probity - shows how it is possible to differentiate ministerial and official responsibilities. Most illuminating, however, is the government's decision at the Home Office to introduce a \"contract\" between ministers and officials. It may seem a lot to spend \u00a3322m on government communications, but the debate has covered up the real issue of how to reform Whitehall. The one exception to this came after the latest crisis at the Home Office, which put the civil service in the spotlight. Ministers grasped the importance of a high-performing Whitehall. Let's hope they haven't forgotten this and come back ready to sort things out, not just at the Home Office but across Whitehall. \u00b7 Guy Lodge is a research fellow at the Institute of Public Policy Research. \u00b7 Whitehall's Black Box: Performance and Accountability in the Senior Civil Service, by Guy Lodge and Ben Rogers, is available at www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
