Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we\u2019re not allowed to hug. So here are some answers to the questions that we are increasingly asking. This social distancing thing: how should I walk down the pavement? In the middle? On the left? On the right? Or next to the street so I can get right out of people\u2019s way? If you are on your own, you can walk down the street however you damn please; just keep an eye out for people coming towards you and maintain your distance. Try not to dawdle where the pavement narrows, especially if people might be coming up behind you. If you are walking as a couple, inconvenience yourselves \u2013 walk into the gutter, separate, go round the parked car \u2013 on behalf of anyone else. If you are walking as a family, go in the bubble formation, all members round some central member. You are not going to scatter in a uniform way as someone comes towards you, but they can see you, and if you all stick together, they can react accordingly. \u201cThe protocol,\u201d explains Dr Jane Greatorex, a virologist, microbiologist and senior tutor at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, \u201cis that nobody can breathe the virus on you. Experiments have been done looking at that. But if you are passing too close and an individual coughs on you, then you do stand a chance of being infected.\u201d This is the logic behind the two-metre distance: that someone outside that distance could indeed cough, and that would be OK. \u201cThis is going to sound really stupid,\u201d Greatorex continues, \u201cbut people have to understand how big two metres is. Getting it across to kids in particular: my local Waitrose has a cardboard cutout of J\u00fcrgen Klopp.\u201d (For non-football fans, Klopp is 1.93m tall, or 6ft 4in.) On the other hand, if someone walks past you without observing that two-metre distance, but hasn\u2019t coughed or sneezed, there is no need to scream abuse at them. What should I do if someone gets too close, or looks as if they are about to? Sonia Adesara is a doctor, coming out of self-isolation to join the frontline against Covid-19 this week (I put it so dramatically to indicate that it is our duty to listen to her). \u201cI think the general etiquette if there\u2019s someone working at the till who every two minutes has a person coming close towards their face, try to give them a bit of space, because they\u2019re being put in that situation by their work. But if someone\u2019s jogging past and they\u2019re suddenly within two metres, you need to understand that it\u2019s not life or death. Someone running past you is not going to pass on the virus. It\u2019s more sustained contact than that.\u201d The reason we try to keep distance on public transport is in case of droplets. Is there any point in wearing a face mask? What about a scarf over your mouth and nose? Adesara says that if you are coughing and spluttering, anything that protects other people from droplets will help, although better etiquette is to cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away. Greatorex underlines the distinction between a paper face mask and full PPE equipment: \u201cThe sort of face mask that they\u2019ll be wearing on intensive care wards has to be specially fitted, in order to prevent any virus particle getting on to your face.\u201d It is rarely necessary for people to try to find that protection outside a clinical setting, although a care worker, going house to house, might want to wear a paper mask, because they will \u201cstop a cough going \u2018whoomph\u2019 out of your mouth\u201d (Greatorex). Of course, if you are actively coughing, you shouldn\u2019t be outside at all, or working. So this is really advice for a surprise first cough. Is it safe to touch shop doors? Touchscreens? Your shopping? How can I make it safer? Greatorex explains: \u201cVirus particles have an envelope, the lipid molecule. It will bind to some things really well \u2013 soft fabrics and paper \u2013 and it will die relatively quickly on those. But on hard surfaces \u2013 glass, plastic \u2013 that it won\u2019t bind to, it can stay alive much longer. Stainless steel is a disaster.\u201d Try to avoid touching hard surfaces with your hands altogether, and use an elbow or a shoulder if you can. Where you cannot avoid using your hands \u2013 escalator handrails, shopping trolleys, car doors \u2013 you should first and foremost avoid touching your face, come in the house, wash your hands, then put on plastic gloves and go out and clean the hard surfaces that you will regularly touch, such as your front door. As for food packaging, you are bound to pick it up, so just wipe it when you get home, washing your hands before and after. What about deliveries? Are they safe to take into the house at once? \u201cThe outside packaging is the only thing that\u2019s really going to be a danger to you,\u201d Greatorex says. \u201cTreat everything from outside with a degree of caution, because someone\u2019s packaged it.\u201d What is the best way to wash any food I get to make sure it\u2019s germ-free? Greatorex says: \u201cFactory production lines, your Tesco ready meal, that\u2019ll be as clean as a whistle. It will all have been done in a sterile environment. Fruit and vegetables, likewise, will mostly have been sorted by machines. I\u2019d still wash an apple in soap and water, especially if it was from a farm shop.\u201d Wait: she would wash an apple with soap? \u201cWell, I am a microbiologist.\u201d You should treat all food with a degree of caution unless you have grown it yourself. If you think that is ridiculous, remember the salmonella outbreak that came from strawberries, or the infections you can get from bagged salad. Should I be regularly disinfecting my bank card, my phone etc? You should wipe your phone down with a cloth and disinfectant twice a day. If you have mostly used contactless payment, your bank cards should be OK. Most people seem to have given up using cash, not so much for the potential for infection from the cash itself \u2013 although the virus can survive better on polymer notes than on paper \u2013 but because you don\u2019t really want to be handing things to anyone. Should I wear gloves in the supermarket \u2013 and are woolly ones at all effective if I don\u2019t have latex gloves? Woolly gloves are worse than pointless. They trap the virus, so you still have to wash them regularly \u2013 and hands are easier to wash. I have been out to exercise once and didn\u2019t see a single person. Does this really have to count as my one piece of exercise? Is it OK to go out again? This is all about messaging: if you went out once and saw nobody, of course you haven\u2019t infected anyone. But people who live in built-up areas are going to find it impossible to get that level of isolation, and it will be corrosive to harmony if we say the strictest rules are only for people who live in tower blocks. What we are trying to avoid is the measures becoming any more stringent: in France and Germany, you are not allowed more than a fixed number of metres from your front door. And that will involve abiding by rules for which there seem to be scant microbiological foundation. What is an essential journey? Shopping for food or medicine, exercise, feeding animals and looking after other people who are self-isolating. Especially if they are cocooning for 12 weeks, waving at them through a window counts as essential, so long as you combine it with something else they actually need. If you are going stir-crazy, the best thing you can do is join your local volunteer group, which always has essential errands. How long should I carry on paying my childminder, cleaner etc if I cannot use them? This is not a medical question as such, but over to Adesara: \u201cYou should pay everyone you normally employ for as long as you can afford to. You have to think about what other people\u2019s situations are: you may not be using their services, but that person also needs to feed themselves and their families.\u201d It it OK to meet up with people who live close by if I keep two metres away? As long as you maintain your distance \u2013 Greatorex still talks to her neighbours over the fence. If you see someone you know when you\u2019re taking your essential exercise, of course you can say hello. Can I let my dogs and cats socialise with others? Can they pass on coronavirus? There have been reports of two dogs having caught the virus from their owners, but there is no evidence of animals being able to pass it on, so it is still OK, in a park, to let your dogs frolic so long as you do not get too close to the owners. Good luck stopping your cat from socialising. How do I tell someone they are not behaving safely? Ask yourself first whether or not you are enjoying playing the world\u2019s police officer a little bit too much. Delivery drivers and other essential workers report having been harassed in the street for being out, when they are on their way to work. It is much easier for some people to self-isolate than it is for others, and consider before you judge someone else\u2019s behaviour the possibility that their situation is more complicated than you appreciate. There are very few circumstances in which upbraiding someone will be more effective for your safety than simply moving a bit further away from them. Adesara is unnerved by how much the police are relishing their new powers: \u201cOne force\u2019s social media feed was shaming someone the other day for walking her dog in high heels. But there is really nothing dangerous about walking your dog in heels.\u201d Do I need to wash my clothes and have a shower as soon as I get in after I have been outside even if I have not touched anything? This somewhat depends what being outside entailed. Greatorex\u2019s sister works in a supermarket, where she interacts with a large number of people, and changes into fresh clothes at the end of work, brings her uniform home in a bag and puts it straight in the washing machine (having first washed her hands). Other people in similar high-contact jobs \u2013 teachers who are still working, for instance \u2013 have been advised to keep a bin bag at their front door and their washing machine open, then strip as soon as they walk in, put all their clothes in the bag, have a shower, then wash the clothes. If you are just going out to make an essential journey, make sure you have a jumper or coat that you wear only outdoors. Do I need to wash my hands all the time and not touch my face even if I haven\u2019t been out of the house for a week? \u201cIf you never see anybody, no. Even if there was once virus on any of your surfaces, it will die off and you\u2019ll be surrounded by dead virus,\u201d Greatorex reassures us. How do I stop myself eating all the lockdown snacks? People seem to go one of two ways, either eating everything they can see, or losing their appetites with anxiety. It is actually better to be eating all the snacks, because at least it will cheer you up. You could do elaborate menu plans and try to stick to three meals a day. Or you could just give yourself a break. I got so bored the other day, I taught my dog to back away from cheese. I put it on Twitter, and someone said: \u201cThat\u2019s great \u2013 can you teach me?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2020.
