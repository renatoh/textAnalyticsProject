On the floor, the prisoner\u2019s simple possessions \u2013 a jar, some clothes or towels, perhaps a razor \u2013 are neatly stacked in a little burst of yellow, red, purple, orange, blue. Nelson Mandela\u2019s memory of his cell on Robben Island in this lithographic print is very different from the way the cell is presented to visitors to the island itself, where grey felt blankets and a tin cup grimly decorate the preserved room. In Mandela\u2019s drawing, the colours are vibrant, as if he wants to remember what made prison bearable, not what made it unbearable. In 2002 Mandela attempted to record his feelings about Robben Island in this and four other limited edition, individually signed prints. But his art has now become entangled in controversy. This week, London\u2019s Belgravia Gallery opens an exhibition of Mandela\u2019s lithographs \u2013 apparently against his wishes. He \u201cstrongly dissociates himself\u201d from the event; his lawyer insists, \u201cHe did not sign those artworks.\u201d The gallery claims its video of him signing artworks proves its sale authentic. This is the latest twist in a painful story. Mandela created the images to raise money for his charities for homeless children and victims of Aids. He took lessons with an artist, Varenka Paschke, under whose guidance he made his own drawings, based on newly taken photographs of the prison island; his strong colours infuse the lithographs that a printmaker produced from his originals. But the experiment turned sour in 2005 when Mandela sued his lawyer, Ismael Ayob, for failing to account properly for sales of the lithographs. He even claimed some of \u201chis\u201d signatures were forged. Ayob stopped selling them and in 2007 paid Mandela 700,000 rand. Now the London sale has apparently attracted Mandela\u2019s ire [see footnote]. Does he, perhaps, feel unhappy that he created the lithographs at all? They do not possess the eloquence of his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, or of the famous photograph of him talking to Walter Sisulu in the prison yard, taken secretly in 1966. Perhaps this is what happens when you try to sell a memory, even for the best of reasons. In fact, Mandela\u2019s most memorable work of art can been seen on Robben Island itself. At a reunion of inmates in 1995, he was the first to take a stone and place it on the ground as a memorial. Everyone else did the same and the result is the Reunion Cairn, a simple monument that endures silently under the Atlantic sky, while tortoises crawl past and penguins squawk. But some of the natural beauty of Robben Island comes through in Mandela\u2019s lithographs, bright as they are with the colours of survival. \u2022 The headlines on this article were amended on 26 May 2016, after we were contacted by representatives of the Belgravia Gallery, to reflect the gallery\u2019s strong denial of claims of forgeries. The gallery says it did not receive any communication from Nelson Mandela or his family asking it to stop selling his art or saying that he \u201cstrongly dissociates himself\u201d from the art or the exhibition. It says it had a personal association with Nelson Mandela and that he stated publicly how much he enjoyed creating the artwork it was selling. Each signature was independently verified by a signature expert."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
