This Pennsylvania county may hold the key", "bodyText": "In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Larry Hallett erected Donald Trump billboards outside his roadside diner in eastern Pennsylvania, where he handed out Trump bumper stickers and presided over big breakfasts with a dozen or so regulars who got together to share their excitement about the Republican nominee. When Trump won, Hallett \u2013 an 81-year-old who restored classic cars on the side and led a Bible study \u2013 called it one of the highlights of his life. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fantastic,\u201d he predicted. Throughout Trump\u2019s first year in office, Hallett remained an enthusiastic fan of the president. \u201cI\u2019m pretty happy with the man,\u201d he would say. But, early in 2018, tragedy struck. Hallett went in for heart surgery and did not make it. \u201cEverybody was dumbfounded when they found out that he passed away,\u201d said Joan Hallett, his wife of 62 years. \u201cWe had an awful time, when we had to write up the obituary \u2013 he did about anything that you could possibly do.\u201d The old politics breakfast group had dwindled, she said. \u201cYou know we had this whole group of people, we talked about everything in there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re slowly dying off.\u201d In the two and a half years since Trump became president, his bedrock of support has not shifted. People who love Trump still love Trump. But life has changed in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, one of those crucial swing counties nationwide that voted twice for Barack Obama before flipping for Trump \u2013 and which could decide whether Trump gets a second term. If Trump wins here in 2020, he has a great shot at retaking the state of Pennsylvania, and at recapturing the White House, political analysts say. But if Trump loses here, he might become the first one-term president since George HW Bush. The fight to re-elect Trump has begun With its unusual knack for electing politicians from both major parties, the region around Northampton county has a distinctive politics. It also has a distinctive history, as the former home of Bethlehem Steel, which for generations produced plates and beams for warships and skyscrapers \u2013 a symbol of American greatness if ever there was one. Do voters here think Trump has delivered on his promise to \u201cmake America great again\u201d? Despite Trump\u2019s repeated proclamations that, thanks to him, the US steel industry is now \u201cbooming\u201d, steel in Bethlehem has shown zero signs of resurgence, former workers say. Frank Behum worked at Bethlehem Steel for 32 years. \u201cThe president is a pathological liar,\u201d Behum said on a recent morning near the silent row of rusting blast furnaces that went extinct 25 years ago. \u201cHe can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s been doing it his whole life and getting away with it.\u201d Some former steelworkers remain supportive of Trump, saying the president is doing his best to jump-start the manufacturing sector in the face of what they see as Democratic obstruction. But the question for Trump here is not whether he can hold his core supporters. It is whether he can expand his appeal enough to overcome lackluster approval ratings and a galvanized Democratic opposition, to find the extra votes he will need for re-election. \u201cI have challenges. I have more to gain. I definitely have challenges,\u201d said the Northampton county Republican party chairwoman Lee Snover, describing her effort to re-elect Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hold what I have, and I actually have to get new people. And I have to get more Democrats. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m banking on the Democrats continuing to be foolish and push nonsense.\u201d The fight to re-elect Trump has begun. With the first Democratic primary debates on the horizon at the end of June, here\u2019s what it looks like in Northampton county, Pennsylvania. How Trump could lose Trump\u2019s victory in Northampton county in 2016 was built on a combination of factors: the candidates in play, the policy terrain and the electorate. All three of those things have changed in Northampton county in the last two and a half years \u2013 each in ways that might look not so good for Trump. The electorate has changed On election night 2016, the more white, rural areas of Northampton county witnessed the same turnout phenomenon that played out in the Florida panhandle, the Ohio rust belt and the Michigan exurbs. In Northampton, turnout jumped 11% from 2012. \u201cAt 8 o\u2019clock at night, they were five and six wide, all the way around the building, and all the way out to the parking lot,\u201d said Larry Hallett at the time, describing voting lines. \u201cTrump all the way. And that\u2019s the way it went.\u201d But since then, the electorate in Northampton has changed. While some older voters have died, new residents \u2013 commuters, retirees, warehouse industry employees \u2013 have moved in, and a flood of new voters has entered the field, with turnout among young voters tripling from the midterm elections of 2014 to the midterm elections of 2018. That turnout drove huge gains for Democrats in the Pennsylvania state legislature, while the Democratic governor won re-election with 57% of the vote. In a US senate race, the incumbent Democrat beat a virulently anti-immigrant Trump cutout by 13 points. \u201cWhat was very impressive in 2018, for a midterm election, were turnout levels among youth voters,\u201d said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \u201cAnd if you add that group in the mix, if you look at where the president stands in that group \u2013 it\u2019s daunting math for the president.\u201d Healthcare has become a key issue In 2016, when Trump ran on a call to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obama\u2019s healthcare law, known as Obamacare, polling indicated that the policy stance did not move the needle much either way for him. But since then, when it comes to healthcare policy, Trump\u2019s approval rating in Pennsylvania has dived, while it has solidified as the No 1 most important issue for voters. According to this year\u2019s edition of the annual Pennsylvania Health Poll conducted by the Muhlenberg College Public Health Program, a majority (51%) of Pennsylvania residents disapprove of the way that Trump is handling the issue of healthcare, with only 28% approving. \u201cIf you look right now, it remains, I think, from a policy perspective, his greatest weakness going into 2020 in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Borick. \u201cHe\u2019s below 30% approval rating on this particular issue. There\u2019s lots of strong disapproval, while the Affordable Care Act [Obamacare] is fairly popular in the state. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he fixes that issue before the election.\u201d The \u2018hater vote\u2019 Three years ago, Trump was a popular candidate in Northampton county. But he also drew a lot of votes from people here who avidly disliked his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In dozens of interviews in the last three years with Northampton county voters, including Democrats who supported Trump, antipathy towards Clinton came up again and again as the main reason for their votes. A similar boost \u2013 call it the \u201chater vote\u201d \u2013 is not likely to be available to Trump in 2020. The most problematic candidate in the 2020 race for Trump, however, might be Trump. No incumbent president in the history for which we have reliable numbers has won re-election with less than around 49% approval. For pretty much his entire presidency, Trump\u2019s average approval rating has been stuck where it is now, around 41%, give or take a few points. Trump, however, still has time to lift his approval rating. And there is always the chance that this time, history might not apply. How Trump could win The key challenge for Trump in Pennsylvania is to create excitement that not only turns out his base, but spills over into voters who did not catch the fever in 2016, said Borick. \u201cThe popular wisdom is that Trump squeezed about just as much as he could out of the state last time\u201d in terms of voter turnout, said Borick. \u201cBut if he can keep those folks aboard, and maybe bring in a few more folks on the margin, who maybe didn\u2019t vote at all in 2016, then he can make further gains.\u201d Snover, the county Republican party chairwoman, has a plan to help Trump win again. \u201cWe\u2019re running the Stop the Nonsense campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we feel every issue the Democrats are running on and putting in the forefront is nonsense.\u201d Snover named the Green New Deal, the campaign for abortion rights, Medicare for All, free college tuition and the impeachment of Trump. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the Democrats overplay all these things,\u201d said Snover. \u201cThey\u2019re not real issues that hard-working Americans base their vote on.\u201d Talk to Trump supporters, and it\u2019s easy to see how Snover\u2019s message could resonate. \u201cIf anything, the Democrats continuing to do what they\u2019re doing is making the resolve of those of us that support him that much stronger,\u201d said Bruce Haines, a hotelier and former steel executive. \u201cThe fact that they continue to harass him like this just strengthens the resolve of the people I talk to \u2013 not just the Trump supporters, but the Trump-agenda supporters. \u201cSo I think support is going to strengthen as we get closer to the election. And as we sort out who he\u2019s going to run against \u2013 will it be a socialist, or will it be [Joe] Biden?\u201d In conversations about opponents who could challenge Trump in Pennsylvania, the most frequently recurring name is that of Joe Biden, the former vice-president who was born and raised in the state and who currently dusts the Democratic competition in polls of Pennsylvania voters. The idea is that Biden could lure back the large proportion of registered Democrats in Northampton and elsewhere who switched sides to vote for Trump in 2016. But counterbalancing that theory, for Democrats, is the concern that a candidate like Biden, a white man and a senior citizen, would sap the enthusiasm of grassroots progressives looking for a fresh face. It\u2019s not yet clear which other Democratic candidate might emerge to challenge Trump here. Many supporters of the president are quick to take Trump up on his branding of the entire field as \u201csocialist\u201d. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like socialism. People that are working people, you know?\u201d said Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 78, who has cut hair in downtown Bethlehem for five decades and who switched parties from Democrat to Republican in 2016 to vote for Trump. \u201cThe socialists don\u2019t know how to pay the bills.\u201d Snover, who calls hardcore supporters of the president \u201cTrumpers\u201d, expressed confidence that despite the Republicans\u2019 lackluster performance in the midterms, Trump voters would materialize in 2020. \u201cI just think these Trumpers are a different animal, they\u2019re like a sleeping giant,\u201d she said. The Promise \u201cIn one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming!\u201d Trump tweeted last month. If that were true, few Americans would be more capable of declaring it so than Ron Keschl, 76, who had five main jobs at Bethlehem Steel over four decades: sintering plant foreman, ore yard foreman, car tip foreman, blast furnace drillman and coke works foreman. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it around here,\u201d Keschl said of Trump\u2019s claim that US steel is back. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything around here. You can\u2019t get it back. That whole thing is gone.\u201d Two weeks ago, engineers dynamited one of the most powerful symbols of the former local industry, the 21-storey Martin Tower in downtown Bethlehem. The former headquarters for Bethlehem Steel is now a giant pile of rubble \u2013 with twisted orange steel beams set to one side for recycling. Summer is coming once again to Northampton county, when Saturday nights at the Trolley Shop, the Halletts\u2019 restaurant, are marked by gatherings of classic car enthusiasts featuring live music and outdoor dancing. Larry Hallett, the community pillar, used to emcee the event. \u201cEverybody misses him,\u201d said Joan Hallett. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. I just can\u2019t get over it, because we were together constantly.\u201d But as politics go, she said, not much has changed. \u201cWe\u2019re all for Trump yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
