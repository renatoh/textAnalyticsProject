Alley is widely regarded as one of the finest cricketers never to have played a Test match. Rejected for the 1948 Australian Ashes party because he was \"too old\", he was still scoring centuries for Somerset and giving batsmen nightmares with his military medium pace and barrack-room one-liners 20 years later. It's a fair guess that the current Australia side are a sight fitter than Alley ever was and, judging by the opening of the latest Ashes battle, a good deal less vociferous too. Last week it was reported that Ricky Ponting's men have been instructed to cut out sledging and swearing. Reviewing an incident involving Chris Adams, Mark Boucher and some rather catty insults back when the century was younger, Richie Benaud remarked, \"It's a shemozzle. Not just an ordinary shemozzle but a straight-out, full-blown shemozzle.\" Those traditionalists who feel that the good of cricket would be best served if we all tucked our shemozzles away, unblown, will have been gratified by the Australian Cricket Board's directive. Indeed, aside from Paul Collingwood saying, \"I've decided that on balance wearing sunglasses on top of my cap makes me look a right pillock\", it is hard to think of anything that would surprise or delight lovers of the summer game's finer aspects. Many people, of course, believe the Australians invented sledging. Some even go so far as to lay the blame at the steel toed boots of one bloke, Alley's contemporary, Cec Pepper. Pepper was a man who lived up his name. He was so fiery it's a wonder his cap never caught fire. Like Alley, Pepper was regarded as one of the finest all-rounders of the post-war years, but he never played Test cricket for Australia. This was because early in his career he had roundly abused the great Don Bradman in a Sheffield Shield match. The exact wording of Pepper's verbal onslaught on the Don is not known, but since he taunted another batsman who had played and missed at his leg breaks throughout an eight-ball over with the words \"You can open your fucking eyes now. I've finished\", reacted to a loud blazer worn by another by yelling, \"Jeez where'd you get that jacket, off the back of a bloody horse?\" and responded to a spectator criticising his use of some choice Anglo-Saxonisms by smacking him in the mouth, we can probably hazard a guess that it didn't include any quotations from Proust. I should observe that during my own years of playing cricket at a level so low you could have slid it under a duck, I never encountered any of this sort of systematic abuse (the fact that I never batted for longer than two balls may have been a contributing factor, admittedly). It was certainly not because the people I played with and against were a bunch of milksops. Far from it. In fact, if our captain hadn't been a probation officer we would have struggled to put a side together. It was just that in public park cricket you rarely knew anything about the opposition. Much though you may have felt moved to echo Fred Trueman and yell, \"You've got more edges than a broken pisspot\" at the batsman, the urge was tempered by the knowledge that he might just be the kind of sociopath who would wait for you afterwards with a pair of bolt-cutters. No one who has seen all those photos of Kevin Pietersen in his boxing gloves will doubt the teak-hard toughness of the modern cricketer, but my feeling is that even ruthlessly uncompromising beasts such as Steve Waugh would have been less likely to start questioning an opponent's courage, if in the back of their mind was the notion that he might be the brother of the geezer who controlled the local steroids trade. Whatever the truth or otherwise of everything, the fact is that by the latter part of the 20th century Australia was so well established as a sledging nation that before the 1999 World Cup Scotland felt moved to call in David Boon as a sledging adviser. Part of Boon's role must surely have been to explain the arcane etiquette that apparently governs insults on the cricket field. The existence of an unwritten sledgers' code came to light in the late 1990s when several players, including England's Yorkshire-Australian Craig White, complained that taunting by some members of the Sri Lankan team had gone beyond the bounds of acceptability. The exact nature of the insults has never been made public, though we were perhaps given an insight into the sort of things they might have contained by the comments of a former Australian rules footballer, Barry Stoneham. Talking about sledging it was all part-and-parcel of a red-blooded game, but \"you can't slander people with personal remarks about their lifestyle\". The message to any cricketer considering slinging a few putdowns this summer is therefore: call a man anything you like, but never, ever criticise his CD collection, his carpets or his decision to plant African marigolds next to bright pink pelargoniums."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
