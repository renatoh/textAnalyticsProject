Many have come a cropper on Augusta National's infamous home straight and, as with the Masters, holes 12, 13, 15 and 16 hold most terrors on Gran Canaria. The 22-year-old Garcia had four strokes to spare over Italy's Emanuele Canonica after finishing 13 under par on 275 to pick up his \u00a3176,000 prize, but only after his cosy seven-stroke cushion had been whittled down to a single stroke with five to play. Garcia's troubles began at the uphill 12th, almost driveable at 329 yards but a nightmare in yesterday's bruising wind. As on Friday he drove out of bounds, having to settle for a double-bogey six. The par-three 13th plunges almost vertically to the green below, where the wind direction is fiendishly deceptive. Garcia missed the putting surface and took four. That meant he was now only one clear of the Swede Carl Pettersson, the winner of the Portuguese Open three weeks earlier, and with the torments of the 15th and 16th ahead victory was far from certain. But there was no pressing the panic button by the world No5, who matched Pettersson's birdie at the 14th by blasting his tee shot a few feet off the green 298 yards distant. He bogeyed the next into the teeth of the gale when his attempt to cut the ball into the green ended 20 yards left, from where he pitched through the putting surface into a bunker. The par-five 16th, with water left and right, yielded a four. Garcia insisted: \"I knew I was only one ahead at one stage but I never thought I would lose it. I knew what I had to do. I was in the driving seat even though it looked like I wasn't for a while. \"I knew if I kept hitting good shots, stayed patient and played smart I would be fine.\" Garcia, just one year old when Severiano Ballesteros won the first of his three Spanish Opens in 1981, admitted: \"I've looked forward to winning the open of my home country and it gives me great confidence for the rest of the year.\" Pettersson's challenge ended when his two-iron from a bunker at the 15th ended in the water. England's Greg Owen shot 72 to take third place a stroke behind Canonica on 280 with birdies at the long 16th, where he hit the green with a two-iron, and the short 17th. The Mansfield man, only one behind Garcia at halfway, ended with a bogey and admitted that his concentration suffered from some interminable waits on the tee in a round that took 5hr 25min. Rafael Cabrera, a 17-year-old local amateur who looks another Garcia in the making, was poised to finish runner-up after birdie threes at the 11th, 12th and 15th but he closed with two bogeys to end joint fourth on 281 with Pettersson. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
