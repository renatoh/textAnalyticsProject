A majority of Britons will be obese by 2050 if weight gain in the population continues at the current rate, according to the weighty tome from the government think-tank, published today. But what steps should be taken to encourage young people to take more physical activity and eat more healthily in order to guarantee their longevity, and a healthy, happy life? There still remains a fundamental tension about whether the ultimate responsibility lies with parents, schools, local children's services or central government. Delegates attending a Guardian \"healthy kids\" summit on Monday looked in detail at government policy in this area and agreed that a more \"joined up\" approach was needed to tackle obesity and make healthy lifestyles an integral - and enjoyable - part of growing up. They agreed on the need to start getting the message out to youngsters as soon as possible - starting with toddlers in nurseries when this is practical. Rocket science it ain't but all the research shows that inactive children who eat unhealthy foods do not develop into active healthy adults. Delegates agreed that changes in society - and the impact of technology - have led to a more sedentary lifestyle with far less exercise. Families rely on quick and convenient ready meals laden with salt and trans fats which mean that the children never learn to cook at home. And they can't learn to cook at school either, because practical cookery has been subsumed into \"design technology\" and head teachers' priorities do not include proper cookery facilities. A target driven culture - kids \"must\" do at least two hours' physical exercise at school every week - seems to have replaced the notion that exercising and being active can actually be fun. So what are the answers? Better education about food and nutrition would help. Clearer and more transparent \"front\" and \"back\" of pack labelling would be a good first step, replacing the myriad of complex and competing schemes that baffle and alienate shoppers every day. The people who most need to better understand the importance of nutrition are those least likely to spend a long time scrutinising the backs of cornflake packets in the supermarket, or reading sweet labels for e-numbers. A 9pm watershed for junk food TV adverts would help enormously. That was called for again this week by the health group Sustain. (The group has put together an informative pamphlet on the government's failures: \"Missing the Target\" (pdf)). This would reduce children's exposure to this type of advertising by 82%. It is supported by a broad coalition of health, children's and consumer groups as well as by Ofcom's own advisory committee for England, the Office of the Children's Commissioner, and the Food Standards Agency. We are what we eat; for many children today that is bad news."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
