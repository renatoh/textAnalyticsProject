Authorities have been stressing the need to carry out a transition from the years of breakneck, double-digit growth to a more balanced, mature model with frequent repetitions of their \u201cnew normal\u201d mantra, used by Li several times in his speech in Beijing. The country narrowly missed its target of around 7.5% for this year, recording an official growth figure of 7.4%. \u201cWith downward pressure on China\u2019s economy building and deep-seated problems in development surfacing, the difficulties we are to encounter in the year ahead may be even more formidable than those of last year,\u201d Li warned the opening session of the National People\u2019s Congress, the tightly controlled legislature, as he delivered the government\u2019s work report. \u201cSystemic, institutional and structural problems have become \u2018tigers in the road\u2019 holding up development.\u201d Many analysts believe China will miss the new target, too. Yuan Gangming, of the China and World Economy Research Center at Tsinghua University, said: \u201cI predict the GDP growth this year will be below 7% and the real economic downturn will be worse than last year. \u201cThe good side is, there\u2019s an upbeat and young atmosphere in the NPC report, probably because the new leader is younger and more likely to explore in an innovative way. For example, he mentioned that the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the country is common people getting rich. \u201cHe also mentioned the importance of supporting private sectors such as IT and new energy...The imbalance of different sectors has to be broken and we\u2019ve paid too much attention to state-owned enterprises, which is ridiculous. I\u2019m glad the government has realized that and is willing to do some change.\u201d Economic commentator Wu Jiaxiang described the report as signalling \u201cseason two of Likonomics\u201d, though Li has been an unusually low profile premier. He said: \u201cAfter two year of non-stimulus and deleveraging treatment, China\u2019s economic health is restored and hence we are seeing more public investment in this year\u2019s work report. Reform provides the necessary drive for development.\u201d The annual meeting in Beijing is accompanied by a session of a political consultative body, where celebrity delegates such as basketball star Yao Ming sprinkle a little stardust over the staid proceedings. The biggest surprise at the NPC so far has been seeing tuxedoed men pour the tea for leaders, instead of the usual waitresses. Neither body is exactly known for its independence of spirit. The meetings allow the party to ensure that officials and business people are on the right page, and to gauge their mood. After two years, the most striking aspect of this administration has been the consolidation of the party\u2019s power and Xi\u2019s personal authority. His anti-corruption crackdown is in full swing and, like his talent for folksy language and popular themes, appears to have played well with the public. It is also intended in part to pave the way for reforms by weakening vested interests. But Steve Tsang, head of the Centre for Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cWe see him already being more powerful than his predecessors at this stage, but he cannot afford to relent or the fightback will start. \u201cWe should be seeing the leadership really focusing on what they want to do with power and the reinvigorated capacity of the party for delivering public services and better management of the economy, but we haven\u2019t seen very much in concrete terms of what they will be doing...[Xi] is locked into this process and that itself causes distraction from what he wants to achieve with the \u2018new normal\u2019 and \u2018four comprehensives\u2019.\u201d The latter is the latest official catchphrase, set out by Xi and lauded by state media as a brilliant guide to China\u2019s future: comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society, deepening reform, governing the country according to law and applying strictness in governing the party. The party is fond of political enumeration; previous examples include Hu Jintao\u2019s \u201ceight honours and eight shames\u201d, Jiang Zemin\u2019s \u201cthree represents\u201d and, much further back, Hua Guofeng\u2019s \u201ctwo whatevers\u201d. Hu Xingdou, a professor of economics at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said that the leadership had been focused on maintaining \u201cthe balance between deepening reforms and rolling out anti-corruption campaigns/maintaining stability, and the balance between the left and the right\u201d. Leftists have drawn renewed hope from aspects of Xi\u2019s leadership, including fulminations against western values. Fan Jinggang, a leading neo-Maoist, said the general political landscape was improving although rightists still dominated public opinion. He praised Xi\u2019s push to strengthen the party\u2019s ideological work and said his \u201cmass line\u201d campaign and crackdown on corruption had some similarities with Maoism in understanding the need to involve the masses in the party, rather than just relying on the elites. But Xi has made it clear that he has no intention of handing more power to the public. \u201cNot involving and mobilising the masses [in these drives] is a shame as it fails to delivery a satisfactory result to the campaigns, and it\u2019s also why we say the campaigns to a degree differ from Maoism\u2019s ideals and strategy,\u201d said Fan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
