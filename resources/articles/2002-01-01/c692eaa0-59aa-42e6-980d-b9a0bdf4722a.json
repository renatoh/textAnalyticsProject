The 18-year-old breaks a record set by Garry Kasparov, who won his first title aged 22 in 1985. Ponomariov will be honoured by the Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma next week and will then travel to Linares, Spain, for his first tournament clash with Kasparov. \"I feel a responsibility as world champion,\" he said. \"In my childhood, Kasparov and [Anatoly] Karpov were my heroes, but now I have no favourites. I prefer a universal style of play.\" Fittingly the oldest surviving world chess champion, Vassily Smyslov, now aged 80 and nearly blind, was present for Ponomariov's victory. Ivanchuk was favourite going into the match but brittle nerves let him down. Ponomariov crushed him in only two moves in their first game before Ivanchuk, with a winning game in the fifth round, threw it away with a series of blunders. Yesterday's final round was a damp squib. Ivanchuk's opening play was feeble and he had little option but to accept the teenager's proffered draw after 90 minutes' play. The new champion later said he had played with such a result in mind. Ponomariov, a slight, poker-faced and dour schoolboy, first came to prominence in a 1994 European children's event where he beat the favourite, England's Luke McShane. In 1996 and 1997, still only 12, he caused a stir by winning European and world titles at Under-18 level, and by 14 he was the youngest grandmaster of all time, breaking a record once held by Bobby Fischer. When Ponomariov came to the traditional Hastings congress in 1998, he spoke little English, got lost en route to the tournament venue, but impressed everyone. He would grind away at endgames for 100 moves and seven hours, ruthlessly exploiting tiny advantages. This is a trait shown by many of the great champions such as Fischer, Karpov and Kasparov. His most controversial moment so far came in last year's European Championship when he broke chess etiquette by going back on an agreement to play out a draw, prompting one grandmaster to say he would like to break Ponomariov's nose. He though, is not now the world champion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
