Young Windsor will not, we are told, be visiting the Nazi camp, but a lot of more serious grown-ups will be there this week for the 60th anniversary of its liberation. With so many events marking the final, cataclysmic year of the second world war, this is one to watch - and ponder. Vladimir Putin is representing the heirs of the Red Army; Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, born to a father who died on the eastern front, will be there as chancellor of a democratic Germany; Dick Cheney for the US, Jacques Chirac for France, the Israeli president, etc. The British government can muster only Jack Straw and Prince Edward, perhaps because, in a country still riveted by Dads' Army, the Blitz and the Few, the Holocaust has less resonance than the Battle of Britain and D-Day - though the BBC2 documentary on Auschwitz did almost outrate Celebrity Big Brother last week. Still, Thursday's ceremony should rank along with the moment Willy Brandt fell to his knees begging forgiveness in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, or when Helmut Kohl and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, reconciliation personified, held hands at Verdun in 1984. Auschwitz-Birkenau has come to embody the core evil of Nazism because of the industrial-scale killing of over a million people (Gypsies and gays as well as Jews), because the site was physically preserved, and because some survived, unlike the extermination camps - Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor and Chelmo - that the Nazis destroyed as Gotterdammerung neared. The Poles will be solicitous hosts, but this is not a role they relish. I experienced this once on a visit for Brussels-based journalists to see all those small farmers waiting for EU subsidies. As we left Warsaw, I happened to notice a signpost to Treblinka. It wasn't quite what our hosts, aware of Poland's own anti-semitism and pogroms, had in mind to display to opinion-formers from the European mainstream they were desperate to rejoin. But the group wish prevailed, largely thanks to the insistence of the Germans amongst us. On the edge of the forest on a warm summer's evening we walked the cobbled Himmelstrasse (\"the road to heaven\") that led the Jews to the gas chambers they had been told were shower-rooms, and saw the \"yahrzeit\" memorial candles and a faded wreath from a visiting Israeli army delegation - powerful reminders of connections and consequences that cannot simply be wished away. There was very little physical evidence - no iconic \"Arbeit macht frei\", over a sinister gate. But it still felt like the scene of an enormous crime. Auschwitz, like the Normandy landings last June, is passing from the realm of memory into history. In a few years there will be no one left who experienced its horror at first hand - thus the importance of the testimony of the remaining survivors, living challenge to Holocaust deniers and revisionists like France's Le Pen, as well as a grim, incontrovertible reminder of why so many angry Arabs and Muslims feel that Israel is the price Palestinians are still paying for European racism. Auschwitz is the right place to contemplate the very worst of the 20th century, to reflect that history never quite repeats itself (this summer marks the less distant 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims); and that a new Europe which has bound itself together to make war and genocide impossible, is, for all its flaws, a lot better than the old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
