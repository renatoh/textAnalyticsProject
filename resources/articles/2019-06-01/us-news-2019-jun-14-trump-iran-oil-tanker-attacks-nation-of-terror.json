Speaking with Fox News on Friday, the president rejected Tehran\u2019s denials that it was involved in the attacks and cited a video released by US Central Command late Thursday purporting to show an Iranian vessel removing an unexploded mine from one of the tankers. \u201cIran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the boat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re in deep, deep trouble.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t take it lightly,\u201d he added, pointing out the US had already reimposed tough sanctions on Iran. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told in very strong terms \u2026 we want to get them back to the table if they want to get back. I\u2019m in no rush.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came during a wide-ranging interview with Fox &amp; Friends on his 73rd birthday. Hours before Trump\u2019s interview aired, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the US was making allegations without \u201ca shred of factual or circumstantial evidence\u201d and accused the Trump administration of \u201csabotage diplomacy\u201d. Trump\u2019s appearance on Fox &amp; Friends came as he capped off yet another week mired in controversy. Trump ignited a firestorm on Wednesday by stating he would listen if a foreign government approached his campaign with damaging information about a political opponent. Trump also said he wouldn\u2019t necessarily alert the FBI, despite the widespread consensus that his campaign should have reported offers of Russian assistance in 2016 to federal authorities. Trump attempted to clarify his comments on Friday, telling Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cIf I thought anything was incorrect or badly stated, I\u2019d report it to the attorney general, the FBI, I\u2019d report it to law enforcement, absolutely. \u201cOf course you\u2019d do that, you couldn\u2019t have that happen with our country,\u201d he said. At the same time, Trump said he would still look at what information a foreign government was sharing, \u201cbecause if you don\u2019t look at it, you\u2019re not going to know if it\u2019s bad\u201d. Trump also stood by his senior counselor Kellyanne Conway after a US government watchdog recommended she be removed from office for repeatedly violating a law that limits political activity for government employees. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna fire her. I think she\u2019s a terrific person. She\u2019s a tremendous spokesperson,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt looks to me like they\u2019re trying to take away her right of free speech.\u201d The US Office of Special Counsel released a report on Thursday stating Conway had violated the Hatch Act on several occasions by disparaging 2020 Democratic candidates while acting in her capacity as a White House official. Conway had sparked similar ethics concerns by wading into the 2017 Alabama Senate election, the investigators said. \u201cMs Conway\u2019s violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act\u2019s restrictions,\u201d the report said. \u201cHer actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system \u2013 the rule of law.\u201d Trump denied Conway was in the wrong, telling Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d \u201cA person wouldn\u2019t be able to express themselves, and I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
