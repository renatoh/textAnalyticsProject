And, even by the permissive standards of Twitter, the ferocity of the personal insults flying between the pair has been unusual. Morgan accused Rowling of being \u201csuperior, dismissive and arrogant\u201d, and the writer attacked what she described as the \u201cfact-free, amoral, bigotry-apologism of [a] celebrity toady\u201d. The political grudge match began when Rowling, now known almost as well for her liberal social values as for creating Harry Potter, tweeted to tell her huge army of fans how much she had enjoyed watching Morgan being attacked by a forthright panel of commentators in an argument about the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency on the popular American current affairs discussion show, Real Time with Bill Maher. \u201cYes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is exactly as satisfying as I\u2019d always imagined,\u201d she wrote, linking her 9.5 million Twitter followers to an online clip of the show. Fellow guests on the Friday night edition of HBO\u2019s Real Time had been angered by Morgan\u2019s suggestion that there would have been little practical difference between a Clinton presidency and the Trump regime. The host, American comedian and critic Maher, said Morgan was wrong for suggesting that Clinton and Donald Trump were as bad as each other, arguing: \u201cDo you think Hillary Clinton would have a cabinet with Betsy DeVos and fucking Rick Perry? They wouldn\u2019t have a Muslim ban, they wouldn\u2019t be feuding with everybody in the world, they wouldn\u2019t be doing this shit with Russia. Are you crazy?\u201d Morgan replied that there was no Muslim ban, prompting his fellow panellists to jointly tell him to \u201cfuck off\u201d. The Australian comedian and commentator Jim Jeffries then jumped into the fray: \u201cThis is what you do, Piers. You say \u2018he\u2019s not going to do this, he\u2019s not going to do that\u2019. He went on to compare Trump to Adolf Hitler. Morgan then accused all his fellow panellists of becoming \u201chysterical\u201d. But the tone of the battle that ensued online later between Morgan, a former editor of the Mirror and judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, and Rowling was even more heated. When Morgan spotted Rowling\u2019s tweet, he replied: \u201cThis is why I\u2019ve never read a single word of Harry Potter.\u201d Instead of ignoring the jibe about her work Rowling picked up the cudgels: \u201cBecause you had a premonition that one day the author would roar with laughter at seeing you called out for your bullshit on live TV?\u201d Morgan defended himself again by arguing that everything he had said was factual, adding: \u201cIf you think screaming \u2018F**K OFF!!!\u2019 at me changes that, then you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d Rowling resorted to questioning his journalistic integrity: \u201cWould you like a couple of hours to mock up some pictures of refugees carrying explosives to substantiate your position?\u201d she asked. The row then became still more personal when Morgan said that Rowling\u2019s attitudes were the reason why Brexit and Trump had both won support at the polls in Britain and America. \u201cThe superior, dismissive arrogance of rabid Remain/Clinton supporters like @jk_rowling is, of course, precisely why both campaigns lost,\u201d he wrote. Later Rowling warned Morgan that his sycophantic attitude to Trump would be his downfall. \u201cIf only you\u2019d read Harry Potter, you\u2019d know the downside of sucking up to the biggest bully in school is getting burned alive.\u201d The sparring partners have previous form. In mid-November Morgan was rude about the premiere of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film written and produced by Rowling, on Good Morning Britain, the ITV morning news show he presents. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to not watch that either,\u201d he said blankly to his excited co-presenters, Susanna Reid and Charlotte Hawkins. Rowling had previously attacked Trump as a \u201cbigot\u201d following his election as president, while Morgan had quickly gone on the record about his friendly relations with the new White House incumbent.
