The Liverpool manager says his injury-hit side can defeat the Premier League leaders and will have \u201ca solution\u201d for Wednesday\u2019s match when, unlike during Friday\u2019s FA Cup tie at Exeter City, he will have a recognisable team available. But Klopp says a plan based on Arsenal\u2019s style will be doomed to failure and Liverpool must focus on the traits that produced impressive wins at Chelsea and Manchester City prior to their recent inconsistent run. \u201cArsenal and Ars\u00e8ne have their own style. It\u2019s possession football, so it\u2019s clear that, if we want to play the same way, we will be without a chance because they\u2019ve been doing it for longer,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cArsenal are not only a good possession team. That\u2019s the problem. They have good counterattacks, too, and that\u2019s what you have to be aware of. It\u2019s a job but it\u2019s a really nice job to think about solutions and how to stop them coming through with their plan. I like things like this. \u201cIt is always a big challenge to play these clubs but, if we showed something in these last weeks, it is that we have something like a plan against good football teams.\u201d Klopp said beating the league leaders was \u201cnot easy but it\u2019s possible\u201d and that his appreciation of Wenger, who marks his 20th anniversary as Arsenal manager this year, has grown since he arrived in the Premier League three months ago. \u201cIt is an absolutely amazing achievement and my respect grows day by day because it\u2019s really intensive in the Premier League, especially with a team with international matches too,\u201d said the former Borussia Dortmund coach. \u201cMy respect has grown since I\u2019m here. He\u2019s done a brilliant job, one of the best managers in the world. It\u2019s rare to do this over such a long period. It\u2019s always a challenge to play against him and it is a challenge I\u2019m looking forward to. \u201cArsenal, together with Manchester City, are the two best teams at this moment in the Premier League. To stay in a good position against City they need all the points and they cannot decide where they get them. They will show us they are ambitious this season. They are in a good moment.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s injury problems have alleviated slightly ahead of Arsenal\u2019s visit although Divock Origi faces another month on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on a knee problem that will sideline the Belgium international for another month. However, Mamadou Sakho is pushing for a start alongside Kolo Tour\u00e9 in defence and the captain, Jordan Henderson, is also available. Klopp had no established central defenders available against Exeter but may have the relative luxury of having two on Wednesday. Tour\u00e9 is fit having missed the trip to St James Park while recovering from cramp sustained in the Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City. Sakho has not featured since aggravating a knee injury at West Ham United on 2 January but is expected to return to fitness in time, easing Klopp\u2019s selection headache having had to select Tiago Ilori and Jose Enrique in the FA Cup. Dejan Lovren has recovered more quickly than anticipated from a hamstring injury and could be available for Manchester United\u2019s visit on Sunday, although Arsenal will come too soon, while Nathaniel Clyne, Alberto Moreno, Lucas Leiva, Emre Can and Roberto Firmino will all return having been rested on Friday. \u201cThe situation now is better than two or three days before,\u201d Klopp said.He did not mention Ilori in his list of available central defenders. \u201cI think Kolo will be available so we will have one senior centre-back. Mama wants to be available and hopefully we can use him. Martin [Skrtel] is still a few weeks. Dejan the time of injury was only six days [and needs] something like eight or 12, so it\u2019s close. There will be a moment if it\u2019s a risk if we can try, but it\u2019s not a moment for this yet. We have to look for Kolo and Mama and then the next one is Lucas.\u201d Klopp also confirmed Henderson has recovered from a heel problem that had sidelined him since the win at Sunderland on 30 December and Jordon Ibe will be available despite a hamstring concern. Daniel Sturridge remains injured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
