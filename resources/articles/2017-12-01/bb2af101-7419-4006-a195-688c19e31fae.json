The former West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City manager is in discussions with Steve Gibson, Boro\u2019s owner, with a view to agreeing a three-year contract to succeed Garry Monk, who was sacked late on Saturday night following the team\u2019s 2-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday. Gibson has known and admired Pulis for a long time and is believed to feel that the 59-year-old\u2019s pragmatic tactics will suit a Boro side who were moulded into a cautious, counterattacking unit during three years under Aitor Karanka. Monk\u2019s attempts to foster a more expansive approach had foundered during his seven-month tenure. With Gibson having invested around \u00a350m in new players \u2013 including the record \u00a315m buy Britt Assombalonga \u2013 last summer, while also pledging to \u201csmash\u201d the Championship there were fears that the former Swansea City and Leeds United manager would be unable to oversee an immediate return to the Premier League. Some senior players are understood to have been confused by the new philosophy and the side lacked a clear identity. Although Monk was said to be \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201cbaffled\u201d by his 9pm Saturday exit, Boro have won only 10 of their 23 league games and are ninth, 19 points adrift of Wolverhampton Wanderers, the leaders, and 12 short of second-placed Cardiff City. They are, though, only three points behind sixth-placed Aston Villa, who visit the Riverside for a potentially vital game on Saturday. By then it is hoped Pulis will be in the dugout with Craig Liddle, the caretaker, having reverted to his role in charge of the academy. After being sacked by West Brom in November, Pulis had said he wanted to take some time out of football and was particularly keen to spend Christmas at home with his family before taking on a new \u201cproject\u201d during 2018 \u2013 but it seems Gibson\u2019s powers of persuasion may have accelerated that process. Should negotiations between the pair founder, Boro\u2019s owner would be expected to turn his attentions to Nigel Pearson, who is managing OH Leuven in Belgium\u2019s second tier, Pearson and rivalled Monk for the Riverside post when it was last vacant in May. With James Beattie, Monk\u2019s assistant, having also been dismissed Liddle will be assisted by the former Boro defender Jonathan Woodgate until an appointment is made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
