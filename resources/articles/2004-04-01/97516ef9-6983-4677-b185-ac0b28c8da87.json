This does not mean that carving, casting, painting, dyeing, mosaic-laying, weaving or any of the other ways in which human beings in all recorded cultures have decorated, represented and worshipped the world are negligible. The visual arts have always existed, but the idea of \"art\" as a sphere of experience, the aesthetic realm, evolved between the 15th and 18th centuries in Europe. The first museums dedicated to the enjoyment of art, the first biographies of artists, the first recognition that even a fresco in a church demanded to be seen as a triumph of self-expression all date from this period. However, while churches were visited by many people as if they were art galleries, mosques remained sacred. From one point of view, the exhibition currently at the Hermitage Rooms in Somerset House, London, might be seen as another example of western secular misunderstanding of the religious significance of the visual arts in every time and place except this one. Here is a beautiful collection of, as the show's subtitle has it, Art from Islamic Lands, dating from the eighth to the 19th centuries. The exhibition, whose loans from St Petersburg's Hermitage are supplemented by treasures from the Nasser D Khalili Collection in London, presents Islamic creativity as something to be enjoyed in a gallery, by people of all faiths and none, in whatever way we choose. You could argue that this in itself is a betrayal of a cultural tradition in which religion is far more central than it has been for 200 years in the west. There is a frisson, a tension in looking at pages from the Qur'an in a gallery. To paraphrase Monty Python's Life of Brian, how should I enjoy them, O Lord - as works of art or documents of religion, as image or as writing? The earliest Qur'an in this exhibition was copied in north Africa in the eighth century of our era - that is, within a century or so of the death of Muhammad in 632. Writing soon became central to Islamic visual expression. Everyone half-knows why. The Qur'an does not expressly forbid representational art, but its condemnation of idolatry was interpreted by many theologians to mean just that. Since Muhammad was a prophet, not an incarnated god like Christ, there was no need for the intense figurative tradition of European painting and sculpture. Suspicious of representation and with no Son of God to represent, Islamic art turned away from trying to depict the visible world to elaborate decorative systems. Islamic art tends to the abstract. Instead of the body of Christ, its central element is the text of the Qur'an. The dreamlike flowing Kufic script (the calligraphic hand most commonly used by medieval transcribers of the Qur'an) that moves across empty space in the manuscripts at Somerset House sets you free from earthly concerns, slows you down, hypnotises. This is art - staggering art. In the 10th century, in north Africa or Spain, a scribe created a Qur'an on vellum dyed with indigo - the only known blue version of the holy book. Gold script flies in determined straight lines through the void, enriched by endless varieties of flourish, but always with a powerful sense of forward impetus: long loops make the letters energetic, like the flowing manes of horses. There is a striking difference between these books and the illuminated manuscripts produced in Europe in the same period. The Book of Kells, created in about 807, turns words, even single letters, into pictures. Such ornate pictorialism could not be further from the disciplined elegance of these early medieval Qur'ans. If they are art - and their formal authority insists on that word - they are a very different, strangely modern art. There was a political, as much as religious, reason for this. The conquest of the late Antique world by Arab Muslims happened within years of the death of the Prophet. By 643 the empire of the caliphs - successors of Muhammad - included Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Iraq; by 740, two-thirds of Spain. The Arab conquests did not happen in a vacuum, but amid the circuses and basilicas of the classical world: the first Islamic rulers who had the money and time to patronise specifically Islamic art inherited the splendours of Greco-Roman civilisation. Images were everywhere. The new rulers built desert palaces in Syria with baths and mosaics whose themes of hunting are not unlike those in a late Roman villa at Piazza Armerina in Sicily. In Cordoba, Roman columns were reused to build the Great Mosque. But if Islamic art could not escape the classical influence, it found a way to transform it that was intellectually and artistically brilliant. Instead of more art, Islam opted for less; its antipathy to representing the human figure instantly differentiated it from the classical tradition and pushed it towards abstraction, minimalism, mathematics. The Qur'ans at Somerset House belong to the same cultural world that created the Great Mosque at Cordoba, one of the world's supreme buildings. In the gold-on-blue Qur'an, there is a cool, relaxed sensuality, like a fountain gently trickling in a courtyard. Being inside the Great Mosque is like being inside one of these manuscripts: you walk among a repeating yet subtly varied forest of columns thatsupport particoloured arches and then, in an incredible flourish, a higher rank of arches resting on piers that surmount the columns. It is at once simple and profuse. The Christian west produced nothing like it before the Renaissance. Far from subduing pleasure and sensuality in art, the proscription on figurative portrayal pushed imagination into untold paradises of abstract fantasy. Nor was it a consistent proscription. In fact, Muslim artists in the middle ages created some of the most gorgeous celebrations of material life that exist. Arab rulers built palaces as early as they built mosques, and the eighth-century palaces that survive in Syria betray no constraints on enjoying this world. Their mosaics portray naked dancing girls and hunting. From the 13th century, the Nasrid rulers of Granada created the most alluring pleasure palace in the world, the Alhambra, whose abstract decoration is a fantasia of stucco decor, ceilings like artificial grottos, windows contrived to give unreal vistas, a world of magic. No wonder the courtly brilliance of Islamic artists was craved by the Norman rulers of Sicily who commissioned a strange interweaving of Islamic and Christian art in the Palatine Chapel in Palermo; no wonder Renaissance princes coveted majolica dishes whose name reveals their debt to the Andalusian lustrewares of Malaga. Hedonism would become what westerners associated more than anything else with Islamic art - but the image of harems and hookahs was not all fantasy. Islamic court arts were dreamworlds of rubies and emeralds and palaces that float in the blue air of Al Andalus. One of the oldest and most famous objects of luxury created by Islamic artists is in this show. The Bobrinsky bucket, named after its collector, Count AA Bobrinsky, was made and inlaid with silver and copper in 1163 - it is dated, and signed by three craftsmen. The owner's name is inscribed, too. He was a merchant, Rukn al-Din, whose bucket has pictures all over it: courtiers playing backgammon, horsemen fighting dragons and each other. Significantly, the use of this object is ambiguous: it may have been intended for its owner to make his ablutions on the pilgrimage, or for the baths, a ritual of the good life Muslim courts adopted from the Romans. It is quite a leap from the pure calligraphic Qur'ans to the earthly richness of objects such as an 11th-century incense burner in the form of a metal cat perforated by foliage patterns: how does it all fit together? As you progress through the diversity of Islam, the complexity becomes dizzying. Here are scenes of court life from Iran, where figurative book illustration became one of the great Islamic arts; here is a carpet with an image of a young man and girl conversing delicately under a tree; here are 19th-century erotic paintings. There are things here that feed the most extravagant western fantasies of oriental splendour. Paintings from Mughal India portray a court life where jewels are as common as flowers. A 17th-century Mughal flask for rosewater confirms that lifereally was like that. It is made of gold, decorated with 40 diamonds, 1,439 rubies and 509 emeralds. The truth is that the old myths of Islamic court luxury, dismissed today as western orientalism, contained a shred of truth. And anyway, romantic views of Islam, from William Beckford's Vathek to Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra, were far more useful to human understanding than today's fiction of an exclusively religious Islam that is, according to your politics, either a radical alternative to materialism or a threat to secular freedom. Everyone should look at the art of Islam. It confounds every stereotype - including the idea that Islam is identical in every time and place. Wherever Muslims settled in the middle ages, they interacted creatively with local cultures, whether classical, Jewish, Christian or Zoroastrian. Islamist terrorist groups and those they terrify both imagine Islam as a consistently militant force opposed to all other cultures. The history of Islamic art suggests otherwise. To see this, western eyes have to be allowed to indulge Arabian Night fantasies, \"orientalist\" romance. That, just as much as awe-inspiring purity, is part of the Islamic cultural heritage. Secular and spiritual life interwove far more richly, in the Muslim past, than in medieval Christianity with its equation of sensuality and sin. \"You love life, we love death,\" says the tape apparently made by those responsible for the bombs in Madrid. But life abounds in this exhibition. \u00b7 Heaven on Earth - Art from Islamic Lands is at the Hermitage Rooms, Somerset House, London WC2, until August 22.
