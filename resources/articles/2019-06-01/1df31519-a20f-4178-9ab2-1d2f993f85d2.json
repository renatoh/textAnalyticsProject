In the interview with the corporation\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, his first of the Conservative leadership campaign, Johnson also vowed he would never disclose what led to the loud row with his partner Carrie Symonds, which led neighbours to call police. Johnson repeatedly swerved questions on the detail of his Brexit plan but suggested he was not prepared to rip up the entire agreement, as hard Brexiter supporters have insisted he has promised to do. He said he intended to \u201cmake progress with the bits of the withdrawal agreement that we have\u201d but there could be \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d about the payment of \u00a339bn to the EU agreed as part of the deal. He said those issues, including the Irish border, would be tackled \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period.\u201d Johnson then admitted the UK would not be entitled to an implementation period without signing up to the current withdrawal agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly what I\u2019m aiming for \u2026 to get an implementation period,\u201d he said. He said he believed there were \u201cabundant, abundant technical fixes that can be introduced to make sure that you don\u2019t have to have checks at the border\u201d but conceded there was \u201cno single magic bullet\u201d to solve the issue of the Irish border. However, he said there was now \u201ca real positive energy about getting it done \u2026 I think on both sides of the channel there\u2019s an understanding that we have to come out, but clearly parliament has voted three times against the backstop arrangements.\u201d Johnson said he believed there would be a \u201cvery different outcome\u201d with UK negotiators determined to find an alternative to the backstop. \u201cWe were committed to it. We actually helped to invent it. We were the authors of our own incarceration. Take that away. Change the approach of the UK negotiators and you have a very different outcome,\u201d he said. He said he would make an absolute guarantee the UK would leave \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 by 31 October. \u201cIt is not where I believe for a moment we will end up. But in order to get the result that we want \u2026 The common sensical thing to do is to prepare for a WTO exit.\u201d Johnson said he believed he could get a no-deal Brexit through parliament if necessary, despite Tory MPs warning a prime minister headed for no deal would be likely to be brought down by Conservative rebels in a confidence vote. \u201cI think that MPs on both sides of the House also understand that they will face mortal retribution from the electorate unless we get on and do it,\u201d he said. Separately, Johnson said that he would never go into what had occurred between him and Symonds on the night the police were called to her flat. \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones. And there\u2019s a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that, really is, is, in a way that is not fair on them,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
