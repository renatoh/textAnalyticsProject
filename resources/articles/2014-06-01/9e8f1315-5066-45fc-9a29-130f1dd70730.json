Frank Lampard, the Chelsea manager said, had not really said farewell upon the end of his 13-year playing career at the club because he most assuredly would be back. Nobody knows precisely when or how but the owner, Roman Abramovich, has decreed it. Whenever Lampard is ready to return to Chelsea in a non-playing capacity, he will be granted the privilege of hand-picking his role. Mourinho even said that Lampard could become his assistant manager. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how difficult it was,\u201d Mourinho said of the face-to-face meeting with Lampard, when it was agreed the England midfielder\u2019s Stamford Bridge contract would be allowed to expire at the end of June. \u201cBut at the same time, I can feel some happiness about the process because, for sure, he comes back to Chelsea. Mr Abramovich \u2013 the No1, the most important person \u2013 wants very much for Frank to be back, I want him to be back, the staff want him to be back, so he comes back, for sure. \u201cThe other thing is that he can come back the way he wants. Mr Abramovich has left the door completely open for him on the understanding Frank can do anything he wants at this club. He can come back when he wants and, to repeat Mr Abramovich\u2019s words, the way he wants. \u201cHe can be a coach, he can start at the academy, he can start being my assistant at the same time because he is doing his coaching badges or he can start in a different role. He can decide: \u2018I don\u2019t want to start immediately at the coaching role, I want to be an ambassador, I want to work hand in hand with the CEO, representing the club in important places of our life.\u2019 It\u2019s not the end of Frank Lampard\u2019s career in Chelsea. It\u2019s just a little break.\u201d Lampard is 35 and believes he is fit enough to play on for \u201ca few more years\u201d. If it were his choice he would surely have preferred to continue at Chelsea, where he scored a club record 211 goals in 648 appearances and won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups, one Champions League and one Europa League. He started in nine of the club\u2019s 12 Champions League ties this past season, including the semi-final, first leg at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; he missed the second leg through suspension. And yet there was still the feeling he was no longer a first-choice selection. He started in only 20 of Chelsea\u2019s Premier League matches. \u201cHe\u2019s a man to play a major role in a team, not like [what] happened in the last year \u2013 playing sometimes, sometimes not playing, playing 60 minutes, not starting every game,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI think for him, for his mentality, for his personality, it\u2019s better to get a club and probably a competition where he is really the top man.\u201d Lampard has admitted he is considering an offer from New York City, the new Major League Soccer franchise that will launch in March 2015, although, if he accepts, it will most likely mean he will need a short-term contract for the first half of the next European season. Harry Redknapp, his uncle, would gladly take him at QPR. Lampard, though, whom Mourinho describes as the \u201cbest No8 in the last decade\u201d, is focused on the World Cup finals in Brazil, on adding to his 104 caps and helping the England squad on and off the field. \u201cI think the World Cup is the perfect way for somebody with more than 100 caps to finish his career in the national team,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI told him that: \u2018Don\u2019t go more than the World Cup. The World Cup is the right moment to finish.\u2019 Does he accept that? Yes.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is an exclusive analyst for Yahoo\u2019s football coverage.
