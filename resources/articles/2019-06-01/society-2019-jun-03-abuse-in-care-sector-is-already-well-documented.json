We query the suggestion that the publication of three reports and the recent BBC Panorama documentary \u201cshed much-needed light\u201d on this mistreatment. We are at a loss as to how much more light can be shone on well-documented and sustained human rights abuses, deaths, dangerous restraint and practices that are endemic in institutions and enabled by the clearly deficient and failing processes of investigation, oversight and external scrutiny. It is time to set aside the misted goggles that allow politicians, policymakers, regulators, commissioners and providers to somehow not see, hear or even reflect on the dehumanising and degrading treatment meted out to fellow citizens. This is about human rights and the duty to respect and protect rights, particularly of people incarcerated behind the closed walls of our institutions. The unconscionable lack of political will and leadership to ensure action and systemic change can no longer be tolerated. This is about holding to account each and every one of us, particularly those we entrust to either directly look after people in these settings or to oversee such provision.
