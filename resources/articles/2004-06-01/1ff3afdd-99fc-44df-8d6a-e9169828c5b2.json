But in place of Andrew Flintoff, who misses the series because of an ankle injury, comes a player who might not shape like Wayne Rooney but who has something of Wayne Rooney's shape. Anthony McGrath's stuttering one-day career is now entering second gear. First was a sluggish ride - and not just in the field. McGrath's combination of sturdy middle-order batting and equally sturdy medium pace never attracted much attention. Last winter, although he joined England's three tours, he played in none of the 13 one-day internationals. His retention for this series was not widely forecast. \"It crossed my mind I might not be involved,\" McGrath said, \"but you never know what the selectors are thinking and Duncan Fletcher and Michael Vaughan told me just to start well with Yorkshire and see what happened.\" He has started well and looks a more assured all-round player than he did during a brief, and unfortunate, dalliance with the Yorkshire captaincy. His medium pace is more deceptive than England will remember it, too, certainly a cut above the mediocrity purveyed by Rikki Clarke who England preferred in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. Now Flintoff stands down with what the chief medical officer of the England and Wales cricket Board, Peter Gregory, has memorably described as a \"posterior impingement\". How McGrath will wish to be a posterior impingement to New Zealand and the West Indies over the next fortnight. \"This could possibly be my chance, but the selectors have other options as well and Rikki has come into the squad. And after a very frustrating winter for me it looks like it's raining again,\" he said. Just like po-faced Wimbledon when it turned down big-screen coverage of England's match against Croatia, Old Trafford will remain a football-free zone for the Portugal game. Well apart from in the hospitality boxes, the committee rooms, the media areas and the dressing room. With the forecast \"unsettled\", not all the 18,000 sold seats are likely to be used. There are times when football is all consuming. McGrath, though, depicted himself as the one man whose attention would never wander, a player focused on resurrecting his career. If he does not make progress now then perhaps he never will. Nottinghamshire's Kevin Pietersen is English qualified in the autumn and he has died his hair blond in readiness, even if the roots are still showing when it comes to his off-spin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
