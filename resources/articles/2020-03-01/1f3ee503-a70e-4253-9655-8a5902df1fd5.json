The British No 1 is no more than \u201chopeful\u201d about Wimbledon, which is due to start on 29 June, shortly before the now delayed Olympics. Konta, still working through rehab on a knee injury that has slowed her progress for more than a year, said: \u201cEven just a few weeks ago, who knew we would be in this situation, constantly changing \u2013 and changing rapidly? Everyone is hopeful that the constant change could bring us a change for the better as well.\u201d The men\u2019s and women\u2019s tours, already shut down until 7 June with only a tentative commitment to resume in time for Wimbledon, now have seen the non-grand-slam centrepiece of their season crumble. As a member of the WTA\u2019s player council, Konta reckons the enforced pause could give the game time to \u201cthrash out the best course for tournaments, players, everybody, with [frozen] rankings and all those sorts of things\u201d. That, at least, was her agenda linked to the recent past, when Indian Wells was cancelled a month ago and the European clay season then put on hold. Konta has to dwell now on the inconvenient present and an uncertain future. She carries on in isolation \u2013 protecting against coronavirus, of course, but also in the absence of the backup normally available for elite players with injury. \u201cI got back from the US about 10 days ago. I have some equipment at home so I am able to train, but it\u2019s by no means ideal. I am trying to make the best of the situation. This is not ideal for the knee. I don\u2019t have access to the equipment that I specifically need: team, physio, fitness trainer, the best method to get the kind of stimulus that we want for the body and the knee. But I\u2019m not getting too stressed over it.\u201d Until Monday, Konta was visiting the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton but the facility has closed in line with government guidelines on isolation. \u201cI can\u2019t bring what I need into the flat. I need a leg-press machine. That specific knee exercise, I can\u2019t do right now. In this country, athletes still have access to our respective training grounds, as long as the necessary precautions are observed. But the goalposts are moving.\u201d As for Wimbledon, she said: \u201cI think more than anything it\u2019s important to be hopeful. Nothing wrong with being hopeful. For me, it\u2019s about not looking too far ahead; we don\u2019t know how it is going to develop. Now we know we are not playing until the beginning of June, that\u2019s the date we are working towards. When that changes, if it changes, we react to whatever comes next.\u201d Meanwhile she and her photographer partner, Jackson Wade, are holed up in their London flat as Konta keeps in touch with her parents in Eastbourne, and she is desperate to see them once travel restrictions are lifted. She is baking a chocolate chip banana loaf \u2013 which she\u2019d like to share, but can\u2019t \u2013 and trying to keep her dog, Bono, from upsetting her 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. \u201cThe next few months could be quite long,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cWho knows?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
