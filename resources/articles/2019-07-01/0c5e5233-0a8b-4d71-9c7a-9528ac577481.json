A confidential informant working with the LAPD secretly recorded multiple meetings of a group called Refuse Fascism in 2017, according to newly disclosed police documents. The LAPD transcripts, first reported by the Los Angeles Times and reviewed by the Guardian, were submitted in a criminal case against activists who blocked a California freeway during an anti-Trump demonstration. Police equipped an informant with a hidden recording device and had the individual attend Refuse Fascism gatherings at a local church \u201cin an attempt to elicit information regarding the closure\u201d of the freeway and to express interest in being involved \u201cin any such future activities\u201d, police wrote. Miguel Antonio, one of the activists who was monitored and recorded by the informant, and then subsequently charged with misdemeanors for shutting down the freeway, told the Guardian on Friday that he would not let the surveillance stop him from organizing. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared. We\u2019re not going to back down in the face of repression,\u201d the 28-year-old said, adding that this kind of spying was meant to discourage activists. \u201cYou\u2019re in a church, and you\u2019re meeting about organizing a peaceful protest, and you\u2019re running the risk of being charged with conspiracy or these petty crimes.\u201d The LA case is one of several across the country of law enforcement aggressively targeting anti-Trump and anti-fascist groups with monitoring and criminal trials. In Sacramento, police worked with neo-Nazis to pursue cases against leftwing activists, including seeking charges against anti-fascist protesters who were stabbed at a white supremacist rally. In Berkeley, police collaborated with a violent pro-Trump demonstrator to prosecute a leftwing group last year, and there have been similar controversies in Washington DC, Oregon and other states. The LAPD surveillance was particularly striking given that there was documented evidence of violence involving far-right groups in southern California around the same time, and that those white supremacist organizations do pose a serious threat, said Mike German, a former FBI agent and expert on local extremist groups. \u201cThis case seems to fall into a pattern of police agencies viewing anti-fascist organizing as terrorism, while overlooking the far more deadly and frequent violence perpetrated by white supremacists and other far-right militants,\u201d he said. LAPD did not conduct a similar spying operation on far-right groups while it targeted Refuse Fascism, according to the Los Angeles Times. In a statement released late Friday, LAPD said the agency\u2019s chief, Michel Moore, had \u201cordered a top-to-bottom review to determine whether the department\u2019s stringent requirements for the use of confidential informants were followed\u201d. The department was \u201csteadfastly committed to constitutional policing\u201d, and would \u201ctake all necessary and appropriate steps to investigate any potential concerns raised\u201d, the statement added. The city attorney\u2019s office, which is prosecuting the activists, declined to comment. On 27 September 2017, Antonio and a group of activists shut down a freeway in downtown LA to protest Trump, one year after his election. After they were arrested, LAPD sent the informant, who has not been identified, to monitor the group\u2019s meetings at the Echo Park United Methodist Church. During an 11 October meeting, the informant approached Antonio and said, \u201cAre we gonna do like any freeway things again\u2026or major things like that?\u201d, according to a transcript of a secret recording. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Antonio responded. The informant then said he was interested in joining future activities: \u201cI thought the freeway thing was pretty good.\u201d Antonio then explained to the informant his thinking behind disrupting people\u2019s morning commutes and raising awareness about Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims, LGBTQ people, immigrants and others. The informant attended multiple meetings after that and coordinated with an LAPD detective. In one case, police noted in a write-up that one of the activists was caught on the recording making a joke about the president, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an awfully hot coffeepot, should I drop it on Donald Trump?\u201d Antonio was eventually charged with several misdemeanors, including obstructing public movement on a highway, failure to disperse from an unlawful assembly and failure to comply with a law enforcement order. A jury recently deadlocked in the case, and a new trial is scheduled to begin later this month. Damon Alimouri, Antonio\u2019s lawyer, said the LAPD surveillance was \u201cunjust and outrageous\u201d, adding that he suspected this type of spying was likely to escalate across the country. \u201cThe further left that younger people go, we will continue to see law enforcement infiltrating these groups secretly,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo a certain extent, it might intimidate some, and I think that\u2019s the intention of the LAPD.\u201d Frank Wulf, the pastor of the church where the LAPD was conducting the surveillance, said it was \u201coffensive\u201d for police to \u201cinfiltrate a group whose purposes are clearly non-violent\u201d. \u201cThe government is interfering with the rights of protest in America,\u201d he said, adding that he worried about a chilling effect: \u201cYou never know if the person sitting next to you is a police informant or not.\u201d By permitting this type of surveillance, the LAPD also appeared to be violating its own standards meant to protect against unconstitutional monitoring, said Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. \u201cThe target for them was a group organizing in a church where there was no indication of any criminal activity that was afoot,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhat this story demonstrates is that the agency is frankly rogue.\u201d News of the infiltration was a reminder that the politically motivated surveillance that was common decades earlier in the US has not stopped, said Antonio, who also organizes with a group called the Revolution Club. He said that freeway demonstrations were meant to inspire people to get involved in organizing and remind them that the threats on people\u2019s rights are urgent \u2013 and that they can\u2019t wait until 2020. \u201cThere are concentration camps at the border, they are stripping women\u2019s rights to control their body, they are threatening war with Iran and they are destroying the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to act.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
