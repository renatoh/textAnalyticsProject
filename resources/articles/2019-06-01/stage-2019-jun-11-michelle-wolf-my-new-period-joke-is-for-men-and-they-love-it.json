Wear shorts on stage. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want people to look at my legs, I want them to listen to my jokes,\u201d she says. Wear heels on stage. \u201cI don\u2019t know how other women do it. I\u2019m so busy thinking about my feet that I\u2019m, like, disconnected.\u201d Tell Trump jokes. Tell political jokes. Tell easy jokes. Tell people what they want to hear. Describe any material from the new special due out later this year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give anything away,\u201d she says. Not even a tease, not even a tag, not even a deleted punchline? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d Which is to say that Wolf, a Daily Show veteran who broke out with the blistering HBO special Nice Lady in 2017 and a burn-it-down turn at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in 2018, is not particularly accommodating or nice. Because there are things that are better than that. Like being funny. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about people liking or not liking me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think about making people laugh.\u201d It\u2019s a weekday afternoon and Wolf has arrived \u2013 in a headscarf, workout top and shorts (I didn\u2019t notice her legs) \u2013 at a Manhattan cafe just a few blocks away from the Comedy Cellar, where she tries out her new material. \u201cThe Cellar\u2019s my most productive place,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also kind of my home.\u201d It\u2019s a home she has sometimes had to share with the disgraced comedian Louis CK, for whom she used to open, but she doesn\u2019t plan to leave. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a woman\u2019s responsibility to give up her spot,\u201d she says. She grew up with two older brothers and spent her post-college years in finance before breaking into standup, a move from one boys\u2019 club to another. But her humour \u2013 spiky, shrewd, wrong-footing, with fart jokes \u2013 is very much embedded, tampon string attached, in the female body. \u201cBecause so much of comedy comes from your life experience, and so much of my life experience happens to be being a woman,\u201d she says. She has already cornered the market in period jokes. Here\u2019s an old one: \u201cThe only thing you ever really ask about periods is, \u2018When is it gonna be over?\u2019 And we always give you the same answer, \u2018Soon.\u2019 Cause we have no fucking clue. It could be over in 20 minutes, it could be over in 10 days. It can be over in three days and then take a break for two days, and then come back for a day. It can be gone, and then we just put on clean underwear and it\u2019s like, \u2018I smell white.\u2019\u201d Wolf says: \u201cI\u2019m really lucky because I get all these premises that haven\u2019t been thoroughly explored before.\u201d Being a girl in a boys\u2019 club has its privileges. Not that she settles for clapter or you-go-girl woo-hooing. \u201cI\u2019m not, like, a buy-my-own-drinks kind of feminist,\u201d she says at the start of her last special. \u201cWe all have our lines. Mine is at the bar.\u201d She won\u2019t be drawn on the overwhelming maleness of comedy nor the lack of diversity in late night. (She had a brief talkshow foray with The Break, which Netflix commissioned for 10 episodes.) \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. And while she waits she\u2019ll keep telling jokes. Though best known for the correspondents\u2019 dinner, a no-quarter routine that ultimately confronted the press corps, she doesn\u2019t see herself as a political comedian and she doesn\u2019t do Trump jokes any more. \u201cAll that guy wants is for people to talk about him, whether it\u2019s positive or negative, so I try to not give him that,\u201d she says. When she thinks of a joke, she bounces it around in her head for a while, then writes it down or records it as a voice memo, maybe texting it to a friend or two. She often dreams up new tags, new phrasing while she runs. (Her hobby: ultramarathons, though she has recently started pilates. \u201cReally exploring my whole white woman-ness,\u201d she says.) Before she films a special, she\u2019ll try it out over 100 or so hour-long sets, plus all those Comedy Cellar slots. She shows me a picture on her phone of her setlist after a weekend of shows. I can\u2019t read the jokes for all the arrows and addendums. \u201cIt does make me look like a crazy person,\u201d she says. Her devotion to her work is total. She joined Raya (Tinder for celebs) in hopes of matching with some athletes, but has never returned a message. \u201cI rarely meet a guy that I\u2019m actually interested in enough that I\u2019d want to take time away to even go out,\u201d she says. After we\u2019ve chatted for an hour and a half, the cafe refusing any money \u2013 \u201cAmerican heroes don\u2019t pay for tea here,\u201d the waitress says \u2013 Wolf finally divulges one detail of her new show. There\u2019s another period joke, a different one. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly for men and they surprisingly love it so far,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of the plan to convert them to being on board with periods. \u201cIt\u2019s a long game. But I\u2019m in it.\u201d \u2022 Michelle Wolf is on tour in the UK from 19 to 24 July, including Latitude festival on 20 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
