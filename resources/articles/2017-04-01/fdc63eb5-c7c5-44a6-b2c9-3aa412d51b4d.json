Morrison is set to signal a major restructure or possible downsizing of the agreement at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute in Melbourne, in a speech justifying the government\u2019s opposition to abolishing negative gearing and spruiking its plan to encourage super funds and other large pools of capital to invest in housing. On Monday the Australian reported the government was considering removing tax disincentives for retirees to downsize their homes and allowing first-home buyers to access their super to enter the housing market. According to the report, the model under consideration would allow first-home buyers to divert superannuation contributions into a home savings account, to be matched dollar-for-dollar by contributions from personal savings. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has warned the plan could drive up prices, although Michael Sukkar, the assistant minister to the treasurer, has suggested it could be done in a more targeted way. In the speech Morrison will say the national agreement does not link funds to the delivery of supply of public housing and, despite $9bn spent through it over eight years, Australia has 16,000 fewer public housing dwellings. \u201cWhile supply of social housing dwellings, inclusive of community housing stock, has risen by 13,672 over this period, the public housing waiting list has risen from 177,700 to 187,000. You simply despair.\u201d Morrison will say the agreement is an example of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d policy on housing affordability that has been a \u201cconfirmed failure\u201d. He notes that rather than achieving a 10% reduction in the proportion of low-income renters experiencing rental stress, this measure has increased from 35.4% in 2007-08 to 42.5% in 2013-14. Homelessness has also increased, from 90,000 in 2006 to more than 105,000 in 2011, a 17.3% increase compared with the agreement\u2019s target of a 7% decrease. \u201cThis agreement is a one-way ATM providing important resources without accountability for outcomes,\u201d Morrison will say. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to spend more, and it\u2019s not necessarily about spending less, provided we spend it better.\u201d In the speech Morrison defends what he calls the government\u2019s \u201cscalpel\u201d approach to housing affordability compared with the \u201cchainsaw\u201d approach of Labor, which proposes halving the capital gains tax discount and prospectively abolishing negative gearing. Morrison will say that more than 1.3 million Australians negatively gear their investment properties, and two-thirds have a taxable income of $80,000 or less. \u201cAustralian residential property investment is more geared to capital gain than yield,\u201d he will say. \u201cIf mum and dad investors were not part of our private rental market, there would be fewer rental properties available, meaning higher rents, further crowding out those on lower incomes and even greater pressure on already overstressed community and social housing resources.\u201d Morrison will say that regardless of \u201cthe merits or otherwise of negative gearing, it is an established and structural component of Australia\u2019s housing markets\u201d. \u201cDisrupting negative gearing would not come without a cost, especially to renters, let alone the wider economic impacts,\u201d he argues. Although the speech effectively rules out changes to negative gearing, Morrison makes no mention of restructuring the capital gains tax discount, which is believed to be under consideration in the May budget. Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the government\u2019s \u201crefusal to act on negative gearing\u201d was pushing it to adopt \u201cbad ideas\u201d. \u201cBad ideas like allowing access to superannuation for housing, an idea Malcolm Turnbull once described as thoroughly bad, and which Mathias Cormann was strongly opposed to it as late as last month,\u201d he said on Monday. Bowen said Morrison was \u201ccrying crocodile tears\u201d about rising rents despite the government abolishing the national rental affordability scheme. He noted it had also abolished Labor\u2019s first home saver account system, that used government co-contributions rather than super to help save for a deposit. Morrison notes that the government has set up an affordable housing working group to investigate \u201cinnovative financing models\u201d, including a bond aggregator model to harness large-scale private investment for housing. \u201cThe working group found a \u2018financing gap\u2019 is a major barrier to the supply of affordable housing. \u201cIt\u2019s a gap between the low rates of return available on affordable housing investments compared to market returns available on alternative investments with similar risk profiles.\u201d Morrison notes there is a \u201cclear appetite\u201d for pension funds to invest in housing in the US and Canada and linked it to proposals for key workers to be able to rent or buy in the communities they serve. \u201cWhat could be more in the interest of nurses, teachers or police pension fund members than investing in affordable housing for nurses, teachers and police officers?\u201d In a statement on Monday, construction industry super fund Cbus called for the government to fast-track the bond aggregator model by committing to it in the May budget. The chief executive of Cbus, David Atkin, warned that first home buyers should not be allowed to \u201cdip into their retirement savings for a house deposit\u201d and called on the government to immediately rule it out. Speaking on 3AW in Melbourne ahead of the speech Morrison appeared to downplay incentives for retirees to downsize, noting there were a \u201cmyriad of factors\u201d that led people to stay in their homes. He said that apartments left unoccupied by foreign investors was a \u201cbig issue ... that\u2019s got my attention\u201d, signalling possible changes to unlock latent housing stock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
