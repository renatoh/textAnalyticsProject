The question is posed in Howard Davies's very funny, very deep and subtle revival of No\u00ebl Coward's masterpiece. Private Lives is generally referred to as a light comedy; if this is light comedy, King Lear is a vaudeville turn. The great delight of this evening is that it offers pain and exquisite pleasure in the same outing. It slips down like velvety hot chocolate spiked with wormwood. Coward's 71-year-old, fresh-as-sushi play is dazzlingly constructed from the brilliant idea of a divorced couple meeting and rekindling their desire while on the first night of their honeymoons with their new partners. Elyot has married young Sibyl, a nice, conventional young ninny, and Amanda has hooked up with Victor, a wet-behind-the-ears tweedy type. But they have eyes and hearts only for each other. One drink, one tune (\"Strange how potent cheap music is\"), and they are lost. Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan have the on-stage chemistry to make you believe it. Rickman's hooded, languid amusement is the perfect foil for Duncan's fragile, jagged steeliness, and they never let you doubt for a nanosecond that this is a passion so grand that it could kill. Duncan - never on better form - suggests a woman who has abandoned herself to love but who also has a presentiment of all the pain that will burn her in the future. All this is achieved without sacrificing any of the play's comic perfection or its lightness of touch. These qualities are mirrored in Tim Hatley's south of France hotel, modelled after the leaning tower of Pisa, which transforms for the final two acts into a pink chocolate-box boudoir that could no more contain the passions of Elyot and Amanda than it could two ravening tigers. Emma Fielding and Adam Godley succeed in making Sibyl and Victor more interesting than usual, offering comic relief to Rickman and Duncan's creations, two helpless, devouring creatures whose triumph and tragedy is that they want all or nothing at all. \u0095 Until January 6.
