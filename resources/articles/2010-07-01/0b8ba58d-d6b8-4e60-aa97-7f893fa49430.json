Mandelson also claims that one Liberal Democrat negotiator, Danny Alexander, now Treasury chief secretary, pressed Labour to agree to reforming the elctoral system without bothering with a referendum. David Cameron has denied in the Commons that the Lib Dems tried to get him to agree a switch to the alternative vote for electing MPs, without first staging a referendum to obtain voters' approval. Both claims about the Lib-Lab talks have been made before, but it is the first time the assertions, likely to put Clegg in a questionable light, have been backed by detail. In his memoir serialised in today's Times newspaper, Mandelson claims Clegg secretly told Brown: \"Please understand, I have no personal animosity whatsoever. But it is not possible to secure the legitimacy of a coalition and win a referendum unless you move on in a dignified way.\" It is possible the Liberal Democrats were seeking to maximise their negotiating position with both Labour and the Conservatives, and believed the demands would be impossible for Brown to accept. Brown did offer to step aside as prime minister, but was unable to get an agreement to form a coalition. During the election campaign Clegg sent mixed messages about whether he would ever accept a deal with Labour if Brown stood aside. Once the outcome emerged, Clegg said publicly it was not for the Liberal Democrats to tell Labour the identity of its party leader. But it appears from Mandelson's account that after the election Clegg repeatedly demanded that Brown stand aside as the price of a deal, a position repeated by Lord Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat leader. Brown was reluctant to answer, but came under pressure to stand down by Tony Blair, who was contacted by the parties. Mandelson said: \"The Commons meeting was held in great secrecy. Mr Brown was accompanied by Lord Mandelson, and Mr Clegg by Danny Alexander, now Treasury chief secretary. Mr Brown and Lord Mandelson walked through the tunnel between No 10 and the Ministry of Defence to avoid being seen, and were picked up by a car there. \"Mr Brown did not give a clear answer to Mr Clegg at the time, provoking despair among Lib Dems still hoping for an agreement with Labour. But the pressures on him from his own side had been growing. and a conversation with Mr Blair must have played its part.\" Mandelson said Blair felt a left-of-centre coalition government was good in principle. \"But Gordon could not stay \u2026 Tony told him and me that the public would simply not accept Gordon remaining.\" Clegg has always insisted he made a deal with the Conservatives because he believed it would not be possible to form a stable coalition with Labour due to the two being unable to command an overall majority. He has also claimed there was no appetite amongst Labour MPs, citing John Reid And David Blunkett. In the talks, Clegg told Brown his party was \"knackered after 13 years in power\". The Liberal Democrat negotiators also claimed that the Labour team, including Ed Balls, showed little interest in a deal, judging by their body language and a refusal to shift on fundamental issues . Mandelson reveals the key meeting was held in the prime minister's office behind the Speaker's Chair, attended by Clegg, Brown, Mandelson and Alexander. Brown had spent the days after 6 May desperately seeking ways of working with the Lib Dems. He even drew up a \"coalition cabinet\" containing Clegg, Vince Cable and Ashdown. Even before the Commons showdown on the Saturday, Brown's allies had accepted his departure would be required. Mandelson writes that he, Andrew Adonis, Ed Balls, Alastair Campbell, and Sue Nye, Brown's assistant, were worried about the personal price he would pay if he was seen to hang on too long. Many Labour MPs believed a coalition would only be possible if he went. By now Brown accepted this but wanted to avoid the impression of being pushed out. \"I have been humiliated enough,\" he told Mandelson. On the Monday, Alexander rang expressing Clegg's fears that the message about leaving had not got home. Then Ashdown called saying Brown staying on was a \"deal-breaker\". But Brown had, on the Sunday, spent in Scotland, accepted his departure, and told Lord Mandelson he would not be an obstacle. At a Commons meeting Brown told Clegg that a new Labour leader would be in place by October, something Brown then announced later that day in front of No 10. It is alleged that late in the negotiations Clegg changed his position, and told Brown to remain in office since he secretly wanted Brown in Number 10 to increase his negotiating had with the Conservatives. Brown's s team have claimed after collapse of the talks that they felt they were being used by Clegg, and he was pressing Brown to cling on so he could have time to finalise his deal with the Conservatives and sell it to his party. Brown lost patience, and told Clegg he could not wait any longer before going to see the Queen to resign. One reason was Mandelson did not want him to leave No 10 at night. It meant Clegg was in a coalition before his party had signed a final deal, and Cameron arrived in Downing Street more in the twilight. \"I was fearful that if the denouement was delayed much longer, Gordon would have to leave Downing Street after dark. That was not the image I wanted for his leave-taking.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
