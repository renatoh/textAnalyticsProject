Mr Despard and those who think like him have not read my article very carefully, or they would have appreciated my argument that Irish generosity would on this occasion coincide with Irish self-interest, since a modified withdrawal agreement would be far better both for Ireland and the UK than a no-deal Brexit, the most likely alternative. Indeed, with a modified backstop, the withdrawal agreement would almost certainly have been passed by the Commons and Boris Johnson would not be on the doorstep of No 10. Boris can thank the backstop for his coming accession to the premiership. So perhaps Irish policy has been self-defeating.
