Speaking to the BBC, the leader of the Liberal Democrats said that, just as he could not countenance recommending to his party that it entered into a coalition with a Labour party that was not serious about balancing the books, he would not suggest it went into government with the Conservatives if they insisted on a plan that was a marked departure from what the two parties had done in the current coalition. Whereas the Conservative party has pledged to make \u00a312bn in social security cuts by 2017-2018, the Liberal Democrats have said they would cut \u00a33bn. \u201c[The Conservatives] are asking for \u00a312bn over two years,\u201d said Clegg, speaking to Newsnight\u2019s Evan Davis. \u201cWe\u2019ve made \u00a320bn over five. They want to ask the poorest to make additional sacrifices while not asking the richest to pay an additional penny through the tax system to balance the books \u2013 that\u2019s downright unfair.\u201d The deputy prime minister stressed that he was proud of the coalition\u2019s record, which he said he didn\u2019t think could be described as rightwing. Clegg has previously avoided speaking so explicitly about policy red lines that his party would not cross in future coalition negotiations, but the front page of the Liberal Democrat manifesto is reserved for five policies that the party has said would be a priority for it. The Lib Dem leader frequently says that the party implemented four out of five of the policies on the front of its 2010 general election manifesto in government. George Osborne has come under pressure to explain how the Conservative party would find cuts to the welfare budget of \u00a312bn, saying such things would be agreed as part of a wider spending review after the election. Speaking after Osborne announced March\u2019s budget, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said: \u201cWe have been told about no more than \u00a32bn of the planned cuts to working-age benefits. And, remember, apparently the \u2018plan\u2019 is to have those \u00a312bn of cuts in place by 2017-2018. It is time we knew more about what they might actually involve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
