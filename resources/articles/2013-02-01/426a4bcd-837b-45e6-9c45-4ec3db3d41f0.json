To be honest, I can think of a few things finer (in fact about 10 billion), but he does seem to mean it. Monty's enthusiasm is not put on for the camera, I think \u2013 it's real. He really does love his hedges. Normally I picture him in an English garden, a little unkempt (both him and the garden), digging with a fork, probably in autumn. There are leaves, compost, a bonfire, perhaps; soil and toil. He stops to wipe the sweat from his brow. English ladies, Radio 4 listeners, swoon. Here though, in Monty Don's French Gardens (BBC2), he is wandering around the grand gardens of great chateaux \u2013 Chenonceau, Vaux-le-Vicomte, Versailles. The spadework has all been done, centuries ago, by vast armies of men, moving earth, digging great canals, planting those enormous hedges. There's a hell of a lot of maintenance, of course, but it's all clipping and snipping and mowing. And Monty's not doing it himself. He's just a spectator. At least it's raining. I don't care much for the gardens, to be honest \u2013 all that parterre, clipped order and symmetry, which you can only really appreciate if you're the Montgolfier brothers. They don't seem very romantic places to me, even if there is romance in their histories. And the ridiculous scale of it all, going on and on, just because so-and-so had a garden that went on and on. But there are good stories behind them \u2013 of queens and lovers, of jealousy and bitter rivalry, of keeping up with the Fouquets. Still: thank God for the revolution, and for the loss of horticultural formality that came with it. Monty's a good guide, though: he tells these stories well, and with genuine enthusiasm \u2013 not just for hedges, but for history, France, and his 2CV, too. Nice wheels. Plus we get to hear him speak French. More swooning, I imagine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
