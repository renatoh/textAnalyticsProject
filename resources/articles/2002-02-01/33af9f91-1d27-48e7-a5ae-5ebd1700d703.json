They always called him \"Chat\" and nothing has changed. Taylor will also talk technique if anyone asks and, with England's wicketkeeping slot currently in a state of flux and inexperience in evidence, he has been summoned by the England coach Duncan Fletcher to help restore the confidence of the raw 21-year-old Jamie Foster. And now the stand-in keeper Marcus Trescothick, the premier batsman who donned hideous scarlet gloves for Saturday's match in the WestPac Trust stadium, wants to seek his counsel as well. With Foster going through a tough time the 26-year-old Trescothick, who kept wicket through school and club cricket but has scarcely done so since he was 17, finds himself pushed to the forefront. The chances are that he will retain the gloves for tomorrow's third one-day international at McLean Park which, with England 2-0 down in the five-match series, could be decisive. England have arrived in what is considered the world's Art Deco capital - an earthquake destroyed the city centre in 1931 and it was rebuilt in the style of the day - and yesterday, as the rest of the team were packing up their kit and climbing into minibuses, Trescothick and Foster were putting in extra work. \"I still see myself as a specialist opening batsman,\" Trescothick said afterwards. \"But circumstance has called for a stand-in. I'm really enjoying it and all the practice I have to put in. I'm rekindling my old skills, in a manner of speaking.\" On Saturday he made a tolerably good fist of the job, even standing up to Craig White, who was bowling briskish off-cutters. The conditions, Trescothick found, were favourable for trying to fill both roles and he was not blaming the distraction or exhaustion of keeping for his subsequent failure with the bat. He was out in the second over without scoring. \"Conditions were certainly a lot easier than India, where it is hotter. It was nice out there and I was not troubled. I would have liked to play a decent innings, though, to see how tired I would be.\" The prospect of playing a dual role would not be a practical proposition were the heat and humidity extreme, as they were, say, last winter in Sri Lanka. \"I think it would be pretty difficult,\" Trescothick said. \"It is hard enough fielding for 50 overs and I'm sure keeping would be even more intensive in those sort of conditions.\" The indifferent form of Foster with gloves and bat have prompted Fletcher and Hussain, with the approval of the chairman of selectors David Graveney, with whom Fletcher is in daily contact, to jettison him, however temporarily, under the guise of giving him a rest. They have realised that a wicketkeeper who is performing little more than moderately and who bats indifferently in the lower order is taking up a valuable place. With Alec Stewart not around and possibly never to return, the successor is not apparent. Trescothick is reluctant to look beyond the short term. \"There is something in it for the team, isn't there?\" he said. \"If it gives them the extra option of a different plan and the inclusion of another key player, then fine. I don't see it as a massive option unless things change drastically. So we'll see how we go in the short term and, if I keep in more games, then we'll have to assess it after that. But honestly I don't see it as long-term at this stage.\" If Trescothick retains the gloves tomorrow, the only change England might contemplate is to recall the all-rounder Jeremy Snape in place of Ashley Giles, who was milked, especially by Craig McMillan, is less than fleet in the field and is not contributing with the bat. Ben Hollioake is fit again, however, and should this game go awry then England, if they are to finalise the majority of their World Cup squad after this series - in their own minds at least - will want to have a final look at him. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
