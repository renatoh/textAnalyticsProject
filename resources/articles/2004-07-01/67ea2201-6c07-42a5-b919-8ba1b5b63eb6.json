Keith Lamb, the club's chief executive, said Hasselbaink would not be the last recruit. Boro are expected to take Boudewijn Zenden back to the Riverside on a permanent transfer from Chelsea and they are believed to have returned to Stamford Bridge for what will be their final summer signing - Geremi. The 25-year-old midfielder is surplus to requirements at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho and had a successful 12 months on loan at Middlesbrough the season before last. However, there is also strong interest from Galatasaray. Geremi was one of those rotated regularly by Claudio Ranieri last season and was unable to establish a regular starting place. It is not known how much Boro will have to pay Chelsea. Hasselbaink, 32, joined on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract, and he immediately echoed Viduka about Boro's Champions League aspirations. \"If we could do something there it would be a magnificent achievement, it'd be history.\" The former Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Crossley, meanwhile, is set to move to Leeds and become the first-choice keeper at Elland Road. The Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan expects to tie up the move of the Leeds and England defender Danny Mills early next week. Mills, 27, met City officials yesterday and reached an agreement in principle to join the Blues on a free transfer. Keegan has been particularly keen to recruit a right-back as the Chinese international Sun Jihai will miss the opening weeks of the season because of duty in the Asian Cup. The West Ham midfielder Kevin Horlock has signed for Ipswich Town on a free transfer. The 31-year-old Northern Ireland international has agreed a two-year contract with an option for a third year. Everton's David Unsworth is set to join Portsmouth on a free on Monday but Newcastle's Lomana Lua-Lua is unlikely to join him as Pompey's pay offer does not match that of West Bromwich Albion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
