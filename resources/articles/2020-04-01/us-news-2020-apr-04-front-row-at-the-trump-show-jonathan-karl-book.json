OK?\u201d Trump went on. Karl, he said, was \u201ca wise guy\u201d too. What viewers may not have known is that the two men go way back. They first met in 1994 when Karl was a cub reporter at the New York Post and Trump, a millionaire property developer, gave him a tour of Trump Tower, where newly married couple Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were staying. The result was a front-page scoop: \u201cInside Michael\u2019s Honeymoon Hideaway\u201d. Now president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, Karl recounts the episode both at the start of his new book, Front Row at the Trump Show, and in a phone interview with the Guardian. \u201cThe thing that blew me away about that moment, my first real introduction to Donald Trump, was the way he understood exactly what my job was and how to make a compelling story, and the way he operated so quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going through handlers and PR advisers and spokespeople. It was Donald Trump: \u2018Come on over, let me show you what I got.\u2019 There was no filter. It was him and he was incredibly, in a way, charming and we had a great story and he was willing to break rules to tell it. \u201cThere was intense security all around, keeping the press at bay, and here\u2019s Donald Trump bringing me right up to Michael\u2019s apartment, showing me their secret vehicle to get in and out of the place. He didn\u2019t play it the way it\u2019s normally played.\u201d Karl, 52, adds: \u201cI knew that I could call him from that point on whenever I wanted to and he would be accessible and willing to play along and loved to be in the mix. The idea that I would go on to become a White House reporter, president of the White House Correspondents Association, and he would be the president is kind of mind-blowing.\u201d Trump\u2019s gut instinct for publicity and reptilian genius for making media weather would be evident in his 2016 election campaign and throughout his presidency. The White House press secretary\u2019s daily briefing was killed off and replaced by \u201cchopper talk\u201d, before Trump boarded Marine One on the South Lawn. He has turned the daily coronavirus updates into a new form of campaign rally. Karl reflects: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three White House press secretaries, we\u2019ve had \u2013 I guess depends on how you count \u2013 three or four communications directors in the Trump White House, but in reality we\u2019ve really only had one. Donald Trump has always been the press secretary, the spokesperson, the communications director for Donald Trump. That was true in 1994 when I first encountered him and it\u2019s absolutely true in 2020.\u201d Karl finds himself promoting a book in the middle of a pandemic. He has been doing TV interviews from remote locations. Stephen Colbert teased him for speaking from a home office where his Emmy awards were prominently displayed. One of Karl\u2019s most memorable anecdotes is about 10 November 2016. It has become a commonplace to quote the musical Hamilton\u2019s song The Room Where It Happens but Karl was genuinely in there, witnessing the Oval Office meeting between President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump (and snapping a few photos from 5ft away). And this collision of matter and anti-matter produced a surprise. \u201cIt was the first time that I saw what seemed to be a humbled Donald Trump,\u201d Karl recalls. \u201cHe seemed to be taken with the moment. I was almost imagining he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my God, what did I get myself into?\u2019 \u201cNobody thought he was going to win. I don\u2019t think he really thought he was going to win and here he was in the Oval Office, a place where he was gonna be returning in just a short period of time as the president and all the weight of all that meant and the problems he was gonna be dealing with and the responsibility he was going to have. \u201cHe seemed humbled. He seemed a little bit freaked out. Now, that didn\u2019t last: we never saw that look again, really. That was a fleeting moment but it really struck me.\u201d When Trump was asked if he intended to ask Obama or any of his other predecessors for advice on dealing with the coronavirus crisis, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb them, bother them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say that there\u2019s probably a natural inclination not to call.\u201d \u2018Enemy of the people\u2019 For more than three years, Karl has been on Trump\u2019s trail, even receiving a hug from Kanye West in the Oval Office. He has also witnessed Trump\u2019s war on the media with barbs such as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d \u2013 a phrase which, Karl notes, the Nazis used in 1934. So what message does it send to the rest of the world? \u201cI think it is deeply disturbing that you have authoritarian leaders around the world who shut down a free press, jail reporters and potentially even worse and do so invoking the words of the American president. So you see Erdo\u011fan and Putin. You see it\u2019s been documented in Kazakhstan and in Egypt. You see authoritarian leaders echoing the precise words of Donald Trump, talking about \u2018fake news\u2019 as reporters are thrown in jail. \u201cThe other thing that I think is really troubling is when the president calls real news \u2018fake news\u2019, when he suggests that the act of being an aggressive reporter is \u2018treasonous\u2019, it has undermined the faith in an independent free press among a significant segment of the population. That\u2019s a big problem. I do worry about that a lot.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of the bully pulpit for his daily coronavirus briefings has led to renewed calls for the press corps to be more combative. In his book, however, Karl cautions against reporters behaving like a political opposition or the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere is a breathlessly negative tone to a lot of the news coverage of Trump and Trump\u2019s provided ample material to fuel that, but what happens is a segment of the population sees it and tunes it all out. It all becomes noise and everything is the outrage of the day and then it\u2019s hard to differentiate between a real outrage and an outrage that is maybe not as important. \u201cI mention the case of one CNN reporter literally getting up on live television and saying reporters should be protesting the president in Lafayette Square. We are not protesters. We are not the resistance. We need to report on a president fairly and objectively and a lot of that\u2019s going to end up being negative.\u201d He adds: \u201cYour north star is to provide objective and balanced news and let\u2019s remember that this president has branded the news media as the opposition party, so when those working for mainstream news organisations act like the opposition party, you\u2019re actually playing right into his media strategy.\u201d Karl\u2019s book draws on fresh research and interviews, including with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff. In 2017, Karl writes, Kelly had to talk the national security adviser, HR McMaster, out of passing on the president\u2019s order for a Venezuela war plan to the Pentagon. Now, however, as Trump faces the biggest test of his life, most voices of restraint are gone. Karl says: \u201cUp until this moment he\u2019s had a series of people in the White House who have tried to steer him or put some guardrails up. John Kelly made the most aggressive effort to try to protect Donald Trump from his most destructive tendencies. \u201cIt is all Donald Trump right now and I think that\u2019s potentially dangerous. Any president, no matter how competent, needs to have strong advisers. He\u2019s got the medical people that are advising him on this, sure, but those are not on his West Wing staff there. \u201cThis is truly Donald Trump calling all the shots and doing it by his gut instinct. So I think that is potentially worrisome, as is the way the truth has been undermined, the credibility of the White House and also the credibility of the press corps that he\u2019s tried so hard to undermine. Both of those things make this crisis harder to deal with day to day.\u201d \u2018An exhausting story\u2019 As the title of his book implies, Karl already had a front-row seat to history, reporting on the most peculiar president of this or any other age. Now there is a once-in-a-century global pandemic added to the mix. What a time to be alive. Is a part of him secretly enjoying the daily adrenaline rush? \u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting story,\u201d he says, suddenly sounding weary. \u201cYes, there is something rewarding about people wanting to know the story and the interest and the fascination in it, but it\u2019s exhausting and some of it\u2019s truly been troubling.\u201d He elaborates: \u201cI think, especially in light of what we\u2019re seeing with this pandemic, there is something very dangerous that is unfolding here. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point where nearly half the country doesn\u2019t believe what this president and White House says and we have nearly half the rest of the country that\u2019s been told not to believe what they see in a newspaper or see in television news or any other form of mainstream news. \u201cThat\u2019s a deeply troubling, deeply dangerous place to be where there isn\u2019t a shared agreement and sense of some basic facts, especially now where reliable information, and believing you have reliable information, can literally be a matter of life and death.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
