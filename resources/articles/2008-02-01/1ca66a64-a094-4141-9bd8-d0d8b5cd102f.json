The South African striker hit the opener past Jussi Jaaskelainen in the 23rd minute and put Rovers back in front after Kevin Davies had prodded the visitors level. McCarthy's second penalty brought an end to a fierce spell of Bolton pressure and further goals from David Bentley and Morten Gamst Pedersen wrapped up the victory. Rovers made an encouraging start and almost grabbed the lead inside the opening minute when a half-clearance fell to David Dunn 20 yards from goal and the midfielder's low shot was well saved by Jussi Jaaskelainen. The home side also forced an early corner and appeared intent on testing the fitness levels of their opponents in the wake of their gruelling midweek trip to Spain. Referee Mark Clattenberg looked to have problems controlling a predictably spiky east Lancashire derby and the home fans were incensed when Campo escaped punishment for going in late on Dunn. Rovers went ahead when they were awarded a controversial penalty in the 23rd minute, Clattenberg judging Gretar Steinsson, who appeared to be playing the ball back to his keeper Jaaskelainen, to have tripped the incoming Dunn. McCarthy stepped up to fire the ball low and straight down the middle to put Rovers in front at half-time. Megson made an attacking change at half-time when Gregorz Rasiak replaced Danny Guthrie, and within three minutes the big striker bundled home a Davies free-kick from close range but was ruled offside. But a minute later the visitors drew level when a long Matthew Taylor free-kick fell to Davies on the edge of the six-yard box, and he fired a low shot past Friedel at the second attempt.The visitors were rampant, and almost took the lead three minutes later when the impressive Nolan burst through the home defence and lashed a fine effort which was well saved by Friedel. Then with the home side reeling, another clever move by Nolan teed up a chance for Taylor, who rammed his shot over the bar from just inside the Rovers box. But Rovers were given the chance to retake their lead in the 65th minute when Cahill inexplicably hacked down Dunn in an unthreatening position just inside the Bolton box. Clattenberg had no option but to point to the spot a second time and McCarthy rammed his second spot-kick straight down the middle again to give the home side a scarcely-deserved advantage. Five minutes later Rovers had turned the game on its head when Dunn delivered a precise cross from the left and Bentley rose at the far post to nod the home side's third past Jaaskelainen. Bentley's goal took the wind out of Bolton's sails although tempers continued to fray and both Nolan and Campo were substituted seemingly to avoid either of the pair being sent off. The loss of Nolan affected Bolton, although they did fashion another chance deep in injury time when Gardner's deflected effort was saved well by Friedel. But Rovers had the final say with seconds remaining when substitute Jason Roberts crossed from the left and Pedersen stole in at the far post to put a surprising gloss on the victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
