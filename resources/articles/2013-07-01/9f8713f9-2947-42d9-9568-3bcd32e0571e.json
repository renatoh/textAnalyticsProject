Fashion historian Josh Sims notes that around 1913 both the Royal and the US navies shortened the sleeves on their servicemen's undershirts. \"The changes were ostensibly made to leave men's arms free when they performed deck chores or manned armaments,\" he writes in Icons of Men's Style. Slowly, it evolved: taking to cotton, insinuating itself into civilian life (\"You needn't be in the army to have your own personal T-shirt,\" advertised Sears in the run-up to America's entry into the second world war); and, apres Brando, adopted as a badge of rebellious youth. Imagine life without the T-shirt. Without the advertising provided by a million chests, Che Guevara and Bob Marley are half as famous. Nike and Adidas only make trainers.
