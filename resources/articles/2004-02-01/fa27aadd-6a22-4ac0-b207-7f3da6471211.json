As they say in Hollywood, the script was locked. Howard Dean was supposed to dominate Iowa and beyond, because he had already won the \"invisible primary\", amassing more money than any other candidate and soaring in the polls during the pre-election season. However, in the event, conventional wisdom was turned on its head in Iowa. The best organised candidate with local appeal, Dick Gephardt, flopped. The out-of-towner, John Kerry, did best. Mr Dean, the favourite, fell short. Nevertheless, he might still be in contention today had he not deserted the script with his \"I have a scream\" concession speech. Re-examining Mr Kerry's success, it is now clear that a series of unscripted moments turned his campaign around. When Jim Rassmann picked up a biography of Senator Kerry in a California bookstore, the Vietnam veteran, by chance, opened it at the exact page describing how Mr Kerry had saved his life in 1969, pulling him out of the Mekong delta under heavy sniper fire. For the lifelong Republican, this surprise encounter with his past compelled him to return the favour by saving the senator's political life. He called the Kerry campaign and asked what he could do to help. He expected to be stuffing envelopes in an Oregon state Democratic party sub-office - but Mr Kerry's campaign aides had other ideas, and flew him to Iowa. It was five days before the Iowa caucuses, and Mr Kerry was trailing in the polls. But when he and Mr Rassmann met for the first time in 35 years, amid a throng of supporters at a raucous campaign rally, the genuine outpouring of emotion cut through the set script. The candidate, who - up to this point - had looked great on paper but struggled to connect, suddenly had a human side. A clutch of morning show interviews with the veteran who \"came home\", accompanied by footage of the reunion, when the senator cupped his comrade's chubby face in his hands, sent the Kerry campaign into overdrive. A distant echo from President Bush's Vietnam is having a similarly unexpected impact on his political fortunes, and the parallel could not be more paradoxical. While a brother in arms is bearing witness to Mr Kerry's heroism, a commanding officer is questioning Mr Bush's devotion to duty. Retired Alabama National Guard General William Turnispeed, to whom the young Mr Bush was supposed to report in 1972, can't remember ever having noticed him showing up. The unhelpful recollections of the General surfaced in 2000, as Mr Bush took on Al Gore, but Mr Gore could not use them effectively because of his own credibility gap on Vietnam. He had served as an army journalist in Vietnam, but claimed to have been involved in the real action there. The ascendant Kerry candidacy has lent the questions a new potency. You can be certain that the Bush White House did not expect to have to publicly dig through 30-year-old files to try and prove that their man did his military duty. Having sent the nation's young men to war in Iraq, the Bush team was counting on wrapping the flag around the incumbent. Suddenly, they find themselves on the defensive, unable to fill in a six-month blank in the president's military resum\u00e9. In every campaign, it is the unanticipated that provide the key turning points. These moments are what make campaigning so infuriating and campaign watching so much fun. Remember Bob Dole's unscheduled tumble from a podium in the 1996 race? Bill Clinton could never have used his opponent's age against him, but the sight of the septuagenarian in need of a zimmer frame sounded the death knell for the Dole campaign a month before election day. An unplanned moment in the 1992 race also left its mark, when a fleeting image of George Bush senior checking his watch during a town hall meeting in Richmond crystallised what many had suspected of him. Mr Clinton was feeling an audience member's pain, but the cutaway camera caught the President looking distracted. For millions of voters, those two seconds of video sealed the deal - not only did Mr Bush not feel their pain, he didn't seem to care. This year's major campaign surprise is the return of Vietnam as a defining issue - nobody thought that it would play a key role in the 2004 presidential race. Mr Clinton was supposed to have laid it to rest as an issue in presidential politics. If the US could elect a man who had avoided the draft, surely that war was no longer a concern in the race for the White House. Yet here we are still taking about it, and it's partly because this president is trying to sell himself as America's most patriotic against a putative opponent who has him trumped on the issue. But the missing months in George W Bush's national guard service go beyond the question of who would make a better commander in chief. They undermine his image as a straight shooter. America doesn't much care any more if you avoided service in Vietnam, but it will zoom in on a lie. If there's evidence of a cover-up, whether it's from 30 years ago or today, US voters will want to know about it, and will then act accordingly. Now that's a script worth following. \u00b7 Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
