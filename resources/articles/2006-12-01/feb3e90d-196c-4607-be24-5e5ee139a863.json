It was probably fate then, that City's record \u00a313.5m signing would ram Pearce's words back down his throat - which he did with his fifth and sixth goals since signing for Bolton, where Sam Allardyce once again appears to have unlocked the potential of a foreigner with a dodgy reputation. Of course, the likelihood is that it will turn sour for Anelka under Allardyce. But, for the moment, the Frenchman can do no wrong with the Bolton fans. Indeed, with this powerful performance he probably just reinforced what Pearce was saying; that here is a striker who should still be with one of Europe's major powerhouses. It took him only seven minutes to remind the Eastlands fans what they were missing by converting a fluid four-man Bolton move into the net following a final pass from Stephen Hunt. His second effort was sandwiched between a moment of controversy when City's Paul Dickov was convinced he had scored almost immediately from the kick-off when his header appeared to be over the line before Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen scrambled it away. Emboldened by their let-off, Bolton resumed their almost total control of the match and it was little surprise that they doubled their lead in the 25th minute when Henrik Pedersen, picked out on the eve of this match by Allardyce as one of the Premiership's most underrated players, ran at the home defence and set up Anelka to caress the ball home. For City this was another one of those frustrating days when their fans fear that Pearce - who is hugely liked here -is not the right man for a difficult job, and that if they are not careful the new year could herald an unpleasant few months fighting relegation. Nobody feels the fans' pain more than Joey Barton, who can always be relied on to throw himself wholeheartedly into the cause whatever the occasion. Unfortunately, he demonstrated what a fine line when, in the 87th minute, he was sent off for a late two-footed challenge on Abdoulaye Faye, which fortunately did no damage. Except perhaps to Barton's chances of an England call-up. It was little wonder that it was 'Psycho' Pearce who wore a mask of anger after the match while 'Le Sulk' Anelka had a huge smile on his face. Allardyce hopes that Anelka will not prove to be a short-term wonder before leaving in a huff again. 'He's been a top goalscorer in the Premiership in past years and still a terrific player at 27,' said the Bolton manager. 'He's laid his roots here and started to flourish, and we hope that continues.' Man of the match: Nicolas Anelka Has left a trail of disappointed managers in his wake during a career that should have hit great heights. Stuart Pearce is among those , but Sam Allardyce has experienced only the up side of Anelka. His goals could yet steer Bolton into the Champions League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
