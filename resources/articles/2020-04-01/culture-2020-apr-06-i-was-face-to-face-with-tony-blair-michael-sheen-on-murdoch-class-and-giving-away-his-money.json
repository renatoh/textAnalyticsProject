The sun catches the side of his face, lighting up his scraggly hair and beard. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have a garden to go out in. I know not everybody does,\u201d he says. In the current climate of famous people churning out endless videos of their isolation struggles from the side of a pool in a mansion, it\u2019s a telling sentiment. A few years ago, after a successful stage and screen career, the actor, 51, \u201crefocused\u201d his life away from entertainment towards community work and activism, and moved back to Wales from Los Angeles. He had been living there for much of the past two decades, to be near his eldest daughter, Lily (her mother is the actor Kate Beckinsale, and they remain close). \u201cAnd then when my daughter was 18 and went off to a life of her own, I realised: \u2018Oh, I can go home again now.\u2019\u201d He has a new daughter, six-month-old Lyra, with the Swedish actor Anna Lundberg, and the baby burbles away in the background as we speak. Having a young child has given him a sense of routine during the current crisis. He went on Newsnight recently, to talk about clapping for the NHS, which he called \u201cthat wonder of the world\u201d. The presenter, Emma Barnett, asked him for an isolation coping tip. \u201cAnd I said well \u2026 the baby has a routine, and I\u2019ve found that that\u2019s helping us. And then I noticed that somebody said that was an example of my condescending class-blind privilege,\u201d he says, smiling, and shakes his head. Sheen grew up in Port Talbot and there is a long history of showbiz in the family. His great great grandmother was an elephant- and lion-tamer, and his father spent some time as a Jack Nicholson impersonator. How does he define himself, in terms of class? \u201cGod, I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he says, \u201cI came from a working-class town, my family was a working-class family, for generations. My dad got a job in middle management at a certain point, and I suppose that took us up a step. My mum worked as a secretary, my grandmother was a cleaner at the local police station. But then I went off and became a successful actor. Middle class, I guess?\u201d Sheen feels a strong connection to the community he grew up in. \u201cMore and more as I\u2019ve got older, it\u2019s been that which has guided the choices I\u2019ve made, about what it is I want to do with the privilege and the resources that I do have,\u201d he says. Moving back to Wales changed his life considerably. He set up a production company, Red Seam, to develop specifically Welsh stories. \u201cWe have these incredibly big productions coming over here and using our locations and infrastructure and talent,\u201d he says, \u201cbut those stories are not about Wales.\u201d Sheen has so far managed to avoid the criticism faced by many famous people when they \u201cget political\u201d, probably because he isn\u2019t paying lip service to it. He really is there, doing the work. Acting was supposed to be on the back burner, yet Sheen has continued to appear on screen. Over the past couple of years, he has been in Good Omens, The Good Fight and the US drama Prodigal Son. \u201cI\u2019ve actually ended up spending the last six months in New York working, which is not what I intended,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I gave all my money away, I suddenly had to go and earn money again.\u201d He says he gave all of his money away to bring the Homeless World Cup to Cardiff last summer. With eight weeks to go until the big charity event, \u201csomeone completely fucked us over\u201d, says Sheen, leaving him with two weeks to come up with enough money to keep it afloat (event organisers have said it costs \u00a32m a year to put on). \u201cFive hundred of the most vulnerable people from all over the world [were] on their way to Cardiff, for a tournament that was potentially transformative and life-changing. And so,\u201d he says, as if it were the easiest decision in the world, \u201cI gave all my money to it.\u201d He will be paying it off for years, he adds, cheerfully, which explains why he\u2019s working in the US again, on Prodigal Son. But, he says, tactfully: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m forcing myself to do it. It\u2019s a great job.\u201d Soon, Sheen will return to British television, playing Chris Tarrant in Quiz, a three-part adaptation of the James Graham play that tells the story of the infamous \u201ccoughing major\u201d cheating scandal on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. Its director, Stephen Frears, got in touch to see if Sheen would be interested in playing Tarrant. \u201cLike most people, I felt like I\u2019d seen those episodes. Then I subsequently discovered they never got transmitted, so nobody had seen those episodes,\u201d he says. I\u2019m shocked. \u201cITV rushed out a documentary about it, literally the next week or something like that. So people think they\u2019ve seen it, but actually what they saw was the documentary, which was certainly true in my case.\u201d Sheen is well-known for playing real people: Brian Clough in The Damned United, David Frost in Frost/Nixon, Kenneth Williams in Fantabulosa! and Tony Blair, three times, in The Deal, The Queen and The Special Relationship. Is there a sense that whoever is casting Sheen has seen something of that real person in him? \u201cI suppose I have to assume that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, oh, Michael does real people, let\u2019s get him in to play whoever. When I look at all the real people I have played, the majority of them tend to be quite flashy. If you wanted to be ungenerous, you could say there\u2019s a bit of surface razzle-dazzle covering over slightly more questionable qualities. Not that I\u2019m saying that\u2019s Tarrant,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut that kind of frontman, the person who has lots of apparent confidence and ease.\u201d He has always chosen not to meet the people he will play. \u201cOnce you meet someone,\u2019 he says, \u201cinevitably you want to take responsibility for them. And no matter how it goes, if you really get on with each other and you really like a person, inevitably you will shy away from certain things.\u201d He did end up meeting Tarrant, a couple of days after he had finished filming Quiz. \u201cJust coincidentally, I bumped into him at the Pride of Britain awards. I was having a photograph taken, and I heard a voice going\u201d \u2013 he slips into an impeccable Tarrant \u2013 \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t look anything like me.\u2019 And there was Chris Tarrant.\u201d Just before he started work on The Special Relationship, which came out in 2010, he met Blair for the first time. By that point, he had already played him twice, and felt comfortable enough to meet him. \u201cHe was very wary of me,\u201d Sheen recalls. \u201cIt was interesting because he\u2019s clearly someone who is very socially charming and engaging, and clearly wants the social interaction to go well.\u201d He knew this anyway, he says, from all the research and work he had done. \u201cBut I could see that actively happening, at the same time as this other part of him was going: \u2018Hang on, this guy might be copying me.\u2019 There was an odd dynamic there. Also, it was very peculiar circumstances.\u201d This turns out to be an understatement. \u201cIt was at the Murdoch residence in Los Angeles,\u201d he begins. He had been introduced to Wendi Murdoch, as she was at the time, at a charity event in New York. \u201cAnd someone had said to her, that\u2019s the guy who plays Blair. And she got very excited about this. She said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m having a dinner for Tony soon, you must come.\u2019\u201d His curiosity about meeting Blair got the better of him. \u201cIt took a little while for it to dawn on me: oh, but it\u2019s going to be at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s house,\u201d he says. Before the party, Wendi had emailed. \u201cShe would get in touch with me and say, maybe you could make your hair look like him? Maybe you could dress like him, and we could hide you, and bring you out, and surprise him? I remember writing back to her in an email and going: \u2018I don\u2019t want to put anyone in an uncomfortable position, so I think we should just leave it.\u2019 I thought, she\u2019s going to have me jumping out of a cake or something.\u201d She told him not to worry, and to come along anyway. He drove to the party, in the Hollywood Hills. \u201cSuddenly I found myself face-to-face with Tony Blair,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he found himself face-to-face with me, with a group of people suddenly around us, and Wendi Murdoch saying: \u2018Tony? It\u2019s you!\u2019\u201d Another guest asked Blair if he thought Sheen\u2019s portrayals had been accurate. Blair replied that he had not watched any of the films. \u201cWhen people dispersed and it was just me and him, he started talking in fairly minute detail about individual scenes,\u201d says Sheen. Before they sat down to eat, he had an encounter with Rupert Murdoch himself. \u201cThere was a very peculiar moment with Murdoch. I remember standing looking out at the view, and then I realised that Murdoch was standing next to me. It was quite a hot day. I just remember seeing a little bead of black dye, running down his face.\u201d He drags a finger from his forehead down the side of his cheek. \u201cI thought, oh, Ozymandias.\u201d Sheen is fascinated by Blair\u2019s legacy now, by how his personal popularity has been shredded and how deep divisions about that era continue to rage within the Labour party. But the relationship he has with the real people he has played is a strange one. \u201cObviously, Blair is someone I played the most,\u201d says Sheen. \u201cIt feels like a very long time ago now so it\u2019s not quite the same, but I still can\u2019t quite trust what I feel. Because there\u2019s still a little bit of me that when I see him or read about him that I\u2019m sort of seeing myself. That\u2019s a weird thing to have.\u201d When it comes to the current prime minister, he is less ambivalent. \u201cI don\u2019t know [Johnson], I\u2019ve never met him,\u201d says Sheen. \u201cBut my fear is that he\u2019s someone that it\u2019s all a game to. It\u2019s very hard to avoid the feeling that he\u2019s still playing games in a common room at his school. Aside from being totally opposite to his politics anyway, just as a personality, it\u2019s all a game, it\u2019s all about winning the debate, the empty debate. There\u2019s no real heart there, there\u2019s no real commitment there, to anything.\u201d Sheen finds the existence of the two versions of Johnson\u2019s column on Brexit, one arguing for remain, and one arguing for leave, particularly abhorrent. \u201cOne of the most consequential and divisive things in our cultural life, and the man who was at the forefront of it could have gone either way, really.\u201d He says this as if still astonished by it. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to trust someone who can go so easily in different ways.\u201d Sheen has done so much political work, from campaigning to end high-cost credit agreements to trying to help find a solution to the crisis in local journalism, that he is often asked if he harbours political ambitions. \u201cI think my condescending class-blind privilege is getting in the way, to be honest,\u201d he says, smiling. Since he moved back to Wales and focused on community work, he has realised it is no longer enough to simply tell people what they are doing wrong. \u201cI\u2019m part of now trying to come up with a better way, rather than just criticising the way other people are doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to work with people that I really disagree with, or I have to try and find a way to compromise or find a way forward with people who you really don\u2019t agree with.\u201d As the situation stands, Sheen does not have to toe any party line. \u201cI could walk away from it all, whenever I want, and I\u2019d be fine, and there\u2019s a strength in that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d gain by giving that up, right now.\u201d So he has no interest in running for office? \u201cI used to say, there\u2019s only one community that I feel that I could in any way justify representing, and that\u2019s the community that I grew up in, and that position is already taken.\u201d It\u2019s taken by Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon. \u201cBut of course, he might be arrested for visiting his father, so that role might become vacant very soon,\u201d Sheen says. He is joking, though part of me hopes he might one day take the idea of Michael Sheen MP seriously, after all. Part one of Quiz is on at 9pm on 13 April on ITV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
