Go Easy is by far their most accessible yet, balancing the arty with the party beautifully to make for a set of danceable, hook-filled songs that bubble and bloom with an almost biological rampancy, shooting out tendrils of strange, snaking melody in every direction like vines enveloping a ruin. Acting Strange opens the album with a wriggly little riff twisting through a swirling cloud of noise, somewhat reminiscent of cult art-punks Chrome; Cleaning Up My Mess slows things down to a lilting, sunny lollop and adds some sweetly frazzled chants and an enormous, gorgeous spiral of a chorus; Working on Love is an irresistible wonky stomp that grabs and won't let go. It's one of a few great Australian albums getting a well-deserved wider release on Fire; Lower Plenty's devastating Hard Rubbish and Two Weeks by Scott and Charlene's Wedding are both highly recommended, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
