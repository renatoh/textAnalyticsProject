The judges for this unique Irish award, which is open to books in any language, have drawn up a shortlist from over 70 nominations made by 100 selected libraries throughout the world. Each library was allowed to nominate up to three novels and the eventual list spanned such diverse titles as G\u00fcnter Grass's My Century and John Grisham's The Testament. No English writers made the shortlist, and out of the six, two - The Love You Promised Me by Spanish writer Silvia Molina and the Russian satire The Clay Machine-Gun by Victor Pelevin - are translations. Scotland and Ireland are represented by Andrew O'Hagan's powerful tale of the end of socialist ideals, Our Fathers, and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's modern tragedy of morals and manners, The Blackwater Lightship. Canadian writer Alastair McLeod's look at his celtic roots, No Great Mischief, also made the shortlist, as did Margaret Cezair-Thompson's story of three women born into a divided, troubled Jamaica, The True History of Paradise. Now in its fifth year, the winner is chosen by an international panel of judges, which this year includes Indian writer Amit Chaudhuri and American historian Allen Weinstein. The winner receives IR\u00a3100,000 if the book is written in English and IR\u00a375,000 if the book is in English translation, allowing the translator to pick up IR\u00a325,000. Nicola Barker won last year's award for her novel Wide Open. The winner will be announced on May 14 2001. The shortlist The Love You Promised Me by Silvia Molina Not yet published in the UK, this award-winning novel focuses on a two-day trip the protagonist Marcela, a professional woman in her 40s, takes to reflect on her recently ended affair with a much older married lover. Molina combines emotional shifts in Macela's life with the political situation in Mexico during the country's 1994 elections. The True History of Paradise by Margaret Cezair-Thompson Told from the perspectives of three women, this first novel from Jamaican-born Cezair-Thompson blends history and fiction in a tale of personal identity and family loyalties set against the backdrop of Jamaica's troubled political state in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Blackwater Lightship by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, this story of gay identity, Irish conservatism, family conflict and mortality is told in spare, bleak prose. Three generations of infighting women gather by the bedside of the favourite son, who is dying of Aids. Our Fathers by Andrew O'Hagan This grimly realist tale of Scotland, socialism and family conflict also made the Booker shortlist. The narrator must come to terms with the tragedy of his grandfather, once a social improver with grand dreams and now reduced to desolation. The Clay Machine-Gun by Victor Pelevin Manic satire from the brightest young star of Russian literature. In a parallel life, the hero is a soldier in the 1917 Revolution; in the here and now, he's a patient in a psychiatric clinic, undergoing untrustworthy therapies. A worthy successor to Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita. No Great Mischief by Alastair McLeod In delicately poetic prose imbued with Gaelic cadences, McLeod examines the roots of the clans who fled Scotland for Cape Breton 200 years ago, but whose connection to their long-lost homeland remains profound."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
