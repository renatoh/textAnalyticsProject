The perfect substitutes for 20 common ingredients", "bodyText": "Like life itself, cooking at home is likely to change radically in the coming months. It will be a sanctuary for some and a chore for others, but in an era of lockdowns, we will all sometimes be frustrated by not having this or that ingredient to hand \u2013 and no longer being able to pop out to get it. How you work around that lack of ingredients may determine how well you eat in 2020. To help, we asked various chefs and expert foodies \u2013 the kind of people who improvise every day \u2013 for their tips on how to best substitute in and swap out key ingredients while still creating delicious meals. Salt The simple substitute, reckons Louis Korovilas, the executive head chef at Tavolino in central London, is \u201cdigging out a crushed stock cube from the back of the cupboard\u201d. Alternatively, suggests Stuart Ralston, the chef-owner of Noto and Aizle in Edinburgh: \u201cSoy sauce is a direct replacement that gives better flavour.\u201d Ralston would use soy in everything from stews to, if pushed, a white sauce for fish: \u201cRight now, I can\u2019t think of any broad rule of: \u2018It can\u2019t go in X.\u2019 Go ahead.\u201d Tom Cenci, the chef at the Loyal Tavern in south-east London, flags up salty staple ingredients such as capers, parmesan and anchovies, while Aktar Islam, from Opheem in Birmingham, recommends the brine from tinned pulses: \u201cThere\u2019s a Bajan recipe I do that uses lentils. I never season it, because I just pour the brine in, while cooking the lentils.\u201d Mitshel Ibrahim, the head chef at Ombra in east London, says: \u201cIf it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been busy with in quarantine, most lacto-fermented vegetables have a good amount of salt. They can be added to stews or sauces if you\u2019re looking for a multilayered addition of acidity, salt and funk.\u201d But do you need salt? \u201cI learned from the chef Olivier Roellinger that spices can create a richer flavour profile,\u201d says Apollonia Poil\u00e2ne, the CEO of the French bakery Poil\u00e2ne. \u201cI never suggest salt and pepper in recipes, but rather spice.\u201d Butter \u201cYou can substitute most fats for other fats. You can make biscuits with vegetable or olive oil. Cheaper neutral oils are best. Fancy olive oil would make it a bit funky,\u201d says Ralston. Lemons A few drops of vinegar will lend the required acidic edge to sauces and salads, while Ottolenghi lovers should double-check their spice drawers. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, you may have some sumac you can substitute,\u201d says Paolo Saba, the executive chef at Madera in central London. Given that oranges, lemons and limes go off fairly quickly in the fridge, Richard De La Cruz, the head chef at Arros QD in central London, recommends freezing the juice in ice cube moulds in the freezer, \u201cready to be used when needed\u201d. Esther Miglio, the chef-owner of OWT in Leeds, zests all her lemon rinds, freezes this citrus snow and uses it \u201cto season as you would salt and pepper. Freeze the zest on baking parchment and, once dry, place into a sealed bag. It\u2019ll last six months.\u201d Mayonnaise \u201cUHT soy milk is not just for millennial lattes,\u201d says Alex Claridge from The Wilderness in Birmingham. \u201cIt can be stick-blended into a mayo using vinegar and rapeseed or sunflower oil (125ml soy milk, two teaspoons vinegar, 250ml oil, seasoning). I think I speak for the majority when I say dips are going to be a pivotal part of isolation cuisine and, if you add miso paste, it\u2019s pretty compelling.\u201d Cooking wine \u201cYou can use any alcohol to deglaze pans or make a stew. I\u2019ll be saving my wine for drinking, so I may be experimenting heavily with those dusty bottles in the back of the cupboard,\u201d says Sven-Hanson Britt from Oxeye in central London. \u201cI\u2019m 100% confident that \u2018chicken \u00e0 la Baileys\u2019 is going to be delicious.\u201d In braises, stews and ragouts, Gizzi Erskine, the food writer and chef at The Nitery in central London, would replace wine with a gastrique. \u201cIt\u2019s a technique of acidulating caramelised sugar to boost the balance of sweet and sour umami in a dish. I do a shortcut at home of one tablespoon of sugar melted into two tablespoons of vinegar. I use sherry vinegar, but use whatever you have. Reduce that down to about one tablespoon of syrup and add it to the dish. It\u2019s amazing something simple can do so much.\u201d Flour Most baking requires flour. But if you are using it to thicken a soup or a sauce, you have options. \u201cAdding a few slices of potato during cooking helps thicken a stew,\u201d says Ryan Blackburn, the chef at the Old Stamp House in Ambleside, Cumbria. As does rice, says Saba: \u201cGrind it into powder in a food processor and substitute.\u201d Si Toft, the chef-owner at The Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd, has a more 70s suggestion: \u201cI\u2019ll get chucked out of chefs club for this, but Smash is quality. Use it instead of flour to hold fish cakes or thicken a sauce. It\u2019s basically tasteless. Disclaimer: I don\u2019t use Smash at work. I use gluten-free flour, which is just trendy Smash.\u201d For a b\u00e9chamel, says Britt, use \u201cdry bread crusts, biscuits, crackers or anything of that ilk and crush them into a fine powder\u201d, then mix that with butter to create a roux. More generally, do not waste bread, advises Rachel Stockley, the chef at Baraxturi in Ramsbottom, near Bury: \u201cIt can be stretched out as breadcrumbs for topping oven bakes or as croutons to bulk out salads. I like to blend torn stale bread into soups to thicken them, like our garlic soup. It is four main ingredients: chicken stock, a garlic bulb, bread, olive oil.\u201d Cheese \u201cIn dire times,\u201d says Claridge, \u201cumami-rich yeast flakes provide a passable substitute for parmesan cheese in sauces, and as a topping.\u201d Vinegar Britt recommends retaining and/or repurposing liquid from a jar of something pickled, such as ginger or cornichons: \u201cEven high-acidity apple juice will do a similar job to vinegar in your cooking.\u201d Kombucha fans may be interested to know, says Ibrahim, that, by using a scoby (a fermentation-starting combination of bacteria and yeast), \u201cyou can quite easily turn an unfinished bottle of wine into vinegar.\u201d Sugar \u201cYou can use maple syrup, honey or golden syrup pretty much anywhere you\u2019d find sugar,\u201d says Ralston. You could also use waste syrup from tinned fruit, intensify sweetness in desserts by adding a pinch of cinnamon (a tip from Lina Stores\u2019 head chef, Masha Rener), or deploy vegetables with a higher sugar content (parsnips, beetroots, carrots, sweet potatoes, courgette) in your baking as a way to build in sweetness. This will take trial and error, however. As Poil\u00e2ne points out: \u201cGenerally, you can halve the sugar content of recipes without affecting their chemical balance.\u201d Rice \u201cLook for alternatives: ancient grains and pulses such as pearl barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat, millet and lentils,\u201d advises Irina Georgescu, the author of the cookbook Carpathia. Fresh garlic Chefs used to shudder at the very idea of using dried garlic granules. A man made for these febrile times, Toft takes a more pragmatic line: \u201cAt home, where we don\u2019t get through the same quantity, dried garlic is brilliant. Also, I have a bottle of oil I\u2019ve been topping up since about 1997 that\u2019s got a load of leftover garlic cloves in it. I use it when I\u2019m browning meat, rather than messing around with fresh garlic.\u201d (Note, though, that the incorrect preparation and storage of garlic-infused oil can give rise to botulism. Thoroughly research the process online before proceeding.) Meat Without getting bogged down in the effectiveness or, in this crisis, the availability of meat substitutes (tofu, jackfruit etc), what you certainly can do with dishes in the cottage-pie-to-ragout sphere is bulk out what meat you have. \u201cYou could go Scottish and stretch ground meat with oats and suet,\u201d says the chef Nina Matsunaga, from the Black Bull in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cOr mince or dice any veg and mix it through.\u201d Toft suggests lengthening bolognese sauce with bread: \u201cI put Marmite through mine at home, because I prefer the flavour over stock cubes, so do that as well. It won\u2019t fool [the renowned Italian chef] Massimo Bottura, but it\u2019s tasty and packed with vitamins.\u201d Barley, chickpeas and lentils will do a similar job \u2013 or, says Claridge, go full vegan: \u201cWith the world increasingly dark, it was only a matter of time before you had to summon seitan. Add it to curries and stews. It\u2019s tinned and, I guarantee, avoided most panic-buying lists.\u201d Pesto \u201cAt work, I make a pesto every day from blanched kale, parsley stalks, pumpkin seeds and garlic oil. It\u2019s beautiful and basically free,\u201d says Toft. Georgescu is also a kale pesto fan: \u201cThere\u2019s no cheese needed and it can be used on top of soups, pasta, bread and eggs.\u201d Pasta The shortage of spaghetti has made the idea of using a spiraliser to craft courgetti or other vegetable noodles less a \u201cclean eating\u201d fashion statement and more a necessity. If you crave the real thing, says Officina 00\u2019s chef Elia Sebregondi, you can make a rudimentary pasta, such as the tiny, Sugar Puff-shaped cavatelli, with flour and water: \u201cUse some semolina flour, which has a lot more protein and nutritional value.\u201d \u201cFor a little more deliciousness,\u201d says Britt, \u201cmake some fresh sp\u00e4tzle or eastern European-style hand-cut noodles, which cook like pasta.\u201d You will need eggs and some patience; for a primer, see Felicity Cloake\u2019s How to cook the perfect \u2026 on the subject. Potatoes \u201cOther big root vegetables can work as well, such as celeriac or swede, and can often offer better flavour,\u201d says Cenci. Britt, who points out that spuds will keep for months if left in the dark in a sack or other breathable, dry container, agrees: \u201cRoasted jerusalem artichokes, swede boulang\u00e8re or carrot and cauliflower mash all give you that comforting texture and, arguably, have more flavour.\u201d Stock cubes \u201cIn a chicken tray bake or a casserole, beer is a great alternative. It often brings more flavour \u2013 certainly richness and sweetness,\u201d says Stockley. Matsunaga takes a similar but alcohol-free approach: \u201cAt home, if we have no fresh stock, we use Marmite, Worcestershire sauce, miso or tomato puree to add umami.\u201d Eggs Will the aquafaba cult now cross over? Chefs love the viscous water that tinned chickpeas sit in and its ability to double as egg whites. \u201cTwo tablespoons equals one egg; a 400g can is the equivalent of six egg whites,\u201d enthuses Ricky Evans, the executive chef at Milroy\u2019s in London. Toft is another convert: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to understand the science, but I do vegan meringues whisked to peaks, 100g of sugar to a tin\u2019s worth of liquid, and they\u2019re pretty good.\u201d Google can provide you with numerous other replacements for eggs in baking, from milk to fruit purees, depending on how you are using them (leavening agent, binding etc). \u201cMost people don\u2019t know you can make a beautiful egg-free cake,\u201d says Roberta d\u2019Elia, the head chef at the meal-delivery company Pasta Evangelists. Use 50ml of milk or 70g of plain yoghurt to replace the moisture one egg would normally impart. Interestingly, adds Ibrahim, pigs\u2019 blood \u201ccoagulates in a very similar way to eggs\u201d. Sour cream \u201cIn a food processor, blend a handful of cashew nuts, the juice of a lemon, sea salt and a few tablespoons of water until super-smooth. You won\u2019t believe how it resembles sour cream,\u201d says Saba. Onion \u201cIf I don\u2019t have onions, I always use bacon. The taste is very similar when you cook it until crispy,\u201d says D\u2019Elia. Flavour enhancers If herbs become scarce, spice racks run low and you are out of the usual enhancers (anchovies, soy, Marmite etc), there are novel ways to punch up flavour. \u201cI vouch for celery salt to boost umami in almost anything,\u201d says Erskine. Ben Tish, of Norma in central London, rates brown sauce or ketchup as \u201cconcentrated replacements for wine, vinegar and salt in ragouts and stews. They contain an array of spices, have bags of flavour and depth, and they also add colour, particularly brown sauce, if you are short on gravy granules.\u201d More challenging is Ibrahim\u2019s frugal suggestion of saving whey from bagged mozzarella, bringing it to a rapid boil, then simmering it until it caramelises: \u201cThe result is a punchy, acidic elixir with a very strong, meaty taste that can be used as a flavour enhancer.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 April 2020 to include information on garlic and botulism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
