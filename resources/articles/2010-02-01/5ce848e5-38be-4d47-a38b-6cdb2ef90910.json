I used to meet a politician there called Saeed, a very nice guy. One day he said to me: \"You should come with me and you won't believe your eyes.\" We walked half a mile up the ridge behind the mosque to his house. Because of its position, you could see the whole city. It was a wonderful sight: you could see the mosque, the Red Fort, the old city. It was late summer and people were spending their afternoons on rooftops: young people flying kites, that sort of thing. I started shooting and kept going for two or three hours. But, fascinating though the panorama was, I thought something was missing. I couldn't connect with it in a human way. Then, as the sun was setting, I walked down a staircase from the roof, and saw this young woman doing namaz, praying, in Saeed's cousin's house. I took four or five quick shots. I was lucky: it all came together, the light, the clouds, the landscape and the figure. I've never actually met the woman I photographed, but after the picture won an award, I gave a print and a copy of my book to Saeed. I know the whole family was delighted with how it turned out. I used to work for newspapers \u2013 until I realised that daily stories died a daily death. I felt an image must stay alive, live for itself, be timeless. Stuff in papers doesn't last. We have a beautiful word in Hindi, darshan, that sums this up. Literally, it means \"seeing\", but it's more seeing in totality, seeing the connections between things. Photography for me is a darshan of my country, and this picture is a particularly magical and intense experience. India is my canvas, my world. CV Born: Jhang, India (now Pakistan), 1942.
