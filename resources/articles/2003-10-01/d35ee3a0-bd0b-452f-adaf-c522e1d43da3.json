If anything could be gleaned from this mindless tedium it was that it provided justification of what David Moyes had been insisting all week - for Everton, life without the suspended teenager is worth considerably more than a paltry \u00a335m. For all the honourable huff and puff on display in Rooney's absence, it will be the fluffed chances and miserable misplaced passes which nag this morning. The overriding memory will not be of a clean sheet and a point gained from the mish-mash, but of David Prutton comically blazing the ball over the Park End stand and out of the ground, or of James McFadden knocking a shot wide of a gaping goal. \"It wasn't great, but I'm looking at the positives,\" offered Moyes, delving deep. The Everton manager built up expectations on Merseyside last season with a seventh-place finish and while those in the stands remain sympathetic even after this vapid showing, reviving those heady days is proving to be problematic. \"It's not so much with the fans, but with myself and the players,\" he added. \"Maybe we're not fulfilling how we see ourselves performing.\" They might have done had McFadden, presented with Thomas Gravesen's centre which by-passed the muddle in the centre, not panicked and snatched at his shot. Or even when Tony Hibbert sent Francis Jeffers to the byline and his cross was palmed by Antti Niemi on to Steve Watson's head, four yards out. The midfielder, scorer of a hat-trick on his last appearance at Goodison, stooped then stared dumbfounded as his attempt trickled wide of the near-post. Not that Southampton deserved to leave pointless. Without the suspended Kevin Phillips, sat in the stand and who greeted the final whistle with a look of bored disgust etched across his brow, they were the more cohesive side for most of the match, though they could muster little from the shambles either. As a result of Phillips' dismissal against Middlesbrough and Rooney's tendency to accumulate yellow cards, the match was endured painfully by 35,775 numbed spectators. Phillips' replacement, Brett Ormerod, had a point-blank shot turned away by Nigel Martyn, whose own horrendously sliced clearance fell to James Beattie on the right touchline only for the striker to lob beyond the leaping Hibbert on the line but narrowly over. Those missed chances punctured a desperate first half. Thereafter, the visitors dominated possession without ever seriously threatening to eke out an advantage. Beattie, more effective than in last week's Steaua Bucharest defeat, may have headed on to the roof of the net - where Prutton preferred the stand - but it is now a month since the Saints last scored a Premiership goal. \"That sums up our season; when we get into the final third the quality lets us down,\" said Gordon Strachan, whose team still loiter in an encouraging seventh place despite their shot-shy showing. \"It's like a golfer with a six-yard putt, or a tennis player with a tricky volley over the net. \"It's about you and pressure. At the moment, the pressure's winning. But that's the difference between being good and great: we are good, but we are not great. As for David Prutton's effort, that was a cracker, that.\" Which is considerably more than can be said for this match.
