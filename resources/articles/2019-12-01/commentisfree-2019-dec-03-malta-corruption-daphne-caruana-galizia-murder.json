For decades, a pair of political machines \u2013 the Labour and Nationalist parties \u2013 have operated with impunity on the island. But in 2013 the corruption went into overdrive. After 15 years out of power, the Labour party took office, and within months, public assets were being sold off to Azerbaijan. The new government also licensed a collection of financial laundromats masquerading as banks, just as the island became a haven for ever greater flows of dirty cash, and people shuttled their own fortunes away to offshore holdings in Panama and Dubai. One person was watching obsessively, however. Daphne Caruana Galizia was Malta\u2019s most dogged journalist. For years, her blog, Running Commentary, put these scandals on full display for everyone on the island to see, exposing the underlying rot in Malta\u2019s supposed prosperity. Caruana Galizia\u2019s courage led to her assassination in October 2017, killed by a car bomb. It put her alongside Hrant Dink in Turkey and Anna Politkovskaya in Russia \u2013 journalists murdered for exposing corruption, only this time near the heart of Europe in a state that continued to pass itself off as a success story. For two years now almost everyone on Malta has been demanding to know who ordered Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder \u2013 though the Labour party she routinely excoriated has shown scant interest in pursuing the case. It treated her assassination as an inconvenience \u2013 why do foreigners keep asking about this? \u2013 and an opportunity: it became a chance to discredit the journalist\u2019s allegations now that she was no longer around to defend them. Visiting Valletta in early 2018, I watched as public sector workers were sent every morning to a shrine to Caruana Galizia to sweep away the previous night\u2019s assemblage of flowers and posters in her honour: \u201cYou killed Daphne to escape jail!\u201d signs said. \u201cDaphne was right!\u201d When I attempted to interview the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, his press secretary told me it could only happen on two conditions: I could not ask about financial corruption or about Caruana Galizia. For months, the three men accused of planting and detonating the fatal car bomb would not so much as utter their names aloud to a judge. All three have pleaded not guilty. But last year one did start talking: he explained that he\u2019d been recruited to kill Caruana Galizia by a taxi driver offering \u20ac150,000. This taxi driver, Melvin Theuma, was eventually arrested in mid-November, and when questioned, accused a prominent Maltese casino magnate, Yorgen Fenech, of hiring him to arrange the killing. Theuma was subsequently given a presidential pardon. Fenech, meanwhile, pointed to the complicity, if not outright participation, of the highest levels of the state. He was not just a shadowy businessman \u2013 Fenech was also heavily involved in Labour\u2019s financial schemes. Shortly after taking office, Konrad Mizzi, the tourism minister \u2013 who had been named in the Panama Papers \u2013 and Keith Schembri, Muscat\u2019s chief of staff, had set up two Panamanian companies that had connections to a Dubai trust, which was alleged to be owned by Fenech. Fenech has now been charged with conspiracy to murder \u2013 he has pleaded not guilty. Fenech also sought a presidential pardon but it was declined. But in the past week his revelations prompted new speculation, as he attempted to implicate Schembri as a co-conspirator in the murder plot. Schembri was questioned and then released by police; he denies all allegations against him. The prime minister Muscat has been increasingly embattled, denying one allegation after the next. In the past month he has taken it upon himself to become Malta\u2019s police chief and national spokesman. He has handed out certain presidential pardons, while mysteriously withholding others. It was difficult enough to imagine Valletta running a credible investigation into Caruana Galizia\u2019s death using a judiciary and police force lined with Muscat\u2019s partisans. Now the game is downright rigged. Initial reports claimed that the prime minister was resigning from office. This is not strictly true: he has said he will remain in power until Labour elects a new leader in January, potentially giving him time to lay the foundations for the exoneration of anyone around him who is connected to the case. But at play is a deeper problem \u2013 something Caruana Galizia grasped more acutely than anyone. So concentrated was Labour\u2019s corruption, it is unthinkable that anyone involved doesn\u2019t possess compromising information on others in the party. Perhaps this prevents people in the party from turning on each other \u2013 or maybe it becomes a form of mutually assured destruction, with the testimony of any witness heralding the collapse of the whole cabal. Where does this lead? There is little talk in Valletta \u2013 or Brussels \u2013 of actually dismantling the rogue financialisation of the island or halting the open flows of suspect capital \u2013 abetted by a porous banking structure and tax incentives that elevated foreign corporations over Maltese citizens. Brussels has still never solved how to integrate certain \u201csmall states\u201d in the wider European project \u2013 Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Malta. They exist either as secretive finance hubs or homes of reactionary forms of rule \u2013 or, in Malta\u2019s case, a bit of both. The island now stands as a test case for whether the EU can ever successfully incorporate such a state \u2013 one that, until recently, had a robust working class \u2013 or whether these countries are bound to remain the problem children of the continent forever. And after all that Malta has endured in the past two years, it is hard to imagine a worse fate for the country than to simply revert to the same rotten and discredited two-party system of rule. The question for its citizens, once they get answers to those surrounding Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder, is what they might ever hope to put in its place. \u2022 Alexander Clapp is a journalist based in Athens"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
