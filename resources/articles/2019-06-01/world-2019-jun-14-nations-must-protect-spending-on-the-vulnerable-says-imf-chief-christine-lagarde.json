Announcing the change of approach in an interview with the Guardian, Christine Lagarde said it was now politically incorrect to argue against the impact of social spending on growth and stability. The IMF, she said, had been through a process of introspection after being criticised in the past for imposing anti-poor spending cuts on governments facing financial crises. Lagarde said the new stance was the result of demands from the IMF\u2019s member countries and internal soul-searching on the part of her organisation. \u201cThere are more members concerned about inequality \u2013 which is excessive in many areas of the world \u2013 and how to remedy it. Social spending can be a mitigating factor. \u201cThere are quite a lot of people looking for work; a lot of people coming into the labour market. There will be more retirees and they will require social spending in terms of health. Lagarde said the fund\u2019s research had shown that tackling inequality helped countries grow faster and that there was a consensus in the organisation that social spending was critical for the overall health of economies. \u201cThere is a consensus in the organisation that social spending can be macro critical. We have surveyed all the mission chiefs and asked them whether social spending was likely to be macro critical and were happily surprised that 80% of them said it was.\u201d Lagarde said the IMF\u2019s watchdog \u2013 the Internal Evaluation Office \u2013 had identified room for improvement. \u201cIt found that we were doing a lot of work in this area but it was not consistent and not fully endorsed throughout the organisation. It wanted a more systematic approach.\u201d The fund\u2019s increased concern for social spending comes at a time when there have been signs of the global economy slowing. \u201cIt is too soft, too low and politics is interfering too much with the economic mechanism and that is frustrating.\u201d However, the IMF\u2019s MD said the new strategy was not a response to current events: \u201cIt has been on my mind for some time and in the works for two and a half years.\u201d She revealed that there had been some pushback against the new approach by fiscal hardliners on the IMF\u2019s board. \u201cThere is always a group of countries that are questioning the non-orthodox definition of macro-criticality. But it has become politically incorrect to argue against the impact of social spending on health and education.\u201d Asked whether she had learned lessons from Greece, where the country had to accept harsh terms in return for a succession of financial bailouts and its economy shrunk by more than a quarter, Lagarde said it had been Europe rather than the IMF that had pushed for draconian cuts. \u201cThere was a lot imposed and there were many sacrifices. We were not advocating the kind of hardship that was imposed.\u201d Lagarde said the new approach was the result of consultation. \u201cWe went outside the organisation. We took the pulse of the membership, of NGOs and academics, a range of external actors and influences, people in the know. \u201cWe now have a framework both for our programmes and for policy guidance, which has the approval of the board.\u201d She added that the IMF would be looking at the impact of spending programmes on growth and stability. \u201cIs social spending going to be meaningful and relevant for those two purposes? Where a country is undergoing a programme we will be paying more attention than we did in the past to social spending.\u201d More so than in the past, the IMF would take into account what needed to be spent on young people, single-parent families or senior citizens on low incomes. However, she warned that the fund was not going to abandon its concern for good fiscal housekeeping. \u201cWhen a country\u2019s debt is out of control and it is spending without restraint we will still be going to focus on debt sustainability.\u201d Lagarde said the IMF had incorporated its new approach in its programme for Argentina. While it was up to individual countries whether they protected social spending, Lagarde said she was hopeful that member states would notice the difference. \u201cResearch has shown the link between inequality and growth. That\u2019s why the social spending strategy has been adopted.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
