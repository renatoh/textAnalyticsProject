The private remarks by Hampton that directors had breached their \"fiduciary responsibilities\" are disclosed barely a week after the City regulator controversially shut its investigation into what went wrong at RBS. The FSA's decision, revealed by the Guardian, was greeted with astonishment in the financial community and means no action will be taken against the bank or any of its former directors, including former chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin. The cables sent from the US embassy in London, report that Hampton told a visiting delegation of politicians that one of the biggest mistakes made by the bank was its takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro just as the credit crunch began in the autumn of 2007. This acquisition left the bank with a wafer-thin capital cushion and ultimately led to the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout of the bank in October 2008. Lawyers said Hampton's reported remarks could be crucial for any shareholders trying to bring legal action for the losses they sustained on their shares during the \u00a312bn cash call made on shareholders in the spring of 2008 \u2013 and should be of interest to the FSA. Asked about the importance of a fiduciary responsibility, Simon Morris of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna said: \"A fiduciary duty is about honesty. Shareholders give directors the power to run a company and a breach of that fiduciary duty is a reflection of a lapse in that honesty. A breach is also likely to be of interest to the FSA if it is an FSA regulated firm.\" On 2 December the FSA said it could not find any director who had behaved with \"a lack of integrity\", nor had it found \"a failure of governance on the part of the board.\" The cable reports Hampton as acknowledging that RBS had made \"several enormous mistakes\". \"Top among them was its heavy exposure in the US subprime market and the bank's purchase of ABN Amro, which occurred at the height of the market and without RBS doing proper due diligence prior to the purchase. The board of directors never questioned this purchase, which Hampton termed a failure of their fiduciary responsibilities,\" the cable said. The conversation, recorded in a cable sent on 11 September 2009, followed a meeting between the RBS chairman, who was nine months into his new role, and Democrats Paul Kanjorski and Luis Gutierrez, and Republican Scott Garrett. When it was forced to admit last week it had shut its investigation into RBS, the FSA concluded the mistakes were the result of \"bad\" decisions rather than dishonesty. Hampton's private remarks to the US delegation may add to the pressure on the FSA to provide more details about why it closed its investigation. The RBS chairman declined to comment on someone's else report of a meeting. Earlier this month he told the Guardian that \"big bad business judgments\" rather than \"acts of criminal vandalism\" had caused the near-collapse of RBS. Other cables sent from the London embassy back to Washington also disclose conversations between senior US officials and RBS staff. One meeting took place at RBS HQ in Gogarburn, near Edinburgh. Mark Tokola, acting deputy chief of mission, comments that the 350,000 square foot building based on a 78-acre site is an illustration of \"the ambition of its leaders and its many vacant offices a sign of its new reality\". Tokola reports in a cable dated 6 May 2009 his meeting with senior economic advisor Stephen Boyle. He records Boyle as discussing the takeover of ABN Amro and saying \"proper due diligence on the purchase was not done and the market timing could not have been worse\". \"RBS executives had rigorously (if not blindly, Boyle added) pursed a vision of becoming one of the leading global banks, and this lead to disastrous acquisitions,\" the cable said. In comments after the meeting, Tokola said: \"While the executives were chagrined about some of RBS's acquisitions, they still seemed reluctant to acknowledge there might have been other missteps\". He noted Goodwin has \"only admitted that the purchase of ABN Amro was a mistake\". \"In the public's eye, RBS has a lot more explaining to do,\" he concluded. The cables also report that Lord Turner expressed concern about mistakes made by directors on bank boards in the run up to the taxpayer bailouts, and that Turner regarded \"too little oversight by boards of directors\" as one of the causes of the financial crisis. \"Negligent boards of directors bore much of the responsibility for the crisis, he argued, failing to provide oversight or check risky activity,\" the cable said. In a meeting with Representative Garrett, Turner agreed that bankers' pay was turning into a \"red herring\". \"Bonuses, he said, had not been at the heart of the crisis, but the political pressure was mounting to place limits on bonuses,\" the cable said. By the time of this conversation in September 2009, the FSA had published a code on pay which demanded that bonuses be deferred over three years or more and allowed banks to be able to \"claw back\" bonuses paid if performance turned sour in later years. Gordon Brown's government demanded that major banks sign up to the code and one cable shows the pressure exerted by the City minister, Lord Myners, to win support from international banks. One cable dated 3 November 2009 recalled a meeting between Myners and eight major banks a month earlier, on 14 October in which the minister had convinced the banks to adhere to the code a year earlier than they had wanted to. \"Prior to the meeting with Lord Myners JPMC (JP Morgan Chase) and other firms understood from the Financial Services Authority that they were being asked to sign on to changes effective 2010. Only at the meeting with Lord Myners were they told the FSA rules would also apply to all 2009 bonuses. JPMC signed on, believing it did not have another choice. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs echoed this view.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
