The Cumbria-based newspaper and radio group will provide a \"locally focused music and information station\" called 2DayFM, serving Warwick and the surrounding area including Kenilworth and Leamington Spa. Mr Schoonmaker, who resigned from Kiss and Magic parent Emap at the beginning of 2004, led a bid by Australian investment bank Macquarie. Laser Broadcasting's Warwick Local Radio also bid for the FM licence. 2DayFM will have a potential adult audience of around 100,000 people. In a statement, Ofcom said it expected it to begin \"at the earliest opportunity\" and must begin broadcasting within the next two years. CN Group has eight radio stations including Belfast City Beat, The Bay in Morecambe and Stratford-upon-Avon's The Bear. The group recently won a new licence for Banbury FM , which will launch later this year. Ofcom recently rejected a request by CN Group to change the format of its Coventry station, Kix 96. It wanted to switch it from a chart and urban music station to a golden oldies station. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
