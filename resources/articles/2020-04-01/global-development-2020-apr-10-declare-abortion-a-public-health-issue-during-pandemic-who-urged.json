In guidance notes issued last week, the WHO advised all governments to identify and prioritise the health services each believed essential, listing reproductive health services as an example. Clinical guidelines published by the organisation last month said that women\u2019s right to sexual and reproductive healthcare \u201cshould be respected irrespective of Covid-19 status, including access to contraception and safe abortion\u201d. Simon Cooke, the CEO of Marie Stopes International (MSI), said a stronger pronouncement by the WHO would be \u201cimmensely helpful as it would help countries to see abortion from a public health perspective\u201d. There have been growing calls for governments to protect abortion services during the crisis. On Wednesday, 100 NGOs issued a joint statement imploring European states to find new ways to help women access services during lockdown, such as through online consultations and, as introduced in the UK introduced last month, by allowing them to take abortion pills at home. In the US, the Center for Reproductive Rights has filed emergency lawsuits in five states to thwart moves by legislators to ban abortion during the pandemic. \u201cFor us and for women who have unplanned pregnancies, it\u2019s a very worrying time and [abortion] is time critical,\u201d said Cooke. Last week, MSI warned that up 9.5 million women and girls would not access family planning services this year because of the pandemic, which could result in as many as 3m unintended pregnancies and 2.7m unsafe abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the majority of abortions are done in the first trimester, which makes them extremely safe. As countries go into lockdown or mobility is reduced, women will have to wait longer and the procedure becomes more complex,\u201d said Cooke. \u201cIn the UK that\u2019s one thing, where we have the infrastructure to deal with late terminations, but in many countries we operate in that\u2019s not an option. Therefore it becomes critical and there\u2019s a risk of unsafe abortion and complications.\u201d He said abortion was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to save lives. Unsafe abortionsaccount for between 4% and 13% of maternal deaths. Dr Jeanne Conry, president elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, said \u201cAbortion access is critical. Women need access or we will see more unintended pregnancies, more maternal mortality and more unsafe abortion,\u201d said Conry. \u201cAbortion is not an elective procedure, it\u2019s an essential part of women\u2019s healthcare. It\u2019s absolutely time dependent.\u201d She said telemedicine, where women can speak to doctors over the internet, was \u201ccritical right now\u201d . On Thursday, the International Planned Parenthood Federation said 23 of its member associations have had to reduce their abortion services because of Covid-19, with 5,600 clinics across 64 countries already closed. There were also reports of shortages of contraceptives and HIV medicines. \u201cThese figures show that millions of women and girls across the world now face an even greater challenge in trying to take care of their own health and bodies,\u201d said the IPPF\u2019s director general, Dr Alvaro Bermejo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
