Amid signs that households are becoming more willing to spend, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it expected national output to rise by 1.2% in 2013 and 1.8% in 2014 \u2013 an increase of 0.3% for both years. However, NIESR said there was still a case for the government taking steps to boost investment. Friday's report follows an upbeat survey of manufacturing from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply and Markit, which showed business conditions for industry at their most buoyant in more than two years. In the City, the stock market moved higher after better-than-anticipated news from the US manufacturing sector pushed shares on Wall Street to a record high. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee adopted a wait-and-see approach \u2013 leaving official interest rates at 0.5% and its asset purchases under the quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. Next week, Threadneedle Street will provide guidance to the financial markets on the length of time it plans to leave monetary policy ultra-loose, with the City confident that the current regime will last at least until 2015. NIESR said: \"We have revised up our GDP forecasts by 0.3 percentage points in both 2013 and 2014, to 1.2% and 1.8% per annum, respectively. The main cause of the improvement in the economic growth outlook is a rise in the prospects for consumer spending growth. This increased contribution from consumer spending is at the expense of household saving, rather than a consequence of rising real disposable incomes.\" Even so, NIESR added, there would still be substantial spare capacity in the economy as a result of the UK's slow recovery from its deepest postwar recession. \"In such an environment, an acceleration in demand growth should be possible without stimulating inflationary pressures \u2026 policy measures to boost investment, both public and private, would benefit the economy in the short and long term.\" A second group of forecasters, Fathom Consulting, also said it anticipated growth of 1.2% this year \u2013 double the chancellor's forecast in the budget \u2013 rising to 2% in 2014. \"That would represent by far the strongest performance since the crisis began. But far from reflecting a rebalanced economy, we detect a return to the bad habits of old. We expect growth to be driven by increased consumption on the back of rising household debt, as both investment and net trade remain weak. Rebalancing has been abandoned in pursuit of 'growth at any cost',\" said Fathom. The monthly survey of industry from CIPS/Markit showed a sharp increase in orders and production and continued the upward trend into a fifth month. After suffering badly during the recession and the UK's sluggish recovery, the Purchasing Managers' Index \u2013 a barometer of manufacturing's strength \u2013 rose from 52.9 in June to 54.6 in July, with any reading above 50 indicating an expanding sector. Companies reported stronger demand both at home and abroad, with firms selling consumer goods experiencing the strongest trading conditions. Manufacturers ran down their stocks to meet demand and expanded their workforces for the third month. Industry reported that inflationary pressure remained weak. New export orders increased at their fastest pace in two years, reflecting higher sales to China, Australia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mexico, Russia and the US. There was also an improvement in exports to the eurozone, where the manufacturing PMI moved above 50 for the first time in two years last month, from 48.8 in June to 50.3 in July, and raised hopes that the single currency area will return to growth in the second half of 2013 following an 18-month recession. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, said: \"The much-vaunted 'march of the makers' has finally materialised with the UK manufacturing sector's output growth hitting a 29-month high in July. Exports have been critical to this success, but it is the broad-based nature of the sector's performance which endorses the view [that] we are on track for solid and accelerated growth in the coming months.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
