PSG won Tuesday\u2019s first leg with a dominant display. Pogba was sent off for a second booking towards the end, ruling him out of the return on 6 March. Draxler, asked whether this was a big advantage to the French champions, said: \u201cYes, I think so because for me Paul is the best player of Manchester United. A very important player for the team and you could see he is fantastic. That is why we are very happy he will not play the second leg.\u201d PSG were able to beat United with ease despite the absence of Neymar and Edinson Cavani. \u201cIf two players like this are missing, everyone is talking about that, that is normal,\u201d Draxler said. \u201cFor sure, we are better if Cavani and Neymar are not missing. But we have an excellent team even without them. It is not easy to come to Old Trafford and win and that is why we are very happy and proud and we know we have to finish it in the second leg.\u201d Goals from Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 secured the victory. \u201cWe are happy about the result but also the way we were playing,\u201d Draxler said. \u201cWe were very confident, especially in the second half and deserved to win. \u201cI think they started very well so the pressure was not easy for us but in the second half we were more confident and the pressure from Man United was a little bit less. That helped us to improve our game so we found some space on the pitch and we used that very well.\u201d Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Manchester United after two bottles were thrown from the stands towards \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda during Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s win at Old Trafford on Tuesday. Di Mar\u00eda, a former United player, picked up a beer bottle and pretended to drink from it. Later a bottle of water was hurled at him and United can expect a fine when the case is dealt with by Uefa on 28 February. The club have also been charged with having stairways blocked, while PSG face a series of charges over the conduct of their fans: setting off fireworks, throwing objects, acts of damage and crowd disturbance. An item landed at the feet of United\u2019s Luke Shaw in the first half."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
