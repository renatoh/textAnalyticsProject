I wanted to become an advocate for deaf people. Eventually, I became a debt caseworker through the Financial Inclusion Fund and training was provided by the Money Advice Trust. Do most deaf people have problems accessing debt advice? Most deaf people don't know where to start looking for advice. Many of us can't talk to people on the telephone to ask about problems and we can't meet most people face to face without a sign language interpreter. Should there be more deaf debt advisers? There should be more deaf advisers in practically every customer-service area. Deaf advisers can also advise hearing clients through sign language interpreters. Should there be more public services for deaf people? Yes. Most public services either don't bother with deaf people or waste money on services that don't meet our needs. What needs to change? Society [needs] to adapt to us, rather than us to them. Society can learn to sign or use sign language interpreters. We can't learn to hear. Has the Disability Discrimination Act changed things for deaf people? The current DDA legislation is flawed, and too many companies abuse it and refuse to comply. The DDA has helped enforce better services from councils, government and private business, but it is nowhere near enough. What is the most difficult thing about your job? Just the time it takes to get anything done. Does giving advice come naturally to you? Giving advice is something that always comes naturally. Probably through a lot of socialising. Has the job changed your attitude to money? It has made me realise how many financial companies actively encourage people to borrow money they can't afford to. Are we a nation of overspenders? We are definitely a nation of \"want it now and pay for it later\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
