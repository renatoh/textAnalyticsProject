In a nation where 40% of the population describe themselves as conservative, just three people out of a thousand raised their hands. As Haidt went on to note in his talk (audio &amp; slides here): This is a statistically impossible lack of diversity. [...] Anywhere in the world that social psychologists see women or minorities underrepresented by a factor of two or three, our minds jump to discrimination as the explanation. But when we find out that conservatives are underrepresented among us by a factor of more than 100, suddenly everyone finds it quite easy to generate alternate explanations. In building the case that anti-Conservative discrimination is a problem, Haidt went on to share the testimony of 'non-liberal' graduate students in psychology he had spoken to, controversially comparing their experiences with those of gay students in the 1980s. While anecdotal, their stories are fascinating. One wrote: Until about a year ago, I was very quiet about my political opinions... I often didn't understand the political jokes made by my colleagues... the people making the jokes thought that we all felt the same way, and I certainly wasn't going to reveal that I disagree. That would have been much too awkward. While another felt their difference from others would impact their publication prospects: \"I consider myself very middle of the road politically: A social liberal but fiscal conservative. Nonetheless, I avoid the topic of politics around work... Given what I've read of the literature, I am certain any research I conducted in political psychology would provide contrary findings and, therefore, go unpublished.\" Regardless of the merits of that belief, it seems reasonable to assume that the overwhelming liberal-left bias in the field could have a negative impact on at least some of those who work or study in it. So it's worth noting that a similar bias exists in online science writing. When I last wrote about women in science blogging, I turned to my followers on Twitter to crowd-source a list. We came up with 131 names in a couple of days, and I could probably have added another fifty by now if I had the time to spend updating the list. In contrast, asking people on Twitter to name conservative science bloggers on two or three occasions over the last few months left tumbleweed drifting across my screen. On the last attempt, three names dribbled into my inbox. Reality isn't the only thing with a liberal bias then. But does it matter? Well maybe, because the ability of someone to communicate to an audience depends on their ability to share some sort of common ground, beyond simply 'language'. In my mid-twenties I started listening to Simon and Garfunkel a lot more than I used to. It's no coincidence that Paul Simon was also in his twenties when he wrote some of their greatest hits. I had always understood the words, but the understanding of what they really meant, didn't arrive until I was closer to him in age and outlook, and shared the same sense of dislocation that he wrote about. Simon's writing - like any writing - relies on mutual understanding with his audience to give it meaning. Take the following passage from The Boxer: Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job But I get no offers, Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there To really get the full picture here you need to know that \"Seventh Avenue\" is a street in New York. You need to be able to empathize with the plight of the working class in big cities in the 1960s, and with the loneliness of a man so who turns to prostitutes just so he can feel some sort of human contact. You need to be aware that \"workman's wages\" is one of several biblical references in the song placed to highlight the contrast between what the boy came from and where the man is now. In other words, Simon's ability to communicate with an audience relies on having some common ground with them - similar attitudes or memes or cultural frames of reference. The same is true for anyone trying to share their thoughts, feelings or ideas with others. Which brings us back to Haidt's talk. In it, he makes the point that reducing partisanship in science can result in scientists and science advocates \"more credibility in Washington and with the public.\" To reach the broadest possible audience, we need to be prepared to take messages across the politicial divide. There are plenty of examples of this around if you look for them. A lot of people probably equate right-wing American Christians with climate denial, but groups like the Evangelical Climate Iniative are committed to action on climate change, and can probably do more to influence the debate among sections of the Christian right than any number of liberal activists. Similarly, Conservatives in the UK have taken a different approach to selling climate policy than those on the left, with a greater focus on things like energy security. If you want to sell energy policy to the Daily Mail brigade, you could probably do worse than: \"You may not believe in climate change, but do you like having to get your energy from Arabs?\" And last year, the Taxpayers' Alliance waded in to the homeopathy debate, stating: \"It's absolutely shocking that NHS Trusts are wasting huge amounts of money funding homeopathy and other treatments when there isn't robust evidence of their effectiveness.\" Getting a prominent group of fiscal conservatives who have the ear of the right-wing press to broadcast your message is a real coup, but many in the predominantly left-wing skeptical community would balk at the prospect of engaging with a group like the TPA on any level. When I raised the prospect in the past, one skeptic claimed \"you can't support the NHS and ally yourself with these elements,\" while another referred to \"selling your soul.\" I've no doubt that suggesting a collaboration with evangelical Christians would elicit a similar response from a few atheists. Even if people aren't opposed to working with 'the enemy', how can those with an atheist or left-wing viewpoint put effective arguments across to an audience they fundamentally don't relate to? The evangelicals preach the importance of responsible stewardship of God's creation, Earth. The TPA preach small government, and the importance of reining in public spending. These are powerful arguments for large sections of the public, but not something I'd attempt, and you're unlikely to find them advanced on many science blogs. I've written previously about women in science blogging, and the likes of Alom Shaha have tackled ethnic diversity in atheism; but the left-wing bias in our community is perhaps even greater still. And maybe that ought to give us pause for thought in an age where science is increasingly at the center of political controversies, from climate change to drug harm. Are science writers online too hostile to conservatives? Can we do more to reach out to right-wing or religious groups? And if we don't have a diverse range of voices, can we still reach a range of people across the political spectrum? Does it really matter? Am I a hypocrite for writing this given my history of Daily Mail bashing? Is anyone still reading?
