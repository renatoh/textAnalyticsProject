Further along, dramatic news reports from 10-year-olds tell of worldwide floods and famines, and mood poems reflect the alternative lifestyles of Traveller families. These displays of work around Fulham primary school in south-west London represent the vast diversity of children's backgrounds. Many students come from refugee or asylum-seeking families. The displays of photos encapsulate the school's approach to teaching and learning. \"If we can't work with the child's family, we are only working with half a child,\" says Azita Horwood, the headteacher, as she explains the school's approach to race equality. Under the Race Relations Act, all schools must have a race equality policy to tackle unfairness, and to help children to work and play in a racially harmonious environment. The policy should include all aspects of school life, such as opportunities for parents to take part; how to help children's progress; and fair ways to manage behaviour and wellbeing. The policy should also take account of admissions; methods of teaching and learning ; what children learn; and the racial backgrounds of staff. \"Our policy is a living, breathing document that we integrate into everything the school does,\" says Horwood. Her commitment to equality of opportunity is clear - from the recruitment of staff, who represent a range of ethnic backgrounds, to the halal meat served on the school menu. But unlike Fulham primary, other schools may be failing to fully address equality issues. According to Nick Johnson, former director of policy of the Commission for Racial Equality and now principal associate of the Institute of Community Cohesion, some schools are being awarded good or outstanding Ofsted reports when their equality policies are not up to scratch. He is co-author of a report for the CRE that recommends legal action against Ofsted for failing to monitor schools adequately. Schools not proactive \"Schools generally do not equip pupils to live in a diverse society,\" says Johnson. \"Although schools are usually OK at monitoring admissions and exclusion rates, they are failing in proactive work, like building good relations between pupils of different backgrounds.\" The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which came into force in 2001, following the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, gave public authorities, including schools, a duty to promote race equality, eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity. Schools were to adopt a more practical approach to race equality, for example linking the curriculum to equality issues, and building good relations between pupils of different backgrounds. But according to some campaigners, the message was lost in translation from local education authorities to schools, and schools were left with a task, but little understanding of why or how they should do it. The worry is that the country's changing demographics and rapidly growing diversity, in particular the impact of migrant families, mean pupils in schools that don't have a hands-on approach to equality issues may not be prepared for the change. \"Schools could be in danger of producing exam candidates rather than citizens,\" says Johnson. Now Ofsted is coming under fire over its monitoring of schools. Its inspectors should pick up on a school's equality policies - but do they? \"There is a lack of rigour in the way Ofsted inspectors look at race equality policies, or even ask to see them at all,\" says Johnson. The CRE report published in September recommends legal action against Ofsted on the grounds that it has failed to promote race equality. The 2005-07 Monitoring and Enforcement Plan report gives a final update on how well the public sector complies with requirements of the Race Relations Act. It lists priorities for action for the newly formed Equality and Human Rights Commission. As well as having the poorest record on race of any public regulatory body, Ofsted, it says, \"is arguably the most uncooperative public authority the commission has had to deal with over the last two years\". The Equality and Human Rights Commission is now \"examining Ofsted's response and will consider whether further action is necessary\", says a spokesman. Ofsted points out that in September it strengthened its guidance to inspectors. Its spokesman says: \"All the evidence is considered carefully during an inspection. Where there is clear evidence of underachievement, or disproportionate exclusions of different groups of pupils, this will contribute to the graded judgments. However, race equality issues may not always be referred to specifically in the inspection report. Where appropriate, inspectors will include good practice in the report. \"Inspectors are now asked to check that schools have a written race equality policy, assess and monitor its impact and record any racist incidents,\" says the spokesman. One of the concerns cited in the CRE report relates to poor quality race equality training. In Fulham, Horwood's own experience of an inspection was marred by one incident: \"I was asked by an inspector if I had got the job of headteacher of a multicultural school because I was half Iranian.\" She was deeply offended by the question. It is not the first time that Ofsted has been made aware that it needs to do more on equality issues. A DfES report, Getting It Right, last year specifically called on Ofsted to be more proactive in getting schools to meet their statutory obligations. The report found that it was no longer acceptable to point solely to out-of-school factors as reasons for the high number of exclusions of black children, and more needed to be done in schools. Ofsted admits more needs to be done and plans further training on race equality for its inspectors. \"All inspectors received training and guidance in January, with a strong focus on gathering evidence and forming judgments in the inspection of achievement, attainment and wellbeing of all ethnic groups,\" says the spokesman. \"We plan to provide further training. Revised guidance for inspectors \"We have made changes to improve the inspection of race equality issues in schools. However, we are not complacent and are committed to making a consistent impact in the inspection of race equality in all our inspections,\" says the spokesman. There is explicit revised guidance for inspectors on how to inspect race equality. There will shortly be an evaluation of the changes in the guidance to see what impact they have had on inspection practice. \"Ofsted is absolutely determined to fully comply with its equalities duties and become an exemplar for others to look to. We are acting on the points made by the CRE,\" says the spokesman. Ofsted has a new duty to inspect schools' work on promoting community cohesion from September 2008, he adds. Many headteachers don't need to be told by inspectors what they should be doing. At Hamstead Hall school for 11- to 18-year-olds in Birmingham, it was found that black boys were disproportionately represented in exclusion figures and had a pattern of underachievement. \"A black parents' group was set up because we knew that working with families was an essential part of the process\" says Kendrick Morris, the headteacher. \"We invited parents of all black boys to an evening meeting and hoped that parents of boys who were doing well would help those who had difficulties with their sons' behaviour or motivation,\" he says. The parent meetings, each half term, continued for 18 months, during which the boys were assigned a mentor and attended regular sessions on a range of issues. \"This partnership with parents cannot be underestimated,\" says Morris. The initiative was commended in the school's last Ofsted report, which said it \"has resulted in reduced numbers of exclusions and much improved achievement, in particular for black boys. It shows the effectiveness of action taken when school and parents work together and understand what each requires from the other.\" It's not just ethnically diverse schools that need race equality policies. Christchurch junior school in Christchurch, Dorset, has an almost all-white intake of children. \"All areas of the curriculum can be used to promote children's awareness of different races and religions,\" says Alison Smith, the headteacher. Some feel that the ethos of the school is more important than a policy. \"It's the feeling, spirit and intention of the school that matter most,\" says Morris. \"A policy is just a document that people can follow meaninglessly.\" But a document that helps to ensure consistency in schools, which is something that is sorely needed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
