We were right in the middle of it, as our departure shortly preceded the demolition of our block of flats and its replacement with, I hope, better-designed and longer-lasting housing for the people who remain. I never doubted the regeneration programme in our neighbourhood would be disruptive and expensive. The alternative was to leave it to muddle on in a state of immense disrepair, with its residents remaining economically disadvantaged, and suffering above-average rates of illness. Investment has to be committed, focused and lasting: housing specialist Anne Power has shown time and again that regenerating hard-to-live-in estates works only if physical renewal is matched by socio-economic improvement. It was with an arched eyebrow, then, that I came across Lord [Andrew] Mawson's book The Social Entrepreneur, extracts from which were published in last week's Society. Mawson has been the galvanising figure behind the Bromley-by-Bow Centre - yards from where I used to live - for more than 20 years, and has strong opinions about how to improve quality of life in Britain's poorest wards, of which Bromley-by-Bow is one. While he's rightly proud of his achievements in setting up Britain's first healthy living centre and developing social enterprises that employ 100 local people, many of his claims for its success bear little resemblance to my experience of life in the area. The centre represented many things: visual relief on the grim walk between our flats and the motorway-side supermarket; apparent proof that good things are more likely to happen in good environments; and the creation of as much resentment as goodwill. Mawson writes that \"people are growing weary of traditional methods of community consultation and community governance, which have failed to engage their interest or commitment, or make any real changes to their lives\". Yet despite his insistence that the Bromley-by-Bow model works, the living conditions of far too many within reach of the centre remain broadly unchanged. Next to the centre lie barracks-like blocks of flats in which families must raise children who are growing up in many cases to regard those blocks as \"territories\" to be defended at all costs. Those on the \"outside\" of the centre - those who know it exists but can't get their heads around how you get to be on the \"inside\" - see it as a club, with all the connotations of exclusivity and I'm-all-right-Jack-ness that the word confers. The work of the centre and its enterprises has made a huge difference to the lives of the people who become involved in it. A neighbour began attending art classes for pleasure and ended up a member of staff, running her own courses. But walk a few steps in any direction from its gates and there are thousands who are simply stuck with very little prospect of change without massive intervention, which, whether Mawson likes it or not, would have to come from the state. It will take an avalanche of involvement, commitment and money to convince people living in places like Bromley-by-Bow that their lives will change. No matter how many new enterprises \"the social entrepreneur\" gets off the ground, such an approach is piecemeal. A landscape gardening business, for instance, is not going to become a major local employer; neither is a dance studio or a hairdresser's. It's not expected in wider society that everyone should want to set up their own pottery business, so why should it be used as a model for transforming poor people's lives? The idea of social entrepreneurship, while appearing to generate a third way between the state and the market, is no better than a charity-sector version of Dragons' Den if it is presented to entire communities as \"the only way\" to do things. Such is the lot of the organisation trying to do \"good work\" in a place that seems to have been deliberately blighted by bad planning or, at best, left to survive on wits alone. But it has to admit to itself that it can only do so much: to do otherwise comes dangerously close to blaming the people who live there for their own misfortune. \u00b7 Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: An Intimate History (Granta, \u00a37.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
