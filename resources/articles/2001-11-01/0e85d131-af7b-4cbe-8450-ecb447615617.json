They are under intense pressure to come up with an outline plan for the future government of their country. An agreement would open the way for a flood of foreign aid, and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force. Failure, on the other hand, would change nothing at all: Afghanistan will continue to slide into bloody and fragmented chaos. So far, so good. The opening day of the talks went well, with the delegates reportedly in conciliatory mood. The main doubt lies in the relatively low status of the delegations. Diplomatic observers cannot be sure that, even if they reach full agreement, anyone else will listen. There are four separate delegations. The most obviously important is from the Northern Alliance, whose armies now control most of Afghanistan. The rest are exiled groups: one is based in Rome and owes allegiance to the former king, Zahir Shah; the other two are based in Cyprus and in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar. The alliance delegation is headed by Yunis Qanuni. He is seen as a rising star in the murky firmament of Afghan politics, but is no substitute for his faction leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani. Worryingly for the UN, which rather quixotically still recognises Rabbani as president of Afghanistan - he was chased out of Kabul by the Taliban in 1996 - the alliance leader is playing down the importance of the Bonn talks. He is piqued by international refusal to hold the meeting in Kabul, under the guns of Rabbani's own Jamiat-i-Islami faction. The alliance is also cool-to-frosty on the issue of an international military force to secure the peace and distribute aid. In Afghanistan, possession is very much nine-tenths of the law, and Rabbani's men don't want to surrender or share any of their territorial gains. The problem is that the alliance is a very loose and fragile coalition, parts of which could shear off at any time. As yet, it has no significant links with the all-important Pashtun community which, though it accounts for 38% of the population, has traditionally ruled the Kabul roost. The UN, with strong support from Washington, would dearly like to see Zahir Shah - a Pashtun - reinstalled in Kabul, though not necessarily on the throne, as the titular head of a broad-based interim administration. He wants that too but, at the age of 87, he has not even made it to Bonn. The phrase \"broad-based\" has become a mantra which could raise more problems than it solves. To secure the support of Afghanistan's patchwork of ethnic and religious minorities will be a Herculean task. For example, the Hazara community, mostly Shia Muslims, are not directly represented in Bonn, though they account for up to 20% of the population. The relatively junior status of the Bonn delegations could well help them reach agreement. On paper, the task before them is simple; everyone, after all, is in favour of peace, especially if it comes with a torrent of overseas aid. It should not be difficult for the 25 delegates and their assorted advisers to agree to the outline plan: an interim coalition administration, to be followed by a traditional national council, or loya jirga, to determine the future government. The UN special envoy chairing the talks, Lakhdar Brahimi, says he wants such an agreement by the end of the week. He might well get what he wants: a rational, coherent blueprint for a devastated country in which those qualities have no meaning whatever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
