If it's not Dave Lee Roth demanding a bowl of M&amp;Ms before each gig with all the brown ones taken out, or Jennifer Lopez refusing to set foot in a studio unless the floor has been scrubbed with a toothbrush, it's a pouting Steve Gerrard spouting off about who he thinks should be Liverpool chairman, where he wants the club's next ground to be built, and exactly how many slaps Harry Kewell should be given to wake him up during a game. Still, the man certainly has talent and a knack for popping up at the right time, doesn't he? And Stevie G's rollicking Big Cup goal against Olympiakos last night - just 31 minutes after he should have been sent off for a monstrous foul on Ieroklis Stoltidis - has come at a most opportune moment, what with Merseyside's second-best club announcing losses of \u00a321.9m just last month. For a place in the last 16 of Big Cup will bring in another \u00a35m to go with the \u00a312m they've already made. Ching! Ching! However the club are refusing to rest on their financial laurels. \"Celebrate Stevie G's goal with style,\" their official website giddily blurts, \"buy a bobble hat, keyring or Corinthian figure of our [Big Cup] hero!\" The man himself, however, is a little more sanguine. \"I want to be in a side which challenges for the [Big Cup] and the title all the time,\" he told the Liverpool Echo. \"We have to build on wins like this, not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further.\" With Milan, Inter, Juventus, Lyon or Bayer Leverkusen awaiting in the last 16, that could be easier said than done. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It's possible for Chelsea to win the [Big Cup] and the Premiership, why not? Mourinho has won [Big Cup] before, and my players had a good experience last year. When Arsenal beat us in the league I told Roman Abramovich that the moment would come and eventually I was right\" - yep, it's all down to you, Claudio Ranieri. ********************* GLORY DIAZ When a club is sinking faster than Andy Fordham on the Titanic, the chairman has several tried 'n' trusted options to turn it round. There's the \"team-building\" trip to La Manga, of course (where the star striker usually gets his teeth into more than just a pre-training meal). Or the overpriced signing of a fat, ageing international with an even fatter pay-packet. But Firoz Kassam - chairman of Oxford, currently 20th in League Two (or Division Four in old currency) has, like Tony Blair, chanced upon a Third Way to get himself out of trouble: signing possibly the best manager in South America. Step forward Ramon Diaz - who took River Plate to five Argentine league titles (three Apertura and two Clousura) as well as the 1996 Copa Libertadores (South America's answer to Big Cup). He was some player too, turning out for many of the best clubs in Italy (Inter, Napoli, Fiorentina) and winning 24 caps for Argentina. (Not that it's enough to sate Diego Maradona, who, in his autobiography El Diego, writes: \"Diaz ended up scoring a lot of goals, but he should admit that I taught him how to finish in 1979. Before that, it seemed like he had to make a hole in the goalie's chest to score.\") Such managerial quality doesn't come cheap, mind: Diaz will be bringing two coaches, a doctor, a physio and two translators to Oxford after signing one of those fashionable six-month contracts earlier today. Still, Oxford chairman Kassam - 443rd on the Sunday Times Rich List and estimated to be worth \u00a390m - should be able to afford it. \"He is a friend of a friend and has come in for six months to get me out of a hole,\" he cackled. Diaz, for his part, reckons that: \"England was the only country I wanted to work in.\" Mmm, wonder if he'll still be so keen come a snowy Darlington in January? ********************* STUFF YOU MIGHT LIKE Admire Big Sam as Bob Carolgees and El Hadji Diouf as Spit the Dog in the Gallery: http://football.theguardian.com/gallery/0,8555,1369315,00.html Where your money is best-placed this weekend, with James Eastham: http://football.theguardian.com/News_Story/0,1563,1370200,00.html ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Blackburn look set to plug their leaky defence with rubbish full back (but brilliant Scrabble score) Abel Xavier.

The FA, the Premier League, and the Football League have today all offered their backing to the Independent Football Commission, which is nice. Graeme Souness has abandoned his bid to explain his sending-off against Fulham. He had already pleaded guilty to the charge, but now says he is too busy to attend a personal hearing with FA chiefs. * * * * * * * * * * * MORE STUFF YOU MIGHT LIKE Our greatest internet sports games, on the same page for your infinite convenience: http://sport.theguardian.com/thegear/story/0,12490,1073461,00.html Win signed Match of the Day goodies with our fantastic 12 days of Christmas giveaway: http://sport.theguardian.com/12daysofchristmas/0,15610,1364816,00.html * * * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS! \"Just wanted to congratulate you on the pterodactyl gag about Liverpool in yesterday's Fiver.
