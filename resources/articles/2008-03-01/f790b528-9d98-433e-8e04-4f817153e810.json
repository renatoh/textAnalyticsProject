The strong language and the accusations of racism could prove embarrassing to Obama, who has based his candidacy on a message of unity. In his sermons Wright reportedly refers to America as being under the influence of the Ku Klux Klan and describes black Republicans as sell-outs. \"The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing 'God Bless America'. No, no, no, God damn America, that's in the Bible for killing innocent people,\" he said in a 2003 sermon which was reviewed by ABC television. \"God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.\" Obama has been a member of the congregation of Wright's Trinity United Church of Christ in south side of Chicago for nearly 20 years, and he drew the title of his book from one of his pastor's sermons. The pastor's sermons are available for sale at the church and both ABC and Fox News reviewed the addresses. In January, Wright spoke from the pulpit in praise of Obama's leadership and comparing him to Jesus's struggles under the Romans, according to Fox television. \"Barack knows what it means living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people,\" Wright said. \"Hillary would never know that.\" He went on: \"Hillary ain't never been called a nigger. Hillary has never had a people defined as a non-person.\" Wright also took issue with the idea that Bill Clinton had been a friend to African Americans. \"Hillary is married to Bill, and Bill has been good to us. No he ain't! Bill did us, just like he did Monica Lewinsky. He was riding dirty.\" On the Sunday immediately following 9/11, Wright described the attacks as retribution for the bombing of Hiroshima, America's policy in the Middle East and apartheid era South Africa. Obama has told reporters he was not in church on that Sunday. However, it is the inversion of the line \"God Bless America\" that may expose Obama to the greatest criticism. Last month, his wife, Michelle, was criticised by rightwing blogs and indirectly by the Republicans' presumptive nominee, John McCain, for saying she had not been proud of being an American for most of her adult life. Wright retired from the church last month. Obama has defended his pastor in the past, most notably after it emerged that a church magazine had honoured the Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan. In a meeting with Jewish leaders in Cleveland earlier this month, Obama compared Wright to an \"old uncle\" who said disagreeable things. He went on to add: \"I suspect there are some of the people in this room who have heard relatives say some things that they don't agree with, including, on occasion, directed at African Americans.\" His campaign told ABC that Obama did not think of his pastor in political terms. \"Senator Obama does not think of the pastor of his church in political terms. Like a member of his family, there are things he says with which Senator Obama deeply disagrees. But now that he is retired, that doesn't detract from Senator Obama's affection for Reverend Wright or his appreciation for the good works he has done,\" campaign spokesman, Bill Burton, told ABC in a statement. However, the latest focus on Wright comes at a potentially volatile stage of the campaign with a hiatus of several weeks before the next primary in Pennsylvania on April 22. The lull between major contests has led to a series of rows between the Clinton and Obama campaigns over race and gender. Last week, Samantha Power, a foreign policy adviser to Obama, was forced to resign after calling Clinton a \"monster\". This week, Geraldine Ferraro, who was the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate in 1984, was forced to stand down after claiming Obama would not be leading the race if he weren't black. Nor are such culture wars exclusive to the Democratic race. McCain has come under pressure to repudiate a televangelist supporter, the Reverend Rod Parsley. Parsley, who is from Ohio, has spoken of a clash of civilisations between Islam and Christianity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
