And \u201cSmell to get well (Wine, cheese, goats).\u201d And \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let it lie!\u201d. And \u201cOh no \u2013 I\u2019ve fallen\u201d. And a million more catchphrases, characters, looks, and rudimentary disguises that \u2013 I assure all those of you under 30 currently looking at me with the growing certainty that I am undergoing some kind of catastrophic neurological event \u2013 made no more sense in context than they do shorn of it. That was, you realised perhaps as Donald and Davey Stott were halfway through discussing Message in a Bottle with Sting (\u201cDid you throw it overarm or did you throw it underarm?\u201d), the point. You had to let go of everything. And they made us laugh so hard. I\u2019m laughing just as hard as I type them out now, 25 years from when they first graced our screens in Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer\u2019s first television foray, Vic &amp; Bob\u2019s Big Night Out (BBC Two). It came back. Almost the same title and the same two friends doing the same daft things they have always done \u2013 Bob fully committed, Vic with just the very faintest trace of self-consciousness \u2013 and the same general sense that the whole thing may be sponsored by the Campaign for Stopping Americans Ever Immigrating Here En Masse Or at Least Settling in Properly If They Do. Such differences as there are \u2013 a shared desk, an opening rather than closing song, some pre-recorded sketches \u2013 are drawn mostly from the duo\u2019s other shows, The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer and Bang, Bang, It\u2019s Reeves and Mortimer. But the basic vibe of Vic &amp; Bob\u2019s Big Night Out , shown on BBC Four last week) is the same as it always was, and you are as free to collapse in hysterics or to walk away utterly baffled by unintelligible nonsense as you ever were. After the song (\u201cEat your boiled potatoes! Eat your Curly Wurly!\u201d) the boys settled down for some chat \u2013 \u201cHow high\u2019s your cat?\u201d, \u201cHow many teeth have you got? Today?\u201d, \u201cHave you ever thrown up at a disciplinary hearing?\u201d. As Reeves and Mortimerian tradition dictates, if it adhered to any logic at all, it was only ever internal and for a single exchange (\u201cHow do you prep your turkeys for Christmas?\u201d \u201cWe just tell them straight out they\u2019re gonna die\u201d) before being immediately subsumed in the foamy waves of something even dafter \u2013 in this case, some dancing that I am not even going to attempt to describe. There was a frying-pan fight, too. After an ad break \u2013 in which the pair played Norfolk farmers selling \u201csecret soil\u201d in small polymer bags (\u201cHide it in your house or about yourself!\u201d \u201cOnly you know where the soil is hidden\u201d) and later, a companion product \u201cthrowing mud\u201d \u2013 we met \u201cTom Cruise the actor\u201d, a large English man who looks possibly less like Tom Cruise than any other human being in the world, who interrupted them endlessly to talk them through his latest stunt, before giving them a pound each for sweets and heading off. But the sweets had to wait, as the pair had a tin of corned beef to get through first, backed by a sultry soundtrack. After a brief diversion into Hollywood esoterica courtesy of the wildly wigged Keep on Truckin\u2019 Sandwich Club (\u201cDo you know Eric Clapton? Well he climbed up the chimney in the orphanage near me to make a dramatic entrance for the the kids at Christmas. But he got there too soon, it was June\u201d and \u201cGeorge Clooney was born with a cockatoo crest \u2013 I cut it off with a pair of scissors I got in the Navy\u201d) and the things they have sold to Chris Evans on eBay (he snapped up a bag of zips for \u00a329,000, and a bag of Saxon nick nacks for \u00a358,000) it was off to \u2026 Novelty Island! And who should turn up to perform the first act but Graham Lister, \u201cBritain\u2019s only gay man\u201d! It was good to see him again. He remains disgusted by Reeves\u2019 dandyism \u2013 \u201cparading around like a chaffinch with his tackle out\u201d \u2013 and brings us Beaky the Owl, who urinates into a milk bottle on the command \u201cShakira!\u201d. He is followed by George Meat Market \u2013 \u201cHere to raise awareness of a condition he thinks he might have\u201d, and Bill Decker, a murderer, previously seen performing as George Michael on the duo\u2019s version of Stars in Their Eyes. I was hit by a pervading sense that this might be the closest I am ever going to come to feeling young again. There is only one way to enjoy Vic and Bob and that is in the moment, like a child. You can try to analyse what they do, of course \u2013 and you can play quite a good game of adjectival bingo with their reviews; surreal, absurd, Dadaist, Milliganesque, vaudevillian for a full house, a mention of Eric Morecambe for extra credit \u2013 but more than with any other comedian or comic duo or group I can think of, that is to kill the butterfly in order to pin it to the card and label its dead parts. Better just to marvel as it takes flight, born on the warm currents of guff emanating from two friends who still just make each other laugh and are glad to have others along for the ride. Pass the fat, Davey, and roll on next week\u2019s ball of daft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
