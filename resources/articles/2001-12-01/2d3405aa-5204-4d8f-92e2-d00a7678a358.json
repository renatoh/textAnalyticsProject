Prudence suggests that any hype should be restrained, yet given the midfielder's recent revelatory progress next summer's World Cup must be in range. In West Ham's past three matches Cole has mastered Manchester United, bamboozled Arsenal and survived a severe test of his patience at Leicester. All this from the centre of midfield where many feared he would be too fragile to cope. After being felled for the penalty which gained West Ham a point on Saturday, Cole endured a 20-minute examination of his temperament which suggested a toughness to complement his talent. Leicester's players incorrectly felt Cole had dived after Matt Elliott's tackle from behind and sought retribution. Cole defended himself afterwards. \"I have never dived and never will do,\" he said. \"I felt it was a definite penalty and if anyone wants to come and look at my calf and see how badly bruised it is then they are welcome.\" Leicester made their own minds up. Elliott kicked and slapped Cole as he lay on the ground and was sent off after headbutting Trevor Sinclair who had come to his team-mate's aid. Robbie Savage was subsequently booked for a brutal tackle on Cole, and Cole then had the pleasure of Dennis Wise's company for the final 10 minutes. Within a minute Wise was spoken to by the referee for his close attention to Cole's shins. Yet Cole, far from shying away, tried even more impudent skills and was booked for a late tackle on Muzzy Izzet. \"He's a tough boy,\" said West Ham's manager Glenn Roeder. \"People have been talking about his talent for years, but they were just seeing his silky ball skills. He's also a good tackler, good in the air and able to defend. He has been working on his upper-body strength and does a weights programme three times a week. \"This match was all part of the learning curve for Joe and it was a backhanded compliment to him that someone of Dennis's experience has left him a few calling cards before even kicking the ball.\" The melee that followed the penalty decision did nothing for the images of either club, whose Christmas bash excesses have been well documented. Hayden Foxe remained on the bench on Saturday but confirmed afterwards that he had been West Ham's guilty party. \"I wouldn't go as far as saying I was pissing at the bar in front of a thousand people,\" he said. \"It was a discreet little quiet one.\" A more tasteful moment was Paolo di Canio's delicately chipped penalty which equalised Izzet's first-half strike from the edge of the area. Roeder described reports linking the Italian with Manchester United as \"very unsettling for the player and the club because anyone who gets linked with them will be flattered\". Cole will be pleased with his manager's glowing assessment - the question is, does Sven-Goran Eriksson agree? Man of the match : Joe Cole (West Ham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
