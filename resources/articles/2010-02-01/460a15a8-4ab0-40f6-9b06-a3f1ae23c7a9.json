The prime minister told the Evening Standard how his wife had helped him deal with the tragedy. He said that Jennifer's death, aged just 10 days in 2002, had changed his life and he still constantly thinks about what his daughter \u2013 who would now have been eight \u2013 would be doing if she had survived. His experience changed the way he deals with bereaved people, including the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
