He believes that holding on to first place in their Euro 2008 qualifying group would eclipse even the success of the teams that reached two consecutive World Cup finals in the 1980s. The former Norwich City manager has accepted a contract up to the end of the current qualifying campaign in succession to Lawrie Sanchez, who left to take full-time charge of Fulham in April. But he has refused to rule out the possibility of a job-share deal if the opportunity arises. \"I would love to do club management and the IFA know that. But I am fully committed to Northern Ireland for the next six games no matter what happens,\" he said. \"If all goes well then we can look at it further and if it doesn't we can go our separate ways. But I am young enough and I have got the energy and the drive to want to do club management.\" Worthington won 66 caps for his country and played a part in their 1986 World Cup campaign but he insisted qualification with his current squad would beat that achievement. \"I don't mean this disrespectfully but in those days we had top-division players and at the moment we have got a handful of Premiership players and a lot of Championship players,\" he said. \"But they have got big hearts and with that never-say-die attitude anything is possible. There seems to be a desire back in the green shirt and to me that was a key reason for taking the job.\" He left Leicester City at the end of the season after succeeding in his short-term task of helping the Foxes avoid relegation from the Championship. Previously he had led Norwich into the Premiership in 2004 but was sacked in 2006 when they were struggling back in the Championship. As a player he began his career with Ballymena United in the late 1970s. Soon he was named Northern Ireland young player of the year and in 1981 he joined Notts County, but it was with Sheffield Wednesday that he established his reputation as a reliable left-back, making 338 appearances and scoring 12 goals for the Owls between 1984 and 1994. His played well into his thirties, spending two seasons at Leeds United and a year with Stoke City, for whom he scored a spectacular own-goal against Huddersfield Town. That prompted his own goalkeeper, Carl Muggleton, to shout: \"You're finished, grandad! Why don't you just retire?\" in the dressing room afterwards. As a keen student of the game, the Irishman's decision to go into management came as little surprise and he was named player-manager of Blackpool in 1997. After 2\u00bd years at Bloomfield Road he resigned because of a dip in form. A brief stint assisting Howard Wilkinson with England Under-21 ended when he moved to Norwich to team up with his former Northern Ireland manager Bryan Hamilton for the start of the 1999-2000 season, and he has now followed in the footsteps of his former mentor. Southampton's first-team coach Glynn Snodin, like Worthington a former Sheffield Wednesday player, has been named as his assistant along with Bolton Wanderers' goalkeeping coach, Fred Barber. Worthington said he would approach his task with a relatively clean slate, and West Ham's defender George McCartney is poised for an international return. But there will be no recall for Jeff Whitley, who has not played for his country since refusing to apologise for breaking a curfew in 2005. Worthington refused to elaborate on his reasons for overlooking the midfielder, released by Cardiff City at the end of the season, but he will speak to McCartney, adding: \"I don't think we are in the position to close the door on too many Premiership players.\" Worthington has time to get acquainted with his squad before his first match in charge against Liechtenstein in August, but his first task is to keep an eye on this weekend's other qualifying games in Group F. Snodin will watch Sweden's match against Denmark in the knowledge that, if results do not go their way, Worthington's men may slip to third place on Wednesday night. \"I will try and carry on the good qualities Lawrie has put in place. I am high on discipline and I want the players to come and play with passion in a green shirt,\" Worthington said. \"I am very proud to be taking this role because when your country comes calling in such circumstances you look forward to the task. There was not much selling to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
