Over the past 11 months there have been plenty of examples of plucky rural businesses rising to the challenge of plummeting visitor numbers with innovative promotions. Take, for example, the Big Sheep in north Devon which changed its name to the Big Chicken for a month over Easter and carried out sheepdog trials using chickens, or the Highland hotelier offering Bed and Teeth packages - the former dentist converted a room at the Craigerne Hotel into a surgery and offered to fit guests with a shiny new set of dentures during their stay. 'Foot and mouth forced a lot of businesses to rethink their strategy instead of just doing the same old thing,' said Malcolm Bell, chief executive of South West Tourism, which miraculously ended 2001 with visitor numbers up on the previous year. This is great news for the public, but as visitors flood back, Bell concedes there's a danger that complacency will creep back too. While many excellent hotels, B&amp;Bs and attractions will have weathered the storm by being good at what they do, there are still far too many mediocre outfits who are able to keep hanging on in there simply because they happen to be in a tourism hotspot where customer demand exceeds supply. Next week the English Tourism Council will launch a campaign to get people back into the countryside. Before they do, I have a small request. To the surly barmaid in a Shropshire pub who snapped 'You've missed lunch,' as we walked through the door at 1.15pm on a Sunday and then charged \u00a37 for a lump of dry bread and cheese; to the Cornish taxi driver who at the last minute cancelled a New Year's Eve booking, made two months earlier, because he'd had a better offer; to the car-hire company in Plymouth who wouldn't consider renting out a car for anything less than a week; and to the sour-faced owner of a posh London B&amp;B who thinks it's acceptable to treat her guests like naughty schoolchildren: the foot and mouth crisis may be over but if the going gets tough again, please don't ask where all the tourists have gone. I, for one, will be on the first plane to Spain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
