The Double-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians said the special promotion tied to the 27 April game against the Altoona Curve will include on-field lie-detector tests and a series of storytelling activities. The first 100 fans will receive a pair of suspenders upon entering Canal Park, while any fan in attendance named Brian Williams will have an opportunity to throw out a ceremonial first pitch, the team said in a release. Other elements of the promotion will include the ceremonial burning of a pair of pants, purportedly from Williams himself. Attendees will also have the opportunity to audition to be Williams\u2019 successor behind the NBC Nightly News desk. The fan-voted winner\u2019s video will be forwarded to the network, the team said. Williams, star anchor and managing editor for NBC News, was suspended for six months without pay Tuesday over his false story of coming under fire in a US military helicopter in Iraq. \u201cWe thought this would be a fun, tongue-in-cheek night for our fans,\u201d RubberDucks general manager Jim Pfander, adding that 27 April is National Tell a Story Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
