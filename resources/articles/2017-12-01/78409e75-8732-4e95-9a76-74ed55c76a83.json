M\u00fcnch had never won a match at the world championships \u2013 progressing only in 2012 when Denis Ovens retired \u2013 while Lewis had never lost in the first round, but the German found a remarkable run of form to prevail by three sets to one. Lewis looked in control after winning the first set and going 2-0 up in the second, but M\u00fcnch, who beat Russia\u2019s Aleksandr Oreshkin in the preliminary round, broke back at 2-1 down and closed out the second set after racing ahead in the final leg. M\u00fcnch opened the third set with six perfect darts, and took out double top to break Lewis again. The qualifier then hit two consecutive three-figure checkouts \u2013 158 and 118 \u2013 to take the set. The 29-year-old continued his hot streak in the fourth, checking out from 124 and closing out the final leg on his own throw to seal the biggest upset so far at this year\u2019s tournament. Lewis, who won the tournament in 2011 and 2012, faces the prospect of dropping out of the world\u2019s top 16 and joins Dave Chisnall, James Wade and Jelle Klaasen in making an early exit. M\u00fcnch\u2019s victory comes the day after 63-year-old qualifier Paul Lim eliminated Mark Webster. \u201cIt feels so amazing, I\u2019m over the moon,\u201d M\u00fcnch told the PDC\u2019s official channel. \u201cI was so confident at the key moments, I played my game and not Adrian\u2019s. Time to relax, practice and get ready for the second round.\u201d Things were much more straightforward for another former champion, Raymond van Barneveld, who comfortably defeated the debutant Richard North. The Dutchman had not dropped a set in the first round since the 2012 tournament, and maintained that streak with a 3-0 win. North could not compete with Van Barneveld\u2019s 102 average and could not take opportunities when they came along, hitting three of 13 shots at a double. \u201cRichard is a great player, I really thought he could be dangerous,\u201d Van Barneveld said afterwards. \u201cThis tournament is special to me, so maybe I keep my form and energy for these two weeks.\u201d Scotland\u2019s John Henderson eased past Finland\u2019s Marko Kantele by a 3-0 scoreline in Tuesday\u2019s other game. Michael Smith and Simon Whitlock are in first-round action on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
