Three scholars called by Democratic members of the committee said that the president\u2019s handling of Ukraine military aid and the leveraging of his office for personal gain are impeachable offenses. A law professor that the Republicans called to testify said that the evidence is too thin, and the reasons for impeaching the president too narrow to justify a case against the president now. One of the experts, Pamela Karlan, apologized after the First Lady criticized her for punning off Barron Trump\u2019s name to make the point that the president is not a king. Donald Trump cut short his attendance at the Nato summit after a video captured world leaders apparently ridiculing him. The Trump administration approved a new rule that will cut nearly 70,000 people from the federal food stamp program. William Barr\u2019s hand-picked prosecutor wasn\u2019t able to provide evidence that to support right-wing suspicions that the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was a setup, the Washington Post reports: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said. The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz\u2019s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the inspector general\u2019s findings have not been made public. But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets, the people said. And Durham informed Horowitz\u2019s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general\u2019s findings on that point. NBC appears to have confirmed the Post\u2019s reporting. The Justice Department IG has an upcoming report investigating the origins of Russia investigation, separate from the one being conducted by Barr\u2019s prosecutor. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to soon announce future hearings, including testimony from the attornies for the Republicans and Democrats on the Hosue Intelligence committee, who will present the reports and findings from the investigation so far. After that, the Judiciary Committee will likely draw up articles of impeachment, vote on them. The exact timing of when all of this will happen is still unclear. It\u2019s also unclear which articles the committee will draft. The House Intelligence report released yesterday makes a case for obstruction of justice and abuse of power. Chairman Nadler gaveled the hearing closed, after delivering his closing remarks. Trump put his own interests above the national interest, Nadler said. Trump asked a\u201cforeign government to intervene in our elections, then got caught, then obstructed the investigators twice.\u201d \u201cThe constitution has a solution for a president who places his personal or political interests above those in the nation, the power of impeachment,\u201d Nadler concluded. When Republican member Louie Gohmert tried to get Nadler\u2019s attention (with a unanimous consent request), Nadler responded \u201cToo late\u201d and banged his gavel. \u201cTypical,\u201d Gohmert could be heard mumbling. A very animated Doug Collins said, \u201cThis is not a time to play hide the ball\u201d and repeatedly called for Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff testify before the Judiciary Committee. He said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to hold these hearings and that lawmakers had not talked to enough \u201cfact witnesses\u201d. The Democrats, he said, are \u201cso obsessed with the election next year, they just gloss over things.\u201d Collins also repeated a Republican talking point that Ukraine only became aware that aid was being withheld \u201cone month after\u201d the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call. However, Pentagon official Laura Cooper testified that Ukraine was aware of the aid in early July, before the call. Representative Jerry Nadler, the leading Democrat on the committee, and Doug Collins, the leading Republican are now giving closing statements. Read the key takeaways from today\u2019s testimonies: Pamela Karlan made a distinction between Trump\u2019s political positions on foreign affairs and his right to solicit electoral interference from foreign powers. \u201cYes there is political influence in our foreign affairs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exited climate accords, we\u2019ve taken different positions on Nato than we would have taken if his opponent won.\u201d That\u2019s different from partisan politics in the context of electoral manipulation, she said. \u201cIf we get over that or get used to that, we will cease to become the democracy that we are now\u201d Witness Pamela Karlan apologized for making a put out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that...I do regret having said that,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s happy to apologize though the president hasn\u2019t apologized for offensive comments he\u2019s made in the past. Earlier, Michael Johnson, a Republican representative from Louisiana, read a tweet by First Lady Melania Trump criticizing Karlan\u2019s comment into the public record of the hearing. In other non-impeachment political news, the Trump administration approved a rule that will remove nearly 700,000 people from the federal food-stamp program by tightening work requirements for recipients. From the AP: The move by the administration is the latest in its attempt to scale back the social safety net for low-income Americans. It is the first of three proposed rules targeting the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP, to be finalized. The program feeds more than 36 million people. The plan, announced Wednesday, will limit states from exempting work-eligible adults from having to maintain steady employment in order to receive benefits. The Agriculture Department estimates the change would save roughly $5.5 billion over five years and cut benefits for roughly 688,000 SNAP recipients... The final rule will be published in the federal register Thursday, and go into effect in April. Meanwhile, elsewhere on Capitol Hill... Those still holed up in the Judiciary Committee hearing can reportedly hear echoes of holiday cheer filtering in from the outside world. Several Republicans committee members have read from the memo that Donald Trump released summarizing his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. \u201cThey never mentioned the 2020 election. They never mentioned military aid,\u201d Kelly Armstrong, a Republican representative from North Dakota, said just now. Though the rough transcript of the call that Trump released may not contain the phrase \u201c2020 election\u201d, the president does clearly ask Ukraine to conduct investigations, including into Biden, one of his leading rivals in the upcoming elections. The transcript also shows that Trump transitions directly from talk of military aid that the Ukrainian president says his country needs to talk of a \u201cfavor\u201d that Trump needs. Pushing back against arguments made by Jonathan Turley, who said that Democrats didn\u2019t have enough evidence to make a case for impeachment at this point, Michael Gerhardt said that lawmakers have tried to gather more evidence. \u201cI might just point out that one of the difficulties with asking for a more thorough investigation is that\u2019s exactly what the House has tried to conduct here,\u201d he said, \u201cThe president has refused to comply with subpoenas and other requests for documents.\u201d Val Demmings, the Democratic representative from Florida who questioned Gerhardt, agreed that Trump was \u201cdesperate\u201d to prevent investigations into his actions. \u201cThe president\u2019s obstruction of Congress is pervasive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are facing a categorically blockade by a president who is desperate to prevent any investigation into his wrongdoing.\u201d \u201cHas a president ever refused to cooperate in an impeachment investigation?\u201d Demmings asked. \u201cNot until now.\u201d Gerhardt responded. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative from Washington, is now questioning Pamela Karlan. Jayapal asked Karlan what Trump\u2019s behavior reveals about the credibility of his claim that he was most concerned about corruption. What, for example, does it mean that Trump allegedly insisted that the Ukrainian president publicly announce an investigation? \u201cGenerally you don\u2019t announce the investigation in a criminal case before you conduct it, because it puts the person under notice that they\u2019re under investigation,\u201d Karlan said. As for credibility, Karlan said, \u201cI think you ought to make that credibility determination because you have the sole power of impeachment. if I were a member of the House of Representatives I would infer that he was doing it for political reasons.\u201d The House judiciary committee is still holding its first public impeachment hearing, but I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Three legal experts called by Democratic members of the House judiciary committee testified that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine constituted impeachable offenses, a position that was contradicted by the only witness called by Republican members of the panel. The first lady, the White House and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign denounced one of today\u2019s legal experts, Pamela Karlan, after the Stanford law professor made a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d Karlan said. Democratic congressman Denny Heck, a member of the House intelligence committee, announced he would not seek reelection \u2013 citing his desire to spend more time with family and his chagrin over the Republican response to the impeachment inquiry. Rudy Giuliani reportedly traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden, even though the president\u2019s personal lawyer is under a microscope because of the impeachment inquiry. Trump canceled his final press conference at the Nato summit in London after a video surfaced of world leaders mocking the president\u2019s lengthy comments to reporters yesterday. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The first lady has now added her voice to the Republican chorus criticizing Pamela Karlan, accusing the Stanford law professor of invading the privacy of her son by making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. Karlan said earlier at today\u2019s hearing, \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d making a point about the constitution not allowing the president to distribute titles of nobility. Republicans are now arguing that the mere mention of Barron\u2019s name equates to a political attack meant to drag the first son into the impeachment inquiry. Republican congressman Tom McClintock began his five minutes of questions by asking the legal experts testifying today if they had voted for Trump in the 2016 election. This question sparked immediate pushback from Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, who argued the witnesses should not have to disclose how they cast their ballots. Chairman Jerry Nadler interjected to say that McClintock was free to ask the question but witnesses were not obligated to answer. None of the witnesses raised their hands to say they voted for Trump, but Harvard law professor Noah Feldman emphasized the lack of response should not be taken as a sign that they oppose the president. The House judiciary committee has reconvened its first public impeachment hearing, and members of the panel have resumed their five-minute rounds of questioning of today\u2019s witnesses. Republican congressman Andy Biggs kicked off questioning after the brief recess, and Democratic congressman Ted Lieu is now speaking. After Lieu, there should be 18 members of the panel left, so the hearing could conclude around 6pm ET, but it may stretch even longer. The House judiciary committee has once again recessed its impeachment hearing for five minutes, with more than a dozen members of the panel still needing to question today\u2019s witnesses. Just before chairman Jerry Nadler briefly adjourned the hearing, Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell accused George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley of acting as the Republicans\u2019 defense attorney in support of the president. \u201cThat\u2019s not my intention, sir,\u201d Turley replied. The president\u2019s reelection campaign has now called on Democrats to repudiate Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan for making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name to make a point about the Constitution not allowing presidents to distrubute titles of nobility. \u201cEvery Democrat in Congress should immediately repudiate Pamela Karlan and call on her to personally apologize to the President and the First Lady for mocking their son on national TV,\u201d said Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary. Karlan initially said at today\u2019s hearing, \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d prompting some laughter in the hearing room. Republican congressman Matt Gaetz used his five minutes of questioning to criticize the three legal experts called by Democrats on the House judiciary committee for previously donating to Democratic candidates. Gaetz especially went after Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, asking why she donated $2,000 to Hillary Clinton. Karlan responded that she had been donating a lot of money at the time because of all the \u201cpoor\u201d people in the United States. Gaetz also accused Karlan of being \u201cmean\u201d for making a pun out of the name of the president\u2019s son, Barron Trump. As Karlan was trying to respond to Gaetz\u2019s questions, the congressman told the only woman on the panel, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to interrupt me on this time.\u201d After two weeks of high-stakes hearings that included \u201cstar witnesses,\u201d an attache with the cadence and authority of Walter Cronkite, a decorated do-gooder in uniform, a British-born Russia expert who inspired fan clubs around the world and a bombshell-lobbing hotelier-turned ambassador, the distinguished panel of academics was perhaps not the made-for-TV cast these impeachment hearings had thrived on. The witnesses painted in vivid detail the actions of a president hellbent on pressuring a foreign government to harm his political rival. By contrast the professors\u2019 testimony was conceptual and high-minded. They legitimized their assertions with quotations from the Founding Fathers, references to historical treaties and pleasantries that might require an advanced degree to follow. Words like \u201cperfidy\u201d and \u201cnecromancy\u201d obscured their more relatable references to a pet goldendoodle and Thanksgiving dinner. But aside from snarky tweets, the dulcet testimony is also providing Democrats a clear rationale for removing Trump from office that they can clip and reference in the weeks to come. \u201cIf we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy,\u201d said Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe live in a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham lashed out against Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan for making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name during today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Grisham accused Karlan of disrepecting the first son\u2019s privacy by making his name a punchline. \u201cWhat is being done to this country is no laughing matter,\u201d Grisham said. It\u2019s important to note Karlan was not at all mocking Barron Trump himself. She used his name to make a light-hearted joke about how presidents cannot distribute titles of nobility. \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d Karlan said, prompting some laughter in the hearing room. Meanwhile, as the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing continues, a Republican congressman is pressing Senate judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham to subpoena the phone records of Adam Schiff and Joe Biden, among others. The request comes after the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry, which included call records from Rudy Giuliani and one of his former associates, Lev Parnas. The records showed Giuliani in contact with Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, and an official at the office of management and budget as the president\u2019s personal lawyer started peddling baseless corruption allegations againt Biden. Republican congressman Jim Jordan, who also participated in the House intelligence committee hearings, complained that Democrats were overseeing a \u201cpre-determined impeachment.\u201d Like the previous two Republican members, Jordan did not pose a single question to today\u2019s witnesses during his five-minute round of questioning, instead choosing to simply criticize the inquiry writ large. Republican congressman Louie Gohmert used his five minutes of questioning to criticize the process of the impeachment inquiry and demand that other witnesses linked to Joe Biden be made to testify, which has 0% chance of approval by the panel\u2019s Democratic majority. Republican congressman Steve Chabot just completed his five-minute round of questioning -- which he used to deliver a diatribe against chairman Jerry Nadler without posing a single question to today\u2019s witnesses. Chabot accused Nadler of reversing himself from his comments about impeachment during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency and argued the inquiry was preventing the panel from addressing other matters. Those talking points echo comments from Trump, who has accused the \u201cdo nothing Democrats\u201d of neglecting their constituents\u2019 needs. Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan has just delivered another line that is sure to be replayed many times after today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Responding to questions from Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Karlan was arguing that the Constitution makes a point to distinguish between the powers of the president and the powers of a monarch. Karlan specifically cited the president\u2019s inability to distribute titles of nobility. \u201cSo while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron,\u201d Karlan joked. The first Republican questioner after the recess was Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who was an impeachment manager during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Sensenbrenner used the first four minutes of his questioning to criticize the impeachment inquiry before posing a single question to Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by Republican members of the panel. Then his time was up. Chairman Jerry Nadler has once again gaveled in the first public impeachment hearing conducted by his panel, the House judiciary committee. The panel will continue with five-minute rounds of questions from the members of the committee, which could take another three hours or so. For reference, this hearing began almost five hours ago. Democrats on the House judiciary committee have been told to stay in Washington this weekend so the panel can complete work related to the impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s unclear what work chairman Jerry Nadler hopes for the members to complete, but it could include mock hearings regarding the Huse intelligence committee\u2019s newly released report on the impeachment inquiry. The Senate has released its calendar for 2020, but the chamber has left the month of January blank in case the House passes articles of impeachment and a trial needs to be held on whether to remove Trump from office. If the House passes articles of impeachment later this month, as it is widely expected to do, the Senate would likely take up the charges in January. Unless two-thirds of senators rule against the president, which is highly improbable, Trump will be acquitted and remain in office. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, accused Republicans on the House judiciary committee of misrepresenting his words by only quoting a portion of his comments about Hunter Biden in his book \u201cImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump.\u201d In the book, Katyal makes a point to emphasize that while Biden\u2019s conduct was not right, it also wasn\u2019t illegal -- as the business dealings of Trump\u2019s family while he is in office are not illegal. The House judiciary committee is not likely to reconvene for another 30 minutes, which could mean the impeachment hearing will not conclude for another four hours or so. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren opened her questioning of today\u2019s witnesses by noting that she has been present for all three modern impeachments -- as a staffer during Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment and as a lawmaker during Bill Clinton\u2019s. After Lofgren had concluded her questioning, chairman Jerry Nadler recessed the hearing for members to go vote on the House floor. Dozens of committee members still need to have the chance to question the witnesses, so we will be here for a while. The House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing has moved on to five-minute rounds of questioning from each member, which could run more than three hours long if everyone uses up their full time. Representative Denny Heck, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, has announced he will retire from Congress after serving four terms in the chamber. Heck cited his decades of public service, considering his years in the Washington state legislature, and his discouragement with the Russia investigation as reasons for his departure. \u201cIt is incredible work but it takes its toll. Being away so much from Paula, my best friend and wife of nearly 44 years, can be lonely even when I am in a crowded room,\u201d Heck said. \u201cAt our age, however many \u2018good years\u2019 we have left together is not a growing number. \u201cIn the spirit of complete openness, part of me is also discouraged. The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary. I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the President\u2019s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.\u201d The Republican counsel has concluded his questioning of the legal experts today, but he spent his time only posing questions to lone GOP witness Jonathan Turley -- pursuing a similar strategy as the Democratic counsel. Chairman Jerry Nadler noted this would have been the time when the White House had an opportunity to question the qitnesses, but the president declined the invitation. The panel has now moved on to five minutes of questioning from each member, beginning with Nadler. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by Republicans, criticized Democrats for not winning over more members of the opposite party about impeachment. \u201cIf you rush this impeachment, you\u2019re going to leave half the country behind,\u201d Turley warned. \u201cThis is not an impulse buy item.\u201d Paul Taylor, a longtime Republican staffer on the House judiciary committee, is now posing questions to the legal experts testifying today. (Well, so far he has only posed questions to the one witness Republicans called -- deploying the same strategy that Democrats pursued.) White House counsel Pat Cipollone is on Capitol Hill today, although he is not participating in the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing. The president was given the option to have a lawyer represent him at today\u2019s hearing, but the White House declined to do so. A Capitol Hill reporter said Cipollone was meeting with senators \u201cas part of an ongoing effort to keep Senate Republicans informed about White House thinking.\u201d A New York Times reporter noted that Jonathan Turley\u2019s argument about the impeachment inquiry moving at a record pace is actually up for debate. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who was called to testify by the Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argued members of Congress were abusing their power by moving quickly on the impeachment inquiry. \u201cFast is not good for impeachment. Fast and narrow impeachments have failed,\u201d Turley said, citing the example of former President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868 before being narrowly acquitted by the Senate. \u201cIf you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it\u2019s an abuse of power,\u201d Turley told the lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s your abuse of power.\u201d George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness at today\u2019s impeachment hearing who was called by Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argued Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine do not represent a \u201cclear case of bribery.\u201d Those comments clash with testimony from Stanford professor Pamela Karlan, who told the panel that Trump would be guilty of bribery if investigators concluded the president requested an investigation into Joe Biden to advance his political interests. Congressman Doug Collins also opened his questioning by joking that George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called to testify by the Republican minority of the House judiciary committee, was \u201cwell rested\u201d after only being asked one question by the Democratic counsel. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, opened his questioning by noting the freezing conditions of today\u2019s hearing room. Chairman Jerry Nadler has gaveled back in the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, and the Republican ranking member and Republican counsel will now be allowed to pose questions to the four legal experts testifying today. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House judiciary committee is in the midst of holding its first public impeachment hearing, where three legal experts have testified that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine constitute impeachable behavior. (A fourth expert has testified the president\u2019s behavior does not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment.) House Democrats held a closed-door meeting this morning, where members signaled their willingness to move forward with the impeachment inquiry despite the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate. Trump left the Nato summit in London without holding his scheduled final press conference after a video surfaced of world leaders seeming to mock the US president for his lengthy comments to reporters. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House Democrats held a closed-door meeting this morning to discuss the intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry, which was released yesterday, and next steps in the investigation. The Washington Post reports: According to multiple Democratic lawmakers who attended a closed-door Capitol meeting, [speaker Nancy] Pelosi announced no firm decision or timeline in moving toward Trump\u2019s impeachment. But, a day after [Adam] Schiff delivered a 300-page report detailing charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against Trump, she made clear what lay ahead in the House. \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked her colleagues, after describing the grave constitutional circumstances posed by Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing surrounding his dealings with Ukraine and his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into it. The caucus, according to multiple members, erupted with shouts of approval. \u2018We\u2019re moving forward,\u2019 said one member, summarizing the thrust of Pelosi\u2019s remarks and speaking on condition of anonymity to candidly describe a private meeting. \u2018We\u2019ve got a job to do whether people want to testify or not.\u2019 Pelosi then turned the room over to Schiff (D-Calif.), who received a standing ovation before saying a word, the members said. From the department of \u201cyou really can\u2019t make this up\u201d: the New York Times is reporting that Rudy Giuliani traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors who have pushed baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. The Times reports: Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, according to people familiar with the effort. The former prosecutors, who have faced allegations of corruption, all played some role in promoting claims about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former United States ambassador to Ukraine and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in 2016. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler has just called for a 10-minute recess in the panel\u2019s impeachment hearing, which will almost certainly become more like a 20-minute break. When the committee regroups, the Republican ranking member and Republican counsel will be given the chance to pose questions to the four legal experts testifying today. During the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, the panel\u2019s Democrats displayed a sign appearing to indicate they are considering three articles of impeachment against Trump: abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen asked the legal experts testifying at today\u2019s impeachment hearing whether the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden was an impeachable act, even though the countryultimately did not launch the probe. \u201cThe attempt itself is the impeachable act,\u201d said Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who noted that Richard Nixon\u2019s efforts to cover up the Watergate break-in were ultimately unsuccessful. But the attempts themselves clearly constituted impeachable behavior, Feldman said. Pamela Karlan and Michael Gerhardt echoed that opinion with hypothetical situations emphasizing the soliciation itself is the issue. University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt warned that lawmakers could set a dangerous precedent if they didn\u2019t impeach Trump for his actions toward Ukraine. \u201cIf what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,\u201d Gerhardt said. Stanford professor Pamela Karlan emphasized she had spent her Thanksgiving break reading the transcripts from the impeachment hearings, implicitly criticizing Republican congressman Doug Collins for implying today\u2019s witnesses had not had time to consider all the evidence. Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan said Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine meet the constitutional definition of bribery, adding credibility to Democrats\u2019 usage of the term to describe the allegations against the president. Karlan said that, if lawmakers conclude Trump requested an investigation into Joe Biden and his son for political gain, \u201cthen yes, you have bribery here,\u201d the law professor said. Harvard law professor Noah Feldman warned that the US would turn into a monarchy if its presidents cannot be impeached for using the office for personal or political gain. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen pressed Jonathan Turley, the only legal expert called to testify by Republican members of the House judiciary committee, about his Wall Street Journal op-ed on the impeachment inquiry. Eisen noted that Turley, who has argued that Trump\u2019s actions in the Ukraine controversy do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment, wrote in the op-ed, \u201cThere is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal, and it is true that impeachment doesn\u2019t require a crime.\u201d Turley confirmed he had written that but he attempted to elaborate on the argument before being cut off by Eisen, who said he was only seeking a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer on whether Turley had in fact written that. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen has now been recognized for 45 minutes of questioning, and he has started by focusing on Trump\u2019s alleged abuses of power and whether those actions constitute impeachable offenses. All three of the witnesses called by Democrats -- Noah Feldman from Harvard, Pamela Karlan from Stanford and Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina -- agreed those actions met the constitutional standard for impeachable offenses. Chairman Jerry Nadler asked University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt what concerns should be raised by Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhen the president does that, the separation of powers means nothing.\u201d Gerhardt said. The hearing has now moved on to questioning by the members of the House judiciary committee, beginning with chairman Jerry Nadler. The California Democrat began by asking Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan about the danger of a president inviting election interference from a foreign power. Karlan warned that such a request \u201ctakes the right away from the American people\u201d to determine the winners of elections. The four legal experts testifying at today\u2019s public imeachment hearing have concluded their opening statements, and the Republicans on the House judiciary committee have now forced another prcedural vote on subpoenaing the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off the inquiry. A Democratic member of the panel unsurprisingly responded with a proposal to table (or kill) the motion, which was adopted along party lines. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by the Republican members of the House judiciary committee, began his opening statement by noting he is not a supporter of the president and did not vote for Trump in 2016. However, the professor expressed fear about this inquiry setting a dangerous precedent for impeachment. \u201cI am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger,\u201d Turley said. Turley also offered a joke about the current divsion in the country. \u201cI get it, you\u2019re mad. The president\u2019s mad ... My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad,\u201d Turley said. And he noted his dog, a goldendoodle named Luna, is never mad. But he added, \u201cWill a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt similarly argued in his opening statement that Trump has participated in several acts that constitute impeachable behavior. \u201cThe record compiled thus far shows that the president has committed several impeachable offenses, including bribery, abuse of power in soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader to benefit his political campaign, obstructing Congress, and obstructing justice,\u201d Gerhardt said. The law professor closed by warning, \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil.\u201d Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan closed her opening statement by arguing the presidnet should not be inviting election interference but rather warning any country who threatens to do it. \u201cA president who cared about the Constitution would say \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening, butt out of our elections,\u2019\u201d Karlan said, referring to Trump\u2019s famous line requesting that the Kremlin try to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016. In her opening statement, Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan echoed Noah Feldman\u2019s argument that Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine represented a clear abuse of power. \u201cWhen President Trump invited \u2014 indeed, demanded \u2014 foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this a republic,\u201d Karlan said. \u201cThat demand ... constituted an abuse of power.\u201d Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan took a shot at Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, in her opening statement after the congressman implied the legal experts testifying today may not have reviewed all the evidence gathered in the impeachement inquiry. Karlan said she was \u201cinsulted\u201d by Collins\u2019 suggestion that she has not carefully considered the facts of the investigation. As the members of the House judiciary committee took yet another procedural vote forced by the Republicans on the panel, Trump weighed in on the hearing from London. Speaking to reporters following the Nato summit, Trump questioned Democrats\u2019 loyalty to the US. \u201cYou almost question whether or not they love our country and that\u2019s a very serious thing: Do they love our country?\u201d the president said, according to the pool report. Trump added he considered impeachment to be a \u201cdirty word\u201d that \u201cshould only be used in special occasions.\u201d \u201cThis should never happen to a president again what\u2019s happened here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d Harvard law professor Noah Feldman used his opening statement to argue Trump\u2019s actions, as described during last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee, clearly meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s conduct described in the testimony and evidence clearly constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under the Constitution,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cAccording to the testimony and to the publicly released memorandum of the July 25, 2019, telephone call between the two presidents, President Trump abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election. This act on its own qualifies as an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor.\u201d The witneeses for today\u2019s impeachment hearing have been sworn in, and the first legal expert, Noah Feldman from Harvard law school, has started to deliver his opening statement. But before Feldman could begin speaking, Republicans on the House judiciary committee once again tried to interrupt the hearing with a procedural motion. Chairman Jerry Nadler replied that the motion would be recognized in between the witnesses\u2019 opening statements, and Feldman continued with his prepared remarks. Thirty minutes into the House judiciary committee\u2019s first public impeachment hearing, the panel\u2019s Republican minority forced a vote on a motion to force Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, to testify. A Democratic member of the panel responded by proposing to table (or kill) the motion, which was approved by the committee along party lines. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, closed his opening statement by condemning the impeachment inquiry as a \u201csimple railroad job\u201d against the president. The Georgia Republican claimed the impeachment inquiry began with \u201ctears in Brooklyn,\u201d referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss to Trump. Collins closed out by mildly mocking the witnesses at today\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got law professors here,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWhat a start to a party.\u201d Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House judiciary committee, used his opening statement to reiterate some of the most consistent talking points from the president\u2019s allies. Collins claimed Democrats were only pursuing the impeachment inquiry because they were fearful of Trump\u2019s reelection prospects and had been hellbent on getting the president out of office since he was inaugurated. \u201cIf you want to know what is really driving this: it\u2019s called the clock and the calendar,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey want to do it before the end of the year.\u201d The Georgia Republican also joked that today\u2019s hearing, featuring testimony from legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeachment, would show Americans \u201cwhy most people don\u2019t go to law school.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler closed his opening statement by pushing back against some Republicans\u2019 argument that Democrats should postpone the impeachment investigation, given that the 2020 election is less than a year away. \u201cWe cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis,\u201d Nadler said at the start of his panel\u2019s first public impeachment hearing. \u201cThe integrity of that election is one of the very things at stake.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler pointed to the report from special counsel Robert Mueller, which outlines Trump\u2019s obstruction of his investigation, to argue there is \u201cprecedent for recommending impeachment here.\u201d \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the storm in which we find ourselves today was set in motion by President Trump,\u201d Nadler said in his opening statement. \u201cI do not wish this moment on the country. But we have each taken an oath to protect the Constitution, and the facts before us are clear.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler used his opening statement to outline the accusations against Trump and criticize the president for not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Nadler noted the two other modern presidents who have faced impeachment -- Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton -- turned over considerable evidence to congressional investigators. \u201cPresident Trump, by contrast, has refused to produce a single document and directed every witness not to testify,\u201d Nadler said. Chairman Jerry Nadler could not even begin his opening statement before he was interrupted twice by Republican members of the House judiciary committee raising procedural questions. Viewers of the hearing can expect a lot of those motions from the minority today. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, has gaveled in his panel\u2019s first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry -- which will feature testimony from legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. The first public impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee is set to get underway in just a few minutes, but House Democrats are simultaneously meeting to discuss next steps in the inquiry. Speaker Nancy Pelosi enforced unusually strict rules for members entering the meeting, not even allowing staffers to attend. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to cancel his press conference at the end of the Nato summit prompted surprise and frustration from the reporters gathered in London to pose questions to the president. Meanwhile, over on Capitol Hill, Republicans on the House judiciary committee are following the example of their intelligence committee counterparts by displaying signs disparaging the impeachment inquiry. Trump has just announced that he will depart the Nato summit in London today without holding his press conference, which was scheduled to take place at 10:30 a.m. ET. While taking questions from reporters this morning, Trump had suggested he may cancel the scheduled press conference, but more details were not immediately available from the White House. Now the president has confrmed he will not be holding the press conference after talking to reporters for more than two hours yesterday. But the abrupt decision may have less to do with his lengthy comments yesterday and more so to do with his fellow foreign leaders appearing to mock him yesterday for his rambling press conferences. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied that he, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were mocking Trump yesterday when they were caught on a hot mic joking about someone\u2019s late appearance at an event due to a long press conference. Follow the Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blog for more updates from Jonhson\u2019s press conference at the Nato summit. Today\u2019s impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee will feature testimony from four law professors -- Noah Feldman from Harvard University, Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina, Pamela S. Karlan from Stanford University and Jonathan Turley from George Washington University. The opening statements from the four witnesses were released this morning, and they feature some drastically varying interpretations of the president\u2019s actions, as described during last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee. \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,\u201d Gerhardt intends to say. \u201cNo one, not even the president, is beyond the reach of our Constitution and our laws.\u201d But Turley, the only witnesses called by Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argues in his opening statement that a Trump impeachment could set a dangerous precedent. \u201cI get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad . . . and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad,\u201d Turley intends to say. \u201cWe are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d As the House judiciary committee prepares to hold its first public impeachment hearing, Trump continues to insult world leaders at the Nato summit in London. The US president called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d after the Canadian prime minister was caught on video apparently mocking Trump for his long press conferences. (Trump spoke to reporters for more than two hours yesterday between three different appearances.) \u201cWell, he\u2019s two-faced,\u201d Trump said when asked about the comments by a reporter. But he quickly added, \u201cAnd with Trudeau, he\u2019s a nice guy. I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he\u2019s not paying 2%, and I guess he\u2019s not very happy about it.\u201d During his press conference with Trudeau yesterday, Trump urged Canada to contribute more toward Nato defense spending. In the original video, Trudeau is heard joking to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron, \u201cHe was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top.\u201d Trudeau doesn\u2019t explicitly say Trump\u2019s name, but it seemed to be a clear reference to the US president, given his multiple press conferences yesterday. Good morning, live blog readers! We are about an hour away from the next public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, the first to be held by the House judiciary committee. The hearing will feature testimony from a panel of legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. There is almost 0% chance of any major bombshells coming out of this hearing, unlike last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee. These witnesses will not be providing new details about the Ukraine controversy, instead offering insight into whether the president\u2019s actions (as described at last month\u2019s hearings) would justify impeachment. But according to the opening statements released this morning, the witnesses do not intend to hold back. \u201cThe president\u2019s serious misconduct, including bribery, soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress are worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing,\u201d Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, intends to say. However, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who was called to testify by House Republicans, will argue the allegations against Trump do not meet the Founders\u2019 standard for impeachment and could set a dangerous precedent for the future. These clashing viewpoints -- combined with the combative messaging strategy being pursued by the president\u2019s allies -- could add some fireworks to this morning\u2019s technical legal debate. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on: Trump is still at the Nato summit in London and is scheduled to hold a news conference at 10:30 a.m. ET. The Atlantic Council think tank will hold a discussion on \u201cUS Strategic Interests in Ukraine\u201d with lawmakers at the Capitol. Elizabeth Warren will appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
