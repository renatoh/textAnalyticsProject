A new frontier crossing between the two countries was opened last year, not far from the Albanian town of Shkod\u00ebr. This cut the distance from Bar and Ulcinj by many kilometers, making it practicable to take the coastal route. There is often a long queue to get into Greece from Albania, but if you have an EU passport, let the officials see it; it will speed things up. The trip is highly recommended. Beryl Nicholson \u00b7 In theory, it would be very easy to drive from Croatia to Greece. From Zagreb, good roads to Belgrade, then lead south to Macedonia and then northern Greece. However, most nationalities need visas for travel in Serbia. These cost about \u00a330. Another problem is the instability of the Kosovo/Macedonia region. Travel through Kosovo is very unsafe. The route through Montenegro and Serbia is okay (with a Serbian visa), but roads are poor. The fastest route through Albania is unsafe, as car-jacking and banditry are common, and the roads terrible. Whatever route you take, you may spend hours at borders while your car is searched. Bowden Granville \u00b7 Received wisdom is to avoid Albania, and I think it's worth following. Last autumn, we drove from Croatia, through Bosnia Herzogovina, briefly through the butt end of inland Croatia into Serbia. You pick up the E70 motorway and it's straight south, past Belgrade and eventually into Macedonia and northern Greece. Cons: some of the villages in Bosnia-Herzogovina still bear appalling scars of ethnic cleansing. Entry into Serbia (in the summer) requires a tourist visa, which has to be bought at the border and is expensive (around \u00a350). Pros: all parts of the old Yugoslavia are beautiful and, in our experience, friendly. You end up in northern Greece, which is delightful in itself. Brits are a rarity. PS: The Yugoslav Embassy in London will forward you a useful brochure called 'Driving in Serbia', and the Macedonian Embassy will positively deluge you with free information.
