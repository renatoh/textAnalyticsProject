Boot dryers and foot spas no longer impress. Never mind hot tubs on the balcony and plasma screens, today's luxury chalet needs a cinema, treatment room and a pool. The market leader in fantasy fulfilment is Descent International, which offers Veuve Clicquot on tap and ancestral portraits in the dining room of Baron Bentinck's Klosters home, for \u00a325,000 a week. Hasn't it all got a bit silly? For the skier who wants style, good service and an en suite bathroom, without the frills, Val d'Is\u00e8re chalet specialist VIP offers the oxymoronic concept of affordable luxury. 'We aim to offer 95 per cent of the service for 75 per cent of the price,' says VIP's Andy Sturt. The company's average holiday price is \u00a31,000 a week. Such a precise mission statement invites careful scrutiny. What exactly is the 5 per cent missing? 'Swimming pools and champagne,' says Mr Sturt. 'We're doing more and more cinemas. It's a no-brainer: you soundproof the cellar, cover the walls in velvet, put in a few sofas, et voila ! Children love it and after dinner the grown-ups are glad of the chance to go to sleep in front of a film rather than go out.' The VIP chalets 'Davos', 'Klosters' and 'Madrisah' (collectively, Les Chalets Suisses) are Sturt's latest development, in a panoramic location that is equally inconvenient for skiing and apr\u00e8s-ski. Luckily, Val d'Is\u00e8re is swarming with VIP taxi vans waiting for us to call for a pick-up after skiing. The level of service is impressive, and all the extras are in place: bathrobes, slippers, Molton Brown, state-of-the-art TV and audio systems. Lyndsay King from Vitalitas is here to offer guests reiki apr\u00e8s-ski massages. She offers me an 'in-room' massage but I'm not sure my room is big enough for the purpose - about 15ft by 12ft, including bathroom, with low-flying eaves. The only room big enough is a beautiful double on the lower ground floor, next to the hot tub. Our hatred of the lucky couple who booked this room melts when we realise they have to vacate it for the masseur. I am writing these words on a telephone table at the top of the stairs ventilated by a powerful updraught of garlic as the chalet girls make mayo for the evening canap\u00e9s. Handsomely built and stylishly decorated Chalet Davos is. But the lap of luxury skiing it isn't. In a place such as Val d'Is\u00e8re, the greatest luxury is space. The Farmhouse, a beautiful old house in the centre of the resort, is a dream chalet for eight_ that sleeps 12 to 14. Bellevarde seems bigger and lighter, but its bedrooms too are small. Better still, for those who value legroom, are VIP's Aspen Lodge suites in a big new hotel-like development on the main street. For many, the proof of a chalet holiday is in the eating and drinking. VIP fare does little to undermine the theory that in chalet holidays, you get what you pay for. VIP vin is honest C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne and vin de pays, with more exciting bottles available for a supplement. Fish pie with broccoli is filling and well presented, without setting the skiing gourmet's taste buds a-tingle. Having sampled more than my fair share of the competition's product, I would not go so far as to say that VIP delivers 95 per cent of it: somewhere between 70 and 80 per cent might be closer to the mark. It is a compromise, and a good one, for those of us who value good service but do not need the titillation of supreme self-indulgence. Don't forget to pack your ski helmet, though. It could save you from a nasty injury in the bedroom. VIP: 08701 123119; www.vip-chalets.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
