The ruling Shia and Kurdish blocs voted to restore the original rules, giving Sunni Arabs a small but real chance of torpedoing the constitution on October 15. The U-turn averted a Sunni boycott of the poll, which is supposed to legitimise a new social contract for a deeply divided nation. \"With this result, the Sunni Arabs will be able to defeat the constitution, if there is honesty and an international supervision on the process,\" said Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni spokesman. \"I am sure if there is honesty, 95% of Sunni Arabs will vote no.\" American diplomats, keen for a yes vote but alarmed that the poll's credibility could evaporate before a ballot paper was ticked, were relieved. Michael Schulenburg, deputy head of the UN mission in Iraq, said: \"We're very happy about the national assembly's action. We will now have a referendum law that follows international standards. It provides the ground for a fair referendum, and we call on all Iraqis to come forward to use a democratic right to give their opinion.\" On Sunday, parliament amended voting rules to make it more difficult for the restive Sunnis, who make up a fifth of the population, to muster sufficient majorities in three provinces to kill the charter. After pressure from US and UN officials, moderates in the Shia and Kurdish coalitions persuaded colleagues to back down and, after a brief debate yesterday, MPs voted 119 to 28 to restore the original rules. \"The government is completely keen to make the constitutional process legitimate and of high credibility and we are concerned about the success of this process rather than the results of the referendum,\" said a government spokesman, Leith Kubba. Nevertheless, the climbdown reflected a belief - shared by the Americans as well most Iraqi analysts - that the constitution will pass even under the original rules. Sunnis reject the charter as a betrayal of Iraq's Arab identity and as a recipe for disintegration which will maroon their community between an oil-rich, autonomous Kurdish north and Shia south. If two-thirds vote no in three of Iraq's 18 provinces, the charter falls. Sunnis have majorities in at least three provinces but mustering 66% will be difficult. Shias and Kurds have made the task of their rivals harder by defining voter to mean registered voter, as opposed to those who actually vote. They defined voter in a different way when calculating the national tally, where a verdict requires a simple majority, to increase the likelihood of a yes vote. The UN said the double standard was unacceptable. President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, defended the change as consistent with the transitional constitution, but other government figures said it would enrage Sunnis. However, American military commanders admitted this week that Sunnis are likely to brand the charter illegitimate, even if it passes under the original rules, raising the prospect that a document intended to unify the country could achieve the opposite. About 5m copies of the constitution are being distributed across Iraq with ballot papers, polling boxes and voter screens. Having forfeited representation in parliament by boycotting January's election, Sunnis appear keen to be heard next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
