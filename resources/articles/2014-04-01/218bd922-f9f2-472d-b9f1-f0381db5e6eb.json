Retailers and transport firms will use the savings to expand their businesses, while households increase spending on other services, the study says. The increase in investment and higher spending will generate enough extra VAT and income tax receipts to make up most of the losses from expected fuel duty rises. In what is likely to prove a controversial report, Treasury officials argue that the short-term gains that have been measured since the freeze was put into place in 2010 will extend for decades, boosting GDP to higher levels than previously estimated. The report is the second in a series examining the effects of tax cuts brought in by the coalition government. It follows a similar attempt to measure the long-term cost and benefits of cutting corporation tax, which has fallen in four years from 28% to 21%. Fuel duty generates \u00a326bn in receipts each year and is the fifth biggest source of income for the government. At present petrol and diesel are charged duty at 57.95p. When VAT is included, tax represents just under 60% of the final pump price. The coalition has frozen the fuel duty escalator on petrol and diesel that was brought in by the previous administration as a green tax during the 1990s. By raising fuel duty by 1p above inflation every year it ensured tax became a large proportion of petrol pump prices, but since 2010 the proportion has fallen steeply. The Treasury has worked with the tax office using behavioural economics and detailed modelling to conclude GDP would increase by between 0.3% and 0.5% over the next 20 years \u2013 a rise worth \u00a34.5bn to \u00a37.5bn in today's prices. Over the same period investment will be 2% higher, regaining around half of the initial loss of revenue to the exchequer from scraping the escalator. The report is expected to cause a furore among environmental groups, which supported the fuel duty escalator as a way to limit the greenhouse gas emissions from car use. Economists will want to examine the assumptions made in the report and how the Treasury's officials calculate the effects over the next 20 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
