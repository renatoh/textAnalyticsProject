In a carefully worded, at times almost evangelical, interview with United's in-house television station MUTV, he attempted to defuse almost every fear supporters harbour about the recent takeover of the club, orchestrated by his father Malcolm. In a piece of textbook, if somewhat schmaltzy, PR which saw him press every diplomatic button, Joel disarmed the doubters by presenting his family as change-resistant, caring capitalists who, far from regarding history as bunk, are enthralled by United's heritage. Casting themselves as \"restorers\" of the club, he stressed that true \"ownership\" resided with United's fans who, contrary to widespread rumour, would not be \"priced out\" of watching the team. Although he and his two brothers will have seats on the board, Joel depicted them as staunch supporters of Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager, and David Gill, the chief executive. Dismissing speculation that Ferguson's transfer budget will be capped, Glazer said: \"It's absolutely not true. We are here to provide the manager with what he needs to compete and win at the highest level.\" Ferguson has reportedly confided to friends that he is excited about the new regime and, while accepting he is under pressure, believes things will \"be much better than before\". This honeymoon mood appears mutual. As Glazer put it: \"Manchester United are very, very fortunate to have the most wonderful manager in Sir Alex Ferguson. He's just done a tremendous, tremendous job and we have the greatest, greatest respect for him and hope to work with him for many, many years to come.\" Expressing similar enthusiasm for Gill and pronouncing himself horrified at false suggestions his family want to sever United's links with Sir Bobby Charlton - with whom he also envisages working for \"many, many\" years - Glazer said \"absolutely nothing will change; I'm very adverse [sic] to change.\" Talk that Old Trafford would be sold and leased back to the club was therefore \"absolutely ridiculous\" as are suggestions that the family would seek to forge an independent, break-away, television deal for United. On the contrary they are fans of collective bargaining. \"You know in our league in the US there's even more sharing of money than we have here and that's the foundation of the league. Without a strong league you don't have strong competition and we feel very strongly about that.\" Ditto ticket prices. \"This club's ticket prices will always be competitive with other prices in the Premier League,\" he pledged. \"We are not looking to outprice supporters because when you do that you lose the lifeblood of the club. So we are very, very sensitive about that. This game has to remain affordable for everybody.\" Glazer also emphasised football's emotional importance. \"What we always say about our club in Tampa [The Buccaneers] is that the supporters are the owners of the club and we are the restorers. We have the utmost respect for the traditions and history of Manchester United. \"It all starts with the supporters because without their support and their passion there is no game. We have to reach out and treat them the best way we know how to treat them.\" According to Glazer United's reversion from plc status to private ownership should make it less opaque. \"People want to know what's happening and we will be communicating,\" he said. \"We apologise we haven't been able to speak out directly before.\" He did not, however, say too much about the gargantuan borrowing which has characterised the Glazer coup, merely commenting: \"Our family has personally invested \u00a3270m\" and \"debt means different things to different people\". A similar vagueness applied to questions about new commercial activities. \"Maybe there are some things we can do overseas to grow Manchester United which will benefit the community at large,\" he said. He might have found the going tougher in front of a roomful of reporters but if he ever did become bored with United, Joel Glazer could surely carve a career in politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
