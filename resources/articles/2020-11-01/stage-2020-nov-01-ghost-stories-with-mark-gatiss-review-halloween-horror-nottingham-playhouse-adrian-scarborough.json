Each of the four stories handpicked by Mark Gatiss to be read aloud for this Halloween event at Nottingham Playhouse dwell on our fear of death and of the undead, but also convey the terrible exhilaration that comes from hearing supernatural stories in a collective campfire-like huddle. On a dimly lit stage, pumpkins and old leather chairs create an ambience. And as Gatiss starts to read from a lectern, his voice doing all the dramatising, an almost instant creepiness pervades the stage despite the glare of daylight outside (in the matinee show). This is theatre stripped to its storytelling bones and it is received with the childlike pleasure of a bedtime read, albeit a bumpy one. Gatiss has proved himself a master of the macabre but the scary stories of old here are not the most baroque, or even the best known: there is no MR James, Edgar Allan Poe or even Lovecraft. He begins with HG Wells\u2019s The Red Room, which deploys the customary tropes and symbols of horror writing \u2013 candlesticks, spiral staircases, withered hands and shadows that creep around a brave young cynic who spends the night in an allegedly haunted room. But these come wrapped in brilliant writing (\u201cgerminating darkness\u201d; \u201cgaunt silences\u201d) and artfully constructed atmosphere. He is joined on stage by Adrian Scarborough, with whom he established an actorly chemistry two years ago in Alan Bennett\u2019s The Madness of George III. While Gatiss\u2019s stories are relatively muscular, of a ghost investigator in Nigel Kneale\u2019s The Patter of Tiny Feet and the young man of \u201cscientific mind\u201d in HG Wells\u2019s story, Scarborough encapsulates female subjectivities in his two tales (Jade Anouka was to be the show\u2019s other reader before withdrawing because of \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d). Scarborough\u2019s delivery is as expressive as Gatiss\u2019s, if not more so. He reads Rosemary Timperley\u2019s mournful Harry, of a child snatched from her mother by a ghost, and Richard Matheson\u2019s Long Distance Call, about an ailing woman who faces a metaphorical confrontation with her own mortality when she begins receiving phone-calls from the \u201cother side\u201d. Like the best kind of horror, both these tales are underpinned by Freudian double meanings. But \u201cno amount of rationalisation, reform, or Freudian analysis can quite annul the thrill of the chimney-corner whisper or the lonely wood\u201d, wrote Lovecraft, and every story here comes with thrills, spills and a punchy pay-off. Horror brings the promise of physical reactions, too, and there is a certain wishfulness for those of us watching online \u2013 the show can be seen live or live streamed \u2013 to be experiencing it together, inside the auditorium. \u201cLong live the theatre,\u201d says Gatiss, after reading the final, impish, poem, Antigonish by William Hughes Mearns, and his words are moving, given the blows of lockdowns over the past eight months and the shuddering uncertainty to come. Ghost Stories with Mark Gatiss was part of Unlocked festival at Nottingham Playhouse, which runs until 9 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
