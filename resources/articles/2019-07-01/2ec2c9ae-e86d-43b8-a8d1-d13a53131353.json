In a message to all Foreign Office staff that will be seen as a coded rebuke to Boris Johnson, Hunt praised the departing ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, hailing him and his diplomatic colleagues as \u201cthe best of Britain\u201d. \u201cThe twin roles you perform of speaking truth to power and standing up for British interests have never been more vital,\u201d wrote Hunt, the foreign secretary, on Thursday. \u201cPlease keep speaking up without fear or favour, remembering that the UK government alone will determine appointments based on our national interest alone.\u201d He added: \u201cI want you to know that you will always get all the support you need to carry out your vital work. I will ensure you get it.\u201d The reassuring missive was released after a day in which Johnson, the clear favourite to become the new prime minister, faced intense criticism from Conservative party colleagues over his perceived abandonment of Darroch. At a Tory leadership hustings on Thursday evening, Johnson claimed he fully supports Darroch, despite his previous repeated public refusals to do so. He told the audience: \u201cI rang Kim, I think yesterday, and said how much I regretted his resignation, which indeed I do. He, I think, was the victim of a very unpleasant stunt by somebody who tried to \u2013 and succeeded in \u2013 leaking his confidential diptels [diplomatic communications], which are intended to guide ministers and the government about his thoughts about what\u2019s going on in Washington. \u201cAnd I think it was absolutely disgraceful that those diptels were leaked and I think it is vital \u2013 and as I said to Kim and I say to everybody \u2013 that all our civil servants, all great ambassadors such as Sir Kim, should feel free to speak without fear or favour to their political masters and then it is up to their political masters to decide what to do with it. And I think whoever leaked that, those diptels, deserves to be hunted down and prosecuted.\u201d Asked why he had been less willing to offer such clear public backing before Darroch felt moved to resign, Johnson said: \u201cI must say that I think there has certainly been an attempt to politicise this issue and to take the career prospects of Sir Kim and turn them into an issue in the Conservative leadership contest. I notice that. \u201cWhat I will say is that I don\u2019t think that should happen and, as I said in the debate, I don\u2019t think that issues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversations and just as the advice that civil servants give to ministers should be sacrosanct and ministers should not reveal it and should not betray it.\u201d In the background, there is also a fierce wrangle over who should replace Darroch in Washington and, crucially, whether the decision should be taken by May or her successor. At an urgent Commons question about the affair, a series of Tory MPs lined up to criticise Johnson, who repeatedly refused to back Darroch after Trump insulted the ambassador in a series of tweets and said he would no longer deal with him. One Conservative backbencher, David Morris, said Johnson, a former foreign secretary, should make a formal apology to parliament. \u201cDo you not feel that it is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants, and the honourable member for Uxbridge should come to the house and apologise?\u201d he asked. Adding to the likely discomfort of the Johnson camp, the Foreign Office minister tasked with responding to the urgent question was Sir Alan Duncan, who had the day before accused Johnson of throwing Darroch \u201cunder the bus\u201d. Johnson has praised Darroch but stayed otherwise silent after declining several times during a Tory leadership TV debate on Tuesday night to offer support, something friends of Darroch said was a key element in the ambassador\u2019s decision to resign the next day. One of Johnson\u2019s leading allies, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, spoke up for him on Thursday, telling a journalists\u2019 lunch that while she did not like overseas leaders such as Trump \u201cslagging off\u201d the UK, she agreed with the US president\u2019s criticism of May\u2019s Brexit deal. On the timing for appointing a new ambassador, Truss predicted this would take months and so it would be a job for the next prime minister. On Thursday evening, Johnson talked up the importance of the maintaining a working relationship with Washington, but insisted that there were circumstances in which he would publicly criticise Trump. He pointed to his response to Trump\u2019s claim in 2015 that some parts of London were \u201cso radicalised that police are afraid for their own lives\u201d. At the time, Johnson noted, he had replied that the \u201conly reason I wouldn\u2019t go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump\u201d. That came after other Tories had been openly critical of him. During the urgent question, one Conservative MP, Roger Gale, told the Commons: \u201cThe failure of the former foreign secretary to leap to the defence of Sir Kim shows a lack of leadership that is lamentable.\u201d Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was less direct, but made his feelings known, saying the loss of Darroch after Trump\u2019s comments amounted to the UK being bullied. Tugendhat said the government should \u201calways stand up for those we send abroad, military or civilian, and will back them to the point that is necessary in the interests of the British people, and no one else\u201d. The only support for Johnson in parliament came from the veteran Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who said: \u201cThe attacking of colleagues is completely wrong and people should be ashamed of themselves when they\u2019ve done that.\u201d The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden, who said the decision of Darroch to resign, despite having the full support of Theresa May and her cabinet, was \u201ca dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom\u201d. McFadden said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201can appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line\u201d. He added: \u201cReal leaders protect their people, they don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions are a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister.\u201d Duncan said he would not be responding to such views on Johnson: \u201cI hope the house will understand if I hold back today from making any further comment on the right honourable friend the member for Uxbridge. I said enough yesterday to make my position entirely clear.\u201d Duncan nonetheless managed to reiterate his condemnation of Johnson several times in ways varying from the coded to the open. Responding to one question, he replied: \u201cIt is everyone\u2019s duty, and everyone in this house\u2019s duty, to defend our ambassadors. They are our ambassadors doing our duty. If they do something terribly wrong or break all the rules, that\u2019s altogether different.\u201d Duncan later drew laughter after the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, cited his description of Johnson\u2019s actions as \u201cthe behaviour of an utter wimp\u201d. \u201cI seem to recall that was one of the kinder words I used yesterday,\u201d he told MPs, adding: \u201cI think what I would rather do is concentrate on the specific details of the question put, the merits of Sir Kim Darroch rather than the \u2026 merits of anyone else.\u201d Predictions about who will fill the role have already begun, with names mentioned including Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service. The appointment would help smooth the return to the cabinet of Gavin Williamson under Johnson, whose campaign he has helped run. Sedwill played a leading role in Williamson\u2019s dismissal as defence secretary in May after an inquiry found he had leaked information about the role of Huawei in the UK\u2019s 5G network. Political figures named as possible successor include the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, the international trade secretary Liam Fox, and the chancellor-turned man-of-many-jobs George Osborne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
