Opposed Iraq war. Euroenthusiast (but hoping not too many Tories care). Hobbies Montecristo No 3 cigars, watching cricket, football, Formula 1; reading history and political biographies. Going for him A genuine big beast (former Health, Education, Home Secretary and Chancellor); widely liked by non-Tories. Going against Tories, still with big problems on Europe, choose the leader. Other half Gillian, famously good at making quilts and a perfect match in Britain's most defiantly unspun political couple. Refuses all requests for interviews. Most likely to say 'I scare the pants off Labour.' Least likely to say 'Excuse me, sir, but don't you know this is a non-smoking carriage?' David Davis Age 56 Political platform Right-of-centre on tax and social issues, but also big on 'creating an opportunity society'. Eurosceptic. Hobbies Country walking, flying (in a plane); becoming Tory leader. Going for him Succeeded the un-posh way: raised by a single mother in a council flat. Plus a spell in the SAS, which could come in useful for party discipline. Accomplished TV performer. Going against More feared than loved by many MPs. Better on TV than on a platform; critics say he is lazy. Other half Doreen - university sweetheart, soulmate - who also runs his parliamentary office. Most likely to say 'Fancy a yomp?' Least likely to say 'Hey, it's only politics, I don't mind who wins.' David Cameron Age 38 Political platform Determined to rescue the Conservative 'brand' by championing values in tune with 'modern Britain'. Eurosceptic (particularly when comparing himself to Clarke). Hobbies Horse-riding, tennis, gardening, with a famous line in marrows. Going for him Young, energetic, polished public performer - all on show last week in upstaging David Davis's campaign launch. Going against Young... and oh-so-posh, as in Eton and Oxford. Other half Samantha, who as creative director is credited with reinventing the Bond Street stationers Smythson in a Palm Pilot age. Baby number three imminent. Most likely to say 'A modern Conservative Party for a modern country.' Least likely to say 'I'll be daaaarn the Dog and Duck havvin' a pint of stout.' Liam Fox Age 43 Political platform Classic right-wing Tory: small government, low taxes, family values, favours tighter abortion time-limits, firmly Eurosceptic - yet with strong emphasis on social responsibility. Hobbies Skiing, tennis, diving. Going for him Had a real job (as a doctor) before going into politics. Personable and charming, particularly in informal discussions. Going against Charm gets lost in set-piece speeches and on TV. Other half (almost) Fiancee Jesme Baird, a cancer specialist at a lung-cancer foundation (not wise to seat next to Ken Clarke at a candidates' party). Most likely to say 'Set people free, get the state off their back.' Least likely to say 'Let's legalise dope if everyone's smoking it anyway.' Malcom Rifkind Age59 Political platform Classic 'One Nation Tory,' with particular emphasis on helping disadvantaged. Opposed Iraq war. Eurosceptic (particularly when comparing himself to Clarke). Hobbies Politics (missed the Commons so much that he spent eight years out of Parliament rather than settle for a sure seat in the Lords). Relaxing with wife Edith, particularly back in his native Edinburgh. Going for him Personable, charming, widely liked - even by MPs backing other candidates: almost everybody's second choice. Going against Almost everybody's second choice, seems old even though he's younger than Clarke. Other half Edith, heroically supportive, not least since she has suffered from the effects of MS in recent years. Most likely to say 'What time's the train north?' Least likely to say: 'Has anyone got a number for Ali G?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
