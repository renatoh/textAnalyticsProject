Sky, headed by James Murdoch, fears the move by Brussels' competition watchdog may prompt many of their 7.8 million subscribers to switch providers, while Premier League chiefs believe it could send their vital \u00a31.6 billion TV income plummeting. Officials in the EC's competition directorate have told the league that, under their next broadcasting deal, starting in 2007, no one station should show more than half the live matches screened. Brussels is determined to end Sky's 13-year monopoly, which it believes is bad for both consumers and rival operators such as NTL, Telewest and Setanta. Neelie Kroes, the EC's Competition Commissioner, is taking a tough stance after research by Ofcom, Britain's broadcasting regulator, showed viewers and fans resented Sky's stranglehold and wanted more choice. Sky will show all 138 televised matches from the Premier League this season. Broadcasting analysts say its ability to show 'live and exclusive' fixtures since 1992 has been its single biggest help in building up a lucrative army of subscribers, who each pay up to \u00a340 a month. The PL is resisting Brussels' demand, which it claims is tantamount to 'fixing the market', could lead to broadcasters colluding with each other in order to pay lower than real market rates for rights, and is based on Ofcom research it privately derides as 'sixth-form essay standard nonsense'. 'If 50 per cent of the live rights go to another broadcaster, Sky could really suffer because there could be an exodus of their subscribers,' said a source close to the negotiations between PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and Kroes's key aides. Luc de Hert, EC competition spokesman, said this weekend: 'The FA Premier League has made certain proposals, but we do not regard them as satisfactory. 'The commissioner will shortly send a letter explaining that she considers the recent FAPL proposals not acceptable and inviting them to come up with a more satisfactory solution at short notice.' The league has already agreed that at least one other broadcaster apart from Sky will be able to show some games from 2007. But it is understood to be trying to ensure that far fewer than half the 138 matches are screened elsewhere. The 20 clubs fear that were Sky suddenly faced with a serious competitor, it would pay far less than its current three-year \u00a31.1bn deal. Analysts say Sky's business would not suffer unduly if a rival captured no more than 30-40 games. A Sky spokesman said: 'We think we will be able to bid competitively for whatever rights are available.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
