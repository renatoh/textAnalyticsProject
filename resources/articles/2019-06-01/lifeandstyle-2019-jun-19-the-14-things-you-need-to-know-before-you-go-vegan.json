The environmental and ethical case for a diet free of all animal products, including meat, fish, dairy and eggs, is compelling. According to research from the University of Oxford, going vegan is the \u201csingle biggest way\u201d to reduce your impact on the planet. And that is before you consider the ethical arguments against eating industrially farmed animals, which have an appalling quality of life and are often pumped full of powerful antibiotics that may pose a risk to human health. But if you are a lifelong meat-eater, it is hard to know where to start. We asked some leading vegans for their advice for adults who want to make the transition. Should you jump right in? Or is it better to dip your toe into a plant-based diet first? \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a right answer about whether to do it immediately or not,\u201d says Henry Firth, one half of the vegan social-media sensation Bosh!. \u201cIt\u2019s about what\u2019s right for you and what\u2019s sustainable for your lifestyle.\u201d Some experts suggest easing into veganism via a sightseeing tour of the world of vegetarianism, while others favour going cold tofu. Katy Beskow, a longtime vegan and the author of three bestselling cookbooks, suggests a gradual approach. \u201cThe availability of vegan products means you can do it so much more easily than before. My advice is to replace products in your diet with alternatives step by step, be it milk, mayonnaise or yoghurt. That way, you won\u2019t see a difference.\u201d How do I deal with negative responses from meat-loving family and friends? Kill the haters with kindness \u2013 and delicious food. \u201cYou can make your meat jokes or tell me I\u2019m going to die, but I\u2019m comfortable with my decision,\u201d says the author and columnist Isa Chandra Moskowitz. \u201cTreat people with kindness, even if they are being jerks. And cook for them \u2013 you get to show them how yummy things are. It\u2019s a really beautiful gesture that stops people from being aggressive and helps them to see that the food is good \u2013 and you\u2019re OK.\u201d Be empathic towards people expressing negative attitudes. \u201cI can understand when people have some negativity towards veganism because I was in that position once,\u201d says the YouTuber, chef and author Gaz Oakley. \u201cIt was just fear of the unknown and not being educated on the matter.\u201d Treat such encounters as a teaching opportunity \u2013 but don\u2019t lecture people. \u201cIf I\u2019m at a party and someone makes a little dig about veganism, it\u2019s just about educating them and making them feel at ease. Say stuff such as: \u2018I never thought I would be a vegan until I saw this or found out this.\u2019 Don\u2019t be judgmental or argue back. Just try to educate them as best you can.\u201d Humour helps. \u201cI remember doing a TV programme once where someone asked me: \u2018How bad are your farts because you\u2019re a vegan?\u2019\u201d says the poet, actor and musician Benjamin Zephaniah. \u201cI said: \u2018Your farts smell of dead, rotting flesh. My farts smell like broccoli. Don\u2019t worry about mine, man \u2013 think about yours.\u2019\u201d How do I make sure I am getting enough protein? \u201cIt\u2019s the only time people ever ask you about protein, when you go vegan,\u201d Beskow says. \u201cProtein deficiency is a really rare thing in the western world. It\u2019s just about combining protein such as beans, pulses, seeds and nuts. It sounds as if you\u2019re eating rabbit food, but you\u2019re not. You can just sprinkle a handful of toasted pine nuts over some pasta or add a can of beans into your chilli.\u201d Heather Russell, a registered dietician at the Vegan Society, says there is no cause for concern. \u201cA common myth is that it\u2019s difficult to get protein from plant foods. In reality, they can provide all the essential protein building blocks that we call amino acids. Good sources include beans, lentils, chickpeas, soya products, peanut butter, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds.\u201d What about vitamins and minerals? If you are going vegan, it is important to make sure you get enough vitamin B12 \u2013 commonly found in meat, eggs and fish \u2013 as without it, you will feel exhausted and weak. You can get B12 from fortified foods including \u201cdairy alternatives, breakfast cereal, dairy-free spread and yeast extract\u201d, says Russell. Alternatively, you can take a B12 supplement, which you can buy in most pharmacies and health-food stores. Russell also advises you think about your calcium intake. \u201cFortified plant milk contains the same amount of calcium as cow\u2019s milk, and fortified yoghurt alternatives, calcium-set tofu, and a soya and linseed bread fortified with extra calcium are also really rich sources.\u201d Veganism seems expensive. How do I make a plant-based diet affordable? Zephaniah hears this a lot. \u201cI speak to single parents who say: \u2018When I\u2019m going down to the supermarket, you think I\u2019ve got time to go and nip into a health food store and read all the labels? I\u2019ve got three kids in tow!\u2019\u201d He tries to allay their concerns. \u201cBasically, we want fruit, vegetables and lentils of various kinds. Forget about all the posh cuisines and all that stuff. That\u2019s all right if you\u2019ve got the money for it. But veganism, in principle, should be really cheap.\u201d If you are on a limited budget, steer clear of processed foods. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that vegan food has to be expensive,\u201d says Firth. \u201cIn order to keep it cheap, though, it\u2019s a good idea to avoid products that even say \u2018vegan\u2019 on them. So you\u2019re not going to go to the expensive supermarkets and buy products in plastic that have been made in labs or factories; they\u2019re going to be expensive. You\u2019re just going to go back to basics and eat fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts and beans \u2013 and you are going to be incredibly healthy, as well as saving money.\u201d Do I have to give up going to dinner at other people\u2019s houses? That depends on whether you trust them to respect your dietary preferences. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to a friend\u2019s house who really respects my veganism and will make the effort to look after me, I will,\u201d Zephaniah says. \u201cBut, on the whole, I don\u2019t want people to bend over backwards for me, so I\u2019ll say: \u2018Let\u2019s go out,\u2019 or: \u2018I\u2019ll come round and you have your dinner and we\u2019ll have some drinks.\u2019\u201d A good approach for any well-mannered guest is to offer to bring a vegan dish with them. \u201cBy offering to bring some food, you\u2019re contributing and you\u2019re getting a chance to show delicious food to everyone who is not vegan, as well as taking the stress or annoyance out of the hands of the host,\u201d says Firth. If the host prefers to cook, remind them of what you can and can\u2019t eat \u2013 animal products have a way of slipping into things \u2013 so that they don\u2019t accidentally put fish sauce in your curry. You may even want to suggest a recipe for them to try. But the most important thing is to have a frank conversation with your host before you turn up at their front door. \u201cThe one thing you don\u2019t want to do is just turn up without having made a plan or had a conversation,\u201d says Firth. \u201cThat\u2019s going to annoy anyone.\u201d What should I do if I have a wobble and really crave some meat? Breaking a decades-long attachment to the smells, flavours and textures of meat can be hard. Perhaps you are hungover and craving a bacon sandwich or at a barbecue when the smell of sausages wafts over to you. The good news is that nowadays it is easy to recreate the flavours and textures of meat in vegan food, whether it is a plant-based burger that bleeds like real meat, jackfruit \u201cpulled pork\u201d or seitan with the texture and crunch of fried chicken. \u201cIn my recipes and YouTube videos, often I recreate certain dishes, whether it\u2019s vegan chicken, beefsteaks or turkey \u2013 whatever else I can veganise,\u201d says Oakley. \u201cYou can get that same texture and taste when you\u2019re vegan. You\u2019re spoilt for choice these days. You can get chicken, ribs, bacon, steaks, burgers, sausages \u2013 everything is available. When I went vegan four years ago, those things weren\u2019t there.\u201d What if I am not that keen on eating plants? \u201cEat familiar recipes and replace ingredients with plant-based alternatives,\u201d says Beskow. Take shepherd\u2019s pie: \u201cInstead of mince, you can use a can of green lentils. That way, you are getting some of your five a day because you have onion, carrot and celery, just as you would with any shepherd\u2019s pie, but you\u2019re hiding those lentils in there.\u201d If you simply cannot eat your greens, do as parents of toddlers do and puree some vegetables, then bung them in a pasta sauce. But you are going to have to get over your vegetable phobia at some point. \u201cVegan or not, you should be working vegetables into your life,\u201d says Moskowitz. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good to say: \u2018I don\u2019t like any vegetables, so I can\u2019t go vegan.\u2019 You\u2019re going to have trouble actually living.\u201d Is it difficult to maintain a healthy weight on a vegan diet? If you only eat salad, perhaps \u2013 but what a joyless life that would be. \u201cWell-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages,\u201d says Russell. \u201cThey can provide all the calories and nutrients needed to hit nutritional targets and maintain a healthy weight.\u201d Being vegan doesn\u2019t mean you are on a diet. Beskow urges converts to indulge in all their favourite treats from their pre-vegan lifestyle, in moderation. \u201cIf you are used to eating biscuits, you can buy lots of biscuits in supermarkets that are accidentally vegan \u2026 Have some crisps, enjoy your food \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. People see veganism as so restrictive and about saying no, but it\u2019s about saying yes \u2013 but to different things.\u201d It is difficult to find vegan options where I live. How can I keep my diet varied and interesting? If you are fortunate enough to have access to a garden or an allotment, get out there. Growing your own fruit and vegetables can be a great way to keep a vegan diet interesting. \u201cI live in the middle of a field in Lincolnshire,\u201d says Zephaniah. He has devoted a part of his garden to growing vegetables; in summer, he always has a glut. \u201cI hardly have to go to a supermarket \u2013 I\u2019ve got too much food. I have to give it away to the neighbours.\u201d Firth says: \u201cYou don\u2019t need loads and loads of quirky ingredients. You can get a few base ingredients from your local shop and cook up thousands of delicious treats.\u201d Most supermarkets, even in rural areas, will be able to cater to vegan diets. \u201cI live in east Yorkshire and we don\u2019t have any specialist vegan shops around us,\u201d says Beskow. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK because I don\u2019t tend to shop in health-food shops or vegan shops anyway. Everything that I need is in the supermarket or the local market.\u201d She advises following the Instagram account Accidentally Vegan, which uploads supermarket products that happen to be vegan. What if my partner doesn\u2019t want to go vegan? Will it affect our relationship? Let\u2019s face it: all couples do these days is eat food in front of box sets. But what if your partner is an avowed steak-eater? Will it affect your relationship? Not necessarily, says Moskowitz. \u201cFind food you both like, eat separately, do whatever you have to do. There are lots of relationships where people have different political ideologies; most people have other things in common and that\u2019s the reason they\u2019re together.\u201d Beskow\u2019s fiance isn\u2019t a vegan, but they muddle through: he doesn\u2019t cook meat at home, but will eat meat when they go out for dinner. \u201cI think it\u2019s about making food you are both happy with, so they\u2019re not missing out on anything.\u201d What about children? Is veganism safe for them? Children can be healthy vegans. \u201cIt is possible to provide all the nutrients needed for growth and development without animal products,\u201d Russell says. She advises parents to consult the Vegan Society website, which has detailed guidance on vegan diets for children of all ages, including infants, and can offer advice on which fortified foods and supplements it may be necessary for them to take. What are your favourite very simple vegan recipes? Bosh!\u2019s Ian Theasby suggests a simple pasta dish: take vegetables, roast them in olive oil for half an hour, take them out of the oven and cover them with tinned tomatoes, then stick them back in for another 10 minutes. \u201cWhat you are left with is an extremely tasty, really nutritious pasta sauce that will satisfy anybody.\u201d Oakley suggests learning how to make a simple ramen. \u201cStir-fry some vegan protein, whether it\u2019s tofu or vegan chicken, along with some vegetables. Get a nice vegetable stock, squeeze some miso paste in there, add some soy sauce and chilli, and throw in some noodles. You\u2019ve got a quick ramen that takes you about 15 minutes.\u201d What if I slip up and break my vegan streak? Should I just give up? We\u2019re only human and we make mistakes. If you do end up eating some meat, take the time to rediscover why you went vegan in the first place. \u201cDon\u2019t get too down about it,\u201d says Oakley. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a vegan world yet. It may even be out of your hands: perhaps you are given something that isn\u2019t vegan. But refer back to the initial thing that made you go vegan. Get your real motivation and you won\u2019t slip up.\u201d The crucial thing, all the experts agree, is not to beat yourself up about it. \u201cVegans aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d says Zephaniah. \u201cWe just think it\u2019s worth it. We\u2019re trying to do the most good and the least harm. And that\u2019s the best you can do. So just keep trying.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
