The 19-year-old excelled in both legs of the quarter-final and insists a sixth European Cup triumph is a realistic aim for Liverpool given the manner of their 5-1 aggregate defeat of the runaway Premier League leaders. Alexander-Arnold, who was nine the last time Liverpool reached the Champions League semi-finals, scored the opening goal of an unbeaten campaign by J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team in the play-off win at Hoffenheim. He claims there is no team, past or potential, in the competition who intimidate Liverpool. \u201cThroughout the whole tournament there hasn\u2019t been a team who strike fear in us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at it from the start that we\u2019re in it to win it. As it goes on, you get closer and closer to getting that chance to win it. We\u2019ve taken another step closer to the final and there are still two more games ahead of us. Whoever we draw on Friday, we\u2019ll look forward to the game and hopefully get to the final.\u201d The defender\u2019s confidence was echoed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who believes the City victory will have an impact on the remainder of Liverpool\u2019s season. \u201cTo beat City twice is no easy feat,\u201d the England midfielder said. \u201cWe did it twice in a week and earlier this season. It shows us that when we are at the races and at the right level we can beat anyone in this league. Hopefully now it is on us \u2013 whoever we get in the next round \u2013 to prove we can beat anyone in Europe as well.\u201d Pep Guardiola and his team sought to exploit Alexander-Arnold\u2019s inexperience in the quarter-final, particularly in the first leg at Anfield, only for the Liverpool-born defender to thrive in his duel with Leroy San\u00e9. \u201cI guess Man City looked at it and felt I was the weak link,\u201d the teenager said. \u201cMaybe that gave me that underdog mentality and I tried to prove them wrong. That\u2019s what I went out to try and do \u2013 prove them wrong and show them I\u2019m not the weak link in the team. \u201cI think over the two legs I did my best to win my personal battles and help us win the tie. It was a different test for me. It was a bigger, harder test. I had to play to a better level than I\u2019ve probably ever played before. It tested me to a new level and now I know that I\u2019ve got that in me. That is the level I need from myself to keep my standards really high and to hopefully be able to play in these elite European games and come out on top.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
