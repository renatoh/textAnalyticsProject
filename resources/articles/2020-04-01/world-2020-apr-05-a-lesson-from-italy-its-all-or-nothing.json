Covid-19 is so contagious that I believe an all-or-nothing crackdown is the only one that works, and I am disappointed that the media continue to use words like \u201cdraconian\u201d (Sunshine on way to UK but health officials stress: stay home, 2 April). I live in Italy and can be fined \u20ac1,000 or slung in jail for up to three months if I leave my village without good reason. The UK, unlike Italy, had the benefit of studying precedents and could have locked down from the start. I predict that in a week or two everyone with any concept of self-preservation in the UK will be safely cowering behind their doors \u2013 including those bleating about the erosion of their freedoms \u2013 while only brave hospital staff, carers, emergency service workers, volunteers and public servants will be out risking their lives to help the many. Florence Nightingale knew about zero tolerance when it came to the spread of disease. The government should listen to her words: \u201cTo be \u2018in charge\u2019 is certainly not only to carry out the proper measures yourself, but to see that everyone else does too.\u201d Marika McGregor Corinaldo, Italy \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters \u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?
