The odds now favour that the denouement of the FedEx play-off series, $10m bonus and all, will involve the clear player of this year and an American who is on a roll. McIlroy\u2019s year will be brilliantly successful even without the FedEx addition, but he still wants it. Horschel won last weekend\u2019s BMW Championship and was runner-up during the previous tournament in highlighting how much of this sport involves momentum. And then there is the small matter of history. McIlroy and Horschel first faced off as amateurs during the 2007 Walker Cup at Royal County Down. The 18-year-old McIlroy was riled, or to directly quote him at the time \u201cpissed off\u201d, by his opponent\u2019s on-course antics and a youthful spat ensued. McIlroy, it should be noted, won the singles contest. Time has healed; McIlroy and Horschel are perfectly friendly now, but what has come before merely adds to the prospect of an intriguing East Lake Sunday. With 18 holes to play, McIlroy and Horschel are tied at nine under par in leading the Tour Championship. McIlroy must upstage his old foe in order to win the FedEx Cup. In offering a hint at how times have changed, McIlroy even cited a potential mistake by the United States captain, Tom Watson, in overlooking Horschel for a Ryder Cup pick. \u201cI\u2019m sure Tom Watson is kicking himself right now. Billy is playing great. But that\u2019s another story,\u201d McIlroy said. McIlroy\u2019s Saturday had lacked spark, particularly on the greens, before a wonderfully holed 27ft putt for eagle on the 15th. He was to return a 67, due in no small part to a glorious recovery shot from clawing rough behind the 18th green. \u201cI guess when you look at the score, 67, is good in the circumstances, but it really wasn\u2019t much to look at,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played my best golf by any stretch this week but I\u2019m just sort of grinding out scores and trying to keep myself at the top of the leaderboard.\u201d Horschel fared two shots worse but of course had started from a stronger position. His form is even more admirable given the small matter of his wife being due to give birth within the next fortnight. \u201cI\u2019m loving it, I really am loving it,\u201d Horschel said. \u201cI wish we could tee it up right now and play tomorrow\u2019s round.\u201d It would, nonetheless, be short-sighted to view Sunday on the outskirts of Atlanta as automatically a two-horse race. A string of fine fillies are in close pursuit of the leading duo; Jim Furyk, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose and Jason Day among them. Furyk was blunt when asked if he knows what he has to do on Sunday to secure the overall FedEx prize. \u201cI don\u2019t really care,\u201d said the man who will represent the United States in a Ryder Cup for a ninth time later this month. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask. If you\u2019d like to tell me \u2013 because it looks like you\u2019re dying to \u2013 you\u2019re more than welcome but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not going to affect anything about the golf tournament tomorrow.\u201d Point taken, Jim. After his third-round 66, a more expansive Rose paid tribute to both his own work on the greens and Horschel\u2019s focus. \u201cBilly has got a lot on his mind,\u201d Rose said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of emotions at home and on the golf course, and obviously it\u2019s working for him right now. \u201cI just missed a ton of short putts in round one. I think I missed probably five putts that you should brush in pretty simply. So when you give away that many, it adds up on the scorecard. \u201cThe last couple of days have been much cleaner around the hole and just taking my chances when they come. That\u2019s been about it really. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d In typifying the occasionally hard-to- fathom nature of the FedEx points system, should Fowler win the Tour Championship and McIlroy finish second on his own, a playoff for the overall prize would ensue. \u201cI know most of the scenarios for me,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI know if I win here, I have got a pretty good chance. I know there\u2019s some possibilities of some extra-curricular activities if certain things line up properly.\u201d One presumes, or hopes, Fowler meant that sudden-death scenario. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to tomorrow,\u201d he added. \u201cObviously all I can do is go play the best I can, make sure I commit to every shot, get the best out of the round that I can, not leave anything out there and see where that puts us after 18 holes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
