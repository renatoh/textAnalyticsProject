The Manchester City striker, the Premier League\u2019s leading scorer with 25 goals, has revamped his fitness regime to try to avoid the muscle injuries that plagued him in recent seasons. The 26-year-old\u2019s hat-trick in Sunday\u2019s 6-0 hammering of Queens Park Rangers took him five clear of Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane in league goals and to 31 in all competitions, the Argentinian\u2019s best ever return. This has been possible despite the knee injury that ruled him out from 6 December to 10 January. He said: \u201cI had to change a lot of things, starting with my food. I needed a healthier way of life. Touch wood, I haven\u2019t had any muscle injuries this season, only the knee problem. In training sessions I was struggling a little bit last season. For example, after every three training sessions I had to stop \u2013 so I have improved in that. I have also had to have a lot of treatment after training sessions as well. Now I hope I can stay like this until the end of my career.\u201d Ag\u00fcero has cut out what were formerly dietary staples. \u201cI went to a doctor in Italy and he checked everything we did; and I had to change quite a bit \u2013 no more pasta, no more sugar and no meat, which I used to eat quite a bit because Argentinian meat is very good,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this season has proved that it has worked and I can stay the same until the end of my career.\u201d Of the 31 goals this season Ag\u00fcero said: \u201cEvery season is different. I hope I can keep scoring like this but defenders now know me a bit better and defend against me in different ways. My job is to score goals but what I really want next season is for City to win titles. The hat-trick was important but the best thing for me was that the team won and that we are getting closer to Champions League football next season. \u201cI started the season very well but then got injured and, after I came back, with the more minutes I played I got better and better. I try to do that every season. I am here to score goals and play as many games as possible.\u201d Ag\u00fcero was not recognised by his peers, failing to be voted into the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association team of the year or receive a nomination for the player of the year award. \u201cIt also happened in the season when I scored 23 goals and we won the Premier League and I didn\u2019t get the Young Player of the Season award,\u201d he said of the 2011-12 campaign when Tottenham\u2019s Kyle Walker received the accolade. \u201cSo my job is just to keep working as hard as I can and keep scoring goals. I expect to do the same again next season.\u201d Ag\u00fcero has praise for David Silva, whose goal against QPR was his 12th for the club this season. \u201cDavid is a top player. The press always highlight the assists that he gets but he has also scored a lot of goals this season,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone in the world would like to play with David and we should be thankful he is playing with us here at City. I just love to play with him.\u201d Ag\u00fcero is clear that, with City failing to defend the title, the club are determined to challenge again next year. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won this time but our objective every year is to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we will be celebrating something by the end of next season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
