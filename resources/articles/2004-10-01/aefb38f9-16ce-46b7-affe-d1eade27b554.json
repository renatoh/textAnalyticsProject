That would trigger a leadership contest under the Labour party's complex rules. All candidates for the post need the nomination of 12.5% of Labour MPs. Since Labour currently has 407 MPs, candidates would need just over 50 MPs on their side, although this total is almost certain to drop after the next election. Once the candidates are agreed, voting takes place in three sections: MPs and MEPs; individual party members; and members of affiliated organisations such as trade unions, the Fabian Society and the Cooperative party. Each section represents one third of the total vote. The process can take time. In 1994 more than two months passed between John Smith's death and Tony Blair's election. Tony Blair - like Margaret Thatcher in 1990 and John Major in 1995 - would remain prime minister while the party made up its mind. Whoever won would be under pressure to call a snap election by the summer. 2 A place in history How does the prime minister want to be remembered? If he left before the next election Iraq would probably dominate the assessment. By staying on well into the third term, but not to its end, Mr Blair might be able recover his reputation as a radical and successful leader without driving leadership candidates to distraction. His legacy could include the crushing of the Conservatives, a third record Labour term in power, public recognition of the benefits flowing from Labour's increase in public sector spending and reform or a successful referendum on the European constitution and currency. Any of these things could polish up his currently tarnished reputation well before 2009 yet allow him to leave office much sooner than he suggested yesterday. 3 Mid-term blues If the third term could go right, it could also go wrong. By raising the issue of his political shelf life, the prime minister has opened up a legitimate discussion about a successor. Poor mid-term elections, a fallout between cabinet colleagues, a worsening situation in Iraq or even a revived opposition from the Lib Dems or Tories could bring a return of the wobble which supposedly almost brought his resignation earlier this year. The prime minister would then quit and leave his party to fight it out. 4 The coup Years of Tory crisis have made the idea of ousting leaders less outrageous than it once was. But a repeat of Margaret Thatcher's downfall is hard to achieve under Labour rules. If the Labour party leader refuses to resign, he or she faces a leadership election when one is requested by a majority of the party conference on a card vote, that is when delegates at conference vote according to the number of Labour-affiliated members they represent. Labour could call a special conference to hold the party vote. But this can only be called if voted for by a majority of Labour's national executive committee. Assuming a conference vote ousts the leader, normal election rules apply. Tony Blair would remain in office while a contest took place - a bloodbath that might take two months. Mr Blair could be asked to go by cabinet allies if he is judged a liability, large-scale backbench revolts could leave him neutered or an embittered Mr Brown might quit to fight from the backbenches. 5 Election backlash By gambling that voters are willing to keep him in office with a working majority until 2009, Tony Blair has staked a lot on the next general election. If Labour does badly - perhaps at the hands of the Lib Dems - calls for a swift handover to a new prime minister will grow within the party, especially if voters are seen to have shied away from supporting a party whose leader's future is uncertain. Mr Blair could be destabilised before his third term gets under way. There are even darker scenarios. A Tory victory looks all but mathematically impossible but a hung parliament is not. Would smaller parties be prepared to prop up Mr Blair as he heads towards retirement?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
