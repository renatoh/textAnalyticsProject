West Ham was among three clubs to have signed commercial partnerships with Incite. The Aim-listed firm provides subscribers to its mobile phone text service with exclusive updates on club news. Announcing the West Ham deal in September 2003, Incite managing director Simon Hellier, who owns a 22.5% stake in the company, said: \"Supporters deserve to be part of the club in hearing the latest news first.\" Last month, however, West Ham terminated its links with the Incite service, known as hammers(((on!))). In court documents, the club claims minimum guaranteed payments had not been met by Incite. On its website, West Ham recommended \"supporters who subscribe to the service immediately stop paying their monthly subscription as Incite no longer have the ability or authority to provide the service\". In response, Incite, which charges subscribers \u00a37.50 a month, sent out a hammers(((on!))) text claiming the service had become unofficial, and now provided news \"uncensored\" by the club. Incite text updates now largely consists of information widely available, free of charge, from other sources. West Ham went on to file a claim for missing payments and damages at the high court and has won a judgment in its favour after Incite failed to put forward a defence. The size of the claim has not been disclosed. Tottenham Hotspur is now the only club signed up to an exclusive agreement with Incite. In September the stock exchange found Incite had breached Aim rules by failing to inform investors of \"a change in the performance of its business\". It found the business lacked revenue and working capital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
