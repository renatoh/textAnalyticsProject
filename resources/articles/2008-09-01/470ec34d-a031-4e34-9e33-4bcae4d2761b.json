Plaudits have been rolling in for Elena Miro's show which opened Milan fashion week on Saturday. The \"garden party\" designs using plus-size models went down a treat, though it seems likely to remain a talking point rather than a precedent, alas. Rather strangely, the Australian seems to think it set the tone for Milan as the fashion week of \"common sense\" with clothes for \"sensible company\". Not sure exactly what company they are thinking of but it's clearly a rich one which we would like to hang out in - there's not much on the catwalks of Milan that could possibly be described as affordable. Miro's designs - themselves hardly budget buys - can be found by UK consumers at Beige Plus (just don't blame us for the terrible name). In vogue Fashion's top editors - or editrices as Grazia will persist in calling them - are all, naturally, gathered in Milan. The collective fashion clout of Vogue (enough, surely, to fell an elephant at 100 paces) was on display at the \"Russia: 10 years in Vogue\" party. The editor of Russian Vogue, Aliona Doletskaya, is one of many names whispered whenever the possibility of Anna Wintour's eventual successor at US Vogue is discussed. Personally we feel on that dark day, Vogue should be turned into a tennis fanzine in tribute, but there's just no justice in the world. Anyway Doletskaya would surely be the only fashion magazine editor with a Ph.D. in comparative linguistics. Maybe she can stop Grazia from using editrix? Trendsetter What Miuccia Prada decides will be in fashion usually obeys her every dictat - so come spring next year we will all, apparently, be pining for \"primitivism and the clothes that women primitively want - bras and panties, gold and animal skin\". But what are we to make of this? \"The idea was to move away from all the fussy, couture-derived fashion that I think has become too heavy and overexploited.\" Errr ... you mean like last season's Prada show? Still, the Prada catwalk was full of lace in Feburary, and lo and behold, so are the high street stores. Thus, it shall come to pass that we all spend summer in leopardskin bras. Don't you know who I am? Milan's traffic is notoriously bad and no one is exempt - Barbara Berlusconi, daughter of Silvio, held up the Blumarine show and then only made it at the very end. Couldn't she have borrowed one of daddy's helicopters? Milan goes preppy US retailer to honed-torsos and skinny legged girls, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, are opening a flagship store in Milan early next year. If it's anything like the one on Fifth Avenue in New York there will be half-naked male models posed permanently at the doors and music so loud your eardrums will bleed by the time you've found a T-shirt in the cavernous pitch-black depths of the store. Something for Milan to look forward to. Out in the cold Of course, not every fashionista in Milan gets to sit in the front row. Or even get into the shows. Italian fashion labels, apparently, aren't entirely with the times when it comes to this newfangled technology - things like \"blogs\" and \"the internet\" you know. One blogger voiced their frustration online: I'm sure you all know by now we don't get invitations for anything since we're supposedly the next fashion generation. We might get some when we're a bit older and our arms look like this. But now, with hard and nice muscles we don't get sh*t, so, obviously, we have to crash. Now now, there's no need to take it out on La Wintour. I'm sure the Italian fashion press will prove us all wrong by reading modamilanesa and this very fashion diary and awarding us all front row seats. Hello? Anyone? Oh. Meanwhile, back in the UK... Good enough to eat News reaches our ears that Jo Malone will shortly be unveiling a new perfume - a sweet lime and cedar cologne inspired by the scents and flavours of Thai cooking. Now, we have to confess that being a cynical grumpy old fashion diary we used to resist the lure of Jo Malone entirely on the basis that everyone else loved it. I know, we're contrary that way. Then a citrus-scented revelation came over us and now we can't get enough of the grapefruit and lime basil with mandarin varieties. So more beautiful scents that smell good enough to eat win an enthusiastic thumbs in the air from us. And finally No, we have no Trevor Macdonald-style cute pet stories to offer you, but instead a very odd interview - if you haven't already read Camilla Long's interview with Elle Macpherson in the Times, do. Sample quote: She makes me feel anxious, so I ask her if she is happy. \"I don't believe . . . I find it really difficult because 'happy' comes from ego space: 'Is your ego getting its way right now?',\" she says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
