Instead, Trump has planned a competing event, described as a benefit for military veterans. \u201cThe \u2018debate\u2019 tonight will be a total disaster\u2026\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI hate to see this.\u201d Hates it! Will Trump pay for turning his back on Fox, the conservative media powerhouse? Or do they need him more than he needs them? Up to now, his every offense has boosted him in polls.

In a nod to the surprising strength of the Sanders campaign, the Hillary Clinton camp came out behind the idea of extending the Democratic debate calendar through late spring. We have always been willing to add additional debates beyond the six that had been scheduled,\u201d the Clinton campaign said in a statement. They look forward to it! The Vermont senator announced he would co-sponsor legislation to repeal protections for gun manufacturers and dealers \u2013 protections he voted for in 2005. Clinton has been hitting Sanders hard on the issue. And the Brady campaign, the prominent gun safety group backing Clinton, was skeptical: \u201cForgive us for not buying it.\u201d As the senator\u2019s numbers fell in Iowa, a survey found that only 32% of Iowa Republicans think someone born outside the United States could be president.
