On the pitch, PES still shines. The players feel weighty and under your control, the ball pings about as you'd expect and the games are fast and fluid. Compared to the glacial pace of Fifa, this speed is welcome. The improvements in AI are noticeable, while the graphical depictions of the top players - both face and body - are impressive. But off the pitch, things go wrong. Online play is a laggy mess, and there is still no sign of the co-op play you would expect to see in 2007. Juddery replays and occasional slowdowns are further niggles, and the product as a whole feels rushed and unfinished. For most games this would be too much, but PES still plays the best videogame football around. Just don't expect a revolution. Greg Howson Project Gotham Racing 4 Xbox 360, \u00a339.99, cert 3+, Bizarre Creations/Microsoft, 5 stars As with Halo 3, the latest version of the popular arcade-style racer pursues a policy of evolution rather than radical change. Most noticeable is the presence of motorbikes for the first time, and the single-player experience has been split into Arcade and Career modes. The latter takes the form of a racing season, in which you compete in groups to improve your world ranking. So, on circuits set on the streets of cities of Europe, Asia and North America, you take part in eliminators, Kudos challenges (gathering points by hanging out the tail and so on) and more of those infamous cones that you have to drive around. Car or bike choice is critical in career mode, which sometimes annoys, as you can still find yourself negotiating cones in a Ferrari Enzo, say - which seems like sacrilege, particularly given that Bizarre Creations has overegged the weather effects and you invariably have to drive in the rain. Bike handling seems rather dumbed-down, too. But fantastic graphics, super-exotic virtual machinery, a meaty arcade mode and superb online support overcome those gripes with ease. Steve Boxer Half Life 2: The Orange Box PC, \u00a334.99, cert 16+, Valve, 5/5 Half Life 2 may have been quiet for a while, but the Orange Box reminds us why it remains the connoisseur's FPS. What you get are five full games - two old (HL2 and the smallish HL: Ep1) plus the brand new Ep2, Team Fortress 2 and Portal. Ep2 is the star for HL fans, taking the player outside the Orwellian City 17 for the first time. Team Fortress shows the older multiplayer master looking good after nearly a decade, while Portal presents the kind of intriguing new puzzler you'd expect from Nintendo. You could justify the price for any two of these games, let alone all five - it's Christmas in a little orange box.
