In cold, wet conditions Quins had to work hard, but they showed more invention than the visitors and deservedly took the points. Harlequins found themselves under pressure early in the game and were probably thankful to concede only a penalty to Danny Tickle. The heavy conditions meant there was little in the way of expansive rugby but Hull, with strong drives from the forwards and some astute kicking from Chris Thorman asked questions of the home defence. But that defence was pretty strong and when Quins were able to move upfield they opened their account with a fine try. Strong running from the forwards took them to within 20 metres of the visitors' line and, after the fifth tackle, the Hull defenders were probably expecting a grubber kick to the in-goal area. However, hooker Chad Randall fooled everybody by taking the ball right and finding Tony Clubb with a long pass. The young centre showed all his power and a bit of pace to make it to the line despite the efforts of several defenders. Danny Orr made it 6-2 with the conversion but from the restart the home side found themselves in trouble. A knock-on at a play-the-ball gave Hull a good attacking position and backchat to the referee turned it into a penalty. Quins then gave away another through ball-stealing and it was inevitable that their defensive line would be broken. A long ball from Thorman found Kirk Yeaman in space on the left and the centre ran in for an easy touchdown. Hull continued to look dangerous and kept Harlequins pinned deep inside their own half through clever tactical kicks from Thorman and Richard Horne. However, the home defence remained resolute. Harlequins took the lead three minutes into the second half when a clever kick by Luke Dorn forced a goal-line drop-out. Quins took play to the Hull line and the ever alert Randall slipped a pass out from dummy-half to the charging Jason Golden who scored by the posts. Orr made no mistake with the conversion but Hull were back on level terms within six minutes. A knock-on gave them a good attacking position and on the fifth tackle Thorman put in a neat grubber kick to the line. Wells could not secure the bouncing ball and Craig Hall stepped in to touchdown. Tickle again drew them level with the conversion and Orr broke the deadlock with a penalty midway through the half. Quins then took control, a 40-20 kick from Randall giving them a good attacking platform and three tackles later a flat pass from the hooker found David Howell on the charge. The centre blasted over and Orr's conversion gave them an eight-point cushion. Suddenly Hull were chasing the game and forced to be more expansive but they could not penetrate a tough defence and Orr landed a second penalty five minutes from time to secure victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
