They also form the backbone of the Fifty Cents for Your Soul film season, which explores the representation of women's mental health since the golden age of Hollywood as part of the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival. The festival aims not only to challenge perceptions of mental health, but to stimulate debate and collaboration between the arts and mental health professionals. Lee Knifton, the festival director, says: \"The starting point for this was to look at addressing stigma towards mental health problems with the public as a whole.\" When he first considered staging an arts festival, the remit was small-scale and limited in its locale; a weekend of films shown in and around Glasgow. Three years on, it has grown into the world's largest such festival with more than 200 events up and down the country, from music and dance to film, comedy and theatre. The festival's reach now also extends beyond its three-week programme, with a series of year-round projects inspired by work and collaborations started during its run. In addition to gender and mental health, organisers have looked at themes such as community cohesion and mental health and the recession and wellbeing. The festival also features dance, music and comedy. Comedian Phil Kay, playwright Liz Lochhead, and authors Denise Mina and Louise Welsh are among the headline acts. The closing concert, Music Like a Vitamin at the Edinburgh Playhouse, has been curated by Rod Jones, guitarist and vocalist with the band Idlewild, who has had depression. \"The whole point to me is not just to make people aware of what services are available for them but also to make them realise that they are not alone and it is a common thing to happen,\" says Jones. Jones, who became involved in the festival last year, has not been surprised by its rapid expansion and broader impact. \"One of the great things that has come from it is the year-round projects that have helped people on a day-to-day basis. There are certain projects and workshops set up because of the festival, projects that keep people involved in this issue because depression, for example, does not go away because of one good month,\" he says. \"In just one area, the arts can provide a hub or focus for so much,\" adds Knifton. \"The festival can provide a meaningful and empowering platform for some people who have experience of mental ill health to change the way people think, and to have positive identities as high-calibre artists.\" The Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival continues until 22 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
