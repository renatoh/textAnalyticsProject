In April of that year, he went to New York's first integrated club, Cafe Society in Greenwich Village, and was introduced to the cult venue's star turn, a young Billie Holiday. Meeropol sang Holiday his song and gave her the lyrics; a week later she ended her set with it, leaving her audience stunned. The jazz world is suspicious of Strange Fruit. It hasn't really become a jazz standard and has probably been covered by more pop stars (Robert Wyatt, the Gun Club, Jeff Buckley \u2026) than jazz musicians. But it remains a key moment in jazz history, not least because it explicitly addressed the civil rights struggle that black jazz musicians had implicitly been a part of. Sonically, Holiday \u2013 who had learned her craft in the bands of Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson \u2013 puts in a performance that exploits fully the dynamic potential of the recently developed microphone, something that would become increasingly important for any jazz singer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
