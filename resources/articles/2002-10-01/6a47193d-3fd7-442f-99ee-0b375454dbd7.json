The First Division club are today hoping to get approval from the Football League to move to the Milton Keynes Bowl, but Gjelsten admitted yesterday that he is becoming fed up with their problems. \"Wimbledon has been a burden, not in the least economically,\" he said. \"Bankruptcy is, tragically enough, an alternative. We have also considered selling the club for a symbolic sum, if anyone expresses an interest.\" Gjelsten bought Wimbledon with Kjell Inge Roekke in 1997 and revealed that they have lost \u00a343m since then, during which time the club have also lost their Premiership place. He cited problems with Merton Council involving proposals to build a stadium in the borough, while the plan to move to Milton Keynes has provoked death threats. \"We have waited and waited for the authorities in the neighbourhood to give the clear signal for a plan for such a stadium, but it never happened,\" Gjelsten added. \"It took a long time before we realised that the local politicians didn't want a new big stadium. At some point, one concludes that enough is enough.\" The Football League's board will meet today to consider whether or not to grant Wimbledon a licence to move to the MK bowl. The club have only recently made a formal proposal to stage games at the site, which will be reviewed on practicality grounds. \"There has been an application from Wimbledon and this will be discussed,\" said John Nagle, a Football League spokesman. \"The league opposes the idea of franchising and was not in favour of the move. The club have outline permission to move to Milton Keynes and we agreed to a binding decision.\" The League is bound to approve the move to Buckinghamshire, providing it meets its requirements. Martin Hinshelwood, the sacked Brighton manager, is still mulling over the club's offer of to become director of football. He was replaced by Steve Coppell on Monday after a run that saw the team lose their last 10 league games. \"I'm thinking things over at the minute,\" Hinshelwood said. \"Nothing's ruled out and nothing's ruled in. But I'd like to wish Steve all the best and I sincerely hope that things work out for him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
