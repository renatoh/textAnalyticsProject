The 12 portraits, commissioned by the Prince of Wales, include the artist Jonathan Yeo\u2019s portrait of Geoffrey Pattinson, who was only 20 in 1944 when, as a sergeant in the 9th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, he left twice to join the invasion. The glider he was supposed to land in Normandy was faulty, but he succeeded in getting back to land safely in Hampshire. By the evening of D-day he had rejoined his platoon, crossed the Channel and was back with his unit. The invasion of German-occupied France involved 7,700 ships and 12,000 aircraft. Pattinson is among several glider pilots and passengers to be portrayed, including Patrick Turner, a private with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, whose glider landed within 50 metres of Pegasus bridge before he joined in the successful attack on the position. The artists in the exhibition, which opens on Saturday, include several former winners of the BP Portrait prize: Stuart Pearson Wright, Ishbel Myerscough, James Lloyd and Catherine Goodman, who is also artistic director of the Royal Drawing School and curator of The Last of the Tide. The exhibition is at the Queen\u2019s Gallery, which usually charges an entrance fee, but admission to see the portraits will be free. Prince Charles said: \u201cIt seemed to me a tragedy that there were no portraits of D-day veterans, hence this collection of remarkable old soldiers from the regiments of which my wife and I are Colonel or Colonel-in-Chief.\u201d The Last of the Tide, Queen\u2019s gallery, Buckingham Palace, 6-17 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
