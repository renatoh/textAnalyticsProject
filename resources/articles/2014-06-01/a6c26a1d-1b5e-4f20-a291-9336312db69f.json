Things start alarmingly as breezy Hannah Arterton is asked by a customs officer for the purpose of her visit. \"Hol-i-day-ee!\" she chirrups in Madonna-esque reply, setting the tone for what is to come. The dialogue is terrible (\"There we were on the beach, covered in tomatoes, and I just\u2026 knew!\"), the acting variable, and the mouths either fixed in cracked smiles or wide-open astonishment (Greg Wise's perma-guppy lingers). But StreetDance directors Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini make sure the whole thing goes off like a fizzy-pop hen night, and you may find yourself tickled, providing your toes don't curl up so far that they actually stab you in the heart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
