Mr Murphy said Liquid News had \"brought smiles of pain and amusement to those either side of the celebrity divide\", but was now being decommissioned because \"tough decisions\" had to be made to make sure BBC3 \"constantly refreshes its output\". He added Liquid News presenters Paddy O'Connell - who also fronts BBC3 show Celebdaq - and Claudia Winkleman would continue to work for the channel on other projects. \"I'm really proud of what Liquid News has achieved in the four years it has been on air. During that time it had passion and irreverence for celebrity in equal measure,\" Mr Murphy said. \"However, BBC3 is a constantly evolving channel and tough decisions have to be made to ensure it refreshes its output to better serve the audience,\" he added. \"I'm delighted that Paddy O'Connell and Claudia Winkleman will be continuing to work on new projects on BBC3, which are currently being developed and will be announced in the near future.\" Liquid News, which began life as Zero30 four years ago on BBC News 24 before switching to BBC3's predecessor, BBC Choice, in May 2000, became cult viewing under its acerbic first presenter, Christopher Price. The programme never enjoyed large audiences, but tapped into the public's increasing fascination with celebrity and showbusiness and came at the subject in a refreshingly witty and irreverent style, in a similar fashion to Heat magazine. Price's sudden death in April last year, aged 34, shocked the TV industry. Following Price's death, Liquid News was revamped and O'Connell and Winkleman took over as the main presenters, with Heat editor Mark Frith hosting the show on Fridays. Winkelman is considered one of the BBC's rising stars after a successful stint on Fame Academy's spin-off show on BBC3. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
