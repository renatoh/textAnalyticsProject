Seven men from the Party for Freedom group waved placards and flags, shouted \u201cAussie pride, nationwide\u201d, \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cdisgrace\u201d through megaphones after they crashed the City of Yarra council meeting in Richmond at about 7pm on Tuesday. \u201cThe ones who should call Australia home are Australians,\u201d one protester shouted. Mayor Amanda Stone said: \u201cIt was disruptive and it was disappointing ... eventually they left after a few minutes and one even apologised for disrupting the meeting,\u201d Stone said. Police were called and stayed at the hall for some time after the disruption but no arrests were made. Last month, the federal government stripped Yarra council of the power to hold citizenship ceremonies after it voted unanimously to stop referring to 26 January as Australia Day and end its tradition of holding citizenship ceremonies on that date in recognition of it being a day of distress for many Indigenous people. At the time, Stone said: \u201cPeople can still have their barbecues and parties on the January 26 public holiday but I hope our stance encourages people to stop and think about what this date really means in the history of our nation.\u201d After the move, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said: \u201cAn attack on Australia Day is a repudiation of the values the day celebrates: freedom, a fair go, mateship and diversity.\u201d Days later, Darebin council followed suit and voted to move its citizenship ceremonies to another date. The deputy mayor, Gaetano Greco, said: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to have a party on a day where it basically was a day of invasion and Australia\u2019s brutal colonisation,\u201d he said. \u201cNew migrants who become aware of January 26 will not want to become an Australian citizen on that particular day.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
