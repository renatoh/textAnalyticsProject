But my message to everyone at Arsenal would be to stay calm because we can improve.\u201d Emery is not blind to his team\u2019s faults, however, and recognised that though Arsenal competed well enough when the scores were level, they fell away alarmingly once Leicester took the lead. \u201cWhen they scored the first goal maybe that was the moment we lost the possibility to do anything in the game,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBefore that our attitude had been good and I was pleased with the way we stuck to the gameplan we worked out. \u201cWe had our moments, but so did Leicester and they scored from theirs. We need some more passion in our game, we need to restore some confidence, but we were playing a very good side. There is still a long way to go in the season and, though it is true that Leicester and Chelsea are pulling away from us, we are still above Manchester United and Tottenham in the table.\u201d Whether that will satisfy Emery\u2019s critics is debatable, though everyone at Arsenal will agree with what the manager thinks should happen next. \u201cThe first thing we need to do is get stronger at home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to feel confident about winning at home, just like Leicester do. The reason we lost this game was because Leicester are in a good moment but also because they are always confident and strong when they play at home.\u201d Brendan Rodgers was not about to disagree with that. \u201cAll round it was a very good win,\u201d the Leicester manager said. \u201cOnce we scored the first goal we took control of the game. I think it was a compliment to us that Arsenal reverted to a back five; I think the last time we saw them do that was in the Europa League final against Chelsea. Arsenal can hurt you on the counterattack but we managed the game very well. We attacked with confidence and showed steel in defence.\u201d Jamie Vardy scored the all-important first goal and Rodgers paid tribute to his striker\u2019s ability and work rate. \u201cObviously I saw him a lot before I came to this club, and I\u2019ve always been impressed with his positioning and efficiency,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the area where he will get opportunities and due to the economy of his game he always has the energy to put themaway.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
