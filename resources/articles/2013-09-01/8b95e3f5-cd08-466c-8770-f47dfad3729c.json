They shook hands at the end, of course, and there was no apparent rancour during the 87 minutes the contest lasted, but nor was there any disguising the mix of relief and delight on the champion's face when she beat Sloane Stephens in straight sets on Sunday. Their rivalry, and allegedly patched-up Twitter-feud, is carved in the stone of tennis history and one day they will be allowed to put all that behind them. But for now Williams loves nothing more than a good fight and she won this one 6-4, 6-1 as if it were the final. That is where she looks destined to arrive again on the final weekend to defend her title and reach for a fifth. For now the world No1 is in the quarter-finals against the 18th seed, Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, who defeated the eighth seed, Angela Kerber, 6-4, 6-1. While the wild card Tim Smyczek was battling Marcel Granollers in the men's draw, hoping to avoid an American-free quarter-final stage for the first time in the tournament's history, the greater focus of the fans was trained on Williams v Stephens. They shone in shades of blinding pink, their shoes lighting up the court too. This was as much a fashion war as a tennis match. Their forehands flashed like pistols in a duel, the younger player eerily mirroring the older, as she rose on her toes and thrashed her shoulder muscles through the shot to spread confusion on the other side of the net. It was not quite Tennis Past playing Tennis Future, because Serena has a lot of life in her yet, as she showed when she came through a searching examination, then finished with a regal flourish in the second set. \"It's an honour to be able to play on the court with one of the greatest tennis players of all time,\" Stephens said later, adding that she did not balk at the prospect of leading the next American generation. \"Next year there could be three other American girls in the top 20. Right now I'm carrying the little torch but I'm OK with it. I embrace it. The second set got away from me a little bit. All in all, I thought I competed well and played well. That's all you can do, really.\" On Monday the only other American left in the women's draw, Alison Riske, plays Daniela Hantuchova."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
