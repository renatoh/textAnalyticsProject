However, tomorrow we should get some kind of update on the takeover approach made by the company's oligarch founders and the Kazakh government: the consortium will have to either stick or twist with its indicative \u00a33bn offer, or ask regulators for an extension. Those hired to speak for ENRC's independent committee assessing the approach insist it is doing everything possible to extract a higher bid for minority shareholders (although they are too shy to explain exactly what those efforts entail). Meanwhile, those close to FTSE 250 miner Kazakhmys, which owns 26% of ENRC, insist that reports it has already fallen in behind its compatriots are premature. The trouble is, many have heard such platitudes before and the market seems disinclined to believe them. ENRC shares, once worth \u00a314.59 each, stand at 239.9p, 5% below the 260p-a-share offer. The City may be wrong, but it seems to be betting on a deadline extension and then for minority shareholders to get stuffed. Again. King heads for the pavilion Sir Mervyn King, the soon-to-be-former governor of the Bank of England, is a man who loves a sporting metaphor. So as the Bank's monetary policy committee reveals the decision from its June deliberations over interest rates and quantitative easing this week, which is King's last meeting, it is tempting to consider the spectacle as akin to the fifth Test from pretty much any England versus West Indies cricket series in the 1980s. We've all got to sit through it, and there may even be the odd enjoyable contribution, but it is totally meaningless in terms of the overall result. Firstly, it would seem odd for a radical change of tactics just before Mark Carney, Threadneedle Street's new Canadian skipper, strides to the crease next month. Second, in the absence of any negative economic news since May's gathering, economists reckon the discussion will mirror recent months. That debate has seen King outvoted on the past four occasions about introducing more QE to stimulate the UK economy, so this week's meeting provides his team with a final chance to ignore him. And for King to play and miss one more time. And so does Buckles Here is Nick Buckles, the former boss of accident-prone security group G4S, speaking about his aborted takeover tilt at rival ISS following the company's humbling annual general meeting last year: \"[Shareholders] didn't like the deal \u2026 These things take a little bit of time to heal. We're 70%-80% of the way there.\" As was common with Buckles, the confidence merely pre-empted farce. A month later the healing process was reversed, as G4S messed up the Olympic Games contract and the armed forces were mobilised at short notice to come to the rescue. A profit warning earlier this year made it a hat-trick, and Buckles inevitably left the group on Friday. The company now hopes his departure will allow the slapstick to be considered part of history, as the board faces shareholders once again this week to present its (very) fresh line-up. The new chief exec, Ashley Almanza, has been with the group for just a month, while incoming chief operating officer Eddie Aston has yet to arrive. That makes it appear as though new(ish) chairman John Connolly has been forced into a brutal conclusion: when it comes to healing shareholder wounds, people with zero experience of running this complex firm are preferable to the last lot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
