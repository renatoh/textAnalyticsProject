Her efforts\u201a which included digging a trench for mains water, installing central heating and putting in a new bathroom, helped boost the value of the small Georgian end-of-terrace in Stockwell, south London, from almost nothing in 1980 to around \u00a3700,000. In fact, Tschepp has added so much value that the local council, Lambeth, wants to sell her home at auction. \"When you've worked so hard on a place, you know each part of it,\" says Tschepp, a 56-year-old community education worker. \"You know how the building works. It's a weird thing to say, but you're almost intimate with it. I've put so much into this house and I just find it heartbreaking the council think they can just say 'clear off, it's ours; we're having it back'.\" Tschepp is among the few dozen people left in Lambeth's so-called \"shortlife\" properties \u2013 homes handed over to housing co-operatives in the late 1970s and early 1980s when they were uncoveted, ramshackle and mainly marked for demolition. But plans changed and the tenancies stretched from years to decades, with an implicit understanding that tenants were in these properties permanently. Then came twin catalysts: Lambeth found itself short of funds and London experienced a property boom that made the homes hugely valuable. It was 2009 when Lambeth announced it would auction the shortlife portfolio, arguing this would raise about \u00a350m to spend on more efficient housing priorities. Critics, among them the local Labour MP Kate Hoey, call the selloff unjust and argue that it takes no account of the tenants' role in preserving and improving these newly valuable assets. She says it is a betrayal of the community-led values Lambeth now claims to embody as the \"co-operative council\". There have, undoubtedly, been cases which appear insensitive. Jimmy Rogers, 74, spent decades running a community basketball team in Brixton. A few years after honouring Rogers for his efforts, Lambeth started pursuing him for his tiny terraced home. He too faces imminent eviction. Another man saw his home of three decades seized by bailiffs just 20 minutes after he lost a court case. When he returned to fetch his possessions, he had to jostle through prospective auction purchasers inspecting the house. Tschepp was among those on Lambeth's housing waiting list who volunteered to take on a shortlife property as part of a co-operative. \"With a lot of the people who were vulnerable, their vulnerability was absorbed into the co-op. They didn't need to call on social services,\" she says. \"We looked after each other. If you hadn't seen someone for a few days, you'd go and visit them.\" During much of this period, about two miles away in Clapham, John and Karina Blackhurst were patching up a much larger, equally dilapidated Georgian house shared with other families. Life was hard. They only installed central heating after 10 years, salvaging radiators from skips. The couple and their two children were left alone so long, paying rent through their co-op, that they too assumed the deal was fixed. Then they were told they must leave. In May this year, a few weeks after they moved out, the house sold at auction for \u00a32.2m. They were rehoused in a council property, but remain so upset at the experience they are unable to even walk past their former home. \"They called us a bunch of dirty squatters getting something for nothing,\" says John Blackhurst, now 56. \"But without us that house wouldn't be here now. For years we didn't hear anything from Lambeth. Suddenly we were given 28 days to leave.\" The council acknowledges it failed in letting people remain for so long in limbo. But the current Labour administration insists it has no choice but to capitalise on such valuable assets, stressing everyone is offered an alternative council home. \"Ultimately it's about priorities,\" says Pete Robbins, Lambeth's cabinet member for housing. \"I can't prioritise this small number of people over the 1,200 people in temporary accommodation, the 15,000 people on the waiting list, who also want the opportunity for an affordable home. I don't think a secure council tenancy for life is a terrible outcome.\" Robbins said he could understand the argument that the shortlife tenants had been failed by the council in the past \u2013 \"thousands of people have been failed by Lambeth over the last 20, 30 years\" \u2013 but he had to take a broader view. He says: \"I don't think they see the wider picture of housing in Lambeth, and the huge challenges we're facing. \"Ultimately, and this may sound callous, it's about asset management. You try not to prioritise one set of people over another, but the number of people you can help into decent housing at affordable levels is important.\" He concedes, however, that the shortlife money is not ringfenced for housing and cannot say what proportion of it has been spent on it. Lambeth's critics are vehement and varied, taking in the rector of Clapham and Hoey, who believes people will look back on the disposals and wonder how a Labour council acted in such a way. \"These are people who were legally given their homes under agreements with Lambeth many years ago,\" says Hoey. \"The idea that Maritza's home, with all the years of work she's put into it, will be simply sold off to the highest bidder is shocking. It's not in any way what I believe a Labour council should be doing.\" Tschepp flicks through photographs of her younger self rebuilding walls, or with her children, and says she fears the apparently inevitable. Since her notice to leave in 2009, Lambeth has refused any rent, lest it create a legal case for tenancy. The council is instead pursuing her for a backdated \"use and occupation fee\", totalling about \u00a370,000. Faced with such sums, she says, most other co-op members who wanted to remain have been pushed out. \"They're destroying lives, destroying communities, destroying the things that used to make living in Lambeth so amazing,\" she says. \"The cooperative council has to understand that you can't impose a cooperative structure on a group of people. It has to come from the people themselves and they have to be working towards a common goal. And that's what we did. We took care of vulnerable people, we nurtured them. \"Now we're just on a spreadsheet as assets to be disposed of, to be ticked off. We're not communities, we're not people: we're just in the way of them raising money.\" Additional reporting by Ben Morgan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
