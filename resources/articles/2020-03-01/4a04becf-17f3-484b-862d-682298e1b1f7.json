Emmert said in a statement Wednesday that he made the decision to conduct both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments, which begin next week, with only essential staff and limited family in attendance. The decision comes after the NCAA\u2019s Covid-19 advisory panel of medical experts recommended against playing sporting events open to the general public. Emmert said the NCAA also was looking into moving the men\u2019s Final Four from Atlanta\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium to a smaller arena. The 68-team field for the men\u2019s tournament is scheduled to be announced Sunday and the 64-team women\u2019s tournament field is to be unveiled Monday. Games begin Tuesday and Wednesday on the men\u2019s side in Dayton, Ohio, where earlier Wednesday the governor said he would issue an order to restrict spectator access to indoor sporting events. The Mid-American Conference on Tuesday announced it was closing its men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournament games at Cleveland\u2019s Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, home of the NBA\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers and scheduled site of the men\u2019s NCAA games, to the general public. The women\u2019s tournament started Wednesday. The Big West Conference announced a similar move, not allowing the general public into its basketball tournament games to be played this week at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. Conference college basketball tournaments are in full swing across the country this week. The Atlantic Coast Conference is in Day 2 of its five-day men\u2019s tournament in Greensboro, North Carolina, and the Pac-12 played the first game of its tournament in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Later Wednesday, the Southeastern Conference was to begin its men\u2019s tournament in Nahsville, Tennessee; the Big East was set to start at Madison Square Garden in New York; and the Big Ten was also scheduled to tip off in Indianapolis. There were no plans to restrict fan access to those events. March Madness hits another level next week with the start of the NCAA tournament to crown a national champion, one of the most popular events on the American sports calendar. The NCAA earned a reported $933m in revenue from last year\u2019s tournament with $800m coming from broadcast rights and the rest from ticket sales, corporate sponsorships and television advertisements. The three-week event accounts for an estimated 75% of the governing body\u2019s annual revenue, which hit $1.12bn for the fiscal year ending on 31 August 2019. There are eight first- and second-round sites for the men\u2019s tournament, scheduled to be played 19-22 March. Locations include Cleveland; Spokane, Washington; Albany, New York; Sacramento, California; and Omaha, Nebraska. The four regional sites for the second weekend of the tournament are Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Houston and New York. The Final Four is scheduled to be held in at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, with the semifinals on 4 April and the championship game 6 April. The women\u2019s tournament first- and second-round games begin 21 March and will be played at 16 sites, mostly on or close the campuses of the top seeded teams. The regionals will be played in Dallas, Greenville, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; and Fort Wayne, Indiana. The Final Four will be held in New Orleans on 3 and 5 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
