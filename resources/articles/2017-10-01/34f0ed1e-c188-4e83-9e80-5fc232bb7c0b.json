The Frenchman sustained a hamstring problem in the 3-0 win over Basel in a Champions League group game on 12 September. Since then United have beaten Everton 4-0, Burton Albion 4-1, Southampton 1-0 and CSKA Moscow 4-1 before the victory over Roy Hodgson\u2019s bottom-placed side. Along with Pogba, Mourinho is also missing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marcos Rojo and Michael Carrick, and the manager had been without Phil Jones and Marouane Fellaini for the trip to CSKA. Yet Mourinho said: \u201cWhen we moan all the time about injuries it looks like we don\u2019t trust the other people and we have to. We never miss the players that are injured, that\u2019s our way of seeing. They are injured, we don\u2019t think about them. It\u2019s an opportunity for others, is a moment for others to step up and to get the chance, so I think that\u2019s good.\u201d United\u2019s sixth win from seven league outings kept them in second place, only behind Manchester City by a goal difference of one. This is Mourinho\u2019s second season in charge of United and he has previously won the championship in the second term of all of the clubs he has managed. Yet asked if he can see similarities between United and those other title-winning teams, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s too early. Seven matches. It\u2019s too early.\u201d Juan Mata, who scored the opener against Palace, echoed Mourinho\u2019s view. \u201cWe need to try to focus on each game and not think farther,\u201d the Spaniard said. \u201cWe are happy with the start of the season, we cannot lie. And we arrive at the international break in a very good moment, scoring a lot of goals, not conceding in different competitions, so we know we have a good start but as well the manager is telling us all the time, and we know it, that it\u2019s just the beginning and we need to keep calm.\u201d While that was Mata\u2019s opening goal of the season, Fellaini took his tally to four by registering twice against Palace. Romelu Lukaku completed the scoring to make it 12 in 10 appearances since the Belgian signed for \u00a375m from Everton in the summer. In all, United have scored 21 times in the league and 32 in all competitions. Last year they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal and Mata is unsure what has changed. He said: \u201cWe are being more efficient. We are not training more on finishing than last season; it\u2019s just down to confidence. Maybe it\u2019s true that last season Zlatan was scoring almost every game and we tried to help with some goals but he was very responsible for our attack and this season everyone seems to enjoy the offensive duties. I don\u2019t know the reason. It\u2019s just \u2013 we are putting the ball in the back of the net.\u201d Of Lukaku, Mata said: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of goals, especially when you come to a new environment. I knew he would score a lot but I didn\u2019t know he would do it so quick, that\u2019s true. He gives a lot more to the team, too, but for a striker it\u2019s important to score, especially when you see other strikers are scoring. \u201cI believe that is what he feels and he\u2019s a good lad, a very humble lad and everyone likes him in the dressing room, so we are happy for him.\u201d After the international break United travel to Liverpool. Last year\u2019s corresponding fixture was a 0-0 draw but Mourinho insisted he has yet to plan for the match. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about it, I just ended this game,\u201d the 54-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about Liverpool, I can promise you that; I didn\u2019t have a second to think about the Liverpool game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
