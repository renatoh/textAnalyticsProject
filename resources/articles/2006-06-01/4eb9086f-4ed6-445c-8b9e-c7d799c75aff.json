Anne Owers, the current chief inspector of prisons, said she was concerned that the merger of five criminal justice inspectorates, including those covering the police and the courts as well as prison and probation services, would mean the \"sharp focus and direct voice of prisons' inspection will be lost or muffled.\" A cross-party revolt in the Lords next week is expected to demand that the prisons inspectorate remains separate from the new single criminal justice regulator. Parliament's influential joint human rights committee has come out strongly against abolition of the prisons inspectorate, saying it plays a crucial role in promoting a culture of respect for human rights in the prison service. MPs and peers were concerned that the prisons inspectorate inspects conditions of detention and the treatment of prisoners, while the job of the new regulator is to ensure the criminal justice system operates effectively and meets its performance targets. They also voiced concern that after a merger, the chief inspector would have to operate within government policy and be subject to direction by ministers. They said the arrangement would not be compatible with a protocol to the UN convention against torture, which came into force last week and requires each country to have an independent monitor who regularly visits places of detention. Lord Ramsbotham, former chief inspector of prisons, said the role of the merged body was \"fundamentally at odds with the purpose of inspecting prisons\", and this would put human rights at risk. Ms Owers, who was formally told yesterday that her contract will be extended until the merger, said she was only staying on after being given assurances that the robustness and methodology of custodial inspections was to be preserved. She added: \"I have consistently made clear my concern that the current structure and statutory provisions do not guarantee this for the future; and my fear that the sharp focus and direct voice of prisons inspection will be lost or muffled within a broader and differently focused body.\" Mr Reid said the extension of Ms Owers's contract would \"ensure robust business continuity in this crucial area during the transition to the proposed new inspectorate for justice, community safety and custody.\" Gerry Sutcliffe, the Home Office minister, has said he has every confidence that the new chief inspector will be as independent as the current chief inspector of prisons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
