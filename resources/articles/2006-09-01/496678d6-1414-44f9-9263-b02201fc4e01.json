Toshack initiated a debate about the historic nature of the Welsh quest with his statement: \"If we are going to qualify then we have to come to one of these strong football nations and win - not draw, win. To qualify, winning home games normally isn't good enough.\" With Germany and the Czech Republic in the group, Wales at least have the opportunity to realise an ambition but the fact that Giggs was unable to provide answer a question about Wales' achievements on foreign soil against a major country in his time - and he has been playing for them since 1992 - spoke of the degree of difficulty the Welsh have experienced on the road. Group D offers equivalent problems. Wales' one appearance beyond the group stage came in 1976 when they reached the two-leg quarter-finals. Toshack was a player then and said the catalyst for progress had been a 2-1 victory against Hungary the previous year - \"We won the group and that was the result that mattered.\" But before and since there has been no major Wales triumph abroad. The beginning of the last qualification for Euro 2004 featured a 2-0 win in Helsinki but Finland may not fit Toshack's definition of \"strong football nations.\" Slovakia, who reached the play-offs for the World Cup last November, and the Republic of Ireland are also in the group and with Wales having had England, Poland, Austria and Northern Ireland finish above them in their World Cup campaign, an improvement on fifth, never mind qualification, would be something. A solid start would help. Wales began their World Cup group with a disappointing draw in Azerbaijan and never recovered. Mark Hughes departed for Blackburn and Toshack requested then that he not be judged until this campaign. His moment has arrived, along with a squad sprinkled with youngsters and players from Leyton Orient, Gillingham and Hull City. Almost half today's expected line-up come from the Championship. Lewin Nyatanga, of Derby County, is one of them: he was 18 a fortnight ago. Robbie Savage remains in the cold. Wales will be up against a Czech side in transition and, Wales hope, with one eye on their derby in Slovakia next Wednesday. Having started the World Cup brightly against the United States, the Czechs flopped against Ghana and Italy, though they ended up with 10 men in both defeats. Since the 2-0 loss to Italy in Hamburg Pavel Nedved and Karel Poborsky have retired. Milan Baros remains injured, as do Zdenek Grygera and Vladimir Smicer, while Jan Polak is suspended. Arsenal's new signing Tomas Rosicky will playmake and Petr Cech will keep goal. Giggs was able to recall beating Cech at Old Trafford for Manchester United but scoring has been the other issue for Wales of late. John Hartson has retired and so Giggs and Craig Bellamy will try to disturb the Czechs with their pace and movement. \"It's reasonable to say that we're not as well off for goalscorers as we have been in the past,\" Toshack said. Toshack's emphasis on victory abroad does not mean he would not gladly hug a draw in Teplice, which is about 60 miles from Prague, especially with an October double-header against Cyprus and Slovakia to come. An away win tonight, though, would give Teplice a special place in the history of Welsh football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
