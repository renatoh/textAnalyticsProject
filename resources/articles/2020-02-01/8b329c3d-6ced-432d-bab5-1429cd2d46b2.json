Hyde also won sports columnist of the year, with her Guardian colleague, Jonathan Liew, collecting the silver award. Barney Ronay was also a winner at Monday\u2019s ceremony, as he was named football journalist of the year, the fifth consecutive year a Guardian writer has won the honour. Hyde\u2019s historic accolades came for her work on the Women\u2019s World Cup, Tiger Woods\u2019 redemption at the Masters, Theresa May\u2019s decision to knight Geoffrey Boycott among her regular contributions to the Guardian\u2019s sport pages. Marina Hyde was named sports writer of the year at the prestigious industry awards, the first female winner of the main prize in its 43-year history. \u201cThe winner is one of the genuine stars of our trade; perceptive, funny, sometimes brutal, always fearless,\u201d judges said. \u201cThe year of 2019 produced a steady stream of terrific sports journalism, right across the board, and the judges\u2019 task was more difficult than ever. Yet, in the end, they decided that this writer\u2019s work was truly outstanding.\u201d Judges paid tribute to Hyde for her sports columnist award: \u201cThe winning entry contained three superbly crafted columns, the writer\u2019s evisceration of Geoffrey Boycott and Theresa May epitomised a great columnist at their provocative best.\u201d Ronay, the Guardian\u2019s chief sports writer, was honoured for his reporting on, among other topics, Liverpool\u2019s comeback against Barcelona, sportswashing in European football and the racist abuse suffered by England players in Bulgaria. \u201cThis was an extremely competitive category with really not a lot between the top contenders,\u201d said the judges. \u201cThe winning journalist stands apart because of their skilful and sometimes playful writing, which can genuinely provoke a range of reactions like the game itself often can.\u201d There were also silver awards for Donald McRae (sports feature writer), David Conn (sports news reporter) and the Guardian sport website. Tumaini Carayol was nominated in the specialist correspondent category, and Suzanne Wrack was on the shortlist for best football journalist. Guardian cricket writers Ali Martin and Andy Bull won bronze awards, with Martin recognised in the sports scoop category for his report on Alex Hales\u2019 ban for recreational drug use. The Times\u2019 Mike Atherton, winner of the cricket journalist award, paid tribute to his colleague Steve James, whose daughter died unexpectedly a few weeks ago. The Daily Telegraph won sports newspaper of the year. On a hugely successful night for female journalists, the Times\u2019 Alyson Rudd was named best sports feature writer and CNN\u2019s Christina Macfarlane won broadcast journalist of the year. The Daily Mail\u2019s Laura Lambert won the sports news reporter prize and shared the sports scoop award with Matt Lawton for their work on Saracens\u2019 Premiership salary cap breaches. The central London event was hosted by Jim Rosenthal, who was presented with the Doug Gardner Award for services to sports journalism \u2013 the final award of the evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
