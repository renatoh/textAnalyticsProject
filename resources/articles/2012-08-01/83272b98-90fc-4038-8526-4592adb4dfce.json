This is not entirely his fault. He has sought to dampen the flames of expectation. No doubt he will do so again when he speaks next month to the 1922 Tory backbench committee. Boris's subject for the evening: winning elections. But the rumours will persist, and the credibility of his denial is dented when he has a day such as Wednesday. In the morning, questioned on ITV's Daybreak, he said: \"How can I issue a denial strong enough to stop this silly, silly, silly season story?\" He added: \"I'm mayor of London. I think it's inconceivable I'm going to be prime minister, and at the moment I certainly don't want to be prime minister.\" And in the evening, en route from the Olympic Park to Stratford International station, Boris was quizzed again. \"When are you going to be prime minister,\" asked a well-wisher. It's not up to me, he said. \u2022 It is up to the people. And the call could come. He knows it. Big Dave knows it. Poor Big Dave. While Boris is mobbed wherever he goes, the PM is reduced to recording a personal message to the Conservative party faithful, urging them to attend the annual conference in Birmingham \u2013 following fears that the event could be a flop. In a video posted on YouTube and on the official Conservative website, he promises that conference will provide them with opportunities to vent their frustrations with senior party figures in person \u2026 and in private \u2026 without the media present. He should take a blond wig. \u2022 Maybe he should take a leaf from Boris's book. Try never to be specific. No good comes of it. Take his discussion with Nick Ferrari on LBC radio in London on Wednesday about school playing fields. You've continued to sell them off, said Ferrari. \"That is simply not true,\" said Dave. What about the sale of playing fields at the Elliott School in Putney, south-west London, responded the GMB union. It is five acres, has six tennis courts and a full-sized football pitch. Sounds like a playing field. So was the PM being economical with the actualit\u00e9, we asked the Department for Education? No, it said. That sale has yet to be agreed by Michael Gove. But even that's not accurate. Here's an email from Gove's department, confirming that Lord Hill of Oareford \"has given consent for Elliott School to dispose of part of their playing fields to partly fund the regeneration of their remaining site\". He performed that dastardly deed \"on behalf of the secretary of state\". \u2022 Much debate, meanwhile, within the high-powered charity Venice in Peril, the fund launched in reaction to the ruinous floods of 1966. Some say the charity itself is now in peril, with a potentially ruinous split about direction. The focus has been on the scientific issues surrounding the natural dangers that confront Venice: the big picture approach. But a faction on the committee seems interested in a narrower focus \u2013 such as restoration projects. With the narrow-focus approach winning out, the charity has been hit by resignations: including that of chair Anna Somers Cocks and stalwarts Lord Norwich, Nathalie Brooke, Sir Ronald Grierson and David Landau. But there is also the issue of where the money is going to come from in the future. Venice in Peril isn't skint. It's well run. The charity itself still has \u00a3400,000 in the pot and can raise money for projects. But fundraising grows more difficult and, with that in mind, some feel that money might better be handed over to an existing fund for restoring worldwide monuments before it is eroded by such things as staff and admin costs. The cold wind blows. All charities are suffering. If Venice in Peril does succumb, like some decaying monument, it won't be the last. \u2022 Finally, the hunt goes on for two Sudanese athletes who trained at Teesside University and have since gone missing. They were here not for the Olympics, but to prepare for an event in Barcelona, the Sudanese ambassador says. Both are \"in the wind\", as they say, and both may change identities, the better to keep that low profile. Particularly the runner called Sadam Hussein.
