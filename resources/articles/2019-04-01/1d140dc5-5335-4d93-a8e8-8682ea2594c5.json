The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said plans to ease austerity only slightly over the next five years were \u201cunbelievable\u201d. It added that government spending would almost certainly need to increase by more than expected in the next few years, increasing the UK\u2019s GDP growth. The thinktank said the need to borrow more or increase taxes to fund the extra spending to cover the health and social care of older people should spark a debate that goes beyond the planned comprehensive spending review of Whitehall budgets, due this summer, to include a comprehensive tax review. Like most economic forecasters, NIESR said its predictions were based on a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit that maintained a high level of access for UK and EU businesses in each other\u2019s markets. Under this scenario, the UK economy is expected to grow by 1.4% this year, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021. The low level of GDP growth in relation to the population \u2013 GDP per capita \u2013 is expected to rise from 0.7% this year to 1.3% by 2021. The NIESR\u2019s director, Jagjit Chadha, said: \u201cWe expect public spending to rise more quickly than currently planned. That is likely to mean that the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal objectives will not be met.\u201d Garry Young, a NIESR analyst, added that Whitehall spending forecasts could not be maintained at the low levels documented in the last budget. Chadha\u2019s comments appeared to contradict the chancellor, Philip Hammond\u2019s, forecast at a hearing before a committee of MPs, when he said a clampdown on spending between now and the mid-2020s would allow future governments to choose between higher spending and reducing government debt. Hammond told MPs on the Treasury select committee the government was on track to meet its future fiscal targets and there was significant headroom in his budget for flexibility on spending or tax decisions, even though Brexit was stalling longer-term planning. Ministers have options, and that\u2019s a \u201cvery good place to be\u201d, said Hammond. However, he added that over the longer term: \u201cWe have to recognise that as the population ages, the pressure on public services and public spending will increase.\u201d He cited Brexit as one of the reasons business investment in Britain was significantly below what would normally be expected, depressing private sector growth. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to me that the principal reason is uncertainty created by the continuing process of working out how we are going to exit from the European Union,\u201d he said. NIESR said there was mounting evidence the economy was adversely affected by Brexit-related uncertainty and further delays were making the situation worse. Business and consumers were displaying greater pessimism about the UK\u2019s future prospects, it said. The economy has already lost 2.5% of GDP growth since the summer of 2016 and this was growth \u201cthat would never be recovered\u201d, it added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
