The body must encounter stress to make progress.\" Use the sauna for weight loss Boxers desperately trying to \"make the weight\" before a fight often don bin liners and sit in the sauna for a couple of hours. They'll lose a few pounds and be able to fight, but the cost can be huge: the dehydration can lead to collapse and death. The decreased mass isn't the result of fat melting away, but vital fluid being leached out. Steve Blades, personal trainer and moderator at muscletalk.co.uk, says: \"For most people, this loss will be replaced shortly afterwards with water, and often with the ingestion of simple sugars in carbohydrate-based sports drinks, which can actually prove detrimental to overall body-fat reduction. Saunas should be a relaxing treat rather than part of a body-fat reduction plan.\" Just do classes Whether your penchant is for yogalates, jazz boxercise or hips, bums, thighs &amp; tums, there's no doubt that classes can be beneficial to fitness. Don't think, though, that all you need do is group workouts. When you're spending so much time attempting to work out how to do the mirror image version of what the instructor's doing, you're unlikely to be fully present in the workout zone. So make sure you do plenty of extracurricular exercise on top of classwork. Mistreat your weights Just because Olympic weightlifters drop the bar once they've hoisted it above their heads, it doesn't mean you should. Lowering weights is as important as lifting them. Gavin Laird, strength coach and author of Training For Hypertrophy, is an advocate of putting on the brakes: \"The same muscles that move the weights up perform work in controlling the weights down as well. This action is a major stimulus for the remodelling of muscle tissue. If you just allow the weights to drop, you'll miss out on gains in both strength and muscle development.\" Expect instant results Any demolition expert will tell you it takes longer to create than to destroy. \"It won't change overnight,\" says Lee Hadden. \"By dedicating yourself to a consistent training plan, though, you should achieve small increments in progress that will lead to a physical transformation. The first six weeks of a strength-training programme are all about the nervous system becoming efficient at recruiting motor units of muscle fibres. The following six weeks lay a foundation for physiological change.\" Stay too long Train with weights for longer than 60 minutes in one session and your testosterone levels start to drop. Both men and women require the hormone for muscle development. As testosterone production drops, cortisol levels rise. Cortisol is the hormone that kicks in when our bodies appear to be under threat. It breaks down our protein stores for energy while protecting our fat stores. Since muscle is largely protein, this is clearly a bad thing: the muscles we're trying to build can end up eating themselves. \"A single session isn't too bad,\" says Neil Foster, sports nutritionist at supplement manufacturer Maximuscle, \"but when it becomes a habit, as well as hampering progress, sex drive and sperm count are likely to lower significantly, along with one's sense of wellbeing.\" Go five times in the first week of joining When you join a gym, the temptation is to try to make up for 30 years of inactivity in the first week. Don't. Working out every day will leave you riddled with DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). Whether you're running, rowing or whatever, you're damaging your body. When you rest, it repairs itself. \"Many people go hell for leather for a few weeks, then burn out before their body has had time to react,\" says Kent-based personal trainer Jenny Wildi. \"It's those who turn up twice a week, every week, and do a steady, sensible workout who get the results.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
