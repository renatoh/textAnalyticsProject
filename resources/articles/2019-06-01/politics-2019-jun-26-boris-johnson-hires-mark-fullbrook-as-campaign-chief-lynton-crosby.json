The frontrunner to be prime minister has beefed up his team with two senior advisers: Iain Duncan Smith, who is his new campaign chairman, and Mark Fullbrook, an election consultant who works with Crosby. Fullbrook is now in charge of the day-to-day running of the campaign, taking over from the former MP James Wharton and Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary, who led the parliamentary phase of the contest. Campaign sources said Wharton and Williamson would still be \u201cintegral\u201d to Johnson\u2019s election effort but it had always been understood that they would step back when the focus turned to winning over Conservative members. Other senior male aides include Will Walden, Johnson\u2019s former media chief who is providing strategic advice; Oliver Lewis, his policy chief from Hanbury Strategy; Lee Cain, his chief media spokesman; Sir Edward Lister, who is in charge of transition; Ben Gascoigne, who has a private secretary style role; and Oliver Dowden MP and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who are also working on his path to No 10. A Johnson team source rejected the idea that all his most senior advisers were men, pointing to Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who has taken on a policy advisory role, and supportive female MPs such as Priti Patel. Another female team member is Shirley Walker-Williams, a former Foreign Office official, who is running operations. The Labour MP Jess Phillips said Johnson has \u201conce again shown what the women in his party and the women in the country can expect from him \u2013 to be ignored and forgotten\u201d, adding that \u201canyone would think he was lying when he said he was a feminist\u201d. Jo Swinson, a Lib Dem leadership contender, said: \u201cBoris is a man who talked about patting his female publisher on the bottom and described female Olympic athletes as glistening like wet otters. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t respect women in public; it shouldn\u2019t surprise people he doesn\u2019t want to listen to them in private either.\u201d Johnson has shaken up his team for the second phase of the leadership contest amid concerns among Eurosceptics that he was retreating from his commitment to leave on 31 October, which he reinforced on Tuesday. Some of Johnson\u2019s team have been rolling their eyes at Duncan Smith\u2019s claims to be in charge of the campaign, but he is seen as important in reassuring pro-Brexit supporters of Johnson that he will not resile from that pledge. Duncan Smith\u2019s position is thought to be that Johnson should be unleashed rather than hidden away during the campaign, as his personality is part of his appeal, regardless of gaffes. However, Fullbrook is the most powerful person on the campaign team, and he is in charge of daily operations, planning and strategy. The political consultant has a strong knowledge of the party base and its internal workings, which is seen as a key asset as Johnson seeks the votes of 160,000 members. Fullbrook helped run two successful London mayoral campaigns for Johnson but was also in charge of Zac Goldsmith\u2019s failed run against Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, which was accused of being racist and Islamophobic. He is an expert on polling and election strategy. Johnson speaks to Crosby, who also worked on his mayoral campaigns, every day but he is not officially involved this time, according to campaign sources. Figures from Johnson\u2019s time at City Hall have been tapped up to help with his \u201ctransition\u201d to No 10. MPs said Lister,Johnson\u2019s former deputy, was leading that team alongside Hancock and Dowden. Cain is Johnson\u2019s chief media spokesman, a former journalist who has advised several cabinet ministers and worked on the Vote Leave campaign. The FT reported that he would not necessarily follow his boss into No 10 as he may regard getting him there as \u201cjob done\u201d. Another influential media adviser is Richard Holden, an experienced operator who has worked as a special adviser for several cabinet ministers and at Conservative central office. Rosie Bate-Williams, a former Tory press officer, is handling regional media. On policy, Johnson has given a job to Truss, one of his early backers. However, Lewis has the title of policy chief, and there are numerous others on the team, including a former adviser at City Hall, Alex Crowley, and Ben Mallet, an international elections expert. Johnson\u2019s team Iain Duncan Smith Johnson once supported the Europhile centrist Ken Clarke for the leadership of the Conservative party instead of the eventual winner, the Maastricht rebel Duncan Smith. Now he has appointed Duncan Smith as chair of his leadership campaign to keep Eurosceptics on board. Mark Fullbrook The business partner of Lynton Crosby is an expert on polling and election strategy and has been brought in to professionalise the operation. James Wharton The former MP has been running Johnson\u2019s campaign so far and has been in charge of negotiations over broadcast appearances and hustings, but Fullbrook appears to be taking control of the operation. Will Walden Walden was Johnson\u2019s closest aide at City Hall and during the Vote Leave campaign. He went into the private sector to work for PR firm Edelman but has returned to provide strategic advice. Sir Edward Lister Johnson\u2019s former deputy\u2019s at City Hall is seen as a grownup who gets things done. He is in charge of the \u201ctransition\u201d to Downing Street. Carrie Symonds The role of Johnson\u2019s girlfriend is unclear as she has no official position on the team but she has had an influence on making over his image. Johnson campaign sources have indicated that people close to her released a photograph of the pair together after police were called to her flat following a late-night altercation between them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
