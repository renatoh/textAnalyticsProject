All the pieces will be presented without authors' names attached, so the audience will have to identify the voices of the more famous writers. \"What is most remarkable is that writers now are so clearly influenced by the writers of then, most particularly Pinter, whose Umbrellas is one of the plays we are producing,\" said Croft. When Nottingham Playhouse moved into its home in the early 1960s, its three artistic directors \u2013 Peter Ustinov, John Neville and Frank Dunlop \u2013 commissioned a series of short sketch plays and revues. The revival of a selection of these works will run from Thursday to Saturday alongside new commissions from writers including Nick Wood, Michael Eaton, Michelle Vacciana and the winner of the new Neville Prize competition for new writing, Clare Cole. \"The themes that run through both the plays we have chosen and the ones that we didn't are: immigration, the threat of nuclear war, loneliness and class. With one of them \u2013 Then And Now by Shelagh Delaney \u2013 we have given a contemporary writer (Michelle Vacciana) the task of writing a third part to what was a two-part play, because the themes are so current that it would have been odd not to have had a present-day conclusion to the story,\" Croft explained. The Lost Plays Revue will coincide with the official naming of the John Neville Studio at the Nottingham Playhouse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
