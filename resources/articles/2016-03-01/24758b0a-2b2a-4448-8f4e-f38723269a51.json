The man, a 27-year-old, was taken into custody after an all-night police operation near the rural town of Kawerau in the Bay of Plenty. The siege followed an incident on Wednesday afternoon when a police surveillance plane \u2013 allegedly looking for cannabis plants \u2013 was shot. Later in the day four policemen received gunshot wounds and authorities cordoned off a rural property where an alleged gunman had barricaded himself inside. One officer received serious but not life-threatening injuries, two received moderate injuries and one received a gunshot wound to the hand, police said. Around 2pm on Wednesday the alleged gunman\u2019s friends and family set up a vigil at a police cordon, where they remained all night in deck chairs, draped in hoodies and blankets, and shared a meal and snacks. Family members told Fairfax New Zealand that they were in touch with the man via text messages, and they wanted a police escort into the house so they could talk to their relative. Just after 9am on Thursday, a Maori police liaison officer, Warwick Morehu, entered the cordon area, and an arrest was made \u2013 peacefully \u2013 a short time later. After the arrest the alleged gunman\u2019s family and friends were seen holding a karakia (prayer) and speaking to Morehu, who was dressed in plain clothes. Two of the police officers who were shot remain in a stable condition in hospital, and two have been discharged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
