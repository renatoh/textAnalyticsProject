I remember the exact moment this changed. I am fairly sure I've related this anecdote before, but I'll bore you with it again - one doesn't get to stand in the very wings of history many times, so when one does, one feels entitled to bang on about it. So, anyway, I was at a New York fashion week party at a Japanese restaurant in the West Village the night Kate Moss showed up in a one-shoulder lemon-yellow cocktail dress. In the annals of modern fashion history, this is pretty much on a par with being there for the moon landings. So we all sat around competitively not-eating sashimi and discussing the fact that Kate was wearing yellow while pretending not to be looking at her. (I know! How jealous are you of these crazy fashion parties?) And after that, a yellow party dress became the go-to look for skinny models with suntans. Most civilians still file yellow away under Stuff That Looks Good Only On Agyness Deyn And Kate Moss. But if you're ever going to try it, now is the time, if only because this summer's lemon and mango shades are a lot easier to wear than the egg-yolk yellow that will be around come autumn, inspired by the relaunch of Ossie Clark. Citrus summer camp, before the hard work begins next term, if you will. Summer is also the easiest time to wear yellow because the vexed question of what to wear with it is simpler. For maximum on-trend points, team with navy. White is good, although a bit girlish; camel or tan is more sophisticated. There are only two Bs to avoid: bumblebee (ie, wearing with black) and Battenberg (ie, wearing with pink). And even they can look good - although only on Agyness Deyn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
