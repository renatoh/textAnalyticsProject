The study by accounting group KPMG follows warnings from politicians and British scientists that the UK's science base would be further sapped if Pfizer's proposed takeover of AstraZeneca goes ahead. KPMG said foreign ownership of UK manufacturers was limiting R&amp;D budgets in Britain because investment in this area tended to made in the parent companies' home countries. John Leech, head of automotive at KPMG in the UK, said: \"Our report highlights that the UK has slipped behind our peers in R&amp;D spending which brings the current proposed acquisition of AstraZeneca by Pfizer into sharper focus. The UK manufacturers are typically overseas owned and these companies tend to spend more of their R&amp;D in their home countries rather than in the UK. The problem is we don't have many AstraZenecas. We haven't necessarily got the higher paid R&amp;D jobs. It's the result of having overseas owners in the sector.\" UK companies surveyed in KPMG's global manufacturing report said a lack of R&amp;D funding was the main issue limiting innovation. Development work was heavily focused on improving existing products and services, with 71% of UK companies spending in this area. In contrast just 29% were focused on breakthrough innovation. Leech said there were no UK companies listed in the top 100 innovators in 2013 named by Thomson Reuters. There were 45 US companies, 28 Japanese companies and 12 from France. \"I think the UK government gets this and has been supporting large UK manufacturers in their R&amp;D efforts, even those who are overseas-owned,\" he said. The latest official figures showed UK spending on R&amp;D was \u00a327bn in 2012. At 1.7% of GDP, Britain's R&amp;D spending is less than the European average and falls far behind Finland's 3.6% and Germany's 2.9%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
