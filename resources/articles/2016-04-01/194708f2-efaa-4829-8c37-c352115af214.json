Gently, Tom Hiddleston has pointed out that the story \u201cfeels complete\u201d. His co-star, Hugh Laurie, last spotted, as Richard Roper, in the hands of incensed assassins, said: \u201cIn cold, practical terms, no, we\u2019re done.\u201d But precedent gives us hope. Homeland persisted, years after the death of Damian Lewis\u2019s Brody. Sherlock survived that tumble off a hospital rooftop, as well as one down the Reichenbach Falls. And now, surpassing even Conan Doyle\u2019s magnificent disregard for continuity, Andrew Wakefield, the terminally disgraced British doctor, has unexpectedly returned, if not exactly from the dead, certainly as if his medical career had never been killed off, his reputation shattered. In his new documentary, Vaxxed, Wakefield, the baddy last heard of sloping off to the US, it was assumed to live out his days in repentant obscurity, returns in glory as humanity\u2019s saviour. To see him in a Vaxxed trailer, introduced as Andrew Wakefield, MB, BS, gastroenterologist, is to meet a fully functioning medic seemingly unrelated to the unethical individual who destroyed public confidence in the MMR \u2013 measles, mumps and rubella \u2013 vaccine in 1998 (in a paper since withdrawn by the Lancet), needlessly putting thousands of unvaccinated children at risk of illness and disability. At the same time, the journalist Brian Deer discovered, he was building the market for an alternative product, from which he stood to profit. The doctor was struck off in 2010 for \u201cserious professional misconduct\u201d. Although purportedly a factual work, Vaxxed, to judge by numerous early reviews, transports viewers to a world where none of the above ever happened. In this parallel world, it is the immunisers, not the former gastroenterologist, who go in for cover-ups. So comprehensively is contradictory evidence ignored here that Wakefield permits himself the liberty of rehashing some of his earlier \u2013 utterly discredited \u2013 claims, which seemed good reason to many of us, in 1998, to worry about the MMR jab. The Lancet piece warned of \u201cdevelopmental regression\u201d. This time, he throws in the prediction that, if MMR usage continues, half of all America\u2019s boys will be on the autistic spectrum by 2032. To be fully apocalyptic, his message requires autism itself to be portrayed \u2013 deploying footage of distressed-looking children \u2013 as an invariably frightful diagnosis. It is as if Wakefield wants parents to panic anew with the same, injurious consequences for the understanding of autism. Doctors, and others aware of Wakefield\u2019s agenda, have been protesting about the baseless anxiety that Vaxxed sets out to generate \u2013 and quite successfully, in that the film was withdrawn from the Tribeca film festival. One father of a boy with autism, the film director Todd Drezner, has written an open letter to the film\u2019s distributors that itemises Vaxxed\u2019s dishonesties \u2013 and dismisses their own absurd claims, post-Tribeca, of censorship. It concludes: \u201cI hope that sometime in the future you may find ways to undo the damage you are about to cause.\u201d But powerful as it is, Drezner\u2019s reproach, along with objections from doctors, must compete with support for Wakefield\u2019s film from another prominent parent of a child with autism. Unfortunately for herd immunity, that parent is Robert De Niro. It was only because of De Niro\u2019s intervention that the film was initially included in the Tribeca festival, which he co-founded. And although it has been withdrawn, the ensuing fuss has only increased awareness of Wakefield\u2019s film and, possibly, as damagingly as anything contained in it, of its celebrity endorsement. Wakefield, the obscure medical fraudster, is esteemed by a Hollywood star of such immeasurable stature and influence that great US Democrats prostrate themselves for his approval. In 2011, De Niro\u2019s second championship of Obama itself made news, when he attacked \u201cbirthers\u201d such as Donald Trump who contended that President Obama is not a \u201cnatural-born\u201d American. \u201cDon\u2019t go out there and say things unless you can back them up,\u201d he said. \u201cHow dare you? That\u2019s awful to do.\u201d This year, on the 40th anniversary of Taxi Driver, De Niro\u2019s name is high on a US checklist of Hillary Clinton supporters, just behind the Clooneys and Kardashians. And too bad for science: he also backs Wakefield. Regretting the withdrawal of the documentary, De Niro said on the Today show: \u201cI think the movie is something people should see.\u201d Questioned, this time, about the facts, ones that undermine Wakefield\u2019s claims, he said: \u201cI believe it\u2019s much more complicated than that. There is a link and they are saying there isn\u2019t and there are... other things there.\u201d To counter this, the scientific camp would need to recruit, from Clinton\u2019s supporters, at least Matt Damon, Tom Hanks and Lena Dunham, and maybe, as insurance, Ryan Gosling, from the edgier crowd backing Sanders. If Vaccinating With the Stars looks a little inappropriate where public health is concerned, so too is the prospect of children falling ill because an actor clearly hasn\u2019t read Wakefield\u2019s Wikipedia entry. Unless, worse still, he has. Failing such an intervention, the most effective way for doctors to limit Vaxxed\u2019s damage might be to advertise the names \u2013 and theories \u2013 of some of De Niro\u2019s existing sympathisers, who include Jim Carrey and Donald Trump. The latter suggests \u201cmonster shots\u201d are behind an \u201cepidemic\u201d of autism. In fact, if these star endorsements have any value, some Democrat-voting pro-Wakefield De Niro fans must now be agonising over how best to respond to the world\u2019s finest method actor. Do they support Clinton? Or Trump, against the MMR? Maybe the former Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe, could be persuaded to adjudicate. All that spell-casting must have given him some insight into epidemiology. It would be rude to the celebrities, as well as inconsistent, to dismiss their instincts, where vaccinations are concerned, as irrelevant. In Britain, as in the US, all political camps cherish a star endorsement, with the obvious exception of any intervention by Russell Brand. Ditto Emma Thompson\u2019s representations, on a number of subjects. Remainers will be praying for no repetition of Nanny McPhee\u2019s remarks on British rain and cake. Generally, however, the pause in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s noted impassivity, when he was approved by the US actor Danny DeVito testifies to the political joy when a bankable entertainer takes sides. As for the artists, it is hardly surprising if some respond to such appreciation with advocacy on anything from the refugee crisis, tuna fishing, the BBC and BP\u2019s sponsorship of Tate Modern, \u00a3175m \u201cgarden\u201d bridges, the Elgin Marbles, the wrongness of air travel (for non-industry fliers) and, in the current case, the factitious link between MMR and autism. Which stars should we listen to? I\u2019d go for Oscar winners only, were it not that De Niro, Andrew Wakefield\u2019s priceless ally, has a well-deserved two. \u2022 Comments will be opened later today"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
