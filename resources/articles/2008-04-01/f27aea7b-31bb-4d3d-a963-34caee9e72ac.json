But one letter stands out in the morning post: an official-looking envelope marked Scotland Yard. It informs him that he is being investigated under the Obscene Publications Act, and that he may have to appear in court. Someone has accused the poet of buying pornography - a charge that happens to be true. Later that day, as Larkin wends his way back home, a police inspector approaches him and announces that he is very interested in his literary tastes ... Will it all end with Larkin behind bars? Find out in Mr Larkin's Awkward Day (2.15pm, R4). Chris Harrald's comedy, based on a true incident, stars Adrian Scarborough. Elsewhere, Radio 2 is repeating its attempt to convince listeners that Cliff Richard is a serious musician. Icons Revisited (10.30pm), presented by the great Cilla Black, also reveals the one ambition that the Bachelor Boy is still desperate to achieve. And, speaking of national embarrassments, File On 4 (8pm, Radio 4) is looking at Heathrow's Terminal Five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
