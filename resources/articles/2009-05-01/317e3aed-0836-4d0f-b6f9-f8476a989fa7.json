Hatton weighed-in on the light welterweight limit of 140lb in front of a raucous crowd of around 4,500 fans, including a strong contingent of his supporters who had made the trip from Britain. Pacquiao, fighting for only the third time above 130lb, came in at 138lb, seven pounds lighter than his most recent trip to the scales last December when he went on to stop Oscar De La Hoya. \"I never struggle making the weight,\" Hatton said during an interview on stage after the weigh-in. \"That may shock people with the amount of weight I put on [in between fights] but I always do a 12-week training camp and I do it properly. I'll be ready tomorrow. Size and strength will be a big factor in the fight.\" Hatton said he was drawing his confidence not only from his size and speed, but also from his technique as he admitted he has improved his repertoire. \"I'm boxing better now, creating angles and my hand speed is improving,\" he said. \"There's no reason why I shouldn't be confident. The key is to make him miss and make him pay. That's what we've been working on.\" Pacquiao was also feeling good following the weigh in, although he admitted the level of expectation from his huge army of fans from the Philippines and the ex-pat community in the US was starting to get to him. \"I feel strong,\" the Filipino superstar said. \"We don't know yet what way it's going to go or what's going to happen but I'll do my best. I am still hungry for this fight as I was for the last fight. \"I feel the pressure a bit but I have to do my best, do my job in the ring and make people happy. Ricky is not easy to fight, he's a strong, good fighter and I don't want to underestimate him.\" Hatton also paid tribute to his supporters, who have been arriving in force in Las Vegas since Thursday night. \"I've just heard the official numbers and there are 25,000 Brits coming over to see me,\" Hatton said. \"It's going to be an honour to fight for you guys on Saturday night and you will not go home disappointed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
