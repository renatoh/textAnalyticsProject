Indeed the first few lines of yesterday's press release from the Conservative party strive to set out some serious points: the rise of tuberculosis within the UK and the need to minimise public health risks. If they had been better researched they could have added some startling figures: a 25% increase of the disease in 10 years, with 7,000 new cases being diagnosed every year, two-thirds of whom were born abroad. But the Conservatives' latest move was not prompted by health needs. It was motivated by party electoral needs. The first page of its four-page release gives the game away with its distorted assertion, set out in bold black type: \"At the next election people will face a clear choice: limited and controlled immigration with the Conservatives or unlimited immigration under Mr Blair.\" This is not the first time the Tory party has proposed such a scheme. Twenty months ago, they made a similar proposal, which included checks on asylum seekers too. The all-party parliamentary group on Aids countered that such tests would be impractical, expensive, unjust, dangerous and, for asylum seekers, a breach of the European convention on human rights. Little had been heard from the Tories on this issue until yesterday. Now, undaunted, they have repeated the old call, but now exempting refugees, children and pregnant women. This fails to answer the questions raised both by the MPs and by ministers, who have been running TB checks on people from high-risk countries for some years but have only found about 100 infectious cases out of 185,000 tests. An Institute for Public Policy Research report pointed out 15 months ago that unless ministers were ready to screen everybody, the only alternative was an enormously expensive pre-entry screening in migrants' home states. Alas, ministers have now been lured into this wrong option. Contrary to Michael Howard's untrue assertion, immigration to this country remains strictly controlled. No one from outside the EU can come here to study or work without a permit. Many millions more need a visa just to visit. Some 40,000 are refused an extension, 50,000 are turned back at ports of entry, and another 200,000 are refused permission by British consulates overseas. Currently the calmest people in this bidding war between the two main parties remain the public. Despite the frenetic efforts of Mr Howard, public concern about asylum actually declined in last week's polls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
