He must have felt like a failed beekeeper, whose swarm has gone berserk. Every few seconds he had to bat away another ferocious attack. Few people like this bill - not even, it is said, Mr Clarke himself. It is one of the curiosities of New Labour that MPs make passionate speeches against, rave and bellow at the minister, and yet mysteriously the thing goes through anyway. As David Winnick put it: \"If this measure were on a free vote, it would certainly be thrown out.\" Mr Clarke gravely divided his speech into five sections and announced that he would take interventions at the end of each passage. But demented insects don't understand that kind of thing, and they were up and buzzing round his head all the time he spoke. Obviously, said Boris Johnson, the government wanted to make the card compulsory. When they do, what will the penalty be? No answer came. Diane Abbott thought it would make race relations worse. And, MPs asked, what about the Irish? They are the only foreigners in Britain who don't need passports. Would they be the only folk in the land without ID cards? Why should people pay for a card which was about to be compulsory, asked Tony Wright. How would the cards stop terrorists? They hadn't in Madrid, as several people pointed out. The cost of the card, estimated by some at \u00a3230, was the same as poor families pay for a month's food. (\"Eat up your crunchy card, my lamb, that's all I can offer you ...\") Mr Clarke, who had left be hind his beekeeper's hat with protective veil, was driven to distraction. As Lynne Jones, an opponent of the cards, tried to interrupt him yet again, he lost it. \"I've told you, I will give way later!\" he barked at her, and the Tories all went \"Whooo!\" in that camp way they enjoy. And suppose you needed an ID card for basic public services, such as borrowing a book? Who would pay for the biometric machines to read your eyes? \"No library books for the Irish!\" yelled someone merrily. Finally Mr Clarke finished his speech, and was allowed to sit down. The bees seemed to relax too. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, was almost left alone, apart from a few kindly interventions. Every speech Mr Davis makes now is part of his leadership bid, and this was a good one, full of resonant phrases. ID cards were \"a clear and present threat to the freedoms and liberties of the British people.\" The bill was not just excessive but also expensive, not just illiberal but impractical, not just unnecessary but unworkable. It would oblige us all \"to sign up to be members of our own country\". It abolished the ancient precept that you were free to do what you wished, provided there was no law against it. It was, he said, warming to the topic, a plastic poll tax, the symbol of the government's wish to centralise and control everything, at the expense of our freedom. This was a stirring call to the colours, and Tory MPs loved it. So, I suspect, in private, did many Labour MPs. Yet Mr Davis remains a sadly uninspiring speaker. He gobbles and swallows his words. Suddenly he realises that he has gone too fast, and he slows down hurriedly, like a Virgin train stop-starting its way to Manchester. \"Gabble, gabble, gabble\" he goes, then with a squeal of brakes: \"What. So. Ever!\" The effect is a little like hearing Nessun Dorma performed by that bloke in Coldplay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
