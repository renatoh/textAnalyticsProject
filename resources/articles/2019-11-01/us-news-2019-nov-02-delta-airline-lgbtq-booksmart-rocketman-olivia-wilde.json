Delta faced criticism after it emerged it was showing films with edits that seemingly targeted gay and lesbian sexuality. The actor Olivia Wilde said a version of the movie Booksmart, which she directed, omitted a lesbian sex scene, a female masturbation scene, the words \u201cvagina\u201d and \u201cgenitals\u201d and an animated sequence in which the two main characters turn into naked dolls. She also pointed out that the word \u201cfuck\u201d was not cut from the scene in which \u201cvagina\u201d was muted. \u201cWhat message is this sending to viewers and especially to women?\u201d Wilde wrote on Twitter. \u201cThat their bodies are obscene? That their sexuality is shameful?\u201d Delta previously attracted opprobrium for showing a version of Rocketman, the Elton John biopic starring Tarron Egerton, which removed any reference to the musician\u2019s sexual orientation. The airline said the edits were made, unrequested, by a third-party vendor, with Delta picking the version for in-flight viewing. It said it has now put in place new measures to ensure the movies do not omit the LGBTQ scenes. \u201cStudios often provide videos in two forms: a theatrical, original version and an edited version,\u201d a Delta spokeswoman said. \u201cWe selected the edited version and now realize content well within our guidelines was unnecessarily excluded from both films. We are working to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. \u201cThe studio has agreed to provide a special Delta edit that retains the LGBTQ+ love scenes in both Booksmart and Rocketman that will be on our flights as soon as possible.\u201d Wilde said thank you on Twitter. The spokeswoman said it was not Delta\u2019s practice to omit LGBTQ love scenes, pointing to fuller in-flight versions of series and movies including Gentleman Jack and Moonlight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
