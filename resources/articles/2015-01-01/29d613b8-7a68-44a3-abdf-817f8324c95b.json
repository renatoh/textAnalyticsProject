The Leicester centre sustained a groin problem in October and missed the autumn internationals, although he was at one point expected to return before Christmas. Complications during rehabilitation mean he has been unable to set a comeback date and could miss the entire Six Nations. The 23-year-old did not rule himself out of the tournament, which begins on 6 February, but admitted a return by the end of that month might be the best possible outcome. Leicester had targeted a comeback in January but the player stated that he did not want to rush his return. The Samoa-born centre does not believe surgery on the injury will be an option but he has undertaken a series of injections to the groin. \u201cIt\u2019s slow,\u201d Tuilagi said. \u201cI had three prolotherapy injections \u2013 sugar \u2013 to try to bring the pubis back together. It\u2019s slow but it\u2019s getting there. No one\u2019s really sure how long it\u2019s going to take. When it first happened even the doctor said it would be six to eight weeks.\u201d Asked when he could return, Tuilagi said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure. With this you have to just take it day by day and make sure it\u2019s better before you try to come back. There are good days and bad days. Some days it feels brilliant and you wake up the next day and it doesn\u2019t feel so good. \u201c[The end of February is] ideal but I have to get this right. It\u2019s not like a sprained ankle where you can strap up and get on with it. I have to make sure that, if I need to take another week or two, I\u2019ll take it. \u201cThe World Cup is in the back of your mind. But for me I\u2019m not worried about anything else but trying to get fit and then playing for Leicester and hopefully for England.\u201d It is the latest blow for Stuart Lancaster, who will name his Six Nations squad on Wednesday. The England head coach will be without Courtney Lawes for the opening two matches after the Northampton second-row underwent an ankle operation and another lock, Joe Launchbury of Wasps, will miss the whole tournament following neck surgery.
