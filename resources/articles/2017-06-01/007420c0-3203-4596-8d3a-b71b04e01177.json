Farron said he firmly believed that terror attacks, such as those in London and Manchester over the past weeks, should not motivate an increase in censorship or invasions of privacy. \u201cWhat do the [terrorists] want us to do?\u201d he said. \u201cTo give up on our freedoms and our liberties \u2013 those are the things we must not sacrifice otherwise the terrorists will have won.\u201d The Lib Dem leader was the first to take the stage in Edinburgh at the second of the Question Time leaders\u2019 specials. It was originally scheduled for Sunday night but postponed after the London Bridge attack. David Dimbleby, the programme\u2019s regular presenter, was unable to host the event because of preparations for Thursday\u2019s general election programme, so Nick Robinson hosted the programme, which also featured Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader. Farron said the programme had been \u201crightly postponed ... to pay tribute to those who passed away, to stand in solidarity with their loved ones and the injured\u201d. He said that he had felt angry that the \u201cutter wickedness\u201d of the attacks could happen both in London and Manchester. \u201cWas it because of a lack of surveillance or a lack of resources?\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me that we have the powers to follow and track criminals ... what we don\u2019t have is sufficient pairs of eyes and pairs of hands in our security services and our police forces in order to pursue them and catch them. \u201cWe are much safer if we invest in our police and our security services. The cuts that Theresa May has made in her years as home secretary and then prime minister have not made us safer.\u201d Farron was challenged over his party manifesto which pledged to \u201croll back\u201d state surveillance, starting with the so-called \u201csnoopers\u2019 charter\u201d on data retention which the Lib Dems opposed in coalition. \u201cWhat we have at the moment is an ever-widening haystack and we are looking for a needle and the answer is not to put more hay into the haystack, it\u2019s to put more magnets around the haystacks so we can find the needles,\u201d he said. \u201cOur security services need the ability to catch and trace people, but the evidence is not there to support the widening of powers,\u201d he went on, citing the single use of temporary exclusion orders to prevent suspected terrorists from re-entering the country. \u201cIt was used once,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have the powers.\u201d Farron said that he was not in favour of routinely arming police, but said more investment was needed in training and recruiting armed officers. \u201cWe are the party that want to back our police. It\u2019s easy and tempting for politicians to come up with a knee-jerk response. People are seeking answers and want to see action,\u201d he said. Khuram Butt, one of the three attackers who drove a van into pedestrians near London\u2019s Borough Market and then attacked members of the public with knives, was apparently reported to anti-terror police by acquaintances, who have claimed that their concerns were ignored. Another of the London attackers, Rachid Redouane, was not known to the police or MI5, the police said. Farron said it was essential the police retained the trust of the Muslim community. \u201cThe community out there are desperate to tackle terrorism and the police do not have the resources to enable them to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the priority must be.\u201d Farron, who is a practising Christian, saw his early campaign dogged by questions over his attitude towards gay sex and abortion. Asked if he was conflicted between his faith and his politics, Farron said being a liberal and being religious were both parts of his identity. \u201cAll these things make up who I am and you are all the blend of different identities ... in a society like this which is so diverse and so balanced,\u201d he said. The Lib Dem leader denied he believed homosexuality was a sin. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who wants to go round talking about my faith all the time \u2026 I\u2019m not running to be the pope. I\u2019m a political leader, not a religious one.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon appeared to take a firmer stance on whether the SNP would agree to anti-Tory pact with Labour if Jeremy Corbyn won the election on Thursday, telling one questioner she would be interested in her MPs joining \u201ca progressive alliance\u201d at Westminster. The Tories have accused Sturgeon of planning to \u201cprop up\u201d a minority Labour government and claimed Corbyn wanted to do a deal with the SNP \u2013 claims that Sturgeon and Corbyn have rejected. Pressed during the election campaign on whether she would support a minority Labour government, the SNP leader insisted last week she would not back a coalition but would back Labour issue by issue \u201cto put forward progressive policies and see a progressive agenda\u201d. But in an apparent change of stance, Sturgeon told the Question Time audience: \u201cI certainly would want to be part of an alliance, a more progressive alliance, if the arithmetic allowed it, that would keep the Tories out of power.\u201d She said would never drop her demands for a new independence referendum immediately after Brexit to make it easier to strike a longterm deal with Labour. Like Farron, Sturgeon expressed reservations about greater state surveillance and and anti-terrorism powers. She refused to commit the SNP to supporting Theresa May\u2019s call for tougher powers, having previously voted against the so-called \u201csnoopers charter\u201d. She told the audience that \u201cknee-jerk responses were often the wrong ones,\u201d and the security forces already had wide-ranging powers. However, Sturgeon said the SNP would study very carefully any proposals that might come forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
