Yet his first hours in office, when he sacked 18 of his cabinet ministers and promised a top team that looked like \u201cmodern Britain\u201d, set teeth on edge among Tory MPs in parliament. Arriving back at Downing Street after an hour of defenestrations in his new House of Commons office, Johnson installed leading faces of Vote Leave in the top jobs: Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom. Inside, his staff look like the referendum backroom team reassembled, including Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, his new director of communications. \u201cHe has effectively got Vote Leave back together,\u201d one Johnson-backing MP said. \u201cAnd if I was the Spartans [the hardcore Brexiters who have resisted voting for a deal], or the Labour party, I would be scared of them because they are very, very good. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody else in politics better than them at campaigning. It\u2019s a wink saying, \u2018I might just have an election, you know\u2019. And that\u2019s all deliberate. The Labour and Conservative mutual interest is in not having an election before Brexit is done. So that is the way you get the deal through. It\u2019s vote for the deal or hold an election.\u201d Another frontbencher said an election now looked like an implicit threat. \u201cDoing this helps you get a deal through \u2013 you look ready,\u201d the MP said. \u201cIt is such an obvious play, as is filling your cabinet with all these potential rebels and sacking the people who will vote for you anyway.\u201d The appointments have not only unnerved the soft wing of the party. Cummings\u2019s appointment has also alienated a number of Eurosceptics. One source said veteran Brexiters including Johnson\u2019s campaign chair Iain Duncan Smith, Bill Cash and Owen Paterson were furious. Cummings, a former director of Vote Leave, where he clashed repeatedly with old-time Eurosceptics, had previously worked for IDS, but then publicly branded him \u201cincompetent\u201d. For a politician given to rambling speeches, Johnson\u2019s first afternoon as prime minister was ruthlessly efficient. He was greeted at the door of No 10 with a firm handshake from the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, but the new prime minister spent barely half an hour inside the black door with his new civil servants before he jumped in his motorcade to parliament to set the wrecking ball on May\u2019s cabinet. \u201cThere is a sense of urgency,\u201d one source close to Johnson said. \u201cHe has always made clear he wanted this done straight away.\u201d Johnson spent just over an hour sacking ministers inside his Commons office, to spare them the humiliation of walking up Downing Street. The first, within minutes of Johnson\u2019s motorcade hitting the tarmac outside parliament, came as the biggest shock. Penny Mordaunt, the first female defence secretary, was out of her job after just two months. Allies of Mordaunt said she had been desperately keen to stay in her job, but the overnight briefing that it had been offered to Jeremy Hunt had been hurtful. \u201cShe was sacked. She did not resign or turn down anything else,\u201d one source close to Mordaunt said. Hunt was offered the job of defence secretary on Tuesday night and made it clear that he could not accept what he considered to be a demotion. One close ally said he was horrified that Mordaunt was then sacked and he was called in to be offered the job of defence again \u2013 and made that clear to Johnson. \u201cHow could Jeremy have done that to Penny, when she\u2019d been such an asset to the campaign?\u201d the source said. \u201cIt was unthinkable.\u201d As Johnson raced through the rest of his appointments, his leadership rival headed out for a long, boozy dinner with his friend and fellow sacked departee, Liam Fox. \u201cSacking Jeremy was massively unnecessary,\u201d one of his team fumed. \u201cThat\u2019s 40% of the party who backed him \u2013 where on earth does this get Boris?\u201d Another high-profile Hunt backer called the promotions of Raab and Patel in particular, as Hunt and Mordaunt went the other way, \u201cquite difficult for a lot of us\u201d. A shake-up had been expected, but only the previous night Johnson had promised \u201cthe lovebombing starts here\u201d to MPs at the backbench 1922 Committee. \u201cThis is more like an actual bomb,\u201d one MP said. A passing minister, watching some of the cars depart, said: \u201cI hope Boris has thought about this properly.\u201d Another MP, a close friend and former colleague of Johnson, said he had not expected such mass firings. \u201cI know these guys really well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this surprises even me.\u201d Some gave a more cutting verdict of the departing ministers and several observed that they were all people who could be relied on not to rebel. \u201cThe political strategy is, he knows he must get a deal through \u2013 and these people will vote for anything,\u201d one frontbencher said. \u201cIt is very bold \u2013 but how many of those who were sacked would you really want in your cabinet? Who is going to honestly get outraged about Karen Bradley or Chris Grayling or James Brokenshire?\u201d Several of those who had waited to be sacked rather than walk already knew their time was up. The outgoing business secretary Greg Clark \u2013 who did not pre-emptively resign \u2013 did hold pre-emptive leaving drinks, carrying trays of wine for his team late into the evening on the Commons terrace on Tuesday night. Four resignations came even before Johnson entered No 10, though none was surprising. The chancellor Philip Hammond and the justice secretary David Gauke made pointed comments in the closed doors speeches before handing in their resignations. Hammond gave his closest aides red wine and crisps in his office on Tuesday evening, before chatting to Treasury civil servants on his way out on Wednesday. \u201cHe said people should keep an eye on his Twitter and he expects to be a lot more active,\u201d one Treasury source said. \u201cHe underlined how important it would be for the incoming chancellor to have a smooth relationship with No 10.\u201d Hammond\u2019s resignation letter devoted precious little space to praising his outgoing boss. Gauke, the departing justice secretary, gave a farewell speech to staff inside the Ministry of Justice, where sources said he used his own parting blow to loudly champion the need for an independent and bold civil service. The new machine still had a few loose cogs. Despite an overnight press release that briefed that Tracey Crouch would be handed a big cabinet job, it appeared no one from Johnson\u2019s team had bothered to check whether that would be OK with her. She said she would prefer to spend the summer with her young son. Some MPs still expected a further clear-out of the junior ranks. Even so, MPs said they expected many of Johnson\u2019s beaming acolytes to be disappointed. Some have already taken roles below what they had hoped for \u2013 both Liz Truss and Matt Hancock had publicly lobbied for the roles of chancellor or business secretary. \u201cI don\u2019t know how unhappy Matt will be, to be honest,\u201d one MP said of Hancock, who will stay as health secretary. \u201cHe looked this morning like someone who was extremely worried he was about to have his head chopped off.\u201d One minister likened the number of supporters expecting jobs to an overbooked easyJet flight: \u201cEveryone thinks they\u2019ve got a seat, but some aren\u2019t even on the waiting list. Some are just looking hopefully at their compensation vouchers in the lounge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
