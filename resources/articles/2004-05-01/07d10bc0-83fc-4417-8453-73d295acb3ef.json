We saw blogging as a great way to write about the things we were thinking about, but couldn't express in the limited, formal space of the print section. We hoped we might get a little feedback, start something of a conversation. Little did we know what it would kick off... But back then, we couldn't do Onlineblog on Guardian Unlimited for a host of perfectly sensible technical reasons. So we did as we suggested our readers do: we opened a Blogger.com account, hired some server space, hacked something together, and launched. The site has not changed much since. We had a revamp in late 2002, which tied us a little more closely with the new Online channel on Guardian Unlimited. But we were still using Blogger on that rented server, and this page is still something cobbled together by me using borrowed code and some bits of string. It's been hugely rewarding for us to do, but it has been ready to move to the next level for a long time now. So it's with some excitement that I can say, finally, this week (and don't make me promise exactly when), we're becoming a proper part of the Guardian Unlimited network. It means we're going to do some uncool things \u2013 like asking you to redirect bookmarks to new URL, and re-point RSS readers to a new home \u2013 but we think the benefits will outweigh the temporary inconvenience. The site's going to look a lot better, for a start \u2013 like a regular GU site. It'll be more visible to more readers, and a more integrated part of what we do in print and online. It'll be running on a properly maintained network, with backup and lots of bandwidth, using Movable Type (finally!). We'll have categories, and a good archive search. And, best of all, it'll herald the start of a new experiment with blogging at Guardian Unlimited, as we begin to explore the forms of journalism this technology makes possible. There's much more to come on this front, I promise. But that's for later. In the meantime, we're really excited by the move, and hope you'll join us in our new home later this week. Things will continue as normal here until the move \u2013 but bear with us if the packing boxes get in the way. And if we're still here at the weekend\u2026 well, you know how troublesome these things can be..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
