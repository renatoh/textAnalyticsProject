The crop of Ashes books, for example, has given work to countless ghost writers who would otherwise have had to scrape a pittance on BA Business Life magazine. And the replica kit manufacturers working round the clock must have inspired a fair few little lads and lasses to dream of one day having their very own sweatshop. Christmas morning saw thousands of kids weeping with disappointment because their parents hadn't been able to track down a Freddie Flintoff Wormwood bat. What finer tribute could there be to Vaughanie's lads' efforts this summer? The team's Xmas single, Goughie being asked to join the cast of Chicago, Hoggy calling Tony Blair a knob - all these things have helped to keep cricket in the forefront of shoppers' minds and boost the health of the game. It all goes to show that real success is a holistic process that includes making money and becoming famous enough so they drive you around and give you loads of free stuff. This is very much the philosophy of Podivation, Dave Podmore's cricket-based training programme which has caught on big style this Ashes-winning year, with plenty of companies wanting their middle managers to meet the Podivation challenge and \"Dare to be Excellent\". We're not a sect as such, although we're trying to get status as a religion for tax purposes. Nevertheless, some ungrateful failures have seen fit to complain about the treatment they've had at my seminars. It's simply not true that we lock people up and starve them. It was unfortunate that the portakabin door got stuck on the same day the caterers chose to get arsey about being paid, but it was sorted within 48 hours. As for the libel that I copied the Australian swimming team's practice of staging mock executions in a field - what nonsense. We held them in a cellar and I got the idea from the South Africa rugby team who did it a few years earlier, or it might have been the Marines. Podivation is just one of several success stories that the usual brigade of nay-mongers are queueing up to criticise. Another is The Jacqui Podmore Ashes Exercise Video, which has been walking off the shelves in our local Asda - or it did after they lopped 10 quid off the price and gave away a four-pack of pasties with each tape. Jacqui's seen off Carol Vorderman's Reverse Swing DVD, which was frankly a cynical attempt to cash in on someone else's success. Talking of which, when I brought the family to Oxford Street a fortnight ago every shop had Little Britain dolls piled up by the till. Apparently they puke and pee themselves. Well, I'd like the young gentlemen to know that Dave Podmore was providing that kind of entertainment while they were still having honey for tea at Eton and Harrow. If you don't believe me have a look at Tuffers Duffers, the new DVD featuring footage of your correspondent after lunch during a Bain Clarkson quarter-final at Nuneaton in 1982. As it says on the host's commentary - \"Dave Podmore there, putting it on every bleedin' spot at once\". Stick to dressing up as women, chaps - Podivation got there first."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
