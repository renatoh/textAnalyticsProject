Breton is sound. Breton is about audio and audio-visual autopsy; deconstructing and reassembling popular culture.\" Well, that's what they say. And what do you say? They're a five-piece band based in south London. But, it's fair to say, they are more than a five-piece band. Their base is The Lab, where all five live and work, making not just music but music videos, films and remixes. Veritable renaissance men, then? Well, we reserve that title for people who also design siege engines. But they're clearly no dolts, as the clip for their single Edward the Confessor makes plain \u2013 an arty black and white piece, made by Niall O'Brien and the band's multimedia arm, bretonLABS. With that name and a song called Edward the Confessor, they must be folkies. Far from it. Edward the Confessor chops up electronica, dirty bass, and what sounds like steel drums playing morse code. They come from the squat party scene, and leader Roman Pappak's tastes were formed by the cassettes he bought at pirate music kiosks in post-communist Poland. And they'v worked in Sigur R\u00f3s's studios in Iceland. Pappak's description of the results is: \"It's like someone threw a load of ketamine at you.\" Where can I hear them? There are several tracks scattered about Soundcloud. Edward the Confessor is available for download. Their debut album, Other People's Problems, is due next year on FatCat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
