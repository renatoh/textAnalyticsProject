Some of Australia\u2019s best-known companies could face hostile shareholder resolutions at their annual meetings in the spring as the battle over climate policy moves into the country\u2019s boardrooms. Westpac acknowledged on Thursday that it has a \u201cvariance\u201d in opinion with the Business Council of Australia over \u201cclimate and energy policy and advocacy\u201d. The bank, which is committed to action to achieve net zero emissions, did not spell out exactly what the variance entailed. It emphasised that it agreed with the BCA, which counts more than 100 of Australia\u2019s biggest companies as members, on support for the Paris agreement and a carbon price. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cWe respect that industry associations may hold different views \u2013 but where there is a difference we engage with the leadership,\u201d a Westpac spokesman said. \u201cWe have identified considerable alignment with the BCA, including their support for the Paris Agreement \u2013 however there is some variance around our respective positions on climate and energy policy and advocacy.\u201d But the BCA\u2019s advocacy for Kyoto carryover credits and extending the life of coal-fired power stations has led some activists to doubt that it can also support the Paris agreement to cut emissions, as its website states. It was also outspoken in its condemnation of Labor\u2019s policy to cut carbon emissions by 45%, calling the proposal \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d. Westpac was among several companies reviewing their membership of business associations in the light of divergent opinion about climate policy, along with BHP, Rio Tinto and Telstra, according to the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR). The BCA rejects claims that the stances are incompatible and says Kyoto carryover credits are not prohibited by the UN. A BCA spokesperson said: \u201cWe have long supported action to tackle climate change. That\u2019s why we support a realistic, pragmatic plan to manage the transition to a lower carbon economy which includes a market-based, economy-wide mechanism to reduce emissions, give businesses the ability to plan for the future, meet our Paris commitments and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\u201d But Australian companies could nevertheless face a series of shareholder revolts at this year\u2019s AGMs. The ACCR\u2019s Dan Gocher said Westpac had committed to carrying out a review after the ACCR threatened a shareholder resolution at the bank\u2019s AGM last year. The lobbying effort included \u201cidentifying to Westpac\u201d that the BCA\u2019s interventions in discussion of climate policy appeared to contravene the bank\u2019s own position. \u201cIt would have looked a little silly if Westpac said they were in complete alignment with the BCA,\u201d he said. \u201cBy not identifying the \u2018variances\u2019, it lets the BCA off the hook, so to speak. Investors are increasingly focusing on lobbying, but their focus to date has been on resources companies.\u201d Gocher said the ACCR was meeting up to 20 large companies, including Coles, Woolworths and Qantas, to lobby them ahead of the AGM season. \u201cRunning up to the AGM season we are meeting companies, investors and trying to get them to understand these issues. If the company doesn\u2019t understand we consider filing a resolution at the AGM,\u201d he said. It follows a series of successful challenges by shareholder activists against the boards of large companies during last year\u2019s AGM season, notably Telstra, Tabcorp and Westpac. \u201cWe are trying to weaken the influence of groups such as the BCA, the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association and the Minerals Council of Australia. They have played a destructive role on climate for 20 years and have never been the subject of scrutiny.\u201d Emma Herd, the chief executive at the Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors around the world were looking for companies to be constructive participants in the discussion on climate change and in \u201cgetting effective policy in place\u201d. She said investors were increasingly voting on resolutions at AGMs and also pushing behind closed doors for more effective action. \u201cInvestors are less interested in statements on paper and more interested in how companies are going to align their strategy with the decarbonising economy,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
