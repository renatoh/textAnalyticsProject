Here, it's a rich Californian widower who says to Poppy (Emma Roberts), his endearing brat of a daughter, after her latest escapade: \"Thats the final straw, you're off to England.\" Her destination is the exclusive 200-year-old Abbey Mount School for Girls where headmistress Natasha Richardson presides over an eccentric staff of St Trinians rejects and mobiles are confiscated on arrival. You can probably fill in the gap between the petulant Poppy's attempt to get expelled and her leading the school lacrosse team to victory with a last-minute goal just as Dad makes a surprise visit. The first produced screenplay by writer Lucy Dahl, daughter of Roald Dahl and Patricia Neal, and the directorial debut of Nick Moore, whose editing credits include Notting Hill, The Full Monty and Love Actually, this is a surprisingly dispiriting film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
