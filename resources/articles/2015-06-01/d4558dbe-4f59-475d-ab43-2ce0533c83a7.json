Not for them the Skrillex spaceship, the Flying Lotus cuboid net or the Calvin Harris approach of marking every drop with several grand\u2019s worth of pyro and demanding \u201cput your hands in the air right now!\u201d like he\u2019s doing over a Barclays. No, they\u2019re of the pressing-boxes-in-the-dark school, eschewing Ronson\u2019s special-guest bonanzas for taped appearances from Noel Gallagher (Setting Sun), Q-Tip (Galvanize) and Kele Okereke (Believe), letting their monstrous beats provide the fireworks. At one point a gigantic clockwork robot is lowered from the heavens as if to mock the EDM wedge-pocketers and their ridiculous onstage toys. Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands also refuse to acknowledge that their cultural kudos isn\u2019t what it was. Once they were the indie-dance gatekeepers, a guest spot on one of their tracks considered a real mark of respect. Today they\u2019re still courting cult alternative names \u2013 St Vincent guests on the upcoming new album Born in the Echoes \u2013 but the tunes, though still impactful, have no such crossover clout. Instead, the Chemical Brothers\u2019 shtick has become increasingly terror-tronic: \u201cHelp me Lord, I found myself in some kind of hell!\u201d rants a lost soul on Golden Path, and the visuals are straight out of Insidious. On Elektrobank, an increasingly irate Gollum figure rants down the phone, presumably at a particularly aggravating customer services department, while psychedelic hippy wig-out I\u2019ll See You There features voodoo images of skeleton masks and a bizarre man-cow with two-foot fingernails. Though it\u2019s frustrating that they\u2019ve gone off their churchy show-stopper The Private Psychedelic Reel (on a good night, the best bit of the 90s) they can still hammer out enough hits in Hey Boy Hey Girl, Galvanize, Believe and Block Rockin\u2019 Beats to inspire a hefty nostalgic frug. Irrelevant? Maybe. Impressive? Undoubtedly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
