The last ball of Shoaib Akhtar's first spell for Durham was hooked by John Wood for six and then, when he was surprisingly promoted to No3 in their batting order, Wood had him out for a first-ball duck. Shoaib was so keen to bounce back from his NatWest Challenge disappointments with Pakistan that, according to Durham's coach Martyn Moxon, \"he would have played for us on Monday at Derby if the work permit had come through in time.\" The permit did arrive at 4pm yesterday by which time Shoaib, whose arrival had been greeted with good-humoured bows from his new team-mates, was already stretching in the sunshine. In the blue of the Dynamos rather than the more familiar green, and in a shirt with no name or number, he opened the attack from the Stretford End and bowled two tidy overs. However in his third Stuart Law launched him for a six and two fours over backward point, although Shoaib responded coolly by bowling the Queenslander off his pads. It was the hooked six by Wood, a former Durham seamer who is not renowned for his batting, which might have given Shoaib second thoughts about choosing to make his debut in this competition, leaving him with figures of one for 31 in his four overs. The pinch-hitting experiment proved even less successful as an attempted hook off the burly Wood lobbed to Gregor Maiden, one of two debutants in an inexperienced Lancashire team, at midwicket. However Shoaib's double failure hardly mattered, with neither side having any chance of reaching the semi-finals. At least he has shown willing, and he now has the chance of a four-day match against India A before starting out on the task for which he has been signed, helping Durham into the First Division of the Championship, beginning at Worcester next week. Durham duly slumped to a fourth consecutive Twenty20 defeat despite 61 in 43 balls from Phil Mustard, the 20-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman who has already earned wildly premature comparisons with Adam Gilchrist. Carl Hooper took the last four wickets and conceded only three off the last over to secure a consolation victory for Lancashire in front of a 5,162 crowd, their lowest in the Twenty20 Cup but still their third best of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
