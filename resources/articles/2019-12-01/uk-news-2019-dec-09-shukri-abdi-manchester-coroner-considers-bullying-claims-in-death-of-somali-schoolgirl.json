Shukri Abdi, a 12-year-old Somali refugee, was found drowned in the River Irwell in Bury, Lancashire, on 28 June. Four other children were with her at the river before her death. At a preliminary inquest hearing on Monday in Manchester, the senior coroner, Joanne Kearsley, said she would consider whether the four were medically fit to give evidence by video link about the events leading up to Shukri\u2019s death. Kearsley is also considering whether claims that Shukri was a victim of bullying and coercion by the other children will form part of the full inquest, which is scheduled to take place in February. She is due to make a ruling on the scope of the inquest in seven days\u2019 time. The children cannot be named and were referred to in court as child one, child two, child three and child four. One is in the care of social services and is involved in family court proceedings. Shukri came to the UK last year with her mother and siblings after they fled conflict in Somalia. Shukri was brought up in a refugee camp in Kenya and she and her family were brought to the UK as part of the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme. Only the most vulnerable individuals and families are accepted on to the scheme after vetting. Shukri\u2019s family\u2019s barrister, Ashley Underwood QC, referred to a previous alleged incident of bullying, highlighted by Shukri\u2019s mother, Zamzam Ture six months before she died, in which Ture said her daughter had been pushed on to the road by others. The coroner said concerns had been raised about whether the four children would be fit enough, from a health perspective, to give evidence in court. She described the children as \u201cproperly interested persons\u201d in the case. She said that if they did give evidence via video link all questions to them would need to be submitted to the court beforehand and put to them by her counsel, who would be with the children. Shukri\u2019s friends and relatives have repeatedly claimed she was badly bullied at her school in Bury. The school subsequently closed and a new school has opened on the site. Shukri\u2019s family has accused the school of failing to take the bullying complaints seriously. Shukri\u2019s family previously told the Guardian she had helped look after her four younger siblings, supported her mother and dreamed of becoming a doctor. An investigation has been launched by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into whether police had treated Shukri\u2019s family \u201cless favourably\u201d because of their ethnic background. The IOPC is looking into allegations that officers failed to conduct an effective investigation and prematurely concluded that Shukri\u2019s death was not suspicious. An IOPC spokesperson said: \u201cThe investigation has progressed well and is ongoing. Shukri Abdi\u2019s family has received regular updates about our work, and our thoughts remain with them and all those affected by what happened.\u201d Shukri\u2019s family\u2019s solicitor, Attiq Malik, of Liberty Law Solicitors, welcomed the coroner\u2019s comments in Monday\u2019s hearing. \u201cInitially we were concerned that this inquest was simply going to be a tick-box exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cThe inquest was previously due to take place on 6 December for just a few hours. Now the inquest is likely to take place over two days next year with many witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step forward in finding out the truth about what happened to Shukri. We are not concerned about blame \u2013 just about knowing what really happened.\u201d A Greater Manchester police spokesperson said: \u201cWe had officers and staff in attendance today. We will continue to support the coronial process moving forward.\u201d \u2022 This article was corrected on 9 December 2019.
