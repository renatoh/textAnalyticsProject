The company reassured him there was nothing to worry about. The wooden cladding had been treated so that it would take 30 minutes before a fire could take hold. \u201cWe understand that these news articles are highly alarming for all residents of new homes,\u201d the company responded. \u201cAnd I hope that the above statement has allayed any fears you may have over the safety and construction of your Bellway home.\u201d On Sunday the cladding at De Pass Gardens, part of the Barking Reach development, caught fire in 70 seconds and soon consumed the building. Andrew Boff, the chair of the planning committee on the London Assembly, who lives opposite and was on the scene to help rescue people, told the London Evening Standard there was \u201cno alarm and of course no sprinklers\u201d. Miraculously, nobody died. The very next day, at an event in parliament to commemorate the second anniversary of the Grenfell fire, in which 72 people died and a further 70 were injured, Willie Thompson, a former Grenfell resident, confronted the housing secretary, James Brokenshire. \u201cThere\u2019s another Grenfell in the post and it is going to land on your door. You guys are doing almost nothing. Does it take another Grenfell?\u201d Tragically, given this government\u2019s attitude to working people, wavering between the callous and the capricious, and a broader state of civic ennui, it might. The state\u2019s culpability in this regard is clear. As my colleague Robert Booth has reported, in the two years since the fire, the public inquiry into what happened at Grenfell has not reported (and will not until October); tens of thousands of people still live in blocks covered in the same highly flammable cladding; and despite Theresa May\u2019s promise that everyone would be rehoused within three weeks, 17 families remain in temporary accommodation, with one in a hotel. Nobody has been held accountable and police investigations into potential manslaughter and health and safety violations aren\u2019t expected until 2021. Natasha Elcock of Grenfell United has described the lack of progress as \u201cbeyond frustrating. Is it incompetence or is it indifference?\u201d she asked the Guardian. Two years on, it feels nigh impossible to parse the two. Indeed it seems like the latter makes the former possible. It is the government\u2019s indifference that makes it incompetent. It\u2019s not an issue of capacity. It could fix these things if it wanted to. But it doesn\u2019t care enough. In that sense, precious little has changed. From the outset Grenfell was a charred and gruesome monument to neglect. Not benign neglect \u2013 the absent-minded inattention of those who did not know, failed to prioritise or were engaged elsewhere \u2013 but malign: the knowing and wilful lack of interest of a political, rentier and media class that were aware of the issues but unmoved until tragedy forced them to respond. That was true in an immediate sense. The tenants had warned the landlord of the potential for disaster and the landlord had ignored them, most blatantly in the grimly lucid warning, seven months before the fire, from the tenants\u2019 organisation, Grenfell Action Group: \u201c[We] have reached the conclusion that only an incident that results in serious loss of life \u2026 will allow the external scrutiny to occur that will shine a light on \u2026 the malign governance of this non-functioning organisation.\u201d But it was also true in a broader metaphorical sense. The protective cladding \u2013 lethal to those who lived in it, decorative to the mostly wealthy neighbours who had to look at it \u2013 said it all. This is the country we now live in. This fatal blaze in the heart of Britain\u2019s wealthiest borough signalled the brazen arrival of the four horsemen of late-stage capitalism: inequality, austerity, deregulation and privatisation. All illusions about where that toxic blend of policies and trajectories might lead went up in flames that night. With austerity causing an estimated 130,000 preventable deaths since 2012, putting profit before people is a principle some are willing to champion to death. But politicians are rarely directly confronted with the human cost of their ideology on such a scale. When they are, they are likely to gag like a meat-eater in an abattoir. May\u2019s refusal to meet survivors in the days immediately following the fire was emblematic of her inability to engage, empathise or relate. There\u2019s an obscenity to the Tory leadership race, in which candidates parade their tax-cutting credentials when the need for more social housing, safety inspectors and housing officers is so painfully evident. But to blame this entirely on the government and Conservatives would be too easy. The Grenfell fire took place less than a week after the last election, and in the last seat to declare a result \u2013 a shocking 20-vote victory to Labour in a seat no one imagined it had a chance in at the outset. Labour had campaigned against austerity; the Tories had lost their majority. Put bluntly, there was significant public pressure that went beyond those directly affected. Part of the reason the government has managed to backslide is because that pressure was not sustained. Grenfell is not alone in this regard. The same thing has happened with Windrush \u2013 which pricked the national conscience for a few weeks and then receded from the conversation. But just because people stop talking about an injustice doesn\u2019t make the injustice disappear \u2013 indeed, it\u2019s precisely because they stop talking about it that it\u2019s liable to persist. Within a year of the scandal breaking, Amber Rudd was back in the cabinet and the government had resumed the deportations of people who had every right to be here. Meanwhile, only 13 people have been given any assistance from the hardship fund set up to help Windrush victims struggling with destitution since they were illegally and improperly stripped of their citizenship. That\u2019s just one more person than the number who were wrongly deported and then died before the government could even apologise. Just last week Glyn Williams, the architect of the \u201chostile environment\u201d policy that made the Windrush scandal possible, was made knight commander of the order of Bath in the honours list. The nation\u2019s capacity for indignation is apparently rivalled only by its propensity for distraction. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t see injustice or cannot comprehend it. It\u2019s that we apparently get bored by it. We are becoming very careless with our innocence: we keep losing it, only to find it again in time to be \u201cshocked\u201d by the next outrage. Grenfell was not only predictable, it was predicted. It did not \u201ctake\u201d that tragedy to teach us what happens when negligent landlords and shoddy builders come together in an age of cost-cutting and regulatory ambivalence. We already knew. But it has raised the question whether we, as a society, cared enough to do anything about it. So long as a similar tragedy could happen tomorrow, the answer is a shameful no. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
