Gary Neville, fearing a rout after the opening exchanges, can start his tenure on a high after Santi Mina, brilliantly assisted by Paco Alc\u00e1cer, equalised with minutes to go. Credit for tonight belongs to Valencia\u2019s patchwork team, well drilled by Voro and Phil Neville, who sat back and soaked up pressure, even at 1-0 down, hoping for a chance. When it came, they took it. As David Moyes has just said, \u201cyou\u2019re always in it at only a goal down.\u201d It looks like the Nevilles\u2019 English influence is rubbing off on Valencia already. Thanks for joining me. Bye! Full time, and improbably enough, the spoils are shared, with Santi Mina dramatically cancelling out Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s opener just before the hour. 92 mins: Barcelona, desperate to atone for all those missed chances, pour forward, with Alba forcing a corner as Santos cuts out his cross. Piqu\u00e9 is penalised for a shove, and time is almost up. 90 mins: Tropi is on for goalscorer Mina. Su\u00e1rez skips away from Abdennour, and passes sideways to Messi, but his shot from twenty yards is scooped up by Domenech. Three added minutes. 89 mins: Danilo fires a shot at Bravo as the visitors fail to clear, and the Chilean comes close to spilling it over his own line. Neville watch: Un-bee-lieee-vable. 88 mins: Messi fires a free kick that Domenech claws away from under his crossbar, but Valencia have their tails up, and charge downfield once again. It\u2019s three on three, and Piatti feeds the ball to Bakkali, but it\u2019s slightly behind him, and Bakkali\u2019s awkward cross is punched clear by Bravo. From out of nowhere, a hopeful long ball lands on Alc\u00e1cer\u2019s chest. The No9 has fed on scraps all evening, but holds off Piqu\u00e9 and Mascherano, waits patiently, then slots the ball to his right. Mina is onto it, and smacks it beyond Bravo. The Mestalla erupts! 84 mins: Alc\u00e1cer spins into two tussles for the ball, with Piqu\u00e9 and then Alves, and emerges clutching his ankle. No foul given, though. Barcelona work upfield and earn a corner, and Valencia break... 82 mins: Pablo Piatti is on in place of the tireless de Paul. Still no changes from Luis Enrique. 80 mins: Bakkali takes Pique on from the left-hand edge of the area, then attempts a snap shot which balloons inelegantly over the bar. Valencia stepping it up with ten minutes to go. 78 mins: The best chance of the match for Valencia, as Busquets gives the ball away, and de Paul skips past Piqu\u00e9\u2019s lunge. He has Bakkali in space to his left, but tries an awkward low shot that Bravo saves and holds. Neville watch: puffing out his cheeks. 76 mins: Danilo picks up a booking after forcing Messi to the floor. Barcelona with a free kick 25 yards out, just right of centre. The ball ricochets through to Rakitic, but he\u2019s flagged offside. Incorrectly. 74 mins: Neymar delivers his party piece, cutting in past Vezo on the left, thirty yards out, and slaloming through the defence, before firing a shot towards Domenech\u2019s top corner. To widespread surprise, he misses. 72 mins: Bakkali, a summer arrival from PSV, is on in place of Enzo P\u00e9rez. Time ticking away, and the Mestalla is as quiet as it\u2019s been all evening. 70 mins: Su\u00e1rez, who has been front and centre in the second half, drawing a clumsy foul from Dani Parejo. He\u2019s booked, and will miss Gary Neville\u2019s first league game in charge at Eibar. Gay\u00e0 also draws the ire of the referee, diving pitifully after edging past his man. On Su\u00e1rez, JR in Illinois is unequivocal. \u201cHe is just diabolical. No way should he still be on the pitch. I don\u2019t understand how anyone can respect him with the way he conducts himself.\u201d It wasn\u2019t great \u2013 similar to the incident that saw Gabriel sent off against Chelsea. Gabriel, unlike Su\u00e1rez, was at least a little wound up. 68 mins: Not a great deal going on, with de Paul and Mina trying to make something happen, but being stymied by a lack of support. Messi has a sniff of goal, but his shot is blocked, and Su\u00e1rez gives away a free kick after renewing acquaintances with Abdennour. 65 mins: Barcelona are up to 73% possession. Whatever the circumstances, supporters of a club the size of Valencia won\u2019t ever relish being dominated to that extent. Neville watch: Phil is in conversation with Voro; Gary is sending for the big Sky touchscreen. 62 mins: Replays suggest that Su\u00e1rez was a fraction offside as Messi twirled and played the ball through. There wasn\u2019t an awful lot in it. 60 mins: Valencia push forward in response, and after Dani Parejo sees his half-volley blocked, de Paul beats the sluggish Alba to the rebound. The two players tangle, with Valencia screaming for a penalty \u2013 but that would have been extremely soft. Messi swivels and flicks the ball down the right channel, and Su\u00e1rez is into another battle with Abdennour. He wins it comfortably, and from a tight angle, he lashes the ball inside the near post. 55 mins: A quiet start to the second half, with Barcelona struggling to match their first half intensity. Abdennour is pointing at Su\u00e1rez, then to a mark on his arm. Something that happened in that earlier tangle, but not... you know. 53 mins: Su\u00e1rez is coming to the boil on a frustrating evening, the forward clattering Domenech after an outrageous no-look back flick from Alves sets up a Barcelona attack. No booking, but a talking to from the referee. 52 mins: de Paul picks out Alc\u00e1cer with a nicely weighted long pass, and charges upfield for a long-range one-two, but panic sets in and Alc\u00e1cer surrenders possession. 50 mins: Abdennour is furious with Su\u00e1rez after an innocuous looking tangle outside the Valencia box. Replays show the striker planting a foot on Abdennour\u2019s instep. He was lucky neither referee nor assistant spotted that. 48 mins: Valencia, who are missing Gomes, Fuego, Feghouli, Cancelo, Mustafi, Negredo and Barragan, among others, are still gamely pressing Barcelona all over the pitch. They can\u2019t get the ball, but the crowd appreciate their enthusiasm. Within the first minute, Neymar holds off three defenders and backheels to Su\u00e1rez, but the striker is a yard offside. Your half-time thoughts \u201cAs absolutely fantastic as Barcelona\u2019s attacking trident is, they miss Xavi when the other team sits deep\u201d suggests K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThough I personally think Iniesta is a more imaginative player, having a double pivot of creativity lurking outside the 18-yard box made them harder to predict, and therefore much more difficult for their opponents to defend against all angles of attack.\u201d I think that\u2019s Ivan Rakitic\u2019s job these days, but he\u2019s been the least productive of Barcelona\u2019s front five so far. He always is when I watch them, but I hear he\u2019s half-decent sometimes. Garry Bacon has this: He won eight titles, five domestic cups and the Champions League at Manchester United, but it was pretty good, wasn\u2019t it? The visitors are dominant, but have lacked their usual cutting edge. Valencia hanging on at half time, but in theory at least, it\u2019s all to play for. Back in a few. 45 mins: Abdennour catches Su\u00e1rez in the back, conceding a free kick as the Uruguayan clutches his... head. From it, Barcelona switch off, and a tentative Valencia break forces Mascherano into an awkward back pass. Bravo hoofs it clear, and that\u2019s half time. 43 mins: 64% possession, but just one shot on target for Barcelona. I make it two, but who am I to argue. The visitors easing off the gas a little, with half time approaching. 42 mins: Rakitic rakes a long pass towards Iniesta, but it\u2019s badly overhit. Neville watch: starting to fidget. 40 mins: From their own goal kicks, Valencia are walking out in two rows, five yards apart. Messi stays ten yards behind them, minding his own business. It reminds me of this: 38 mins: Iniesta lifts the ball over the Valencia back line to Alba, who squares the ball to Su\u00e1rez \u2013 but Santos is on hand to prod the ball off his boot and behind. Barcelona should be at least 3-0 up. 36 mins: From a corner, Rakitic pelts a shot at Domenech, before the rebound is deflected away. Barcelona not so much knocking on the door as taking a battering ram to it; Valencia are still just about holding on. 34 mins: They\u2019re at it again \u2013 Barcelona break at speed, Messi slotting through to Su\u00e1rez, who skips impetuously over Abdennour. He can shoot, or cross to the waiting Neymar, but does neither, wafting the ball over the Brazilian\u2019s head. 33 mins: It\u2019s been a while, but Messi, Neymar and Su\u00e1rez link up beautifully here. Messi prods the ball left to Neymar, who shapes to shoot, then balloons an improbable pass to Su\u00e1rez, six yards out to the right of goal. The Uruguayan can\u2019t finish though, blazing over the crossbar. 31 mins: Alc\u00e1cer leads a charge upfield and hooks a cross towards P\u00e9rez, who tussles with Piqu\u00e9 before hurling himself to the floor. Latre isn\u2019t interested. Neville watch: an almost imperceptible shake of the head. 29 mins: De Paul and Gay\u00e0 link up down the left, with the latter firing a hopeful cross towards Paco Alc\u00e1cer which Bravo claims comfortably. 28 mins: Mina is again quickest to a 50/50 ball, drawing a high boot from Iniesta. A chance for Valencia to venture out of their own half, but the nerves are showing, with a couple of hopeful hoofs before the move runs out. Iniesta shows them how it\u2019s done, pinging a heatseeker of a through ball to Su\u00e1rez, who can\u2019t reel it in under pressure. 25 mins: Barcelona work a short corner, and as it\u2019s cleared, eight white shirts stroll out in a straight line. Organised, but rigid, and Neymar exploits the space before showing Vezo up at the byline. He slots the ball to Messi, who fires at Domenech from six yards, and howls in frustration. 23 mins: Valencia, who are missing several players with injury, are continuing to frustrate Barcelona, with Busquets drilling a low shot well wide of Domenech\u2019s far post. 21 mins: Neymar wriggles free on the left, but his firm cross only finds a white shirt. Iniesta is next to fire in a left-wing cross, with the ball striking Vezo\u2019s forearm, down by his side. A few half-hearted appeals. Barcelona pressing again, but Valencia have upped their defensive game, and Rakitic gives away a cheap foul to ease the pressure. 19 mins: 19-year-old midfielder Danilo gives Busquets the eyes, before outfoxing him with a shimmy that delights the Mestalla. He won\u2019t like that. 17 mins: As soon as Valencia throw a couple of bodies forward, Barcelona can pounce, with Mascherano finding Su\u00e1rez down the left. He slots the ball to Messi, but his backheeled return pass is hacked away. Seamless rotation from the front three; you wonder how many other players Barcelona actually need out there. 16 mins: A little livelier from the hosts, with Alc\u00e1cer finding space from the free kick \u2013 but the lone striker can\u2019t find a team-mate. 14 mins: Quick thinking from Santi Mina, who sprints to poke the ball beyond Mascherano and lets physics do the rest. It\u2019s a clear obstruction, and Mascherano is booked. Neymar, clipped on the heel moments before, comes back into his own half to harangue the referee. 12 mins: Dani Alves is flagged offside, despite being level with both the assistant and the last defender. Valencia were about to be carved open, there. Neville watch: still impassive in the stands. 11 mins: Neymar has had his fun with Vezo, and lets Messi have a run at the labouring right back. The No10 dances around his marker and toe pokes a cross into the six yard box, but it\u2019s scrambled clear. 9 mins: A first half-chance for Valencia, as Rodrigo de Paul flashes a shot well wide of Bravo\u2019s left-hand post. The respite is temporary, with Barcelona back in home territory in no time. 8 mins: With Valencia camped in the middle of the field, Mascherano looks for Messi with another raking diagonal ball, but it\u2019s overhit. 6 mins: Valencia will need to tighten up, and quickly; Neymar and Su\u00e1rez exchange passes, with Vezo giving the Brazilian a free run on goal, but he blasts over the bar. For someone who scores so often, he can be wildly inaccurate. 5 mins: Barcelona\u2019s attacking trident shimmers for the first time, with Messi sweeping the ball wide to Neymar on the left. With Luis Su\u00e1rez drawing the central defenders, Messi races in to volley just beyond the top corner. 3 mins: A rough-and-tumble start from Valencia, barging Messi off the ball before Enzo P\u00e9rez scurries up the left flank, before being crowded out. 2 mins: Valencia, in white shirts and black shorts, are playing in a 4-5-1, with nominal wingers Mina and De Paul sitting deep in midfield. Barcelona are in yellow with red stripes (just on the back), a shirt much more similar to Valencia\u2019s white than their home one. 1 min: Barcelona stroke it around midfield, to a chorus of whistles from the crowd, before pinging a diagonal pass that\u2019s out of Jordi Alba\u2019s reach. Referee Santiago Jaime Latre blows his whistle, and Barcelona get the ball rolling. The players are in the tunnel, with kick-off imminent at a bouncing Mestalla. Predictions? John McEnerney fancies a score draw. I\u2019ll say a narrow defeat for the hosts. Either would be bearable for the new head coach. Full-time at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea 0-1 Bournemouth. Mercy, mercy me. Neville watch: The new Valencia head coach is at the Mestalla, watching alongside club chairman Lay Hoon Chan. He\u2019s not in charge of the team tonight though; I can\u2019t stress that enough. On Sky, David Moyes is chatting about Gary Neville: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see a British coach involved in one of Europe\u2019s top leagues\u201d, says Moyes, not at all bitter. \u201cYou have to embrace the culture, but Gary will be fine with that. The most important thing is winning games\u201d he adds, with a rueful smile. Psst... it\u2019s Chelsea 0-1 Bournemouth. Go and see Lawrence Ostlere, but be sure to come back. Atl\u00e9tico have won 2-0 at Granada, Diego God\u00edn and Antoine Griezmann with the goals. They stay second, just a point behind Barcelona. Feels like it should be more than that. Valencia: Domenech; R\u00faben Vezo, Santos, Abdennour, Gay\u00e0; Danilo, Enzo P\u00e9rez, Dani Parejo; Mina, de Paul, Alc\u00e1cer. Subs: Ryan, Diallo, Tropi, Bakkali, Piatti, Nacho Gil, Villalba.

Barcelona team news Barcelona, who don\u2019t go in for fancy pre-match graphics, have announced their team. Substitutes for both sides to follow shortly. Valencia team news Salvador \u2018Voro\u2019 Gonz\u00e1lez, Valencia\u2019s club delegate, is in charge of first-team business tonight, assisted by Phil Neville. Here\u2019s the team he\u2019s selected, with just two enforced changes from the loss at Sevilla. Rodrigo de Paul and R\u00faben Vezo replace Javi Fuego and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, both suspended after picking up red cards in the defeat that did for former boss Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo. The Valencia team bus has arrived at the Mestalla to a raucous reception. Required reading While we wait, get stuck into some quality content. First, Sid Lowe on the challenge awaiting Gary Neville; next, Matthew Taylor calls Neville a \u2018confrontational runt\u2019, but brings it back, in the Guardian profile. Let\u2019s not forget about Barcelona: here\u2019s Barney Ronay on their carefree front three. Valencia v Barcelona is one of Spain\u2019s most historic, high-profile fixtures, but the build up, on British shores at least, has centred on a man who will be watching from the stands. Depending on who you ask, Gary Neville\u2019s shock appointment as Valencia head coach is either a cushy short-term gig at an unfeasibly elite European side, or an icy plunge into the deep end at a club divided from the boardroom down. Neville may have checked the fixtures and decided to sit this one out, thanks, but tonight\u2019s result could still rewrite his to-do list. Valencia are a talented team who have underperformed without due cause all season, with a hard-earned Champions League campaign now hinging on a final group game against Lyon \u2013 Neville\u2019s first in charge. Yet they remain just five points off unlikely top four residents Celta Vigo in the La Liga table, and could give the Neville/Neville era an early shot in the arm with a landmark victory tonight. There\u2019s just one problem: they\u2019re playing Barcelona, who since losing to Sevilla two months ago have gone unbeaten, outscoring their opponents by 38 goals to five, humiliating illustrious names like Real Madrid and Roma along the way. Defeat to this team, who are scampering into the distance in the title race thanks to an absurdly potent front three, would be no disgrace \u2013 but tonight\u2019s visitors could pour fresh salt into the wounds Neville has been hired to heal. Kick off is at 7.30pm GMT, so kick off your shoes and relax your socks. Whatever happens, it\u2019s likely to be entertaining. Hello. Niall will be here shortly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
