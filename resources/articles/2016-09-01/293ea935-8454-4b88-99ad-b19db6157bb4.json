Skrtel, who left Liverpool for Fenerbahce this summer, was dismissed for two bookable offences after fouls on Harry Kane. The first yellow had been awarded after the centre-back\u2019s left elbow caught the striker in the face, apparently unintentionally, midway through the first half. The second was for a stamp on Kane\u2019s ankle, despite Skrtel having won the ball, leaving Slovakia to play the last 33 minutes with 10 men. Durica, who bemoaned the concession of a \u201ccheap\u201d goal in stoppage time to Adam Lallana, claimed the red card decision by the Serbian referee, Milorad Mazic, was \u201creally strict\u201d before lurching into his conspiracy theory. \u201cI think that the referee was waiting for Skrtel to commit a foul,\u201d said the Trabzonspor defender. \u201cThere is only one place [up for grabs] at the World Cup. Why should Slovakia go there, when we have England in the group? Of course they will always prefer the stronger team. Probably the referee exactly knew how to do it.\u201d Mazic had approached the touchline to speak to the Slovakia manager, Jan Kozak, during the first half after the coach had made clear his dissatisfaction that Gary Cahill had escaped sanction for a foul on Jan Gregus shortly after Skrtel\u2019s first caution. As it was, the home side\u2019s centre-half had arguably been fortunate not to accrue a second booking two minutes before the break after bringing down Kane in a tussle on the run. Kozak would not comment on the incidents. Kane, who departed Trnava confident there was no lasting damage sustained to his ankle, had anticipated Skrtel was risking a second caution after a series of challenges in an occasionally bad-tempered game. \u201cThere were a few challenges that I felt could have earned him a yellow card but it didn\u2019t come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a matter of time. It was a silly thing for him to do because he was on a yellow. The ref has seen it and I think it deserved another yellow card.\u201d Those sentiments were echoed by John Stones, who felt Skrtel might have been punished sooner than the 57th minute. \u201cThose are all factors that are out of our hands,\u201d said the Manchester City defender. \u201cWe can only appeal to the referee and see what decision he makes but Skrtel committed a few fouls that could have changed the game earlier.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
