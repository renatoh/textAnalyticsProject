Doing Money follows Ana, a twentysomething Romanian woman living in London and working as a cleaner while she studies to be a nurse, over the course of the year after she is snatched off the street by a gang of eastern-European sex traffickers. It is breathtaking how quickly and easily it is done. They threaten to harm Ana\u2019s family \u2013 they know her mother\u2019s name and address \u2013 if she screams or tries to escape. She is taken to Ireland and stripped of her passport, glasses and phone before being forced to \u201cdo money\u201d in a series of brothels (doors locked, windows nailed shut) across the country. \u201cNobody knows where I am,\u201d she says in a voiceover. \u201cNot even me.\u201d At least until her first client arrives. \u201cWelcome to Galway,\u201d he says as he unbuckles his belt. He\u2019s not sinister. He\u2019s an ordinary man who has paid his money. Ana fights him off. \u201cShe\u2019s mad!\u201d he shouts in outrage. \u201cFine way to treat an honest customer.\u201d The man who snatched her off the street rapes her instead. His female partner-in-crime tells Ana that there will be no food unless she works. And so she works. The pimps charge extra for anal sex, sex without a condom and for special services, such as those for the men who want to beat up Ana in addition to raping her. Interwoven with this unflinching portrayal of the brutality she suffers at the hands of her pimps and of ordinary men \u2013 there is a spike in business on Thursday evenings because it is when wives go late-night shopping \u2013 is the story of the police investigating and trying to prosecute those responsible. In one raid, the chance of rescue seems possible, but all the police find is evidence of a tenancy agreement and client lists in her name. Ana now has a criminal record and returns to her pimps even more vulnerable, effectively shackled to them. A second raid is more carefully planned by a team experienced in the field of tracking and trying to prosecute modern slavers and endlessly frustrated by their lack of power. You can\u2019t remove an adult woman from her situation without her consent and the abused women they meet are too terrified to give it. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d mutters the youngest of Ana\u2019s fellow captives (delivered to the gang the day after her 18th birthday by a boyfriend who told her he was bringing her in for webcam work) as the police question their status in front of their pimp. \u201cI\u2019m free.\u201d The sketching of the police investigation and the difficulties they face is possibly done too lightly in a film that is clearly intended as agitprop. The investigators need to be more than ciphers and the law\u2019s inadequacies and otiose requirements need to be hammered home at least as hard as the horrors the women suffer, because we are unlikely to feel the same emotional response to the former as we do to the latter. That emotional response also allows the viewer to skim over an underpowered script and some narrative solutions that seem rather too neat to be true, even if \u2013 such is the weird way storytelling on screen works \u2013 they are. Take, for example, the local gangster who turns out to have a heart of gold and the relative ease with which Ana decides to testify against those who held her. Vitally, however, neither of these flaws is great enough to detract from the power of and the suffering in Ana\u2019s story. Her experience is representative of the 5 million women and girls who, we are told in a caption at the end, endured such sexual exploitation last year. The real Ana\u2019s testimony in parliament in Belfast helped secure the passing of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act \u2013 the first new law against slavery in the UK for nearly 200 years. I don\u2019t like to think what this says about how far we have come in the intervening years. But one thing I like to think about even less is that, among all the women watching this programme and thinking: \u201cThere but for the grace of God,\u201d and all the men watching aghast at this awful underbelly of the world, there will be a tiny fraction who look at the pimps or the rapists they facilitate and think: \u201cThere\u2019s an idea \u2026\u201d And so the world turns.
