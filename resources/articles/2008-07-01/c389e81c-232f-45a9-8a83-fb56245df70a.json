He played the woodcutter in Rashomon, leader of the Seven Samurai and in Ikiru he's a crabbed, middle-aged civil servant suddenly faced with his imminent death by cancer. He goes through the usual stages of denial and despair, taking to drink, regretting his miserable life, before embarking on a minor scheme to turn a waste lot into a neighbourhood park for underprivileged children. The narrative is carefully paced, the central performance magnificent, the final effect overwhelming in a manner that recalls the great Russian writers Kurosawa admired."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
