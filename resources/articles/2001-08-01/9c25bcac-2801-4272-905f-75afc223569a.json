Plans to simplify the process do not go far enough and bosses will still face an administrative nightmare, the Confederation of British Industry warned. The CBI director general, Digby Jones, said: \"The government seems determined to deliver to parents but is less willing to deliver for business, the job creators in our society.\" In its green paper on working parents, the government made a number of proposals aimed at making it easier for employers to plan for absence. Ministers proposed scrapping a rule which allows employers to contact new mothers three weeks before the end of their maternity leave to check the date they will return to work. Mr Jones said: \"Businesses, especially smaller ones, need to plan ahead. It is a fact of life that many people tell employers they plan to return to work just to keep their options open. Is it really unreasonable for a firm to clarify an employee's intentions before the return date? Women should not be contacted unnecessarily, but some communication can benefit employers and employees.\" New mothers may give three weeks' notice of returning to their jobs and the government proposes extending this by a week, but the CBI believe employers should be given at least six weeks' notice. The CBI also rejected a proposal that employers must inform women of their individual rights within a week of hearing of their pregnancy. The proposal is \"simply unachievable\" and firms would need at least three weeks to confirm details of entitlements, it said. The CBI also wants the government to pay the full cost of administering the two-week paternity pay that comes in from 2003. Unison, which represents public sector workers, accused the CBI of being \"petty\" in its objections. Women's officer Marisa Howes said: \"It's a shame that the CBI still sees it as a battle between business and parents. The objections they are raising seem very petty when so many employers still subject pregnant women to harassment and dismissal.\" The equal opportunities commission said it supported the government's proposals and that new regulations would not be damaging to employers. It declared: \"The EOC believes that the government's proposals on the administration of the new maternity regulations have struck a reasonable balance between the needs of parents and the needs of business. Business does not exist in a vacuum - it is made up to a significant extent of people who will benefit from the new regulations at some point, and so business itself will also benefit.\" Related articles 12.07.01: Men behaving badly 09.07.01: Firms face audit on gender imbalance 03.04.01: Why boys are not the new girls 28.03.01: Campaigners want tougher equal pay action Useful links Confederation of British Industry New maternity rules: 10 Downing Street"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
