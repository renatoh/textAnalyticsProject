Both clubs have agreed a \u00a31.75m fee with Blackburn, rising to \u00a32m on appearances, as well as personal terms with the player, who is currently talking with his family before deciding on his next move. But Taylor believes Dailly's links with the east midlands - he left Derby for Blackburn in a \u00a35.3m deal in 1998 - will tip things in the Leicester's favour. Dailly is also friends with Leicester pair Gary Rowett and Callum Davidson, his Scotland room-mate. Taylor said: \"I know Christian has spoken to West Ham but I am quietly confident he will come here. He knows the area and knows one or two of our players. They've all said what a good pro he is. \"I need another central defender and he fits the bill. He is very experienced. I know he can play in midfield but I see him as a defender here.\" Should Dailly opt for Leicester then a medical is likely to take place tomorrow. Leicester play Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday and Taylor said: \"I would love him to be in the frame for that match.\" The news comes as a blow to West Ham who, according to Harry Redknapp thought they had Dailly's signature \"in the bag\". But Hammers MD Paul Aldridge said today: \"We are still confident that he will join us even though he has spoken to Leicester.\" Dailly this afternoon confirmed that he is yet to make up his mind over a move: \"It's sometimes difficult to be patient in football because people want things done in 10 seconds ... but that's not my style: I like to take my time, and it's not as if I've asked for a move.\" \"I went to talk to West Ham and have a look around, and everyone I spoke to impressed me\", he told the West Ham website. \"But it's the whole thing I've got to think about, because I've got kids who are settled at school.\" Dailly has made just 12 appearances for the first team this season and is not part of Graeme Souness' long-term plans at Ewood Park. \u0095 Steve Lomas has decided to stay at West Ham after talks with Manchester City and Everton about a \u00a33.7m move; and Paolo di Canio has reiterated his desire to remain at Upton Park despite renewed speculation linking him with Lazio. West Ham's manager Harry Redknapp, who has also had talks with Rangers' Lorenzo Amoruso, is said to be pursuing yet another defender. Pascal Cygan of Lille said he had been approached by both the London club and Lyon, and that West Ham officials would watch him in a French First Division match at Troyes on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
