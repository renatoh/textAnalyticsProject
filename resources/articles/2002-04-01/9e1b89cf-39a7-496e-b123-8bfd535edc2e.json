England, insists their manager, have no chance of winning next year's World Cup unless they can rediscover their sharpness, rid the squad of fading underachievers and persuade the leading clubs to increase their support for the national cause. Woodward has made it crystal clear he needs more coaching time with his players and, starting with this summer's tour to Argentina, he intends to question every aspect of England's structure, right down to Jonny Wilkinson's role at fly-half. France's deserved grand slam has clearly stung the management into deep self-analysis. \"We are very disappointed to finish second, that's my verdict,\" said Woodward, adamant that the Lions tour last summer had been a major reason behind England's developmental slowdown. \"We're not close to the level we played at last year and it is the level of performance which is the most worrying aspect. We seem to be missing a spark and a freshness and that's showing. We've also had just one proper training session outside the normal build-up to Test matches in the last 12 months. It all stacks up and in the end it's the reason for what happened in Paris.\" The solution, in his view, lies in improving the ever-delicate relationship between the Rugby Football Union and the top clubs. \"This partnership in England has had some teething problems, but now it's time to deliver because we can't win a World Cup if we leave it until the last couple of months before the tournament to do the important work. We can't compete without extra time together. I'm not blaming anybody but there's some serious money now being paid by the RFU. One training session in 12 months is not enough. What we want to achieve is relatively straightforward. We just need more coaching time.\" It helps explain Woodward's determination to tour this summer with as many leading players as he can - \"the French grand slam was set up by their tour of South Africa last year, simple as that\" - but if certain individuals are quietly pacing themselves in advance of the World Cup they are in for a shock. \"If we are brutally honest, when we play southern hemisphere teams at home they are out of season,\" added Woodward, unimpressed by the world No1 computer ranking his side briefly held last month. Having already stuck Martin Johnson, Austin Healey and others on the bench, his latest idea to promote a more dynamic forward platform is to experiment with the Gloucester prop Trevor Woodman as a hooker in Argentina. \"In business you expect to lose 10% of your people in a year, and some players have dropped off. I would like a settled starting 15 by the next Six Nations championship as part of the World Cup preparations. France are the best team in Europe and we've got to tuck ourselves back into the slipstream behind them.\" Even Wilkinson, England's record points scorer, will find himself under scrutiny, with Woodward suggesting he wants to have a look at Sale's Charlie Hodgson in a big game later this year. \"Jonny is still the main man but we have to look at Charlie. He could be better than Jonny but we have to see him play.\" It may sound strange but Woodward claims Wilkinson's bravery - he topped England's tackle count against Italy with 10 - counts against him. \"Against France he was at the bottom of too many rucks when he should have been directing operations.\" With Lawrence Dallaglio confirmed as England's tour captain this summer - \"he's an outstanding captain who has had some difficulties but I don't see any reason why he shouldn't captain the team\" - Woodward also plans within the next fortnight to discuss the future of his assistant Brian Ashton, absent in recent weeks for personal reasons. Even the enlightened Ashton, it seems, is not irreplaceable. \"If Brian doesn't come back no one else will come in. I've enjoyed working with the backs,\" said Woodward. A glance at England's potential 15 Tests over the next 18 months suggests Woodward is going to need all the help he can get. France even loom as his side's opening opponents in next year's Six Nations, although the BBC, assuming it wins the new contract, is keen to shift that game to a later date. Between now and then, however, England will not be allowed to stand still. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
