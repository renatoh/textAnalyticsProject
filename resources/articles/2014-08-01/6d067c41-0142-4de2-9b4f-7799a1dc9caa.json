That mystery worked in Ferguson\u2019s favor, as the comedian took advantage of his initially small audience to incorporate far more bizarre jokes and segments than are typically encouraged in US late-night television. Time will tell if Corden can use these things to his advantage, until then, here\u2019s a brief introduction to the actor for American audiences who may be unfamiliar with him. The show that made him famous is Gavin and Stacey: Corden made his name on the beloved British series Gavin and Stacey, where he played Smithy. Following the success of Gavin and Stacey, he went on to create a sketch show with Gavin and Stacey costar Mathew Horne called Horne &amp; Corden. He later said the maligned show was a mistake. \u201cI\u2019m not good enough at writing sketches to write a sketch show,\u201d Corden said in March 2010. He began to gain some renown for The History Boys: The heartwarming play, about a beloved history teacher who comes out as gay and is supported by his students, premiered at the National Theatre in London in 2004, went to Broadway in 2006 and was later made into a film. Corden starred as Timms in the original production, on Broadway and in the film. If you\u2019re an American, you are more likely to know him from Broadway: His biggest US success was seen in his heralded performance in One Man, Two Guvnors, where he won a Tony for his starring role as Francis Henshall. And because he\u2019s starring in Disney\u2019s Into the Woods: Corden stars as the Baker in Disney\u2019s feature film Into the Woods. The much-anticipated film is set for release on Christmas, with a cast that includes Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick. Even without the Late Late Night hosting gig, this role would surely made Corden a known name in the States. And there\u2019s a chance you saw some of his World Cup videos: One of Corden\u2019s more global, notable gigs is hobnobbing with football stars ahead of the 2010 World Cup. He fished with England\u2019s John Terry and golfed with Steven Gerrard, where he learned that Gerrard\u2019s favorite X Factor contestant (at the time!) was Leona Lewis. He is friends with Harry Styles and Anna Wintour: He explained how that came to be in a September interview with the Guardian: \u201cWell I\u2019ll tell you how. So Louis Tomlinson, who is a member of One Direction, his mum was a chaperone on Fat Friends. So Louis used to come to the set with his mum and since I was the only sort of young person around we would kick a football around, things like that. Then when he got into the X Factor, he got in touch and said, \u2018I\u2019m in London and I don\u2019t know anybody.\u2019 \u201cSo he brought Harry round and we played Fifa and had a pizza, so that\u2019s how. He\u2019s an adorable guy and I can\u2019t begin to imagine what his life is like right now and how it\u2019s changed in the past three years. And I feel like the more normal people he has around, probably the better.\u201d But then, he\u2019s friends with Anna Wintour, too. How, I ask. Actually, more to the point, why? \u201cWell, I love her. I absolutely love that woman. I\u2019m seeing her for lunch in two weeks.\u201d But not Patrick Stewart: This article was amended 0n 6 August 2014 to correct a mis-stating of the name of the National Theatre in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
