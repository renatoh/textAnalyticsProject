I was one of those who helped in a minor way to draw up the draft chapter of the cabinet manual dealing with a hung parliament. The guidelines, which do no more than codify existing practice, neither facilitate coalition government, nor do they make it more difficult to achieve. They are entirely neutral as to outcomes, although, before the election, David Cameron expressed the fear that they might prove too helpful to the incumbent prime minister, Gordon Brown. At no time did O'Donnell or any of his colleagues express a view as to the desirability or otherwise of a coalition. The BBC2 documentary on the post-election negotiations showed that David Cameron, as soon as he was aware of the likely outcome of the election, took the view that a coalition would provide greater stability than a single-party minority government. The Liberal Democrats remembered the 1977-78 Lib-Lab pact when, so they believed, they attracted odium for policies which they had played little part in formulating. That no doubt is why they too preferred coalition. It is implausible to believe that either Cameron or Clegg were pushed into coalition by O'Donnell, and you provide no evidence to support this charge. Nor do you provide any evidence for fears of lack of trust between Labour and Whitehall. Neither Gordon Brown nor any other senior Labour ex-minister has, so far as I know, made any complaint against the Cabinet Office, whose role in the negotiations was that of facilitator rather than participant. In my opinion, the smoothness of the transition from Brown to Cameron owes a great deal to the pre-election preparations of O'Donnell and his colleagues and shows the British civil service at its best. Vernon Bogdanor Professor of government, Oxford University \u2022 In your criticism of the participation of the cabinet secretary in Nick Robinson's BBC2 documentary on the formation of the coalition you seem to ignore the value of bringing some of the details of the process into the public domain. This sits uneasily with your general support for freedom of information and is particularly ironic in the week that you published extensively the Afghanistan documents released to you by WikiLeaks. It is unfortunate, too, that you did not comment on the apparent refusal of Gordon Brown to participate in the programme. It is at least arguable that, given the participation of so many other parties to the negotiations, he had a duty to put his own position on the record rather than leaving it to be interpreted by Mandelson, Balls, Adonis and Campbell.
