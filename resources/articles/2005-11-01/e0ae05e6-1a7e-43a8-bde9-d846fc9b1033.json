Gilded people go there for golf and the beach with other rather pleased gilded types. Which is why I wanted to find some real life - in Trinidad. Tobago's big brother sees itself as the Caribbean's most influential island, whose commercial heart pumps to the gush and thrust of offshore oil. Away from those four blocks of shiny offices, Port of Spain reveals itself as an enchanting capital, alternately elegant and gritty. Its inhabitants are gorgeous - a spicy, sexy dish whose genetic recipe of African, French Creole, Spanish, British, Amerindian, Indian and Chinese antecedents has been slowly simmered in the tropical sun and nicely lubricated with rum and bitters. The Angostura Bitters distillery is out of town, and you smell its ripe, sharp, herbal aroma before you see its colonial balustrades. Inside, it's like being in a big glass of pink gin and I take the tour, learn little of the secret bitters recipe (save that it's mostly made from gentian root), admire a collection of cobalt butterflies and generally work up a thirst. Over a rum tasting with tour guide Andre, I learn that he's a Scorpio and that Trinidad's year is divided into the three months before the bawdy bacchanal that is February Carnival and the nine months afterwards - hence the very elevated November birthrate. Elevated myself after a tumbler of 18-year-old rum, I accept Andre's offer of Sunday at the beach, Trini-style. Thus, a carload of us starts Sunday with \"doubles\" at George's. A double consists of an elastic, fried, turmeric-spiked, hand-sized bread on which is ladled spicy channa (chickpea) curry, a sprinkle of julienned cucumber laced with scotch bonnet chilli pepper, and another bread on top. This finger food is a handy way to start your hungover Sunday, as attested by the bleary-eyed queue both at George's and at the stand opposite, which has a sign saying \"George X\". This is manned by George's ex-wife. We pause, sticky-fingered, at a gaudily painted 1950s Bedford lorry by Queen's Park Savannah where young coconuts are macheted and their milk decanted into empty Evian bottles, before tearing out of town. Soca blaring on the stereo, we climb the hills through Maracas national park, stopping at a kiosk to buy ice, cheap rum and spiced dried plums that taste of Benylin and Worcestershire sauce. Dropping down through slopes leafy thick with mango and papaya trees, we tip up at Morro Point and make for the beach. The Trini verb for hanging out is liming, and at Maracas Bay we lime with the burnished best of them. Rum and fresh coconut cocktails are mixed and we buy wraps of warm roasted chickpeas from a ginger Rasta. Lunch comes from the huddle of huts around the car park. There is Shark 'n' Bake - lime and garlic marinated sharkmeat, fried, hot-sauced and wrapped in glorious chewy bread - and Buss Up Shut, a flaky, torn-up roti that looks like a busted-up shirt and tastes like savoury silk. This I anoint with strong goat curry and a chopping of fresh green tomato. The paper bag it comes in is printed \"Scatter Seeds of Friendship\", an activity that Trinidadians perform with joy - and not just during Carnival. As the sun goes down over La Vache Point, accents thicken and the sweet urgent sounds of David Rudder pullulate and throb from a stack of beach-side speakers. The Tobago ferry crests the horizon, and, limed-up, we end a glorious, slow-down syncopated Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
