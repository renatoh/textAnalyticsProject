His team selection suggested his tried and trusted five-man middle line would contain and break but they were never able to show the quality required to complete successive passes to get Tim Cahill, the most advanced of the quintet, close to Yakubu Ayegbeni. Phil Neville, in the midfield anchor role, was deep to the point of resembling a third centre-back when Liverpool got forward and his more creative, goalscoring colleagues Mikel Arteta, Leon Osman, Cahill and Yakubu never found rhythm or individual form. The most important thing for a team playing at home with a holding midfielder against opposition in a flexible 4-4-2 is for their full-backs to join in. Thus, the onus was on Tony Hibbert and Joleon Lescott to get forward. However, if the team are unable to retain possession in central areas, the full-backs will have little or no confidence to venture in support. Everton's passing let them down sorely. They had no one to give passing opportunities to Arteta and Osman and no one near enough to support Yakubu or Cahill in behind from wide positions. Liverpool played patiently and waited for the inevitable opportunity. Everton appeared a team distinctly short on confidence; reactive rather than proactive. They need to look at the creative side and how to integrate Louis Saha without losing defensive stability. The late sending-off of Cahill failed to divert attention from the home side's negativity in their open play. Liverpool's line-up gave the impression that they would be dangerous attackers but it was a limp and haphazard first half devoid of scoring chances. Everton easily repelled their attacks, but were troubled by the frenetic nature of the game and, lacking confidence to play the ball out of defence, whacked it upfield to their lone front man Yakubu far too often. A series of niggling body checks raised the temperature and too many fouls made this difficult viewing. Mike Riley's inconsistency will encourage his critics. Liverpool monopolised possession but, with Neville deep, were forced to look wide. Here, Dirk Kuyt and Albert Riera were contained by double cover yet they were sound in their responsibilities to hold back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
