In other words, you can't type in two ports, obtain a quote and book the crossing online. You'll need to do your research first - using one of the first two sites listed below - and then visit the company's own site to find timetables and complete the booking. A disappointing state of affairs. Ferry Information Service Run by the Passenger Shipping Association, this recently launched effort serves very little purpose. You can't book here and, apart from a few driving tips, a static route map and links to the members of the PSA, it's a shocking waste of time. Irishferries.com Routes: Ireland-England/ Ireland-France Apart from a couple of broken links, this is an excellent site. Visitors can take a virtual tour of all the ferries (including the world's largest car ferry, Ulysses), get a quote, and book online. Navigation is exemplary and the Frequently Asked Questions section particularly useful. Brittany Ferries Routes: Britain and Cork to France/ Britain to Spain Efficient and intelligent online booking, although the supporting information is a little thin. DFDS Seaways Routes: Harwich and Newcastle to Scandinavia, Germany and Holland A well-thought-out timetable section is let down by a confusing booking system - how do you know which fare to choose from the pull-down menu? Best used for planning your trip rather than trying to book it. Stena Line Routes: UK and Ireland to Holland and Scandinavia Look at the timetables first; if you want to book online, you'll need to register. Again, the process is not wholly clear. Seafrance Route: Dover-Calais At first glance, the Seafrance site looks rather old-fashioned - but booking turns out to be simple and easy to understand, if a little slow. Online bookings attract a \u00a35 discount. P&amp;O Stena Line Route: Dover-Calais Despite a few minor problems in Netscape, it's certainly worth checking the prices here; Dover-Calais is a competitive route."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
