The storm left 140,000 people without electricity as it took down power lines and trees. Emergency services were on standby to attend to callouts, with 47 people evacuated from a campsite in Landes due to flooding. Meanwhile, a very warm and dry October in Australia has added to ongoing problems with drought. The country has experienced its third warmest October since records began, with the second warmest January to October period. Lower than average rainfall has exacerbated the drought, with October also being the fifth driest over a 120-year record. Drought has also been plaguing parts of South Africa, with low rainfall and poor infrastructure the main causes. The Eastern Cape province has been worst affected with crop failures, livestock deaths and school closures among the problems. In an effort to alleviate the situation strict water restrictions have been set. A wet weekend in October did bring some relief as it raised the major dam supply to 80%, but also caused flooding. In Kirstenbosch, 93mm of rain was recorded in just 14 hours. Despite the recent rain, restrictions are to remain in place until at least the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
