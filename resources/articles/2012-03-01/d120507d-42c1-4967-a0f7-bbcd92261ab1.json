Administrators for the Ibrox club set 5pm on Friday as the juncture by which potential buyers must detail how they would fund any deal and run Rangers as a going concern. A business plan is also understood to have been received from the United States. Murray, a former Rangers director, has been regarded as the favourite to gain control. \"I'd love there to be some certainty about the future of our club before next weekend's Old Firm game,\" Murray said. \"It would provide a massive boost to the team and its fans ahead of such an important game. To our mind there is no reason why that can't be achieved \u2013 we hope the administrators will agree.\" Yet it is also pertinent that Craig Whyte retains an 85% shareholding in the club, despite an imminent legal bid by the administrators to challenge that. Earlier on Friday the Rangers manager, Ally McCoist, claimed the threat of liquidation was receding. McCoist has held talks with potential purchasers of Rangers \u2013 including Kennedy and Murray \u2013 and will have more meetings next week. \"I'm not getting carried away but liquidation maybe looks a little bit further away than it did a while back when it seemed a bit closer,\" McCoist said. \"The threat of liquidation is still there \u2013 I'm not daft \u2013 but I'd be hopeful of being able to think it's a wee bit further away now. \"Liquidation is not out of the picture and that would be the worst scenario. We have to do everything we can to stop that happening. It was always lurking on our shoulder. It's not away completely but it seems a couple of steps back which is positive.\" Rangers' manager paid tribute to his playing squad, who agreed wage reductions to ensure there will be no further enforced redundancies at Ibrox until the end of the season at least. \"Everyone has a real concern for each other within the club,\" he said. \"The fact that, relatively speaking, there have been only minimal job losses, I would say that's one of our better results, if not our best result, of the season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
