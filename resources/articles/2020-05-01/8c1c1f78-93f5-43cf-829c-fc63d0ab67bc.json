Top stories Private medical responders who boarded the Ruby Princess cruise ship to test stranded crew for Covid-19 were just days later sent into a Sydney nursing home that is now suffering its own outbreak. Guardian Australia has confirmed two Aspen Medical surge staff clinicians, who tested crew on board the Ruby Princess when it was stuck off the coast of Port Kembla, later worked a shift inside the Newmarch House aged-care facility. Aspen Medical said both of the workers tested negative for Covid-19 before being deployed to the home. Guardian Australia does not suggest the workers were personally responsible for any further spread of the virus at the facility. Meanwhile, new polling shows two-thirds of Australians back the right of aged-care homes to ban visitors.

There are reports the administration is looking to wind down its coronavirus taskforce in coming weeks \u2013 even though the rate of infections continues to rise across the country.

Covid-19 infections are growing rapidly in Russia and there are concerns about the lack of PPE for medical workers. In the UK, the number of key workers who are testing positive for Covid-19 has overtaken the number of sick people testing positive in hospitals, and the government\u2019s own science adviser has admitted it\u2019s yet to come to grips with the number of coronavirus deaths in UK care homes. A key expert working on the UK\u2019s response has resigned from the government\u2019s advisory group after admitting to breaking lockdown rules.

Brazil, France and Germany have replied to the petition, saying it should not be admissible. Reported cases of domestic violence in Russia have more than doubled during the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, according to its human rights commissioner.

The human cost of the climate crisis will hit harder, wider and sooner than previously believed, according to a study that shows a billion people will either be displaced or forced to endure insufferable heat. Dozens of paving stones made from Jewish headstones have been found during redevelopment work in Prague\u2019s tourist district. The find confirms speculation that the former communist regime raided synagogues and graveyards for building materials. Recommended reads How can I persuade my parents to have a practical conversation about mortality? That\u2019s the tough question our advice columnist and ethicist Eleanor Gordon-Smith tackles today. She says a gentle approach is key: \u201cPart of why talking about death is so hard is that when you talk about it you make it real.
