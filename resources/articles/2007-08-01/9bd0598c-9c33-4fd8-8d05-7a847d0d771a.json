The Conservative leader flew to Kabul yesterday from the UK for what was originally intended to be the second leg of a visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Pakistan leg was cancelled for security and logistical reasons but Mr Cameron landed in Afghanistan yesterday to meet Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, US General Dan McNeill, commander of Nato forces, and Sir Sherard Cowper, the British ambassador. The visit to meet some of the 7,700 British troops stationed in the country today is to show \"cross-party support\" for their efforts, Mr Cameron said. On Sunday, Michael Jones, a Special Boat Service commando, died in a gun battle, the 68th member of the British armed forces to die in the country since 2001. Mr Cameron was criticised by some of his Witney constituents last week for pressing ahead with a visit to Rwanda while there were floods at home. He is due to go on holiday at the end of this week. \"There is no room for complacency. There are risks of failing in Afghanistan. We cannot afford to fail. If we fail we will see an increase in terrorism, an increase in drugs, and dangerous instability in this region,\" he said. Thirty-seven countries supply a total of 37,000 troops to the international security assistance force in Afghanistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
