The Tottenham player featured for only 22 minutes of the past two friendlies. Southgate intends to select his preliminary squad on 14 May, the day after the Premier League season ends, and confirmed that he was nearing a final decision regarding the strikers and attacking midfielders. Alli is assured of a place, injuries permitting, but the manager has slightly modified his system in the past two games and the player did not get off the bench in the 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday. \u201cI have a problem because I have Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jamie Vardy so there is a huge choice,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee a scenario where any of those players don\u2019t come to Russia but I have to make those decisions. There is no reason he [Alli] will not come and he can make a huge impact there. He has the ability and I am looking forward to seeing him over the next few weeks.\u201d Alli, according to Southgate, was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by his omission but the manager also said that Kane\u2019s return from injury would be another influence at the World Cup because of the understanding between the two Spurs players. Alli was nursing a very minor groin injury during England\u2019s training sessions but this is the first time since establishing himself in the national side that he has dropped out of the team and the manager was encouraged by the way Raheem Sterling adapted to a central attacking role. Southgate said: \u201cIt was nice to see because if we play 3-4-3 we know Raheem can play the No 10 role, as he did against France last year, but could he play as one of two forwards when he usually plays on the wing for Manchester City? We know he likes playing through the middle and his performance reminded me of that little spell at Liverpool where he was behind Luis Su\u00e1rez and Daniel Sturridge, running and dribbling through the middle of the park.\u201d Southgate is also an admirer of Adam Lallana but the manager said the decision to leave out Alli was not an attempt to make the Spurs player knuckle down in the final weeks of the season. \u201cWe want competition for places but there was no ulterior motive to leaving him out. We wanted to look at Raheem again but Dele is still an important player for us. He is in the mix.\u201d England have friendlies against Nigeria at Wembley on 2 June and Costa Rica in Leeds five days later. In the meantime, Southgate intends to maintain a regular dialogue with his players and is mindful that those who do not go to the World Cup should be let down gently. \u201cThere are some who have worked with us for quite a while and know they will be part of the squad. There are others who know, after the conversations I\u2019ve had with them, that they are on the edge of it. \u201cIt\u2019s important that it doesn\u2019t come as a huge surprise to anybody. I\u2019ve got to keep those conversations going over the next few weeks \u2013 letting people know how I see it, so in the end it doesn\u2019t come dramatically to anyone.\u201d Southgate has had one such conversation with Joe Hart now that the goalkeeper has fallen behind Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland in the England set-up. \u201cI\u2019ve been really straight with him throughout. I spoke to him three weeks ago before he was back in West Ham\u2019s team and told him he would be in the squad on the basis of what he had done for us before. He\u2019s a good leader to have around and he\u2019s understood everything completely. He\u2019s played that [back-up] role really well.\u201d Lallana confident he can make World Cup mark Adam Lallana has declared himself fit and ready to make a mark over the run-in to Liverpool\u2019s season to prove he warrants significant involvement at the World Cup. The midfielder has been restricted to 375 minutes of club football this term, and a solitary Premier League start, after a thigh injury last summer. He played the last half-hour of Tuesday\u2019s draw with Italy. \u201cI\u2019m fully fit now,\u201d Lallana said. \u201cI had to manage myself for the first couple of days [of the England get-together], hence why I wasn\u2019t involved over in Holland. It was just great to be back out there in an England shirt for the first time since last summer. I\u2019m smart enough not to be complacent and to know there are plenty of talented players that want to make sure they are picked, even lads who weren\u2019t with us this month. But I\u2019m confident enough in my ability and what I bring to the squad. \u201cNow it\u2019s just about getting that rhythm, which means gaining minutes out on the pitch playing competitive football. There is plenty of time between now and the end of the season. I\u2019m physically and mentally as fresh as anyone going into the back end of the season and going into the World Cup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
