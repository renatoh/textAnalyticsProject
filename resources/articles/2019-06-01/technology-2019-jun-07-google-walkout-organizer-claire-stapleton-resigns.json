Claire Stapleton, a longtime marketing manager at Google and its subsidiary YouTube, said she decided to leave the company after 12 years when it became clear that her trajectory at the company was \u201ceffectively over\u201d. \u201cI made the choice after the heads of my department branded me with a kind of scarlet letter that makes it difficult to do my job or find another one,\u201d she wrote in an email to co-workers announcing her departure on 31 May. \u201cIf I stayed, I didn\u2019t just worry that there\u2019d be more public flogging, shunning, and stress, I expected it.\u201d \u201cThe message that was sent [to others] was: \u2018You\u2019re going to compromise your career if you make the same choices that Claire made,\u201d she told the Guardian by phone. \u201cIt was designed to have a chilling effect on employees who raise issues or speak out.\u201d Stapleton was one of the core group of Google employees who sprang into action in October 2018 following a report in the New York Times that Google had paid a $90m severance package to the former executive Andy Rubin despite finding credible an allegation that he had forced a female employee to perform oral sex. The employees organized a \u201cGoogle Walkout for Change\u201d on 1 November 2018 that drew tens of thousands of participants at Google offices around the globe. Among the group\u2019s demands were an end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination, as well as the appointment of an employee representative to the company\u2019s board of directors. Google executives publicly supported the employee activism, and acceded to one of the demands on arbitration. But in April, Stapleton and her fellow organizer Meredith Whittaker spoke out in internal letters about what they said was a \u201cculture of retaliation\u201d. In the letters, Stapleton said that two months after the walkout, she was demoted and \u201ctold to go on medical leave\u201d despite not being sick. The demotion was reversed after she hired a lawyer, she said. In a statement, Google said: \u201cWe thank Claire for her work at Google and wish her all the best. To reiterate, we don\u2019t tolerate retaliation,\u201d It added: \u201cOur employee relations team did a thorough investigation of her claims and found no evidence of retaliation. They found that Claire\u2019s management team supported her contributions to our workplace, including awarding her their team Culture Award for her role in the Walkout.\u201d Stapleton says the backlash intensified after her allegations spread both internally and in the press. Two managers emailed her entire department to rebut the allegation, she said, a move she claims was \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201ctruly unprecedented\u201d given company norms around speaking about individual personnel issues. \u201cIn a way it showed me how powerful the organizing has been because it was truly extreme,\u201d she added. Stapleton\u2019s departure comes amid considerable turmoil for Google and YouTube, which are facing increased antitrust scrutiny from the US government, criticism over inconsistent and controversial decisions related to content moderation, and growing activism from employees over issues including the company\u2019s treatment of temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs). Stapleton said that in her view, all these problems were related: \u201cThe one very simple thing that connects all these issues is that it requires leadership and real accountability, and that\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve seen in these very challenging, high-stakes times. \u201cYou could connect the way that TVCs are treated all the way up to how an Andy Rubin payment happens,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are systemic imbalances.\u201d Stapleton said that despite her decision to leave the company, she was optimistic about the future of worker organizing at Google. \u201cI\u2019ve paid a huge personal cost in a way that is not easy to ask anyone else to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of exhaustion and there\u2019s a lot of fear, but I think that speaking up in whatever way people are comfortable with is having an absolutely tremendous impact.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not going away,\u201d she added.
