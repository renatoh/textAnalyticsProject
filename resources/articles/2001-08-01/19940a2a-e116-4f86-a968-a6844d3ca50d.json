Though the weapon is not manufactured in Britain, the decision to outlaw its sale abroad by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence shows there are significant concerns in Whitehall about the use of electro-shock weapons. The taser was banned for export in July 1997 along with all electro-shock weapons, leg irons, gang chains and shackles. It was classified as \"equipment used for torture\". In its strategic exports control annual report last year, the DTI announced the government was also \"committed to extending the unilateral ban on the export of equipment used for torture to include the trafficking and brokering of such equipment\". Despite the policy, the Met is hoping to buy a batch of the tasers from America in time for specialist firearms officers to be using them by Christmas. The force's plans, revealed by the Guardian yesterday, were also questioned by Brian Rappert, of York University, who is a leading authority on taser technology. He warned there have been no meaningful independent studies into the health risks associated with tasers, which paralyse their victims by delivering a high-powered electric shock through a two-pronged dart. \"It's almost like the BSE situation,\" said Dr Rappert. \"A lack of definitive medical evidence is being treated as a sign of safety.\" One report on the medical effects, which was prepared in America for British police forces, was watered down when its findings were challenged by a consultant for the manufacturers, he added. \"Some independent studies were done about 30 years ago, but the weapons were very different then. The Metropolitan police must be able to justify the decision to use the taser after considering independent reports about its safety. I don't think such independent reports exist. To go ahead without them would be highly inappropriate,\" he said. Police groups gave a cautious welcome to the decision to deploy tasers in London. The Police Complaints Authority said they could be used in certain highly dangerous situations if officers were trained properly and acted within set guidelines. \"We would see stun guns being used when people are clearly armed with a knife or sword,\" said PCA deputy chairman, Ian Bynoe. \"The training must ensure that vulnerable parts of the body, such as the eyes, are protected. \"The shock delivered is painful and must therefore be delivered for the minimum length of time - just a second and no more. \"The Human Rights Act justifies the taking of life by the state only when absolutely nec essary and we would therefore support a trial of stun guns as an alternative to the police having to use lethal force.\" Amnesty urged the Met to suspend its plans to deploy tasers until \"there has been proper, independent, medical investigation\" into the use of the weapons. \"This device fires darts sharp enough to pierce a leather jacket. If that were to hit you in the face it would cause an extremely debilitating injury,\" said a spokesman. \"If the medical risks are found to be acceptably low there should also proper training and guidelines on when they can be used.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
