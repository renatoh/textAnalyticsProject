Not until substitute Alan Thompson, who had replaced Steve Guppy after 30 minutes, left-footed his 25-yard free-kick high to the left of Craig Nelson and followed up with a left-foot chip, placed perfectly to the goalkeeper's right, to compliment Henrik Larsson's opener, were the current holders able to believe that an obstinate Ayr United had finally been eliminated. Anyone who attended the match in expectation of a quick kill would be ignorant of the condition of the surface on which it would be played. At the national stadium these days, few teams would achieve even pass marks for artistic impression. On the kind of dead soil that would bankrupt a farmer, Celtic encountered the same difficulties as Rangers against the same opponents six days earlier in the CIS Insurance Cup final. This was an assignment in which the working conditions would demand patience and caution. With the ball running off the true when an incisive pass was attempted, bobbling at the moment of impact of a scoring attempt or simply sticking in the potholes dotted around the pitch, a contest that had seemed grotesquely imbalanced was made to look for lengthy periods like a close call. Much of this, of course, was attributable to the stout resistance of the First Division side, whose experience against the other Old Firm partner was clearly of enornmous benefit. As in the CIS Cup final, they managed to contain their powerful opponents before coming very close to taking the lead. It was shortly before the interval that they produced two threatening moments, which must have had the Celtic supporters gulping. A long ball from defence forced Bobo Balde into hesitant policing as Robert Douglas advanced from his goal, allowing James Grady to rush between them but his low drive went wide of the untended net. Paul Sheerin also gave the big goalkeeper a hard time when he came in from the left and delivered a powerful shot which Douglas beat down before Neil Lennon cleared. The loss of a goal at that point would have given Celtic proper anxieties, as they had already demonstrated their own profligacy near goal. John Hartson was most culpable, the big Welshman pushing into the area after getting the break of the ball from a Johan Mjallby cross, but right-footing the shot wide. He repeated the mistake soon after, playing a one-two with Henrik Larsson which left him with Craig Nelson to beat from the right side of the area. This time he appeared to be affected by the surface as he pulled the low drive wide of the far post.. Larsson was nothing like as wasteful when allowed the opportunity to open the scoring, but that was understandable, given the quality of Didier Agathe's service. The Frenchman gathered the ball on the right and simply ran away from Paul Lovering, heading for the dead ball line. On reaching at his destination, he looked up, rolled the ball towards the near post, and Larsson, arriving at pace, had merely to flick the ball over the line from a distance of about two yards. It was the kind of slick, devastating movement which is virtually impossible to defend. The same could be said of those late strikes from Thompson, the former Aston Villa man removing all anxieties - and they had been plentiful - in spectacular fashion. In truth, the final score was more severe than United deserved. The first division side were clearly out on their feet in the final minutes as Celtic's superior fitness began to tell. But the Ayr battlers can take a lot of pride from their two performances against the Old Firm in the past week. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
