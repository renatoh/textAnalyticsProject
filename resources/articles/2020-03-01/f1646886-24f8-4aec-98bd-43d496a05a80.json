The S&amp;P 500 is down 15% for the week. The Dow fell over 900 points on Friday after a brief morning rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 12% over the week. It\u2019s been the worst week for investors since the 2008 financial crisis. Gold and oil fell too as investors moved to cash. In New York claims for unemployment have rocketed and the state is struggling to cope with increases in claims of up to 1,000%. In the UK the government has pledged to pay 80% of wages for those who have lost their jobs to the pandemic. The floor of the New York Stock Exchange will be empty of traders on Monday after two people tested positive for coronavirus infection. So no men (mainly) in funny coats. But trading will continue electronically - most of it is done that way anyway. Thanks for reading. We will be back with all the live business news on Monday. In the meantime, stay safe and wash your hands. You can follow all the latest Covid-19 developments here. Among those New Yorkers being laid off we mentioned earlier: billionaire would-be president Mike Bloomberg\u2019s staff. They are not happy. There is mounting anger among the self employed over what they regard as insufficient support for them in the emergency measures announced this evening in the UK by chancellor Rishi Sunak. The self employed will gain access to the equivalent of Statutory Sick Pay, and be given tax deferrals, but are not part of the 80% earnings pledge. The Federation of Small Business said: \u201cThe question at this point is \u2013 with firms beingforcedto close \u2013 why have the self-employed been excluded from the commitment to pay 80% of earnings? \u201cIt cannot be right that an employee currently earning \u00a325,000 a year could access \u00a320,000 per annum through the new job retention scheme, while someone who\u2019s self-employed earning the same sum might only access around \u00a35,000 worth of support.\u201d Phillipa Childs of the Bectu union, which covers thousands of freelancers in the entertainment and media industry, added: \u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s support package for workers will come as a devastating blow to freelance and self-employed workers who needed much more support than they are being given. \u201cHe must urgently revise his income support plan to include these workers and not force them onto the welfare system and we will be making urgent representations to government to make sure all our members are protected during this crisis.\u201d More frightening news on Covid-19\u2019s economic impact. Goldman Sachs is now predicting the pandemic will trigger an unprecedented 24% decline in the US economy in second quarter, following a 6% decline in the first quarter. That\u2019s the most grisly prediction from a big bank economist so far. The bank\u2019s economists expect a bounce back of 12% in the third quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter, but unemployment will surge to 9%. \u201cOver the last few days social distancing measures have shut down normal life in much of the US. News reports point to a sudden surge in layoffs and a collapse in spending, both historic in size and speed, as well as shutdowns of many schools, stores, offices, manufacturing plants and construction sites,\u201d the economists said. \u201cThese developments argue for a much sharper drop in GDP in Q1 and Q2.\u201d With less than an hour of trading left all the major markets are back in the red - again. If this holds, it will be the worst week on US stock markets since the financial crisis of 2008. As it stands: Dow Jones - down 3.3% S&amp;P 500 - down 3.3% Nasdaq - down 2.3% New York - now a major center of new Covid-19 infections - is cracking under the strain of people applying for unemployment benefits. As restaurants, bars, hotels and other businesses close thousands are trying to get benefits in order to meet their bills. The New York state labor department said it received 159,000 calls by noon on Thursday, compared with the average of 10,000 calls a day. In some parts of the state, the department said, there was a 1,000% increase in claims. The website is seeing a 400% increase above normal in logins each day. You can read the full story here: This as Goldman Sachs is warning new claims for unemployment could pass two million for the week ending March 21, his most conservative estimate of a million claims which would top the record high of 695,000 in 1982. Sterling is in retreat after chancellor Rishi Sunak announced some truly historic measures which will see a big increase in government borrowing. You can read the main announcements for business here, and follow the reaction to Sunak\u2019s speech here. The pound is up by 1.2% for the day - a percentage point less than points earlier this afternoon - at $1.1621 against the US dollar. Sunak\u2019s announcements came after the FTSE 100 gained 0.76% on Friday, closing at 5,190.78 points - the lowest end-of-week close since 2011. In Europe the Stoxx 600 gained 1.8%, with the Cac 40 in France gaining 5%. Dominic Rushe will now take over the live blog. JJ Here are some more reactions to the chancellor\u2019s emergency package. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: The chancellor has given businesses desperately needed breathing room at this critical moment. The deferral of VAT payments keeps money in the pockets of businesses so that they can pay their people and suppliers, and the commitment to cover wages of those unable to work will allow firms to retain jobs if they are forced to reduce their operations. The government now needs to go foot-to-floor to ensure that details of the job retention scheme and loan guarantees reach firms on the ground as soon as possible. Given that this situation continues to evolve, ministers must also keep the door open to additional measures to support business cash flow. Matthew Cady, investment strategist at Brooks Macdonald, an investment manager, said: Today\u2019s steps by the chancellor are building on the confidence that we\u2019re now seeing from markets that the policy responses arriving are getting to the size that\u2019s needed. Within the gains in UK equities today, we\u2019re seeing relative outperformance in more UK-focused domestic companies, unwinding some of the weakness they\u2019ve seen coming into today\u2019s announcement. What is needed from governments and politicians is a \u2018right-now\u2019 plan, and it\u2019s good to see that the chancellor has finally recognised this with the measures he is taking today. For markets, the coronavirus outbreak will clearly drive a significant jolt to the UK economy over the next one or two quarters. But with UK policy makers now giving it both fiscal and monetary barrels, there are good chances that this stays a short-term impact. Today\u2019s actions should start to give investors some encouragement to take advantage of the pullback in valuations as they think about their longer-term investment horizons. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said: The UK is now running a \u2018virus war\u2019 economy. The usual rules do not apply. Providing cash-strapped firms with generous subsidies to retain their staff will dramatically lower the risk of surging unemployment during the corona virus recession. Encouraging firms to hoard their labour while authorities tackle the medical emergency raises the chance that the economy can get back to normal quickly once any containment restrictions are lifted. It is hard to say at this early stage exactly how much the employment subsidy scheme will cost. As a proportion of annual GDP, quarterly aggregate employees compensation is around 12.5%. If the scheme runs into two quarters or more, the cost in % of GDP to the treasury will easily be double-digits. Across the world central banks and governments are working a hard to prevent the inevitable corona-virus recession from developing into a financial crisis. We continue to see enough evidence that, in the UK and in other advanced economies, policymakers will likely pull it off, in the end. And the pound is now back to a 1.5% gain, at $1.1665 against the US dollar. Some reaction is starting to come in from business groups and unions. Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW, an accountancy body, said: The real battle now is for public confidence: if we can sustain that, the economics will follow. The chancellor\u2019s announcement of direct action by government to keep people in employment is a really good start. This should make a difference to how people feel, and keep them working and spending. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, a union, said: The government has finally acted to secure incomes during the pandemic and we welcome the steps they have taken on universal credit, tax delays and income protection for employees. However this is far from the \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 approach the chancellor promised and his plan still contains gaping holes which could sink many family finances and ultimately the economy. This is too late for many of our members from flight engineers to cinema staff who have already been let go. The chancellor must make it clear that these workers should be rehired with their incomes secured by government for the duration of the crisis. They should not pay the price of the government dragging its feet. There is still no real protection for freelance, self-employed and contract workers who seem not to be covered by the income protection scheme and are being left to struggle through the inadequate benefits system . There\u2019s a bit more movement in the pound now, and it\u2019s going in reverse. One pound will buy you less than $1.17 - so it has given up some of the earlier gains. It\u2019s up by 1.8% for the day. Closing pubs, bars, restaurants Boris Johnson said all cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants must close tonight. Nightclubs, theatres, gyms, cinemas and leisure centres must also close on the same timescale. Paying wages To protect jobs, the chancellor announces that the government will step in and help pay wages, for the first time in UK history. It\u2019s called the coronavirus job retention scheme. Companies and organisations will be able to apply for a grant from HMRC to cover the wages of people who are not working due to coronavirus shutdowns, but who haven\u2019t been laid off. It will cover 80% of the salaries of these retained workers, up to \u00a32,500 per month. It means that workers across the company can retain their jobs, even if their bosses can\u2019t afford to pay them, Sunak explains. VAT holiday no business will pay VAT from now to June, and they\u2019ll have until the end of the financial year to repay those bills. That should help companies struggling with a cash flow crisis. The chancellor this will injection \u00a330bn into the economy. Business loan scheme The government is also extending its coronavirus business interruption loan scheme, to be interest free for 12 months (up from 6 months). Deferring self-assessment deadline for taxes The deadline for self-assessment of taxes will be extended to January 2021, meaning that self-employed people will have longer to pay their taxes. The announcements appear to have barely affected the pound, which is still up by 2.1% against the US dollar. We will let you know if that changes. One pound will buy you $1.1727 at the moment. The VAT holiday, which will affect almost every business in the UK, will represent a \u00a330bn cash injection into the economy. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is announcing historic measures to help businesses. No businesses will pay VAT until the end of June, a deferral of tax payments for another quarter. Boris Johnson has ordered pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can. Night clubs, gyms, cinemas and leisure centres should also close, he says. Boris Johnson is now talking in his daily briefing. He is joined by chancellor Rishi Sunak. Please go to the UK coronavirus live blog to follow coverage live. EasyJet will ground the majority of its aircraft fleet from Tuesday 24 March, the airline has announced. It will conclude rescue flights to repatriate customers by Monday, and will at most continue to run \u201ca minimal schedule\u201d of essential, mainly domestic routes. With so many no-shows in recent weeks, EasyJet urged customers who do not intend to travel to rebook now to match any remaining flights to demand. The airline has asked staff to take three months unpaid leave, but angered unions by also trying to reduce terms and conditions such as flexible rosters and meals. *And apologies for the repetition on airlines\u2019 unapid leave earlier. JJ Sterling is up by 2.2% against the US dollar this week - although it is down by 8.4% in the month to date, an indication of just how rough the past few months have been. The rise in the dollar\u2019s value has been sparked by companies\u2019 need to get hold of the reserve currency in any way they can, even if that means exchanging other currencies or even assets like bonds that are usually thought of as a boon during times of market turbulence. Today the pound and other currencies have been aided by further central bank interventions to keep the flow of dollars coming. As this Reuters report explains: The British currency had been one of several to tank as investors rushed to put their money in dollars, the world\u2019s most liquid currency and seen as a safe haven in times of crisis. Six central banks including the BoE announced coordinated action to enhance liquidity in US dollars on Friday by holding more frequent currency swap operations, further steadying nerves in money markets. The global aviation industry is going through unprecedented turmoil, and companies are desperate to secure their financial future. That will mean pay halving for the next two months for British Airways pilots and potentially worse for Easyjet as the effects of global travel restrictions take hold, according to Reuters. British Airways pilots will be required to take two weeks\u2019 unpaid leave in both April and May while rival easyJet is reported to have asked staff to take three months\u2019 unpaid leave as the battered aviation sector frantically seeks to cut costs. A quick spin around global markets as Europe\u2019s trading day ends. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is up by 0.1%. That would almost look like a normal day - but it masks some big individual moves either way. The FTSE 250 has gained 4.8%. The Euro Stoxx 600 has gained 1.4%, buoyed by a 4.3% jump on France\u2019s Cac 40 and 3% on the German Dax index. US stock market indices are in the red, with the S&amp;P 500 down by 2%. Sterling has gained 2.2% against the US dollar. The euro is flat against the dollar. Brent crude oil futures have gained 2.2% over the course of another bumpy day, with prices at $27.82 per barrel. The three main US stock market indices have now all fallen back into the red. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 1.6%, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite is down by 1%. The Farnborough air show, the UK aerospace industry\u2019s key event, has been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The biannual show had been scheduled for July, with tens thousands of executives and air fans due to gather in Hampshire. The show is usually the occasion for deals worth tens of billions of pounds. In a statement, the organisers said: After very careful consideration, the unprecedented impact of the global Coronavirus pandemic has forced this decision in the interests of the health and safety of our exhibitors, visitors, contractors and staff. This decision was reached taking into consideration several major factors surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19, all of which we have concluded, make it is impossible for us to create and host the Airshow this July. JP Morgan is handing its front-line bank staff in the US $1000 each for working through the Covid-19 outbreak. The measure is meant to support staff across its retail banking operations who have to keep its bank branches and call centres running and can\u2019t work from home. A memo sent to staff on Friday said front-line staff would receive a \u201cone-time Covid-19 special payment equal to a maximum of US$1,000\u201d. This won\u2019t apply to the bank\u2019s near 16,000 UK employees, most of which work for its investment bank. Instead, they\u2019re being offered up to five extra paid days leave to help staff manage care and service disruptions during the outbreak. A sharp contraction of the global economy, at least in the second quarter, appears imminent, according to Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency. It points to data from China that show eye-watering declines in activity. There has been a sharp contraction relative to last year in retail sales (-20.5%), industrial production (-13.5%) and fixed-asset investment (-24.5%). Add 5m job losses in January and February and it\u2019s a stark illustration of what Europe, the USA and others could shortly face. Madhavi Bokil, a Moody\u2019s senior credit office, said: The short-term economic costs are likely to be steep, the world over. In advanced and emerging market countries alike, closures are crippling both the traded and non-traded sectors of the real economy. The long-term consequences will depend not only on the depth and duration of the hit to economic output, but on whether it will cause lasting damage to balance sheets of households and businesses. Without policy support, many businesses that depend on a constant stream of revenue will close and lay off their workers. While the shock could disrupt many sectors, the burden will weigh disproportionately on the transportation sector, the energy industry, hospitality, healthcare and consumer services, especially hotels, restaurants and leisure. In the worst case, entire industries could be destroyed. Jack Wills, the clothing retailer, has announced the immediate closure of five stores. The British brand, which was rescued out of administration by Frasers Group plc in August 2019, will close stores in Dublin, Exeter, Cambridge, Bath and Manchester Trafford Centre. The chain was bought as part of an acquisition spree led by Mike Ashley, the billionaire boss of Frasers, which was previously known as Sports Direct International. A spokesperson said: The group has been working closely with landlords since acquiring Jack Wills to keep as many stores open as possible. Now faced by unprecedented uncertainty in the retail environment, further closures are inevitable. For more context on the US municipal bond market, here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 report from yesterday on rising yields (meaning prices are falling) for those borrowers: Yields in the US municipal bond market, where states, cities, schools and other issuers sell debt, skyrocketed on Thursday amid a selling frenzy by virus-rattled investors who pulled a record amount of money out of muni funds in a race for cash. The $3.8tn muni market has experienced big yield swings as the coronavirus has spread through the nation affecting businesses, governments and everyday life. Lipper reported net outflows from muni bond funds of an astounding $12.2 billion in the week ended March 18, the largest weekly muni flows in data going back to 1992. That followed $1.76 billion of outflows in the previous week. So just to recap the support that the Fed has offered in the battle against the economic fallout from the coronavirus: Two emergency interest rate cuts, taking borrowing costs to nearly 0%. $700bn in new bond buying under the quantitative easing programme. New swap lines worth as much as $450bn offering US dollars to central banks around the world. Aid to struggling municipal borrowers. The US Federal Reserve has made yet another intervention to support the US economy, this time expanding support to municipal bond markets, which are key for the funding of local city authorities. Local government authorities are on the front line of the battle against coronavirus disruption in many countries, leading to fears from investors that they could come under financial pressure. Here\u2019s the statement from the Fedearl Reserve: The Federal Reserve Board on Friday expanded its program of support for the flow of credit to the economy by taking steps to enhance the liquidity and functioning of crucial state and municipal money markets. Through the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or MMLF, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston will now be able to make loans available to eligible financial institutions secured by certain high-quality assets purchased from single state and other tax-exempt municipal money market mutual funds. Jasper Jolly here, taking over from Angela for the next few hours. Wall Street has extended its earlier gains, with sentiment boosted by the news that US taxpayers will have an extra 3 months to file their returns and expectations of further measures. The latest from US markets: Dow Jones: +2% or 399 points at 20,486 Nasdaq: +2.8% or 200 points at 7,343 S&amp;P 500: +1.6% or 39 points at 2,448 Ford has become the latest car maker to announce temporary factory closures in the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic. The US manufacturer does not make cars in the UK but said its engine-making plants at Dagenham and Bridgend, which produced 1.1m engines between them last year, would be suspended from next Monday and Wednesday respectively. The shutdown will also be extended across the remainder of the business, barring a small number of employees, a decision affecting 12,900 UK staff, with around 5,000 of them in direct manufacturing. All employees will receive pay at least equivalent to their base wage. Airlines have been taking further measures to secure their businesses, faced with virtually no flights operating during April and May - at the very least. British Airways pilots will take half of April and May as unpaid leave, unions have agreed. EasyJet has asked pilots and cabin crew to take three months\u2019 unpaid leave, and reduce terms and conditions, according to the BBC. Ryanair staff across the board will be taking a 50% pay cut for April and May, boss Michael O\u2019Leary told the FT. Air New Zealand was promised loans of up to NZ$900m (\u00a3438m) by the NZ government to ensure its survival. Analysts aired fresh doubts over Norwegian Air despite credit guarantees from the Oslo government worth up to 6bn kroner (\u00a3450m). Cathay Pacific subsidiary HK Express is ending all flights. Cathay, the main Hong Kong carrier, has already axed more than 90% of its schedule. Air Canada is temporarily laying off more than 5,000 flight attendants. The Guardian US has more on the decision to extend the tax deadline by three months: Americans will have an extra three months to file their taxes, to ease the pressure on finances caused by Covid-19. The deadline has been extended to 15 July. The measure was announced on Twitter by US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin: The City regulator has told banks and building societies that they must not repossess people\u2019s homes during the coronavirus crisis, and cannot charge fees for payment holidays granted as a result of the pandemic. In guidance to lenders, the FCA said: \u201cFirms should not commence or continue repossession proceedings against customers at this time, given the unprecedented uncertainty and upheaval they face, and government advice on social distancing and self-isolation. \u201cThis applies irrespective of the stage that repossession proceedings have reached and to any step taken in pursuit of repossession. Where a possession order has already been obtained, firms should refrain from enforcing it.\u201d The FCA said that lenders should offer three-month payment holidays to struggling buyers, and were not expected to investigate customers\u2019 circumstances before saying yes. They said banks could continue to charge interest but were not allowed to levy any other fees. Here is our full story on the competition watchdog\u2019s decision to launch a Covid-19 taskforce. The Competition and Markets Authority aims to identify traders that are unfairly raising prices on goods in short supply, such as hand sanitiser and loo roll. Kevin Loane, economist at the consultancy Fathom, says there is likely to be an unprecedented spike in US unemployment: US initial jobless claims rose by a near record amount last week; they could rise by three million this week, indicating the negative shock to the US economy could be the largest on record. He says the lockdown in California, which could be swiftly followed by New York, may cause an unprecedented rise in jobless claims: California normally accounts for almost one-fifth of all US jobless claims. The state\u2019s governor has said that initial claims totalled 40,000 on Sunday, and doubled to 80,000 by Tuesday. If you average that over a week, it is consistent with initial claims in California alone spiking to 525,000 - a level that is entirely without precedent. Based on an upward trend, and the recently announced lockdown, the risk is that the final figure ends up higher. Across the states for which we have data, claims so far this week are running at a rate that is 15 times higher than they were in March last year. That figure is consistent with a rise in jobless claims from 281,000 to around three million next week. That would be the largest such increase by a factor of more than ten. If it comes to pass, that would be consistent with the unemployment rate increasing by around 2 percentage points in a single week - a figure that is more than double the largest ever monthly increase in the unemployment rate. For what it is worth, that scale of increase is consistent with reported figures coming out of Ireland. The bell has rung on Wall Street and markets have opened higher - but the gains are pretty limited so far. Dow Jones: +0.8% Nasdaq: +1.6% S&amp;P 500: +0.9% As employees, employers and investors await the chancellor\u2019s package of measures to protect pay and jobs during Covid-19 - expected later this afternoon - the ONS has published the latest snapshot on the public finances. The figures show a slightly better borrowing picture than expected in February. The government borrowed around \u00a3300m last month, that\u2019s roughly half the amount in the same month a year ago. Borrowing has however been steadily rising, by around \u00a34.2bn more so far this year than the same period a year earlier. And attention is turning to the damage the coronavirus outbreak will cause. Rishi Sunak\u2019s emergency measures to combat the economic fallout - \u00a312bn at last week\u2019s budget topped up with a further \u00a320bn in spending this week - will cause the deficit to explode in the next financial year. Analysts at Capital Economics estimate borrowing as a percentage of the UK economy could balloon to 8% of GDP, a massive jump from official estimates for a deficit worth around 2.5% of GDP, as government spending dramatically rises and the economy and tax receipts fall off a cliff. For context, borrowing reached peaked at around 10% of GDP following the 2008 financial crisis. Asda has announced it will hire more than 5,000 temporary employees who have been laid off due to Covid-19. Chief executive Roger Burnley said: Never in my 30 years in retail have I ever felt so keenly the role played by supermarkets in our communities. The way our colleagues are working to support the nation is incredible and I want to support them \u2013 and those closest to them who are experiencing the other end of this crisis and need work. Where we can provide opportunities for employment, even short term, to help people through this period, we want to play our part. And where we are able to reduce the strain on our smaller suppliers and tenants \u2013 we will do so. Lidl meanwhile said it would create 2,500 jobs across its 800 stores. The roles will be temporary and will pay at least \u00a39.30 an hour, the German supermarket chain said. Christian H\u00e4rtnagel, chief executive at Lidl in the UK, said: Our store colleagues are doing an incredible job at keeping our shelves stocked, and serving communities during an extremely challenging period. Temporarily expanding our teams is one way we can help support our colleagues and customers, whilst providing work to those that have had their employment affected by the current situation. Time for a market update: FTSE 100: +1.7% at 5,236 Germany\u2019s Dax: +4.5% at 8,996 France\u2019s Cac 40: +5.4% at 4,064 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib: +1.7% at 15,727 Spain\u2019s Ibex: +3.7% at 6,634 Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600: +2.9% at 296 More on the prospect of a UK recession from my colleague Richard Partington: The early signs from the British economy are not looking good as the coronavirus causes mass disruption. According to the consultancy Capital Economics, the number of people dining out plunged by 91% on a year earlier on Wednesday, cinema ticket receipts were down 56% to just \u00a35.6m last weekend, and retail sales were down 11% last week compared to a year ago. Given the scale of the crisis, analysts reckon it\u2019s pretty obvious the economy is already shrinking. But it will be several weeks before official figures confirm the extent of the damage. These early indicators give a bit of a sneak preview - and it doesn\u2019t look good. Capital Economics forecast a 15% drop in GDP in the second quarter - a level unprecedented in modern history \u2013 GDP fell by 6% in the financial crisis and 8% in the Great Depression. The hopes are the plunge won\u2019t last as long as either of those two episodes. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at the consultancy, says: \u201cWe know that these indicators are going to get worse. Their real value will be showing us how quickly the economy is getting back to normal after the virus is under control. We expect the recession will be short-lived and the recovery will be fairly fast.\u201d The International Monetary Fund has posted a blog on China and the impact of Covid-19. There are some positives: While there are reassuring signs of economic normalization in China\u2014most larger firms have reported reopening their doors and many local employees are back at their jobs\u2014stark risks remain. This includes new infections rising again as national and international travel resumes. Even in the absence of another outbreak in China, the ongoing pandemic is creating economic risks. For example, as more countries face outbreaks and global financial markets gyrate, consumers and firms may remain wary, depressing global demand for Chinese goods just as the economy is getting back to work. Therefore, Chinese policymakers will have to be ready to support growth and financial stability if needed. Given the global nature of the outbreak, many of these efforts will be most effective if coordinated internationally. You can read the full blog post here. Oxford Economics has updated its forecasts for the UK economy, taking into account the social distancing measures announced by the government. The research group now expects the UK to fall into a deep recession in the first half of 2020, with gross domestic product shrinking by 1.4% in 2020 as a whole (the economy grew by 1.4% in 2019). It adds: The subsequent rebound in activity should be strong, as the resumption of discretionary spending is supported by low oil prices and monetary and fiscal stimulus. We now expect GDP growth of 3.7% in 2021. However, there is huge uncertainty around the duration and impact of social distancing measures. Our downside scenario, involving a further worsening of the outbreak and financial stress, sees GDP falling by 2.5% this year. Here is our full story on Wetherspoons: My colleague Jillian Ambrose reports: US President Donald Trump has set out plans to stem the flood of oil into the global market by offering to spend $3bn buying up US oil to hold in the US government\u2019s \u2018strategic petroleum reserves\u2019. Trump said he might also be willing to meddle in the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d. Trump\u2019s promised barrel buying spree, a tactic last used by the US in the 1970s, has already offered some respite to global oil markets after one of its steepest declines in history. The US oil price climbed from lows of just over $20 a barrel earlier this week to $27 a barrel, while the international benchmark - Brent crude - climbed from 17 years lows of $25 a barrel back up to $30 a barrel. However, analysts warn that support from the US, and other economic interventions from governments around the world, will not be enough to repair the growing imbalance in the markets. Goldman Sachs said that the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus could cut the world\u2019s demand for oil by around 8 million barrels of oil a day meaning the US actions would be \u201cmuch too small to offset the impact on the market over the longer-term\u201d. US markets are expected to rise when Wall Street opens, with futures showing gains: Dow Jones: +3.7% S&amp;P 500: +3.2% Nasdaq: 4.6% Additional measures from the US Federal Reserve propped up Wall Street on Thursday and expectations that the central bank will do more is helping sentiment. US markets - like those in Europe - have been hammered over the past month as the escalating coronavirus crisis spooks investors. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen by nearly 30%, or more than $8tn, since hitting a record high last month. Tesco has outlined some of the measures it is taking to help its staff and suppliers during the coronavirus crisis. The UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain is closing its cafes and asking vulnerable staff including those pregnant and over 70 to take 12 weeks of paid holiday in its latest measures to support trading during the coronavirus outbreak. The retailer is also setting aside the first hour of trading on Sundays at its large stores for NHS workers, asking them to bring ID with them. For the next three months, the retailer\u2019s smaller suppliers will also now be paid in five days rather than a fortnight in a bid to help them with cash flow. Those staff who are sick or in self-isolation will get full pay and Tesco said that staff needing to take time out to care for children as a result of school closures would be able to use a variety of different options to cover leave including paid holiday, emergency leave and new unpaid school closure leave. M&amp;S and Wetherspoons are not the only companies to issue statements today on Covid-19. My colleague Sarah Butler reports on Just Eat and Wickes owner Travis Perkins: Food delivery firm Just Eat is launching a \u00a310m-plus package of support for restaurants over the next 30 days. The company said it would be handing back a third of all commission paid by independent restaurants, removing commission on orders which customers collect themselves from restaurants and waiving sign-up fees for new restaurants. It will also begin paying restaurants weekly and relaxing any restrictions on independent restaurants working with other delivery partners Andrew Kenny, UK Managing Director at Just Eat said: \u201cThese are some of the most challenging times the restaurants we work with have ever been through. We want to show our support and help them to keep their doors open.\u201d Travis Perkins has suspended its dividend to shareholders and paused the demerger of its Wickes DIY chain as it said it expected the trading environment to change \u201cquickly and materially\u201d in the coming weeks. The building supplies group said sales rose by 2.4% in the year to date and it had not see a significant sales impact from the coronavirus so far but was taking \u201cprudent decisions in order to successfully navigate this period of turmoil.\u201d It has withdrawn market guidance on profits for the year. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says the rebound in European markets is a \u201cwelcome change of pace\u201d after a period of heavy selling: It would appear all the various measures taken by governments and central banks recently is finally calming the markets down. Wall Street closed higher last night and the optimistic feeling was then passed on to Asia, where indices gained ground. This morning it was reported that Germany are looking to put together a \u20ac500 billion rescue package, and that has added to the bullish mood. The pound\u2019s revival means that it has climbed above 1985 lows agains the dollar. Kenneth Broux, currency strategist at Societe Generale, says the intervention from the Bank of England on Thursday was well-timed: It\u2019s been extraordinary. The pound is acting more like an emergency markets currency. Tuesday was panic stations and we had a big blow out in gilts. Investors have been liquidating all types of investments just to drum up cash (in dollars). A lot of investors were terrified by the chance of sterling falling even lower and deeper losses. The Bank of England\u2019s action was very timely. It\u2019s not about the rate cut, more about restarting quantitative easing. The Competition and Markets Authority has launched a Covid-19 taskforce to tackle the excessive prices being charged by some people for in-demand products such as hand sanitiser. It will identify \u201charmful sales and pricing practices\u201d as they emerge and \u201cwarn firms suspected of exploiting these exceptional circumstances \u2013 and people\u2019s vulnerability \u2013 through unjustifiable prices or misleading claims.\u201d So this is designed to tackle traders who might have bulk bought items such as loo roll with the intention to resell them at a higher price to take advantage of the higher demand. The CMA has already contacted traders and platforms regarding excessive pricing of hand sanitiser, it said. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said: This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable. We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the COVID -19 outbreak. But if they do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible. We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers. We hope that such action will not be necessary, but we will do whatever is required to stop a small minority of businesses that may seek to exploit the present situation. Responding to suggestions that he should not be issuing pronouncements on how to deal with coronavirus, Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin said he was entitled to make public statements on the outbreak. \u201cWe\u2019re a democracy aren\u2019t we? I\u2019m obviously not an expert, nor am I an economist, but i\u2019ve got a view and that\u2019s all I can say. People can accept it or not. Even if you\u2019re not an epidemiologist you can look at what other countries do and weigh up what\u2019s happened.\u201d The pub chain has said its 870 UK pubs will stay open but with precautions in place, such as no standing at the bar, frequent surface wipedowns and customers asked to sit far apart from each other where possible. But Martin warned that a long-term shutdown could be terminal for any pub company. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve got the greatest pub company in the world, you depend on the doors being open. If they shut for long enough the entire hospitality industry, never mind Wetherspoons will be in serious trouble.\u201d JD Wetherspoon has seen a significant change in customer behaviour since the prime minister Boris Johnson advised people to stay away from pubs and restaurants in an attempt to slow the spread of Covid-19. The pub group, which operates 874 pubs, said its sales declined 4.5% in the week to Sunday 15 March. Sales then declined at a \u201csignificantly higher rate\u201d after Johnson\u2019s warning on Monday, Wetherspoon said. Shares are up 27% this morning at 715p, as investors welcomed the pub chain\u2019s decision to cut its dividend and cut capital spending - measures which it said (when combined with the government\u2019s business rates holiday) would provide sufficient liquidity to \u201cmaintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales\u201d. Jaguar Land Rover and Bentley Motors have become the latest British carmakers to suspend production at their UK factories as the disruption from the coronavirus outbreak spreads. JLR and Bentley both said that production at their plants will not start again until 20 April at least, with the restart dates under constant review. Almost every major carmaker around Europe has paused production, in response to an expectation of massively reduced demand in all key markets, and the health implications for their workers all factors. JLR, which is owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is the UK\u2019s largest manufacturer of cars, with 35,500 UK employees. The closure affects its main car assembly sites at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Halewood, as well as engine manufacturing at Wolverhampton. Non-manufacturing employees will work from home. Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, said that some \u201ccore operations\u201d will continue in its plant in Crewe, with social distancing measures enforced among its 4,500 employees. More action from the Bank of England this morning, this time relating to banks. It has cancelled this year\u2019s stress tests and said it may be hard to implement new global capital rules at a time when banks are being asked to step up support of businesses and households in response to Covid-19. Announcing the decision, the Bank said: The recent 2019 stress test showed that the UK banking system was resilient to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies that are more severe overall than the global financial crisis, combined with large falls in asset prices and a separate stress of misconduct costs. The pound is up sharply this morning, as optimism builds about a package of measures to protect jobs and wages as well as progress in coronavirus testing. Sterling is up 3.3% against the dollar at $1.1867 One pound is is worth \u20ac1.0993, up 2.4% The rise is all relative of course.. earlier this month the pound was worth above $1.30 and \u20ac1.16. Here is our full story on the warning from M&amp;S, which warned on profits and said it may have to close some stores temporarily as a response to Covid-19. Train services across Britain will be reduced from Monday as people are urged not to travel in order to slow the spread of coronavirus. Passenger numbers have already dropped 70% since the outbreak started. In London, a reduced London Underground service has already come into effect with the closure of 40 stations, and the axing of the night tube. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: We are taking decisive action to protect the public, which means reducing travel for the time being, whilst still ensuring key worker heroes can get to their jobs to keep this nation running. For passengers in crucial roles, including essential workers in our emergency services and NHS, alongside people who need to attend medical appointments or care for loved ones, these changes protect the services they rely on. Read our full story here: Britain\u2019s bus operators have called on the government to provide \u00a31bn in immediate help to maintain critical services as passenger numbers fall away with the coronavirus. Operators say passenger numbers have already fallen by more than half outside London, with a loss of \u00a350million per week in revenues, even before the closure of schools. While the government had pledged to deliver \u00a35bn in additional funding over five years to the industry, with the importance of bus services having risen up the political agenda before the coronavirus outbreak, bus firms now say they need a first tranche simply to guarantee income and support staff costs to maintain vital routes. Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: \u201cOperators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go. Buses are crucial to keeping workers moving \u2013 and must remain a vital backbone of public transport once this crisis is over. \u201cWe urgently need the Government to help bus workers and their employers now to secure the future of the industry.\u201d Firms collectively employ around 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff, whose jobs are at risk. There is no sea of red in equity markets this morning.. instead all major European indices are higher (following gains on Wall Street on Thursday). However, the FTSE 100 has lost some of its earlier gains and is now up 2.2% or 115 points at 5,269. Elsewhere: Germany\u2019s Dax: +5.5% at 9,081 France\u2019s CAC 40: +4.6% at 4,034 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib: +2.5% at 15,847 Spain\u2019s Ibex: +4% at 6,651 Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600: +3.7% at 299 More on that warning from Marks &amp; Spencer. The company said that while it is not a destination for those consumers stockpiling food and other products, it does expect to benefit as people stay at home to eat instead of visiting pubs, cafes and restaurants. We expect our food business to trade profitably throughout. At this stage we have benefited on a small scale as customers stock up but our heavy bias to chilled and fresh means we are not seeing the forward buying uplift experienced by the major grocers. The significant shift to eating in home should however continue to benefit sales in the months ahead. Although there will undoubtedly be supply interruptions, we do not expect these to be prolonged or financially material. The same cannot be said of its home and clothing business: There will be a substantial impact on Clothing and Home revenue at the very least in the first 3-4 months of the next financial year. Although it is possible that this may ease as we get into summer trading, margins are likely to be severely impacted by the surplus of unsold seasonal stock and probable clearance activity in the marketplace. We are therefore taking all possible steps to defer supply. However, a very large part of our core business is less seasonal year-round essential product and this should provide some scope for carrying forward stock. At this stage we are not assuming a return to normal trading in the Autumn. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer are down about 3% in early trading at 111p - underperforming the wider FTSE 100. The warning from the retailer this morning really does bring home the uncertain path for businesses in the weeks and months ahead due to the coronavirus outbreak. M&amp;S said it is not assuming a return to normal trading in the Autumn. The FTSE 100 is rising in early trading, up 5 % or 256 points at 5,407. Investors have welcomed the latest emergency action from the Bank of England, which cut rates to an all time low of 0.1% and announced \u00a3200bn of additional bond purchases on Thursday. But there is also great anticipation that the chancellor Rishi Sunak will this afternoon announce a package of measures to protect wages and jobs. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of economics, business and markets in the UK, the eurozone and worldwide. Marks and Spencer has issued a warning this morning about the impact of Covid-19. M&amp;S - one of the best known names on the high street - said it has suffered a substantial fall in sales in its clothing and homes business and as a result its forecast for the current quarter are \u201cadversely affected\u201d. It comes as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to announce a package to help protect jobs and wages during the crisis. M&amp;S said in a statement: It is too early to make any reasonable forecast for revenues in the next financial year but we are planning on the basis of a prolonged downturn in demand for Clothing and Home. We are preparing for the contingency that some stores may have to close temporarily. However, our business model of operating parallel Clothing and Food businesses and our strategy to move online including the Ocado joint venture should provide more resilience than some single sector businesses. Marks &amp; Spencer said that while its food business was expected to remain profitable, its clothing and homes business was likely to take a heavy hit in the current financial year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: The final result could be at or below the bottom end of the range of profit before tax of \u00a3440-460m, given probable very depressed trading in clothing and home. M&amp;S are not the only ones warning this morning with pub group Wetherspoons, retail group Frasers (formerly Sports Direct), and estate agent Foxtons among those outlining the impact of Covid-19 on business. Turning to markets, there was some respite on Thursday from the sharp sell-off that has rocked global markets since the escalation of the pandemic. Wall Street followed Europe higher after central banks moved to provide more support to economies. Europe is expected to open higher again this morning: Also today: 9.30am GMT: UK public sector finances data for February 2pm GMT: US existing home sales figures for February Stick with us for all the latest updates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
