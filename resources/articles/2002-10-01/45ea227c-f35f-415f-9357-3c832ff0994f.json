Worthless. They'll be wearing that for most of their working lives. A proper student must dress as though he or she has covered themselves in glue and run through an Oxfam backroom. Baggy, mismatched and liable to produce bemused stares from anyone over 30 is the required dress code. Punctuality A candidate turns up five or 10 minutes early for the interview, with time to settle down and perhaps leaf through some university brochures. Oh dear. A real student sees time not as a linear concept, but rather as a bourgeois construct, specifically dreamt up by the ruling classes for the enslavement of the workers. Hence, a true student should turn up at least three hours late, making no apologies for the delay but rather behaving the whole time as though there was somewhere else they really should be. Should the student take this attitude further and simply not turn up at all, then offer them a place immediately. Interview technique A candidate who appears interested in your institution and asks intelligent questions at the end of the interview, while answering yours with politeness and intelligence. Best explain where the door is, then. The genuine student should stare at the floor or possibly up the skirt of the admissions secretary, while showing no signs of having heard any of your questions. The only natural response to any line of questioning is a heavy sigh and a look of pity bestowed on the interviewer, who really, really shouldn't be bothering with this sort of thing. Family background Working class kid who has hauled him/herself from some sink school on a council estate through hard work and intelligence. Well there's no point in that is there? No chance of fitting in. A true student is a nice middle class kid with a name like Emily or Jasper, who washes out the hair gel and leaves the squat at the end of every term to go home to the family seat in Berkshire. There he/she will have a lovely time with mater and pater, tussle affectionately with the red setters and banter charmingly with the vicar after the Sunday service. Being a student is just a phase, after all. Lifestyle Riddled with acne and capable of holding down 10 pints or a dozen bottles of alcopops. Hopelessly working class I'm afraid, and brought up in a pub or a McDonald's. This won't do, obviously. A nice, genuine middle class student has only really drunk wine or sherry before. The ritual of heavy drinking will take a heavy toll, leaving a trail of vomit throughout the institution. Nasty to see, but a sign of a robust social life, though not constitution. The inability to cook anything other than baked beans is another student myth, broken by the genuine article who can easily rustle up a kedgeree, a spotted dick or any other middle class comfort food, the skills for which were learned by watching cook at work, back in Berkshire. Academic background Dodgy results produced by suspect exam boards cannot, obviously, be trusted. Evidence of hard work over the previous two years may well be produced, showing a dedication to coursework and a fierce interest in the subjects. You can only shake your head in sadness. This will never do. The proper student will have spent a term at a private crammer, catching up on all the work lost due to the attendance of house parties thrown by chums. Those chums will also be on the crammer, which leads to more parties, but this is a vicious circle that those destined for studenthood must overcome as part of their true education. Politics You may be getting the picture now, but the final test is politics. Be careful with this one, it depends when you ask. A true student is, in term-time, a firebrand socialist revolutionary, neither Washington, nor Moscow, but International Socialism. Blair may as well be Thatcher as far as they are concerned and, besides, parliamentary democracy should have been left behind in the 19th century. The true student will, however, have also been at the Countryside March. It was (just) out of term-time so they can indulge in their domestic politics - they enjoy hunting, so long as they catch nothing, and they hate the damage done to rural services over the past decade or so. The failing bus service is one example - cook can be dreadfully late sometimes. Either way, they hate Blair, so there's consistency of a kind. If all else fails, ask yourself: did the father come here? Can he afford to buy you a new library? And what does that pretty young thing look like they'd do for a pass grade?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
