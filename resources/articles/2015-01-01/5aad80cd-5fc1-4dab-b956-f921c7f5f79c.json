It\u2019s all a bit Formula One though isn\u2019t it? However, whatever you think about it, Mirallas definitely wouldn\u2019t have been substituted had he scored. Cue lots of rumours linking him with the exit now \u2013 they\u2019ll mostly be poppycock. He\u2019s got 18 month on his contract too. He\u2019s one of the best players at Everton and without him in the second half, Everton struggled to break West Brom down, even though they had 68% possession. Gareth McAuley and Joleon Lescott were magnificent for West Brom, as was Claudio Yacob screening in front of the back four. Thanks for your tweets and emails tonight. Helped to make the best of a 0-0. Bye! Boos ring out around Goodison Park. No win in six now for Everton, their worst record in the Premier League for four years. Another clean sheet for Tony Pulis. All hail! 90min+4: Foster claims again. Can\u2019t decide if that was another good take or another bad cross. Probably a bit of both. That should be it. 90min+2: Everton don\u2019t even want to score I bet. Refusing to cross it. Baines airkicks on the edge but recovers. Coleman finally pumps it in. Corner. 90 min: Four minutes to be added. Promising free-kick right down the side of West Brom\u2019s penalty area, as Dorrans tugs back Baines. He\u2019s booked, but the resulting Baines free-kick is again, shocking. West Brom survive. Three minutes left! 88 min: More Everton pressure. More good West Brom defending. 86 min: Magnificent claim from Foster as Oviedo delivers a dangerous cross. He held it too, not enough keepers do that, and if he hadn\u2019t come for it, I\u2019d suggest Naismith would have got the better of Baird at the back post. Not taking anything away from Lescott or McAuley, that one good cross highlights how bad the rest of Everton\u2019s centres has been in general tonight. 82 min: Getting a bit scrappy here. Coleman and Baines playing like wingers, which could in itself be dangerous. \u201c\u201cIf Mirallas had scored, it would all be fine,\u201d paraphrases Gavin Reddit. \u201cBut the point is he didn\u2019t score. That\u2019s why you have a designated penalty-taker. He sought glory for himself, which is anathema in team sports, surely, unless you\u2019re Cristiano Ronaldo. I\u2019m only bitter because Baines is on my Fantasy team.\u201d 80 min: Fancy a Barkley long-ranger to win this. Although since Everton brought off Besic, West Brom have had a lot more room in midfield. In a game that is supposed to be cagey near the bottom of the league, both teams appear to be \u2018going for it.\u2019 78 min: A couple of very strange substitutions. Anichebe, who has had a good night, comes off for Ideye. Besic, who has just been booked for bringing down Sessegnon, is brought off for Kone, with Barkley slotting back into central midfield with Barry. I\u2019m not a lipreader, but I don\u2019t think Everton fans are very happy with that change. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a little known clause in Gareth Barry\u2019s contract that no matter how slow and old he is, or how poorly he plays he cannot be substituted,\u201d quips Duncan Smith. 75 min: Lukaku wastes another chance, this time on his right, following the best football of the night from Everton. Stones finds Barkley on the edge with a clever pass, who shifts it right to the oncoming Coleman. The first time pass inside finds Lukaku, who skews it wide. For a \u00a328m player, he\u2019s awfully one-footed. Devastating on his left, if he gets the chance. 73 min: Gareth Mueller has kindly written in: \u201cI have been to see Bosnia play a couple of times and have watched countless Bosnia matches on TV due to marrying into a Bosnian family. And I have to say Besic is a marvellous player, he\u2019s the sort of hard-as-nails-ballet-dancer, that is just as likely to pull of a Pjanic-esque piroret as 2 foot someone where completely unwarrented. \u201cHe has been an understudy and central midfield partner of Pjanic for the past year or two (what a player to understudy) and has really developed while playing in the national team with him. I was so pleased to see him come to Everton, and am sure he is going to be a hit in the Premier League. Martinez clearly feels the same. He is one to watch.\u201d I\u2019m inclined to agree with you Gareth \u2013 was Bosnia\u2019s stand out player at the World Cup in my opinion. Certainly not the finished article \u2013 his decision making is perhaps why Everton are struggling to break West Brom down here \u2013 but he\u2019s only 22 and cost just \u00a34m. 71 min: Sessegnon and Anichebe combine well. The Nigerian international swivelling well on the byline, crossing with his left. The ball goes through Stones\u2019s legs but Jagielka is there to clear. A good cross, but with Berahino off and Anichebe working the \u2018channels\u2019, do West Brom have anyone willing to get into the box? 69 min: Lukaku has had a poor second half. He has slowed up counter-attacks, wasted the one opportunity he has had, and is needlessly caught offside here. Meanwhile Pulis makes a second change: Berahino off (!) and Dorrans on. 67 min: \u201cFor those of us in the USA who are unable to hear our compatriot Sylvester Stallone\u2019s words (sic) of wisdom (sic), could you provide a summary?\u201d pleads Peter McMurry. \u201cDid he yell \u201cyo Everton!\u201d\u201d That I cannot confirm Peter. However, here he is trying to speak Scouse. 65 min: Substitution for West Brom. Sessegnon on for Morrison. West Brom have to get out of their own half here, they can\u2019t survive 25 more minutes of this. 63 min: I would estimate that West Brom have dealt with nearly 20 crosses/corners into their box since the start of the second half. That said, not a single header on goal. Hats off to Lescott and McAuley in that regard. 60 min: Everton with a series of corners, the last of which involves some WWE-style wrestling: Yacob on Naismith. Michael Oliver has a word, which has absolutely no bearing on Yacob\u2019s treatment of the Scot when the ball is eventually delivered. Should be a penalty. 58 min: Free-kick to Everton on the edge. Barry was pulled back by Morrison. Who is going to take it? Don\u2019t worry, Mirallas isn\u2019t on the field. Barkley steps up \u2026 driven low and behind for a corner. Cleared by McAuley. 57 min: Lukaku makes his first incisive run of the night, and shrugs Lescott off, before making a bee-line for goal. However, he is so determined to cut back in on his favoured left-foot that he allows West Brom defenders to recover and block. 54 min: Berahino has switched to the right, with Brunt now on the left. Perhaps Pulis thinks he won\u2019t have to do as much tracking back with Oviedo now on Everton\u2019s left. The game is developing into a pattern. Everton attack. West Brom defend in numbers. Everton cross. West Brom clear. West Brom counter-attack. Everton foul. Everton win ball back. Repeat. 51 min: Oviedo is the latest man to halt a West Brom counter-attack, and he finds himself in the book. He\u2019s been on the field six minutes. \u201cA few games back in an Arsenal game, Santi heading over to take the penalty and Sanchez got there first - and missed. Reminds me of that,\u201d reminds Mary Underwood. \u201cBut Wenger didn\u2019t yank him and he went on to score later in the second half.\u201d 48 min: West Brom counter, with Berahino sprinting into a lot of space on this left-hand side. Barry unceremoniously brings him down. Yellow card, as obvious as you\u2019re ever likely to see. No player has earned more bookings in the Premier League than Barry. 46 min: Looks like a like-for-like change on Everton\u2019s left there. Everton starting strongly. The crowd is revved up. Sylvestor must have delivered a rousing speech. We\u2019ll never know (we might know, soon). Peeeep. Peeep. We\u2019re off again. Mirallas has been substituted. Bryan Oviedo coming on. Presumably it has kicked off in the dressing room. GNev just described disobeying team orders as the worst thing you can do, \u201cworse than going studs up and breaking someone\u2019s leg.\u201d Erm, no. If Mirallas had scored, it would all be fine. I am devastated to announce: there was absolutely no coverage of Sylvester. Instead, here is a football chant about Everton goalkeeper Joel. I can\u2019t remember if I have made this up in my head, or if this actually exists. I think it\u2019s the latter (To the tune of Spandau Ballet\u2019s Gold) Joel! (Joel \u2013 whispered) He\u2019s the best keeper in goal We\u2019ve got the power to know, he\u2019s indestructible Always believe innnn \u2026 believe in Joel! Repeat. Here\u2019s hoping GNev and co don\u2019t bother to analyse that actual football, but instead give an all-singing/dancing breakdown of Sylvester Stallone\u2019s half-time speech, which for those of you that don\u2019t know, is due to occur on the pitch at Goodison Park. And that\u2019s your lot. Frustrating for Everton, as that penalty aside, West Brom have looked solid at the back, if a little unambitious going forward. I smell a 1-0, but it\u2019s hard to know which way, because THAT IS THE FUTURE. Mirallas crashes the ball against the bottom of the outside of the left-hand post, with the ball spinning away to safety. Groans fill Goodison Park. Martinez must be livid, Baines has scored 15 out of 16 penalties in the Premier League. Sylvester presumably readying a Hayemaker in the Everton dressing room for the Belgian. 43 min: Lukaku does his best Anichebe impression to chest the ball down in the box. Lescott nips in to try and steal it, but misses the ball with his foot, stumbles, and hits the ball clean with his forearm. He didn\u2019t mean it, but that\u2019s a definite penalty. Baines will surely take this?! No, Mirallas wrestles the ball of him! Baines doesn\u2019t look best pleased, but eventually retreats. Mirallas to take\u2026 40 min: Anichebe, with one of the most delicious chest trap-passes you\u2019re ever seen, brings the ball out of the sky but Gardner flashes his shot wide. That was a half-chance. West Brom are yet to hit the target. 37 min: \u201cWhen he was banging in 18 or so goals at West Brom, I thought get him back to Chelsea to replace the woeful Torres, or Ba\u2026 FAST,\u201d writes Paul Kerton. \u201cBut do you know what, I think Jose was right. Lukaku should have been Drogba-light, but actually he is light-weight. I hesitate to say useless. Once his 28million quid signing was secured, he has switched off. He is useless at holding up the ball, his first touch is often woeful, he ain\u2019t fast and his goalscoring days seem to be behind him. But then after a sterling performance last year, Everton look like someone has taken their batteries out, or at least switched off their sat nav. Boring football.\u201d It\u2019s true, neither team have yet to make a meaningful save. \u201cI wonder if Sly\u2019s appearance will save the day?\u201d, ponders Des Browning. DON\u2019T WORRY GUYS, HALF-TIME IS JUST EIGHT MINUTES AWAY! 34 min: Meanwhile Lescott, another Everton old boy, is doing a fine job at the back and makes a magnificent block to stop Lukaku\u2019s goalbound shot. The Belgian striker turned Gareth McAuley and unloaded on his right foot, but Lescott got out to him extremely quickly. 31 min: Anichebe, back at the club where he started his career, is doing an excellent job of helping West Brom get up the pitch. He is playing almost solely with his back to goal, but Stones and Jagielka can\u2019t get round him. 28 min: Lukaku is dropping deeper and deeper to receive the ball, not what he wants to do. He\u2019ll probably let Roberto Martinez know about that then. An Everton cross is delivered into the box, and there\u2019s nobody there \u2013 Lukaku still loitering in midfield. The Goodison Park crowd is growing restless. 26 min: West Brom break forward and work it down the left with Berahino. Cross comes in and it comes all the way through to Gardner who jinks inside and unleashes a fierce left-foot shot. Saved by Joel! Oh wait, Gardner was offside, but Joel wasn\u2019t to know that and palmed it clear from only eight yards out. Good save. 22 min: Baines drives forward with the ball, and is halted on the edge by a combination of Morrison and Gardner. Foul. A dangerous position for Baines or Mirrallas. This is not unlike the position that Mirallas scored from against West Ham last week in the FA Cup. Mirallas curls it goalwards, but Foster is able to catch it. 21 min: Besic is a strange kind of player. His role is as a midfield destroyer, but he\u2019s got a trick or two up his sleeve, and Cruyff-turns Lescott on the right. He\u2019s also got a sleeve of tattoos, and one on his neck \u2026 with his name. 19 min: First signs of West Brom coming to life. Anichebe uses his power to hold Stones off, before laying off to Morrison who has acres of space to run into. Wisdom makes an excellent run off his flank into the box but his first touch is poor. If only the right back had got that right, he would have had a clear passage to goal. 16 min: Yacob, Morrison and Gardner are doing good job of shielding any passes into Lukaku but Mirallas but Lukaku play a nice one-two on the edge \u2013 the latter with his back to goal. Yacob is just able to get a toe on it. Cleared. 13 min: Gardner clatters into the back of Barkley with most of the Everton faithful calling for a card. Michael Oliver has a quick word, nothing more. Barkley gets to his feet. He\u2019s OK. 11 min: Baines and Barkley looking like Everton\u2019s chief threat down this left. Nice interplay ending with the latter just inches from latching onto a through ball. 9 min: Round of applause goes up by the West Brom fans in the ninth minute in honour of Jeff Astle, the club\u2019s famed No9 who died 13 years ago today. He scored in that 1968 final remember. 8 min: Everton having all the early running here. Baines tries from range from about 30 yards out but it\u2019s patted down by Foster. 6 min: West Brom are sitting very deep, which allows both Baines and Coleman to play their stuff high up the pitch. Dangerous tactic, especially with Lukaku lurking in the middle. He\u2019ll thrive on it being a game of crosses and knock-downs. 4 min: Naismith has just been described as \u201can honest professional\u201d. Very irksome, that. He\u2019s one of a number of British players (Milner, Henderson, etc) that are actually just very good, and happen to work hard defensively. 2 min: Barkley already managing to find pockets of space in front of the West Brom back four. West Brom haven\u2019t had a kick in the first 90 seconds here. Peeep peeeep. And we\u2019re off. The teams are out, Sylvester has taken his seat. Let\u2019s do this. If Pulis is beaming, it\u2019s good to see Saido Berahino happy again \u2013 I would suggest that despite being an excellent performer this season, a move to a bigger club would stunt his development. The young striker refused to celebrate despite scoring four goals in West Brom\u2019s 7-0 win over Gateshead in the FA Cup third-round match on New Year\u2019s Day. He was all smiles though when he got the winner against Hull. West Brom have struggled to score away from home this season \u2013 just six times in 10 league away games \u2013 you would expect Berahino to be pivotal if West Brom are to win tonight to leapfrog Everton in the table. They\u2019ve won just once at Goodison Park in the Premier League. West Brom might only be two points from those in the relegation zone, but it is certainly encouraging that in Tony Pulis\u2019s first game in charge against Hull, they came away with a clean sheet. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher have been discussing whether Tony Pulis\u2019s task is harder this season than last year when he was at Palace. I would argue: no. You might also like to cast you eye on Pulis\u2019s pose here. Face: unerringly happy, body/arms: pure G. West Brom fans: what have you made of Big Tony so far? And what on earth do you make of that pose? Keep an eye out for Dave O\u2019Donnell, Rocky\u2019s promoter who appears about 30 seconds in. Crikey. Tonight\u2019s teams: Everton 4-2-3-1: Robles, Coleman, Stones, Jagielka, Baines, Besic, Barry, Mirallas, Barkley, Naismith, Lukaku. Subs: Hibbert, Oviedo, Kone, Garbutt, Alcaraz, McAleny, Griffiths. West Brom 4-4-2: Foster, Wisdom, McAuley, Lescott, Baird, Morrison, Yacob, Gardner, Brunt, Berahino, Anichebe. Subs: Ideye, Myhill, Pocognoli, Dorrans, Dawson, Sessegnon, Samaras. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Sometimes a preamble isn\u2019t necessary. Sometimes, a lowly MBM hack doesn\u2019t need to point out the teams\u2019 dismal recent runs of form (Everton: DLLLLWLDL, West Brom: WDLLLWSLLLL) or lamely riffing on the fact that Romelu Lukaku used to be better at a couple of years ago at West Brom when he wasn\u2019t a \u00a328m striker, or alluding to notable previous encounters (In 1968, two months after Alan Ball scored four excellent goals in Everton\u2019s 6-2 thrashing of West Brom at the Hawthorns, the Midlands team beat Everton 1-0 in the FA Cup final, thanks to a wonderstrike by West Brom hero Jeff Astle, which you can see in this video that is so excellent in quality and colour and nostalgia \u2026 \u2026 that one can barely believe it is real). Nope, sometimes all one needs to do to gee up the masses for a spot of Monday night Premier League action is a tweet. Because while the 100,000-strong crowd at Wembley in 1968 had to put up with The Band of the Royal Marines at half-time, Everton are going to be treated to a speech by real-life Rocky and his adorable sidekick/enemy/I\u2019m not sure Tony Bellew during the interval. Look! Yep, that\u2019s right folks. Sylvester is in town, and he\u2019s brought his shirt and trilby and everything, just so he can fit right in with the Goodison Park faithful. He\u2019s not doing this because this is a televised event that will give maximum exposure to an upcoming film that he wants to promote. He\u2019s doing it for the love of the game. He\u2019s doing it because the Premier League Is The Best League In The World\u00a9. He\u2019s the people\u2019s champion. And this is the people\u2019s club, apparently.
