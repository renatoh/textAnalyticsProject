The once-sleepy world of Emmerdale has signed up Patsy Kensit, ex-wife of Oasis singer Liam Gallagher, as the soap's new superbitch. Kensit, whose biggest acting role to date was opposite Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon 2, will play Sadie King, a wealthy beauty who moves to the Yorkshire Dales with her husband. Programme-makers said she would add a \"touch of class\" to the rural soap. \"Sadie King is a sexy, powerful and cunning woman who knows what she wants and makes sure she gets it,\" said a spokeswoman. \"She will dramatically arrive in the village in the spring and her stunning looks and ruthless nature are set to add a touch of class to the Yorkshire Dales.\" Series producer Steve Frost said Kensit's character would be \"the envy of women and the desire of men\". \"We're very excited to have Patsy on board and looking forward to introducing such a great character to the show,\" he added. Kensit, who starts filming in April and will be on screen from May, insisted she was a \"country girl at heart\". \"I can't wait to get started on Emmerdale and I've become an avid viewer. I am a bit of a country girl at heart and it is so exciting to be joining, especially at a time when the show is so strong. The prospect of being watched by over 10 million viewers every night is intimidating but I can't wait to get stuck in.\" Scheming Sadie will follow in the footsteps of Emmerdale's last superbitch Kim Tate, played by Claire King, who left the soap five years ago. Kensit, whose other film credits include Absolute Beginners, Angels and Insects and Janice Beard: 45 Words Per Minute, has also starred in BBC1's Murder in Mind and as a guest star in Casualty. Originally called Emmerdale Farm, the soap started in 1972 and was intended to run for only 13 weeks. It was revamped with a string of outrageous storylines in the 1990s and now airs on ITV1 five nights a week. Spectacular storylines included a plane crash on Beckindale at Christmas 1993 - which controversially coincided with the anniversary of the Lockerbie disaster - and the destruction of the Woolpack in a fireworks explosion in 1998. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
