I do it twice a year, for my wife Jane. Once for Christmas, once for her birthday. For her 30th I went nuts and got her a Cartier watch and a pension plan. Now she looks back on it, she appreciates it. Don't you ever shop for yourself? I enjoy a good suit as my life is about being in a chef's jacket. I like the Savoy Taylors Guild - you always get amazing service. They really take the time to make sure your suit has a beautiful fit. Do you shop for food much? My wife does most of that. We get everything from Waitrose or the local delis in Wandsworth. I like Ditto, which is just round the corner. They have a fantastic counter of bread and yogurts. And we buy the kids a lot of meals out. Where does a two-star Michelin chef take his children? They love Pizza Express, which I think is consistently good. And The Butcher and Grill in Battersea. They get a proper meal, and colouring books. What about cooking at home? Have you spent lots of money on fancy gadgets? No, the biggest part of my kitchen is the bookshelf. I love Delia - it's like picking up your grandmother's recipe book - and Nigella and Jamie. I spend money on knives. It's so important - everyone should have a good set. I use Victorinox. What's the best thing you've bought? My Porsche. I got it five years ago to treat myself. What can't you get through the week without? Pret coffee. I drink a lot of tea and coffee - about eight cups a day. \u00b7 One Perfect Ingredient by Marcus Wareing, published by Dorling Kindersley, is out now, priced \u00a316.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
