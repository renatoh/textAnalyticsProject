After insulting London mayor Sadiq Khan before landing, the president and his wife Melania were greeted by Conservative leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt and went on to Buckingham Palace, where Prince Charles walked them across the lawn to meet the Queen. Jeremy Corbyn has encouraged people to join an anti-Trump demonstration on Tuesday. He said the event offered a chance to \u201cto stand in solidarity with those he\u2019s attacked in America, around the world and in our own country - including, just this morning, Sadiq Khan.\u201d We would like to hear from readers around the UK and abroad about the state visit and, if you are in an area Trump is visiting, to find out the mood where you are. We are especially interested to hear from readers who will take part in any protests, or are planning on being in Portsmouth, where D-day commemorations are being held.
