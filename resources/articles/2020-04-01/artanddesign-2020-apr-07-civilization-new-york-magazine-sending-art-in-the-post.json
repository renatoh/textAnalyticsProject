The New York paper sending you artworks in the post", "bodyText": "In New York in the early 1960s, the pop artist Ray Johnson pioneered mail art, posting drawings and notes to friends, which he invited them to augment. His aim was to bring art out of the galleries, and to use the postal service as an element of the artwork. Now, in 2020, as coronavirus rages through the city, the people behind Civilization \u2013 a singular print publication stuffed full of the musings of random New Yorkers \u2013 are reviving the concept. For $3 (\u00a32.40), which you pay through their online store, they\u2019ll send you a personalised letter. Open the eccentrically stamped envelope and you\u2019ll find a four-page message that starts with your name, and an admission that the writer misses you. Judging by the work-in-progress I\u2019ve seen, the missive then goes on several peculiar tangents including a recipe, a playlist, a dice game, a graph charting the writer\u2019s mental health, a list of medication the writer is taking, the word \u201cquack\u201d interspersed at regular intervals for no apparent reason, and the kind of sex- and drug-related ramblings that characterise the paper. \u201cThe idea initially was to try and give people content that wouldn\u2019t be tied to the virus, some kind of alternate newsletter that could be a distraction,\u201d says Lucas Mascatello, who co-founded Civilization with Richard Turley. \u201cIt seems like the mail is only for garbage and news \u2013 bills, government information, the occasional card or invitation. It\u2019s really exciting to get something special, a letter or anything. I think in our time that alone is a pretty artistic gesture. It was definitely inspired by Ray Johnson.\u201d Over the course of a couple of years, Civilization has published four issues, earning a cult following \u2013 the Japanese fashion designer Junya Watanabe has used its distinctively dishevelled art on some of his clothes. It is in a broadsheet newspaper format, but instead of stories, carefully formatted from section to section \u2013 or indeed any useful information at all \u2013 Civilization jams together a myriad of abject, horny, banal and/or chemically enhanced ponderings from anonymous New Yorkers. This torrent of text is displayed in columns that sometimes escape from their grid format and race to other parts of the page, and is interspersed with drawings, sidebars but \u2013 in defiance of our image-saturated age \u2013 precious few photographs. \u201cIn all newspapers now, you have your arts feed, the business news \u2013 everything\u2019s in verticals,\u201d says Turley (who used to art-direct the Guardian\u2019s G2, before working as a creative director on Bloomberg Businessweek and MTV). \u201cI loved the idea of newspapers being far less organised, with a sense of adventure as you worked your way through them.\u201d It all adds up to a compelling portrait of modern New York, a window into the fears, urges and obsessions of people wedged on top of one another 24 hours a day. But now that New Yorkers have been forced to self-isolate, Civilization has changed too. With the letter, it no longer expresses a cacophony, but intimacy, one person trying to reach another across the divide. These days, that\u2019s what we use the internet for: but Civilization is determinedly print, reviving formats that are close to extinction. \u201cThe whole point is to make that physical connection,\u201d Turley adds, saying that with self-isolation, \u201cthere are no more physical connections any more in our little world, beyond our nearest and dearest if you\u2019re lucky enough to be cooped up with them\u201d. Coronavirus, he points out, has added a layer of anxiety to the idea of physical objects passed from one person to another. \u201cThis idea of a piece of paper going into an envelope and someone picking it up and opening it, it\u2019s almost a bit dangerous. There\u2019s almost a layer of threat attached to it \u2013 it could be virus-infected. But we really liked the idea of tactility. There\u2019s going to be a real absence of it while we keep two metres apart from each other for the foreseeable future.\u201d And not just tactility \u2013 the hope is that the letters will start off an ongoing correspondence with Civilization\u2019s readers. \u201cMore than anything I want the people getting these letters to feel like they can write back, like the thing can live on and evolve,\u201d says Mascatello, a journalist who studied fine art. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really like about Ray Johnson.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love people to write back,\u201d Turley agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a few of these: the next might be a postcard, another might be an interview with someone.\u201d What counts is the participation: at a time of loneliness and fear, reaching out to another human being using the age-old means of ink and paper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
