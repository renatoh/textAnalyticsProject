It opens up a war on two fronts for Mr Byers, who is fighting to keep both his special advisor and his reputation, after backing Jo Moore, his press aide, after she called September 11 \"a good day\" to bury bad news stories. Ms Moore - a former Labour party press officer - was also at the centre of a row yesterday over an alleged dirty tricks campaign to discredit Bob Kiley, the transport commissioner for London. Mr Byers in now locked in acrimonious talks with Railtrack, after a huge City backlash against the collapse of the company, which left investors facing the prospect of holding virtually worthless shares. Railtrack plc is already in administration, but executives are worried that Railtrack Group's finances could soon be \"imperilled\" as well. Railtrack chairman John Robinson and chief executive Steve Marshall were hoping Mr Byers could ease the group's financial plight by making a firm statement on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The Railtrack chiefs want Mr Byers to confirm that the group remains entitled to the first section of the link - from Folkestone to north Kent - which is worth around \u00a3400m. Mr Robinson and Mr Marshall had hoped to see Mr Byers yesterday but the transport secretary indicated that he needed further briefing from officials before a meeting. Mr Robinson said: \"It is of critical importance that the secretary of state resolve without delay various issues regarding the group's retention of CTRL, and our executive team tabled proposals to this effect with Mr Byers' officials on Wednesday. \"If these issues are not resolved immediately, the financial solvency of Railtrack Group will be imperilled with profoundly damaging consequences for Railtrack's shareholders.\" Transport officials are also considering an approach from a German bank interested in helping to fund the rail network.WestLB confirmed it had made a \"preliminary approach\" to the government, although it declined to give details of its interest. According to a report in the Financial Times, transport officials have received approaches from other City banks about raising the billions required. At least one party is thought to be interested in a takeover bid for the network. WestLB considered bidding to take over Railtrack earlier this year, the FT added. A Department of Transport spokesman declined to comment on the interest today, but said Mr Byers would have to agree to any transfer of the company out of administration. The spokesman added: \"He would of course consider any realistic offer which the administrator puts to him.\" Options thought to be on the table from City banks include the issuing of bonds backed by the new rail company's main sources of income, which include track access charges and government grants. Another option is a sale and lease-back of Railtrack's property portfolio. However, one transport analyst said it was still early days for the City's interest in funding the rail network. Jennie Campbell, of Gerrard's stockbrokers, said: \"I'm sure the banks have looked at it, but much depends on government subsidies and that's an uncertainty.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
