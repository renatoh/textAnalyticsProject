Sheer lace shorts and slips, transparent panels, diaphanous long gowns and corset detailing were the key trends watched by a nervous-looking fashion press. Every designer without exception played with the concept of exposure, and front rows were abuzz with worried editors and buyers wondering how this new look would translate to the real world. Would we all be meeting for lunch in six months' time wearing a see-through blouse and a pair of lace shorts? Yasmin Sewell, creative consultant for Liberty, says we shouldn't be worried. She is quite literally \"buying into\" the trend. She says transparency comes and goes in fashion. \"I've never really felt it was something we could sell before. But this time it feels commercial enough, interesting enough \u2013 a transparent arm or shoulder is sexy, and it's easy to layer.\" She pauses. \"I think it's going to work.\" Of course, by the time these spring/summer collections appear in shops some pieces will have acquired linings or slips to make them more commercial. But we can still expect cut outs, sheer or mesh panels and tops with bra detailing to feature heavily. It probably isn't going to be a season for the shy. Prada \u2013 always a catwalk to watch for those interested in predicting major trends \u2013 embraced the look. After autumn/winter's 40s skirt suits and over-the-knee waders, last week's show marked a complete change of direction. Miuccia Prada claimed \"a passion for knickers\". These, in white cotton, shone beacon-like through clear crystal dresses. Even the shoes and bags (in Perspex) were transparent. Elsewhere, Jil Sander, designed by Raf Simons, screened a 70s porn film while models paraded raw-seamed, sheer clothes and dresses that looked like fishermen's nets. Donatella Versace stayed loyal to the brand's DNA with super-short dresses in acid bright colours or long gowns slashed every which way. Frida Giannini, at Gucci, updated the little black dress with cut-outs under arms, mesh panels and harnesses that looked part extreme sport and part bondage. It would be easy to suggest that the predominance of slim, filmy fabrics was a response to economic recession, but in fact, in most cases these materials are more costly to produce (the lace at Dolce &amp; Gabbana was expensively intricate). It may be that this new direction reflects a broader political mood. With summer headlines having been dominated by MPs' expenses here and the Silvio Berlusconi scandal in Italy, transparency seems a timely theme. Or, who knows, perhaps designers simply want us to buy more of their clothes to layer up in order to make them opaque. Either way, this is a trend that lends itself to the homemade. All you need is some presentable lingerie, a few undone buttons \u2013 and a lot of of nerve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
