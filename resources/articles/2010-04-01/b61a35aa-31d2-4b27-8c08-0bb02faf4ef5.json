Certainly no expense was spared for the launch yesterday. Battersea power station was hired to provide an ambitiously theatrical backdrop. The manifesto itself is a hardback book, printed on heavy paper, setting an extravagant new benchmark for such productions. All in all, this was unmistakably the campaign launch of an extremely confident, focused and prosperous party. The 120-page manifesto is equally unmistakably the programme of a party which has thought about itself afresh. Compare yesterday's effort with the 2005 Tory manifesto and the contrast goes far beyond presentation. In 2005, the Tory manifesto was the familiar right-wing prospectus from an out-of-touch party, emphasising the usual Thatcherite mix of low taxes, more police, immigration controls and school discipline, aimed at energising the core vote in an election the party expected to lose. Five years on, despite some depressingly inert thinking on Europe and the Human Rights Act, the new manifesto is a liberal Tory prospectus from a party which wants to capture the centre ground in an election it believes it can win. It is a document which, for example, puts environmental protection and climate change \u2013 mere afterthoughts in the 2005 manifesto \u2013 at the heart of the Conservative offer while relegating crime and immigration \u2013 so dominant five years ago and at most elections in the past 40 years \u2013 to a less central place in the party's concerns. How far these new priorities are shared across the party is an important proviso, but open-minded voters should recognise that Mr Cameron has brought a change for the better. Those who rush to shout \"same old Tories\" at some parts of Mr Cameron's offer should be cautious too. You do not have to buy in to everything that Mr Cameron says about his \"big society\" idea for providing better government through the empowerment of the small platoons to recognise both that this is interesting new political thinking, that it addresses an overmighty and inefficient central state about which no liberal should be indifferent, and that it is essentially optimistic about society's capacity to address problems which have otherwise proved intractable to what Mr Cameron calls out-of-date centralist approaches. Those who feel strongly that Britain needs a more active democracy should acknowledge that this is in many ways a compatible view of social activism. This is not to embrace or reject Mr Cameron's approach, nor to dismiss anxieties that it could serve as a cover for the cuts agenda. But it is to acknowledge that it is worth taking seriously as the campaign evolves. It is hard to be generous about the Tory manifesto's two most glaring failings. Faced with the detritus of the largest financial collapse of the past 80 years, the Conservatives have little coherent to offer. Some reasonably strict constraints on the City and on bank profits coexist in the Tory manifesto with the gut conviction that the economy is in general over-regulated and business overtaxed. There is barely any recognition that the economic crisis of the past two years poses fundamental questions about the kind of economy Britain should seek to become, much less of what the Conservative answer might be. And, while the Tories have unquestionably recognised that the expenses scandal triggered a wider crisis in politics, it is unacceptable that Mr Cameron should yesterday have dismissed any thought of reforming the electoral system for the House of Commons or the composition of the House of Lords. Instead, Mr Cameron seems set on changes in lawmaking for England and alterations to the electoral map which are explicitly designed to entrench Tory partisan interests. There is much to chew on in the Tory manifesto. Much to return to as the campaign unfolds. But there is also too much that sticks in the throat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
