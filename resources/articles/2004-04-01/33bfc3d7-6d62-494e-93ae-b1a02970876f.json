Their first win arrived at the right moment: a derby victory that Kelly said would appease their fans was accompanied by some resolute defence to banish the accusations his side are fat and unfit. When the hooker Shane Millard ducked over from dummy-half with 24 minutes to play, giving Widnes an eight-point advantage, it seemed unlikely to be enough, let alone the last score, and an emotional Kelly admitted he had doubts. \"I don't think mentally we've been tough enough so far,\" he said. \"Sometimes if you think you're tired, you are tired. It's a lot like a boxer on the ropes, you've got to pick yourself up and keep going.\" But with their inspirational half-back Jules O'Neill offering what the Warrington coach Paul Cullen said was a \"kicking masterclass\", Widnes's grinding defence ensured a first defeat for Warrington at their new home. Cullen reckoned the result fair and described his side as lethargic and uncommitted. \"We deserve what we got, which was nothing,\" he said. \"We simply didn't want to win as much as they did.\" That was clear from the relief etched on Kelly's face as he talked frankly about how jobs had been on the line. His side grew in spirit as the game progressed. They allowed Warrington a straight-forward opening try after five minutes, when J\u00e9rome Guisset romped through a chasm, but that was a blip. A well-taken try from Chris Giles and a second from Simon Finnegan had Widnes 12-6 ahead and only Guisset's second try - he had a third disallowed - enabled Warrington to be level at half-time. But Widnes were back ahead three minutes into the second half, with their debutant wing Nicky Royle racing 70 metres to jubilant celebrations. Though Danny Lima crossed for Warrington after the exceptional Guisset was held short, Paul Noone missed his first conversion to leave Widnes still in front. Then Millard's extravagant dummy took him across and Kelly could finally savour victory after six rounds of toil. \"Now we've got it [a win] we realise how much it meant to us,\" he said. \"Now we've done it we'd like to think we're up and running - but it's just two points.\" Kelly said Widnes would have to get their feet back on the ground quickly and, with the Hull coach John Kear watching here, his side will be fully prepared for the rejuvenated Vikings on Monday.
