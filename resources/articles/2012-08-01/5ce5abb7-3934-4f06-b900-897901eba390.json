Liverpool have rejected a \u00a320m bid from the Premier League champions for their stylish defender, who they value at around \u00a327m and who manager Brendan Rodgers, despite insisting he wants to keep the 27-year-old, has conceded could be sold for a \"ridiculous offer\". Agger has two years remaining on his current contract but unlike Martin Skrtel, his defensive partner who is in an identical position, is not close to signing an extension. Rodgers is keen to strengthen his squad before the Premier League opener at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday and, as well as a long-standing interest in Clint Dempsey, is pursuing a loan deal for Nuri Sahin of Real Madrid. He is also keen on the Barcelona forward Cristian Tello. City are reluctant to raise their \u00a320m offer for Agger and speaking in Denmark, where he is preparing for Wednesday's friendly international against Slovakia, the Liverpool defender claimed he had no wish to leave Anfield. \"I'd rather stay,\" he said. \"I can't imagine playing for any other club in England but you never know if the club think it's better to sell me.\" Agger added: \"I know there has been interest from Manchester City, but I don't know what Liverpool are responding to it. I am fine with my situation. The club will have to find out what they want to do. I've heard nothing from them. I'd rather stay but that decision is not up to me at the moment. \"Yes, Liverpool can do a deal even though I have two years on my contract. But no, I haven't changed my mind on the subject. Some times you can end up in a position where it's not your decision. I don't want to be somewhere I am not wanted but I would prefer if they want me to stay. That is my first priority.\" The defender's extensive tattoo collection now includes the words of the Liverpool anthem, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", but he explained: \"The tattoo doesn't have anything to do with the current situation. It's a gesture towards the Kop, the club, the people around the club, the city.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
