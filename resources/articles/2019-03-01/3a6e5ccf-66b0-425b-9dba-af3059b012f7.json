By the time everyone is done in Cardiff, they will surely need it. The fans there had two good reasons for drinking on Saturday evening, which is two more than they really needed. The Irish were at it because they had a day they wanted to forget, the Welsh because they had one they never will. It was as if the city was hosting a wake in one room and a wedding in another. In the end 25-7 was not quite a record score. Wales had won by more four times before but, hell, there cannot have been many games that played out so one-sided when the teams had seemed so evenly matched and had so much at stake. Ireland\u2019s seven came in overtime, after the clock was red. Even then, when the game was won, Wales made them fight for that bare consolation as if their lives depended on denying it. Even while Jack Carty was lining up the conversion, which was sure to be the last kick of the game, Alun Wyn Jones was shouting orders at Aled Davies because he wanted him to move two yards to his left. And when Carty stepped up to the tee, Jones sprung on to the balls of his feet, and launched his team into a last desperate charge to try to stop him making a kick that was not going to make a whit of difference whether it went over or not. Jones should not have been able to walk at this point, much less run. He played most of the game on one good leg after he caught his left knee in a collision with Cian Healy in the opening minutes. Jones was left screaming in pain, which, coming from him, seemed a sign of just how serious it was. The doctor plopped an ice pack on it while Jones weighed whether he would be able to play on or not. Wales had only just lost George North, who had gone off with an injured wrist, and that had forced them into rearranging themselves by moving Liam Williams to the wing, Gareth Anscombe to full-back and bringing on Dan Biggar to play fly-half. Even without all that, Jones was the last player they could afford to lose now. Wales\u2019s style is marked by their good game management, and Jones, of course, is the manager. So long as he could walk, he would play \u2013 and play brilliantly well, too. The stats show he made 16 tackles and seven carries but such numbers say so little about what he really did. There is nothing in them, say, about how he caught Conor Murray with a tackle so hard it seemed to check the momentum of an entire counterattack at the very moment Ireland were surging towards the corner searching for the score that would bring them back from 10-0 down. Nothing, either, about how Jones shouldered the responsibility of doing the catching in the lineouts, or how he started the second-half by winning a turnover that told Ireland, and everyone else, all about how the next 40 minutes were going to be just as frustrating for them as the first had been, or how calmly he handled Angus Gardner, even while, on the other side, Rory Best was shouting at him and Johnny Sexton cursing him because Ireland were so unhappy with the way he was refereeing the game. When Best went off there were still 15 minutes to go and his team were 22-0 down. It was a sorry way to finish his last Six Nations game. Jones is 33 and one wonders how much longer he will go on himself. This was his 126th match for Wales, which is not quite a record, and his 63rd victory, which is. He has grown into the finest, most formidable, captain any Six Nations team have had since Martin Johnson finished playing for England. He may yet become the first since Johnson to lift the World Cup, too, because Wales, just like England in 2003, have become a team who seem always to find a way to win. They are on a run of 14 in a row and this spring have done it by racing into a lead against Ireland and clawing one back against France, by overtaking England and by holding off Scotland. After that charge Jones ran on, alone, out in front of everyone else. His teammates had already stopped to celebrate but Jones did not shout about it or even raise a smile, instead he sighed and looked up at the sky, then turned to the nearest Irishman, Jacob Stockdale, and patted him on the back. Gatland has a debriefing meeting planned for Tuesday morning. He has cancelled it, he said, because he wanted to give everyone a chance to enjoy themselves. Jones will, along with every other Welsh person, and then, no doubt his mind will turn to the next challenges. The Grand Slam is won. But there is still serious business to be done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
