Now, for the first time in their history they are in the semi-finals after they beat Montpellier 3-1 on the night, 5-1 on aggregate. Two goals from Fran Kirby and one by Ramona Bachmann secured a scoreline that was not quite as convincing as it looked. Chelsea were certainly made to scrap for the victory by a Montpellier side who attacked with purpose but found a doughty defence, marshalled by the excellent Millie Bright, in their way and refusing to budge. The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, was a coach at Arsenal when they won this tournament, then known simply as the Uefa Women\u2019s Cup, in 2007. Now she leads one of two English teams in the last four, after Manchester City had booked their place by thrashing Link\u00f6ping earlier in the day. \u201cFor so long we\u2019ve been told that English clubs can\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s about the French and German sides, but this is a proud day for Chelsea and Manchester City,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer second-class in Europe.\u201d Hayes said she demanded a fast start and that is exactly what she got. By the fourth minute they had added to their 2-0 lead from the first leg after Kirby, who Hayes described as \u201cthe best English attacker by a country mile\u201d, intercepted a groggy pass from Sakina Karchaoui deep in the Montpellier half and sped through on goal. \u201cIt\u2019s probably every striker\u2019s worst nightmare when you\u2019ve got so much time,\u201d Kirby said. If she was having nightmares, it did not show as she tucked a neat finish into the bottom corner. Aside from that strike, Montpellier were the more threatening side in the early stages. Chelsea keeper Hedvig Lindahl made a few solid saves, Val\u00e9rie Gauvin skimmed a shot just past the post and Katie Chapman had to head off the line following a corner. Hayes\u2019s side were in the curious position of being ostensibly comfortable in the tie but looking vulnerable in the game. Montpellier did find the net in the 37th minute. The former Chelsea midfielder Sofia Jakobsson collected the ball on the right of the area, looked around for options then hit the ball almost for lack of anything else to do. She will presumably claim it was a shot, it could have been a cross, but it was certainly a goal, looping over Lindahl and into the net. The French side started the second half on the front foot again but five minutes after the break Chelsea regained the lead on the night, Kirby threading a perfect pass through to Bachmann, who guided the ball nervelessly into the corner. Chelsea required more hearty defending thereafter but made the tie safe with 13 minutes left. Ji So-yun jinked into the area, was taken down by Linda Sembrant and Kirby tucked the penalty away, fully earning her standing ovation when she was taken off a few minutes later. There is a friendly rivalry between Chelsea and City \u2013 Hayes said she would text congratulations to their manager Nick Cushing \u2013 but the possibility of them reprising their domestic duels in Europe is a delicious one. \u201cIt\u2019s massive that two English teams have made it through,\u201d said Kirby. \u201cHopefully it\u2019ll be a Chelsea v City final.\u201d First though, it is Wolfsburg in the semi-final, no small task given the Germans have knocked them out of Europe in the last two seasons, while City take on the holders, Lyon. Not that they seem cowed by that. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them, so let\u2019s go, let\u2019s bring it on,\u201d said Hayes, who is expecting twins in June. \u201cHopefully I don\u2019t give birth pitchside.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
