As if to mark this great occasion Fred Trueman made an impromptu comeback on Test Match Special yesterday and he was soon capturing the gathering excitement across the nation with such observations as \"I don't know why they try to kill batsmen these days - in my day, we used to bowl them out\" and \"They've got a man there - what do they want a man there for?\" Fred's inspiring grumbling failed to capture the merits of an England attack that bowled with deliberation on a sedate pitch, although Steve Harmison did come close to maiming Justin Langer early in the day and would have hastened England's cause had he done so. Langer has many attributes of a fine defensive batsman, being small, a man of furtive glances and, to England minds at least, a perpetual irritant. However, valiantly as the quicker men strove, England's stability owed everything to Ashley Giles, whose denunciation of critical media coverage had brought retaliatory allegations that he was therefore becoming dangerously unstable. Yesterday he proved this a nonsense - one of the most important design factors of the wheelie bin being that they are not as easy to push over as you think. When Giles's probing left-arm slows claimed Ricky Ponting, who had batted with terrifying assurance, England were so intent on expressing their support that they did not so much congratulate him as engulf him in something akin to a hippy tree-hugging session. Fred used to make do with a firm handshake and a knowledgeable nod. If, in some ways, we yearn to become a more sensitive, touchy-feely country, the opposite is also true - we have also become a more antagonistic one. Visiting supporters have been shocked by the truculence of this Edgbaston crowd, which cheers an Australian only when he misfields or is hit on the helmet and which no longer disguises its desperation for England to regain the Ashes. It is taken as read that Australian cricketers are wonderful; no one sees the need to keep telling them. For much of the past 20 years, cheering Australian mishaps would have demanded that they were watched in total silence but England, even in defeat at Lord's, have proved they are no longer infallible. The few times that Australia have been put under pressure in their great years, Gilchrist apart, they have had a tendency to wobble. That England's first- innings lead was considerable, but never comfortable, was down to Gilchrist. When his face appeared on the big screen around tea time, as the next man in, an Orwellian shudder went around the ground. He averages 53 in Tests, but more than 70 when Australia are up against it, and every English supporter here would have accepted his unbeaten 49 rather than the blitzkrieg they feared might suddenly materialise. The last time England began an Ashes Test by scoring 400 was in Perth in 1986-87, the milk-and-honey series in which they last won the Ashes. As omens go, it is at least a cricketing one, which is an improvement; until now, comparisons between then and now have involved Prince Charles getting married and Liverpool winning the European Cup. This Test, and the one that follows at Old Trafford, will prove pivotal - and the reason for that remains the injury to Glenn McGrath. He had been driven to the hospital yesterday by Keith Piper, who is working as a Warwickshire odd-job man while he serves his ban for testing positive for cannabis. Just the man to dare to tell McGrath: \"Chill out mate, it's only the Ashes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
