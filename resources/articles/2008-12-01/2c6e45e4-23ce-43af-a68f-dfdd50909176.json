Three documents, including a draft of King's first major speech against American involvement in Vietnam and another found in the pocket of the suit he was wearing when he was shot, were withdrawn from auction in New York following objections from the King estate. Belafonte had said he intended to give the proceeds to charity. Hours before the sale today the estate, which has been criticised for trying to profit from King's papers, issued a statement condemning the auction and saying that it believed the documents had been \"wrongly acquired\" by Belafonte. \"The King estate contends that these documents are the property of the estate of Martin Luther King Jr,\" the statement said. \"Mrs Coretta Scott King [King's wife]and the King estate stopped a previous attempt by members of Harry Belafonte's family to anonymously and secretly auction wrongfully acquired King documents through a Beverly Hills auction house.\" It added that lawyers were \"looking into issues related to the December 11th Sotheby's auction of King documents\". According to the auction house, Belafonte - who became friends with King in Harlem in the mid-1950s - asked that the items be withdrawn from the sale. In an interview before the objections from the estate were aired, Belafonte, a long-time social activist, said that he intended to donate the estimated proceeds of $750,000 to $1.3m to charities for \"the disenfranchised\". \"I am at the end of my life,\" he said, \"I will be 82 shortly and there are a lot of causes I believe in for which resources are not available, and there is a need to redistribute those resources.\" Belafonte said the draft speech on Vietnam was written in February 1967 in a New York apartment he had provided for King. When King went to Los Angeles to deliver the speech, titled The Casualties of the War in Vietnam, he left behind the draft, written on three yellow pages of a legal notebook. Also in the sale were notes for a speech found in the pocket of the suit King was wearing when he was assassinated in April 1968. The notes were given by King's wife to a friend who later gave them to Belafonte, the singer said. A condolence letter from President Lyndon Johnson to Scott King, expressing his sympathy and promising to dedicate law enforcement to finding the killer, was also in the auction. Belafonte said that King's wife had given him the letter. In the speech, King declared: \"I see our country today intervening in what is basically a civil war ... we often feel that we have some divine, messianic mission to police the whole world.\" \"We are in an untenable position morally and politically,\" he told the audience at the glitzy Beverly Hilton hotel. \"We are left standing before the world glutted by our barbarity. We are engaged in a war that seeks to turn the clock of history back and perpetuate white colonialism.\" Relations between the King estate and Belafonte have been strained since 2006. The singer had been invited to deliver a eulogy at Scott King's funeral but the invitation was subsequently withdrawn. The King estate was criticised in 2006 for putting 10,000 items from its collection up for sale at Sotheby's. The sale was cancelled after the city of Atlanta secured a $32m loan to set up a non-profit organisation to buy the papers. They are currently stored at King's former college in the city. King and Belafonte met after the civil rights leader gave a speech at the Abyssinian Baptist church in Harlem. The two, said Belafonte, met for four hours in a basement of the church to discuss plans for the singer to spread King's message."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
