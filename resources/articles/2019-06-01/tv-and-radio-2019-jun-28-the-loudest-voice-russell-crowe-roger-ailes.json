It stretches around Crowe\u2019s forehead and temples to form an oval, and the prosthetic jowls glued on to his jaw frame his face with unmoving latex. It catches the light a little differently in every scene and always makes itself known, like a background extra doing too much business in the hope some casting director might notice. Eventually, it occupies enough space in the show that it starts to resemble the divide between phony artifice incarnate and its referent in reality, a tension that persists through the first four episodes distributed to critics. The whole series feels like one bad hairpiece. A morbid fascination with how the sausage of modern conservatism gets made powered Dick Cheney biopic Vice to a windfall of Oscar nominations earlier this year, and that same liberal impulse to tour the enemy camp motivates Showtime\u2019s new show about Ailes, the man who built Fox News. The series starts with Ailes and shows how he built an empire on dishonesty, underhandedness, hostility, and greed. With deep-pocketed Rupert Murdoch (Simon McBurney) eager to get a piece of the news media industry, Ailes found a benefactor who\u2019d let him run things his way, even if it skirted journalistic ethics before disposing of them completely. Fox News was born with the paradoxical missions of bringing \u201cfair and balanced\u201d commentary to the 24-hour cable game, and doing so by providing an expressly conservative viewpoint. Doublethink, in the fact-bending Fox madhouse, was taught like the five Ws. With the portraiture of Ailes playing so straightforwardly as to risk tedium \u2013 anyone who knows the name Roger Ailes knows he was a moral black hole, and most likely read the sickening expos\u00e9 about his campaign of constant sexual predation \u2013 that leaves the procedural element to keep things lively and moving. Which, for the most part, it does; watching Fox News slither into mainstream recognition, from noisy shit-stirrers to a competitor for the more legitimate likes of MSNBC and CNN, is to watch America shift the goalposts of acceptability. In one standout scene, Ailes\u2019 deputy Brian Lewis (Seth MacFarlane) lays it all out in plain language: run something made-up, force a debate over whether it\u2019s true or false, then sit back and watch trusted outlets like the New York Times report on the conversation rather than directly debunk the claim. Behold, the bloody, screaming birth of fake news as we know it. I\u2019ve gotten word that the back four episodes dig deeper into the direct connection between Ailes\u2019 philosophy of factual elasticity and the ascent of Donald Trump, the other major thread being a more pronounced presence from the women in his life. We\u2019re made to sit by helplessly as Ailes\u2019 flunky Laurie Luhn (Annabelle Wallis) endures his horrible abuses, and then gets herself out by luring an unsuspecting newbie into her same position. It\u2019s ghastly stuff, as is the domineering relationship to his wife Beth (Sienna Miller) and his unending harassment of pundit Gretchen Carlson (Naomi Watts). Yet it\u2019s all but stated out loud that he\u2019ll get his soon enough. Even if this particular story wasn\u2019t common knowledge, it\u2019d still lose all sense of drama by silently reassuring us that these women will have their day. (With the notable exception of Beth, who happily plays pawn to her husband as he purchases their town\u2019s local newspaper and installs her as the editor-in-chief/head propagandist.) Aside from the occasional remorseful stare, the first half of the series glides right by the difficult combination of complicity and victimization they lived with on its way toward a simpler comeuppance. That\u2019s the show\u2019s chief issue in miniature: it cannot reconcile a well-honed expertise on the nuts and bolts of news with its rudimentary understanding of personality and behavior. Sketches of actual people have been inserted into an environment more realistic and detailed than they are, a contrast unflattering to Crowe\u2019s floundering performance. From beneath his protective layer of synthetic blubber \u2013 you know Christian Bale would\u2019ve gained the weight \u2013 he glowers and growls and leers at pencil-skirted colleagues the way a lion looks at a gazelle, but he takes that bluster nowhere. He\u2019s rotted all the way through, a bad guy we can love (and feel informed) hating, though Crowe\u2019s acting reveals nothing that hundreds of articles and the book from which this series was adapted hadn\u2019t already established. Like the rest of the unsavory characters in his orbit, he\u2019s a set of talking points in search of some interiority. In the interest of fairness, however, one could make the argument that this thinly-drawn embodiment of a facile evil is no less human than anyone working at Fox News back in our real world. The Loudest Voice starts on Showtime on 30 June with a UK date yet to be announced"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
