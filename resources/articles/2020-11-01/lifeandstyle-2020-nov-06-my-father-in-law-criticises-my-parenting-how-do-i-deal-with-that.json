How do I deal with that?", "bodyText": "My husband\u2019s parents live nearby and have been a great support since my son was born last year (my family live abroad). They regularly help out with childcare and, despite a few minor differences of opinion, we trust them and are grateful we can rely on them when we need a helping hand. But my father-in-law has become very critical of me. He regularly makes hurtful comments, always aimed at me, even when it\u2019s something involving my husband. Often the comments get laughed off by other people or just ignored. I tend not to respond to them \u2013 I clam up when I\u2019m hurt or embarrassed. I want my son to have a close relationship with his grandparents. My husband has noticed the comments and is supportive. We\u2019ve talked things over and we both agree that his father doesn\u2019t seem to dislike me as a person and doesn\u2019t say these things to be malicious. I don\u2019t remember him making any negative comments about me before our son was born; it\u2019s more about my role as a mother. I work hard to maintain a good relationship with them, despite our differences. I\u2019ve also seen how a disagreement with parents-in-law can make things difficult for the spouse, and I don\u2019t want that for my husband. On some level, I know it\u2019s not really about me or my parenting; I know my father-in-law had a difficult, rather neglectful upbringing himself. I\u2019d appreciate some tips on how to tackle the comments and stop them ruining what is, on the whole, a positive relationship, as opposed to stopping the comments themselves, which is unlikely. I know it\u2019s not up to me to \u201cheal\u201d my father-in-law, but something\u2019s got to give. You sound thoughtful and astute. You asked me not to mention the sort of comments your father-in-law makes, but they are very pointed. There is clearly something about the way you parent that gets under his skin, and I think you are spot on with your suspicion that his own difficult upbringing has something to do with it. However, I wonder if, far from disliking you, your father-in-law actually quite admires you. He clearly wants your attention. It is interesting that he changed after you had your baby, which further reinforces the idea that this is about you as a mother, rather than as a person. Some people find the intimacy between a mother and child threatening. It can tap into unresolved issues within them, often subconsciously. But it\u2019s not fair to aim this at you. The family psychotherapist I consulted, Nicola McCarry (aft.org.uk), said something really interesting: \u201cWhat you believe about a person\u2019s intent [when they say something to you] really impacts on how you feel and respond. So if you think, for example, he\u2019s a mean old man, damaged from childhood, you\u2019re going to receive his comments in a particular way and respond accordingly.\u201d We all do this, and it\u2019s something to watch; it\u2019s very hard to take comments neutrally if you\u2019ve already overlaid them with meaning. I think you and your father-in-law have something in common: you\u2019re not communicating honestly with each other. You clam up, and he\u2019s making barbed comments that are very probably about something else entirely. \u201cYou\u2019re both stuck,\u201d McCarry said, \u201cin a circular pattern.\u201d She also mooted the idea that he may be missing the connection [you had] from before. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have the skills to reflect [on their behaviour] and say, for example, \u2018I really miss our conversations\u2019, and instead start picking at someone to provoke a response.\u201d McCarry suggested to, first, try to see this as coming not from a place of criticism but him \u201ctrying to reconnect\u201d; that may soften your reaction to him. Second, you say he talks \u201cthrough\u201d the baby when he criticises you. Try doing the same: \u201cOh, look how much Grandad loves you, he thinks about you all the time\u201d etc. She also suggested you make sure your in-laws are happy about the amount of childcare they are giving you. I would go further, if you can, and when he next says something negative, ask, \u201cOh, are you feeling left out?\u201d and see how he reacts. Of course, you could ask him straight: \u201cWhy the catty comments?\u201d But while I\u2019m all for directness, sometimes it\u2019s too direct and doesn\u2019t give you the result you want, because it puts others on the back foot. There is a great saying, \u201cIn with anger, out with love.\u201d If you can manage to do it, it\u2019s highly disarming. \u2022 Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.
