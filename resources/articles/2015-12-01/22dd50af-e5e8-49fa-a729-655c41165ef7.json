It had just been put to the Tottenham manager that he had a reputation for bringing through young English players and he jumped in before the question had time to reach its point. \u201cOnly a reputation?\u201d queried Pochettino. \u201cI think it\u2019s action, not reputation. I think it\u2019s the reality.\u201d It is certainly not hubris on his part. The figures justify Pochettino\u2019s pride and they were augmented by what turned out to be a comfortable victory at St Mary\u2019s, won by goals from two of the 10 England debutants to have passed under his charge. Harry Kane and Dele Alli are unlikely to benefit from more charitable defending all season but their contributions in a three-minute spell before half-time took Tottenham into the top four and the broader picture suggests they have a genuine opportunity to entrench themselves there. \u201cWe push them to be brave,\u201d said Pochettino of a team whose average age on Saturday was 24. \u201cIt is difficult to play every game at a good level. They are very young but we are very proud of them.\u201d Kane\u2019s goal, his 30th of the calendar year on his 100th appearance for Tottenham, owed plenty to the courage his manager prizes. Erik Lamela and \u2013 in particular \u2013 Alli both took clatterings when moving the ball along in the buildup and the finish quietened an out-of-form Southampton team that had started brightly. The second half was an exercise in game management for the visitors and Kane believed lessons had been learned from a lax display six days previously, when Newcastle had overturned a deficit to win 2-1 at White Hart Lane. \u201cNewcastle was probably the kick up the butt we needed,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe had drawn a couple of games before that too and maybe we were getting a bit complacent. That maybe woke us up a bit. This was a must-win game for us, I felt. The players knew that. Two-nil away from home at Southampton is a very good result.\u201d The danger for Southampton is that many more offerings of this standard will make that a generous assessment. Ronald Koeman sounded worried afterwards, mentioning more than once a need to \u201cchange our mentality\u201d after a fourth defeat in five Premier League games. Theirs was a fatal mix of the over-committed and the noncommittal when Kane ran through to open the scoring, Jos\u00e9 Fonte having dived in needlessly on Alli some 55 yards up the pitch before Virgil van Dijk, the last man between Kane and Paulo Gazzaniga, unfathomably airkicked at the ball when standing his ground should have sufficed. \u201cWe started well but then we conceded two goals and it was unacceptable,\u201d said their midfielder, Victor Wanyama, whose own influence waned as Tottenham took control. \u201cWe were there for the first 40 minutes but then I don\u2019t know what happened. We need to work together as a team. At the moment I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We need to get clean sheets and score goals but at the moment it is not working for us.\u201d Something is clearly not right and, although you do not see in Southampton\u2019s demeanour the downing of tools that led to Garry Monk\u2019s departure from Swansea, it would only take a poor return from their next two games \u2013 against Arsenal and West Ham \u2013 to create the kind of run that got him the sack. While Tottenham were delighted with the perceptive Kyle Walker cross that created Alli\u2019s goal, Van Dijk had this time been overly cautious in giving him time to pick it out and the scorer, left alone in the six-yard box by C\u00e9dric Soares, could take a touch before finishing almost apologetically. Poor decisions are becoming commonplace. \u201cI believe they have a very good squad and I think it is a negative period. It happens in every team,\u201d said Pochettino, reliably sanguine in sentiment towards his former employers. Could they be drawn into a relegation fight? \u201cMy opinion doesn\u2019t matter. I rate the squad and manager. There is nothing to worry about.\u201d If that was an endorsement, it was still at some remove from the sense he emits that his own team is firmly on the right path.
