Not only is this, in itself, an act of almost criminal vandalism, it is a wilful waste of community resources that other people can make use of. In Birmingham, there is now a project called Books for Change (www.booksforchange.org.uk) that has established a book exchange network where we take donations of unwanted books and give them free to community projects. Homes for the elderly, children's after-school clubs, prison projects and daycare centres all benefit from having books made available for their use. You would be surprised at how diverse the demand for all sorts of fiction and non- fiction can be from those who can't afford to go out and buy them. Sadly, it is our experience that this instance of using skips to dispose of books is by no means an isolated incident. We have stopped at least four major dumpings of books from college and school premises, and I suspect this is only the tip of the iceberg. Books can have viable and important new lives out in our communities, being read again rather than being stored away from sight until they are sent to be pulped. Terry Potter Director, Books for Change As a librarian who weeds rather than hoards, I read the university book-dumping saga with some trepidation. I've cleared books out of four libraries now (FE and school) - literally thousands of old, irrelevant, off-putting, bacon-stained and misleading books, often unaccessed for up to 50 years. I evaluate each one, and would sell the withdrawn books - proceeds to BookAid - or give them to charity shops (which often turn away unsellable books), having contacted departments first. I do throw out books, but as a last resort. The internet has a wealth of information that has made a lot of reference books outdated as soon as they are published. I applaud the bravery of the librarians of Queen Mary - there are too many who want to keep at all cost. And Decline and Fall is available as a Penguin Classic - no need to panic.
