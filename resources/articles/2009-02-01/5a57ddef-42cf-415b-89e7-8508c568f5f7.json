Tony Blair lead the way with BAE", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/05/kenya1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/05/kenya1", "fields": {"headline": "Business as usual", "bodyText": "When Kenyan anti-corruption czar John Githongo announced his resignation in early 2005, there was a reason he chose to do so from self-imposed exile in London. He had realised that the giant scam he was investigating went to the top of his own administration and did not trust the Kenyan judicial system to either bring the perpetrators to book or keep him safe. Yesterday's statement by the Serious Fraud Office shows how right Githongo was. The SFO says it has dropped its probe into Anglo Leasing, a $750m scandal involving a bevy of bogus, foreign-based security companies, because of the Kenyan government's failure to cooperate. \"There is currently no reasonable prospect of conviction without the evidence from Kenya,\" it said. After Githongo went public with what he had learned, naming the ministers, aides and permanent secretaries involved in Anglo Leasing and attributing overall responsibility for the affair to President Mwai Kibaki, the Kenyan authorities launched a torturous face-saving process. The Kenyan anti-corruption commission took evidence from Githongo, investigators flew abroad, police forces in France, Switzerland, the UKand beyond were asked for help. The Serious Fraud Office even sent officers to Nairobi to lend a hand. It was a costly performance which was never intended to produce a result. Systems as endemically corrupt as Kenya's are incapable of investigating themselves. Anti-corruption campaigners often quote the saying \"a fish rots from the head down\". Anglo Leasing, only one in a long series of scandals implicating regimes of the day, perfectly illustrates that point. Basking in presidential favour, those named by Githongo remain at large, part of Nairobi's golf-playing VIP set. If Kenya's already-battered judicial system emerges further discredited from this episode, the British government has no reason to congratulate itself either. When Tony Blair intervened to halt the SFO inquiry into BAE in 2006, he broadcast a unsavoury message to developing governments across the world: whatever we may say in public about zero tolerance for corruption, it's really business as usual. Having noted that the British government blithely ignored due process when a high-profile and sleaze-tainted arms deal of its own was concerned, the Kenyans naturally assumed they could do likewise. And so they have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
