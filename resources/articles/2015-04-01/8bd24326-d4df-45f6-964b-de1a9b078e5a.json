Starting third and fourth in League One, they ended fourth and third after the visiting Dons ran riot with a scintillating second-half display to win 3-0 at the County Ground. With a five-point gap to Preston in second and a six-point gap over Sheffield United in fifth, the spread at the top of this division is greater than that in the Championship. These two could well be on course for the play-off final at Wembley on 24 May. Not that managers, still less fans, tend to see it like this. For months the former through the divisions have rebuffed questions inviting them to express confidence in their chances of this or that with \u201cthere will be lots of twists and turns before May\u201d. The latter, counting anything rather than what Alan Hansen might call stonewall chickens, will work out all manner of improbable scorelines to justify their unease. They have a point, too. Form and fortune are fickle, as Swindon and MK Dons know from almost identical and simultaneous dips. From late January Swindon suffered five defeats in eight games, winning only two. From the start of February MK Dons lost four in eight, also winning two. Each had pulled out of the slump and they met with fresh confidence after successive wins. Indeed they played with an abandon that suggested they did not really expect to catch even Preston, let alone the tearaway leaders, Bristol City, and equally were far enough ahead of those below to risk enjoying themselves. Eventually Swindon also abandoned any semblance of defensive order. As Mark Cooper, their subdued manager, said: \u201cIf you keep turning the ball over, you get in trouble. The longer the game went on [and the Dons kept scoring], the more we had to gamble a bit. Obviously when you concede three goals at home it\u2019s not ideal. At half-time it was an even game.\u201d In terms of chances Swindon had the better then. While their keeper, Wes Foderingham, had to save solidly from Daniel Powell and sensationally from Will Grigg steaming on to Darren Potter\u2019s 40-yard through-ball, they sourced as much down the left, from where Massimo Luongo and Ben Gladwin crossed to a man arriving beyond the far post. At least Nathan Byrne forced a save. But the striker Matt Smith took an age to pick up the pace. Beforehand Swindon, through international calls \u2013 six, no less, for a League One club \u2013 and Walsall\u2019s Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy action, had gone 18 days without a game. After the interval they could not live with the Dons, whose play, flowing with deft touches and switches of direction, had them in a spin. Karl Robinson, almost five years in a job he began at 29, is an admirer of the Dutch ethos that \u201cthe master of the ball becomes master of the game\u201d and, perhaps picking up on the club\u2019s proximity to Bletchley, is playing the imitation game and finding local Englishmen to do it. One of them, Dele Alli, 19 next Saturday, catches the headlines, a midfielder of fine balance for 6ft 2in and now a Spur back on loan. He returned within himself from a six-week ankle injury to pull strings with Samir Carruthers and turn screws with Grigg. They exposed the frailties of Swindon\u2019s three at the back, even with their new loanee, Sam Ricketts from Wolves, as protective shield. Foderingham beat out Grigg\u2019s shot for Powell to nod in after an hour and Grigg signed off high-class moves for the other two goals. \u201cA lot of teams have been up and down,\u201d Cooper said hopefully, and Barnsley bear him out, rocketing from 19th to sixth with six wins from late February before draws with the top two. The Tykes are now one of six sides below the line looking to get above it. Swindon are at Bristol City on Tuesday and Steve Cotterill watched them here. \u201cHe knows we\u2019re a good side and will beware a sting in the tail,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey are more direct than the Dons.\u201d Inevitably there are a host of other top-12 clashes to come but nothing to dim Robinson\u2019s excitement. \u201cThat was our best away performance in years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo beat Swindon home and away is as good as it gets. A usual rule of thumb is that 72 points get you into the play-offs and we\u2019ve done it with seven games to spare.\u201d As for the advantage this win might have on a play-off match, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve put logs on their fire.\u201d It could make a crackling final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
