Shouldn't that, you cry, be Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts? Well, no. I have more often been disturbed and impressed by Ghosts than truly moved. The reach of this 1881 play is extraordinary: inheritance, venereal disease, euthanasia, conflagration, snobbery, feminism. The ferocity with which it attacks not only turpitude but misplaced ideals about marriage and loyalty is tremendous. Bernard Shaw put his finger on it when he said that Ghosts showed the 19th century loathing itself. In a mighty couple of hours, Ibsen once again gave drama a shove into the next century and beyond. Yet Eyre's production is above all profoundly intimate, proving with intensity the stranglehold the past can exert. It is immediately evident that this will be a staging of great suggestiveness as well as resonance. Tim Hatley's design and Peter Mumford's lighting create a solidly realistic drawing room set against a fluid, glimmering, constantly changing background. Shadows and faint figures are glimpsed through transparent screens; a portrait, presumably of the patriarchal ogre, floats like a fly in amber. Ghosts are there from the beginning. The walls flush with fire and close in darkly on the characters. The action moves at a 21st-century lick. Events arrive with the shock of a thriller. \"Oh no,\" cried out a young American teacher, new to the play and riven by one terrible irony. Yet there is also stillness and patience \u2013 not least in the central performance of Lesley Manville. She holds herself as if she were made of porcelain, barely gesturing, until she finally fractures and shatters. Will Keen, at his best when least emphatic as the love-quenching pastor, does wonderful work with his terrible zealot eyes. It's not only that he transfixes with his mad gaze. He cleverly does the opposite, dropping his stare when most drawn to someone. As the stricken son, Oswald, who brings back to the house awful suggestions of his father, Jack Lowden transmits a powerfully physical sense of his condition, moving from a dreadful torpor to an anguished writhing. Eyre has written his own new version of the play, based on a literal translation by Charlotte Barslund. Its clarity and forcefulness are central to the evening's success. It is never over-idiomatic or straining, yet it contains not one stale phrase. Oswald's terror of the future is finely captured in his lament that he is about to turn into \"a grey-haired infant\". A shrewd attention to the speeches of the \"illegitimate\" daughter who is brought up as a maid in her father's house illuminates the horror of her history and makes a tragic heroine of what might be thought a minor part. Well supported by Brian McCardle as her father, Charlene McKenna brings to the part a delicate lack of sentimentality. We are living in a period of marvellous productions of Ibsen: one of the highlights of last year, Carrie Cracknell's production of The Doll's House, is about to go to New York. How things have changed since the premiere of Ghosts, when an orgy of critical denunciation proclaimed it as \"garbage and offal\", \"loathsome and fetid\" and the \"maunderings of [useful vocab] nook-shotten Norwegians\". It's 16 years since the digital world burst on to the stage in Closer. No one who saw Patrick Marber's play will forget the moment when, with the stage dominated by giant computer screens, two characters began to tap out messages to each other. And started to lie about themselves. Their typed-out fibs hung above them like damning headlines. The stage is the ideal place to show the gap between what we tweet and mail and who we are. It's sharp of Brigid Larmour, artistic director of Watford Palace, to commission three plays on the subject. There is nothing as seismic as that Closer moment in the two opening plays. Not simply because familiarity has taken the edge off surprise, but because in neither play is the staging as well as the subject matter seized by digitisation. Neither contains an episode in which the new technology is seen as well as cited. Still, the diversity of the playwrights' approaches makes the case for this mini-season, which is completed by Stacey Gregg's Override. Gary Owen's Perfect Match is an accomplished comedy which takes off from technological possibilities (a dating site) rather than exploring them. It's a frothily neat meshing of new subject matter and old format. EV Crowe's Virgin (the hymen is digital) meanders in the middle but looks at the question of what the internet has done for women (often shafting them) with the perspicacity you would expect from this astute young playwright. I liked the opening shot (bloke with a book, woman with a laptop). I admired the nimble attacks and the description of the househusband who would not call himself a feminist but looks a bit like one since he \"doesn't know how to be unfair\". I loved watching Laura Elphinstone as a gauche, febrile woman burning herself up with anxiety. Nicky Silver's The Lyons was a New York hit in 2011. It comes here with the same director, Mark Brokaw, and a British cast doing sterling, or dollar, accent woik, but it looks peaky. Silver has picked and mixed familiar plot ingredients. A family gathers around the deathbed patriarch: cue strife and secrets. One character has a romantic escape. Another is driven to invent a romantic life. The extent of the vitriol is the main surprise, with its nicely turned causticness: \"This cancer is making you very bad-tempered.\" The most original scene is a diversion from the play's main family-exploding business. An estate agent shows a young man around a New York apartment. The long skinny stage suddenly seems appropriate, made for people to coil and spring at each other. The duplicity and delusion are lively. Weirdly, it made me wish there were more plays about estate agents.
