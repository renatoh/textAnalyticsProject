Asked if he had ever seen a better try at Twickenham than Chris Ashton's second effort in the 35-18 victory, Johnson said: \"I think I scored one, once, from two yards against Italy, which I thought was better than that.\" The try was, Johnson conceded, \"pretty special\". But England's coach said he was not surprised by what his team produced. \"We can play, we know that. We went wide from deep today because that is where the space was and we did it pretty well. We went wide from deep last week against New Zealand as well, but we just didn't quite get the same rewards as we did today, and that's because the guys just executed a little bit better.\" Ben Youngs, who had an electric game at scrum-half, also compared England's play to that produced the previous week: \"Last week we got bits of it really well. We were bitterly disappointed then when we lost to New Zealand but we learned a huge amount \u2013 and, had we won that, maybe we wouldn't have learned so much.\" Youngs was man of the match but was modest about his performance: \"We're all here to play as we do for our clubs, that's why you get selected to play for your country and you've got to back that up.\" Youngs dovetailed with Toby Flood superbly, the two men orchestrating some of the most adventurous attacking play England have produced in a long while. \"I know Floody inside-out,\" said Youngs, \"and vice versa, so it makes it easier but we've got world-class players all over the park.\" Johnson was \"delighted but not surprised\" with the way Flood had played. \"He has matured a lot and now he runs the game superbly well from there.\" As well as his team played, Johnson was never going to let himself get carried away. \"We're capable of it, we know we are,\" he said. \"We have to do it for 80 minutes but we did it for a lot longer than last week. We'll be back in on Monday and we'll work at getting better.\" Australia's captain, Rocky Elsom, said England were \"red-hot\". He and the head coach, Robbie Deans, were quick to admit they had been outplayed by a better team. \"We've witnessed England's progress and we knew they'd be keen to get on,\" Deans said. \"It didn't surprise us at all. It was two tries apiece but clearly England deserved their win. England played very well, they picked up the tempo and played with great initiative.\" \"It wasn't for lack of effort but some of the execution wasn't as sharp as it has been, that's obvious,\" Elsom said. \"We were playing a very good English side and their execution was top notch. That was the difference between the sides. Against a lesser side, it wouldn't have been an issue.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
