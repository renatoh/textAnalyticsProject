In a move that may be interpreted as a pre-election gambit, the Home Office asked the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) to review the position in the light of fresh medical evidence. Charles Clarke, the home secretary, wrote to the ACMD's chairman, Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, asking for advice on the toxicological content of skunk varieties grown hydroponically, which may have a higher potency. The independent committee does not meet until late in May, after the expected date of the general election. It was unclear last night whether Mr Clarke's intention was to prepare the way for a change in policy or to neutralise cannabis as an election issue by providing an answer to Conservative criticism that the government has gone soft on drugs. In the Commons earlier this month, Mr Clarke resisted demands from the Tory spokeswoman Cheryl Gillan to rethink cannabis policy. David Blunkett, Mr Clarke's predecessor, reclassified cannabis from class B to class C in January 2004 - placing it alongside steroids and some prescription anti-depressants. This made many cases of cannabis possession a non-arrestable offence. Arrests for cannabis possession in London halved over the first year of the relaxed regime, the Metropolitan police said in January. In a letter to Sir Michael, Mr Clarke asked the advisory committee to review medical evidence since it had recommended reclassification in 2001. He referred to a New Zealand study which considered how regular cannabis use increased the risk of developing psychotic symptoms later in life. It also highlighted a report from Maastricht University which concluded that use of the drug \"moderately increases\" the risk of psychotic symptoms in young people, but has \"a much stronger effect in those with evidence of predisposition for psychosis\". Mr Clarke went on: \"I want to be clear what influence the evidence presented within these studies has on the overall assessment of the classification of cannabis. I would also welcome advice on claims of increased prevalence of cannabis with high levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). \"Typically these are grown hydroponically and are known as 'skunk' varieties of cannabis. I am aware the Dutch government are taking a particular interest in very high-strength strains and are considering whether cannabis above a certain strength should be a higher classification.\" The Home Office was asked if the reference to the Dutch proposals indicated Mr Clarke was considering a two-level classification system for cannabis in this country. A spokeswoman said: \"That will be a matter for the review to report on. Depending on what comes up they will discuss that with the Association of Chief Police Officers.\" Sir Michael was abroad and unavailable for comment. A statement from the committee said it continued to take a keen interest in recent studies on cannabis. Martin Barnes, chief executive of the drugs information charity DrugScope, said: \"When the ACMD recommended reclassification it fully considered the available evidence that cannabis can trigger mental health problems. \"It is right that the classification of cannabis, as with all drugs, is closely monitored on an ongoing basis, but we must ensure that such monitoring takes place on a rigorously scientific basis and is not motivated by political factors.\" The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"We welcome the government's recognition that they got this wrong. \"The downgrading of cannabis was a dreadful decision which sends out mixed messages about the dangers of drugs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
