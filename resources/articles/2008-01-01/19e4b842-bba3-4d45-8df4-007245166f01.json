It's a charming idea. But, sad to say, writers are as often tormented by the books they didn't write as they are contented with the books they did. The ones that get away always look bigger - and diminish pleasure in those that were landed. On the face of it, George Steiner has little cause to feel this kind of regret. Few scholars have been as active, few literary critics of his generation as influential. His ideas about language, translation and the effects of the Holocaust on the literary imagination are widely known. And as well as numerous books of criticism - The Death of Tragedy, In Bluebeard's Castle, Antigones and After Babel among them - he has also written an acclaimed novella, The Portage to San Crist\u00f3bal of A.H., and other works of fiction. Yet Steiner is haunted by the oeuvre that might have been, the books in his head which never made it to the page. \"A book unwritten is more than a void,\" he says, it's \"an active shadow, both ironic and sorrowful\", the book \"which might have made the difference\". Unusually, Steiner puts a precise figure on his unwritten books: there are, or were, seven, and he tries to appease his sense of loss by devoting a chapter to each of them. More unusually still, he analyses what it was that made them ultimately unwritable. Most unusual of all, he strips off the mask of academic impersonality to reveal the intimate details - both physical and psychological - that held him back. There's little sense, at first, of how confessional he's going to be. \"Not many today, I presume, read the works of Francesco Stabili, better known as Cecco d'Ascoli,\" his second chapter begins, and a lecture unfolds touching on such matters as astrological determinism, Tuscan literary hegemony, and \"the uneasiness of the linguistic-psychological position of Bologna and the Marches\". It's dauntingly arcane until the real theme of the chapter comes into focus: D'Ascoli's alleged jealousy of his rival and near-contemporary Dante, or, more to the point - for it's here that the writing catches fire - the history of intellectual envy in general, with telling examples from Steiner's own life. \"Twice I have heard the phone-call from Stockholm ring in the office next door,\" he tells us, \"and been invited to join in that evening's celebrations.\" It's not that he thinks the Nobel committee should have been phoning him instead. As a teacher and critic, he accepts that he's an attendant lord, not \"the real thing\". But \"when a poet, whom I had opposed and bested in public debate, having just returned from Stockholm, looked at me and said a single mocking word: 'Sorry',\" it was hard for Steiner to take. So he understands why men have \"betrayed, committed perjury, plagiarised, even murdered\" out of envy. And he writes with particular insight about the difficult relationship between teachers and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, or masters and disciples, the drive to supersede being \"inherent in pupillage\". (\"In my fifty years of teaching,\" he says, \"I have had four pupils, three men and a woman, abler, more original, more open to crisis and modernity, than I am\", and the outcome has been unhappy in every case.) Candid envy of others' greater talent is better than lying to oneself, he concludes. But a book about D'Ascoli would have been too near the bone. In its stead is a terrific chapter on Steiner's unlovely preoccupation with the \"taxonomy of merit\", an account that's more exposing than perhaps he realises. The next chapter is riskier still. \"What is the sexual life of a deaf-mute?\" it begins. \"To what incitements and cadence does he or she masturbate?\" These aren't questions to which most of us will have given much thought, but Steiner has always been interested in the relationship between the libido and language, and here he comes up with a startling thesis: \"I believe that an individual man or woman fluent in several tongues seduces, possesses, remembers differently according to his or her use of the relevant language. That the love and lechery of the polyglot differs from that of the monoglot, faithful to one language.\" As someone fluent in English, French, German and Italian, Steiner knows what he's talking about and, Casanova-like, recalls his sexual relationships in four different tongues, protecting his lovers with initials or abbreviations. There's S (German), who when undressing would mouth and hum a children's rhyme \"in which castration . . . was clearly audible\". Or V, whose \"grammar of love-making was Viennese\". Or A-M (Italian), who \"took pride in the thicket of her 'burning bush'\", and whose requirements for lingual stimulation send Steiner into Proustian or Updikean raptures. Or the distinguished academic (English) \"sitting next to me in a tedious colloquium [who] scribbles on her notepad: 'wouldn't it be more fun if we fucked?'\". Not to mention his \"first [French-speaking] teacher in the arts of orgasm, praise God an older woman burnished by irony and compassion, [who] bade me 'Come, come now and deep'. But did so using the formal vous.\" As will be apparent, some of this is embarrassing and risible, not least when he describes \"Ch\": \"When nearing climax, she would cry out, though in a muted register, the name Sankt Nepomuk the Lesser.\" Only a lover of Steiner, you feel, would ever do that. But there are moments of intended humour, too, as when he talks about his \"prolonged liaison\" with the hypochondriac N (French): \"At moments, I had the impression, so vivid in Moli\u00e8re, of inhabiting, of copulating in, a pharmacy.\" In the end, Steiner's exploration of \"semantic Don Juanism\" establishes very little, except that he has been around a bit, but it's a fascinating test of the limits of indiscretion. Elsewhere he sticks to marginally safer ground. One chapter describes his relationship to Judaism, and his disappointment that Israel has \"diminished that moral singularity, that aristocracy of non-violence towards others, which were the tragic glory of the Jew\". (To Steiner, the true condition of the Jew in the diaspora is as \"a guest among men\".) Other chapters disclose his aversion to party politics and institutionalised religion (in both he is governed by \"privacy and intellectual obsession\"); his view of education in France, America and the UK (with a stern defence of elitism against the \"penitential submission to the rights of populism\"); and his fascination with the sinologist and microbiologist Joseph Needham, whose leviathan study Science and Civilisation in China is, Steiner argues, more akin to Proust's \u00c0 la Recherche . . . than it is a work of history. In each case, a lack of guts, energy, inwardness or conviction stopped Steiner writing the relevant book - though those qualities are much in evidence in the condensed versions he gives here. There's courage, too, in the remaining chapter, on animals and animal rights, since Steiner knows that when he lovingly lists the St Bernards he has owned (or warns, in relation to his current dog, Ben, that \"if anyone offered him hurt, my rage, my impulse to interpose could turn homicidal\"), many of his peers will find him sentimental and self-indulgent. Perhaps an emotional defect or childhood trauma is to blame for his love of pets, he ventures. Or could it be \"what is least Jewish in me?\" Whichever, he is unapologetic in his belief that so long as there's cruelty to animals \"there will be no end to our politics of hatred and internecine ruin\". In his critical writings, Steiner used to be imperious, whirling out ideas and allusions so rapidly that few readers could keep up. But his 1997 autobiography, Errata, owned up to some surprising frailties, not least his anger at the unacknowledged appropriation of his writings. Ten years on he comes across as more vulnerable still, overcome by late-flowering doubt and a crippling awareness of \"the abyss at the heart of love\". If he isn't exactly humble (his confessions of failure sometimes sound more like boasts), he remains his own man, and this spikily honest little book exposes more of the man than ever before. \u00b7 Blake Morrison's And When Did You Last See Your Father? is published by Granta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
