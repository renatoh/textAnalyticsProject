Once freed, he will need close, continued medical supervision but he has a murderous hatred of mental health staff and has repeatedly threatened to kill the doctors who are treating him. Several are now so concerned for their safety that they refuse to see him. This man is not unwell enough to be confined to a psychiatric hospital and he has served his full prison term. He is just one of hundreds of violent and dangerous prisoners who will be freed this month into the hands of the probation services. Staff in room 104 of a central Bristol police station have gathered to assess how they can keep the city safe from him on his release. He is the first on the list of 10 cases that this MAPPA (multi-agency public protection arrangements) meeting must confront this morning. Because of the sensitivity of the cases under discussion, journalists and the public are not usually allowed to attend these meetings. All of the cases are equally complex and potentially catastrophic, concerning individuals whose prison sentence is about to expire, but who are still considered to pose a serious risk to the public. Staff have to work out how best to manage the highly unpredictable behaviour of newly released prisoners. \"Periods of transition are hard for him so the transition from prison, the great supportive womb, will be very difficult,\" a doctor who has been treating him in prison says, smiling cheerfully at the two police officers and two probation officers who are with him around the table. On a previous release from prison, Sean successfully tracked down the home address of one of the nurses who had been caring for him and tossed a brick through her window; no one believes his threats to kill can be discounted. The challenge is to develop a way to release him so he can continue to be treated by doctors, without exposing any of them to serious harm. \"The pattern is that when the psychiatric doctors get too involved, that's the point that he becomes resentful and feelings of hatred well up within him, and that's when the threats to kill come up,\" the doctor says. \"The advice is that mental health workers should keep their contact fairly superficial, provide a service which he needs, but try to prevent these feelings of hatred from welling up by minimising any intensity of contact.\" A new drug has been prescribed that has left Sean \"looking very sedated, not quite zombified, but very slow in conversation\". The doctor thinks that this is successfully managing the hallucinations but much depends on whether he continues to take his drugs when he is no longer being supervised by prison officers. \"I am getting very alarmed comments from my colleagues. Some have suggested that we just discharge him but that is not a responsible option. He deserves medical treatment; he needs it. I have agreed to take him on,\" the doctor says. \"We will need a TAU marker,\" Detective Chief Inspector David McCallum, who is co-chairing the meeting, concludes. The doctor, who is not as fluent in the lexicon of acronyms that slip from the tongues of the probation officers and the police service, asks what this means. \"TAU \u2013 apologies. Treat as Urgent,\" McCallum says. \"We'll need to protect his ex-doctors. It has not been unknown for consultants to be murdered on their doorsteps.\" The addresses of four doctors who have treated him in the past will be added to the TAU list, speeding up the response to any 999 call from these homes. \"I am making an assumption that he will take his medicine. If he doesn't and his mental health deteriorates, then he must be sectioned immediately,\" says the doctor. A detailed safety plan designed to thwart potential opportunities to reoffend is drawn up for each still-threatening prisoner whose prison term is about to end. The atmosphere within the MAPPA meeting is calm; the fate of some of Bristol's most dangerous offenders is in the hands of this group of half-a-dozen people \u2013 probation officers, police, social workers and doctors \u2013 huddled around a table, eating chocolate digestives from a tin. Next up is Peter K, 40, a sex offender who has served four years in prison for five indecent assaults on his daughter, but who is still hopeful that he may be able to win back the right to have contact with his family. This is out of the question, and his probation officer is concerned that once Peter realises there is no chance, a \"catastrophic event\" could occur. The case troubles everyone concerned. \"We all agree that Peter has the ability to cause serious harm to his family. He says he has purely benevolent feelings towards his children and says he will continue to pursue through the courts the right to see them and have contact with them,\" his probation officer says. Since Peter was jailed for abusing his daughter, his wife has had a mental breakdown and been hospitalised, but not before she told her children: \"Your dad's going to come and find you and slash your throats.\" The children have been put into care. \"They know that he is due for release and they are very frightened. The fear is all-consuming,\" the probation officer says. The detective co-chairing the meeting asks the officer: \"Does he fall into the category of someone who has nothing to lose? Is he likely to think: 'If I can't have my family then no one can?' And would he go on to wipe out the whole family?\" She agrees that this is a plausible scenario and expresses alarm about what might happen once he realises he will never see his children again. \"We think there is a risk of a SFO [serious further offence] if he is disappointed and angry,\" she says. As part of the terms of his release Peter will be prevented from travelling to the county where his children live and any breach will see him sent straight back to prison, and probation officers have to go largely on trust. They are naturally concerned about how trustworthy he is, and decide to add a stipulation that he must be made to sign in every hour at the supervised hostel where he will be staying \u2013 thereby denying him enough time to drive to where his children live. However, these signing duties will only last for a certain time, and once the period of supervision by the probation services runs out, he will be left again on trust. \"If he fails to comply, we need to secure the children immediately. It wouldn't take him too long to drive there. He may be thinking he has got nothing to lose, that he is going to find his family and kill himself and them,\" the probation officer warns. Various practical measures are agreed on. Police stations will all be given an up-to-date image of him. A panic button will be installed in his wife's home. They decide that since the father knows his daughter's mobile number she should be given a new sim card. The school will be briefed and asked to keep the children inside until they are picked up by an approved carer. The room is getting stuffy, but the meeting remains calm and good-humoured. The MAPPA administrator, wearing glittering black six-inch stilettos, offers everyone more biscuits as the cases continue to unfold, each as disturbing as the next. The discussions stretch on beyond lunch without pause. The co-chair describes it as a \"fairly average morning\". 'She's been annoying me on purpose' Probation officer Tom W has a supervision meeting with Harinder S, a 24-year-old father of four small children who has been beating his wife with the vacuum cleaner. The weekly meeting is a key element of the community sentence handed down for domestic violence offences, and Tom has to broach the subject of violence and abuse and assess whether Harinder still poses a risk to his wife and children. The session is not going well. \"I think she has been annoying me on purpose and then I lose control and then I hit her,\" Harinder says, recalling earlier attacks and admitting that he still feels angry when his food is not cooked on time, when the housework is not done and when the children, aged between two and five, are allowed to watch too much television. He is no longer allowed to live in the same house as his wife and children but sees them at the weekend. \"Do you take her views into account?\" Tom asks. \"What kind of views?\" \"Well, she might explain why she does these things. She has four young children to look after; perhaps things just get on top of her\" \"No. She has never expressed any views,\" Harinder replies, looking down. The meeting is conducted in a small room, strangely decorated in an apparent attempt at institutionalised cheerfulness with orange walls, purple doors and lime green tables. \"Do you think you might frighten her?\" \"Maybe,\" he concedes. Tom hands him a photocopied sheet with a circle with the word \"violence\" on one side (listing intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse in pie-chart segments) and \"non-violence\" on the other (trust, negotiation, respect and fairness) and asks him to make notes on which side he relates more to and to return the following week to discuss it. There will be another 14 months of these mandatory weekly visits, which take the place of a custodial sentence. Two women a week get killed by domestic violence, so Tom's assessment of Harinder's capacity to reoffend is critical. Tom, a probation officer with four years' experience, believes in people's capacity to change. He is responsible for 55 criminals and has about 20 meetings a week with offenders to assess whether they are drifting back into criminal behaviour. Some of these obligatory meetings form part of a community sentence, some form the second part of custodial sentence, conducted once the offender has been released. Five on his list are convicted murderers, three are rapists, five have been convicted of child abuse; about 20 are categorised as high-risk; all are men, mostly between 18 and 30 (\"It tails off a bit after that; they develop things in their life that are meaningful: jobs, relationships, children,\" Tom says). The risks posed by each offender on his list are calculated by a computer system, Oasys, which processes a number of questions (total number of offences for which convicted, number of court appearances under the age of 18, age at which first in contact with the police, number of previous custodial sentences, and many more) grinds the responses through an algorithm and ranks each person according to their likelihood of reoffending and the danger they pose to the public. About a third are in prison and two-thirds are out. \"It can be a bit challenging at times to feel that you are on top of all of them,\" he says. The prospect of any of them reoffending while on his watch hangs heavily on his mind. Inevitably his judgments would come under high-level scrutiny, although, as he points out, there is a limit to what he can do. \"People don't understand that you are not responsible for offenders 24/7. They aren't in prison any more. It's about risk management.\" Earlier this year Dano Sonnex was convicted of murdering two French students in London shortly after being released from prison to the supervision of the London Probation Service, prompting renewed criticism of the service. The idea of trying to supervise 127 offenders, which was the caseload of the probation officer responsible for supervising Sonnex when he murdered the students, would be \"completely unmanageable\", Tom says. The first stated aim of the probation service is to keep the public safe and to prevent the creation of more victims of crime, but beyond this is a more subtle aim \u2013 to turn offenders into good members of society, to convert them, reform them, rebuild them as law-abiding individuals. There is a very optimistic streak running through the service; everyone here believes in the concept of turning over a new leaf. 'People take our work for granted' The work of these frontline probation officers is rarely glamorised by television drama (there is no equivalent of The Bill for the probation service) and yet \u2013 according to Sally Lewis, chief officer of the Avon and Somerset probation area \u2013 their work is a fundamental part of making the country safe. It is about reducing crime in an invisible way. \"Every day our officers will take decisions that stop women being attacked, children being abused,\" she says. \"The work is unseen. We don't have sirens flashing, people kicking down doors. And a woman going to the shops safely, that isn't news. People take it for granted.\" The probation service is responsible for dispensing punishment in the form of \"community payback\" (with offenders dressed in orange bibs stating that they are doing community service), but at the same time they have a number of tools at their service to help individuals get on the right track: helping them get into good accommodation; helping sort out their finances; rebuilding ties with families; helping where possible to find work or training; sorting out mental health problems; putting them into group self-awareness courses designed to tackle their offending behaviour. The weekly supervision meetings are a friendly assessment of what progress has been made, allowing the probation officer to categorise the offender's risk level. \"I help people make positive changes, get people to the point where they lead productive, law-abiding lives,\" Tom says. But he's realistic: \"You want to think that you can change people quickly but for that to happen you have to transform their lifestyles and that doesn't happen overnight. It can take 15 years.\" Probation officials tend to be sceptical about the benefits of prison for lesser crimes and argue that community sentencing is a much better way of getting reoffending rates down. (Statistics show that 60% of people who are sent to prison for less than 12 months reoffend within two years of release, but only 36% of those given a community order go on to commit another crime.) But they are also aware that the public see this as a soft option. This is another reason why probation is so poorly understand by the public, according to Harry Fletcher, a trade union leader for the service, who argues that \"no government is going to invest in publicising the work of something that is perceived as being softer than prison.\" The government has announced \u00a320m cuts to the service's \u00a3894m budget this year and a further \u00a350m next year, and these ongoing cuts to funding will make it harder to ensure that offenders are adequately supervised. Steve Collett, joint vice-chair of the Probation Chiefs Association, says that he is \"concerned that those offenders who represent a risk to the public in terms of regular acquisitive crime and less serious violence will not be supervised as closely as they need.\" Later Tom meets Rajiv S, out of prison after serving a year's sentence for attacking his ex-girlfriend's front door with an axe, and damaging her car. He had been drinking and smoking a lot of cannabis at the time. The meeting is conducted in friendly way, but there is a rather Victorian undertone, with Tom quietly chastising his client for his vices. \"So how are you then?\" Tom asks. \"How are things at home?\" Part of Rajiv's supervision order rests on him being well behaved. If Tom thought he was not, he could, theoretically, send him back to prison. \"How is your alcohol use?\" \"Normal.\" \"What is normal?\" \"My normal amount.\" \"What is that?\" \"A couple of pints on Saturday night,\" Rajiv says. Tom encourages him to think about the consequences of drinking too much. Rajiv, dressed in an acid-yellow T-shirt and black bomber jacket, is very polite and deferential and seems well versed in the correct Enhanced Thinking Skills language. \"I am thinking about the consequences long term. What happened before, it ruined my life. It ruined my family's life. It is a ripple effect. I don't want to drink too much. I see the damage it causes,\" he says. Tom concludes the meeting: \"I very much think that it is about keeping that alcohol under very tight control. I would say anything more than an occasional drink would be a worry.\" \"Yes. Very much.\" Rajiv has to report back in a week's time. Can Tom believe that he is no longer drinking? \"We are reliant on self-reporting to an extent,\" he says, but he believes that Rajiv is truly remorseful and repentant. Things would be better if Tom could help him to find a job, but there is little prospect of that. \"Getting work for anyone at the moment is difficult and there is an added barrier for someone who has a history of offending,\" he says. Most of the people on his list have a serious problem with drugs or alcohol, but the roots of their problems are deeper. \"Social exclusion. Problems in their childhood. Poor parenting. Poor educational attainment. Lack of access to employment. Lack of positive adult role models,\" he says. \"You do feel sympathy for a lot of these people.\" Although they are allied as law enforcement agencies, the culture of the probation service is very different from that of the police force. Probation officers are much closer to social workers than police officers. A police officer who works a lot with the probation service, says the police are trained to be cynical, while probation officers are taught to see the best in people. \"Our training and background makes us more cynical in our attitudes towards their intention to be rehabilitated,\" the police officer explains. \"Our role has been to catch and convict them, whereas probation is more about rehabilitation and resettlement. You become more sympathetic to them because you begin to understand more about why they have done what they have done, you get an insight into their lives and what has gone wrong. As a uniformed police officer you just see the offender and the offence.\" 'I'd like to live a normal life' Last week Sadie H, 20, was convicted of stealing four sets of knives from Ikea, with a value of \u00a369, which she sold to buy drugs. She is addicted to crack, heroin and alcohol \u2013 a difficult combination because if you tackle the drug abuse, the alcohol problem tends to get worse. She wants to enrol for an intensive drug-rehabilitation course, as part of her sentence. Emma E, a probation officer with five year's experience, has to assess whether she is really motivated, or is just vying for softer treatment. Around 7,000 people in Bristol are registered as addicted to class-A substances. The majority of them cannot hold down a job and are on income support, but when you are getting around \u00a355 a week in benefits payments the only way to maintain a \u00a320-a-day drug habit is through crime. It makes sense to tackle the drug addiction in order to reduce crime; the probation service has a separate team to target drug-addicted offenders. They go into a bare side-room next to Bristol's dedicated drugs court, for a 40-minute interview. Emma works through a set of questions trying to judge whether Sadie is enjoying her lifestyle or is really ready to give up. Sadie is very pretty and smiley, with long black hair, white teeth, dirty trainers, and a black hoodie. She is wearing jeans, and later says she can't wear skirts any more because the deep vein thrombosis she has developed from years of injections has ruined her legs, making them bloated and fat. \"It isn't very nice, being 20 and having big fat legs. It's horrible.\" She has to inject a drug into her stomach every day to treat the DVT. She started taking drugs when she was very young, because both her parents were addicts and introduced her to heroin. \"There was a lot of bad company around the house.\" Her father died of an overdose when she was 15 and that's when she began to inject herself daily. She says she was abused as a child, which is why she is taking drugs, but also it gives her something to do. \"It is something to fill up my days, bide my time.\" When she came out of prison on bail last week there was a giro cheque for \u00a3380, and she and her boyfriend spent all the money that day on drugs. Later she went begging for money for food. The following day she drank three litres of cider. Sadie wants to live a normal life. She tells Emma that her GCSE predictions were very good, but she never actually sat them. \"I'd like to go back to do my exams and get a nice flat and live a normal life.\" She has a sad face, is very polite and has folded her hands on her knee in a schoolgirlish show of obedience. She has nine convictions, for battery, assault, ABH and shoplifting. \"What is a normal life?\" Emma asks. \"Having friends who don't take drugs. Going out on Friday nights. Doing things that normal 20-year-olds do.\" \"You are normal,\" Emma says, reassuringly. \"Everyone is a bit different.\" She probes a bit further to see if she can gauge Sadie's commitment to quitting. \"With a drug rehabilitation system you can only get out of it what you put into it. I don't want to set you up to fail it.\" \"I do want to do it,\" Sadie says, her lips wobbling. \"It's not going to change overnight. I can't make you give up drugs. I can't make you stop offending. I can just put you on the right route,\" she says, and tells her to come in for drug testing twice a week. \"I don't want to see you shoplifting again,\" Emma adds. \"I'm going to try really hard,\" Sadie tells her. Through the glass door, across the corridor, a girl in another room is crying, her elbows on the table, her head cupped in her hands. Emma feels positive about Sadie's prospects. \"Obviously it's not an ideal situation when a father is injecting his young daughter with heroin, but it happens quite a lot. She is saying all the right things, she is clearly intelligent, very self-aware. She has a lot going for her. I have good feelings about her,\" she says. \"I am an eternal optimist. You have to believe that people can change, because otherwise, what else will you do with them? But with drug users it can be quite soul-destroying when you see they aren't making any changes, they come out of prison, breach the terms of their licence, reoffend, go back to prison.\" She passes no judgment on those who fail, pointing out that giving up heroin is comparable to giving up smoking. \"You only have to talk to your friends who are trying to give up smoking. Some of them give up and start again; some of them manage straight away,\" she says. Champion car burglar There are between 300 and 400 offenders in Bristol, who, between them, commit 30,000 crimes a year, about 80% of the crime in the city \u2013 mainly burglary, street crime and car theft. David F, a probation officer in the prolifics department, is working with Greg, 34, who is ranked by police as Bristol's number-three car burglar, capable of breaking into 15 cars a night to fuel his heroin addiction. He has 26 convictions for 72 offences, but since he came out of prison 10 weeks ago and came under David's supervision he \"hasn't reoffended, touch wood\". He is on methadone, and has been given a curfew, stopping him from going out between 7pm and 7am (there is a tag which G4 security monitors). David has found him a local-authority flat and has helped him source secondhand furniture from charities, he has referred him to group drug-addiction treatment, obliging him to visit a drugs worker twice a week for an hour to discuss his treatment. Greg will have a meeting with his probation officer once a week, where he will undergo a drugs test; he doesn't have to pass the test but he does have to turn up, and show that he is attempting to control his addiction. \"It's not like trying to fix a broken car. It's much, much more complicated when you are trying to fix a person,\" David says. He tries to calculate his success in terms of the number of crimes he has prevented. \"Each person on my caseload of 30 can do a burglary a night. That's perhaps 10,000 crimes a year I'd be stopping if they all followed the terms of their order,\" he says, impressed as he does the maths. These prolific offenders are not criminal masterminds. There are young boys with learning difficulties so profound that they are unable to get on a bus alone, dumb enough to get caught for stealing cheese from the Salvation Army, they are teenagers who have suffered from ADHD for years, unable to remember anything unless it is written down for them, men who have attended special schools for people with behavioural problems, young boys who have replaced their methadone dependency with crack addiction, boys who admit that they have been institutionalised before the age of 20 because of their repeat exposure to the prison system, men who are homeless. Most of them have no GCSEs and a large number are embarrassed by their inability to read and write. \"It is stressful. It is very sad to see the history that they are dealing with,\" David says. \"The society that we live in is very damaged; I do get cross when I think that in a society which is supposed to be one of the best in the world, people are living in such squalor.\" Names of offenders and probation staff have been changed.
