The club are seeking to prolong the stays of some key personnel, not least because they are one of a number of English sides under investigation by Fifa over possible violations of rules on the signing of foreign players under the age of 18 and could be the subject of lengthy transfer embargoes if found guilty by the world governing body\u2019s disciplinary committee. Marcos Alonso, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta have all agreed new terms recently, and are likely to be followed in the near future by Antonio R\u00fcdiger. Yet David Luiz, like Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gary Cahill, is entering the final six months of his deal with his situation rather more delicate. The Brazil defender, in his second stint at the London club, was outstanding in Saturday\u2019s victory over Manchester City, scoring the hosts\u2019 second goal and showcasing his best qualities throughout as the champions were beaten in the Premier League for the first time this term. The 31-year-old has reaffirmed his commitment to Chelsea and would ideally like to stay, and Maurizio Sarri indicated last week his preference would be to retain him. However, David Luiz would want more than the 12-month extension that is currently on the table, aware as he is that he would be able to secure longer terms elsewhere. Foreign clubs can start negotiating with him from January over a summer move under freedom of contract and, with Chelsea having indicated they are unwilling to shift their long-standing stance on players over 30, there remains a strong possibility that the centre-half will depart in the summer under the Bosman ruling. \u201cI am just trying to enjoy myself, like I do every single day,\u201d said David Luiz when asked about the uncertainty over his future. \u201cThen, for sure, we will do the best thing for me, for Chelsea, for everybody. We are still talking, let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see what the future brings. I love this club, everybody knows I want to stay.\u201d Cahill is expected to leave on loan in January before departing permanently on a free transfer in the summer, while F\u00e0bregas, who is now considered Jorginho\u2019s understudy and has started only one Premier League game this season, is attracting interest from clubs in France and Italy. Sarri will be reluctant to lose any key players in January and revelled in the defensive excellence of his veterans David Luiz and Azpilicueta, on Saturday. City had not lost in the league since early April but, having dominated the opening half, were punctured by Kant\u00e9\u2019s opening goal just before the interval. David Luiz had played his part in that with a glorious cross-field pass from deep to Pedro on the right flank, and would rise to meet Eden Hazard\u2019s corner to confirm the win 12 minutes from time. Asked if Chelsea\u2019s success may have wounded City, whose start to their title defence had been so imperious, David Luiz said: \u201cI hope, I hope, I hope so. But I also know they are a fantastic team and they accept to lose sometimes, too, because they have experience of that. But I hope we hurt them and we can move up the table and be closer to them. At the moment they are the best team in the world [who have played] more than three years together. It is never easy to play against them, but I think we had the right humility and right plan to win the game. When you play this type of game, it is a time to give everything and understand how far you can go. So this was an amazing game and we beat the best team in the world.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s back-line had been made to look rather more vulnerable in their recent loss at Tottenham Hotspur, but both Sarri and David Luiz suggested City\u2019s imposing reputation had helped focus minds to instil a more disciplined defensive display. \u201cThe way they play, they are able to keep the ball, even the goalkeeper is amazing,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to be honest and have the humility to say: \u2018OK, we have to defend, we have to suffer because we play against a fantastic team.\u2019 They create many opportunities if you don\u2019t concentrate.\u201d Sarri had dropped \u00c1lvaro Morata from his match-day squad, preferring to use Hazard as a false No 9 with Olivier Giroud as an alternative on the bench, but offered the Spain forward hope he will be involved in Sunday\u2019s trip to Brighton. Morata was at Stamford Bridge and undertook a warm-down session on the pitch after the final whistle. \u201cI don\u2019t know if in Brighton we will play in the same way or not, maybe not,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cBut \u00c1lvaro is able to understand that it is only a tactical decision, not the final choice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
