As the old year dribbled away, Georgie did her last shift on Sky Sports News, an event whose coverage on the channel was pitched somewhere between This Is Your Life and Churchill's funeral. It all seemed a little de trop to me, as La Thompson is staying with Sky, merely moving over to its Formula One coverage. I may, however, not be the most reliable commentator on her valediction, having previously been largely unaware of Georgie's apparently impressive body of work. I have seen her on Sky's comedy sports show A League Of Their Own, on which she is a cheerful and well turned-out regular panellist, but rarely says anything funny \u2013 something she has in common with the rest of the participants. But her 10 glorious years on Sky Sports News seemed to have passed me by. This may be because I usually encounter Sky Sports News as a silent channel. It is often on in pubs with the sound turned down or inaudible, often causing me to miss my turn at the bar when momentarily distracted by breaking news of an achilles injury at Upton Park. It also plays away silently in gyms as part of the illusion that joining such an establishment, buying shorts and trainers adorned with the name of a sportswear company, and watching dedicated sports TV, is somehow helping solve the obesity crisis. I always assumed the well-groomed man with the neat hair, and the identikit blonde with the even white teeth, were hired to give us something nice to look at when our eyes stray from the league tables and coming attractions on the right and the groin strain captions running along the foot of the screen. I have certainly never felt moved to ask for the sound to be turned up as the familiar parade of managerial talking heads appears: Steve Kean with his Gary Barlow-style staring eyes, Neil Warnock with the flashing smile of a jolly but slightly sinister uncle, and Harry Redknapp jerking his head around as if trying to escape some Dixon of Dock Green-type copper of his East End youth trying to administer the traditional clip round the ear. Back at my gaff, though, the volume was pumped up for Georgie's swansong, which included a surprise guest on the line waiting to wish her all the best for her future with, er, Sky Sports. According to co-presenter Julian Warren, well-wishers had been \"queuing up\" for the privilege of being Georgie's final interviewee, and guess who had been chosen? Why, Harry Redknapp. \"I'm completely stumped. This is amazing. Oh dear, oh me. Thanks for coming on the line,\" gushed Georgie, although why an appearance by the Spurs boss should have stunned her so was a mystery. When I am exercising (or whatever you call watching the telly in the caf\u00e9 at the gym) or waiting for two pints of lager and a packet of crisps, Harry's jerky head seems to be on a continuous loop on Sky Sports News. It is easy to see why Harry is such a regular guest. He is an obliging interviewee who will talk at length, helping fill the unforgiving minutes and hours when there is nothing you might classify as actual news. Someone once defined news as \"anything that makes a reader say 'gee whizz' \" \u2013 which is not an expression I use habitually, but neither that nor any of its stronger equivalents were in any danger of being uttered during the four hours I joined Georgie for her final shift. I know Sky Sports News is not designed to be watched continuously for four hours \u2013 that way madness lies \u2013 but during my stint the only genuine news was a drug ban for the rugby league player Martin Gleeson, and a victory for Novak Djokovic in a tennis match. Oh, and the fact that Georgie was moving to a different programme. They showed an old clip of Georgie dancing on some Christmas tape, and her debut, reading the sports news in 2001, and she did that cringeworthy TV presenter thing of covering her face and pretending to be all embarrassed. \"I've changed. Tell me I have,\" she giggled. She has, but I thought she was actually better back in 2001, fresh out of Leeds University's broadcast journalism course \u2013 a little nervous, I expect, but not so you would notice \u2013 speaking carefully, clearly and precisely. Now she is super confident, and something of a star if Twitter is anything to go by, she races along at breakneck speed, with the \"news\" coming a poor second to a winning smile. So, for those of you who missed it, Luka Modric may or may not be leaving Spurs in the summer, and Emile Heskey has a slight injury. And from now on you will have to get used to a new blonde telling you this stuff. Gee whizz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
