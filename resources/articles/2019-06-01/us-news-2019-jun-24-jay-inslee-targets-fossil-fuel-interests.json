If elected, Inslee says, he will cut billions in fossil fuel subsidies, ban new drilling on public lands and in offshore waters, phase out fracking for natural gas, end the use of coal and ban oil exports. He also proposes to create a climate pollution fee, institute an environmental justice office within the Department of Justice in order to prosecute polluters, and adopt a \u201cclimate test\u201d for new infrastructure projects. \u201cEven as fossil fuel corporations harm our communities and endanger our future, they continue to benefit from billions in US government subsidies and giveaways,\u201d the plan says. \u201cThey are privatizing their rising profits even as they impose massive costs on society.\u201d Experts say Inslee\u2019s climate plan, which also aims for net-zero carbon pollution by 2045, is the most comprehensive of any presidential candidate. But the governor is not among frontrunners in national and state polls. Inslee will announce his new campaign promises from the Florida Everglades on Monday morning, before joining an airboat tour with environment advocates. Earlier this year, a Florida court decided to allow oil exploration in the Everglades, a unique ecosystem that is also a drinking water source for millions. Other contenders for the Democratic nomination, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have echoed portions of Inslee\u2019s proposals, particularly ending subsidies and new extraction on public lands. Advocacy groups including the youth-based Sunrise Movement have called for White House hopefuls to distance themselves from the oil, gas and coal industries. Most Democratic candidates have signed a pledge to refuse campaign donations from certain fossil fuel interests. The notable exception is former vice-president Joe Biden, who has said he will not take fossil fuel money but has yet to formally commit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
