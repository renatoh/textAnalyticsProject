Albanese is also expected to clean up the opposition\u2019s position on the controversial Adani coalmine during the trip, after the project \u2013 which has since been granted approvals by the Queensland Labor government \u2013 continually tripped up Bill Shorten\u2019s campaign in the sunshine state. Albanese will leave for Barcaldine in western Queensland, considered the spiritual birthplace of the Labor party, on Tuesday morning. It will be the first stop in a regional tour intended to win the state back after its historically low polling result in May. Mining towns Emerald, Rockhampton and Gladstone top the list, and Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Maryborough and Gympie will round out the four-day tour. Labor suffered swings against it in all the seats covered by the tour, but Albanese has suggested his personal popularity could help win back voters put off by Shorten, telling radio 2GB: \u201cI have always had a positive reaction in Queensland.\u201d While in Emerald, Albanese will meet mine workers as Labor continues its pivot towards coalmining as a positive for the economy \u2013 a position Albanese made clear on Monday following interventions from Joel Fitzgibbon. \u201cOne of the points that I make as well is that the demand for coal and our coal exports are demand-driven,\u201d he told 2GB. \u201cThat is, that places in the world want to buy our product, whether it\u2019s coal or iron ore or copper or other products. It is not something that is driven by the fact of the export \u2013 it is the other way around. And if we were to stop exporting coal tomorrow, then that would just lead to a displacement with more coal being bought from all the places in the world: South America, Indonesia, a range of countries \u2013 we are not unique in having coal assets. \u201cAnd that would likely lead to an actual increase in global emissions because much of our coal is much better quality than is available from the alternatives. So we need to be sensible about the way we examine this.\u201d The Greens have seized on Labor\u2019s narrative shift, with Melbourne MP Adam Bandt accusing Labor of joining the Morrison government in \u201cabandoning climate action\u201d. \u201cLiberal and Labor value coal more than human life,\u201d he said. \u201cCoal is fuelling the fires, coal is fuelling the drought and coal is fuelling the smoke over Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane. If you don\u2019t have a plan to get out of coal you don\u2019t have a plan to deal with the climate crisis. We stopped selling asbestos and we need to phase out coal exports too.\u201d Meanwhile, the resources minister, LNP senator Matt Canavan, has taken to the media to demand Albanese vocalise his support for the Adani mine. Albanese has previously said it is for the market to decide whether or not the Adani coalmine goes ahead. But with the Queensland election \u2013 now less than a year away \u2013 looming as his first big test as leader, Albanese is expected to take a more definitive line on the topic. With the latest ANU electoral study confirming Labor\u2019s ongoing trend of losing support among working class voters, Albanese\u2019s choice of Queensland regions is no accident as he seeks to win back the party\u2019s base. \u201cI am someone who what you see is what you get \u2026 I say it as I see it,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cAnd I will be pleased to talk to workers from across industries \u2026 and I enjoy talking to people, whether it\u2019s in a pub, in a club or in a worksite. And I very much look forward to not just talking but listening as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
