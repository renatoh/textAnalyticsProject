What if new technologies such as television and electronics become pervasive? George Orwell's answer to the latter, in 1948's 1984, was to show the apparently perfect, controlled society they could enable. But one thing usually missing is the \"how?\" At the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy (CFP) conference, held in Washington, DC, last month, Vernor Vinge, a retired computer scientist and the author of Rainbows End, provided a compelling explanation of how developing technology and powerful interests could create a society far more invasive and controlled than anything Orwell dreamed of. The scenario he describes is the background he researched for Rainbows End. Set in 2025, the characters are surrounded by logical extensions of today's developing technology. Wearable computing is commonplace. Tagging and ubiquitous networked sensors mean you can look at the landscape with your choice of overlay and detail. People send each other silent messages and Google for information within conversations with participants who may be physically present or might be remote projections. One character's projection is hijacked and becomes the front for three people. The owner of another remote intelligence is unknown. Several continents' top intelligence operatives try to solve a smart biological attack that infects a test population with the willingness to obey orders. Assumptions Vinge makes two opening assumptions: no grand physical disaster occurs, and today's computing and communications trends continue. He added a third trend: \"The great conspiracy against human freedom.\" As novelist Doris Lessing has observed, barons on opposite sides of the river don't need to be in cahoots if their interests coincide. In our case, defence, homeland security, financial crime enforcement, police, tax collectors and intellectual property rights holders offer reasons to want to control the hardware we use. Then there are geeks, who can be tempted to forget the consequences if the technology is cool enough. Vinge quotes the most famous line from the comic strip Pogo: \"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\" Vinge's technology to satisfy these groups' dreams is the Secure Hardware Environment (She), which dedicates some bandwidth and a small portion of every semiconductor for regulatory use. Deployment is progressive, as standards are implemented. Built into new chips, She will spread inevitably through its predecessors' obsolescence. This part is terribly plausible. It sounds much like the Trusted Computing Platform, implemented in Intel chips and built into machines from Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens and others. Most people don't realise their new computer contains a chip designed to block the operation of any software not certified by the group. Now enhance that and build it into RFID chips, networked embedded systems, shrink and distribute as \"smart dust\". All are current trends or works in progress. Geeks are willing to fight Trusted Computing on the grounds that it could be used to block open-source software or to enforce draconian digital rights management. But what if accepting it meant less visible security, less bureaucracy, even slight profit? She automatically sends taxes, enables much less noticeable surveillance and gets you through security checkpoints with no waiting. There's less crime, because legislative reality can be enforced on physical reality. Fewer false convictions. Make regulation automatic, and it seems to go away. New laws can be downloaded as a regulatory upgrade. \"She,\" Vinge concluded at the conference, \"fits the trajectory that economics and technical progress are following. The infrastructure for such control will probably arrive in any case.\" He also calls his scenario optimistic. This is, however, one of the paths to Technological Singularity, which Vinge wrote up in a 1993 essay. It's the moment superhuman intelligence is achieved, either through systems we build or human augmentation. The Singularity changes everything; nothing after it is predictable. In the world of Rainbows End, he thinks, they are either on the verge of Singularity or it is happening. This caused its own singularity in science fiction. Charlie Stross, whose novel Accelerando attempts to depict living through the Singularity, has called it \"the turd in the punchbowl of near-future SF - you may politely pretend it isn't there, but everyone has to deal with it.\" Author Ken MacLeod places the Singularity in the context of post-2001 hopelessness. \"When human beings feel they can't change the future, they begin to imagine that maybe superhuman beings can: gods, angels, aliens - and now artificial intelligences (AI). The idea of the Singularity is just a sophisticated version of this ancient ... superstition, that human history is or soon will be made by something other and better than human beings.\" Way to believe Vinge doesn't dispute the notion that humans look for a way to believe things will be better. Year 2000 software remediation is an example: \"Prudent apprehension caused an awful lot of money to be spent ... and was one reason there were no significant problems.\" Most people assume the cause of the Singularity, if it happens, will be the effect of Moore's Law (that the number of transistors that can fit in a given space on a semiconductor doubles every 18 months). It's also usually connected to AI. In his essay, however, Vinge suggested four or five paths to the Singularity, only one of which was unitary AI. But here is where Vinge's thinking gets optimistic (unlike the CFP conference, which saw surveillant databases everywhere). The road to technological Gaia is full of frictional costs that could stop it. \"It's not going to work very well,\" he says, \"but it will be attempted, both by the state and by civil special interest petitioners.\" The drug laws provide a perfect illustration: \"The ideal job to have in government is something everybody is convinced is essential to be done successfully that cannot be done successfully and the government is the only entity that can do it. Every time you fail, you say, 'The problem is much larger than we imagined, give us some more money.'\" \"The leaders of most powerful countries are coming to realise that the most important natural resources are not factories or the size of armies. Economic power is in the size of the population that is well-educated, creative and generally happy enough to be optimistic enough to want to do something creative.\" \"The illusion of freedom becomes a strange thing when a government is dealing with ... thousands of people who are as bright as the smartest people running the government. Together, they outclass the people running the show. The turning point is the notion that to provide this illusion of freedom for such a group would wind up being more like real freedom than anything in human history.\" Or, as he thinks Pogo might say for the 21st century, \"We have met what's going to save our ass and it is us.\" \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
