The 28-year-old, who joined West Ham for \u00a36m from Newcastle only 12 days ago, was taken to hospital for x-rays although the club's worst fears were expected to be confirmed. For Alan Curbishley, West Ham's manager, it was a familiar sight. Dyer had been signed primarily as a replacement for Julien Faubert, the Frenchman who ruptured his achilles tendon only 16 days after arriving at Upton Park for \u00a36.1m from Bordeaux. Dyer had been bedevilled by injuries during his time on Tyneside but his latest absence could well be the most serious. With Dean Ashton still yet to start since breaking his ankle on England duty 12 months ago, West Ham could be forgiven for believing they are cursed. This was never going to be a routine night for West Ham from the moment Dyer collapsed near the touchline. He fell to the ground clutching his right leg, with the pain obvious as he held up a hand to signal that the injury was serious. Hayden Mullins complained bitterly that Joe Jacobson's challenge was dangerous but, although West Ham were awarded a free-kick, the Bristol Rovers left-winger appeared to make a genuine attempt to win the ball. That was no consolation to Dyer or West Ham. Indeed it was five minutes before the midfielder, surrounded by his team-mates and West Ham's medical staff, left the field on a stretcher clutching his head in his hands. His departure could have been the cue for the visitors to believe fate had again conspired against them but instead a merited lead was gleaned in the 31st minute. Mullins picked Stuart Campbell's pocket before Bellamy drove a low 30-yard shot past Steve Phillips. Bellamy should have added a second within minutes but his free header lacked conviction. The Welshman would not be so profligate later in the half when, having raced on to Lucas Neill's pass, he capitalised on Phillips' decision to stay on his line, steering a low 12-yard shot beyond the Rovers goalkeeper. It was a cruel blow for the League One side, although their only meaningful chance in the first half was a tame Richard Walker header that Richard Wright easily saved. The home side offered a greater threat after the interval, with Jacobson, their most penetrative player, seeing his cross-cum-shot repelled spectacularly by Wright before Andy Williams lofted the ball over West Ham's goalkeeper with 19 minutes left. Renewed hope among home fans was not enough to bring parity, however."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
