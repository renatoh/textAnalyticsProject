But in the glow of a sunny evening, Owlpen Manor was a soothing prospect. It was an idyllic scene - a wooded valley with a babbling stream, a Tudor manor house and church surrounded by a sprinkling of cottages in mellow honey-coloured stone. It could be a set designer's dream of the perfect Cotswold hamlet, and in a sense, it is; the manor was rescued by arts-and-crafts architect Norman Jewson in 1916, and the remainder of the buildings have been restored or added by the current owners, the Mander family, over the past 30 years. Our home for the weekend was the Court House, a converted 17th-century banqueting house - a favourite of the late Robin Cook, apparently, who came here to write his speeches. Though not quite child-friendly enough for anxious metropolitan parents (spiral staircases and toddlers do not happily coexist), the house oozed history and Alexander was fascinated by the hooting of owls outside. The rooms were tiny but cosy, and the low-ceilinged attic bedrooms would appeal to older children. There are nine cottages, sleeping from two to 10. The finest are in historic listed buildings. A couple are modern and rather characterless, but probably more practical for families with very young children. There is a restaurant, The Cyder House, located in a 15th-century barn, with ancient cruck trusses and a gigantic oak cider press in one corner. It is only open for lunch and teas in the summer, plus one evening a week, but prepared dishes can be ordered in advance. With our son safely asleep (a cot and highchair were provided), we sat down to enjoy steak-and-ale pie made with organic Owlpen beef. Later, we stepped out to the churchyard a few yards from our door to watch an enormous full moon rise silently above the yews. The valley is notably free of light and noise pollution. The following morning, we explored the estate. There are miles of walks through beech woods, perfect picnic spots in abundance, and a wonderful sense of seclusion which makes the 21st century seem very remote, though Alexander was more interested in the resident cows, sheep and ducks. By Monday morning, the Arcadian setting had worked its magic on us. If your ideal weekend is a peaceful one spent deep in the English countryside, Owlpen would probably suit you.
