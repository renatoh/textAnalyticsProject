The England World Cup hopeful, who scored in the north London derby on Saturday, is contracted to Spurs until 2008, a deal which he agreed only last summer. However, after a string of impressive displays for club and country, including as a holding midfielder for England in the World Cup qualifier against Poland, the 24-year-old is hoping for a new offer. His advisers are in negotiations over improved terms, reported to be in the region of \u00a350,000 a week, which would bring King in line with Spurs' other top earners such as Edgar Davids. \"It's between my agent and the club. I am just letting them get on with it and concentrating on my football. I've always said that, if we are going in the right direction, I haven't got a problem.\" King added: \"The lads have given us an indication of what we are capable of. We have a young squad and we have to keep going. The Champions League would be a bonus. You take it one game at a time and see where we can get.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
