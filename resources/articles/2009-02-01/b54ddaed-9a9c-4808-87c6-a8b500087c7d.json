This uses CommentPress, a WordPress theme, according to my source, which is Ellen Miller's blog post. Now everyone can read the text and comment on whatever paragraphs catch their attention, which is much nicer than writing to digitalbritain@berr.gsi.gov.uk These have certainly been some hostile responses in the press. For example, \"Trinity Mirror chief executive Sly Bailey has accused the government of a 'crushing lack of understanding' over the urgent need to reform the merger laws governing the local media,\" according to Press Gazette. Media Guardian collected a wide range of industry responses, which showed that there was plenty of scope for both praise and blame. So far, however, WriteToReply.org has only had 10 comments, spread over six sections and dozens of paragraphs. I hope this is because not enough people know about it, rather than because not enough people care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
