The move came with Mr Abbas under growing international pressure to begin clamping down on the militants responsible for such attacks. Israeli leaders decided not to mount an immediate military strike in response to the suicide bombing in order to give Mr Abbas time to begin dismantling terror groups. Last night's blast, which happened on a bus crowded with Jewish families returning from the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine, killed 20 people and wounded more than 100, including around 40 children. The scale of the attack led to expectations of a swift and deadly Israeli response, but Israeli security sources cited by the Associated Press said that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, had decided to give the Palestinians more time to begin cracking down on the militants. Mr Abbas has said he will not confront the militants because he fears internal fighting. However, he is now under growing pressure from Israel and the US, the main backers of the road map peace plan, to take firm action. The European Commission, which described the attack as \"an attack on all the forces working for peace\" urged the Palestinian Authority \"to do everything in its powers to prevent such unacceptable and unjustified\" acts of violence. Israel is expected to intensify its hunt for wanted militants if the Palestinian security forces do not take action. However, a major military strike, on a par with last year's offensives in response to bombings of a similar scale, is not being considered, according to an Israeli defence official. Security officials also decided against targeting the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, the official said. In the past, troops have repeatedly besieged Mr Arafat's West Bank headquarters. The Palestinian Authority's next move could well determine the fate of the road map, which observers believe still has a chance of success despite the bus blast. It was the deadliest Palestinian attack since the peace plan was unveiled by the US president, George Bush, three months ago. Mr Abbas was meeting with Islamic Jihad leaders in Gaza City on Tuesday evening when he received word of the bombing. Condemning the attack as a \"terrible crime\", he broke off contact with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. He also called off trips to Italy and Norway, planned for later this week. In the Gaza Strip, Hamas leaders today insisted they remain committed to a three-month truce that they and other militants declared unilaterally on June 29, but said they reserve the right to take revenge for the killing of their members by Israeli troops. Israel froze all contacts with the Palestinian Authority and cancelled the planned handover of two West Bank towns to Palestinian control, a move that had been expected later this week. The Israeli army also closed border crossings to seal off the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinian MP Saeb Erekat criticised the decision, saying that it was important to maintain contacts. \"The main message I want to send to the Americans is that ... every possible effort should be exerted to keep the road map and the truce alive,\" he said. Also today, it emerged that the bomber, who had disguised himself as an ultra-Orthodox Jew, may have had a personal motive for the attack. The assailant, 29-year-old preacher Raed Mesk, from the West Bank city of Hebron, was friends with an Islamic Jihad leader in Hebron, Mohammed Sidr, who was killed by Israeli troops last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
