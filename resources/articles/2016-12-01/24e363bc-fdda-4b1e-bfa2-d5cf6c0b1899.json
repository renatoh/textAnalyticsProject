Should be a hard-fought final, so join me next Saturday at 6.40pm for a glitter-tastic night in. Thank you all for joining in, feel free to swing by Twitter @heidistephens and say hello, otherwise I\u2019ll see you next Saturday! Claudia and AJ dance their final dance to Sybil\u2019s The Love I Lost, which is an absolute 90s banger. Because it\u2019s the Semi and they\u2019ve got to pad out 40 minutes, Claudia gets a montage! I\u2019m really sad that Claudia and AJ aren\u2019t in the Final next week \u2013 Claudia\u2019s confidence has grown so much, and their Showdance would have been something to behold. Also she\u2019s a West Country girl like me, and you\u2019ve got to support the locals. Claudia and AJ say lovely things about each other, and it\u2019s getting a bit dusty in here. So what will the judges do? Craig saves Danny and Oti, even though both dances deserved tens. Darcey does likewise, and Bruno follows the trend. Len says \u201cI\u2019d have picked Claudia, but she\u2019s not doing the Strictly tour so I can\u2019t risk her winning\u201d. OK, he doesn\u2019t really. Time for a revival of Claudia and AJ\u2019s Quickstep, which was my favourite dance of last night. It\u2019s still entirely fabulous, and if the judges were deciding on this dance alone, I think I\u2019d pick this. But of course that isn\u2019t how Strictly works, is it? Right, dance-off time! Danny and Oti are up first, and he\u2019s still loitering on that pier. It\u2019s a lovely American Smooth, albeit a bit bouncy and not very smooth for my liking. That said, the leap at the end is still incredible. It\u2019s CLAUDIA AND AJ the dance-off, which means LOUISE AND KEVIN are safely through. That\u2019s a brace of weeping Cliftons in the final, and Claudia and AJ gone, barring Danny dropping Oti on her head. Bum. Turns out Len\u2019s Lens is actually quite interesting. Damn, what a time to find out. Hooray, a Len\u2019s Lens montage! It\u2019s time for the very last Len\u2019s Lens, so as a mark of respect I\u2019m going to pay attention for pretty much the first time ever. It\u2019s time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Sting, because musical relevance on Strictly is a ship that sailed several decades ago. This week last year we had Kylie Minogue singing about her winter fuel allowance. In summary: it\u2019s quite dreary. Oh no wait, it\u2019s a climate change anthem, I just heard something about penguins and ice disappearing. Dreary, yet worthy. Oti is shocked to be in the dance-off. Welcome to the public vote. Not that it will do Danny any harm for next week\u2019s final, as now his fans will remember to vote for him. Right, let\u2019s get down to business. The first couple in next week\u2019s Grand Final is\u2026.ORE AND JOANNE. Ore is in bits, I\u2019m really pleased for him. And the first couple in this week\u2019s dance-off is\u2026DANNY AND OTI! Ooh, didn\u2019t see that coming. Bye bye whoever is up against him. Last night on Strictly \u2013 a really very decent semi, with some great dancing from all four couples. Highs: a couple of brilliant Quicksteps, a weird but kind of wonderful Argentine from Ore and Joanne, Oti\u2019s blue dress, Claudia Winkleman face down on a crashmat. Lows: Louise\u2019s costume hell, the Dave Clark Tango, Bruno evidently jacked up on sugar and dishing out tens like Skittles. Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a red affair that does nothing for her magnificent cleavage, Claudia in black sequins. Both a bit Next Boxing Day Sale. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s pro dance has a bird theme, featuring Janette contempo-wafting in a cage to Sia\u2019s \u2018Chandelier\u2019. Someone throw her some Trill. Ooh, more birds. This is quite\u2026 feathery. Has the Strictly Selfie been around all season, or is it a new thing? Seems a bit late to be just launching it, I must have missed it. It\u2019s a better idea than \u201cdoing the Strictly\u201d last year. Look, Darren Bett is lovely, but he\u2019s no Schaf, is he? Although a purple shirt paired with moss green cords suggests Darren has a dressed-in-the-dark approach to fashion, which I approve of. It\u2019s the final Countryfile Casual Weatherman of the Strictly season, so obviously I\u2019m holding out for Schafernaker in a naval officer\u2019s uniform. What? Come on, it\u2019s Christmas, and I\u2019ve staring at this laptop for three months. Throw me a bone. Evening all, and welcome back to the very last Sunday night Results Show of the Strictly season! We\u2019re at the sharp end of this week\u2019s Semi, with only three places available in next week\u2019s Grand Final. Who will it be? I think Danny is a guaranteed finalist, as I can\u2019t imagine the judges choosing any other dancer over him in a dance-off, even though Ore was ahead of him on last night\u2019s leaderboard. The other two places could be claimed by any of the remaining three and I couldn\u2019t call a dance-off between any of them, so all very exciting. Join me at 7.20pm to find out! So that\u2019s IT for the semi-final dancing! I\u2019ll be back here from 7.20pm tomorrow to find out which three couples will make it through to next week\u2019s final. Thank you as always for joining in; I\u2019m dashing off now to party like it\u2019s 1991, so enjoy the rest of your Saturday night, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow! Cheers, Hx So Ore and Joanne at the top of the leaderboard, and Louise and Kevin and Claudia and AJ are together at the bottom. I think that\u2019s how the bottom two will pan out \u2013 and that dance-off really could go either way. HOW EXCITING. Scores: 9, 10, 10 (DRINK), 10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Ore and Joanne. There is crying from Ore (DRINK). Darcey thought it was fast and furious, and the tension was incredible. Len reminds us that Ore has no dance experience, and Ore danced with incredible precision, it was a terrific and wonderful performance. Bruno thought it was mesmerising, with incredible lines. Craig noted that Ore lost balance, but he should be incredibly proud. Well this is quite something, with incredible intensity from Ore and quite a mesmeric quality. The music actually works in a weird kind of way, although that spinny lift felt a bit laboured and his posture goes a bit hunchy at the end. Loved that, but not sure it\u2019s enough to get him into the final. And FINALLY for this week, it\u2019s Ore and Joanne! Their second dance is the Argentine Tango to \u2018Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\u2019 by Kylie Minogue. This is such a random choice for an Argentine, it\u2019s either going to be incredible or a total car crash from start to finish. Let\u2019s hope for the former, it\u2019s been a good night so far. Scores: 9, 9, 10 (DRINK), 10 \u2013 who rattled Darcey\u2019s cage this evening? She\u2019s given 10s to loads of old guff in previous weeks. Craig loved it \u2013 she kept the pace right to the end and Claudia looked like she was dancing for her life. Darcey loved how they used the dancefloor, although there were tiny elements of gapping. Len thought it took them from gymnastic to fantastic, and they overcame the height difference brilliantly. Bruno thought Claudia was like a ray of sunshine, and the footwork didn\u2019t miss a beat. Well this is marvellous. Loads of fun and bounce, and Claudia\u2019s smiling like she\u2019s never smiled before. Fabulous footwork, incredible pace, great posture from Claudia and right now she looks like a proper contender. I\u2019m smiling. Are you smiling? It\u2019s time for Claudia and AJ! Their second dance is the Quickstep to \u2018When You\u2019re Smiling\u2019 by Andy Williams. If Claudia\u2019s footwork can keep up with AJ\u2019s pace, this could be an amazing Quickstep. I really want these two in the final, can you imagine how incredible their Showdance is going to be? Claudia has anticipated us including \u201cdouble dancing\u201d in this week\u2019s Bingo, but I didn\u2019t. SORRY. Scores: 10,9,10 (DRINK), 10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Danny and Oti. Bruno was swept away by the emotion and the exquisite storytelling. It was right up Craig\u2019s street too, but Darcey thought one of the lifts looked clumsy. It was right up Len\u2019s alley too, and his natural turns were beautiful. Danny\u2019s mooching about on a pier until Oti drops her hankie and it all gets quite romantic. This has lovely pace and swing and some great lifts, and there\u2019s no denying that Danny is a fabulous dancer. But yet still he leaves me cold, I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019ll probably win, and on dance talent alone he probably should. But I need JOURNEY. Next up it\u2019s Danny and Oti! Their second dance is the American Smooth to \u2018Misty Blue\u2019 by Dorothy Moore. To be fair Danny could come out and shuffle his feet randomly for three minutes and still make the final, but let\u2019s go through the motions anyway. Scores: 9, 9, 9, 9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Louise and Kevin. Len thought it was full of rhythm and attitude, and it was a great Samba, Bruno thought it was tutti frutti Samba, and it had plenty of content. Craig wanted more bounce and accentuation in the upper body, but it was a vivacious performance. Darcey loved the joy in Louise\u2019s face and the tautness in Louise\u2019s upper body, and she loved how Louise was flirting with Kevin. Gag. Imagine what Carmen Miranda would look like if she ever played tennis, and that\u2019s Louise\u2019s outfit. Kevin, meanwhile, is dressed as a warehouse operative in Ikea. Louise is giving it full ruffly hips, and it\u2019s all rather fun and charming. From the neck up, Louise looks like she\u2019s having a ball, but her Samba needs a bit more drunken-auntie-at-a-wedding welly. I would leave this party after an hour. Right, round two. First up it\u2019s Louise and Kevin! Their second dance tonight is the Samba to \u2018Brazil\u2019 by Thiago Thom\u00e9. If ever there was a time for Louise to down two sambucas and unleash her inner Samba goddess, this would be it. We\u2019re half way through tonight\u2019s show! Stay with me, lovely people. Scores: 8, 10, 10 (DRINK), 10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Ore and Joanne. Darcey loved how Ore kept his calm and composure, and it had incredible energy and attack. Len thought it was a triumph \u2013 it had speed and control, and he give it a standing ovation. Bruno loved how Ore shook it to the foundations, and it was a fantastic dance. Another standing ovation. Craig thought Jo set a very high standard, but Ore\u2019s posture suffered slightly. Len argues that Craig is making it up, and it\u2019s all kicking off. Ore is on a motorbike, and Joanne has gone full Ursula The Sea Witch. It\u2019s a super-fast Quickstep with some great footwork and timing from Ore, and only a couple of tiny balance wobbles. Really nice, enjoyed that very much. And finally for this round, it\u2019s Ore and Joanne! Their first dance this week is the Quickstep to \u2018Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\u2019 by Jet, which is an absolute banger. I feel like Ore\u2019s lost the confidence he had for the American Smooth and Jive back in Weeks 3 and 4, it would be lovely to see it come back enough to get him in to the Grand Final. I would gladly sacrifice Louise and Kevin for this outcome (sorry Louise). In the VT, Ore is crying. DRINK. Scores: 8, 9, 9, 9 \u2013 a total of 35 for Claudia and AJ. Craig thought it was a bit square and lacked flow and chemistry, but he loved the pointy toes. Darcey loved Claudia\u2019s extension but it needed more intent and connection which they don\u2019t have because they\u2019re YOUNG. Len thought Claudia was dressed as his favourite Quality Street, but there was a lot of cocking her leg up. He wanted more hip action, however. Bruno thought it had beautiful lines but Claudia\u2019s hip action needed to continue through her body, but she didn\u2019t because she\u2019s YOUNG. Should have put Claudia being young in this week\u2019s bingo. So the thrust of this Rumba narrative is bare-chested manchild tries to seduce purple Quality Street, it all gets quite angsty. Claudia does the splits (DRINK), and points her toes a lot. There\u2019s not a lot of actual Rumba hip action and her foot placement goes a bit awry, but good toe-pointing. It\u2019s time for Claudia and AJ! Their first dance is the Rumba to \u2018Bleeding Love\u2019 by Leona Lewis. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone delivering a filthy Rumba to such an insipid song, least of all two extras from High School Musical, but let\u2019s see what surprises Claudia and AJ have up their sleeves. Danny\u2019s had a really busy week. DRINK. Scores: 9,9,9,10 \u2013 a total of 37 for Danny and Oti. What\u2019s the point of Bruno these days? He\u2019s basically Donny Osmond now. Bruno loved the flamboyance and flair, and Oti is a very naughty girl (creepy). Craig thought it lacked figure-8 hip rotation, but the lifts were AMAZING. Darcey loved the intricate detail in the lifts, but she wanted a bit more wildness and attitude (YES). Bruno falls off his chair, but sadly appears uninjured. Len thought it was like his porridge \u2013 tasty, satisfying with a bit of Oti flavour (heaves) Oti\u2019s outfit is va-va-voom as usual, not sure about Danny\u2019s high-waisted slacks. This is a proper Salsa with bags of content and some great footwork from Danny, but his Latin feels a bit heavy sometimes. There\u2019s no doubt he can dance, would have liked a bit more pace and party spirit. Bit..sober? Next up it\u2019s Danny and Oti! Their first dance is the Salsa to \u2018Vivir Mi\u2019 Vida\u2019 by Marc Anthony, who used to be married to J-Lo, fact fans. I can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t seen Danny\u2019s Salsa shimmy yet, am very much hoping this is going to be a treat for my eyes. Tess looks GAWJUS this week, I\u2019m not sure what to do with this new information. Scores: 9,9,9,10 - a total of 37 for Louise and Kevin. And so it begins. Len loved the conveyor belt thing, and it had lots of attack and attitude, despite a small moment. Bruno loved that it was a happy tango with wonderful content, and he was thrilled and delighted. Craig wanted to see more v-shape in the frame, and Louise lost her balance, but it was full of content and he loves watching Louise dance. Darcey thought the attitude and attack was stunning. Just me, then. So Louise and Kevin are working in a glitterball factory, and then they start Tango-ing in a flagrant disregard for Health and Safety. It\u2019s a nice effort from Louise, but entirely lacking passion and attack, possibly due to the terrible music choice. Not my cup of tea, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s \u201cmessages from the public\u201d week in the VTs. Where do they find these people? They\u2019ve never been to my house. First up it\u2019s Louise and Kevin! Their first dance this week is the Tango to \u2018Glad All Over\u2019 by the Dave Clark Five. Would it be too much to ask this series for a Tango to be danced to some actual Tango music? Crap Tango music makes me the opposite of Glad All Over. Out come the celebs! Claudia has drawn the short straw for the Big Purple Quality Street dress, whilst Louise has gone for some kind of turtleneck penguin costume. Awful. Tess and Claudia Dress Watch: Tess in a rather nice black and white pantsuit with both shoulders present and correct, Claudia in another unfetching lace number. 6/10. And we\u2019re off! Cue a VT of atmospheric pleas to save celebrities from certain obscurity. They all want it bad. Danny has spent every waking hour in the training room this week \u2013 DRINK. I love the BBC Oneness trailer. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Bit of housekeeping for later \u2013 I\u2019ll be dashing off with indecent haste at the end of tonight\u2019s liveblog to go to a Christmas party, so apologies in advance for not hanging about for comment box chat. I\u2019ll have a proper read of all your comments in the morning, when it will be perfect cure for my inevitable hangover. This week\u2019s Stricty Come Bingo \u2013 a swing of something you were saving for Christmas for any occurrence of the following: Ore crying Any member of Louise\u2019s family Danny talking about how hard he\u2019s worked Claudia doing the splits A ten from Len Evening sparkle mafia, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! We\u2019ve made it to the semi-finals for another year, which means one of the few glimmers of telly joy in a bleak 2016 is coming to an end next weekend. Boo. But don\u2019t start crying glitter just yet, we\u2019ve got a massive semi to tackle first. Tonight\u2019s show is shaping up to be an edge-of-your-seat affair, with each couple taking on the TWO DANCES. At least I think it\u2019s two, nobody\u2019s really mentioned it. History tells us that, much as we hope for a double helping of showstopping performances, this week is likely to be an unholy mess of under-rehearsed dancing and frantic over-scoring from a judging panel who have mentally left the building. What\u2019s going to make it interesting is that any one of Claudia and AJ, Ore and Joanne and Louise and Kevin could leave the Strictly dancefloor this weekend, so there really is everything to dance for. I\u2019ll be here from 6.50pm to kick things off up here, and would be most pleased if you could add plenty of wit and sparkle in the comment box below. It\u2019s the final push, so let\u2019s make it count. See you then!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
