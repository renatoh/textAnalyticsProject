The five-year-old has been limited to just one European outing this season after suffering from knee problems, finishing second to Wellbeing in a Group Three race at Deauville last month. Sakhee, who is to be retired to stud at the end of the season, has been pleasing the Godolphin team in recent gallops. \"He worked on Thursday with a lead horse and he's doing very well,\" said his trainer Saeed bin Surror at Newbury yesterday. \"The last two days he has been a different horse. We have to give him time.\" Sakhee could still bid to repeat last year's impressive victory in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, but bin Suroor hinted on a trip to Newmarket for the Emirates Airlines Champion Stakes, saying: \"He's still in at Longchamp, but I think I would like to run him in the Champion Stakes,\" added bin Suroor. Godolphin won their own money yesterday when Meshaheer landed the Dubai Duty Free Cup. Ridden with confidence by Frankie Dettori, the 5-1 chance led inside final furlong and held Gateman's late run by a neck."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
