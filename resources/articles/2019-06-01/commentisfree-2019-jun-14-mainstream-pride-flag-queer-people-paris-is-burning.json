If I had the opportunity, I would be one. And that is like a fulfilment.\u201d These words were spoken by the New York drag queen Dorian Corey, as documented in Jennie Livingston\u2019s landmark Paris Is Burning (1990). The documentary \u2013 this week re-released in New York cinemas and now available on Netflix \u2013 charts the subcultural \u201cballroom\u201d scene of mid-to-late 1980s Harlem, where LGBTQ+ black and Latinx people competed in runway battles and Voguing dance-offs. The thriving community is also the subject of Ryan Murphy\u2019s acclaimed FX-series Pose, currently available on BBC iPlayer. Corey\u2019s quote relates to an aspect of ballroom history I\u2019ve long been fascinated with: that of \u201crealness\u201d. As part of their pageantry, ballgoers would compete at imitating the most conventional images of white America; categories ranged from \u201ccorporate executive\u201d and \u201cmilitary general\u201d to \u201chigh-fashion winter sportswear\u201d and \u201cgoing to college realness\u201d. In this counter-cultural space designed exclusively for LGBTQ+ people of colour \u2013 most from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds \u2013 was an intent to wear the costumes of the country that denounced them. Debate still rages today about the way mainstream institutions appropriate LGBTQ+ culture \u2013 you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a brand that doesn\u2019t flash a rainbow logo this Pride month \u2013 but what happens when LGBTQ+ communities instead steal from the mainstream? And what does this tell us about the relationships LGBTQ+ people have with the dominant culture? For decades, queer artists have manipulated the language and imagery of heteronormative society. Drag\u2019s rich history of lip-syncing is a vivid example. Many LGBTQ+ people can recall that first spine-tingling moment in a nightclub when they became hypnotised by a drag queen mouthing the words to their favourite song \u2013 and in doing so giving it a whole new meaning. For me it was a queen in New York, who transformed Whitney Houston\u2019s club banger I Wanna Dance With Somebody into a gut-punching cry for intimacy after lifelong familial rejection. There\u2019s something immediately galvanising in seeing a queer person steal a product from dominant culture, only to empty it out and replace its original connotations with ones that resonate with their community. In a way, drag performers are to pop culture what Robin Hood is to the financial elite. And even if a performance isn\u2019t explicitly political, the mere act of watching a queen/king lip-sync to a song originally designed for the masses can inspire hope. As LGBTQ+ people, systemic prejudices mean we implicitly feel unwelcome inside mainstream culture; there\u2019s a sense of triumph in watching ourselves assume the culture that discounted us, and on our own terms. This cold war between mainstream and counter-culture was at the heart of Andy Warhol\u2019s work: he had to adopt survival strategies as a gay artist in the US of the 1950s and 60s. His ambition was to create spaces within an institutionally homophobic mainstream in which queer people could feel represented. Take the infamous Marilyn screen prints, where Warhol borrows the newspaper photograph of a female celebrity designed for straight male pleasure, only to colourfully distort it so she\u2019s less a screen siren and more a drag icon. Warhol recycles a widely popular image, smuggling something back into mass culture with which LGBTQ+ people across the US might have a greater affinity. But when does this strategy shift from political subversion to assimilation? For this is the inevitable tragedy running through Paris Is Burning. Although \u201crealness\u201d is by nature irreverent with heteronormative norms, it\u2019s also undeniable that many who practise it are desperate for mainstream America\u2019s stamp of approval. Within the balls, the more \u201crealistically\u201d gender-nonconforming bodies of colour can pass as corporate executives, the more trophies they win (literally). It\u2019s a bit like that bittersweet thrill many gay people confess to when someone says, \u201cOh, I thought you were straight!\u201d The sad paradox is that LGBTQ+ people have suffered so much exclusion \u2013 whether by family, faith, or society \u2013 that we\u2019re often willing to accept any form of validation from the very institution that excluded us. By the end of the documentary, this tension plays out when a black trans woman admits that despite finding refuge in ballroom culture, all she really wants is \u201cto live a normal, happy life. Whether it\u2019s being married and adopting children. Whether it\u2019s being famous and rich \u2026 I want so much more.\u201d As a queer person who has suffered a great deal of familial rejection, I know how seductive any kind of inclusion can feel. When you\u2019ve not had much, even crumbs of acceptance feel like a lot. It\u2019s partly why our community is so susceptible to being co-opted and commodified. So a message to all institutions pouncing on us this Pride \u2013 just because we\u2019re vulnerable, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing. To the Home Office: stop flying our flag while you deport LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. To the NSPCC: don\u2019t boast our colours while you give in to transphobia. To Topshop: don\u2019t parade our filter while you remove trans people from changing rooms. If you\u2019re all going to steal our rainbow, we deserve more than your crumbs. \u2022 Amrou Al-Kadhi is a British-Iraqi writer, drag performer and filmmaker.
