England could have won playing Gangnam Style, which is not how major Test matches are supposed to be. Any firm conclusions about the progress of Stuart Lancaster's evolving team will have to wait until they have confronted the pride of the southern hemisphere over the next three weekends. Whether that description currently extends to Australia's battered forwards is something of a moot point, given their 33-6 thrashing in Paris on Saturday. As well as elevating France into the top four of the world rankings, a vital statistic ahead of next month's Rugby World Cup pool draw, it leaves England strangely unsure what to expect. Lancaster, wary of a Ned Kelly-style hold-up, will remind his players this morning that underestimating Australia is a game exclusively for mugs. The England coach is conscious the influential David Pocock and Digby Ioane should be available and his counterpart, Robbie Deans, can be expected to brandish the horsewhip on the training ground this week. \"They will look at us and be very motivated coming here,\" said Lancaster. \"All three Sanzar teams will be highly motivated to play against us, so we have to make sure we are ready. They drew 18-all against the All Blacks recently. We have to make sure we train at a higher intensity this week and keep our players under pressure so we are ready for what comes next Saturday.\" Danny Care will be available, a citing for a \"tip tackle\" on Fiji's lock Leone Nakarawa being highly unlikely. That word intensity will be pivotal to England's fortunes this autumn. They are a smarter, clearer-thinking side nowadays, with Alex Goode making a significant difference to their midfield depth with his shrewd incursions from full-back. Goode effectively created three of England's first four tries by virtue of his spatial awareness and consistent ability to exploit it but, aside from the set-piece excellence which will concern Australia, there is not quite enough explosive power up front to terrify the world's best. This did not matter hugely against an undercooked Fiji but there are occasions when the back five of this English pack look, from the stands, a shade too nice and lack obvious brimstone. With Courtney Lawes unavailable for at least another week, there is a case for starting Wasps' Joe Launchbury alongside Geoff Parling in the second row against Australia in an effort to dish out a bit more thunder to the boys from down under. The 6ft 6in, 18-stone Launchbury is in excellent club form and is also mobile enough to assist his back row, none of whom play the wrecking-ball role. Longer term the management see him and Lawes as the perfect second-row blend, which is bad news for Saracens' Mouritz Botha. Hurtling back into the reckoning will also come the Saracens' wing Chris Ashton, who was suspended last week and had to watch other English wings diving over the try-line. Like Geoff Boycott \u2013 \"They're my roons he's scoring\" \u2013 a frustrated Ashton will be desperate to make up for lost time, although Charlie Sharples's two tries have slightly complicated Lancaster's selection options on the wings. The eager Sharples left the kind of positive impression which coaches like to reward but both he and Ashton normally operate on the right wing. Lancaster indicated he might be prepared to switch one of them \u2013 Ashton played the first two rounds of last year's Six Nations on the left before switching \u2013 which could edge out Ugo Monye, the latter's disappointment cushioned by his second try in 14 Tests for England. Sharples is relaxed about swapping flanks but is assuming nothing. \"I don't know what's going to happen,\" he said, pointing out one good game should not necessarily propel him up the pecking order. \"If I played 10 good games for Gloucester and someone came in and had a good game I would be disappointed if they took the shirt off me.\" Another possibility would be to start Manu Tuilagi on the left, the side down which the Leicester man scored two strong last-quarter tries. That would necessitate a midfield reshuffle which depends on Jonathan Joseph having fully recovered from an ankle problem. Joseph should at least feature in the matchday squad, although demotion from the bench would be tough on the perpetually committed Mike Brown. Resting on laurels, either way, is not an option. Fiji's sprinkling of naval officers, policemen and wandering pros did score a couple of creditable second-half tries but mostly looked a team who had barely trained together, which was indeed the case. Despite the International Board's best efforts to level the playing field, there is still a yawning gap between the haves and have-nots outside World Cup periods, particularly when the Tier Two nations play away from home. All we can say with certainty based on Saturday's evidence is that Glen Jackson has a distinguished refereeing career ahead of him and that, commercially, Twickenham is booming. There is now even a fast lane at the bar to encourage customers of a certain mobile phone provider to buy their beers quicker. If England keep winning, the Rugby Football Union really will have a bumper month.
