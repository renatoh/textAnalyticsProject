The manager also said he would consider letting Serge Aurier leave, although he would rather keep him. Mourinho was keen to sign a centre-forward in January as he does not believe Son Heung-min has the qualities to play there \u2013 meaning Kane is his only recognised senior No 9 \u2013 and he was upset when he could not get one. Mourinho is now even more eager to sign a player to partner or support Kane as he addresses a start to the season that he described as \u201cnot human\u201d. Spurs could play nine times in 22 days because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup and Europa League qualifying rounds. Mourinho wondered whether \u201cthey want us to play with the youth team in the Carabao Cup\u201d. Spurs have struggled to sign strikers as potential arrivals fear they will not get sufficient minutes because of Kane. But Mourinho has said that if a centre-forward is scared of the England captain then he does not want him. As in January, he is looking for a target man. \u201cIf the striker is afraid to come to Tottenham and he is afraid of competition then I don\u2019t want him,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cAll the other top clubs have many options as centre-forwards and this question doesn\u2019t appear. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s only us where we don\u2019t have the right to have a more balanced squad with more options. Players decide who plays, not me. The striker that comes here has to come with his own ambitions.\u201d Rose, who was on loan at Newcastle from January to July and has entered the final year on his contract, is of interest to Genoa, who finished fourth-bottom of Serie A last season. He did not kick a ball in pre-season and is at the bottom of the left-back pecking order. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for him to stay here when for me it\u2019s clear that Ben Davies is such a solid left-back and Ryan Sessegnon is an investment by the club,\u201d said Mourinho, who also gave minutes to the 18-year-old Dennis Cirkin in pre-season. \u201cThe club knows I\u2019m more than happy with the players I have in the left-back position and that I would be happy for Danny to leave. If he goes to Serie A and Genoa it\u2019ll be very good for him.\u201d Mourinho said he had not signed the right-back Matt Doherty so that he would be able to sell Aurier. But he added: \u201cThe players have the right to express themselves and to try to be happy and if Serge comes to us and a situation that he would prefer we would speak with him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
