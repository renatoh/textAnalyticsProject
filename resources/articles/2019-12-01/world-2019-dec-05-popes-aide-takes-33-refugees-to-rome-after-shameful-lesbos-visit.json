Speaking on his return from a visit to the camps, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Vatican\u2019s almoner, condemned the EU\u2019s handling of the refugee situation, saying that \u201canimals live better in Europe\u201d. The 33 refugees, among them families from Cameroon, Afghanistan and Togo, arrived in Rome on Wednesday night and will be hosted by the Vatican and the Sant\u2019Egidio charity. \u201cWe have the money, let\u2019s begin with ourselves \u2026 let\u2019s open our rectories, convents and monasteries to at least one family each from the Lesbos refugee camps so that we can empty them all,\u201d Krajewski said after landing at Fiumicino airport, in Rome, with the group from Lesbos. \u201cI have seen terrible situations in the camps.\u201d The population in the island\u2019s camps has increased from 7,000 in May to more than 15,000, of whom 800 are unaccompanied children, Krajewski said. \u201cThere is no hope for them stuck in Greece, where they are living in dramatic conditions. This is a problem for Europe and is shameful.\u201d The Vatican\u2019s latest \u201chuman corridor\u201d mission from Lesbos was implemented following the approval of Greek authorities and the Italian interior ministry. Pope Francis, who has likened migrant facilities on Lesbos to \u201cconcentration camps\u201d, brought back 12 Syrian families after visiting the island in 2016. They were temporarily housed by the Vatican before being helped to integrate into society by Sant\u2019Egidio. Ten more people will be transferred to Italy from Lesbos by the end of the year. Greece has been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe over the conditions in refugee camps across its islands. On Thursday a fire broke out in a container housing a family of five Afghans in the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos, killing a 27-year-old woman. Other camp residents managed to safely evacuate the children \u2013 an infant, a three-year-old and a five-year-old. The children\u2019s mother was found dead after the fire was extinguished. Their father suffered smoke inhalation. A fire broke out at the crowded Moria camp in Lesbos in September killing a woman from Afghanistan and triggering clashes between refugees and police. The facility has been hit by several fires since the EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 to stem the flow of migrants, with a woman and child dying in a blaze that year. In November Greece\u2019s centre-right government, which came to power in July, announced plans to close the three largest migrant camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners compared to detention centres. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. It has also passed a law tightening asylum requirements and pledged to increase border controls. Krajewski was named almoner, a job that Pope Francis transformed into a hands-on charitable mission, in 2013. He has worked discreetly, for the most part, for the poor for years. However, in May this year he made headlines after climbing down a manhole and breaking a seal to restore electricity to a building in Rome where 250 homeless people were living. The move prompted an angry reaction from the far-right politician Matteo Salvini, then the deputy prime minister."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
