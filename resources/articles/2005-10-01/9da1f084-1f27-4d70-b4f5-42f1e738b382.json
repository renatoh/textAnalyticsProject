The 47-year-old was brought up on a soulless council housing estate in Ayrshire. 'All of that homogenisation made it quite dispiriting,' she recalls in her comfortable central London office. Today, Ford holds the environment of hundreds of communities in her hands. A 'changemaker' straight out of the New Labour mould, the former Price Waterhouse consultant is the government's 'field marshal' overseeing the rapid acceleration of housebuilding in the south east. This includes the Thames Gateway, an expansion of Milton Keynes and the building of 10,000 new homes on the Greenwich peninsula. She is also helping to revive former coalfield communities and foster the economic renewal of northern towns in a post-industrial world. Her job is to assemble large tracts of land, decontaminate them where necessary, get planning consents, ensure infrastructure is funded and then release plots to private developers. 'I actually love the buzz you get from property and infrastructure and I can't understand why more women aren't attracted to it, because it's a fantastic industry,' she says. So is she concreting over the countryside? 'It's a powerful image but I think it's misplaced,' she counters in her soft Ayrshire twang. 'I can honestly say that across our portfolio we're only building on brownfield land, on land previously developed or on sites such as Milton Keynes that have been zoned for development for many years. There's not a single part of the country where we're building on greenbelt land.' Ford points out 'there are not many families in this country who are not touched by the issue of affordable housing'. To enable a growing army of people to get on to the property ladder, Ford believes that local authorities must stop blocking housing schemes. In some areas, developers wait up to five years to win approval, she says. In Greenwich, south London, the biggest post-war housing planning application sailed through the system in nine months. Ford is looking to Gordon Brown, who next month will unveil plans to force councils to release more land and approve more schemes. A critic of Nimbyism, Ford has ordered her staff to go into local authorities across the country to get them to release an extra 15,000 homes for development. Enjoying a good working relationship with John Prescott, Ford has won over Whitehall sceptics who wanted to abolish English Partnerships and hand its responsibilities to local authorities. The pressure was most intense when she assumed control four years ago. 'The organisation was in the doldrums. It had a hell of a lot of good people but it didn't have the political leadership,' she says. But even private housebuilders who would like to see the government quango enjoy less power concede that Ford has given English Partnerships confidence and focus. It now has first refusal on all government surplus land brought to market so it can ensure the maximum number of affordable homes are built. And Ford has quadrupled English Partnerships' investment programme. It now stands at close to \u00a31 billion, though that underestimates its value: the agency levers in private sector investment far in excess of that figure. Perhaps her biggest triumph will be announced tomorrow. Ford has persuaded the Treasury to let her charge developers a roof tax to fund infrastructure for new homes. It is a big shift away from Treasury control and could see a step change in the number of new homes built. Ford is also at the heart of imaginative plans to ease the financial burden for potential homebuyers by 'sharing equity'. This would see English Partnerships retain a share of home of up to 50 per cent. But building societies appear reluctant to back shared equity, and some say there are not enough homes in the scheme - 100,000 over five years - to make a difference to the housing crisis. As if coping with south-east growth is not enough, there are concerns, sparked by rows over the demolition of terraced houses in Lancashire, that proposals for economic renewal under the government's Northern Way plan are spiralling out of control. Speculators have forced up the price of homes that have to be bought by the taxpayer to redevelop areas of housing market failure. The perception is of growth for the south and the wrecking ball for the north. Ford sees it another way. 'There's a whole economic drive around the Northern Way. It's a lot more than housing.' She adds that three regional development agencies pooling their infrastructure priorities to spark growth 'is a very mature way to behave'. 'I think there's fantastic, totemic, things happening. The merger of the Manchester universities last year is a lesson to us all about actually not being precious about organisations or \"patches\" and setting aside small-scale ambition in pursuit of the bigger game. If you're talking about the commercialisation of intellectual property - this is where the businesses of the future will come from - then you need critical mass to do that to market this to the world.' English Partnerships is most associated with the Millennium Dome. It decontaminated the Greenwich peninsula, spending \u00a3250m in the process, to prepare the ground for the visitor attraction. Subsequently, it was English Partnerships' job to sell the Dome and the 300 acres that surrounded it. The government says \u00a3550m will be returned to the Treasury in 20 years once the area has been developed and sold off. But the Public Accounts Committee chairman, Edward Leigh, said recently: 'Only the incurably optimistic will be confident that value for money has been secured.' Ford is unflinchingly loyal to the government responsible for one of the most embarrassing financial catastrophes of recent times. 'I take the simple view that you have to separate the Millennium Experience and its dealings from the construction of the Dome and the regeneration of the peninsula. My organisation was asked by government to revive the peninsula and secure a long-term future for the Dome. We've done that.' Ford, a mother of three, works three days a week at English Partnerships. Among her other roles, she is a non-executive director at Serco, the private sector company involved in building schools, hospitals and prisons. One construction industry executive has described Ford as 'a New Labour apparatchik' and it does seem that she encapsulates the public-private ethic in human form. Any doubts about big business's role in public sector provision are kicked into touch. 'I've always been a supporter of the mixed economy. At Serco, we talk about a public service ethos and we firmly believe you don't need to be paid by the taxpayer to deliver a fantastic caring service - its about the quality of service, not about who delivers it. It's perfectly legitimate for business to act as agents of government in delivering public service and I think it's insulting to people in the private sector [to say] they cannot bring the same values and ethos as the public sector does.' Whether or not it's the Ayrshire environment Ford grew up in 40 years ago that shaped her view on public sector provision, her ideas certainly chime with New Labour orthodoxy on this one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
