The prospect of a long delay to the China trade deal (if it ever comes), and the threat of France retaliating to new US tariffs on its cheese and champagne both weighed on Wall Street. Traders, says Kyle Rodda of IG, have taken \u201ca cold, hard dose of reality\u201d today. He writes: Volatility has returned in a big way to financial markets. Stocks are down and safe-havens are finding a bid, after US President Donald Trump suggested there\u2019s \u201cno deadline for a trade-deal\u201d, and implied the trade-war could be prolonged into next year. Equity markets are returning to fundamentals now. Once again, fear has the upper hand over greed in the markets. After several weeks of what\u2019s been appropriately described as a sense of complacency, volatility has returned to global markets to begin December. Having been highly suppressed, as traders became giddy on the prospect of a US/China trade-deal, the VIX (the \u201cfear index\u201d) has spiked in the last 48 hours, climbing from a historically low 11 reading, to its current reading at 16. That\u2019s all for tonight! GW Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, thinks Trump\u2019s threat to delay a China trade deal is a calculated move, to bounce Beijing into concessions. He says: \u201cThis is sort of a last-minute negotiation tactic. \u201cIf the December 15 tariffs go into effect, then I think people start thinking that this could have additional ramifications on a \u2018phase-one\u2019 ever getting done.\u201d Almost every stock on the Dow Jones industrial average is in the red in late trading. Basic materials, financial stocks and consumer-focused firms are dong worst, with tech companies and industrials close behind. Intel has lost 3%, with Apple down 2.3%, reflecting concerns that America could impose tariffs on Chinese-made tech products soon. That could kick in on the 15th, unless there\u2019s some movement with China. The Dow is attempting to recover from its earlier losses, but is still down 313 points today at 27,469. Still more than two hours of trading left, so there\u2019s time for a rebound - or deeper losses! Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that a China trade deal could be delayed by a year could just be a ploy. Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, explains (via CNBC): \u201cWe have seen this movie many times before ... where the president throws out remarks during trade talks that in retrospect have just been a negotiating tactic, especially when he starts off by saying China wants a deal more than he does. London\u2019s losses today are partly due to a stronger pound, which is trading over $1.30 again tonight. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The FTSE\u2019s day was made that bit worse by the pound\u2019s own gains. The latest Kantar poll put the Tories 12 points ahead of Labour, contrary to many other surveys showing a shrinking Conservative lead. Ouch! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed at its lowest level since mid-October. Renewed trade war anxiety sent the index down to 7,158, a loss of 127 points. That\u2019s a 1.75% slide, to a six-week low. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies also had a rotten day, ending 199 points down at 20,500. That\u2019s a 1% drop. Today\u2019s burst of trade war drama has been a wake-up call for investors who had hoped that the dispute was being ended peacefully. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It\u2019s been another choppy day for markets in Europe after an initially positive start. Once again it\u2019s been an intervention by President Trump that\u2019s upset the applecart, when in an impromptu question and answer session with journalists he held open the prospect that there would be no US, China trade deal, until after the US elections next year. This insouciance about the prospect of putting off any deal has completely upended market expectations that we were potentially millimetres away from a deal, and also flies in the face of the optimism that has seen markets rally strongly over the last few weeks. It also raises the very real prospect that the tariffs that are due to kick in on December 15th will now not get waived, and will actually get implemented. With the US President also mulling swinging tariffs on French luxury goods, equity markets are starting to look increasingly vulnerable to further declines, especially if the 15th December tariffs do happen after all. For quite some time now investors have been assuming, somewhat naively perhaps that the new 15th December tariffs might well get waived, or delayed. That line of thinking is now seriously coming into question. Unsurprisingly markets haven\u2019t reacted well to this new wrinkle, and if investors were caught off guard by yesterday\u2019s belligerence, then this new revelation is unlikely to assuage them that the US is anywhere near to closing any sort of deal with China, or anyone else for that matter. CNBC\u2019s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera is losing faith that China and the US will ever reach a trade deal.... All these negative headlines on trade have knocked China\u2019s currency to its lowest level since October, as Bloomberg\u2019s Katherine Griefeld points out here: Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, has just dampened hopes of a trade breakthrough with China. Ross has told CNBC that delaying a trade deal with China until after the 2020 election could make sense, as it \u201ctakes leverage away\u201d from Beijing. That chimes with Donald Trump\u2019s comments in London earlier. Ross added that no high-level meetings are planned between the two sides, even though the US will impose new tariffs on 15 December unless there\u2019 s a deal.... Wall Street is having a seriously bad day now, with the Dow shedding 421 points or 1.5%. This takes the index down to a one-month low, wiping out all the gains made in November when the Dow hit a series of record highs. Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s press conference in London is one of the most awkward such events we\u2019ve seen in a while. At one stage, Trump even patronised Macron for giving a classic \u201cnon-answer\u201d, when the French president talked about the importance of eradicating ISIS. That came after Trump challenged him to take back French Islamist fighters captured in the region. But on trade, Trump has also threatened France with \u201csubstantial taxes\u201d, unless it changes its plan to tax tech giants. \u201cWe\u2019ve taxed wine and we have other taxes scheduled. We\u2019d rather not do that, but that\u2019s the way it would work. So it\u2019s either going to work out, or we\u2019ll work out some mutually beneficial tax,. The tax will be substantial, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to come to that but it might.\u201d The two leaders are also clashing over Turkey, with Macron furious that it plans to buy a Russian missile system, and over its invasion of Syria. Donald Trump has sent another shiver through the markets, as he tells reporters in London that Europe isn\u2019t trading fairly with the US. The US president says his country \u201ccannot continue to lose the money that it has lost\u201d since the EU was created. We have an unfair trade situation with the EU. This further hardens concerns that Trump is ratcheting up his threats to impose more tariffs if European countries don\u2019t address American concerns. Ouch! America\u2019s stock market has fallen 1% at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average: down 285 points at 27,497 S&amp;P 500: Down 32 points at 3,081.84 points Donald Trump\u2019s warning that a trade deal with China might not happen before next November\u2019s presidential election has alarmed traders, as has the prospect of a trade war with France. Trump then repeats his earlier argument that it\u2019s wrong for France to tax US companies, through its digital services tax. [America\u2019s complaint is that the French plan is based on the revenues of US tech firms, not simply the profits they make in France] Newsflash: Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron are holding a press conference at the NATO summit now. Trump seems to be trying to calm the tariff row, telling reporters that \u201cwe have a very good relationship with France\u201d. The US president also says that he believes the two sides can work out their clash over France\u2019s digital sales tax. Thins s will \u201cbe looking rose\u201d between us soon, he adds. But, Trump is also emphasising that all NATO members need to make a fair contribution to its budget, and suggests that he could use trade as a weapon to get them into line... France\u2019s wine and spirits industry is calling on Emmanuel Macron to help. Antoine Leccia, chairman of trade body FEVS says the threat of champagne tariffs at the US border must be pushed back: \u201cFor six weeks now, our companies have been strongly affected by the Airbus litigation. We must avoid creating new problems. \u201cWe therefore solemnly call on the President of the Republic to take, from today, all the necessary initiatives, at national, bi-lateral and international levels, so that our sector does not pay the price of the economic and political choices made by France\u201d. A EU delegation to the US says it will seek \u201cimmediate talks\u201d on how to resolve the dispute over France\u2019s digital service tax, Reuters reports. If you missed it earlier, here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Trump criticising France\u2019s new levy on the revenues of US technology giants: The Paris stock market is also suffering a dose of tariff blues. The CAC 40 index is down 1%, with consumer companies and factories suffering the biggest losses. Luxury goods firm Kering is down 2.3%, with LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton) losing 2%. As explained earlier, they\u2019re in the firing line from higher tariffs on handbags and champagne. The US stock market is also heading for sharper losses in an hour\u2019s time: Just in: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top shares has hit its lowest level since late October. The Footsie has now lost 108 points to 7,177, its weakest level in six weeks. Donald Trump\u2019s latest trade war escalation is causing alarm in the City, as traders fear that a deal with China could be a year away. The new tariffs being threatened on France have also raised worries that UK-EU relations could worsen. Separately, the the rise in the pound is hurting multinationals - whose overseas earnings become less valuable in sterling terms. Steelmaker Evraz is the top faller, down 6%, followed by NMC Health, the UAE-focused healthcare chain. US-focused plumbing and building materials provider Ferguson has lost 3%, while global advertising firm WPP is down 2.5%. Data firm Panjiva has calculated that America\u2019s new proposed tariffs cover 4.1% of all French exports to the US, worth just over $2.4bn. Cosmetics takes the biggest hit, followed by sparkling wine. It explains: The largest import lines were: beauty products worth $842 million; champagne where imports were worth $806 million; handbags worth $434 million and; dairy products worth $202 million. While shares slide, the pound is rising towards its highest level in six months. Sterling has just hit $1.30 for the first time in six weeks, and is close to levels not seen since May. The pound often rises when opinion polls suggest Boris Johnson will win a majority next week. The latest poll shows the Conservative Party still holds a lead over Labour. The pound is also benefitting from the weaker dollar, which took a hit from disappointing US manufacturing data yesterday. Agathe Demarais, Global Forecasting Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, suspects that Donald Trump won\u2019t actually impose those new tariffs on French champagne, cheese, handbags and cosmetics. Why? Because it would drive up prices in the shops - not a good idea in an election year. Demarais says: The fact that the proposed US tariffs would target consumer goods will restrain Mr Trump from moving forward with these actions. Targeting French consumer goods, such as champagne and luxury items, would make these tariffs personal for US consumers; this is something that Mr Trump will want to avoid before the US 2020 presidential election as it could hurt his re-election chances. But even so, the threat shows that US-European relations are weakening: France has vowed to retaliate at the European level against the US proposed tariffs. Overall, this new row illustrates the ongoing deterioration of the relationship between the US and its traditional European allies, and France in particular. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills points out that the UK could soon have its own digital services tax -- it\u2019s in the Conservative manifesto! Labour has also promised to tax US tech giants more, to better reflect the profits they make in the UK. We flagged up earlier that the US is threatening to sanction Italy over its digital tax scheme, following last night\u2019s move against France. Could the UK be next?... This tweet shows the moment when Trump\u2019s comments on China hit the wires, and rattled the Wall Street futures market: Investors are very disappointed by the prospect of waiting another year for a US-China trade deal, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Markets simply aren\u2019t priced for this; for a trade deal to be that far in the future \u2013 if one can even be struck at all. After weeks of making generally positive noises on a deal being very close, there is a real sense now that a deal is not so very near at all and markets need to reprice. Combined with the barrage of tariff threats on the EU, the comments can be taken as a sign that the White House has no qualms about levying further tariffs and is happy about using trade as a economic, political and diplomatic weapon. Of course, Donald Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip comments in these kind of interviews need to be taken with a dose of salt \u2013 we could just as easily see him row back on this later, as has happened countless times already. We\u2019re only ever a tweet away from saying that a deal is very close to see a rebound. However, it\u2019s clear that hopes for even a skinny deal being done this year have diminished in the last two days and markets are reflecting this. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-size companies, has shed 0.8% today. That\u2019s a fall of 167 points today, to 20,531 - its lowest level in over a week. Investors are now worrying that America might impose another swathe of tariffs on China in two weeks time. President Trump has previously threatened to impose 15% levies on $160 billion of Chinese imports on December 15, if a trade deal hadn\u2019t been reached by then. Markets had been expecting America to hold fire, but Trump\u2019s comments on China today may prompt a rethink. And that could spook markets badly. As Bloomberg reported: \u201cIf tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 are implemented it would be a huge shock to the market consensus,\u201d said Sue Trinh, managing director for global macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management in Hong Kong. \u201cTrump would be the Grinch that stole Christmas,\u201d she said. The US stock market is now expected to open lower, following Donald Trump\u2019s un-urgent comments about China. The Dow is tipped to drop by around 0.3%, according to the futures market. Yesterday it shed almost 1%, after the president slapped Brazil and Argentina with tariffs on their steel and aluminium exports to America. Donald Trump has alarmed investors by declaring that he\u2019s really in no rush to reach a trade deal with China. In London, the FTSE 100 has slumped by 81 points or over 1% to 7,203 points, its lowest level in almost two weeks. Mining stocks are leading the selloff, as a deeper trade war between Washington and Beijing is bad news for commodity prices. Boom! Donald Trump has suggested that a trade deal with China could be a year away. Asked if it could be agreed by the end of 2019, he replies that any deal is dependent on one thing - whether he wants to do it. The president claims that America is doing \u201cvery well\u201d from the trade war, citing the $28bn financial aid handed to US farmers. He claims this came from the tariffs paid by China -- even though tariffs are actually paid by American companies when they import goods from China. Trump then accuses China of \u201cripping off the US for many, many years\u201d, and now being desperate to end the trade war. He adds: In some ways I think it\u2019s better to wait until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now. That may alarm investors, who had been hoping for a Phase One trade deal for a while. The next US election is in November 2020..... Trump also said he is doing \u201cvery well\u201d with trade talks with China, even though a Phase One trade deal hasn\u2019t been reached yet. Just in: Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on France\u2019s digital tax, and its president Emmanuel Macron. Speaking at the start of the NATO meeting in London, the US president says France is wrong to hit American tech companies with a 3% levy on their global revenues. Trump says he\u2019s \u201cnot in love\u201d with Facebook, Google and Twitter - although he does do well on Twitter. But they are \u201cour companies, American companies\u2019, so he wants to be the one taxing them. He tells reporters: I\u2019m not going to let anyone take advantage of American companies. If anyone is going to take advantage of American companies, it\u2019s going to be us..... I don\u2019t want France to be taxing American companies. If anyone\u2019s going to tax American companies, it\u2019s us. So we\u2019re putting a tax on their [France\u2019s] wines and everything else. Trump also criticises Macron, saying that sometimes the French president does things that are \u201ccounterproductive to his country\u201d. He also says it was \u201cvery insulting\u201d of Macron to label NATO as \u201cbrain-dead\u201d, adding that European history shows that \u201cno-one needs NATO more than France\u201d. The list of French products that could incur a 100% tariff runs to 63 entries, covering food, drink, fashion, cosmetics and accessories. It includes 22 different entries for cheese alone, including: Fresh cheese, Roquefort, Edam, blue-veined, Gruyere, Romano, Reggiano, Parmesan and Swiss varieties. Even cheddar is mentioned, even though that\u2019s more of a UK delicacy. The list also includes \u201cSparkling wine, made from grapes\u201d, which appears to covers France\u2019s champagne production as well as cr\u00e9mant - or fizz from other regions. On toiletries, the list includes Lip make-up, eye make-up, manicure or pedicure preparations, beauty or make-up powders, and various soaps. It also targets handbags, both with and without shoulder straps, whether they\u2019re made of \u2018reptile leather\u2019, patent leather, braid, silk, plastic or other manmade fibres. The US Trade Representative has also singled out 13 types of porcelain and china, including ranges for hotels and restaurants, and for households. It also singles out decanters, punch bowls, salt and pepper sets, mugs and steins. Finally, the list includes cast iron table and kitchen products, which could cover Le Creuset-style pots. You can read America\u2019s ruling against France here. In it, the US Trade Representative explains that the digital tax is unfair because it discriminates against U.S. digital companies, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. In addition, the French DST is inconsistent with prevailing tax principles on account of its retroactivity, its application to revenue rather than income, its extraterritorial application, and its purpose of penalizing particular U.S. technology companies The US is also threatening to launch similar probes into Austria, Italy, and Turkey. Trade representative Robert Lighthizer said America wants to tackle \u201cgrowing protectionism\u201d..... \u201cIndeed, USTR is exploring whether to open Section 301 investigations into the digital services taxes of Austria, Italy, and Turkey. The USTR is focused on countering the growing protectionism of EU member states, which unfairly targets U.S. companies, whether through digital services taxes or other efforts that target leading U.S. digital services companies.\u201d Rome\u2019s government has proposed a similar digital tax, which would begin in January 2020, taxing large tech firms 3% of their revenue. Shares in French luxury goods makers are dropping, due to the threat of higher tariffs on their goods. LVMH, which produces Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon (yummy!) have fallen 1.5% on the Paris stock market. Kering, which owns Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, has shed 1.3%, while cosmetics company L\u2019Or\u00e9al has dipped by 0.3%. Critics of trade wars point out that tariffs are effectively a tax on consumers, as they make imports more expensive. And if America really does impose this 1o0% tariff, it could mean less French champagne and quality cheese is quaffed and scoffed in the States. Paul Donovan of UBS fears that Camembert will be off the menu, replaced with processed cheese (and you can\u2019t bake that in the oven with a little garlic and herbs!). He told clients: US President Trump tweeted plans to tax US consumers of French champagne and cheese (and other goods). The sentiment seems to be \u201clet them drink Coke.\u201d Taxing trade is one of the few things the US president can do alone. Trump is branding the Democrats as \u201cdo nothing\u201d \u2013 we may get more such tweets as a demonstration Trump is \u201cdoing something.\u201d Substituting Kraft Cheese Slices for Camembert may be a heavy burden. However, earlier tweets re-imposing taxes on US users of Brazilian and Argentinian steel seem even more serious. Companies have spent years believing that they can operate global supply chains. Trust in global supply chains is threatened when a Trump trade deal does not seem to last more than a few months. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has opened lower, as trade war jitters ripple through the City. Mining companies are among the top fallers, with Anglo American losing almost 2%. A trade war can mean lower demand for commodities such as iron ore and coal. Holiday firms TUI and Carnival, who are also vulnerable to a growth slowdown, are in the red too. Paris is also refusing to abandon its new digital tax plan, despite America\u2019s threats. Junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher has declared that France will be \u201cpugnacious\u201d over the issue. She told Sud Radio a little while ago that: \u201cIt is very clear that we do not need to go back on this, with regards to a topic that economically speaking makes sense. We need to be pugnacious on the subject. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Back in July, France decided to impose a new 3% levy on digital companies with global revenues of more than \u20ac750m (\u00a3685m). It is meant to tackle the issue of major American companies paying little corporation tax in Europe, because they declare most of the profits back in the US. The French government is furieux about America\u2019s threat to impose a 100% tariff on some of its most cherished exports. Finance minister Brune Le Maire has told Radio Classique that the move is \u201cunacceptable\u201d, and not what you\u2019d expect from an ally. Le Maire also warned that Europe would retaliate, presumable with its own raft of tariffs on American imports. \u201cIn case of new American sanctions, the European Union would be ready to riposte\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So much for the season of goodwill! Donald Trump has spooked the financial markets again, with a fresh flurry of tariffs that further escalate his trade war war. Overnight, the Trump administration on Monday proposed new tariffs up to $2.4bn of French goods. Prized exports, including champagne, cheese, handbags, porcelain, cheeses and yoghurt would incur a new levy of up to 100%. This swingeing move is a retaliation against France\u2019s new digital services tax, which Washington says unfairly discriminated against American technology companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declared that the move: \u201csends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on US companies.\u201d The move casts a shadow over today\u2019s meeting of NATO leaders in London, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the military alliance. The attack on French exporters came just hours after Trump announced he was raising tariffs on steel and aluminium from Brazil and Argentina, in retaliation for their currencies falling to record lows. That knocked stocks across the globe, with European stock markets suffering their worst day in two months on Monday. Wall Street also suffered, with the Dow losing almost 1%. The selloff is now spreading to Asia, where Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has slumped by over 2%. Hopes that Trump might secure a trade deal with China had driven markets higher in recent weeks; investors are now worrying that America could take a more belligerent approach. Tariffs restrict trade and drag on global growth, so any escalation is bad news for the global economy. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says Trump\u2019s latest barrage of tariffs has surprised the markets. The US placing steel and aluminium tariffs on Argentina and Brazil caught markets off guard. Traders have had US-China trade tunnel vision. As Americans would say, this came out of left field. The new tariffs in South America are a reminder that with Trump as US President, a phase one trade deal with China doesn\u2019t mean global trade just resets to the old status quo. As I type, France is vowing to hit back, so it could be a tense day....
