While advertising and media planning and buying have been adversely affected by the economic downturn, the aftermath of September 11 and global uncertainty over a possible war with Iraq has hit WPP's PR companies even harder. The results confirmed the dominance of below-the-line and niche marketing services such as public relations which now account for the majority - 53.5% - of WPP turnover. \"In constant currencies, the group's public relations and public affairs revenue continued to be most affected by the recession, particularly in technology, media and telecommunications, declining by 8%,\" said WPP in its full-year results statement to the City. But it maintained that some of its PR agencies had responded well to the challenging environment. \"Burson-Marsteller, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Robinson Lerer &amp; Montgomery in the United States, and Finsbury and Buchanan in the United Kingdom performed well,\" the company said. And after WPP's PR businesses reported a 6.7% decline in underlying revenues in 2001, the group said cost-cutting had resulted in an improvement in operating margins this year. \"Following the decline in revenues in 2001, and 2002, the public relations and public affairs businesses reduced their costs significantly and as a result operating margins before associates improved by over one margin point in 2002.\" The difficult economic climate has proved barren ground for PR companies, whose fees have been squeezed by clients desperate to wring maximum value out of their marketing services agencies in the face of budget cutbacks. PR companies also found in 2002 that clients increasingly employed them on a project-by-project basis, mirroring the economic uncertainty in their own groups, rather than on the more stable ongoing contract basis. The continuing downwards trends within WPP's PR businesses could force the advertising giant to take a long hard look at how its companies are structured. WPP last summer appointed Howard Paster, the head of its PR agency Hill &amp; Knowlton, to oversee all of its public relations brands in an effort to kick-start its performance in the recession-hit sector. However, Mr Paster immediately dismissed speculation of a merger of WPP's PR agencies, which include Hill &amp; Knowlton, Burson-Marsteller, Cohn &amp; Wolfe and Finsbury, insisting they would remain separate. But whether WPP will keep steadfastly to this line after suffering yet another revenue decline remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
