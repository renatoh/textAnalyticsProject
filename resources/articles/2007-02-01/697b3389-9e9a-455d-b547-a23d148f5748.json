Had my grumbles - crumbling pavements, potholed roads, blocked drains - been miraculously addressed overnight? Of course not. Perhaps over-cynically, I muttered about \"lies, damned lies, and CPA ratings\". This performance process has always given a partial picture of local government. In 2000, it was to be part of a bargain between Whitehall and town hall, in which councils would receive more \"freedom and flexibilities\" in return for tough inspection. Ministers have yet to deliver, although a white paper last autumn, precursor to a local government bill, has promised more powers \"for local government and local people to shape their own communities\". Recognising that small armies of town hall officials have been assigned to serving inspectors, the communities and local government secretary, Ruth Kelly, has promised that the CPA regime will be slimmed down, with 1,200 national indicators slashed to 200. The problem with criticising the complex inspection regime is that its supporters can easily respond by arguing that it has certainly forced up standards in some laggardly authorities. And few would argue against some form of independent inspection to keep councils on track. Last week, 79% of all-purpose unitary and county councils achieved either four-star (the top score) or three-star ratings from the Audit Commission. But did the latest CPA inspection, which cost the Audit Commission \u00a36m this year and councils considerably more, finally answer a key complaint - namely, that the regime has so far failed on two fronts? First, it has barely tapped the views of consumers - council taxpayers who fund a quarter of local government - on the quality of services in particular areas. And, second, by not examining all services in the round in 34 two-tier county council areas - where 238 districts also handle functions from housing and local planning to street cleaning and refuse collection - CPA is simply not giving an accurate picture of performance. While the commission says the inspection process now embraces \"user satisfaction surveys\" to gauge local opinion, some observers - me included - doubt whether consumerism lies at the heart of a regime built on meeting performance targets rather than judging efficiency, at least partly, on the everyday experiences of council taxpayers. Those taxpayers are certainly short-changed in some two-tier areas, like mine, where electors can be forgiven for wondering which authority - county or district - is responsible for delivering important services. Why should local taxpayers be expected to distinguish between, say, Durham county council and Durham city council? The former looks after education, social care and roads; the latter cleans the streets maintained by the county and handles local plans that have to chime with transport plans set by the county. It is confusing and messy for everyone. Last year, the then local government minister, David Miliband, used Norfolk as an example of the \"confusion, inefficiency and cost\" of two-tier local government. It has one county council, seven districts and 21 market towns. Time for change, cried the minister. But it was a hollow cry. Now the government is backing away from wholesale reorganisation, which means that the two-tier system will lumber on while 84 unitary and metropolitan councils set the pace for local government, providing joined-up services people in the 34 shire counties can only dream about. They deserve a better deal, and CPA has failed them so far. \u00b7 Peter Hetherington writes on community affairs and regeneration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
