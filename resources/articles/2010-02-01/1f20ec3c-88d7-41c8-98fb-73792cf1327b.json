It was a close-run competition, and in the end the factors that decided the public vote were likely to have been very subjective. The qualities that attract you to a dancer are often as unquantifiable as those that make you fall for anyone else \u2013 personality, physical presence, a smile. As far as I was concerned, the outstanding winner was hip-hop maestro Tommy Franzen; were I a more dedicated viewer, the quality that would have made me pick up the phone for him was his musicality. He had it in spades, while Charlie, as the judges acknowledged, sometimes had trouble keeping to the beat. Musicality is a much-touted asset when it comes to dance, but one that's very hard to pin down. At a very basic level, it's about being able to move in time with the music; there are some dancers who are intuitively much better at this than others, like singers who can naturally carry a tune. But it's also about a receptivity to music, a way particular dancers have of seeming to listen, intently, with their bodies and of playing with what they're hearing. Certain Russian ballerinas do this in an exaggerated style, forcing the orchestra to speed up and slow down to their own inner rubato. Even among less flamboyant dancers, there are always one or two \u2013 Alina Cojocaru and Akram Khan, for instance \u2013 who stand out as having an uncanny gift when it comes to interpreting the music they're dancing to, channelling the melody or rhythm so that you can see as well as hear it. The issue of musicality is still there when a dancer performs in silence or against an abstract soundtrack. The same instincts are still in play: the capacity to listen out for the stresses, the dynamics, the pulse of the movement. And when you see an expert, the effect can be far more awesome than the most beautifully gymnastic body. Merce Cunningham, even in his 60s, could be as articulate as a Shakespearean actor, as expressive as a concert pianist, when he danced to his own private music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
