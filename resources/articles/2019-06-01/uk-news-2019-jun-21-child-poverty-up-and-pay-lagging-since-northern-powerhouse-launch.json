Research by the thinktank IPPR North also found there had been a \u00a33.6bn cut in public spending in the north since 2010, compared to a \u00a34bn rise in the south. In interviews to mark five years since George Osborne, then chancellor, unveiled his plan to rebalance the UK\u2019s economy, the north\u2019s political leaders said the project had \u201chalted\u201d with little sign of it being revived. Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor for the Tees Valley, said his region had benefited massively from devolution but the northern powerhouse agenda had \u201cdemonstrably dropped down the list of priorities\u201d under Theresa May\u2019s premiership. \u201cThe only reason the northern powerhouse worked is that you had George Osborne at Treasury driving it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo deliver the northern powerhouse you\u2019ve got to have those levers at Treasury that you can pull to make it work \u2026 The new leader of the Conservative party is going to have to address that issue and make sure that it\u2019s put back on the map.\u201d The northern powerhouse agenda has delivered some important successes, notably the introduction of metro mayors covering half of the north of England, and the creation of Transport for the North, which has a \u00a370bn investment plan for the region\u2019s beleaguered railways. IPPR North said economic growth was marginally higher in the north compared to the national average, and the productivity gap between north and south had narrowed slightly. However, the thinktank\u2019s research suggests that life for many people in the north has not improved since 2014. In the past five years weekly pay has increased by only \u00a312 in the north, compared with \u00a319 nationally in real terms, and the number of jobs that pay less than the living wage of \u00a39 an hour has risen by 150,000 or 10.9%. The research found there were 37,000 fewer public sector jobs in the north than there were 10 years ago. Sarah Longlands, the director of IPPR North, said the northern powerhouse agenda had helped build momentum around the need to address the UK\u2019s inequalities, but \u201cit has failed to tackle fundamental challenges like child poverty, insecure work and poor health.\u201d Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, said it was \u201creally scandalous\u201d that so many more northern children were now living in poverty \u2013 many of whom had at least one parent in work. \u201cThey have been hit by a double whammy. Yes there is more employment, but the work is insecure and working people are often still relying on benefits, which have been cut,\u201d she said. Council leaders said the extra investment brought by devolution could not plug the gap from the swingeing cuts to local authority funding started by Osborne\u2019s austerity programme in 2010. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, said his local authority had lost \u00a3440m a year in funding from central government. \u201cDevolution has halted and it\u2019s not delivering because the money we\u2019re getting is not making up for what\u2019s been taken away from us through austerity,\u201d he said. Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council for 23 years, said any money Greater Manchester had received as a result of devolution \u2013 such as \u00a3243m from the \u201ctransforming cities fund\u201d, which the mayor, Andy Burnham, has spent on trams and walking and cycling \u2013 could not make up for the \u00a3372m of cuts he had had to make since 2010. \u201cBut some money is better than no money,\u201d he shrugged. In the Tees Valley, Houchen highlighted the return of the local airport to public ownership and his new \u00a3600m investment plan for the region as some of the successes of the northern powerhouse. However, he said that with the government distracted by Brexit, the project had drifted despite the efforts of the northern powerhouse minister, Jake Berry. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how senior a minister is, you have No 10 and No 11 [Downing Street] and if those two offices don\u2019t believe in the northern powerhouse, it\u2019s very difficult to make real progress,\u201d he said. In Leeds, Blake has been trying and failing for the past two years to persuade the government to back a One Yorkshire devolution deal that would bring together the county. \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t got is a champion in government to lay out our vision,\u201d she complained. She said the government had given northern leaders a say in certain things \u2013 such as the conditions of the current rail franchises for Northern and Transpennine \u2013 but had failed to sign off crucial accompanying infrastructure investments that would make the franchises work. Some platforms at Leeds station have still not been extended to accept longer trains, and modernisation plans for Manchester Piccadilly and Oxford Road stations are still sitting on the desk of the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. In addition, Blake said there was a serious question mark over whether Northern Rail would fulfil its franchise commitment to phase out the much-derided Pacer trains by the end of the year. Jim O\u2019Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist who was a key architect of the northern powerhouse, said the initiative had suffered from the \u201cWhitehall policy vacuum of the last three years\u201d. Lord O\u2019Neill and Osborne went on numerous trade delegations overseas to promote the northern cities. \u201cNow when I travel to China or wherever, people say: whatever happened to the northern powerhouse?\u201d he said. He criticised Burnham and other mayors for spending too much time moaning and not enough time presenting government with positive ideas. \u201cIn government these guys are viewed as emotional crackpots who are always going on about being the \u2018poor, starving north \u2013 come and help us\u2019,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. Houchen, who is backing Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership contest, said he believed the former foreign secretary was fully behind the northern powerhouse project. He said the next big test for government was whether it pledged support for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a new \u00a339bn east-west railway line, in the autumn spending review. O\u2019Neill agreed. \u201cIt is way more vital than HS2. Without it, government can never show it is taking the north seriously,\u201d he said. Jamie Driscoll, the new Labour mayor of the North of Tyne region, said the government must agree to devolve the shared prosperity fund that will replace European grants. \u201cWe can provide a joined-up strategy \u2013 looking at business, environment, transport and education \u2013 in a way that people in Whitehall can\u2019t.\u201d Currently he has just \u00a320m a year extra to spend as he sees fit. He said the government should devolve the budgets \u201cto the people on the ground who actually know what is going on \u2026 Longer-term, we need independent revenue streams and not be bidding for things but have money directly allocated. In my region, you can\u2019t get here on a motorway. If you want to drive from one side of it to another you have to drive on single-lane roads. If the Department for Transport was based in Newcastle no one would have had to make a proposal, written a paper, lobbied, it would just have happened: we would have a good road network.\u201d A government spokeswoman said: \u201cFive years on, the northern powerhouse remains a priority for the government and is delivering results for people across the north with a record number of people in work and nearly 200,000 more businesses today than in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u00a313bn in improving transport \u2013 more than any government in history \u2013 and, with almost half the region represented by five strong metro mayors, we\u2019re keeping our promise for more decisions in the north to be made by the north.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
