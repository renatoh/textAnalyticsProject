Where their debut album turned heads and bent ears by galvanising Daft Punk's disco template with industrial noise, on Audio, Video, Disco they seem determined to pretend they have uncovered a relic from 1985. But while retooled Twisted Sister and Mr Mister may initially cause you to imagine they have their tongue wedged somewhere in cheek, in referencing the past Gaspard Aug\u00e9 and Xavier de Rosnay have also availed themselves of its melodic possibilities. Audio's many refrains and hooks, not to mention solos, are no less effective for being ersatz; the application of smart songcraft turns them into something richer than the sum of their parts. Richer and louder too. There are at least four top pop songs on this collection and while they may not sound like the future any more, this group have definitely moved forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
