A suitable image for a tournament floored by late collapses, first France and now Romania, and Aidy Boothroyd may not be spared from its domino effect. England, all talk and little substance, are heading home. England\u2019s head coach insisted he would not quit after a must-win game against Romania resulted in a sound beating. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d said Boothroyd, who was given a new two-year contract by the Football Association on the eve of the tournament. \u201cThey will have to carry me out.\u201d That said, serious questions will have to be asked of the head coach given his selections and substitutions contributed significantly to this failure. Two consecutive defeats have been littered with individual errors beyond Boothroyd\u2019s control \u2013 goalkeeper Dean Henderson the latest culprit when he allowed Florinel Coman\u2019s 88th minute daisy-cutter to squirm through his grasp \u2013 but responsibility for this weak performance and early exit rests with the head coach. His decision not to start Phil Foden against Romania backfired spectacularly. England equalised twice in quick succession as they served up another frenzied climax to a Group C fixture but Henderson\u2019s error, followed by another spectacular strike in stoppage time by Coman, ensured Demarai Gray\u2019s and Tammy Abraham\u2019s goals were in vain. Gray had claimed England remained the best squad in the tournament following their defeat by France. Henderson repeated the nonsense after shipping four goals to an average Romania side. The fact is they play Croatia on Monday to decide who is the third best team in the group. \u201cAre we better than Romania? Yes. Are we better than France? Yes,\u201d the Manchester United keeper said in Cesena. \u201cLooking at the squad and players, I still believe we are the best team in the tournament. With the group of players we have really under-achieved. We wanted to come here and win this tournament. Whoever goes on to win the tournament realistically we know we can beat as well. It is a shame. We have let ourselves down. We have let the country down.\u201d That part was true at least. Boothroyd stood by his decision to omit Foden from the starting lineup, explaining he wanted to keep the Manchester City talent fresh for the late stages and avoid the kind of hamstring injury that struck Ryan Sessegnon only 12 minutes after he had replaced Harvey Barnes. England looked threatening onlyonce Foden replaced Sessegnon \u2013 a forced substitution \u2013 and the head coach\u2019s argument was undermined by the 19-year-old\u2019s record of starting 14 club matches this season. The Romania coach, Matei Radoi, stuck with the same XI that beat Croatia 4-1 on Tuesday and was rewarded with an incisive, cohesive and purposeful performance. England were lacking on all counts until a second half improvement instigated by their brightest talent. Asked whether he regretted not starting Foden, Boothroyd replied: \u201cIt is a difficult one to answer. If we\u2019d have taken our chances and gone on to a dramatic victory it would have been the right thing to do. He didn\u2019t start for a reason, because I wanted to make sure he was fresh coming on and not running out of gas at the end. That was my decision. Do I regret it? I think it\u2019s time for reflection from me without making any daft statements. We are disappointed and wish we could have put in a better performance.\u201d Henderson was forced into several early saves as Romania counter-attacked with speed and penetration from the start. Ianis Hagi, son of the great Gheorghe, revelled in the space Hamza Choudhury would usually protect. England had no like-for-like replacement for the suspended defensive midfielder, Kieran Dowell took the role but had little support from Mason Mount or the erratic James Maddison, and Hagi, George Puscas and Dennis Man wreaked havoc in the first half. Romania opened the scoring as England were starting to exert control in the second half. Puscas coolly converted a penalty past Henderson following Jonjoe Kenny\u2019s clumsy foul on the influential substitute Coman. Gray levelled with a fine curling drive only for Hagi to restore Romania\u2019s lead when he pounced on Fikayo Tomori\u2019s weak clearance and found the bottom corner from 20 yards. Abraham, collecting Mount\u2019s inviting cross, gave England hope of a reprieve once more before Coman chanced his luck from distance and wheeled away in delight as the ball slipped through Henderson\u2019s grasp and over the line. An outstanding half-volley from Coman the destroyer confirmed England\u2019s elimination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
