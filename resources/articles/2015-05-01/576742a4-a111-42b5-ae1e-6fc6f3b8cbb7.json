Trevor (Guy Pearce, speaking with his native Australian accent for a change) runs a gym in Austin, Texas, and has an on-off thing with his tightly wound employee Kat (Cobie Smulders). When she takes on new client Danny (Kevin Corrigan), a laidback slob who has suddenly come into a multimillion-dollar inheritance, his romantic overtures prompt her to question what she really wants from life, and that has unexpected repercussions for everyone involved. Although not as strikingly original as Bujalski\u2019s earlier work, there\u2019s something endearing about the characters, the film\u2019s laconic, stoner rhythms and quirky plotting. In the end, it has something wise and kind to say about loneliness and the cult of personal improvement, and it\u2019s hard not to like a movie that features two fat pets \u2013 a dog and cat \u2013 who are proper characters in their own right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
