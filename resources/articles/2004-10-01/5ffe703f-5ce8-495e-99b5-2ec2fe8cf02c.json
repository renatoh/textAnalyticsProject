It is not just because the midfielder spent his early years at Manchester United but because of the awesome performance he gave there for England against Greece in a decisive World Cup qualifier. The 29-year-old returns to the same stage on Saturday hopeful of scaling such heights again. Beckham's international performances have rarely touched them over recent months. His ordinary Euro 2004 has been followed by an average start to this campaign, prompting questions about his leadership and whether he should still be an automatic choice for England. The captain, though, was upbeat yesterday. As he looked ahead to facing Wales, he mentioned not only the inspiration he draws from Old Trafford but that his form for Real Madrid has been positive this season. That has seemingly been missed amid the tumult over Michael Owen and the team's poor start. \"In the games I've played in Spain so far I've been a lot happier with my performances,\" Beckham said. \"I know that I was criticised in the last couple of England games and I accept that. Criticism is part of football. \"But I feel my performances for Real Madrid have been good and I'm hoping that, playing at Old Trafford against Wales in a massive game, I will perform well again. But, if I don't, I'll do what I do in every other game when I don't play well, which is work hard.\" Beckham knows hard work will be a necessity against Wales in any event. He is expecting a physical battle against a team managed by his friend Mark Hughes. \"It's going to be a heated game and everyone knows that,\" he said. \"England-Wales doesn't happen very often and, when it does, it's going to be a tough match.\" Assuming Beckham plays on the right, he faces the tough task of helping to quell Ryan Giggs, a United team-mate for many years. \"It's going to be special,\" he said. \"I have never played against Giggsy before in different teams and it's going to be a nice battle.\" He believes Gary Neville, one of Giggs' current club-mates, will win their duel but noted: \"When Ryan Giggs plays well there are not many better players around. Hopefully he doesn't have a good game but, if he does, then Gary will be up against it.\" Beckham knows what it is like to be up against it from life in Madrid right now. \"I must admit it's not the happiest place to be in the world,\" he said, \"because, when you are not playing well and are losing games, it's not an easy place, especially with Barcelona being up there [top of the table]. But it could be worse. We could be bottom of the league.\" He noted that internationals can be a welcome distraction from club problems and seems to be particularly looking forward to Saturday. \"I love coming back to play at Old Trafford,\" he said. \"It's a special place for me personally and a special place for a lot of players. Anyone who comes to Old Trafford gets an inspiring feeling.\" It would be a fitting place for the captain to rediscover his most inpsiring form for the national side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
