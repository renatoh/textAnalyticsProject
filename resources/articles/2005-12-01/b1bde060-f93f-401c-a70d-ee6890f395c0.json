Or chocolate St Nicholases, or something. They talked about where they were made, where they were sold, and, to top off the segment, had a protracted taste test of little chocolate bishops (with mitre and robes and everything) by a child, a chocolatier, and a real live bishop (with mitre, robes and everything). I tell you, there's nothing more hilarious to a person exposed to too much Narnia at a very early age than the sight of a big proper-looking clergyman happily munching the heads of other, smaller chocolate clergymen. Now that's what I call good television. I have a picture if you'd like to see it. Am I the only person who goes on holiday and takes pictures of the television? Whatever. In the meantime, the only thing that pleases me more than the idea of giant churchmen gleefully eating their brethren is the fact that Peep Show is on tonight, along with a bunch of other stuff. What other stuff, you say? Some other stuff, I say, and you can read on to discover, from the Guide's picks of tonight's TV, exactly what of it is worth watching... The Big Poker Gamble 7pm, BBC2 A look behind the inviting ads splattered across buses and tube trains, promising the chance of winning unfeasible fortunes via online poker sites, an offer so seductive that over a million dollars a minute are staked around the world. Unfortunately, the US department of justice reckons that \"online gaming is against the law\", and the bubble is constantly in danger of being burst by a rather large legal needle. Joss Hutton Bleak House 8.30pm, BBC1 Being in jail needn't be all bad. Held on suspicion of murder, George is at least partially reconciled with his mother, Mrs Rouncewell. Not that Inspector Bucket believes George is guilty. Instead, Bucket, played rather like a Victorian Columbo by the ever impressive Alun Armstrong, holds George as a way of teasing out what's really going on. The best episode to date, with some terrific scenes, particularly the crackling encounter between Mrs Rouncewell and Lady Dedlock. Jonathan Wright The Man-Eating Lions Of Njombe 9pm, BBC2 The claret count is upped significantly in this second dramatised look at the world's most murderous moggies, with Adrian Rawlins as George Rushby, who takes up the position of game keeper in the Njombe region of Tanzania during 1946, only to discover that a pride of lions have eaten more than 1,500 people. Thanks to the local tribe's view that a witch-doctor is behind the killings, and the whole pride addicted to human flesh, this leaves Rushby and his understandably petrified wife in one hell of a pickle. Joss Hutton American Warrior Billy Fiske 8pm, History Channel Born into a wealthy family, American Billy Fiske forsook the pleasures of banking to become a double Olympic bobsleigh champion, entrepreneur and amateur road racer. Then, as the second world war broke out, a love of derringdo and a loathing of Hitler prompted him to lie his way into the RAF in the face of America's neutrality and become a fighter pilot, dying in action at the age of just 29. The almost nauseatingly admirable Fiske's story is well enough told here, though one could do without the constant, low-level soundtrack of stirring, West-Wing type orchestra. David Stubbs Mose Allison: Ever Since I Stole The Blues 9pm, BBC4 Another in BBC4's quality Originals series, this, on pianist Mose Allison, subverts the idea that to be a hip jazz musician you had to be a junkie who died young. Once one of New York's many sidemen, it is as a composer of witty, laconic songs that Mose Allison's reputation rests. Interviewees include Pete Townshend (who explains the link between Mose's Young Man Blues and My Generation) and Frank Black (whose band the Pixies wrote Allison by way of tribute). Star of the show, however, is Mose himself: a mild-mannered janitor, with a highly infectious laugh. John Robinson Calendar Girls (Nigel Cole, 2003) 9.35pm, Sky Movies 1 The story that changed the face of Women's Institute forever is all solid, embarrassed-Brit stuff, as mature Yorkshire ladies Julie Walters and Helen Mirren take the racy decision to strip off for their local WI calendar, and raise heaps of money for charity but problematic publicity for themselves. It clips along, but things start catching up with themselves towards the end, as the girls head for Hollywood. If they went any further, they'd have to include the beginning of the film at the end of it, or have the girls back at home, sitting down to watch this broadcast on TV.
