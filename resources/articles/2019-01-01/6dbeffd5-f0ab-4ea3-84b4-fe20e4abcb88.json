The 27-year-old striker will fly to Italy on Thursday before undertaking a medical test in Genoa the following day. Gabbiadini signed for Southampton in January 2017 from Napoli in a \u20ac17m [\u00a314.6m] deal and he made an explosive start at St Mary\u2019s, scoring six times in his first four matches \u2013 including two in the EFL Cup final defeat by Manchester United. Remarkably, he would go on to score only six more goals and, after coming on as a late substitute in Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s first game in charge \u2013 at Cardiff on 8 December \u2013 he has not been included in any of the manager\u2019s other squads. Gabbiadini, who had never previously played for a club outside of his native Italy, has had plenty of suitors this month across Europe. He has opted for a return to Serie A, where he will hope to drive Sampdoria, who he played for between 2013-2015 to a strong finish. They are seventh in the table, three points off fourth-placed Lazio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
