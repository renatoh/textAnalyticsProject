He\u2019s a stay at home dad, who supports his wife\u2019s career but slags off working women like Annabel Crabb for employing help at home. He\u2019s informed and passionate about ending poverty and disadvantage in western Sydney, yet he picks a fight with anti-domestic violence crusader Rosie Batty. He takes to Twitter under a weird, fake account to troll his enemies, yet in the brilliant Latham Diaries he speaks truth to power. What is he? Who is he? Who is the real Mark Latham? Is it possible that Latham is actually a \u201cbrogressive\u201d? According to the Huffington Post, in a piece dissing bro movie Ted 2, \u201cthe Brogressive is a privileged individual (most often a white, straight, cis male) who outwardly claims to support progressive causes, but insists on doing so without challenging their own comfort or ideas.\u201d Brogressives are a product of a society that has largely absorbed the language, norms and behaviours of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. In this sense, Latham may not fit the bill entirely \u2013 he\u2019s never been particularly political correct, after all \u2013 but he\u2019s got brogressive DNA. What was once progressive has been absorbed into the mainstream. It\u2019s not cool to be the person that doesn\u2019t support marriage equality, or thinks that women should be paid less for the same work as men, or that Australia wasn\u2019t invaded by Europeans. You\u2019ll get shouted down on social media if you hold those views. So the brogressive goes with that flow \u2013 but something in him refuses to budge. It\u2019s the bro within that defines him, but also holds him back. What\u2019s at stake? By following the progressive agenda he has to share his power \u2013 with women, with so-called minorities, with people that in generations past have not had a seat at the boardroom table, or in the corporate box at the football, or in parliament. A cousin of the brogressive is the so-called \u201cBernie bro\u201d: seemingly progressive dudes who support Bernie Sanders, and will take to social media to rant that Hillary Clinton is a liar and a witch. And no \u2013 they are not being sexist because Bernie Bros identify as feminists ... sort of. Brogressives can also be found in literature \u2013 like the man-feminist douchebag protagonist in The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P or the feckless Nino Sarratore from Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neopolitan series. In Australia, you may find them playing goal attack in your mixed netball team, or wearing a white ribbon while voting for a premier that closes down women\u2019s refuges. Here\u2019s how to spot that contradictory but not uncommon species \u2013 the Australian brogressive: Active on social media, changing his profile picture to rainbow colours in support of marriage equality and other progressive causes but still describes bad things as \u201cso gay\u201d. Keenly live tweets the women\u2019s tennis final but kinda thinks Novak Djokovic was right that male players should be paid more than women because more people watch their games. Disapproves of the idea of strippers but the idea of having ANY women at a buck\u2019s night horrifies him. Is into David Foster Wallace and has finished Infinite Jest but has an aversion to novels written by women (even though everyone says Evelyn Waugh is really good). What a time to be alive, because \u2026 Tinder. Objects to women singing It\u2019s Raining Men at karaoke because it makes them look \u201cthirsty\u201d. Finds the Girls episode where Lena Dunham\u2019s character hooks up with a hot doctor unrealistic but thinks the couple from Love are a perfect match. Shared Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech on Facebook but supported Kevin Rudd because he was knifed by \u201cthat woman\u201d. Thinks that Mark Latham being a stay at home dad gives him feminist credibility. Feminism means \u2026 you can exit the elevator first. Invites smart women to his dinner parties but interrupts every time they speak. Apologises before he mansplains but then goes right ahead. Hate-shares Clementine Ford articles with his friends on group chat. Blames \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d for not being able to tell rape jokes during his stand up comedy set. Has a secret Twitter account that he uses to @ opinion writers and columnists who irritate him. Leaves the office early to take care of his children but says he has to go home to \u201cbabysit\u201d. Loves Kendrick Lamar but yells the \u201cn\u201d word at his concerts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
