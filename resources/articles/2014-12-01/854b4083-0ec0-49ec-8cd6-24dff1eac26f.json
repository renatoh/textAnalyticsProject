The administration also ducked the question of whether it would be taking any action against intelligence chiefs alleged to have covered up the extent of prisoner abuse, preferring to focus on the need to restore morale in the agency in the wake of the report and guard against possible reprisals overseas. With President Obama safely in the air on the way to a pre-arranged visit to Kentucky, it was primarily left to anonymous \u201csenior administration officials\u201d to brief the media on his muted response to the damning report. \u201cWe are spending an awful lot of time on the morale of the [CIA] workforce right now,\u201d said one of five senior officials on a background conference call. \u201cThe protection of our people is our top priority,\u201d added another, who said the State Department had put every US posting in the world on heightened security standby in anticipation of the report\u2019s release. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, echoed the relative lack of contrition among US government figures who stressed their distance from the previous policy but unwillingness to hold individuals to account. \u201cI want to underscore that while it\u2019s uncomfortable and unpleasant to re-examine this period, it\u2019s important that this period not define the intelligence community in anyone\u2019s minds,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today\u2019s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong \u2013 in the past,\u201d added Obama in a prepared statement released shortly before the Senate intelligence committee chair, Dianne Feinstein, documented the catalogue of abuses and alleged cover-ups. In a speech in Nashville, the president stuck to a pre-arranged script on immigration reform and did not address the torture report at all. But the administration\u2019s relative silence was in stark contrast to the firestorm in the rest of Washington caused by Feinstein\u2019s tougher-than-expected report. The Republican foreign policy hawk John McCain, himself a victim of torture during the Vietnam war, was damning of the agency, claiming the CIA had \u201cstained our national honour\u201d and \u201cdamaged our security interests as well as our reputation for being a force for good in the world\u201d. The outgoing Democratic Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, was also firmly behind the intelligence committee in the fight against practices he said had \u201cgot us nothing, except a bad name\u201d and were \u201cnot in keeping with our country\u201d. But the CIA and Republican allies in Congress were not taking the criticism lying down. John Brennan, the Bush-era veteran in charge of the agency, issued a statement acknowledging some \u201cshortcomings and mistakes\u201d but vigorously rejected allegations of a systematic cover-up. \u201cOur review indicates that interrogations of detainees on whom enhanced interrogation techniques were used did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives,\u201d he added. \u201cThe intelligence gained from the programme was critical to our understanding of al-Qaida and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day.\u201d Senator Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican on the intelligence committee, published his own report flatly contradicting the principal findings of Democrats and two other members, which he called \u201cerroneous and inflammatory\u201d. \u201cThere is no telling how many lives this programme saved,\u201d said Chamblis, pointing to 766 cases he claimed where \u201csole sourced\u201d intelligence had been extracted, including warning of terrorist attacks on Heathrow airport and London\u2019s Canary Wharf. But the White House insisted it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment on the report\u2019s conclusions about the effectiveness of torture or the past candour of CIA officials with the Bush administration. \u201cI think that\u2019s something we\u2019re not passing judgment on,\u201d said the press secretary, Josh Earnest, during an exchange with reporters on Air Force One, insisting former administration officials should \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d on whether they felt misled. Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who also stood behind the agency after revelations of its domestic surveillance programmes, summed up the ambivalent official response to the torture report. \u201cIn all of my experience in intelligence, I am hard-pressed to recall another report \u2013 and the issues surrounding it \u2013 as fraught with controversy and passion as this one,\u201d he said. \u201cVirtually no one who has any familiarity with the report and what it describes is \u2018neutral\u2019.\u201d Except, that is, perhaps the commander in chief and his administration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
