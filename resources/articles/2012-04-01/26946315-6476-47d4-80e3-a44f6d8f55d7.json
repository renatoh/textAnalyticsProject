Now this public art commission by the mayor of London has sailed into a controversial squall over its overall cost and accusations that the public has paid for it twice. Yinka Shonibare's critically acclaimed wood-and-fabric replica of HMS Victory, the flagship of Admiral Lord Nelson, in a Perspex bottle has cost the public \u00a3535,000. The original \u00a3170,000 commission, \u00a330,000 of which was the artist's fee, was funded by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and Arts Council England. The balance of \u00a3140,000 was for materials and production costs. Ownership of the artwork remained with the artist or his dealer, Stephen Friedman Gallery. However, this month the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich bought the work, for which the public in effect paid a further \u00a3365,000. Of that figure, some \u00a350,000 each came from the museum and the Art Fund, a charity, and \u00a3265,000 was raised as a result of a public appeal. Funds also came from the Henry Moore Foundation, the Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria, and the Cass Foundation. Now the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, is being challenged to explain why the original \u00a3170,000 commission did not involve its ownership \u2013 as would normally be the case for art commissions. David Lee, a leading art critic, said: \"For this large amount we get nothing, apparently, but the rent of a work for a year. This is twice the annual Arts Council grant to most regional museums, a heck of a lot for one work. Can this be considered value for money?\" Sculptor and Royal Academician James Butler said that whenever he has been commissioned, ownership transfers to the people commissioning the work: \"I don't see how you can be paid for a job and then keep it. [This] is a hell of a racket in my view. It beggars belief.\" Shonibare, a sculptor, painter and installation artist, is inspired by his west African heritage and was shortlisted for the 2004 Turner Prize. His fourth plinth workfeatures 37 sails made of richly patterned textiles commonly associated with African dress and symbolic of African independence. His Victory comments on the legacy of British colonialism. The Art Fund says \u00a3650,000 is the work's value, which was reached by including a \"discount\" by Friedman of \u00a397,500 and a \u00a349,100 \"contribution\" by Friedman and a New York gallery \u2013 dismissed as a \"whitewash\" by Lee. Friedman's spokeswoman claimed that production costs were \"at least double\" the \u00a3140,000, though she declined to be specific. She said that the additional \u00a3140,000 was sponsored by the Nigerian bank and others. While no reflection on the artist's workmanship \u2013 which one critic called \"exhilarating\" \u2013 criticism has been exacerbated by the assessment of the maritime museum and the Art Fund, which led the fund-raising appeal, that the artwork is worth \u00a3650,000, when Shonibare's auction record is only \u00a3130,000. In effect, given that the public paid \u00a3535,000 for the work, of which production was \u00a3140,000, the gallery's and artist's share was \u00a3395,000. An Art Fund spokeswoman said that \u00a3650,000 reflected the price the artwork could have brought in open market, and Friedman claimed to \"have had several offers\" at that level. The museum, which houses a rich collection on Britain's maritime history, particularly on Nelson and Trafalgar, also took two \"independent\" valuations. However, the fact that both were from commercial dealers, the Haunch of Venison and Roche Court, failed to impress Lee. When asked by the Observer why the contract for the original commission did not pass ownership to it, and whether it had stipulated any refund if the work were sold, a GLA spokesman first said: \"I think there's a contract.\" When pressed for the terms he said only that the GLA \"seeks\" to recoup. Lee, editor of the art journal The Jackdaw, expressed astonishment that the GLA had apparently not been scrupulous in dictating the terms as, without proper conditions, dealers had considerable scope for exaggerating prices. A figure of \u00a3140,000 is the standard funding for all the plinth works, regardless of actual costs. The commission was part of a series of displays for the 1840s plinth. Other exhibitors have included Marc Quinn. The GLA confirmed that none of its other plinth commissions has yet been sold, prompting Lee to comment: \"I think by any definition this is a rip-off.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
