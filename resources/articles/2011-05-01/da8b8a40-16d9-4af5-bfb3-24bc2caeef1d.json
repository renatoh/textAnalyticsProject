Birmingham are one goal above the relegation zone but are among the five teams at risk of going down with West Ham United as the season heads for a dramatic and, for some, devastating conclusion. The scramble for survival is as frantic as the permutations are plentiful: depending on other results in the season's final round of matches, Birmingham could stay up if they lose at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday and go down if they win. Phillips, of course, knows that the best approach is to aim for an improbable victory and do the calculations afterwards. \"All we can do is affect our own situation, we aren't going to worry about the others,\" said the 37-year-old. \"There is no reason why we can't go to White Hart Lane and put on a performance but it has to be the performance of our lives.\" Birmingham put on what was considered the performance of many of their younger supporters' lives when they beat Arsenal at Wembley in February to end a 48-year wait for a major trophy but their form has dipped disturbingly since then and a run of two wins in 12 matches has pushed them to the edge of the relegation precipice. Go down and the gloss will be taken off their trophy, warns Phillips, who has been demoted in the past with both Sunderland and Southampton and knows that relegation not only dents pride but can also lead to job losses among playing and non-playing staff. \"Of course it will [take the gloss off the Carling Cup]. Our bread and butter is the Premier League. It's not just for the club, it's for every individual, for their careers. I've been relegated twice from the Premier League and it's not nice. It has a knock-on effect on everyone. We know that. We are not daft. For a club like Birmingham they need to stay in the Premier League. It will be a huge day for us next Sunday.\" Birmingham seemed paralysed by nervousness during their abject 2-0 home defeat by Fulham on Sunday but Phillips remains confident that he and his team-mates will surmount the jitters for the high-stakes showdown with Tottenham, who need to win to be sure of finishing fifth. \"We've got a massive job to do but we can do it, it's in there. We've got to lift ourselves and go again. We have to, simple as that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
