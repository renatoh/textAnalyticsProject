Tiger Woods is here in all his tarnished glory but for once the world No1 is not the centre of the golfing universe, having ceded his anointed spot yesterday to Rory McIlroy. It takes a lot to impress professionals but the Ulsterman's stunning victory at the Quail Hollow Championship on Sunday, which came courtesy of a final-round 62, 10-under par, has left the great and good of the game scrambling to find the appropriate comparisons. \"Incredible,\" decreed Phil Mickelson, who finished second behind McIlroy in North Carolina and who, it turned out, was only warming up on the superlative front. \"As we go back [next month] to the US Open at Pebble Beach,\" Mickelson said, \"it reminds of the best performance I have ever seen, which was Tiger in the US Open in 2000.\" Woods won that tournament by 15 strokes, still the record margin of victory in a major. Johnny Miller, the sage of US television coverage, shot a final-round 63 to win the US Open at Oakmont in 1973 and compared McIlroy's effort to his. \"That 62 is one of the great non-major championship performances in my time on Tour,\" he said. \"It reminded me of my Oakmont round. It had the magic going. This could open the gates for Rory. He could be the next great player. He's the kind of guy who's hard not to like.\" Talk about 62 shots heard around the world. The sense of wonder over McIlroy's performance is palpable, as are the expectations it has fuelled, although the player himself tried hard to repel the tide. \"Knowing that I beat a great field there on basically a major championship venue, especially with the likes of Phil and Angel [Cabrera] coming behind me, and to hold them off and play great golf like that down the stretch just gives me that belief if I can do it there I can pretty much do it anywhere,\" he said. \"I don't want to get myself too carried away.\" Others are not so reticent, not least because of what is going on with Woods, whose game seems to be in tatters and whose place at the head of the hierarchy has never looked so vulnerable. In the short term if Mickelson, ranked second in the world, wins this week and Woods finishes outside the top five, the left-hander takes over as world No1. We have been here before \u2013 David Duval and Vijay Singh have supplanted Woods in the past \u2013 but on both occasions Woods was changing his swing, and had chosen to get worse in order to get better. This time around he looks lost, with his swing and with life. Woods being Woods he will find a way back, of course, but when he does return to form he will find the landscape has changed, with a more assertive and confident Mickelson and a welter of young players ready to take him on such as the 18-year-old Ryo Ishikawa, who shot a final-round 58 on Sunday to win in Japan, and McIlroy. Yet if the Ulsterman, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Tuesday at a surprise party organised by his caddie JP Fitzgerald, would happily beat Woods this week and every week, he came yesterday not to bury the man he called an \"inspiration\" but to praise him. \"I think I speak on behalf of all the younger players when I say that Tiger was the guy we all looked up to and the guy that we followed,\" he said. \"He is the reason that the likes of myself and Ryo and Anthony Kim have flourished at such a young age, because Tiger set the benchmark so high.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
