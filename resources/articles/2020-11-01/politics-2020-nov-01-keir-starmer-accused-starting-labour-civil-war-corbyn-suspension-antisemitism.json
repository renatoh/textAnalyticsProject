A union leader has accused Starmer of using the issue to pursue a \u201ccivil war\u201d within the party, and joined with six other union bosses in issuing a joint statement describing the suspension of Corbyn as \u201cunjust\u201d. The unions\u2019 intervention came as antisemitism campaigners seized on Corbyn\u2019s suspension to warn that the party remains \u201cunsafe\u201d for Jewish members until it thoroughly investigates 15 other MPs about whom they have lodged detailed complaints, including deputy leader Angela Rayner. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communications Workers Union, said that he believed the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, which found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination in relation to antisemitism, was \u201cwell-balanced\u201d. However, Ward said the decision to suspend Corbyn \u201creeks of political opportunism\u201d, adding that Starmer had set a bar for suspension that was incompatible with \u201ca fair process\u201d. Labour suspended Corbyn after he claimed that \u201cthe scale of the problem\u201d of antisemitism in the party had been \u201cdramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media\u201d. But Ward said Starmer had \u201cdecided to plunge the Labour party into a civil war of his own making\u201d. \u201cNothing that Jeremy said warranted his suspension,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt was a well-balanced and factual response to an equally well-balanced report. There isn\u2019t space for one antisemite in the Labour party. But if Labour is actually interested in fighting racism, it needs to do so honestly and not through a damaging factional lens.\u201d Ward added: \u201cMinority groups cannot be used as a battering ram for Labour\u2019s factional war.\u201d Yesterday, seven trade unions affiliated to Labour, including Unite, Labour\u2019s largest donor, and the TSSA, which backed Starmer in the party leadership election, released a joint statement, reported on the website LabourList, expressing \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Corbyn\u2019s \u201cill-advised and unjust suspension\u201d and urging the party leadership to \u201crepair this damage\u201d. \u201cAs the general secretaries of trade unions affiliated to the Labour party, we seek to put on record our serious concerns about the manner of and rationale for suspension of the former party leader Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d the statement reads. Having suspended Corbyn, Starmer is coming under acute pressure to take more robust action against 15 other Labour MPs about whom the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), which brought the original complaint that triggered the EHRC investigation, has concerns. The CAA submitted a lengthy dossier to the party about the MPs before Corbyn\u2019s suspension. Now it is calling for swift action against them. \u201cSir Keir has promised to tear out antisemitism \u2018by its roots\u2019,\u201d said Gideon Falter, chief executive of the CAA. \u201cMr Corbyn was just one of those roots. The 15 other sitting MPs who have indulged in or promoted antisemitic discourse are others. Labour is not safe for Jews until these cases are dealt with under a disciplinary process that is independent, fair, transparent and expeditious. We made the original referral of Labour to the EHRC because the party ignored such cases for so long. We have given Sir Keir until the end of his first year in office to finally address our complaints if he wants Jews to be able to return to Labour.\u201d Labour now faces the highly sensitive task of dealing with Corbyn\u2019s case while investigating the other complaints, in what will be the first major test for David Evans, Labour\u2019s new general secretary. Fiona Sharpe, spokeswoman for Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS), said it was clear that Labour\u2019s processes had not been \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and called for a wider, independent review into hundreds of antisemitism complaints. \u201cOver this period, LAAS reported hundreds of apparent party members, providing evidence of Holocaust denial, the use of racially pejorative language, threats of violence and a variety of antisemitic tropes,\u201d she said. \u201cDue to Labour\u2019s appalling mismanagement, many of these members are still active in the party: at local meetings, on councils and even in parliament.\u201d The shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, said that the Labour party would recover from the damning report. \u201cI am sure we will move on as one united party at what is a very very critical time for our country and for people\u2019s lives and livelihoods,\u201d she told BBC Breakfast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
