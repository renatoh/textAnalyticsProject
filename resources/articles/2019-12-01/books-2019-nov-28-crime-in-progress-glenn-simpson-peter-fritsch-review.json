It was conspiratorial. The office in downtown Washington belonged to David Kramer, long time aide to the Republican senator John McCain. His furtive guest was Ken Bensinger, a reporter for BuzzFeed. Kramer had brought with him a series of confidential memos. They concerned Donald Trump, the man who was about to be sworn in as US president, and his murky ties with Russia. Kramer laid them out on the table. In delicate fashion, he then excused himself and said he had to make a phone call and pay a visit to the bathroom. Bensinger whipped out his iPhone. He photographed the papers, one by one. Kramer came back half an hour later. Kramer had served as a US assistant secretary of state under George W Bush and was deeply appalled at the prospect of a Trump presidency. For good measure, he shared the memos with other news organisations and Obama officials. Kramer\u2019s thinly deniable leak ignited a scandal that would consume Washington life for three long years. The memos didn\u2019t quite ease Trump from power. But they did shed light on one of the biggest and longest-running mysteries in 21st-century politics: why is Trump so fulsome and such a suck up when it comes to Vladimir Putin, a KGB guy not over-blessed with charm? The author of the Foggy Bottom dossier was Christopher Steele, a former MI6 officer who spent a career digging up Russia\u2019s dark secrets. His memos alleged that the Kremlin had been sup-porting and cultivating Trump for at least five years. And that in best KGB tradition it had acquired a sizeable amount of Trump kompromat, which could be deployed for blackmail purposes. Steele knew Russia well. He served at the British embassy as the USSR fell apart, and swapped government spying in 2009 for private business intelligence. In spring 2016 a Washington-based research firm, Fusion GPS, got in touch. Might Steele use his network of sources to investigate Trump? Specifically, what Trump had got up to over the years in Moscow? Crime in Progress is billed as the secret history of the Trump-Russia investigation. It is more or less that: an entertaining and readable account of the dossier\u2019s origins, and of the cosmic fall-out once Buzzfeed put it online, to Fusion\u2019s fury. Trump, of course, denies wrongdoing and says he\u2019s the victim of a witch-hunt. He has called Steele a \u201cfailed spy\u201d and Marxist plotter. The book\u2019s authors Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch co-founded Fusion a decade ago. As Wall Street Journal alumni they know how to tell a story. Crime in Progress doesn\u2019t radically alter our understanding of the collusion saga, but there are plenty of colourful details and anecdotes. Once Trump shuffles off stage \u2013 in 2020 or later \u2013 a movie version seems highly likely. Fusion began its own research into Trump in August 2015, at the behest of a Republican client. It found damning open-source evidence: court documents, corporate bankruptcies and ties to organised crime. It turned to Steele to get intelligence from inside Russia. Many strands pointed there. What Steele might find was uncertain. \u201cWe threw a line in the water and Moby-Dick came back,\u201d Simpson writes dryly. According to Crime in Progress, Steele\u2019s first Fusion memo sketched out the Putin-Trump relationship. It included an eye-popping claim that the FSB spy agency \u2013 once directed by Putin himself \u2013 had videoed the future president in a compromising situation. In 2013 Trump had allegedly cavorted with prostitutes at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. The future president had watched a \u201cgolden showers\u201d show, it said. That the FSB bugged hotel rooms in Moscow was an open secret, known to western diplomats and spies. Still, Simpson and Fritsch were stunned. After reading the report, Fritsch exclaimed: \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Simpson said: \u201cI know.\u201d Steele assured them the memo was credible. It drew on seven sources, including a Moscow foreign ministry official, a former Russian intelligence operative, and two witnesses from inside the Ritz. Crime in Progress doesn\u2019t tell us who the sources are, alas. There are a few tantalising clues: a single accomplished \u201ccollector\u201d gathered much of the intelligence, we learn. Steele calls him \u2013 or her \u2013 a \u201cremarkable person with a remarkable story who deserves a medal for services to the west\u201d. Great care was taken to keep identities secret. The fate of Sergei Skripal \u2013 poisoned in Salisbury by a visiting Moscow death squad \u2013 was all too possible. Once it became clear that Trump was in bed with Russians, Steele alerted the FBI and Downing Street. The book claims he had a memorable encounter with Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, in the Garrick Club. Dearlove intimated that the Theresa May government in which Boris Johnson served as foreign secretary was suspicious of Trump\u2019s Moscow ties. It had made a political decision not to \u201cpush the matter further\u201d, Dearlove told Steele. (Dearlove, contacted by the Guardian, has rubbished the book\u2019s account of this meeting) Simpson and Fritsch made their own ultimately doomed attempts to cry fire over Trump and Moscow. They sought out Dean Baquet and David Remnick, editors of the New York Times and New Yorker respectively, the Washington Post\u2019s national security team and other senior US journalists, Crime in Progress alleges. All were interested in the dossier\u2019s explosive content. But publishing it was another matter. The book\u2019s blunt conclusion: the media failed. There was wall to wall coverage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s underwhelming emails, hacked by Russia\u2019s GRU spy agency and given to WikiLeaks. But the more important story \u2013 that Moscow had potentially compromised a White House candidate \u2013 went unwritten. Simpson and Fritsch are scathing about the FBI. On the election\u2019s eve it told the New York Times there was \u201cno clear Trump link to Russia\u201d \u2013 a misleading statement, even in an age of lies. After the dossier leaked, livid Republicans went on the counter-attack. Trump\u2019s allies in Congress denounced Fusion and tried to subpoena its bank records. There were lawsuits from Russian oligarchs, hit-pieces from rightwing US media, cyber-raids. These were bruising times. Simpson acknowledges his firm was in a \u201cshitload of trouble\u201d. With an almost $2m (\u00a31.5m) legal bill it very nearly went under. And what of Robert Mueller? The special counsel\u2019s investigation into collusion was sincere but flawed, the book says. Mueller confirmed Steele\u2019s reporting: that the Russians sweepingly and systematically interfered in the 2016 vote. But Mueller, Simpson and Fritsch argue, didn\u2019t follow the money and was overcautious. In the end he failed to find sufficient evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy, in part because of obstruction by the president and his allies. Three years on, the authors believe the dossier was mostly right. Many of Steele\u2019s allegations have been borne out or have proved \u201cremarkably prescient\u201d, they argue. Others remain \u201cstubbornly unconfirmed\u201d. A handful \u2013 including a claim that Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen met with Russians in Prague \u2013 \u201cappear to be doubtful though not yet disproven\u201d. Cohen and other Trump friends are in jail. In July Mueller gave evidence to Congress. A day later Trump picked up the phone and rang Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The riveting impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill suggest the Ukraine drama is season two to the original Russia boxset: with Trump again soliciting favours from a foreign power in order to smear a political opponent. Another day at the Oval Office, another alleged crime. We wait to find out the denouement. \u2022 Luke Harding\u2019s Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win is published by Guardian Faber.
