On the shared ground that is their home, they went through to the final on the away goals rule. That peculiarity will not distract them from their joy in a piece of superb finishing from Andriy Shevchenko that proved crucial. This side may just be capable of a faint echo of past glories against Juventus or Real Madrid in the final. Admittedly, they scarcely strutted in the desperate closing minutes here when Internazionale equalised and then harried Carlo Ancelotti's team for the first time. On a night of showcase defending from both sides Paolo Maldini suffered a lapse in the 83rd minute when he failed to clear and the substitute Obafemi Martins, with the ball bouncing off his back, turned and brought Inter level. There was terror to follow for Milan, yet only their boldness should be remembered. It takes nerve to be creative with such a prize at stake. Earlier in the season there were paeans to the side that were probably born of the wish that the club should once more have a line-up to compare with the team that contained Franco Baresi, Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco Van Basten. Carlo Ancelotti, the current coach, was part of that group and wavers between idealism and the temptations of practicality. After a period of dreary form, he was prepared to dream anew. His selection here had not only Rui Costa behind the attack but, in Andrea Pirlo, another prompter in a slightly deeper position. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister now and AC Milan's president when they were in their pomp, beamed from his seat in the stand as the lead was established. It must have been a rich pleasure for him to see men such as Maldini and the 37-year-old 'Billy' Costacurta, who earned their fame at the start of the 1990s, make their way towards one last final. Younger footballers have their ambitions too. Seedorf, a former winner with Ajaxand Real Madrid, could make history with a triumph in the Champions League for three different clubs. His present revival ensued after Inter sold him to Milan and the sight of Seedorf back at the pinnacle of the Champions League will make supporters of the Nerazzurra wince even more than would already have been the case after this failure. Their Inter side scorned expressiveness and that is only partially accounted for by the injury that continued to rule out their spearhead Christian Vieri. The coach Hector Cuper is a careful man who likes his player to steal up on their objectives. It was easier to warm to an expansive Milan. In the 45th minute Seedorf fed a pass through on the left. Shevchenko then forced the ball through the legs of Ivan Cordoba and, with the marker tripping him, clipped the ball past Francesco Toldo at the near post as he stumbled. It was the tenth goal this persecutor has struck against Inter. Until then, followers of the club found hope inescapable despite their justified dread of the Ukrainian. Even before kick-off their noise made the seats vibrate. Those Inter fans, unfurling a vast image of a cobra and creating a spectacle with the sparklers they held aloft, had won any battle of showmanship before kick-off. Their side found superiority harder to come by. Cuper's men had not scored in the two Serie A encounters with Milan that preceded the 0-0 draw in the first leg of the semi-final. After the interval, Inter tried to change this match and also their own conservative nature, but Milan, with Alessandro Nesta and Maldini, had a couple of the best defenders in the world at their service. Until the closing passage, the threat from Inter was little more than hypothetical. With a nod towards security, Milan did replace Rui Costa with Massimo Ambrosini, but they had already taken their risks and, despite the fright at the close, seen them pay off.
