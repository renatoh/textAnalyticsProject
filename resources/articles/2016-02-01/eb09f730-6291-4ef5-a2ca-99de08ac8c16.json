She said that despite his lack of a criminal history, his refusal to pay grazing fees going back nearly two decades and his fomenting of the armed standoff made it clear that Bundy has little interest in complying with federal court orders. In court on Tuesday, the 69-year-old Bundy wore the same light-blue prison jumpsuit and faded pink undershirt that the former occupiers of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in south-eastern Oregon have worn at their hearings. He also appeared to have a fresh haircut, with his hair high and straight across the back of his head from ear to ear. Bundy\u2019s sons Ammon and Ryan are among the occupiers being held in connection to the Malheur standoff, which ended in a dramatic surrender on Thursday morning after a 41-day occupation of the federal complex in rural Harney County. Cliven Bundy was arrested at Portland international airport Wednesday night. His lawyer has said he was travelling to visit his sons in prison and family in the Boise, Idaho area, though early reports had it that he was on his way to the refuge in support of the occupiers. Bundy\u2019s new attorney, Noel Grefenson \u2013 who said he had received the government\u2019s memorandum on the bail hearing five minutes before leaving his Salem, Oregon, office Tuesday morning and had yet to read it \u2013 claimed the case against his client was thin concerning Bundy\u2019s exact role in the standoff. Bundy is accused of recruiting hundreds of supporters to his ranch in 2014, where the US bureau of land management was making arrangements for his cattle to be impounded due to unpaid grazing fees and fines dating back to 1998. The situation drew national attention and escalated into a \u201ca massive armed assault against federal law enforcement officers\u201d on 12 April 2014, according to the complaint filed against Bundy. On Tuesday, Nevada federal prosecutor Steven Myhre said there were more than 60 guns \u201craised, brandished, pointed at the officers\u201d during the standoff. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find words to represent the level of violence,\u201d Myhre told the court. \u201cAlmost to a person, those officers thought they were going to die that day.\u201d In support of the government\u2019s case that Bundy should not be released on bail ahead of his trial, Myhre argued that Bundy\u2019s \u201cactions and deeds show his violent nature\u201d and that many of the people who came to the standoff at the ranch two years ago were still at large and still \u201cpledged\u201d to support the rancher. Bundy\u2019s next court date is Friday in Las Vegas, where a preliminary hearing will take place on the six federal charges against him. He stands accused of conspiracy to commit an offense against the US; assault on a federal officer with a deadly weapon; use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence; interference with commerce by extortion; obstruction of the administration of justice; and aiding and abetting. Bundy\u2019s attorney said on Tuesday that Bundy and Nevada state representative Michele Fiore, who was instrumental as an intermediary between the FBI and the remaining occupiers last week, were supposed to fly together to Oregon, but that Bundy missed that earlier flight. He said Fiore was then supposed to pick up Bundy at the airport, but she headed to the refuge once she received word the situation was escalating. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know the FBI, as it enlisted her services [as a go-between], was intending to arrest her friend,\u201d Grefenson told the court. Stewart said: \u201cI fail to see how this is relevant.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
