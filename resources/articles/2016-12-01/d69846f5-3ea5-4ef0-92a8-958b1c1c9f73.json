Negotiations with the Portuguese champions over the Sweden international Lindelof have been continuing for several weeks and reports in Portugal said a deal worth more than \u00a330m was close to being agreed. United were keen to purchase the 22-year-old to add depth to Mourinho\u2019s squad although they were reluctant to meet his \u20ac45m (\u00a338m) release clause. But Mourinho\u2019s side have now won five games in a row \u2013 while conceding only two goals \u2013 and the Portuguese has decided to stick with the central defenders he already has at his disposal. Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo have struck up a solid partnership in central defence and Mourinho can also count on Bailly, Chris Smalling and Daley Blind in that position when they are fit. Smalling is currently out injured while Bailly has just returned to training from the knock picked up at Crystal Palace on 14 December. Bailly was on Wednesday included in the Ivory Coast squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon, which starts on 14 January. Mourinho recently hailed the form of Jones, who has now played 10 consecutive games for United without getting injured, his second-longest stretch since joining the club in 2011. \u201cSometimes defenders now think the most important ability is to build from the back,\u201d the Portuguese manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s not. The most important thing is to defend and that\u2019s what I like about Phil Jones. He likes to defend, he wants to play as a defender.\u201d Mourinho went on to say Jones could be ready to make a return to the England set-up in the near future. \u201cI prefer to say that Jones is doing much better this season than in the previous two seasons and he\u2019s giving hope to everyone that he can be back to normality and, who knows, be back to the national team, be a firm choice at Manchester United, because he\u2019s doing very well.\u201d Mourinho added the media should give his two current centre-backs more credit for what they have done in the past few weeks. He said: \u201cI think, you are the ones who admit they [Jones and Rojo] deserve more attention and more headlines. [But] they are not worried, they are playing more than ever, better than ever. \u201cRojo was also having lots of injuries. He is also [injury] free. In a period without Bailly and Smalling, where people could be scared, they stepped up. Really solid. I am happy for them.\u201d United, who are sixth in the Premier League, play Middlesbrough at home on New Year\u2019s Eve and then travel to West Ham United on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
