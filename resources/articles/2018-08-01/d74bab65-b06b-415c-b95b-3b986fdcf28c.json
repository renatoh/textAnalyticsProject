Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A on Monday, Marsden was forced to defend his best-selling Tomorrow series, which tells the story of a group of teenagers who band together to resist the invasion by an apparently Asian foreign power. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t write that book now, not because of a societal view ... but because of my own horror at the way refugees who have come to Australia have been treated,\u201d Marsden said. \u201cAnd when I hear the political debate raging today and this [is] just relegated to a footnote in the pages of hansard ... that would put me in a different position when it came to writing about threats to Australia. Because demonising people like that is unforgivable.\u201d The comments came during a special Melbourne writers festival episode of the ABC program that also featured authors Maxine Beneba Clarke, Sofie Laguna, Michael Mohammed Ahmad and Trent Dalton. The panel was dominated by a discussion of race issues following Katter Australia party senator Fraser Anning\u2019s incendiary \u201cfinal solution\u201d speech last week. Ahmad, who is Lebanese-Australian and grew up in western Sydney, was highly critical of Marsden\u2019s books, saying they had been published amid \u201ctremendous xenophobia\u201d towards the Vietnamese-Australian community and had \u201cgenuinely impacted and damaged the lives of a lot of people\u201d. \u201cAnd when I pulled the words apart in the Tomorrow series, I did interpret a paranoid white nationalist fantasy about a group of coloured people illegally invading this country,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cAnd I always find that narrative deeply ironic because that\u2019s what the white population did to the Indigenous population.\u201d Marsden replied that he was \u201chappy for anyone to react to my work in whatever ways they react\u201d. Dalton, a features writer for the Australian newspaper who has recently released his debut novel, Boy Swallows Universe, was critical of the decision by the Brisbane writers festival to drop Germaine Greer and Bob Carr from its lineup. \u201cAre we getting so soft that we can\u2019t ... handle these deep discussions?\u201d Dalton said. Greer, who has been criticised in recent years for her views on transgender people, among other things, sparked outrage with her latest book, On Rape, while Carr\u2019s memoir, Run For Your Life, includes his views on issues such as immigration and Israel. Greer was unavailable to appear at the upcoming Melbourne writers festival, but its director, Marieke Hardy, has said the prominent feminist was unlikely to have been invited anyway. Clarke told the Q&amp;A audience that Greer\u2019s current views were \u201cnot really radical\u201d. \u201cThese are kind of really harmful, mainstream ideas that are out there, that are transphobic or rape [apologetic] or whatever,\u201d she said. Decisions not to invite people \u201chappen all the time\u201d, she said, \u201cbut these are particular people that are used to being handed any platform, hence the fury\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
