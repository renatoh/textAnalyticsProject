He\u2019ll be off to get some post-reaction right now, so remember to tune in later for a more considered and thorough take, with added quotes from the men involved. Jordan and Virgil speak: Interviewed on BT Sport by Matt Smith, Jordan Henderson and Virgil Van Dijk seem reasonably content and say they\u2019re happy with the lead they\u2019re taking to Portugal for to second leg, not least because they have kept a clean sheet. Asked about Moussa Marega being a handful, Virgil Van Dijk says that Porto striker is \u201cvery strong\u201d and adds that \u201cmost of the strikers I face these days are pretty good\u201d. I may be readingtoo much into it, but he says it with a gleam in his eye that suggests he thinks he has the measure of any of them. Meanwhile at White Hart Lane: Tottenham Hotspur have beaten Manchester City by the only goal of the game in the first leg of their quarter-final. In less good news for Spurs, Harry Kane went off injured with an ankle injury that, on first impressions, seems to be quite serious. The Spurs medical team will find out more tomorrow. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! First half goals from Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino give Liverpool a two-goal cushion to take to northern Portugal for the second leg. The clean sheet they kept will be equally satisfying and while they could and probably should have scored more, this result should be enough to see them through to the next round, particularly if they can bag a goal in the second leg. Porto probably would have settled for this outcome before the game, but will be disappointed not to have scored away from home because they had their chances. 90+2 min: On the touchline, Xherdan Shaqiri is ready to come on for Liverpool. There\u2019s a fellow we haven\u2019t seen much of since Christmas and nobody seems quite sure why. Will he actually get on tonight? No, he will not. It\u2019s full-time and Liverpool have won the first leg of this quarter-final 2-0. 90 min: Into the final minute of normal time we go, with Liverpool holding on to their two-goal lead. A potential chance to increase it goes to waste when Mo Salah gives away possession in the Porto penalty area, allowing Porto to advance up the field in search of a precious away goal. They deon\u2019t find one, with some stout defending from Dejan Lovren putting a stop to Fernando\u2019s gallop. 89 min: Telles and Brahimi combine well down the left flank, but Jordan Henderson is on hand to mop up at the back when it looks like the substitute might fashion a shooting opportunity. 86 min: Moments before the Salah incident, Porto central defender Felipe felt hard done by for not getting a penalty at the other end of the pitch, feeling he\u2019d been fouled by Trent Alexander-Arnold as a cross came into the box. I\u2019m not sure if it was referred to VAR, but replays suggest it would have been a very soft decision to award a spot-kick. 84 min: There\u2019s a VAR review for a high tackle by Mo Salah on Danilo at the edge of the Porto penalty area. The Egyptian avoids a booking or red card. He went in over the top of the ball with his studs showing and caught the Porto captain high on the shin - that should be a straight red card but he somehow avoids any punishment at all. 83 min: Virgil Van Dijk puts the ball out for a corner under pressure from Moussa Marega. Liverpool clear their lines. 79 min: I\u2019m not sure if it was intended to be a shot or a cross, but this time Marega does square the ball across the face of the Liverpool goal, but there\u2019s nobody up in support to convert. Liverpool substitution: Daniel Sturridge, who I keep forgetting still plays for them, on, Bobby Firmino off. 78 min: Marega shoots high and wide over the Liverpool goal after failing to spot an excellent gallop to the far post from Otavia. He should have looked up and squared the ball, but he simply didn\u2019t see his team-mate\u2019s run. 77 min: Porto substitution: Fernando on for right-back Maxi Pereira. 74 min: Divock Origi makes an immediate impression, picking up the ball and charging towards the Porto penalty area. He\u2019s hacked to the ground just outside it by Jesus Corona, earning his side a free-kick in a promising position, on the left corner of the area. The set-piece goes to waste, however, as Mo Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold hatch some training ground plan that was probably more fiendish in their imagination than it was in practice. Over the bar from the young full-back. 70 min: Porto are defending a lot deeper than they had been previously and making little or no effort to get men forward. They\u2019re clearly happy to settle for a 2-0 defeat but will be hopeful of nicking an away goal on the break or from a set-piece. That would certainly make Liverpool\u2019s task in the second leg a little more difficult. Liverpool substitution: Sadio Mane off, Divock Origi on. Porto substitution: Oliver Torres off, Bruno Costa on. 67 min: With everyone in the stadium completely oblivious, there\u2019s a VAR check for a possible handball at a corner from Dejan Lovren. The penalty nobody appealed for, for the \u201cfoul\u201d that wasn\u2019t committed, is not given. This is ridiculous use of VAR, which again, offside aside, is only supposed to be used in the case of \u201cclear and obvious errors\u201d. The crowd had no idea what was going on there. 64 min: The intensity from both sides has dropped noticeably, with Liverpool\u2019s players perhaps conserving their energy for their weekend appointment with Chelsea. Porto have about them the air of a side that have decided a 2-0 defeat away from home might not be the worst result in the world and that they\u2019ll happily take it home and attempt to overturn it in the second leg. 62 min: Porto substitution: Francisco Soares off, Yacine Brahimi on. The Algerian international is a decent left-winger and could cause Liverpool some problems. 60 min: Alexander-Arnold gallops into the Porto penalty area,, scoops the ball wide to Salah and runs on in anticipation of the return pass. It comes from the head of Salah, but running out of room in which to manouvre, young Trent eschews the option of volleying towards goal and has to settle for a corner instead. Before it\u2019s taken, Porto central defender Felipe is booked for some indiscretion or other. 58 min: Liverpool enjoy a spell of dominance, controlling possession as they press and probe for an opening on the edge of the final third. Salah and Firmino try to play a one-two in a tight space on the edge of the box, but Danilo steps in to win possession and ease the pressure on his side. 55 min: Liverpool win a throw-in deep in Liverpool territory after a mini mix-up between Lovren and Alisson. The centre-half puts the ball out of play and then turns to his goalkeeper, making a talk-to-me gesture by flapping his fingers alongside his yap. The throw-in is taken and Liverpool clear. They\u2019re winning fairly comfortably, but showing a few minor signs of sloppiness. 53 min: Good defending from Danilo, who does well to get back and muscle Mo Salah off the ball before the Liverpool man can unleash a shot from a good position. 51 min: Crossed wires between Virgil Van Dijk and Alisson almost lead to Moussa Marega being gifted a scoring opportunity after Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper is a little too quick off his line. Van Dijk takes responsibility for hacking the ball clear, dodging a potentially embarrassing bullet but failing to avoid a minor collision with his panic-stricken goalkeeper. 49 min: Porto got away with one there- it was a very, very tight offside. Porto right-back Maxi Pereira will be mightily relieved, as it was him giving away the ball a few metres in front of his own penalty area that set up the move that led to Mane getting the ball in the net. 48 min: DISALLOWED GOAL! Sadio Mane volleys home a diagonal cross from Jordan Henderson from the edge of the six-yard box, but his effort is ruled out for offside. Our Spanish referee, Senor Lahoz, consults VAR and the decision stands. 46 min: Porto enjoy an early spell of possession which comes to an end when a wayward pass is intercepted by Fabinho, who sends Liverpool upfield on the counter-attack. 46 min: Liverpool are kept waiting as Porto are late back out on to the pitch after getting their half-time address from Sergio Conceicao. Therer are no changes in personnel on either side as Liverpool kick off. Liverpool go in for the break with a two-goal lead. Naby Keita will be credited with their opener, despite his shot from the edge of the penalty area being steered past Iker Casillas by the outstretched leg and foot of Oliver Torres. Roberto Firmino doubled Liverpool\u2019s lead, slotting home from a couple of yards out after excellent build-up play from Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. 45 min: Porto win a throw-in halfway inside their own half as an entertaining first half draws to a close. They\u2019re two goals down, but their cause is far from lost - they\u2019re creating chances and might have scored a goal or two if Moussa Marega had showed a little more composure in front of goal. 44 min: Danilo goes down holding his shin following a crunching tackle from Fabinho. The Liverpool midfielder is penalised, despite replays showing his challenge was textbook. 40 min: While I was pontificating on the misuse of VAR, Dejan Lovren was called upon to sprint back and dispossess Moussa Marega as he threatened Liverpool\u2019s goal again. Good defending from the Croatian, against a striker who\u2019s proving a real handful. 36 min: Going back to that VAR decision, I personally was a little bit surprised that Porto didn\u2019t get a penalty. As he attempted to clear the ball, Alisson steered it on to the outstretched arm of Alexander-Arnold. I wouldn\u2019t say it was a deliberate hand-ball by the right-back, but his arm was outstretched and could therefore be interpreted as being in an \u201cunnatural position\u201d. The handball law needs to be amended, to be honest. Also, VAR is only supposed to be used in the event of \u201cclear and obvious errors\u201d, which wasn\u2019t the case there. The referee simply buckled in the face of the pressure put on him by the Porto players who surrounded him after the ball struck Alexander-Arnold\u2019s arm. 33 min: Roberto Firmino attempts to place a half-volley in the top corner as he gets on the end of Jordan Henderson cross from the right. It\u2019s not a bad effort from distance, but the ball goes high and wide. 30 min: A corner they almost score from! The ball is arced into the penalty area and only half-cleared to the edge of the area. It\u2019s headed back towards goal by Danilo and somewhere near the penalty spot, Marega swivels and sends a volley straight at Alisson. \u201cIf anything he\u2019s hit it too well, Clive!\u201d as Andy Townsend might say - if he\u2019d placed it anywhere else on target he was guaranteed a goal. 29 min: Save!!! Alisson does well to save from Moussa Marega after the Porto striker was through on goal with only the Brazilian to beat. In the subsequent clamour to clear the ball, Alisson punches it out for a corner off Trent Alexander-Arnold. There\u2019s a hint of handball and the ref consults his Video Assistant Referee. No penalty, Porto have to settle for a corner. 27 min: Porto were well and truly carved open there. Hats off to Jordan Henderson, who picked out Trent Alexander-Arnold with a wonderful delivery. The Liverpool right-back did well to keep himself onside, before looking up, spotting Firmino unmarked on the edge of the six yard box and squaring the ball. Liverpool double their lead! Roberto Firmino scores with a tap-in from three of four yards out, slotting home a low Trent Alexander-Arnold cross from the right. 21 min: Quick as a flash, Mo Salah latches on to a shockingly loose pass back towards his own penalty area by one of Porto\u2019s midfielders and is clean through on goal. As he bore down on the Porto penalty area, Felipe lungged in and but unable to put him off. With Iker Casillas advancing, Salah rolled the ball towards the far corner, only for his aim to let him down. The ball trundles a couple of feet the wrong side of the far upright. 20 min: Francisco Soares was booked in the aftermath of Porto\u2019s most recent scoring opportunity, for what I can only presume was dissent. I suspect he may have paid for the sins of his team-mate Otavio. 18 min: A low Salah volley from outside the penalty area needs a little bit of saving and Iker Casillas does exactly that, the bounce of the ball on its way towards him making his effort less than routine. Moments previously, Francisco Soares had got in behind Trent Alexander-Arnold to tee up Moussa Marega. Virgil Van Dijk was on hand to prevent the striker from getting a shot away. FYI: Only Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski have scored more than the Porto striker in this season\u2019s Champions League. 16 min: Liverpool win a corner after a rampaging Mo Salah run into the penalty area is abruptly ended by the intervention of Eder Militao. Nothing comes from the ensuing set piece, although Porto do embark on a counter-attack. Who pops up in the Liverpool left-back position to put a stop to their gallop? Mo Salah, that\u2019s who. 13 min: Porto forward Otavio is correctly penalised for handball and gives Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz an earful for what he feels is a harsh decision. It isn\u2019t and he must know it, but he complains anyway. In return, he gets a ferocious telling-off from the official, but even then continues to complain. Somewhat surprisingly, Senor Lahoz keeps his yellow card in his pocket. 10 min: Liverpool advance with Trent Alexander-Arnold on the ball. He moves it on to Henderson, who tries to play Mo Salah in behind down the right flank. The ball goes out of play off Porto centre-half Eder Millitao and Salah appeals for the corner. The referee ignores him and awards a goal-kick. 7 min: Well, well ... what a start. There was an element of good fortune about Liverpool\u2019s opener, in so far as Oliver Torrres dived in to attempt to block Naby Keita\u2019s shot from the edge of therpenalty area, but succeeded only in diverting the course of the effort and sending the ball into the top corner past the hopelessly wrong-footed Casillas. The attack was begun by James Milner, who played the ball wide to Sadio Mane. He advanced down the left, before playing it to Keita on the edge of the penalty area and the rest, as they say, is history. 6 min: Another chance for Liverpool, as Bobby Firmino is played in behind the Porto defence, but fails in his effort to lift the ball over the advancing Iker Casillas. Liverpool take the lead courtesy of a Naby Keita shot that takes a wicked deflection off Oliver Torres and sails into the top right-hand corner. 4 min: Danilo puts the ball out of play near the halfway line following a robust challenge on James Milner that Liverpool\u2019s stand-in left-back doesn\u2019t appreciate. 2 min: A poor clearance from Alisson gives Porto a throw-in deep in Liverpool territory. The ball\u2019s crossed in from the right and in the Liverpool penalty area, Moussa Marega gives Dejan Lovren the slip and unleashes a shot. He fails to connect properly and his effort sails well wide. A lively start from the Portuguese side, here. 1 min: An early cross into the Liverpool penalty area from Alex Telles on the left flank, but there\u2019s nobody there in a Porto shirt to get on the end of it. James Milner clears. 1 min: Porto get the ball rolling, their players wearing blue and white striped shirts, blue shorts and white socks. Liverpool\u2019s players, as you might expect, wear their customary red shirts, red shorts and red socks. There\u2019s quite a racket. It\u2019s difficult to hear the Champions League anthem over the raucous chanting of Liverpool\u2019s fans as the two teams go through the last of the pre-match formalities. Kick-off is just a couple of minutes away. Not long now: Liverpool\u2019s supporters go through their pre-match rendition of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone as they wait for the teams to emerge from the tunnel and go through the last of the pre-match niceties. Beneath the stand, Liverpool are first out of their dressing-room and Jordan Henderson has his game face win as he prepares to lead out the troops. Porto are soon out to join them and the teams make their way out on to the pitch. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Milner, Henderson, Fabinho, Keita, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Mignolet, Wijnaldum, Gomez, Sturridge, Shaqiri, Origi, Matip. FC Porto: Casillas, Maxi Pereira, Felipe, Eder Militao, Alex Telles, Corona, Danilo Pereira, Torres, Otavio, Marega, Tiquinho Soares. Subs: Vana, Diogo Leite, Costa, Hernani, Brahimi, Andre Pereira, Fernando. Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Spain) Alex Telles starts at left-back, having recovered from injury. As expected, Eder Militao has moved inside to the centre of defence to cover for the suspended Pepe, allowing Maxi Pereira to step in at right-back. Oliver Torres comes into midfield in place of the suspended Hector Herrera. Jurgen Klopp makes three changes to the Liverpool team that beat Southampton on Friday. As expected, James Milner replaces the suspended Andy Robertson at left-back, while Jordan Henderson is in for Gini Wijnaldum, who picked up an injury on Liverpool\u2019s visit to the south coast. Dejan Lovren replaces Joel Matip in central defence, making his first start since Wolves eliminated Liverpool from the FA Cup in the first week of January. We\u2019ll have both line-ups and the subs for you very shortly. Some pre-match listening: Max Rushden was hurling the interrogatory projectiles as myself, Jonathan Wilson and the Racing Post\u2019s Mark Langdon reviewed the weekend\u2019s football action and looked forward to the midweek Champions League action, on the current issue of the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast. If you\u2019re not already a subscriber, where have you been for the past 12 years? You can sign up in all of the usual pod places. Jurgen Klopp speaks: \u201cEverybody wanted Porto, until you have Porto,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s manager. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want Porto, to be honest. They only look at numbers, names and stuff like that. People with a proper idea about football didn\u2019t want to have Porto. That\u2019s the truth. But we have it. But nobody wanted Liverpool, by the way. It will be a tough one but we are really looking forward to it.\u201d Sergio Conceicao speaks: \u201cWe look at Liverpool as a very strong team, who in this stadium in 16 games only drew two,\u201d said Porto\u2019s manager in his press conference yesterday. \u201cWe know all about their power. Liverpool is on a very high level. Every week they have a very high level of competition. With us it\u2019s not like that, no disrespect to the other teams. Realising the power of the opponent, our absences and that we are in the first game of the quarter-finals, we have to be smart and creative in the strategy for the game.\u201d Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson misses out through suspension after picking up a daft booking - his third yellow card of the tournament - against Bayern Munich in the last round. He is likely to be replaced by James Milner, with Fabinho making up a midfield trio alongside Jordan Henderson and Gini Wijnaldum. Porto, will have to make do without their Mexican midfielder H\u00e9ctor Herrera, while Pepe is also confined to the naughty step on the back of the totting-up procedure. Interestingly \u2013 or not, depending on your point of view - two of the three yellow cards picked up by Pepe were brandished in the Europa League, in which he represented Besiktas before re-signing for Porto in January. He is likely to be replaced in the heart of their defence by right-back Eder Militao moving inside, while one of Jesus Corona or Maxi Pereira is likely to start in his place on the right. Danilo, Otavio and Militao are all one booking away from being suspended for the second leg. Porto\u2019s speedy Brazilian left-back Alex Telles is a major injury concern for Porto and would be a massive loss if he doesn\u2019t recover from a hip injury, having contributed five goals and 10 assists to the cause already this season. He is understood to be on Tottenham\u2019s summer shopping list and if fit enough to play, is likely to have his mettle rigorously tested tonight. Anfield is the scene for the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final between Liverpool and Porto, a match that has been somewhat overshadowed by an all English affair due to take place simultaneously 209 miles away at a certain spanking new stadium on London\u2019s White Hart Lane. While Liverpool got the draw pretty much everyone wanted, they should underestimate Porto, a side against whom they they have never lost a European game, at their peril. Second in the Portuguese league table behind Benfica, but only on goal difference, S\u00e9rgio Conceicao\u2019s side emerged from Group D ahead of Schalke, Galatasaray and Lokomotiv Moscow, before eliminating Roma in the first knockout round. They face their sternest test yet tonight at Anfield, a ground where they held the hosts scoreless in last season\u2019s round of 16, before getting thumped 5-0 by Liverpool in their own Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. Kick-off tonight is at 8pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
