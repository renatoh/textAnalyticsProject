Pearl yesterday sweetened its offer to 691p a share - up from 660p - but that was rejected by Resolution because it \"significantly undervalues\" the business. Resolution shares closed up 15p to 722p. Pearl, which is Resolution's biggest shareholder, believes the Friends merger is not good value and has tried to block the move. But Standard Life has also been eyeing Resolution and the Takeover Panel has set a deadline of Thursday for bids. Antoinette Odoi UK grows at fastest annual rate since 2004 The UK economy grew faster than expected in the past three months and at its fastest annual rate in more than three years, the Office for National Statistics reported yesterday. The economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter above estimates for a slowdown to 0.7% from the 0.8% in the second quarter. This took the annual rate to 3.3% from 3.1% in the second quarter, the strongest rate since the second quarter of 2004. Analysts said the strength of retail, hotels, transport and communications sectors reinforced expectations that interest rates would not be cut soon.
