If you are feeling a bit nervous then wearing a wetsuit makes you a lot more buoyant, or do what we did and just wear a lifejacket! You may feel slightly ridiculous, but it's soon forgotten after a few minutes effortlessly bobbing around. I would also definitely recommend scuba diving. I first tried it in Cairns a couple of years ago, having previously been completely adamant that I would never ever try it (I'm not much of a swimmer!). Although scared stiff, I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and I was hooked. Last year I was finally brave enough to do my PADI course in Thailand, and am now totally addicted. The best thing to do would be an introductory dive where the instructor does all the work for you. I actually find diving easier than snorkelling now, and once you've got over the initial shock, the feeling of being in the 'underwater world' is just amazing. Whatever you decide to do, you'll enjoy it!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
