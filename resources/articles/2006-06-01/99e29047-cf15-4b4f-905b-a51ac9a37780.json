Its nasty little ratty tail was spotted disappearing below the peelings one morning. This is a common problem, and I did everything to prevent it happening - no meat scraps or eggshells, nothing cooked - so I just never thought it would happen to me. The shame. I tackled the problem by kicking the bin over and running away, like a little girl. I thought the rain and damp in the abandoned heap would see the rat off, but for weeks, telltale burrows suggested it continued to visit for mouldy morsels. A long-term solution was offered by a wormery from Original Organics (01884 841515, originalorganics.co.uk). The tiger worms that came with it through the post have taken a few weeks of pampering and nurturing to get over the shock, but are now settled in and ravenous, eating all the kitchen scraps I can throw at them (except citrus skins). My Original Wormery is designed to cope with the output of a family of four, but there's also a neat little Junior Wormery - just the thing for composting singletons. Both seal shut, so rats can't get in, and worms and whiffs can't get out, so you could keep yours indoors if you have no outdoor space (and if you trust that seal). I will get a strong liquid plant feed from it every eight weeks and a nutrient-rich compost in a year's time. The compost proper is now back in action, but only dealing with prunings and grass cuttings - all kitchen scraps go to the worms - leaving the rat to slink off to pastures not so green."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
