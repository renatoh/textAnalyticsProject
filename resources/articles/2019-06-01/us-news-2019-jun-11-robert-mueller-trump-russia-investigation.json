The former special counsel was fast, precise, ran a tight ship and, working in a hyper-partisan environment under the full glare of history, Mueller managed to investigate and document a historic attack on the United States while retaining the public trust. But one week after Mueller first spoke out about his investigation of Russian election tampering and the Donald Trump campaign, concern has sharpened that in one big way \u2013 potentially the biggest way \u2013 Mueller was exactly the wrong man for the job. For when the pursuit of justice took Mueller into unprecedented terrain \u2013 as the special counsel\u2019s investigation came under sustained public attack by the president and the attorney general, William Barr \u2013 Mueller failed, his critics say, both to stand up for his investigation and to get the word out to the American people about what he had found. \u201cTo my mind, this is a Shakespearean-level tragedy,\u201d said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who was part of the team that convicted the Gambino family boss John Gotti. \u201cIt is the tragedy of the principled person, who is constrained by principle, being opposed by the completely unprincipled \u2013 Barr, and the president, and their lackeys. \u201cThe principled are chained, and the unprincipled romp free. And in a debate over reality, the unprincipled will always win, because they will just lie, and they will make reality whatever they want it to be.\u201d Congressional Democrats convened hearings on the Mueller report on Monday, and the judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, has said he would call Mueller to testify about the 11 instances of potentially criminal obstruction of justice committed by Donald Trump and his campaign that the Mueller report documents. But Mueller has refused, and has said he will continue to refuse, in discussions of his findings, to go beyond the language in his report, which declines to weigh evidence against the president while leaving open the possibility that crimes were committed. \u201cIf we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\u201d Mueller said at his news conference on 29 May, in a minor paraphrase of a memorably coy phrase from the document. But against the full firepower of Trump\u2019s Twitter account \u2013 \u201cNo collusion, no obstruction\u201d, it chants \u2013 and Barr\u2019s strategic misrepresentations, Mueller\u2019s indirect language fails to communicate to the American people the basic facts of the president\u2019s egregious misconduct, critics say. \u201cMueller went out like a lamb in his remarks Wednesday, when the country needed a lion,\u201d columnist David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cHe was so polite and deferential, so insistent on following Justice Department rules limiting his actions that, in practical terms, he ceded the ground to Trump and his apologists.\u201d There is no denial that Mueller, the starched former marine and FBI director, has been caught in a dilemma. To get out the truth about his report, he would need to go beyond its forensic discussion of the evidence, to characterize the thrust of that evidence. But to do that would, in Mueller\u2019s view, be unfair to Trump, who as a sitting president cannot be indicted, according to justice department guidelines, and so cannot have his proverbial day in court to answer the charges against him. It\u2019s not Mueller\u2019s job as he sees it to interpret his findings. It is his job to present them, not for the justice department to further pursue, but perhaps for Congress to take up. \u201cPeople on cable TV say Mueller needs to get out there and be an advocate,\u201d said Harry Sandick, a former assistant US attorney in the southern district of New York. \u201cBut if he did that, he wouldn\u2019t be Mueller. That\u2019s not who this person is, and the very reason why he has such credibility is because he didn\u2019t engage in that sort of ongoing commentary.\u201d But others argue that Mueller has a greater duty in this case than painstaking adherence to a playbook written for prosecutors applying the law in quotidian matters. As perhaps the only person with the authority to cut through Trump\u2019s lies about the Mueller report and to point the way toward justice, Mueller, by this view, has a national duty to call out the president\u2019s lies and to tell the country, using plain language, what he found. \u201cHe saw the problem,\u201d Cotter said, referring to the Trump administration campaign of lies about the report. \u201cHe recognized that he had to do something to try to fix it because it\u2019s really important. But he failed. He failed because he simply couldn\u2019t bring himself to go just a little bit into common language and just say the simple, plain truth.\u201d Preet Bharara, the former US attorney in the southern district of New York, thought that in his only public address in the two years of his investigation, Mueller seemed unusually drawn. \u201cIt was the same Bob Mueller,\u201d Bharara said on his podcast. \u201cHe seemed a little less strong in his manner than he usually does. He seemed a little bit more reluctant than I\u2019ve seen him before, at other events.\u201d Mueller\u2019s relatively mild presentation was a refreshing change from the typically overheated quality of the national discourse, said Sandick, who was one of more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors and justice department officials to co-sign a letter saying that the Mueller report documents conduct that would be chargeable as criminal were it committed by anyone but the president. \u201cHasn\u2019t our national debate been coarsened enough, and shouldn\u2019t we appreciate the old-school attributes of somebody like Bob Mueller, who declined to engage in hand-to-hand combat with 140 characters?\u201d asked Sandick. \u201cProsecutors aren\u2019t television hosts. They\u2019re not entertainers, and they should do their talking in the courtroom and in their court filings. It\u2019s not their job to wage the battle of public opinion. It\u2019s their job to investigate and prosecute crimes.\u201d But in fulfilling a prescribed duty, Mueller failed a higher one, said Cotter. \u201cI think what America needed at this moment was a slightly less strictly principled person,\u201d he said, \u201cwho was willing to actually take the heat for being arguably somewhat less than 100% principled in the legal construct, and just talk to people in plain, simple language.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
