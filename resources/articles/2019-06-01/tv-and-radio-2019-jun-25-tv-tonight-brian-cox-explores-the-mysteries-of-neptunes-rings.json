Here, he is tunnelling into Uranus tonight, explaining the circumstances of the outer planets\u2019 births, the mysteries of Neptune\u2019s rings and their place at the very outer edges of both our galactic neighbourhood and our comprehension. An uplifting series that is a paean to the wonders of the universe, but also a celebration of the nobler urges of humanity: our curiosity and our capacity for exploration. Phil Harrison The Thames: Britain\u2019s Great River With Tony Robinson 8pm, Channel 5 Tony Robinson reflects on his teenage years working on the docks, and accompanies the Metropolitan police marine unit on patrol in the East End \u2013 also attending an emergency call-out to an unexploded bomb. Last in the series (although that\u2019s not because of the bomb). Ali Catterall Her Majesty\u2019s Cavalry 9pm, ITV The series about the British army\u2019s Household Cavalry, narrated by Hugh Bonneville, offers light and jovial pro-royal fare \u2013 although it is never particularly gripping, nor demanding. Episode four follows Trooper Croker \u2013 the first ever female recruit to enter the regiment \u2013 as well as her colleagues, who are off training in Canada. Hannah J Davies Pride Live at the Apollo 10pm, BBC Two Winnowed from more than 14 series of standup stalwart Live at the Apollo, this is the first of two half-hours celebrating LGBT comedy at the BBC. An unmissable showcase of the funniest bits from stars who have appeared on the show, it features sets from Desiree Burch, Alan Carr, Eddie Izzard and Zoe Lyons. Mike Bradley Drag SOS 10pm, Channel 4 A liberating new makeover show in which Manchester drag queens the Family Gorgeous tour the UK helping people to \u201cfind their inner fabulous\u201d. Their first stop is Dover, where they transform \u201cthree ordinary locals\u201d for an extraordinary drag performance. Good sequinned fun, but with a serious side. MB Warrior 10pm, Sky One As you might expect from a crime drama \u201cbased on an original concept by Bruce Lee\u201d, this is a kickass martial arts extravaganza framed by the exploits of a Chinese immigrant embroiled in the Tong Wars in 1870s San Francisco. Already greenlit for a second season, creator (and real-life karate black belt) Jonathan \u201cBanshee\u201d Tropper\u2019s new gig looks to be a surefire smash hit. MB Film choice Wild (Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, 2014) 11.20pm, Film4 Reese Witherspoon makes this account of a 1,100-mile trek along the Pacific Crest trail a compelling journey. Adapted by Nick Hornby from Cheryl Strayed\u2019s memoir, it follows Witherspoon\u2019s Cheryl on a sunbaked, blistery, rain-sodden path of self-discovery. Painful memories and physical exhaustion combine to haunting effect. Paul Howlett Live sport World Cup cricket: England v Australia 9.30am, Sky Sports Cricket.
