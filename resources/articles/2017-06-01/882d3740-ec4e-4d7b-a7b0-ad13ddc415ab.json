But in fairness to the Newmarket trainer, winners have not exactly been tumbling out of his yard in recent weeks; let\u2019s hope this proves a timely fillip for him ahead of Royal Ascot. Ribchester was the only horse to beat Thikriyaat in his first five races, which also included a Group Three success at Glorious Goodwood. He had a fibrillating heart when well beaten on his final run last season and surely needed his return to action in a handicap. There is more to come from him at the age of four and this return to a sound surface will help. 1.50 York Hurdling did not work out for the ex-Italian Azari but a return to Flat racing showed him in a pretty good light in a Wolverhampton claimer the other day. Having since moved from Paul Nicholls to Tom Dascombe, he looks like he belongs at this level and has one of the better riders involved. 2.05 Musselburgh The handicapper is probably right to rate Zac Brown a better horse on sand than on turf but he still has possibilities on grass, as he showed when winning at Goodwood last time. Charlie Wallis\u2019s gelding faces a stiffer task here but could be up to beating the penalty. 2.20 York Shady McCoy is of interest, now that he\u2019s back in a big field, but a wide draw is no help. Heaven\u2019s Guest also loves a big-field handicap and has dropped to an enticing mark. His most recent effort hinted he might be on the way back and he went close from 9lb higher over this course and distance in May last year. 2.40 Sandown Tim Easterby\u2019s team seem to be running their way into form and this doesn\u2019t feel like the time to desert his Copper Knight, the winner of his last two starts. He made all to defy a mark of 95 in a York handicap last time and it seems a gelding operation has made quite a difference to this one, a flop in last year\u2019s Windsor Castle when with Hugo Palmer. 3.10 Musselburgh Another Easterby runner, Orion\u2019s Bow, might be worth a second look. The winner of five in a row for Dandy Nicholls last summer, he could be helped by this drop to five furlongs with a strong pace assured. Duke Of Firenze is respected but I don\u2019t fancy his chance of picking a way through from his draw close to the stands\u2019 rail, where runners will congregate in front of him through the early stages. 3.30 York Easterby has another fair chance with Golden Apollo, carrying a penalty for a jaw-dropping performance at Pontefract on Monday that left his previous form far behind. His trainer has won this race twice in the past four years.
