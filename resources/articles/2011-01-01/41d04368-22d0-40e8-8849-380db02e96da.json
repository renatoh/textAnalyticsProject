Morning Glory features Ford as Mike Pomeroy, a granite-haired, gravel-larynxed American news anchor who, as a result of a contractual dispute with his network, is forced to become co-host of a viewer-abandoned and critically trashed breakfast TV show at risk of being pulled from the schedules. Unfortunately the crappy format goes under the name Daybreak, for which reason Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley were happy on this occasion to cede the big film-star interview to their BBC1 rivals, and clear ratings-winners, Bill Turnbull and Sian Williams. Revealingly, both the Hollywood script about the fictional Daybreak, and newspaper coverage of the continuing problems at the factual ITV1 show of that name \u2013 which feels about as secure as a football manager after four months of defeats \u2013 work from the premise that there is something inherently comic about broadcasting at dawn. Although Morning Glory wryly takes its title from a euphemism for an erection, the implication of the film is that breakfast TV has a detumescent effect in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen or wherever else it is watched. The sardonic attitude to post-dawn broadcasting is enhanced by the fact that the network producing the celluloid Daybreak, IBS, shares initials with the distressing condition irritable bowel syndrome. The idea that the early shift is humorously unnatural is based on the disjunction between the demeanour of the presenters and that of a large part of the audience: the hosts are flashing their teeth at the viewers before most of them have even cleaned theirs, exchanging perky dialogue and quips at a time of day when it is common for civilians to be completely incapable of speech. All breakfast presenters in any part of the world become used to answering questions from viewers and interviewers about their start-up routine: the multiple alarm-clocks, protein shakes and toddler-like bed times. A recurrent visual gag in Morning Glory, as in all dramas featuring early-show hosts, is the cutaway to the bleeping clock-radio displaying, in blood-red liquid numerals, an improbably time such as 02:30. In the early days of breakfast television in America, presenters often utilised special sparkly eye drops \u2013 a practice dampened by rumours that one brand had made the test rabbits blind. The mystery of how they look like that while we're feeling like this is central to breakfast television, and to the major joke in the Ford movie: that the producers have foolishly introduced to the format an anchorman who is simply not a morning kind of guy and makes the mistake of looking and sounding as gruff and grumpy as the blokes at home. This gag will seem less fresh for British filmgoers as it seems to have been the strategy behind the recruitment of Chiles to ITV's 6am-8.30am schedule. The fictional Daybreak is also relevant to its real-life British namesake in another way. Morning Glory's script sets up a debate between hard news and soft news, which is a current argument in broadcast culture; the surviving viewers of Chiles and Bleakley on ITV1 can feel the show struggling with the question of how serious it can afford to be. In the movie the standoff is never properly resolved. But in reality the most successful morning formats \u2013 NBC's Today Show, BBC1's Breakfast \u2013 have proved able to cope with both terrorism and tourism, cooks and books. While America's early shows pioneered wacky meteorologists \u2013 one removed his toupee between bulletins to emphasise forecast wind strength \u2013 they also properly covered upsets in campaign primaries and presidential memoirs. Although the setting is American, Morning Glory has a British director, Roger Michell, which may be significant as the sparrowfart schedules can still attract a bemused curiosity in the UK. The morning audience here is, by peak-time standards, small \u2013 Breakfast News and Daybreak compete for a total pool of about 2.4 million viewers, with the former currently claiming two-thirds \u2013 and, in contrast to the US, radio remains the most popular way to wake the brain. As a result, Morning Glory may be seen by more people who don't watch breakfast telly than who do, and risks perpetuating the unfair stereotype that such shows are a bit of a joke. Chiles and Bleakley must be glad multiplex screenings take place way past their bedtimes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
