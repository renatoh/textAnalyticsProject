She was the only act I missed on the Pyramid Stage all day (slightly undermining the whole point of the activity though, I realise) after I got aurally seduced by Buddy Guy. It can happen. I was back at the Pyramid by the time Shawn Carter started flashing the words of Noel Gallagher up in front of 80,000 people though ... Jay-Z's set was a great climax to the night and one of the best Glastonbury headlining sets. Not the best, but for impact, interaction, virtuosity and sheer attention to detail, it must rank with Radiohead '97 or Pulp '95. That the other two acts fit neatly into the definition of Glastonbury music laid down by the Oasis elder, is probably not coincidental. But Jay Z disposed of the rule book tonight. The show started with a crackle and fizz as the PA system was taken over by a video montage, flashing up Noel's words alongside images of everyone from Gordon Brown to George Bush to Boris Johnson (often) and the Queen. It was speedy, unsettling and while the link between Boris and Noel wasn't made too clear, it was apparent Noel wasn't coming out of it well. And it got worse when the star of the night strutted on stage shortly afterwards and mimed along to Wonderwall with a big grin on his face. From there it was straight into 99 Problems, then the rest of his bangers (Big Pimpin', check, Encore, check, Girls Girls Girls, check) and half of the biggest international hits of the past two years (Umbrella, A Milli, Rehab) seeing as he's done a guest verse or two on the remixes. There was loads of acapella even a special verse in English slang, rhyming about the tabloids and the telly and the \"crown jewels\" (pun intended). He left with a short oration on the importance of love and broadmindedness and, if truth be told, I had a little Glastonbury moment. It was worth any amount of MOR."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
