Born in 1934, Adcock spend much of her childhood, including the war years, in England, and has lived here permanently since 1963. Her Poems 1960-2000 received widespread critical acclaim and she has also published translations of Romanian and medieval Latin poetry. She was awarded the OBE in 1996, and the Queen will present her poetry medal in a ceremony on June 7. The gold medal for poetry was first awarded by King George V in 1933 at the suggestion of the then poet laureate, John Masefield. Recommendations for the award are made by a committee chaired by the current poet laureate, Andrew Motion. The Marchioness of Bath has received an unusual gift at Longleat - a mechanical cylinder desk inspired by Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus. It was designed by the British designers and craftsmen Senior &amp; Carmichael, which comprises Rupert Senior and Charles Wheeler-Carmichael. Lady Bath asked that the desk be \"feminine and romantic\", so the craftsmen designed the desk's canopy in a pale ripple sycamore, to resemble the scallop shell of the Botticelli painting. The blue of the writing surface is intended to recall the foaming sea, and the desk itself is made from an English yew tree from a parkland originally planted by the landscaper Humphry Repton. In 2003 Senior &amp; Carmichael completed a mechanical desk for the Marquess of Bath, to add to the furniture collection at Longleat House. Terry Pawson Architects have won an international competition to design a new opera house and music theatre in Linz, Austria. Valued at \u20ac143m (around \u00a3100m) the Linzer Musiktheater will have a 900-seat theatre auditorium, front of house facilities, a box office, cafes, bar and a restaurant and workshop spaces. It will also house new offices for the Bruckner Orchestra, led by American conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who will relocate from a nearby venue on the Danube. Journalist Ruth Gledhill will host a debate over the veracity of Dan Brown's blockbuster The Da Vinci Code at this year's National Christian Resources Exhibition at Sandown Park, Esher, from May 9-12. Author Lynn Picknett, who is also a lecturer on heresy and the occult, will argue in favour of the contentions made in The Da Vinci Code, chiefly that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers. jacqueline.maley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
