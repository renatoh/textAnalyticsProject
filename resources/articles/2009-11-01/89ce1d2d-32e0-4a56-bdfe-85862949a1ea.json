Once it had sunk in that they had built the wall, and it would stay, we sat with friends at night working out what to do. Some Italian friends \u2013 who could move between East and West Berlin \u2013 came up with the idea of a tunnel. I was kept informed of every aspect of the digging. It was hair-raising: lots of other tunnels collapsed and people were killed, but the idea of staying locked in a country was infinitely worse than the dangers involved in trying to escape. Once it had been dug over four months, we went to the entry point in a cellar. I was in a suit, which was wrecked by walking 135 metres through mud. We made it \u2013 I momentarily fainted \u2013 and I then tried to build my life again. I later fell in love with a tunneller, my husband Joachim. Every anniversary brings back the horrors of our flight but, more powerfully, the relief that we didn't spend nearly 30 years trapped in our own country. Dissident leader: 'We were not free enough thinkers to use the opportunity' B\u00e4rbel Bohley, a dissident leader in 1989 and co-founder of the Neues Forum movement, which helped to topple the regime We dissidents were rather stupid after the fall of the wall \u2013 we should have gone straight to Bonn [then the capital of West Germany] and insisted on participating in the unification agreement. We didn't do that: we had blinkers on and, despite our opposition role during the GDR, were not free enough thinkers to use the opportunities the fall of the wall gave us. So the new Germany was moulded in West Germany's image and if you criticised that you were seen as an opponent of reunification, which just wasn't fashionable in 1990. I don't miss the GDR as such, but I do miss the fact that the Berlin district I live in \u2013 Prenzlauer Berg \u2013 is now bereft of all its old residents, and has turned from being a workers' quarter where there was a strong sense of camaraderie into a stronghold for chic yuppies from West Germany. It has become a somewhat boring district with bronze doorbells and people who call the police when someone has a party. I also resent the fact that so many members of the Stasi have made careers for themselves across the political spectrum. It's typisch Deutsch \u2013 typical German \u2013 that people forget history fast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
