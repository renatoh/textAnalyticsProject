(\"A sound like Uncle Tom Cobleigh reading Neville Cardus to faraway natives\", as the poet Dylan Thomas nicely put it). Arlott's last cricket commentary was from Lord's in the late summer of 1980, so anyone who remembers hearing it is probably now approaching his or her forties. That centenary Ashes Test match of 31 years ago also marked, of course, his final summer as the Guardian's cricket correspondent. He was never to watch another single passage of proper cricket, except the day at Old Trafford when he was persuaded against his better sentimental judgment to open the new press box named after Sir Neville, his predecessor on the paper. So lucky, lucky me and my generation. I can even name the very day Arlott's confiding soupy\u2011thick Hampshire vowels first stirred, delighted and then permanently engaged the consciousness of this eight-year-old. It was 1947, the South Africans were touring; I was just home for the school holidays and after lunch on 26 July (Wisden remains invaluable for spot-on logging of one's whole life), relayed live from Headingley came a distinctive voice out of the old bakelite wireless set in the corner of our West Country kitchen. It was describing Nottinghamshire's pace bowler Harold Butler turning at his mark: \"So the burly Butler again bends into his bustling sag-kneed run-up \u2026 he quickens to the crease \u2026 over she goes \u2026 and \u2026 he's bowled him!\" Mitchell bowled Butler 51. I was hook-line-and-sinkered and was to remain so for the next 33 summers as the irreplaceable voice, slightly sharper then and more tangy, had ripened into a burr which was leisurely and mellow, and very much a recognisable national institution. And so the enchantment continued all the way to that sign\u2011off at Lord's in 1980: \"\u2026 and Boycott pushes this away between silly\u2011point and slip \u2026 picked up by Mallett at short third man \u2026 the end of the over \u2026 it's 69 for two, nine runs off the over, 28 Boycott, 15 Gower, 69 for two, and after Trevor Bailey it'll be Christopher Martin\u2011Jenkins.\" Just like that. No frills, no fuss. He stood up, downed his glass of claret at a gulp, mopped his brow with a great red-spotted hankie and exited, swift and silent. Outside, TMS colleague Tony Lewis affectionately chided: \"Not a very romantic last word, John\", to which the poet in Arlott replied: \"There's nothing remotely more romantic than a complete-and-forever clean break.\" There had been umpteen terrific poems \u2013 evocative, telling, melancholy \u2013 and shelf-fulls of books \u2013 more than 100 \u2013 not only on cricket, but as an expert on football and games generally; on wines, of course; on English cheeses; on snuff even; on parish churches; on English counties; on collecting first editions, and Victorian aquatints. Arlott's memory was lauded only last month on the death at 80 of Basil D'Oliveira, for John was responsible for Dolly's initial \"escape\" from South Africa's wretched racial bondage in the 1960s. In 1968 when the Pretoria government refused Basil entry with the England team, Arlott spoke at the Cambridge Union against the motion \"That politics should not intrude on sporting contacts\". Seconding the minister of sport Denis Howell, Arlott's was a mesmerising denunciation of the motion (overturned dramatically by 334 votes to 160) which had been proposed by Ted Dexter and Wilf Wooller. \"It is political commitment and political belief that can make a man think that his opponent's views are so obnoxious that he will abstain from playing any game with him as a protest against what the other man believes,\" he said. \"Any man's political commitment, if it is deep enough, is his very personal philosophy and it governs his whole way of life, it governs his belief, and it certainly governs the people with whom he is prepared to mix.\" Arlott died just before dawn on 14 December 1991. On the gravestone at Alderney's St Ann's churchyard is carved a line from one of his own poems: \"So clear you see these timeless things that, like a bird, the vision sings.\" There, a week after the funeral, on Christmas Day morning Ian Botham, who had a cottage on the island, cracked open a bottle of John's favourite Beaujolais at the graveside and \u2013 one true great all-rounder to another \u2013 raised a fond toast to his memory \u2026 from all cricket and beyond."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
