Neale Whitaker Television personality and editor Neale Whitaker brings a wealth of knowledge and style to the worlds of interior design and publishing. I\u2019ve never had any interest in gender stereotypes. Being a man in today\u2019s world means being a compassionate, respectful and kind human first, a loving partner second and a gay man third. I was born in the 60s and grew up in the 70s, when gender was pretty much expected to define your life. As a man, you were supposed to behave in a certain way. Boys lived in a blue world, girls in a pink one. Broadly speaking, masculinity is far more fluid now than it was in my youth. It\u2019s no longer a one-size-fits-all term. My definition of success has remained fairly constant \u2026 although I believe I was more ambitious when I was younger. Satisfaction and creativity have always ranked high. I\u2019d be lying if I said money wasn\u2019t important but it\u2019s never been the driver. Does age and experience bring empowerment? If so, then I guess I\u2019m empowered now. I feel proud and grateful to be an out, gay man working in a high-profile media role. During the pandemic, I\u2019ve tried not to spend too much time navel-gazing \u2026 but I\u2019ve become more aware of how [my partner] David and I respond to certain situations, and which coping mechanisms work best for us. And like so many people, we\u2019ve had to adjust to spending far more time together. That requires a new level of tolerance. My favourite way to spend weekends right now is \u2026 not to have any plans. I love just hanging out with David and our dogs at our home on the New South Wales South Coast. Some good food and wine and a couple of long walks on the beach. My number one tip when entertaining guests is \u2026 don\u2019t run out of wine when you live several kilometres from the nearest bottle shop. One thing you\u2019ll never understand about men \u2026 is their obsession with sport. I don\u2019t have that gene. And it takes courage to admit that in Australia. The book I\u2019m reading at the moment is \u2026 The Glossy Years by Nicholas Coleridge. The destination I\u2019d like to visit post-pandemic is \u2026 Spain. One of our dearest friends is Spanish and we want to experience it through her eyes. The one quote that I\u2019ve read that has stayed with me is \u2026 \u201cA home without books is like a face without eyes.\u201d My favourite way to wind down is \u2026 with a glass of chardonnay and ABC Classic. Does that sound seriously middle-aged? I think so. Thomas Mitchell A freelance journalist who has penned columns for titles including The Guardian, Thomas Mitchell has spent many years observing and writing about the unique behaviour of the Australian male. The beauty of being a man in 2020 is \u2026 that the nostalgic view of men as strapping-yet-emotionless has largely been stamped out - you can be whoever you want to be. But I think the best way to be a good man is simply to be a good person, while also being aware of the long history of entitlement and privilege that men have benefited from. I feel like I used to equate being a good friend with simply giving good advice \u2026 because the idea of a \u201ctop bloke\u201d was someone who could fix things: fix a car, fix a drink, fix a friend. These days I understand the importance of listening. Something that I know to be true about men is \u2026 even if they pretend they\u2019re not, all men are terrified of turning into their fathers. Oscar Wilde said it best: \u201cAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does, and that is his.\u201d Also, every man wants to believe they suit hats, even when so few of us do. The pandemic has strengthened my idea of what it means to support my partner. My fianc\u00e9e, Kate, and I were meant to get married on 2 May, but then Covid took off and we had to cancel our wedding six weeks out. We\u2019ve since had to change location (twice), and with each setback, one of us will inevitably max out. Either way, I\u2019ve come to appreciate what it means to lean heavily on someone. I reckon men, on the whole, have probably felt lonelier during lockdown. Men are less likely to call their mates up for a chat. Women tend to be better at maintaining social connections, which is why so many men end up old, weird and friendless. Since Covid, though, catching up on the weekend or seeing each other at work is less of a given, so you\u2019ve probably got a lot of guys out there spending the whole week wondering what their mates are doing, but not actually checking in. The podcast I love listening to is \u2026 The Guardian Football Weekly (really!). I listen every Tuesday and Friday. I never read sports biographies, but I just finished \u2026 When Nothing Else Matters by Michael Leahy. It\u2019s about Michael Jordan\u2019s comeback to the NBA, playing for the Washington Wizards. A sobering reminder that things never end well if you hold on too long. My favourite way to wind down is \u2026 walking about the suburbs at dusk. No problem is impossible to solve in the dying daylight. Janoah van Kekem Janoah van Kekem is a meditation teacher and co-founder of MoMENtum, a men\u2019s wellness and performance organisation. His messaging in both fields is all about challenging and championing male clients to be better versions of themselves. It\u2019s taken me a bloody long time to get my head around the definition of the modern man. It\u2019s about managing the balance between resilience (strength, authenticity and confidence) and heart (emotional intelligence, awareness and empathy). I used to associate success with \u2026 money, women, job title, holidays and making sure everyone knew about it. I have done a lot of work around what values are really important to me and I think true success is getting clear on your core values and living a life in line with that. I like early mornings: sunrise, meditate, coffee and some reading. Throughout the day I like freedom, being able to do whatever. Maybe I train, maybe I do an hour or two of work, and being near the ocean is huge for me. I also love an afternoon drink. Throw me a Manhattan or dirty martini with some mates and we are good to go. I like science and proof \u2026 so I understand the scepticism around meditation. It has transformed how I perform in all areas of my life - business, relationships - and I am in the best physical and mental shape I have ever been in. The last few months have been somewhat of a transformation and a challenge. I sold everything I own, left my house and hit the road to start a new business with a couple of mates. The world changed quickly and I have just had to roll with the punches and live a bit like a nomad, while trying to grow two businesses. The lockdown has done nothing but strengthen me. It has highlighted important things to me, and areas I need to work on as well as the importance of not getting attached to things and outcomes. It has brought on a whole new level of resilience. Constantly being able to grow and learn and slowly hone the type of man I want to be is what keeps me motivated. I have also created a world where my job is about having impact on others. Some days I just don\u2019t feel it, but then I remember the feeling after working with someone and they say how much it has changed their lives. This drives me to get out of my own way. The book I can\u2019t put down is \u2026 No More Mr Nice Guy by Robert Glover. It\u2019s a game changer. My favourite way to wind down is \u2026 sunset at the beach, a bourbon, a late arvo cheese board and hanging with someone who I can chew the fat with \u2026 or all of them at once.
