Alas, he appears to have no idea how far his organisation has been hijacked by the genetic modification (GM) companies and their chums. This week, the academy is hosting a \"week of study\" about food, and Sorondo says the intention has been to gather \"an objective\" group of experts. Ho-hum. Of the 40 people invited, all are well-known GM enthusiasts, claims Spinwatch, an independent organisation that \"monitors the role of public relations and spin in contemporary society\". One of the participants, Eric Sachs, is a Monsanto employee; another, Robert Paarlberg, is an adviser to Monsanto's CEO; and several others work for companies heavily backed by Monsanto. So who could have invited this esteemed group to Rome? It seems the organisation was left to Ingo Potrykus, developer of GM \"Golden Rice\". This is the man who accused opponents of GM of \"crimes against humanity\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
