The bombshell allegations by Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, were batted away by CIA director John Brennan, who said they went \u201cbeyond the scope of reason\u201d. But they revealed growing strains at the heart of Washington\u2019s intelligence establishment about the agency\u2019s power and accountability. In a dramatic speech on the floor of the US Senate, Feinstein accused the CIA of potentially violating the US constitution and of criminal activity in its attempts to obstruct her committee\u2019s investigations into the agency\u2019s use of torture in the aftermath of 9/11. She described the crisis as a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for political oversight of the US intelligence service. The White House sought to avoid taking sides in the dispute, saying Barack Obama was aware of the Senate claims but refused to comment on the substance of the allegations or say whether the president was concerned. \u201cThis is a matter involving protocols established for the interaction between committee staff and the CIA,\u201d said spokesman Jay Carney. \u201cThere are periodic disputes about this process and it is under two separate investigations, so I am not going to provide an analysis of it.\u201d But senior Senate Democrats continued to back Feinstein\u2019s unprecedented public attack, calling on the president to allow swift publication of an unclassified version of her committee\u2019s report into the CIA\u2019s interrogation activities. \u201cI support Senator Feinstein unequivocally, and I am disappointed that the CIA is apparently unrepentant for what I understand they did,\u201d Senate majority leader Harry Reid told reporters. Senator Ron Wyden, a long-time critic of intelligence overreach, told CNN: \u201cThe bottom line is: I am becoming convinced the CIA is simply fearful of the interrogation report being made public, and I think it\u2019s time for the American people to get that information.\u201d The CIA is refusing to back down, raising the prospect of Obama being forced to choose whether to support his party or the intelligence community. \u201cWe are not in any way, shape or form trying to thwart this report,\u201d said Brennan at a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAs far the allegations of the CIA hacking into Senate computers are concerned, nothing could be further from the truth. We wouldn\u2019t do that; that\u2019s beyond the scope of reason.\u201d Observers noted that Feinstein did not allege \u201chacking\u2019\u201d but detailed an alleged unauthorised search of a computer system provided to Senate staff by intelligence officers. Beyond Brennan\u2019s general remarks, the CIA did not offer a detailed rebuttal of Feinstein\u2019s allegations. \u201cBrennan is up to his eyeballs in trouble,\u201d said Amy Zegart, co-director of the Center for International Security and Co-operation at Stanford University. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to stonewall congressional intelligence staffers, quite another to be charged with spying on them for doing their jobs. For years, Feinstein has had the CIA\u2019s back. Now she\u2019s out for blood. How the CIA managed to turn one of its staunchest defenders into one of its fiercest critics is just mind boggling.\u201d In her speech, Feinstein, who said she was making her statement \u201creluctantly\u201d, confirmed recent reports that the committee believed CIA officials had monitored on at least two occasions the computer networks used by Senate staffers working on the torture investigation. Going further than previously, she accused the CIA of revoking access to documents containing evidence of torture that would incriminate intelligence officers. She also alleged that anonymous CIA officials were effectively conducting a smear campaign in the media to discredit and \u201cintimidate\u201d Senate staff by suggesting they had hacked into the agency\u2019s computers to obtain a separate, critical internal report on the detention and interrogation programme. Staff working on the Senate investigation have been reported to the Department of Justice for possible criminal charges by a lawyer at the CIA who himself features heavily in the alleged interrogation abuses. The CIA\u2019s inspector general is conducting another inquiry into the issue. Feinstein said the two investigations, launched at the behest of the CIA, amounted to an attempt at \u201cintimidation\u201d. She revealed that CIA officials had also been reported to the Department of Justice for alleged violations of the fourth amendment and laws preventing them from domestic spying. \u201cThis is a defining moment for the oversight role of our intelligence committee \u2026 and whether we can be thwarted by those we oversee,\u201d said Feinstein in a special address on the floor of the the US Senate. \u201cThere is no legitimate reason to allege to the Justice Department that Senate staff may have committed a crime \u2026 this is plainly an attempt to intimidate these staff and I am not taking it lightly.\u201d Feinstein said that she would immediately appeal to the White House to declassify the report\u2019s major findings. The White House is formally on record supporting the declassification, which the president has the power to order. At the previously scheduled event reflecting on the first year in the job on Tuesday, Brennan rejected the accusation that the CIA had thwarted the Senate investigation, and denied the agency had inappropriately accessed Senate computers. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. We wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. Brennan pointed out that he had referred the matter to the CIA inspector general, who was investigating, and would defer to his conclusions. He also acknowledged there was a Justice Department investigation that encompassed the Senate committee staff members. \u201cThere are appropriate authorities are looking at what CIA officers and SSCI staff members did \u2013 and I defer to them as to whether there was any violation,\u201d he said. Brennan said the CIA wanted to put the issue of the torture programme, which he described by its agency nomenclature as \u201crendition, detention and interrogation\u201d, behind it. \u201cEven as we have learned from the past, we must also try to put the past behind us.\u201d he said. On the Senate floor earlier, Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the judiciary committee and the longest serving US senator, described Feinstein\u2019s speech at the most important he had witnessed in his time in Congress. \u201cI cannot think of any speech by any member of any party as important as the one the senator from California just gave,\u201d Leahy said. Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, an intelligence committee member, said in a statement he applauded Feinstein for \u201csetting the record straight today on the Senate floor about the CIA\u2019s actions to subvert congressional oversight\u201d. He accused the CIA of \u201ctrying to hide the truth from the American people about this program\u201d and sad it had \u201cillegally\u201d searched the committee\u2019s computers. One of the points at issue between the CIA and the Senate intelligence committee is the ownership of the Senate\u2019s investigation. In a recent court case seeking to prevent public release of the Senate\u2019s inquiry, the CIA argued that the inquiry was the exclusive property of the Senate. A \u201ckey principle\u201d in a 2009 accord between the intelligence agency and the Senate intelligence committee, was that committee staffers\u2019 work \u201cwould not become \u2018agency records\u2019\u201d and were the \u201cproperty of the committee,\u201d CIA congressional liaison Neal Higgins told a court in February. Higgins\u2019s statement took on new salience on Tuesday in the light of Feinstein\u2019s revelation that the CIA had searched the secure computer network it set up at a Virginia facility for the committee\u2019s classified use. \u201cThis search involved not only a search of documents provided to the committee by the CIA, but also a search of the \u2018stand alone\u2019 and \u2018walled-off\u2019 committee network drive containing the committee\u2019s own internal work product and communications,\u201d said Feinstein, who said she considered the search an effort at \u201cintimidation\u201d to undermine the Senate committee\u2019s oversight responsibilities. In Higgins\u2019s filing to deny the case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, he acknowledged that work by the committee \u201cremain congressional records in their entirety\u201d. That meant they were not CIA records and could not be released under the Freedom of Information Act. A member of the Senate committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, cited Higgins\u2019s filing as contradicting the basis for what he called an \u201cunprecedented invasion\u201d of CIA computers. \u201cThe CIA\u2019s own recent court filing makes clear that the work product on these computers was and is \u2018the property of the committee\u2019,\u201d Wyden said in a Tuesday statement. \u201cI share [Feinstein\u2019s] concern that this search may have violated both federal law and the US constitution.\u201d Both Brennan and his CIA deputy, Avril Haynes, are former White House staffers, trusted by President Obama. Brennan \u2013 who last week blasted senators on the committee for \u201cspurious allegations\u201d about his agency \u2013 batted away a question about his resignation. \u201cIf I did something wrong, I will go to the president, and I will explain to him exactly what I did, and what the findings were. And he is the one who can ask me to stay or to go,\u201d Brennan said. Additional reporting by Nora Biette-Timmons"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
