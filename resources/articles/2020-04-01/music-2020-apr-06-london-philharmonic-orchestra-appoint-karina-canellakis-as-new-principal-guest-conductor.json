Canellakis, 38, began her career as a violinist, performing as soloist, chamber and orchestral musician. She played for two years with the Berlin Philharmonic as a member of its Academy Orchestra, then spent several years with the Chicago Symphony. She has also appeared as a guest leader of orchestras including the Bergen Philharmonic. She began conducting professionally in 2013 and made her European debut in 2015. Canellakis burst on to the British orchestral scene last summer when she conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the opening night of the Proms. But her relationship with the London Philharmonic Orchestra began the previous autumn when she made her debut with them at the Royal Festival Hall. The spark was immediate, she says. \u201cWe musically fell in love with each other. Our temperaments are perfectly matched,\u201d she says. \u201cThe LPO can literally play anything, and they can do it so quickly that the amount of rehearsal time they need to get to the absolute highest level is so small that I was amazed and impressed. \u201cWe can create something really special in all the different corners of the repertoire I want to explore together.\u201d Canellakis grew up in a musical family in New York, her mother a pianist and her father a conductor, and she took conducting classes on the side while majoring in violin studies. \u201cI had always loved it and was fascinated by scores,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never occurred to me that this was not something for a girl to do.\u201d As a violinist, she always yearned to see the full orchestral picture. \u201cI felt slightly frustrated by only being able to see the violin line. Each break I\u2019d look at the score, dying to know the details of the other instruments and why it sounded that way, why I got goosebumps at certain moments, and how you can physically translate that to a large group of people with your hands and your face without making a sound. It\u2019s an amazing feat of human communication.\u201d Simon Rattle spotted the young violinist\u2019s interest in conducting when she was part of the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s orchestra academy from 2005-07, and encouraged her to develop her talent. \u201cMoving away from the violin was terrifying because I love playing and I had a great life as a violinist,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I felt this fire inside of me that if I didn\u2019t give conducting a shot I would regret it. After two years in the Juilliard School\u2019s conducting programme, in 2016 she won the prestigious Georg Solti conducting award. Her rise to the top of the profession has been rapid by any standards. Last month Canellakis made her debut with the London Symphony Orchestra, and she has appeared as a guest with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the symphony orchestras of San Francisco and Minnesota, and the Munich Philharmonic. \u201cMy role models were the inspiring people I played under: Boulez. Rattle. Haitink \u2026 and my teachers \u2026 Alan Gilbert and Fabio Luisi,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been at the receiving end of comments about my gender. I\u2019m part of a generation who doesn\u2019t need to worry about it. I have only ever thought about conductors in terms of what they brought to the sound.\u201d The era of the dictator conductor \u2013 the \u201cmaestro\u201d \u2013 is long gone, she says. \u201cThe role of a conductor is much more collegial and collaborative than it used to be. You want to make music with the orchestra, not impose your concept of a piece on it.\u201d She concedes that the shift from player to podium was a leap. \u201cYou have to adjust your sense of identity and learn that you are the boss,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is your responsibility how this rehearsal goes \u2013 which means everything from the atmosphere, the way you speak to people, how efficient you are with the rehearsal time. You need to be able to assess very quickly what needs work and what you can leave for the next day.\u201d In a period of global lockdown, live music seems a more precious asset than ever. \u201cThis crisis can allow many of us a moment to reflect on what we are truly grateful for,\u201d says Canellakis. \u201cI feel hope and inspiration when I think about going back to rehearsing and performing with my colleagues, coupled with fear and sadness because it\u2019s become painfully clear that music is my life and my life is music \u2013 without being able to share that sacred, magical world with colleagues and audiences, my daily existence loses its most essential core.\u201d Canellakis is scheduled to conduct four Royal Festival Hall concerts with the LPO in the 2020/21 season. Her first concert with them, on 3 October, will pair Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No 8 with John Adams\u2019s concerto for string quartet, Absolute Jest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
