Last Sunday, while the other four players contested the Premier League match between Everton and Tottenham Hotspur, Lundstram was pursuing his football education at Oxford United, having turned down a new contract at Everton in the summer. \u201cIt was the best decision I ever made,\u201d says the 21-year-old midfielder who aims to show on Sunday, when Oxford host Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup, that he has what it takes to graduate back to the elite. Lundstram was nominated for the League Two player-of-the-month award for December and feels that his career is finally taking flight. It is doing so partially because he has learned to exert more control over the direction he takes. In 2013 he went to the World Cup on the back of impressive performances as a loanee at Doncaster Rovers, whom he helped to the League One title, and with high hopes of breaking into the Everton first team. But that was also the summer in which Roberto Mart\u00ednez arrived at Goodison Park to replace David Moyes, under whom Lundstram had seemed poised to make a breakthrough. \u201cWhen David Moyes was at Everton I was in the squad and with the first team and doing really well but as soon as he left it just wasn\u2019t the same for me,\u201d says Lundstram without bitterness. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of opinions and I wasn\u2019t involved in the first team as much as I\u2019d have liked under Mart\u00ednez. I was meant to go on a pre-season tour with the first team when I came back from Doncaster and then, a couple of days before that, I got taken off the squad list to go and I was never told why. That knocked my confidence a bit and little things like that set me back a bit. Then I had to go on loan to Yeovil.\u201d Yeovil were bottom of the Championship and their style did not suit a player whose main quality is his expansive passing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right club because we never had the ball,\u201d he says, raising an issue that affects many young players\u2019 development: in three years as a professional at Everton he went to five different clubs on loan and wishes he had been more assertive about his moves. \u201cIf I had my time again, I\u2019d have more say in where I went and would say \u2018no\u2019 to some things. But I was just trying to please the manager and saying \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 all the time.\u201d When his contract expired at Goodison last summer Everton offered him a six-month deal but this time he did say no. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel it was worth wasting any more time, so I just wanted to get out there and start playing first-team football regularly \u2013 and not on loan for once. It definitely makes a difference being permanent. You just feel much more part of things.\u201d Lundstram is certainly a crucial part of an Oxford team that stands third in League Two. Liam Sercombe and Kemar Roofe tend to score the goals but Lundstram usually conducts the attacking. \u201cI just want to get on the ball as much as I can,\u201d he says. That is a common aim throughout the team, which is why Swansea are fitting opponents: since being taken over by the businessman Darryl Eales in 2014, Oxford have made no secret of their ambition to emulate the Welsh club by ascending from the bottom league to the top while playing a slick, possession-based style. \u201cThere are a couple more teams in League Two who also want to play that way but I believe we\u2019re the best at it,\u201d says Lundstram. Promotion is this season\u2019s main aim and, since Oxford do not have an enormous squad, it will be a challenge to continue competing on all fronts. Indeed, they go into the Swansea game with their manager, Michael Appleton, grappling with the difficult issue of whether to rest players for Thursday\u2019s first leg of the Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy area final against Millwall \u2013 victory in that tie would secure a rare Wembley appearance for Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s well documented how important the promotion push is but all the lads want to get to Wembley as well so the JPT is massive for us,\u201d says Lundstram, who adds that the Swansea match is \u201ca no-pressure game really\u201d. It is, however, a match in which the players yearn to make a statement. \u201cA lot of the lads here are good enough to play at the highest level and I think everyone\u2019s mindset is we\u2019re going to go out and prove how good we all are,\u201d says Lundstram. In a season in which Jamie Vardy and Dele Alli have shown that real talent can be found in the lower leagues, Oxford want to provide further evidence. \u201cWith all the money involved in the Premier League it\u2019s tough for a young English lad to come in but there are definitely some gems in the Football League who could play at the top,\u201d says Lundstram. \u201cIt\u2019s just about getting the chance.\u201d On Sunday Lundstram and his team-mates have a chance to make their point. Mind you, while watching the draw Lundstram hoped he would be given an opportunity to make it against someone else: \u201cI was clutching the couch hoping for it to be Everton and then I definitely would have had something to prove,\u201d he says with a benign laugh. \u201cBut this is a great tie \u2013 and, if we get through, I\u2019ll be begging for Everton.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
