Villa finished 17th last term, one position above the bottom three, and there are fears that a sixth successive relegation battle beckons after a dismal run in which they have picked up only one point from their last seven matches. The Villa board is deeply concerned and Sherwood\u2019s position has come under scrutiny but it is understood no specific timeframe has been put on the manager\u2019s future, despite reports that he must win one of the next two matches, against Chelsea away on Saturday and Swansea at home seven days later, to save his job. Appointed eight months ago and praised for keeping Villa in the Premier League, Sherwood admitted to \u201cfeeling the pressure\u201d and said he is realistic enough to realise he must start winning. He claimed, however, that nobody at Villa had told him that he has two games left and was in bullish mood as he predicted that the fans will be singing his name in four weeks\u2019 time and added that he is 100% sure they will avoid relegation. Yet Sherwood did also admit that Villa are struggling to adjust to life after Benteke, who joined Liverpool for \u00a332.5m after almost single-handedly keeping the club up in each of the previous three seasons, with the Belgian scoring 42 and setting up eight of their 105 Premier League goals since his debut in September 2012. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t have a clause in his contract then \u00a3100m wouldn\u2019t have taken him away from us,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t worth selling for any money. No money can guarantee you Premier League survival \u2013 that player could.\u201d Sherwood compared the loss of Benteke, and the impact it has had on the team, to Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s departure at Liverpool and Gareth Bale\u2019s exit at Tottenham Hotspur. He also said that Fabian Delph and Tom Cleverley are badly missed. \u201cIt\u2019s all relative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe scraped through relegation last season and were the worst team left in the Premier League. We lost our three best players and that should put it in perspective. I\u2019ve seen it first-hand, I\u2019ve seen a lot of players come in to try and replace one; it\u2019s difficult. You do drop \u2013 we can\u2019t afford to drop. We have to make sure we stay at least where we were, and higher. That\u2019s the size of the task ahead. We knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy and I think all the decision-makers at the club appreciated that.\u201d Villa made 13 signings last summer, with the majority of them new to the Premier League, and although Sherwood said that not one arrived without his approval \u2013 \u201cYou don\u2019t always get what you want but certainly every player who came in is a name I would have cast my eye over\u201d \u2013 he admitted that he could not guarantee when everything would click. \u201cYou can only speed up the process by doing what we\u2019re doing on the training pitch,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no magic wand. You have more assurances if you know that people have played in the league before. It\u2019s difficult. The group we\u2019ve got, I\u2019m pleased with. But they\u2019re the unknown in this division, one million per cent.\u201d Villa\u2019s style of play, which was so entertaining under him last season, has been nothing like as exciting and questions have also been asked about the manager\u2019s tactics and the formations he has deployed at times. Sherwood, who described Saturday\u2019s Chelsea game as \u201calmost a free shot\u201d for Villa, said that losing Delph, Cleverley and Benteke had forced him to adopt a different approach. \u201cI love to have a go every game but you work with what you\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cI want everyone to be as good as Benteke or as lively as Delph but we\u2019re working with a different group and you have to find a way which is best for the team. Sometimes you can\u2019t play the swashbuckling style because of the personnel. Now Adama [Traor\u00e9] might be able to give us that \u2013 he\u2019s certainly looked better this week and he can be a swashbuckling player. But we\u2019re talking about a 19-year-old boy who\u2019s come from League Two in Spain, which I could still play in with respect.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
