Adelson, who used his $25bn fortune to back Newt Gingrich and then Mitt Romney as Republican candidates for president, at times expressed outrage at what he said were \u201cdelusional and fabricated\u201d allegations against him and his company. The hearing was called to decide a jurisdictional issue \u2013 whether the case should be heard in Las Vegas where Adelson\u2019s company is based or Macau where the allegations are focused. But the high stakes involved were demonstrated by the presence of a Las Vegas gaming commission official monitoring the case because it potentially has implications for the licensing of Adelson\u2019s Las Vegas Sands casino empire. Adelson is being sued for wrongful dismissal and defamation by the former CEO of his highly profitable operations of a Las Vegas Sands subsidiary in the Chinese enclave of Macau. Steven Jacobs says he was fired in 2010 because he objected to what he alleges were excessive payments to a Macau lawyer and legislator, Leonel Alves, on the grounds they may breach US bribery laws and because he opposed doing business with groups tied to Chinese organised crimes groups, the Triads. Adelson authorised a $700,000 payment in legal fees to Alves, who described himself as \u201cuniquely situated both as counsel and legislator\u201d to serve Las Vegas Sands in Macau. The company\u2019s in-house lawyers warned that the payment was far in excess of normal rates and could violate US law because Alves could be using his position as a legislator to influence officials. Alves played several roles. A key one was in mending relations with Chinese and Macau officials who disliked Adelson\u2019s apparently forthright and brusque manner. He also represented Las Vegas Sands in meetings with Macau politicians and officials to apply \u201cpressure\u201d on behalf of the company. According to internal emails submitted to the court, Alves wrote to Jacobs saying he could resolve several issues the company was facing, one to do with property and another to settle a lawsuit, for a payment of $300m. Jacobs raised questions about the payments to Alves and eventually ended his contract with the casino company. Adelson then ordered him rehired. In testy exchanges with Jacobs\u2019 lawyer in court on Tuesday, Adelson insisted that Jacobs\u2019 dismissal had nothing to do with the objections he raised to Alves. Adelson, who walked slowly to the stand with the assistance of his wife, said he had not been involved in hiring Alves and that the first he knew of the Macau legislator was when Jacobs raised questions about him. \u201cIt was the dispute about Mr Jacobs not wanting to pay him that brought it to my attention,\u201d said Adelson. But pressed on whether he had then directed that Alves be rehired after Jacobs dismissed him, Adelson was initially evasive until he confirmed that he had \u201crecommended\u201d the legislator be taken back on. Adelson portrayed himself as a distant authority and strategic guide for the company who was \u201cnot hiring and firing the housekeeping department\u201d when it came to Alves. \u201cThere\u2019s no way any one person can operate an 8,000-mile-away property,\u201d he said of the Macau operation. But Jacobs\u2019 lawyer questioned Adelson on emails which appeared to show a much more hands-on involvement than he admitted to. One demanded to know if Jacobs had carried out Adelson\u2019s order to make changes to the Macau casino floor because a restaurant was hindering access to some of the gambling tables. \u201cWas that done? And, if so, can I see the new layout?\u201d said the email, which was shown in court. Adelson and Jacobs also differed on the use of \u201cjunket reps\u201d who bring high-roller gamblers from China to Macau. Jacobs regarded them as bringing relatively low returns and wanted to stop the relationship because of their alleged links to organised crime. In court, Adelson accused Jacobs of \u201cnearly destroying the business\u201d because he wanted to end the use of junket reps. \u201cHe wanted to throw out 50% or 60% of the income by throwing out the junkets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was insanity. He purposely tried to kill the company.\u201d Adelson was not asked if he knew of links to organised crime. But according to documents revealed by the case and the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley, Las Vegas Sands extended over $30m in credit to a junket backed by a Hong Kong businessman, Cheung Chi Tai, named in a US Senate report as the leader of a Chinese organised crime group. Adelson\u2019s deep personal animosity toward Jacobs revealed itself several times. He accused his former employee of trying to harass and embarrass him with \u201cfabricated stories\u201d. Adelson said Jacobs was dismissed for 35 transgressions, \u201ceach of which was justified for termination for cause\u201d. These included going behind his back to take his concerns to individual board members. Jacobs claims that Adelson stopped him from revealing to the board a consultant\u2019s report that the junket reps were linked to the Triads and the risk of payments to Alves being illegal under US law. Jacobs\u2019 lawsuit says that \u201cAdelson reminded Jacobs that he was both the chairman and the controlling shareholder and that Jacobs should \u2018do as I please\u2019\u201d. When Jacobs expressed concern that Las Vegas casino regulators might regard the payments as illegal, the lawsuit says: \u201cAdelson scoffed at the suggestion, informing Jacobs that he, Adelson, controlled the regulators, not the other way around.\u201d Adelson\u2019s claims ran into problems when he was confronted with emails that showed other members of the company board had a high opinion of Jacobs. One email to a company director written by Adelson\u2019s deputy, Michael Leven, described Jacobs as having saved the Macau operation from going under. \u201cThere\u2019s no question as to Steve\u2019s performance. The Titanic hit the iceberg and he not only saved the passengers, he saved the ship,\u201d it said. The board member, David Turnbull, replied: \u201cWell put indeed.\u201d In court, Adelson responded by saying Jacobs had \u201chypnotised\u201d Leven. \u201cI ordered him months prior that to fire him,\u201d he said. Adelson at one point expressed outrage at the implication of the allegations against him. \u201cNot once in 69 years has anybody said this is a bad thing that Sheldon Adelson did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all delusional and fabricated.\u201d Lowell Bergman and Matt Isaacs at the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley contributed to reporting on this story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
