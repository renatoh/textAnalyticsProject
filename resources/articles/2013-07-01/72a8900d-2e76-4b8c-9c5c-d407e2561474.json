This is to overlook Sue Barker, who won the French Open in 1976, and Wimbledon winners Dorothy Round in 1937, Angela Mortimer in 1961, Ann Haydon-Jones in 1969 and Virginia Wade in 1977. A review of Harry Eyres's latest book, Horace and Me: Life Lessons From an Ancient Poet, referred to the author's partner as a financial journalist. She is a foreign correspondent. The author has asked us to make clear that the statement: \"Eyres himself, he informs us, is a scion of 'the Catholic aristocracy'\" is a misquotation and that he actually said \"the blood of true-blue Catholicism ran nowhere in my veins\" (\"Tipsy travels with a poetic Latin lover\", New Review, last week, page 38). Some readers were puzzled by a reference in a Comment piece, \"Labour's big problem isn't being different: it's how to look credible\" (30 June, page 31), to an Opinium poll published that day, but could not find it in the paper. The article about the poll only appeared on our website and can be found at http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/observer-opinium-politics-polls+polls.
