The Times report cited two US Naval Academy classmates close to Crozier\u2019s family. The details of Crozier\u2019s condition were unclear. Crozier was dismissed as captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, after writing a letter alerting navy leaders that Covid-19 aboard the vessel was threatening the lives of his sailors. \u201cThe spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating,\u201d he wrote. As he left the ship following his dismissal, Crozier was cheered exuberantly by his former crew. On Saturday, Donald Trump said he did not think Crozier should have written the letter, which he said was a \u201cterrible\u201d thing to do. \u201cThe letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place,\u201d Trump said at a White House briefing. \u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d \u201cI thought it was terrible, what he did, to write a letter. I mean, this isn\u2019t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that\u2019s nuclear powered. And he shouldn\u2019t be talking that way in a letter.\u201d The Washington Post has reported that acting navy secretary Thomas Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d The president said: \u201cI didn\u2019t make the decision.\u201d Defense secretary Mark Esper defended the decision to dismiss Crozier on cable news on Sunday morning, saying \u201cwhen all those facts come to bear we\u2019ll have a chance to understand\u201d why the decision was taken. Esper told CNN\u2019s State of the Union he supported the decision to relieve Crozier, which he said was made by navy leadership, but \u201cthere is an investigation ongoing\u201d. Esper said \u201cwe need to take care of the sailors on the ship\u201d, adding that there have been 155 positive coronavirus tests on the Roosevelt. Presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called Crozier\u2019s dismissal \u201cclose to criminal\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s close to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy,\u201d the former vice-president told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cThe idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his navy personnel were in danger \u2026 Look how many have the virus. \u201cI think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
