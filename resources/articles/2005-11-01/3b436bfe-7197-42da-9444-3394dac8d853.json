The manager, however, wants his players to concentrate on the game - which is crucial if Rangers are to become the first Scottish club to reach the knock-out stages of the competition. \"I really don't think it's appropriate to talk about that stuff just now when the stakes are so high. It's not fair to put that sort of pressure on the players when we have such an important game coming up. It's a fantastic opportunity and we go into the game trying to take a positive result back to Scotland and keep the group stage very open.\" Rangers drew 0-0 with Artmedia at Ibrox two weeks ago and are level with the Slovakians in second place, two points behind the Group H leaders Internazionale but only a point ahead of Porto at the bottom. McLeish is confident the players can handle the pressure but admits he is the one who will have to pay the price if results do not improve. \"We haven't been getting the results domestically and that has put a bit of pressure on the manager and, ultimately, the buck stops with the manager,\" he said. \"I'm well aware of that. That's football. But I've got to be strong and show leadership and show the players that I'm willing to lead them into battle. \"People say it has come down to one game with regards to Alex McLeish but I have great faith in the guys. It's time to talk this team up.\" McLeish also revealed that his advice for the players as they head into the game against Artmedia will be borrowed from the Scotland manager and former Ibrox manager Walter Smith. \"Just win,\" he said. \"That's the message that I've always had from a good friend of mine, Walter Smith, every time he texts me. That's the simple message.\" Artmedia Bratislava's coach Vladimir Weiss, meanwhile, does not expect a repeat of their 5-0 win over Celtic, achieved in the qualifying rounds, when they take on their Scottish rivals. \"The Celtic result would happen only once in a 100 years,\" he said. \"This is a different match from the Celtic match but we still have a chance. Confidence is high and we are playing to win. We have had good results against better opposition.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
