As Marina, she was singer with Ojos de Brujo, the most successful experimental band in Barcelona, who deservedly won a Latin Grammy for their enthusiastic fusion work, mixing flamenco with anything from hip-hop and funk to jazz and Indian styles. The new Marinah takes a more commercial approach on her first solo album. Her self-composed \"world pop\" songs put an emphasis on breezy good-time ballads that are interrupted by instrumental passages from flamenco guitarists Dani de Mor\u00f3n or Ruben Labaniegos. Then there's a collaboration with Philippe Cohen Solel of the Gotan Project on the slower, slinky electro-tango of El Carrusel, while on Te Gust\u00f3 there's a romping dance work-out featuring Rold\u00e1n and Ruzzo from the Cuban hip-hop band, Orishas. Entertaining, but a little safe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
