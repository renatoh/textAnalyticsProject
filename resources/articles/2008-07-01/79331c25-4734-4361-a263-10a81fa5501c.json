The movie centres on two 18-year-old friends, whose allegiances shift between the warring factions as one searches for the father he has never seen, and the other comes to terms with parental responsibility when his wife leaves their son behind and goes to find a better job in S\u00e3o Paulo. It's a trifle glib and not quite in the front rank alongside City of God."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
