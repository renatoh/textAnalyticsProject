The subject of the Berlin Wall and its effect on East and West Germans is being explored in two film seasons: the Barbican\u2019s Borders and Boundaries, and Home in Manchester\u2019s Beyond the Berlin Wall, which focuses exclusively on female directors. Wieland Speck, the director of Westler, a drama about a gay romance divided by the wall that is described as \u201can unjustly neglected curio in queer cinema history\u201d, said lessons from Berlin continued to be ignored. \u201cYou don\u2019t see us learning from it at all, in fact the opposite is the case,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, these other walls and barriers are a sign of power. But also, I think it\u2019s a sign of powerlessness. Because it\u2019s the only thing you can do.\u201d Speck said Westler, part of which was filmed in East Berlin using hidden cameras that were banned at the time, shocked young contemporary audiences. \u201cYou have a romantic love story and you give it a little bit more weight by saying, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s not like a Grimm fairytale, this is actually what it was like\u2019. \u201cIt was one of the first gay films where the gays were not dead at the end.\u201d Speck believes the film was accepted by Germany and helped shift society because it presented a problem, the wall, that was bigger than homosexuality. Pia Frankenberg, the director of Never Sleep Again, which features in Beyond the Berlin Wall and focuses on three women navigating the city just after reunification, said she was not aware of how momentous the coming down of the wall was. \u201cIt was not like you really feel the importance of history in the moment \u2013 it just happens,\u201d she said. \u201cYou live through it.\u201d Frankenberg said her film was about a city coming to terms with a new reality but also three women who embraced their own personal freedom and a \u201cmore nonchalant way of living and doing the same things as men do but in their own way\u201d. Borders and Boundaries also has films that expand beyond the Berlin Wall, such as Simone Bitton\u2019s documentary, Wall, about the building of the separation wall in Israel. The film, which was made in 2004 and features interviews with construction workers who built the wall and those whose lives were disrupted by it, was \u201can act of resistance\u201d in a more insular post-September 11 world, she said. \u201cI think that this wall really became a state of mind for the whole planet,\u201d said Bitton, who thinks her film captured the start of a global movement whereby governments have moved away from a more pluralistic view of the world. \u201cIt was the first of a very, very long series of concrete and abstract walls that were erected. We are living in the period of walls and separation.\u201d Gali Gold, the Barbican\u2019s head of cinema, said its season showed how prominent the issues film-makers in Berlin struggled with before reunification still were. \u201cThe issue of border and a physical border resonates with the here and now and that was our opportunity to link to the here and now,\u201d she said. Gold added that \u201cBrexit looms large\u201d over the season but she wants it to be a chance to re-examine lessons from history. \u201cWe are making use of the fact it is a living experience \u2013 we want to open it up, look at it and question the notion that the subject is dry and institutional. Borders are only becoming more prevalent,\u201d she said. The Borders and Boundaries season runs at the Barbican from 8-27 November; Beyond the Berlin Wall is at Home Manchester from 24-26 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
