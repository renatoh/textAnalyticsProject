The final joint communique of the summit of G20 nations, issued yesterday, backs the principle of automatic exchange of tax information between all countries, both developed and developing. Much of the developing world is left out of bilateral and multilateral treaties that require the exchange of information on the tax affairs of companies and individuals. Some developed countries fear corruption makes it dangerous to widen such agreements to poorer states. The G20's supportive words give extra momentum for reform, although critics fear that genuine action will continue to be slow in coming. At the end of the summit, chancellor George Osborne said he believed progress was being made and revealed that Australia had committed to taking on the agenda when it hosts the G8 next year. He said: \"This weekend's agreement at the G20 to a new global tax standard for fighting evasion and addressing avoidance is an important step towards a global tax system that is fair and fit for purpose for the modern economy. The next step is to take these action plans and agreements and convert them into concrete reality.\" The communique said: \"We commend the progress recently achieved in the area of tax transparency and we fully endorse the OECD proposal for a truly global model for multilateral and bilateral automatic exchange of information. We are committed to making automatic exchange of information attainable by all countries, including low-income countries, and will seek to provide capacity-building support for them.\" This year the Observer revealed how a sugar-producing subsidiary of Associated British Foods \u2013 the maker of Silver Spoon sugar, Twinings Tea and Kingsmill bread \u2013 was avoiding tax in Zambia. Zambia Sugar paid very little corporation tax in the African state between 2007 and 2012, and none at all for two of those years. The company said it had taken advantage of tax relief and allowances, but an investigation by charity ActionAid revealed the existence of an additional array of transactions that reduce Zambia Sugar's taxable profits in the state, while the structure of others avoids Zambian taxes that are ordinarily levied on foreign payments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
