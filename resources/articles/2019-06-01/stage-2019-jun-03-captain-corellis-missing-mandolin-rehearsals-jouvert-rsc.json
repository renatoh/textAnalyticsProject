Just as rehearsals are ending for J\u2019Ouvert, a new play set at the Notting Hill Carnival, one of the three actors has dropped out, injured. There\u2019s no slack in fringe theatre, and no understudies either. A new actor, Sapphire Joy, arrives on the penultimate day of rehearsals. An already tight process has been tightened. Things were tricky when I visited three days earlier \u2013 rehearsal was cancelled due to the injury and a bereavement. Yet a resolute team, headed by writer Yasmin Joseph and director Rebekah Murrell, keep their sights on making magic even as time and money are running out. As audience members, we recognise resources in terms of cast size or fancy effects. But do we understand how fundamentally time is money in theatre? And how the length of rehearsal period impacts decision-making? I visited three productions of different scales in their third week of rehearsal to taste the atmosphere and gauge how much is already set in stone. At the RSC, with eight weeks to rehearse Measure for Measure, week three is still early days. For Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin, a touring adaptation of the much-loved novel that has since announced a West End transfer, week three is dead centre. And for J\u2019Ouvert, this is the final week before they enter the tiny but intrepid Theatre 503. Still, as Murrell says, \u201cDoes any actor ever feel they\u2019ve had enough time? There\u2019s always more you can do, moments you can finesse. You always feel, Oh, just one more week.\u201d How about five more? For most theatres, an eight-week rehearsal represents an impossible luxury, but for RSC artistic director Greg Doran, whose directing career has unfolded in Stratford, and for whom Measure for Measure is his 28th Shakespeare, this is what he knows. Running a hand through his luxuriantly greyed mane, he outlines the process. In the first week, the actors read and discuss the text, translating it into modern English. No one speaks their own lines, so they all imbibe the wider play. Then, scene by scene they develop the show\u2019s architecture (\u201cthe big skeleton\u201d). Over eight weeks, ideas marinate. All British theatres tighten their belts till the ribs squeak, and Doran explains that he fights to maintain this lengthy rehearsal period. What if austerity bites? \u201cI hope we\u2019d make other changes. Part of the luxury is to spend this amount of time analysing the text. This 400-year-old language is difficult!\u201d We\u2019re in a warm, wooden studio. Tall windows look on to Avonside greenery. Alongside his fruit tea, Doran\u2019s desk is piled with editions of Measure \u2013 at least six, including a facsimile of the First Folio. When perplexed, everyone grabs a different edition and scours the footnotes. The actors tackle the central prison scenes. Most have script in hand, lines highlighted in pink or yellow. Antony Byrne\u2019s rumpled duke, in a slouchy hoodie, holds a big folder. There are questions: how do you greet a friar? Should the convicts proclaim their guilt? Should we see someone\u2019s lovechild? (Stage management find a pram.) Everyone here is playing in at least one other Shakespeare, so the schedule dovetails around matinees and understudy duties. The expansive rehearsal period resets the body clock. Performances develop at different rates: some already sharply etched, others still growing. Byrne sighs: \u201cI\u2019m clutching at straws.\u201d The initial sifting of the text comes into its own when a plot confusion arises. Everyone chips in, even if it\u2019s not their scene or character. And there\u2019s time. Time to step back and admire Shakespeare\u2019s craft (\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary bit of structure\u201d). Time to chuckle at mucky Jacobean wordplay or tweak a melancholy song. Doran keeps reminding people to keep the stakes high, his legs jiggling as he watches as if to turn up the tension. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing with that scene,\u201d he declares as the day ends, \u201cbut we know what we need to do.\u201d I visit rehearsals for Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin on the middle day of the middle week. The cast warm up as I arrive, Nessun Dorma blasting on the sound system. Most of the company is barefoot \u2013 including director Melly Still. They\u2019ve been working through around a dozen pages of script each day, and this morning must assemble a wordless montage leading from one summer to the next, while Alex Mugnaioni\u2019s Corelli sits on a box and strums his mandolin. Everything is in flux, but characters are already developed. The company\u2019s energy is like a class of super-smart students, needing to be kept focused but bubbling with ideas. \u201cLet\u2019s just start to craft it,\u201d says Still after the first pass. \u201cWe\u2019re going to condense it, making it a little more mercurial.\u201d Each time, actions sharpen, timing clicks into place. Throughout, Mugnaioni strums tirelessly, blowing on his fingertips, asking the stage manager if she has anything for \u201csuper sweaty\u201d fingers. At every pause, he tenderly nestles the mandolin in its case \u2013 so it\u2019s upsetting to read, only a couple of days later, that the 129-year-old instrument was lost on a train and hasn\u2019t been seen since. A new, authentic Neapolitan mandolin was sourced \u2013 as was a spare instrument, in case the new one went missing too. After lunch, I catch the tail end of a props meeting (\u201cThe chairs are fine, but the table\u2019s going to need some love.\u201d). Still protects the cast from anxiety yet pushes onwards, animating the stage directions in Rona Munro\u2019s script. \u201cKeep the danger alive,\u201d she counsels, \u201cwhere\u2019s the chord of tension?\u201d Next task is processing an icon around the village: \u201cHow the hell do we do a 500-year-old saint?\u201d She paces the floor and pulls an actor away to experiment with a broomstick and a cardboard box. Still dashes off, and after unexpectedly swapping dreams about wetting the bed, actors settle around the piano for a music rehearsal, some recording it on their phones for home practice. As evening approaches, the mandolin slips out of tune and the basses get the giggles. Home time. \u201cPub, anyone?\u201d Over in Elephant and Castle, J\u2019Ouvert\u2019s rehearsals are reaching their end in a small, light room, its glass walls bearing quotes from Alice Walker and Octavia Butler. It\u2019s a fraught day, working with Sapphire Joy to steep her in the play. Each scene is outlined on an A3 sheet beside the door, and Murrell talks Joy across the action: \u201cAs we\u2019re moving through, feel free to find your own wants.\u201d Joy\u2019s dauntless spirit suits her surname. It\u2019s not the lines that worry her, she says, but working the production\u2019s physicality into her body. Crackle-voiced Murrell speaks at top speed, an out-of-nowhere yawn the only sign of the toll this week must have taken. Yet the mood stays warm and focused, the team forming a companionable knot. \u201cWhat star sign are you, Sapphire?\u201d Joseph asks. \u201cPisces? Very organised.\u201d Organisation is essential here: Tobi Kyeremateng, the producer, is conscious of how money impacts time. \u201cIn creative conversations, you don\u2019t want to be the dream-killer,\u201d she says, looking up from mid-email. \u201cBut sometimes there are things we can\u2019t do.\u201d So how much would an extra week\u2019s rehearsal have cost? \u201c\u00a3425, with a discount and including VAT,\u201d she shoots back. \u201cThat\u2019s just for the space.\u201d Plus wages and everything else? \u201cIt would be upwards of two grand,\u201d Joseph replies. For a new play, Murrell considers, \u201ca three-week process is tough\u201d (they had six weeks when she appeared in Nine Night at the National Theatre last year). \u201cWhat is lost is that space for the actors to interrogate and explore.\u201d But constraints \u201crequire everybody involved to bring their A-game \u2013 everyone knows we\u2019ve got to get this done\u201d. Joseph\u2019s debut play is ambitious and lyrical, with its dream sequences and carnival in full swing. \u201cI worked up to rehearsal,\u201d she admits, her nails smoothly pink as sugar almonds. \u201cI would have liked to get a draft in far sooner, but I was doing that perfectionist thing \u2026 Being in a room of forthcoming, insightful actors also informed what I\u2019d written, and it began to evolve. Then, I reached a point in week two where I was like: I need to put a lid on this.\u201d Like everyone, she\u2019s trusting her instincts. Days later, indisposition causes another actor to pull out. Even before the cast changed, losing one of 18 rehearsal days was significant. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said we\u2019re exactly where I wanted to be,\u201d Murrell says. \u201cWe hoped by the end of the second week we\u2019d have the skeleton of the show and the third would be colouring in, but \u2013 things happen.\u201d \u2022 J\u2019Ouvert is at Theatre 503, London, until 22 June; Measure for Measure is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 28 June - 29 August, then touring; Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin is at Birmingham Repertory theatre until 15 June, then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
