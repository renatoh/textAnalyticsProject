Conqueror of Les Bleus in Paris last year, swapping Scotland blue for Birmingham's brought a rare draw at Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's Arsenal last month. Here, McLeish inflicted further ignominy upon France's premier coach with a late, late draw which then invited Manchester United to get back within striking distance of the Premier League's summit. As on that September night at Parc des Princes, James McFadden was the Scotsman's executioner-in-chief, winning and exquisitely converting a first-half free- kick, then solidly finishing a final-minute penalty kick. To add to the irony, both fouls were conceded by Frenchman - Mathieu Flamini's infraction obvious, Ga\u00ebl Clichy's far more marginal. If all that was harsh enough on an Arsenal side now without a victory in three matches, the game's ugliest moment broke bone, flesh, and, for a long period, spirit. Eduardo da Silva spent much of yesterday in a Birmingham hospital, the victim of a dangerous Martin Taylor challenge that broke his left leg. Eduardo's team-mates struggled to look at the injury and drifted out of the game until Wenger drove them back with a team talk that delivered two rapid Theo Walcott goals, but not a win. 'We have to take it,' said Wenger. 'We cannot change it, we have to look at ourselves and to fight against all that. I feel we should have finished the game early on and scored a third. We did not and that's why, any little mistake, you're caught.' 'A decisive period' of the season was how Wenger described his team's next half-dozen league matches - games that will decide if Arsenal return to Old Trafford in April with enough breathing space for another North-West blow-out. His first decision was to restore Manuel Almunia to his starting line-up, the keeper having recovered from injury and a virus. Before either team managed an attempt on goal both went a man down in an incident live television coverage deemed 'too horrific' to replay. Taylor received a red card for his tackle on Eduardo, in which the centre-back raised his studs off the ground and trapped Eduardo's leg, which hideously snapped. Eduardo was left prostrate as team-mates struggled to avoid vomiting at the sight of his twisted limb. Medics required seven minutes to carry off the Brazil-born Croatia international from the pitch, the player covered by a blanket and comforted by oxygen. As Arsenal struggled to offer a genuine threat, McFadden began to run at their defence. Midway through the half he snaked into the middle of four opponents, sending Flamini into a panic that ended in a foul. Twenty-two yards from goal, slightly to the right of centre, the Scot took the free-kick, lifting it sharply over the wall and down under the bar. Almunia got his fingers to the ball, but it was not enough. Shorn of his dreadlocks, Emmanuel Adebayor spurned three opportunities to equalise, heading wide and softly at Maik Taylor, then steering a Cesc F\u00e1bregas long ball over keeper and crossbar. McFadden might have extended Birmingham's lead, but missed the target under pressure from Philippe Senderos. His team playing as though the opposition had the man advantage, the test for Wenger was not so much tactical as psychological - to rouse his visibly unsettled team back to the form that had taken them to the top of the division. The effects were almost immediate. F\u00e1bregas stretched Maik Taylor with a curling strike, Alexander Hleb with a rising one and at the resulting corner the keeper went chasing F\u00e1bregas's delivery only to run into Liam Ridgewell. Adebayor won the header, Taylor flapped it on to Walcott, and the winger turned in his first Premier League goal. Hleb and F\u00e1bregas almost added to it before Walcott did. Again a F\u00e1bregas long ball unsettled the home defence, Ridgewell attempting to chest down, but only teeing it up for Walcott, who accelerated across the edge of the penalty area before screwing a shot beyond Taylor. 'We're going to win for Eduardo,' sang the away support. And that appeared that for the match. Arsenal hogged possession, but rejected their best chance to finish the game when Adebayor refused to square the ball to his least favourite team-mate, Nicklas Bendtner. The Dane was not amused. Still less so when Clichy stretched to clear from Stuart Parnaby in injury time, got studs to ball, but heard Mike Dean's whistle blown against him. William Gallas berated the referee, linesman and advertising hoarding before sinking distraught to the turf and staying there at the end. McFadden leathered the penalty over Almunia for a third goal in two games. 'He gave Arsenal some problems,' said McLeish. 'He's brought something different to the team, a bit of quality in the last third.' And a dagger to the French."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
