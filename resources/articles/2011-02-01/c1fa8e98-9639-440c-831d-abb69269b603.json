Diouf has signed on at Ibrox for the rest of the season after being deemed surplus to requirements at Blackburn Rovers. Only last month, the Senegalese player courted controversy by allegedly abusing the Queens Park Rangers striker Jamie Mackie as he lay on the pitch with a broken leg. Diouf's troubled time in England was notable for his spitting at both supporters and an opponent. Most pertinently given his latest move, Diouf was found guilty of spitting at Celtic supporters during a Uefa Cup tie in 2003. Celtic play Rangers on Sunday. \"You are obviously aware of those situations but things like that happen, players get involved in things like that a lot of the time,\" said the Rangers manager, Smith. \"He has had his periods but I have had players like that before. Hopefully when he comes up to us he will be remembered for his football and I am sure he will be. He is a good footballer. \"Things have happened with quite a number of players over the period. With all your players you just have to make sure that they have an awareness of what can happen in games if they don't keep their temper. But he is an experienced player and we need to help him to handle that.\" Smith took soundings from English-based coaches including Sam Allardyce, who managed Diouf at both Bolton and Blackburn, before making his move. \"Every one of them, despite saying that he has his moments, were very complimentary about him as a player, and obviously in a group situation he seems to be a really good lad who always gets on with his team-mates,\" Smith added. \"So these are all good aspects.\" Diouf could play some part tomorrow night as Rangers host Hearts. He is expected to attract abuse from rival supporters; especially those of Celtic, who visit Ibrox on Sunday. \"In Scotland that is part and parcel of it, isn't it?\" said Smith. \"Maybe particularly here in this country. But over the years we've had a number of players who have had to handle that and who have got on with it. I would hope that is what he would do.\" Smith has also welcomed the teenage Arsenal defender Kyle Bartley to Rangers, also on loan until the summer. \"He has been playing most games on loan at Sheffield United this season so he is coming on,\" said Smith. \"The people at Arsenal and at Sheffield United rate him very highly, so it will be good to have him. \"Our scouting reports in England have been very good about him, and with the way things are, and the games that we have, he will get opportunities to get games. By all accounts he is a young man who has got a really good future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
