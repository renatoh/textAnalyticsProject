A family holiday far too often means familiar food in a place that holds no surprises. Thankfully, many of you have written in to say that, while you may be a minority, there are still families who refuse to stick to the well beaten track. Cathy, a mature student and single mum, wrote, \"fear of unknown challenges prevents people going on adventures with their children. I think this is sad, as everyday life is awash with pretty unfulfilling challenges, such as shopping with reluctant, weary or demanding children.\" Cathy and her three-year-old son have backpacked around Europe with only a pushchair and one big rucksack. How to carry the kit and still have free hands to round up the herd was parents' major concern. Barbara Childs, with five-year-old twins and a nine year old, uses a canvas two-wheel shopping trolley. \"They carry far more than any rucksack and have the added advantage that the children beg to take turns pulling it,\" she says. She also recommends, when you have lots of luggage, putting the toddler on your back and the heavy load in the buggy. Elaine Halstead gives her three children their own small rucksacks, so she only has to carry her own clothes. Young Explorers (youngexplorers.co.uk) has a large selection of equipment for kids. Adult males were generally dismissed as useless when it came to carrying. Elaine Halstead said her husband even refused to come on family holidays, preferring to go climbing. Now he's her ex. We should take inspiration from the Victorian lady travellers. For Emily Lowe, author of Unprotected Females In Norway (1857), a family holiday meant with her mother. She wrote, \"The only use of a gentleman in travelling is to look after the luggage, and we take care to have no luggage.\" \u00b7 Please send tips for sharing to travelwithkids@aol.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
