This week we're in Devon, where the \"pavalovas\" (sic) resemble flattened meteorites and Karen's rosti is the colour of wall (\"I can't explain this\"). Frying pans clatter as jubilant toff Deborah serves up smashed sausages; calculating Darren hands out conciliatory cacti; and perfectionist Sarah expects a round of applause when she tells everyone she's 39. Non appetite. My Favourite Place 8pm, History Channel This week's edition comes from Cornwall's Tintagel Castle, where nice Charlotte Uhlenbroek gets in a flap over the legend of King Arthur. While archaeological finds suggest that Arthur was indeed an Arthur, it seems the more interesting bits of the legend were invented by a nobleman as a means of annoying the French. The 13th-century castle, meanwhile, was \"the first purpose-built tourist trap in Britain\": a theme park where medieval Arthur enthusiasts could presumably enjoy attractions such as Ye Non-Existent Inflatable Dragon and Ye Test Ye Strength Putative Excalibur Device\u2122. Margaret Thatcher: The Long Walk to Finchley 9pm, BBC4 In Tony Saint's romp, the former Miss Roberts (a twinkling Andrea Riseborough) pouts and badgers her way up the postwar political ladder, with her groundbreaking ploy of being a woman. Unlike previous political japes - Confessions of a Diary Secretary, The Trial of Tony Blair etc - the ridicule is reserved solely for the supporting characters, while Thatcher remains ... Thatcher. Implacable. Unfathomable. Could shatter a miner at 50 paces. Some may consider this a good thing. Dinner With Portillo 10.25pm, BBC4 Old rubber chops hosts another of his pie'n'politics soirees. Served as an adult-sized accompaniment to the preceding fluff (see above), it promises an in-depth discourse on the Iron Lady's early political career. Here, over an undisclosed menu (pension book \u00e0 l'orange?), Portillo will be joined by Baroness Shirley Williams, Lord Rees-Mogg and Lionel Shriver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
