His primary intention is to oversee the initial stages of the security to be put in place for the World Cup that begins there next February. There was a secondary matter, too, but the death of Hansie Cronje has put that on the back burner. The disgraced former South Africa captain was still under investigation for his leading part in the match-fixing scandal and, while there are sensitivities, his demise will not alter that situation. The appointment of Condon to set up an independent unit, with funds made available from the ICC, was a thoughtful one: it had been seeking a person of stature with legal or associated credentials and here was a vastly experienced policeman who, as a former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had possibly unparalleled contacts worldwide. Since the unit's inception in May 2000 the work has been ceaseless but for the most part unpublicised and unappreciated. Names other than those already in the domain when the unit started have not been named because, unless offenders are caught with their hands in the till, incontrovertible proof is hard to come by. There is a natural wastage and the priority has been to address future prevention. Condon believes that even since the formation of the unit match-fixing has gone on. Only last summer, for example, possible attempts to influence the outcome of one-day internationals between England and Pakistan were pre-empted when \"known corrupters\" were headed off at the pass and denied entry. Then in October a surprise victory for Kenya over India in a match in South Africa received close scrutiny, with betting patterns studied, but was put down to a quirk. Surprises do happen. Now, though, Condon suggests that, as far as it is possible, the game has been cleaned up for the first time in 20 years. \"I have no doubt that matches were still being fixed up until last April,\" he was reported as saying last week. \"But since then there have been none, though with the help of police and players we intercepted several attempts.\" If it sounds complacent, then it is not meant to be. The perfect crime, by definition, will not be detected but Condon feels that he and his unit have built up sufficient confidence, trust and perhaps fear that whistles would be blown soon enough on attempts at malpractice. \"People now realise we are for real and not just a cosmetic exercise,\" he continued. \"Anyone still involved in international cricket who is at it is going to be caught and dealt with.\" Already more pieces are being slotted into his preventive jigsaw with the appointment of dedicated ICC security managers as recommended in his interim report last year; five of them, in fact, one for every two Test playing countries. Such is the respect that the work of the unit has acquired over the past two years, it is believed that other sports are interested in trying to utilise its expertise. Condon was not interested in interviewing Cronje again. There was probably no more that could be added and, besides, Cronje had made only statements that amounted to an endorsement of evidence already gleaned. Rather, with him still under investigation for possible tax and corruption charges, Condon was intending to discuss with prosecutors in South Africa the possibility of an exchange of information with the admittedly unlikely prospect that he might have been extradited to India, where the match-fixing charges originated and where the case against Cronje has continued to be built brick by brick. Also on the agenda was to be a further attempt to trace any overseas accounts, particularly those in tax havens. This may be in response to the lingering doubts that Cronje, a self-confessed money-junkie, had sold himself for relatively paltry amounts. Ultimately he made more from television programmes produced in his home country and Australia than he said he did from his corrupt actions. Probably now we shall never know. Although the Indians plough on, investigations in South Africa by the director of public prosecutions, the elite anti-crime unit, the Scorpions, and the Inland Revenue have all officially been brought to a conclusion. If ranks closed in South Africa at the time of the original accusations, they did doubly so on Cronje's death. Thousands attended his funeral, friends and enemies alike. There has been a massive air of forgiveness. Though there was no surprise at the South African response, much of the reaction elsewhere seemed disproportionate and hypocritical. Nasser Hussain's statement on behalf of England, for example, made reference to Cronje's fine cricketing qualities and not a jot to the fact that it was he who had been inveigled into participating unknowingly in the most transparent of Cronje's illegal endeavours at Centurion when, with the series won, the South African captain declared on the last morning of the final Test and gave England an unreasonable chance of victory. Possibly Hussain did not pen it himself. Steve Waugh, too, talked only of a worthy opponent. There had been peripheral talk at Edgbaston of the England and Sri Lanka teams honouring the fellow with black armbands and a minute's silence. Fortunately the England and Wales Cricket Board, and one hopes the players as well, recognised the inappropriate nature of making such a gesture on an international cricket ground. Had that not been the case, incidentally, how many players, one wonders, would have refused to join in and how would they have been regarded? Cronje deserves our forgiveness just as anyone should in the fullness of time. A young life has been taken and that is a tragedy. But even if cricket pushed as far as it was able, he escaped the prosecution in the courts that was being demanded and the prison term that might have resulted. Dr Ali Bacher, former head of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, had what at first sight appeared to be the temerity to suggest that Cronje saved cricket. What he was driving at, of course, was the idea that his entrapment led to Condon and the sanitisation of the game. It is an angle certainly for, sadly, it needed a non-Asian to be exposed before the world would take notice. What we should never forget, however, is that, for all his angst and apologies, his religious beliefs and confessions, and the restructuring of his life, had Cronje not been nailed, he would still, in all probability, be defiling the game. \u00b7 Think of the fervour being generated by England's football World Cup progress, then double it and you will have some idea of what the game of rugby union means in New Zealand. When the All Blacks play, as they did on Saturday against Italy (they won 64-10), the world takes a back seat. When they lose it is a disaster. After they returned home having been beaten by France in the last rugby World Cup, their then coach John Hart had his racehorse booed and spat at during a meeting. The Super 12 season is awaited more keenly than any new football season here. Now I rather like the concept of Super 12. I'd even buy the idea of Super 14 or whatever number it was that the Australians, miffed by the fact that they have only three sides participating against the Kiwis' five and South Africans' four, proposed and had rejected. It is the notion of genuinely elite teams competing. I wish it could happen in our domestic cricket. The problem is that, though the prospect can excite, the reality is often a disappointment. Last winter the England cricket team were in Christchurch at the same time that the Canterbury Crusaders were beginning what was to prove an unbeaten year by taking on the Blues. I am a Blues fan, not just from youthful Saturdays in the Shed at Stamford Bridge but from time in Auckland. This was a chance not to be missed. It was a letdown of massive proportions. First old Lancaster Park, now referred to as Jade Stadium, has been massively redeveloped. That night it was packed, not a spare ticket to be had. Yet the whole thing was devoid of atmosphere or intimacy. Of the 35,000 in the ground, about 34,500 were Crusaders supporters. When the home side scored it was bedlam; when the Blues had the gall to reply, the silence was akin to Sachin Tendulkar being dismissed in a Bombay one-day international. So I have become a little disillusioned. The competition in general seems lopsided, with the South Africans hopeless. Play is like rugby league with flankers, some scores resemble basketball, and the deciding factor is usually a last-minute Andrew Mehrtens penalty. Still, my family like the shirts: Highlanders, Hurricanes, Chiefs, Crusaders and of course Blues. But watch out for Jade Stadium on July 13, when blood may be spilt. There was a long and acrimonious spat this year over the staging of the 2003 World Cup, originally planned as a joint Australian-Kiwi venture. Now Australia alone has it. But revenge is looming. There is no international sporting confrontation more fierce than Bledisloe Cup games between the All Blacks and the Wallabies. They hate each other with a passion. But the first of the series next month will carry extra venom. New Zealand dignity has been pricked. The first scrum will register on the Richter scale and the local A&amp;E wards are on red alert.
