But they won thanks to a goal by Mata and they are safely into the last eight of the Europa League, where no one will want to play them. And not many will want to watch them. 90+4 min: What a freekick! Noboa curled a beauty around the wall and towards the top corner. What a save! Romero acrobatically pushes it around the post! And on that note, the ref blows his whistle. United totter on! 90+4 min: A final chance for Rostov, as Jones is unfairly punished for a fair aerial challenge. The freekick is about 28 yards out, quite central ... 90+2 min: United are seeing this game out well, finishing on the attack. No sign of Rostov forcing extra-time at this rate. 90 min: Ibrahimovic receives the ball just outside the box and tricks his way past one opponent. He clearly figures he deserves a goal so ignores team-mates and tries to dance past a couple more opponents and get off a shot himself. But he\u2019s rumbled. 88 min: Bailly is down injured, clutching his shin after challenging Bukharov from behind. If that was a ploy to dupe the ref into thinking he hadn\u2019t committed a foul, it worked because United have been awarded the freekick. Bailly clambers back to his feet. 86 min: Bukharov booked for taking out Fellaini in midfield after a nifty drab-back by the Belgian. 84 min:I say, Jones is growing into this role! He skips past two players down the left wing, bringing giddy ol\u00e9s from the crowd before running out of play! That\u2019s the most fun we\u2019ve had all evening. 82 min: Fellaini, in the playmaker role, fires the ball wide to Jones, in the scorching left winger role. A Rostov counter-attack is born. 79 min: Fine save by Romero! From out of nothing Rostov nearly snatched an equaliser, Bukharov getting a crafty header to a clever ball from deeper. Romero showed great reactions to dive to his right and tip it around the post! 77 min: That last four minutes felt like hours. 73 min: Rostov still only need a goal to take this to extra-time. Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t get it because another 30 minutes of this dreary fare is no one\u2019s idea of showbiz. 71 min: Rashford was apparently about to replace Mata before that goal. He\u2019s been told to go sit down now. Mourinho, meanwhile, is standing on the sideline distributing bananas. Rojo chomps one down gratefully. Mourinho is blatantly trolling the yellow-clad visitors. United strike on the counter-attack. Mata started it by winning the ball in midfield. Mkhitaryan then fired a low cross in from the right. Ibrahimovic tried to flick it into the net from six yards but only managed to help it on to the back post, where Mata arrived to convert an easy tap-in. So it has come to pass: Rostov loosened up and United took advantage. Mourinho\u2019s masterplan bears fruit! 67 min: United have lapsed into ominous passivity, and Rostov are looking brighter. It really shouldn\u2019t have been this laborious for United. Are they going to be punished? 66 min: Rashford is one his feet on the sideline, seemingly getting instructions from the manager. \u201cKeep it tight\u201d, perhaps? 65 min: All told so far, this is a finely-poised, godawful game. 64 min: Nerves are a-jangling at Old Trafford as Rostov begin to rumble forward and cause a bit of bother. Bailly has just had to throw himself in front of a shot at the edge of the area, making a good block. United substitution: Jones on, Blind off. 61 min: Actually, it seems Joens will come on for Blind, who appears to have suffered a bash on the head and is unable to continue. Rostov substitution: Bukharov on, Azmoun on. Guess that means Rostov are going to try the aerial route. Mourinho seems to figure the same thing because he\u2019s just told Phil Jones to warm up. \u201cEven if no-one does ask you\u2019re quite right that it\u2019s been shoddy and shoddy again from Mourinho,\u201d seethes Geoff Wignall. \u201cIf Rostov could have chosen which sub to come on for Pogba, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d have gone for Fellaini too.\u201d 58 min: There\u2019s a lack of smoothness, speed and general derring-do from United. There\u2019s the occasional burst from them, but mostly they\u2019re serving up very lumpy porridge. 55 min: Herrera switches the play with a long crossfield pass to Valencia, who floats a cross from the right towards the penalty spot. Ibrahimovic nuts it over the bar. 52 min: Oh! Rostov have just mounted a dangerous counter-attack! And they darn near scored from it, too. Azmoun was the mischief-maker in chief, rolling the ball on to his left foot at the edge of the area and cracking a vicious curler towards the far corner. Romero flung himself to the right to make a decent save. 50 min: Blind goes on a gallop down the left, then curls a deep cross towards the Rostov penalty spot. Ibrahimovic gets a head to it, sending it more or less straight up into the air. He manages to collect it as it drops and offload to Mkhitaryan, who can\u2019t get a shot away from 10 yards because he\u2019s surrounded and pestered by four defenders. United are always far, far outnumbered in the opposing box. They\u2019re going to have to address that if they\u2019re to get the goals they need to stop worrying about an admittedly unlikely counter-attack by Rostov. United substitution: Fellaini on, Pogba off. 47 min: Rostov send a freekick into the United area. It\u2019s headed away. Pogba collects the bouncing ball just outside the box and flicks it over an opponent and sets off to retrieve it on the other side. And then he pulls up, wincing in pain! That looks like a hamstring pull. He can\u2019t continue and trudges off looking dismayed but, at least, not in extreme pain. Mourinho\u2019s decision is to replace him with Fellaini rather than Rashford. Shoddy again, if you ask me again. 46 min: No substitutions have been made by either manager. That\u2019s shoddy from Mourinho, if you ask me. \u201cAn American football coach once said that your record indicates who you are,\u201d lectures Michael Kamenitsky. \u201cTo say otherwise is just wishful thinking. So, if during the first 40-some matches your players have been bouncing the ball off the woodwork and missing wide and high on easy chances then that\u2019s who you are. To think otherwise might be insanity.\u201d United have dominated possession and fluffed a couple of clear chances but generally been frustrated by a well-organised and ultra-defensive Rostov side. They\u2019re going through as things stand but they\u2019d feel a lot more serene if they could get on the scoresheet. At some point Rostov will have to loosen up and go for a goal and that may be when United could strike. But they might do so sooner if they try to pull Rostov apart with some direct running and by sending more players into the box. Rashford needs to be on there, for starters. 45+1 min: Rojo\u2019s attempted shot from 35 yards falls to the feet of Ibrahimovic at the edge of the Rostov box. It runs away from the Swede to Pogba, who sets himself up for a shot with one slinky touch and then has a go from 20 yards. It\u2019s well struck but not quite well enough to beat Medvedev, who has time to move across goal to bat it away with both hands. 43 min: Erokhin has a shot from 30 yards. You\u2019ll not be reading about it in any match reports later. 42 min: United knock the ball around a bit ... and eventually work it to Bailly, who lofts it from his own half into the Rostov box. Easy fudge for the visitors, and a sign that United are running dry on ideas. Operation Frustration is working reasonably well for Rostov. But at some point they\u2019re going to have to come out of their shell and go looking for the goal they need. 40 min: Pogba hoofs the freekick high and wide. 39 min: Mata concedes a foul deep in Rostov territory, allowing the Russians to whack it out of there, at last. But it comes straight back. And within seconds Mata is fouled by Bamramyan in almost the same place where Rostov took the original freekick from. It\u2019s within shooting range ... 36 min: I think it\u2019s fair to say United don\u2019t need three centrebacks here. They could replace one of them with Carrick and gain more creativity and thrust while still allowing Valencia and Blind to charge forward. 34 min: Herrera clips a nice ball into the left-hand channel for Ibrahimovic to chase. The Swede does just that. There\u2019s a team-mates calling for a pass in the centre but Ibrahimovic instead turns on to his right foot and lets fly from the 15 yards. His ferocious shot whizzes past the keeper ... and crashes out off the far post! 31 min: I\u2019m pretty sure that Rostov know they need an away goal, but for now all they can do is mass around their box and try to keep United at bay, which they are generally doing quite well, in fairness. 28 min: Mkhitaryan is sent clear on goal and attempts to clip the boucning ball past the advancing keeper. But he misjudges his shot and sends it a couple of yards wide from the edge of the box. Oh Mhiky, you\u2019re not so fine! 26 min: The Old Trafford crowd, who had apparently been sleeping up till now, leap to their feet and howl for a penalty after Medvedev appears to push Mkhitaryan in the back to stop him from reaching the ball after a cross by Mata was deflected into the air by a defender. The keeper definitely put his hands on Mkhitaryan\u2019s back but Im not sure he applied much force. And I only think they were demanding a penalty, but they may just have had a bad dream. 24 min: United are finding it difficult to pick a way through Rostov\u2019s massed defence. But they have just won a corner, as Blind made a burst down the let and was almost found by Ibrahimovic, whose smart pass was diverted out for a corner by Noboa. 22 min: Mata cross from the left, almost by the corner flag. It should be easy pickings for the keeper, but for some reason Medvedev decides to punch it, and he;s no John Prescott. But he\u2019s lucky, as after his wafty slap the ball drops to one of his team-mates. 19 min: A bit of a magickus clumsicus at the moment, as Daniel Radcliffe might say. A scrappy spell, in more common parlance. 16 min: Mata chips a 30-yard pass over the Rostov defence. Medvedev hurtles out of his box to try to intercept it but Ibrahimovic gets to it first and nods it past the keeper. The Swede then retrieves the ball and manoeuvres himself into a shooting position, attempting to lob the ball over the backtracking defenders from a tight angle. It drops short. Worth nothing, by the way, that that counter-attack started when Pogba raced back to dispossess Azmoun, who was threatening to break towards the United area. 15 min: United seem to have found a decent rhythm and are stretching Rostov more and more. Valencia is causing lots of bother down the right and United are giving him good, swift service. 13 min: A fine, sweeping move by United. It was launched in midfield by Pogba, who fed Herrera, who pinged it wide to Valencia. He lashed in a fierce low cross from the right. But it was well defended by Rostov. 11 min: Valencia tears down the right and wins a corner as his cross id put behind by a defender. Mata takes it quick and short to Mkhitaryan and then receives a return pass and skitters into the area. But three defenders converge on him to stifle the danger. 9 min: Freekick to United after an attempted pass by Blind hits the arm of Terentyev, who could hardly get it out of the way. A harsh ruling by the ref. Ibrahimovic lets Rostov off by curling a weak freekick into the wall from 22 yards. 6 min: United are attempting to put Rostov back in their box in more ways than one. After the visitors\u2019 uppity start, the home team have taken control of the game and are forcing the Russians to retreat ever deeper. 4 min: Blind delivers an outswinging corner. Rojo eludes his marker and gets a firm header to it from nine yards. The keeper palms it up into the air and then makes another save when it drops to Ibrahimovic! 3 min: Pogba is making early efforts to run the game. He\u2019s loping hither and thither to demand the ball. And now he\u2019s won the first corner of the game ... 2 min: Rostov have made a composed start, easing themselves into the game with some zippy passing the United half. 1 min: We have kickoff! There are some people on the pitch \u2026 fortunately, it\u2019s the players and officials. United are in what we may call their traditional tabloid kit (red tops) while Rostov are in an all yellow number. The officials appear to have been hired from a local Catholic church, wearing all black clobber with round white collars. \u201cThe stadium announcer/DJ at the Besiktas \u2013 Olympiakos game just played Zorba The Greek when Besikats scored their fourth - ouch!\u201d yelps Pjotr van Rooijen. Mourinho has just been speaking to BT and confirmed that he\u2019s using a back three here. He also praised the grassy pitch, the weather and his opponents. Dear old Jose, always spreading good vibes. \u201cThe pitch is a good pitch. The weather is very nice for playing football, with a little bit of rain. But the pitch is better for both teams and they can play. They\u2019re playing with Azmoun and Poloz up front, who are both creative, fast and very dynamic.\u201d Besiktas - despite having a man sent off in the first half - have just gone 4-1 up against Olympiakos (5-2 on aggregate), so there\u2019s one potential opponents for the winners of the forthcoming bout at Old Trafford. Celta Vigo and Genk are looking like going through, too. Reckon the winners of the Roma-Lyon tie are the biggest threat to United (or Rostov), though. No doubt who the visitors\u2019 main danger man is today: Rostov\u2019s 22-year-old forward Sardar Azmoun is nicknamed the Iranian Messi. Or the Iranian Mahrez or the Iranian Ibrahimovic, depending on who you listen to. I\u2019ve even heard him called the Iranian Hoolahan, but that\u2019s probably hyperbole. Anyway, here he is showing sumptuous deftness when scoring for his country against South Korea. It looks like Mourinho has decided to go with a back three again. Meanwhile, his counterpart, Ivan Daniliants, seems to have only four available substitutes, according to the team sheet provided by Uefa. United: Romero; Bailly, Smalling, Rojo; Valencia, Pogba, Herrera, Mata, Blind; Mkhitaryan, Ibrahimovic Subs: De Gea, Jones, Lingard, Carrick, Young, Rashford, Fellaini Rostov: Medvedev; Bayramyan, Mevlja, Navas, Kudryashov, Terentyev; Noboa, Prepelita, Erokhin; Poloz, Azmoun Subs: Goshev, Kireev, Bukharov, Devic Referee: G Mazeika (LTU) Hello. Kindly leave your envy at the door and join us with pure hearts and minds to watch Manchester United\u2019s attempt to reach the last eight of the Europa League, which is as far as they have ever got in the continent\u2019s secondary competition. They are well placed to reach that landmark today, as they go into the home leg with a 1-1 away draw in their wallets while their opponents, who have yet to win on the road in Europe this season, have been shorn of three key players through suspension and injury (Vladimir Granat, Aleksandr Gatskan and Timofei Kalachev). Mind you, even if Rostov were at full-strength you\u2019d fancy United to give them what for at Old Trafford unless, of course, your judgement were twisted by jealousy of Paul Pogba\u2019s salary and cheery demeanour. In which case, thank goodness we have regular state of the nation addresses from Jose Mourinho to call people like you to rights. Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial are unavailable to Mourinho today but those absences should be trifles, as Mourinho can still deploy a team that should be capable of devouring these mid-ranking Russian visitors. Doing so with a bit of panache and some good old goals would go some small way towards reassuring fans that United are on the way to becoming the force that they should be. For the moment, there are still doubts about that even if they\u2019ve already won the first competition that they could have won under Mourinho. Adding the Europa League to their League Cup triumph would be splendid, both for the glory of winning a fine competition in its own right and for the fact that it would secure qualification for next season\u2019s Champions League, which United might not reach through the Premier League because it\u2019s the best in the world, as English clubs record in the Europa League clearly proves. Winning is the main aim of the game today but Mourinho told us in another of his recent homilies that victory alone is not enough at the Theatre of Dreams. So here we are now, United, entertain us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
