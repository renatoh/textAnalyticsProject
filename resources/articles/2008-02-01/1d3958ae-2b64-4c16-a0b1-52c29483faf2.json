The result from Anfield brought the fifth round of the FA Cup to life in the time-honoured manner and made the meeting between the top two clubs in the country look like a chapter of a longer narrative rather than a one-off, sudden-death tie. Rafael Benitez will be heavily criticised for rotating his squad, and with half-time still a distant prospect Arsene Wenger may also have been regretting his decision to give Mathieu Flamini a rest. The French midfielder, so vital to Arsenal's defensive shield this season, could only watch in horror from the bench as his team-mates committed error after error, both individual and collective, to present Manchester United with a three-goal lead at the interval. You could only feel sorry for Gilberto Silva, who returned to the side in Flamini's place. With Arsenal's young reserve full backs, Justin Hoyte and Armand Traore, proving alarmingly vulnerable every time United attacked the flanks, and William Gallas and Kolo Toure constantly bamboozled by the movement of Wayne Rooney, the Brazilian veteran could do little to hold the opposition at bay. But then he is hardly at a peak of match-fitness, having returned from leading Brazil to victory in last summer's Copa America only to discover that Wenger had developed a preference not just for William Gallas as the team's captain in succession to the departed Thierry Henry but for Flamini in the position that Gilberto had made his own over the past five seasons. For a 31-year-old of such distinction, this has been a disastrous season and there will no doubt be a move in the summer, probably to Italy. Anywhere would be a relief after such a conclusive defeat at United's hands, which will have done nothing to rekindle a desire to stay at a club where he is clearly seen as a peripheral player. Since his arrival in England after the 2002 World Cup he has personified a kind of quiet dignity not exactly superabundant in the Premier League, and it seems a shame that his time in English football should end with a sense of personal anti-climax. Arsenal's staggering incompetence in this match, surely the worst performance in Wenger's time at the club, was certainly the unhappiest of souvenirs. From front to back Arsenal were so poor that one could only question their commitment to the competition. On a day when they would have been beaten by Barnsley's youth team, they were taken apart by a United side happy to spurn enough chances to have gone into double figures and to start showboating with half an hour still to play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
