But yesterday Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse was unable to confirm reports that investigations had widened to include another northern-based trainer and jockey. \"Alan Berry, the trainer of Hillside Girl, and his staff have been questioned by the security department,\" said Maxse. \"And Betfair have cooperated fully with us, even though the race in question took place before the memorandum of understanding had been agreed to look into suspicious betting patterns.\" It has emerged that Steve O'Sullivan, a blacksmith employed by the Berry stable, was among those interviewed by the Jockey Club's security team. O'Sullivan allegedly lost more than \u00a3100,000 with Betfair when he laid - backed the horse to lose - another Berry runner, Nearly Before Time, only for the latter to win at 14-1. A week later, Hillside Girl was pulled up at Carlisle after she had drifted from a short price right out to 21-1 with Betfair in an 11-runner auction stakes for two-year-olds. The case was then referred to Jockey Club headquarters at Portman Square in London. Hillside Girl has since undergone surgery on her knees and her trainer Berry has insisted that he has no suspicions about anyone who works for him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
