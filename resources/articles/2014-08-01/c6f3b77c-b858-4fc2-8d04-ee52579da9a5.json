This concept double album of dances is not the world's most original idea, but the delivery is absolutely winning. Benjamin Grosvenor may take a slightly skittish approach to Bach, with some rhythmic quirks in the fourth partita's Aria, but once we are into Chopin he bowls you over with his flexibility and power: the Grande Polonaise Brillante is terrific (though why follow it with another polonaise?). The discovery is the Valses Po\u00e9ticos by Granados, done with total charm and dash. Even the trashy Schulz-Evler mash-up of Strauss's Blue Danube is transmuted by Grosvenor into something breathtaking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
