Most eye-catching in this front-page lineup was the \"former No 10 adviser\" Ros Altmann \u2013 a former aide to Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown as chancellor, now a governor at the London School of Economics \u2013 who seemed strangely incongruous among those backing the paper's \"decision to dump PM Gordon Brown and support David Cameron's Conservatives instead\". For sure, the economist has strong criticism of the pensions and economics polices pursued by Gordon. But there it ends. \"What I said to them in answer to the specific question: 'Do I now support the Tories?' was 'No',\" she tells us. \"I said I don't know what their policies are so I can't support them. I said I can understand that some people no longer support Labour. There has been a bit of poetic licence here.\" Such is war. We wrote this week of Peter Davies, the mayor of Doncaster, and his love of politically incorrect plain speaking. This makes him very popular with the rightwing bloggers. They are easily pleased. But we will not allow our focus on him to blind us to the virtues of other plain-speaking types who might also amass a following among the continually embittered. Fellows such as Keith Mitchell, the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire county council, who has boasted of \"making no attempt to hide some politically incorrect attitudes\". In this he is consistent. Approached by campaigners against an incinerator \u2013 folk supported by the likes of conservatives MPs Ed Vaizey and Tony Baldry \u2013 he said such discussions would be \"about as helpful as having a conversation with a blind, deaf mute \u2013 except the latter would probably try to understand what was being communicated to him\". The new politics. Coming soon. A frustrating week for Lord Mandelson, then, cut adrift by Murdoch, and more so because he has so far been unable to lay his hands on a present from fellow peer Norman Foster. A Freedom of Information query by Building Design magazine reveals that Norm, no doubt thankful for his firm's invitation to attend UK Trade &amp; Investment's business delegation to Iraq earlier this year \u2013 gave the most powerful man in Britain volumes one to four of the Norman Foster Works books, plus a Foster's catalogue. Alas, the combined cost of these is close to \u00a3300, well above the ministerial gifts limit of \u00a3140. If Mandy really wants to have his gift, he'll have to stump up some cash himself. He should probably move quickly, for these architectural types are prone to change their minds. Take Will Alsop. Just two months ago, he told how he had turned his back on architecture. It's all a bit too much, he said. From now on I'm going to paint. Well, that lasted about as long as Gordon's fightback because now Alsop has resurfaced as the London figurehead of Edinburgh-based firm RMJM under the name Will Alsop at RMJM \u2013 a bit like Gordon Ramsay at Claridges, or Heston Blumenthal at the Little Chef. Some say the painting thing was whitewash from the start \u2013 contractual tap dancing \u2013 and with Will one never knows. Still, it's better to have him around than not. Yes, it is a time for revival and who could fail to be heartened by the news that Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, has moved to restore the combative Bruce \"The Brute\" Anderson (pictured) to pride of place as a political columnist. Governments come and governments go but Bruce is a constant; imbibing prodigiously, making off with a five-figure advance and failing to deliver the book, falling headlong over security gates, that sort of thing. All we crave now is the full return of that other erstwhile Spectator fixture Paul \"Spanker\" Johnson, whose various interests supplied diaries past with so much material. The Speccie owes it to itself, and to us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
