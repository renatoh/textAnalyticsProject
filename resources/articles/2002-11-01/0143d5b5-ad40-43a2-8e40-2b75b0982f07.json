It's been a roller-coaster of a week emotionally. Everything has happened very quickly. I was first reserve, the call came, and then I was in the team, just like that. But after the Saracens game against Leicester a couple of weeks ago I felt that I had proved I was back to my previous level, without any problems. Coming from Leeds to join France last Sunday was difficult mentally: the defeat at Leeds was hard to take, and I had a painful little injury in my thigh which hurt all through the week, right up to the match against South Africa, when I got another big bruise in the same place. But I think I'll recover well, and will be able to face New Zealand on Saturday. One of the best things this week was getting a couple of messages from the former Saracens coach Francois Pienaar, just to say that he was happy I'm back, which touched me, because he's a guy I respect a great deal. After two years away, I had to get to know everything again: the team, some of the players, the system of playing, the national rugby centre in Marcoussis. There's no comparison with our old base at Clairefontaine, which we shared with the footballers: Marcoussis cost \u00a330m and is purpose-built, with covered pitches, recovery units - everything set up to make life for international rugby players as simple as possible. As for playing, during the first training session I didn't really know who to take on in some of the moves, but it all fell into place. The main change in France in the two years I've been away is that they have a stability about them which wasn't there before. The mentality of the team and the staff has moved on. Everything is 200% more professional - before it was more haphazard. Everyone's job is defined to the last millimetre. We use video replays on computers to see what we have to do. It's like a game of battleships. There was plenty of tension during the build-up before the game, because I knew that everyone was watching me, that people knew this was a turning point for me. There was a lot of media attention, a lot of autographs. Luckily, during the Marseillaise I was able to catch the eye of our press officer, Lionel. He's an old friend, a great guy, and he gave me a funny look that took the stress away. My only regret is that the injury in my thigh prevented me from being 100% during the game. The drop-goal just happened: I had no idea where it was going to go, I just kicked it and hoped. It's a little sign of destiny, that things may be going my way, but I pulled my thigh a bit more in the kick. It was just like the one against England in 1996, but this time because my leg hurt I wasn't able to put my tongue out and do a little dance. The downside was Werner Greeff's charge into me, which happened in the rhythm of the game but was still at least worth a penalty, even if not quite a yellow card. It left me with another bruise on a different part of my thigh, which is even bigger than the previous one. Still, my good friend Xavier Garbajosa came on to replace me and got revenge by burning him off later in the game. Physically I feel that I'm now back to what I was before the injury, so now I must set my sights on a place in the World Cup. There's a group of about 30 or 35 players in the France team now that will be whittled down to about 25 for the World Cup, where they will be rotated. Other players will come back from injuries, others will be taken out, but at least I'm able to cover several positions in the backs. It was a momentous weekend for me personally, but on a bigger scale it was significant for northern-hemisphere rugby. We've shown that we are all heading in the right direction, which can only rekindle interest in the World Cup. England had the potential to win by a lot more, until Jonah Lomu awoke and began his piano-moving act. I'd always rather play with Jonah than against him, so there may be a few sleepless nights before we play them on Saturday. Perhaps I'll have to try and strike a deal with him: a holiday in France if he runs at someone else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
