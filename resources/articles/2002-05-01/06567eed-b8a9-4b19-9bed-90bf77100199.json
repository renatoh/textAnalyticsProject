In the 80s and 90s I was involved myself in about \u00a31m worth of refurbishment of school buildings (under a Conservative government). Now, sadly, I am lucky if I am involved in a tenth of this amount. Yet school buildings are in need of spending running into millions if they are to look the part where teachers and children are pleased to walk in the door in the morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
