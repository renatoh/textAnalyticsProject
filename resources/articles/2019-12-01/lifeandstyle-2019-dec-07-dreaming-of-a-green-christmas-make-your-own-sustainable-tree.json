I don\u2019t want to add to that problem,\u201d she explains. Her work \u2013 which encompasses event styling, creative workshops and interior styling projects \u2013 wholeheartedly embraces the storied and the secondhand. So, when asked to create a sustainable tree, she immediately headed outside. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out foraging, there is often a story associated with the objects you find. You\u2019ll remember the walk you were on, the people with you, the light or the weather that day. Foraging makes something place-specific, and it\u2019s free!\u201d The branch that Bullivant has dressed was found in her friends\u2019 garden. It had fallen from an oak tree. \u201cIt is hard to find the perfect branch,\u201d she says. \u201cFor this, I was looking for one with a straight middle and an equal spread at the top, but nothing too perfect. I love that it still has a few oak leaves hanging on.\u201d It is held upright in a metal tree stand with screws, which is covered by a tree skirt, woven in willow. (\u201cNot everyone has time to forage \u2013 and not everyone will necessarily know what to do with the branch when they do,\u201d Bullivant admits. If that\u2019s the case, then she suggests a sustainable, shop-bought alternative, such as Branch, by the designer Demelza Hill.) The branch has been dressed with a combination of foraged posies and eco-friendly shop-bought decorations. Bullivant made the posies by gathering a mixture of fresh and dried foliage, including sprigs of box hedge, bronze-coloured bracken, dried seed heads, and spikes of rosemary or thyme. (\u201cNever uproot a plant, strip a bush, or take from public green spaces without permission,\u201d she advises.) These have been tied to the branch with ribbons supplied by Natural Dyeworks, a local small-batch company that creates natural dye from foraged ingredients such as nettle, madder root and alder cones. Bullivant suggests you approach your purchases with sustainability and longevity in mind. The decorations hung here are from makers who champion sustainability in all its forms. The white porcelain ornaments, stamped with objects found in nature, are from Aerende, an online \u201clife-improving\u201d homeware store that sells products crafted in the UK by people facing barriers to employment. The ornaments have been made by Studio 306 \u2013 a collective of skilled arts and craft practitioners working to aid mental health recovery through creativity. The glinting brass decorations and moon-shaped tree topper are from Workshop Ltd, a UK design duo who produce objects on demand from recycled, untreated brass, which will gain a patina over time. The hand-painted, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 baubles are made from recycled newspaper. \u201cThink of your ornaments as heirlooms to be passed down,\u201d Bullivant suggests. It\u2019s a philosophy that extends right the way to the bottom of the branch, where the gifts have been wrapped in material from Folds, a company that sells reusable organic cotton and certified linen gift wrap. \u201cA fragrant herb or slice of dried orange can be tucked into the gifts for a complete sensory, present-opening experience,\u201d adds Bullivant. hannahbullivant.com \u2018I want to make waste meaningful\u2019: Robi Walters, artist \u201cIf you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\u201d The artist Robi Walters lives by this maxim. For more than a decade, his practice has involved building up mesmerising collages from individual, hand-cut petals made from recycled card. The colours gently shift in tone and are shot through with flecks of neon or metallic. \u201cEven as a boy, I was inquisitive about discarded objects,\u201d Walters recalls. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to take things that were unwanted and make them beautiful, so that they become wanted. It has taken me years to discover that my art is really a reflection of my life story.\u201d His childhood was unsettled and, following a traumatic event, he was taken into care at five. That experience has shaped his award-winning art, which has also been informed by his daily meditation. \u201cThe shapes in my work are inspired by sacred geometry,\u201d Walters explains. \u201cThe shape of the petal is of two overlapping circles, which for me represents renewal or creation.\u201d By laying these petals one on top of the other, Walters achieves that elusive state of flow: \u201cI have to not think about what I\u2019m doing. As soon as I do, it becomes a struggle.\u201d The concept of creating a sustainable Christmas tree wasn\u2019t new to Walters. In the past, he has taken the trunks of discarded trees and sliced them into wooden discs, incorporating them into his art. For this structure, Walters asked friends and family to part with Christmas cards they\u2019ve held on to for years. \u201cI wanted these messages and sentiments to live on instead of being kept in a box,\u201d he says. These multiple seasonal greetings have been given new meaning in his gleaming collage, which Walters would like to see placed on display in a children\u2019s hospital. He has also made freestanding ornaments from simple painted wooden shapes from off-cuts of wood salvaged from a building site near his studio in Soho, central London. Walters sat with his daughter to paint the small shapes and crafted the neon paper chain from strips of spray-painted Observer Magazine pages. \u201cI want to make waste beautiful in a simple, meaningful way,\u201d he explains. \u201cGetting the next generation involved is a big part of that. If I can inspire those who see my art to create something similar \u2013 to look at their rubbish in a new light \u2013 then that is fantastic.\u201d Robi Walters is the artist in residence at Aston Martin.

She is moving on to a 35ft houseboat and her collapsible Christmas tree is coming with her. \u201cIt hangs, so it\u2019s a brilliant space-saver, and it will move around as the boat bobs on the water,\u201d she says. Potter\u2019s sustainable tree is made from easily accessible materials (what hasn\u2019t been found has been bought cheaply from a local hardware store). The base of the structure is an old aluminium bike wheel with its spokes removed. Chains have been screwed inside the spoke holes to form a pyramid structure that is hung from a central carabiner. Tensioning wire has then been threaded around the chains. The jade-coloured fronds of the tree are made from salvaged ghost gear \u2013 abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets that wash up on shorelines around the UK. Potter runs a circular-economy design studio in Hove, East Sussex. \u201cEverything we do is regenerative by design,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe try to utilise waste streams in our design processes, so this tree design represents exactly the sort of project we do. It also ties in with our specialism \u2013 marine plastics \u2013 and the voluntary work I\u2019m part of.\u201d Potter founded the Plastic Free Pledge campaign in 2016, which has since grown into a global movement. She is a voluntary representative for Surfers Against Sewage, and leads regular beach cleans in Brighton. She is also a member of the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI), which strives to reduce the 640,000 tonnes of fishing gear discarded in the sea each year. \u201cGhost gear is called ghost gear because it carries on fishing throughout its life, which is upwards of 600 years.\u201d The trawl nets that wash up on our shores are made from polypropylene or polyethylene, and the latter is not currently recyclable in the UK. \u201cOn beach cleans, the litter you find \u2013 glass, cans, some plastics \u2013 can quite often be recycled,\u201d says Potter. \u201cBut fishing net has no outlet whatsoever: it has zero value to the fishers and it actually costs them money to get rid of it.\u201d Through the government-funded Project: Net Worth, Potter has developed products that can be made from melted, injection-moulded ghost gear, such as an incredibly robust cabinet handle. \u201cIt looks like malachite or jade and it will last pretty much for ever. The idea is to show how the material could be used and to actually increase its value. It\u2019s about thinking innovatively and finding ways to lock up that material for as long as possible.\u201d clairepotterdesign.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
