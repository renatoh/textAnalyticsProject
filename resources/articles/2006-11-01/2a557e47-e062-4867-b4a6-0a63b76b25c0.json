Despite the margin of victory in this ultimately curious match, the Parkhead side's struggles were the result of frequently admirable play by Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Until Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and substitute Jiri Jarosik made late additions to Darren Dods' own goal, the home side had encountered serious and lasting difficulty in asserting themselves. Unlike the majority of visitors, Thistle seem to regard an outing here as an invitation to demonstrate their commitment to open, aggressive football, stimulated rather than intimidated by the occasion. Matching Celtic's 4-4-2 formation was no mere tokenism, Charlie Christie's well-drilled players clearly briefed by their manager to spread alarm among the home defenders - and the supporters massed in the stands - at every opportunity. It was a sound strategy, as it presented the champions with problems to which they are wholly unaccustomed in domestic matches on their own turf. More used to concern that his defenders could lose concentration through idleness, Gordon Strachan was at least relieved of that by the regularity with which the team from the Highlands put Artur Boruc and the others to the test. Even if Celtic made a bright and promising but unproductive start, with some quick movement and accurate passing, it was Thistle who should have taken the lead after 27 minutes of balanced jousting. A corner from the left was slung to the far side of the Celtic penalty area and headed back into the middle. Graham Bayne may have been surprised that the ball reached him without interception from a Celtic player, but he hurried his unchallenged header wide of Boruc's right post from only eight yards. This and other threats to the home goal would deepen the sense of injustice that would pervade the visitors when Dods inadvertently gave Celtic the lead shortly before half time. It could hardly be called outrageous fortune, however, as Celtic had played well enough. Lee Naylor began the move towards ascendancy with a high cross from the left that found Maciej Zurawski beyond the far post. The striker's header across the six-yard box would probably have been prodded over the line by Vennegoor of Hesselink had not Dods won the photo finish in that particular race. Celtic could have had two penalties, one on either side of the interval, as a result of contentious handling incidents. Grant Munro was followed by Dods, each almost certainly relieved by referee Kenny Clark's judgment of the 'offences' to be accidental. On another day, they might have been penalised. But the ultimate punishment would be inflicted later by Vennegoor of Hesselink, the towering Holland striker this time requiring no assistance from Dods to make the scoring credits. It must be said, though, that the unfortunate Inverness defender seemed to mistime his attempt to cut out Paul Telfer's cross from the right, allowing Vennegoor of Hesselink to step forward and sweep the ball right-footed low to the right of Michael Fraser from about 10 yards. The extension of the lead allowed Strachan to remove Thomas Gravesen - almost certainly with Tuesday's Champions League match against Manchester United in mind - and replace him with Jiri Jarosik. The Celtic manager had been forced to make a change earlier, for considerably less pleasing reasons. Gary Caldwell failed to regain his feet after going down in an accidental collision with Bayne and, after an attempt to treat the problem, the defender was helped off and replaced by Darren O'Dea. Caldwell's possible absence from the European match - it would be a definite setback - will cause Strachan as much concern over the next 48 hours as Inverness did. But Jarosik arrived in time to meet Shaun Maloney's corner from the right and send a header from 12 yards looping high to the right of Fraser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
