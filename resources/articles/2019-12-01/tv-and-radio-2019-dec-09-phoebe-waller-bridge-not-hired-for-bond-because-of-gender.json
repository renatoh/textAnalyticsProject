The Fleabag creator said it was \u201cmad\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d to work on No Time to Die, in which Daniel Craig will play 007 for the final time. But there was never a conversation about her being there to help with the film\u2019s female characters. \u201cIt was a really mad job to get,\u201d she told an audience at the Southbank Centre in London. \u201cI actually said to my producer once while we were making Fleabag that would be a cool thing to do one day \u2026 and then it was only a month later.\u201d Waller-Bridge was being interviewed by Deborah Frances-White, the comedian and writer best known for her podcast, The Guilty Feminist. Frances-White said she could not think of another woman being asked to work on a Bond script. \u201cI think the very first Bond film there was, but not since,\u201d Waller-Bridge said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t really come into the conversation. That\u2019s only really the press that have made that thing, in terms of me being a woman, you can see it is a button-pressing thing. \u201cThe reality was I got a call from Barbara [Broccoli, the film\u2019s producer] and Daniel saying, \u2018We like your work, can you come in and help us?\u2019. There wasn\u2019t ever really a conversation about can you come in and help us with \u2018the ladies\u2019. \u201cThey are proper, amazing producers and writers and actors and suddenly they are reduced to those people? \u201cThey said, \u2018It will be your take, can you come aboard and help us polish the script?\u2019 The characters were there, the story was there, it was just really exciting to be a part of it. There was a bunch of writers, I was a small contribution to this thing.\u201d Asked if audiences would recognise the lines she wrote, she said: \u201cI have no idea. I left long before it had finished filming and they are rewriting all the time, so \u2026 I hope so.\u201d Before Waller-Bridge, the only woman with a Bond writing credit was Johanna Harwood on Dr No (1962) and From Russia With Love (1963). Waller-Bridge was speaking at an event celebrating the publication of Fleabag: The Scriptures, and much of the conversation dug deep into this year\u2019s rapturously received second and final season of the BBC show. It will be remembered by many for the \u201chot priest\u201d character played by Andrew Scott. Waller-Bridge revealed that she spent a long time talking to a real priest, a monk called Fr William, as she prepared to write the series. \u201cHe was a huge part of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to talk to a priest who would talk to me openly and with candour about celibacy and about what happens when you\u2019re tempted, what goes through your head as well as the choices that you make. \u201cFather William was just an open-hearted, brilliant, brilliant man who had found faith later on in his life, who spoke about it openly and was incredibly inspiring and really gave me a new perspective on why people reach for certain things in their lives. He was just so open. We had long Skype sessions.\u201d Despite her fame as a result of Fleabag, Waller-Bridge could still travel on the tube, she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really care that much. On the tube people don\u2019t really look at other people and even if they do they don\u2019t care.\u201d Fortunately, Fleabag fans \u201care the most polite fans\u201d. She did not get the \u201cyou\u2019re mine!\u201d experience. Instead \u201cI always have \u2018sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry, so sorry \u2026 I don\u2019t want anything, I just want to say \u2026 goodbye, thank you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
