Man City are the League Cup winners, but we\u2019ll all have an opinion on what happened at the end there. Thanks for sending so many of yours in, throughout the afternoon, and sorry I couldn\u2019t get through them all. Thanks for your company \u2013 and stay close to the site over the next few hours as we\u2019ll have all the best reaction from Wembley. SARRI IS HERE: \u201cI think we have to talk about football because we played a very good match. In that situation it was a misunderstanding, I heard there was a problem and we needed to change it. I realised the situation only when the doctor arrived on the bench after some minutes. It was a misunderstanding, I understood the goalkeeper had cramp and would be unable to go to the penalties. \u201cI needed only to return, to be quiet I think [on his near-walkout]. As I say, I asked for a change for this physical problem and he said he hadn\u2019t a physical problem. So he was right I think. I have to talk with [Kepa] but only to clarify because now I have understood very well the situation. \u201cI am very happy here. I think in the last three matches we have improved a lot. Today we showed we could become a very solid team. We conceded nothing to the opponents and against Man City that is not easy. I am very proud of my players.\u201d He\u2019s played it down a treat there \u2013 whatever the truth ... Agnello Figueiredo writes: \u201cIt was all simple, really. Sarri had to just call Kepa over to the sidelines and talk to him. That way we wouldn\u2019t be here debating whether Kepa knew, or knew not, what the bench really meant. But I guess it\u2019s easy to talk when you\u2019re not in the heat and dust of battle.\u201d I think your last sentence may be the key there. Things were moving quickly and \u2013 this is important I think \u2013 Moss was also pressing Sarri for a resolution. Ah, some very nice clarity from Ben Mabley on that Les Sealey incident: \u201cLes Sealey did get a massive gash on his leg in the 1991 Rumbelows Cup final against Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 so bad, in fact, that he collapsed at Heathrow later due an infection in the wound. He was told that had he made the flight as planned, he could well have lost his leg. \u201cHe angrily (and famously) remonstrated with the physio Jim McGregor at the suggestion he should be subbed off, justifying this later with the point that there were no substitute goalkeepers at the time (they only came in just over a year later, from 1992/93) so an outfield player would have had to go in goal. He wanted to stay on, avoid that situation, and help Manchester United win. United lost the game 1-0.\u201d Azpilicueta speaks: \u201cWe knew we had to fight very hard to have a chance to win the trophy. We are obviously disappointed, we were a few centimetres from being the champions, but it was not the case so now we have to recover.\u201d On Kepa/Sarri: \u201cHonestly I don\u2019t know, I was on the other side of the pitch so I cannot comment.\u201d Spoken like a true pro. Another question: what else could Sarri have done, in those circumstances? Matthew Pearson sends in his \u2013 laudably nuanced \u2013 take: \u201cKepa thought it was all about whether he was injured or not. Sarri didn\u2019t, and made his decision. Kepa kept doing the thumbs up \u2013 universal footballer language for \u2018I\u2019m fine, move on\u2019. Sarri, sensing it had gone on too long, backed down. Headlines will mention his price tag and say he was acting too big for his gloves. But he\u2019s a young man who is used to gesturing to the bench and saying he\u2019s fine and that being enough. I feel sorry for Sarri, but Kepa was awake during a nightmare situation and him holding his nerve isn\u2019t a show of disrespect. Sarri backing down isn\u2019t a sign of weakness.\u201d Just seen replays of Sarri\u2019s furious reaction when it was clear he wasn\u2019t going to get his way. He was apoplectic ... Don\u2019t miss this \u2013 it\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report from Wembley! That\u2019s the generous interpretation and it might end up being the right one \u2013 but everyone\u2019s body language suggested there was more to it. \u201cBomb Kepa out in the summer and sign a replacem ... oh,\u201d writes Ian Sargeant, in some very nifty transfer embargo banter. \u201cSarri wasn\u2019t on his own. His staff including Zola, who was in the dugout, was just as angry/shocked as he,\u201d says Ruth Purdue. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, it was hard to catch everything that was going on. Can\u2019t wait to hear what he has to say ... Colm writes: \u201cEasy to be critical of Kepa, and clearly his behaviour is appalling, but as a Chelsea fan I\u2019m much more disappointed with the senior players/dressing room leaders \u2013 David Luiz, Rudiger and Azpi should have all been over, marching him off the pitch. Disrespect from the entire team.\u201d Jill O\u2019Donnell wrote in with a similar point. Sarri did seem to be all on his own there. Telling? Guardiola speaks: \u201cI\u2019m happy. Chelsea did an incredible performance. In the penalties anything could happen and we\u2019re lucky. I\u2019m happy to win back to back in this competition. I don\u2019t know if you realise the quality of the players Chelsea have. We knew it\u2019d be more difficult, a final. Many players are injured \u2013 Laporte, Fernandinho \u2013 but it\u2019s better to win the game. We\u2019ll see how far we can go.\u201d Did Kepa think Sarri just thought he was injured? Had Sarri just decided to bring on Caballero regardless for the penalties? We don\u2019t know the answers yet. Sally Officer writes: \u201cKepa should be told to pack his gloves and go. Player power gone mad!\u201d Sam Trenery says: \u201cUtterly despicable behaviour from Kepa. I\u2019m no Chelsea fan, or Sarri fan really, but if he\u2019s sacked now I have a lot of sympathy. Utterly pathetic for a player, any player, to put his own glory before that of the team \u2013 especially the goalkeeper going into a penalty shootout!\u201d My mailbag is bursting at the moment and I\u2019d say the weight of sympathy is heavily in Sarri\u2019s favour. David Wall writes: \u201cOn the radio they\u2019re talking about how this would never have happened to a more authoritative manager such as Clough or Ferguson, but didn\u2019t Les Sealey refuse to be substituted in a cup final after getting a huge gash in his knee (was it the Rumbelows Cup final that they lost to Sheffield Wednesday?\u201d Hmmm, rings a bell but I was very small then. Anybody remember clearly? Player power lives long! City lift the trophy, in the meantime, and cavort accordingly. They\u2019ve now won it four times in six years and, while they really didn\u2019t play that well today, they\u2019re thrilled to have this under their belt. Ruth Purdue writes: \u201cKepa is a disgrace. No excuses should be given to him. If Sarri gets sacked after this, he can keep his head high.\u201d Sarri can be famously blunt so you\u2019d assume that, a little later, he will tell those assembled in the press conference exactly how he perceives the Kepa incident. What do we think on that, by the way? Could Sarri have done anything more? Was it a bad reflection on his management, the player, both? Is it another big step towards the exit door? Sterling speaks: \u201c[Pep] said he didn\u2019t watch [the penalty[ and said where did it go. I said top bins. We kept focused and did the job. One trophy down, we just need to keep winning games and that\u2019s it.\u201d Well, well ... errr ... well. City retain a major trophy for the first time and the celebrations are really kicking in out there. What of Chelsea? You\u2019d have to say they were very good for most of that, the game went as Sarri planned. That is until the final moments of extra-time, when Kepa appeared to humiliate him by plain refusing to go off. He saved a penalty after that, but did it cost them? Bang! Into the top corner and they win 4-3 on penalties! HAZARD ... SCORES! Blimey, he floats a Panenka! 3-3. Sterling to win it ... Bernardo Silva ... SCORES! Down the middle. 3-2 City after four apiece. They\u2019re close. Hazard must score ... David Luiz ... HITS THE POST! 2-2. Sane ... MISSES! Kepa parries to his right and perhaps he\u2019s about to be vindicated, sort of! 2-2 after three apiece. Emerson ... SCORES! Well taken, with power, via Ederson\u2019s hand. 2-2. Aguero ... SCORES! It squirms under Kepa, who really should save it after getting there. My word. 2-1 City after two apiece. Azpilicueta ... SCORES! Nicely into the top corner. 1-1. Gundogan ... SCORES! Kepa is sent the wrong way. 1-0 City after one apiece. Jorginho ... MISSES! Ederson saves a weak, low penalty after a weird skip and jump from the Chelsea man. The penalties will begin imminently. Kepa will keep goal for Chelsea. We shoot towards the Chelsea end, and Chelsea go first. Kepa might well have felt better but did he not consider that ... hey ... Caballero might just be better at saving penalties and that this is a team game? He needs to be the hero now. A penny for Sarri\u2019s thoughts ... at one point he seemed set to walk out of the stadium! Extraordinary scenes at the end there. Kepa would not budge! That is humiliating for Sarri, surely. 120+3 min: We will be hearing a lot more about what we\u2019ve just seen, I can guarantee that. Absolutely surreal. Caballero is sitting down shaking his head. Sarri looks lost. It\u2019s as if a whole afternoon\u2019s restorative work might be undone. 120+1 min: Moss is talking to Sarri. Is this change happening or not? Kepa has overruled his own manager and will stay on the pitch \u2013 this is absolutely ridiculous. Sarri has walked out away from the bench and looks utterly perplexed. I have no idea what we are watching. Who is in control, exactly? 120 min: Kepa wants to stay on. Caballero wants to come on. Sarri wants to bring Caballero on. Kepa is yelling at Sarri, he doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere. What on earth is going on here? Kepa is basically standing his ground here, he wants to be the hero! This is crazy. 118 min: From that, Kepa is down with cramp. I wonder if this is a perfect juncture to bring on Caballero, who likes a shoot-out \u2013 as we saw in the 2016 final ... 117 min: A dangerous Hudson-Odoi run and cross causes brief trouble ... but City break and Rudiger makes a rare stumble, almost allowing Sane through! He recovers but the ball is still worked to Aguero, who cracks in a shot that Kepa gathers at the second attempt! 116 min: Think we\u2019d all like penalties now just for the sight of a net (presumably) rippling, wouldn\u2019t we? 114 min: Now Chelsea have some nice possession, and City let them build, but Azpilicueta is less effective here and his cross floats behind. 110 min: Close, and probably as close as City have come! Sterling zooms electrically to the line, right next to the posts, and squares for Aguero to tap in, surely. But Azpilicueta defends brilliantly, getting enough of a touch to divert the ball onto Kepa rather than into the net. The ball stays alive but Chelsea, eventually, survive! 108 min: Zinchenko\u2019s cross is blocked for a City corner. Gundogan\u2019s delivery is overhit and awful. It\u2019s been a theme today. Can someone, anyone, score ... a goal? Worth a reminder with the stress upon Sarri likely to be high at this stage. This, incidentally, is one of the best games I\u2019ve seen Rudiger play for Chelsea. He\u2019s been an absolute rock. As you were. And as you will be in a quarter of an hour, unless something surprising comes to pass. 103 min: Hazard now goes high, wide and fairly hideous from similar range. 101 min: Jorginho, in the meantime, wafts an effort wide from 25 yards and Chelsea continue to look slightly the more likely. 101 min: I genuinely don\u2019t think Manchester City have had a decent chance to score in this game. Can you remember one? 98 min: Chelsea have a corner, won by Hudson-Odoi, after a nice run and switch from Higuain. He\u2019s added some presence for them in a key area. Hazard\u2019s cross is dealt with but Chelsea keep up the pressure and Hazard gets another chance, this time on the volley, to serve up some trouble. Ederson gathers, though, with Rudiger lurking. 96 min: Now then \u2013 here comes Higuain, in place of Willian. Chelsea have some real firepower on there now! 94 min: Gundogan takes aim from 25 yards and everybody, bar Chelsea\u2019s players, staff and fans, wishes he hadn\u2019t. 93 min: Will this be one of those ultra-cagey extra time periods or will tired legs tell and chances flow? Nothing has happened yet, if you wanted an early steer. Chelsea have as good a chance of winning this as City. Another City change \u2013 Danilo for Fernandinho. Fair play, that was a very good second half from Chelsea in all departments and they might even have sneaked it. We get another 30! 90+4 min: Loftus-Cheek brings the ball down *beautifully* and sends Hazard scampering clear! But he\u2019s ... oooh ... a fraction offside. I think he was level with Zinchenko \u2013 that would have been a clear chance to win it! 90+3 min: City get that away, via good defending from Zinchenko and Kompany. 90+2 min: Otamendi is the latest to decide a yellow card is better than being left on his own backside, scything Hazard down on the left. David Luiz gees the Chelsea fans up as they await another well-placed set piece. Willian whips it under the bar, and Ederson has to touch it behind for a corner! 90+1 min: Four added minutes to avoid extra time ... 88 min: City, though, weather the mini-storm and tear upfield, Jorginho taking a booking with a very necessary foul on Sterling. Loftus-Cheek now replaces Barkley for Chelsea. 87 min: That\u2019s some lovely skill from Hudson-Odoi on the touchline and a very unlovely foul from Zinchenko to stop him making ground. Chelsea have free-kick, from which they manage a fair spell of pressure, ending with a Hudson-Odoi centre that is desperately cleared away. 86 min: Here comes Leroy Sane \u2013 replacing De Bruyne, who just hasn\u2019t got going today. Can Sane turn this for City at the death, as he did at Schalke on Wednesday? 85 min: Hudson-Odoi looks lively so far, but hasn\u2019t managed to get away into any space yet. Chelsea are giving as good as they get as we enter the last five minutes of normal time. 83 min: Kante has, along with Hazard, had a fine second half. Might have scored though! 81 min: The fire of five, ten minutes ago has dulled a bit. I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t get an extra 30. 79 min: Gundogan replaces the quiet David Silva. And Hudson-Odoi, to huge cheers, replaces Pedro. Can he produce something magical? 76 min: Another Chelsea chance! Hazard, who has been brilliant since half-time, lays Pedro into space on the right of the area, but instead of going for goal \u2013 as he\u2019d have been entitled to do \u2013 he looks to square back to the Belgian, only for Zinchenko to intervene just in time. A corner results but City clear. It feels like a final now, this. 73 min: ... and it\u2019s wasted badly. The shot flies way off. De Bruyne is yet to fire today. 73 min: A blistering City counter, of the kind they\u2019ve rarely been afforded, sees Chelsea resort to desperate measures. Willian bundles De Bruyne over but advantage is played \u2013 until Rudiger, who is booked, desperately fouls Bernardo Silva 22 yards out. It\u2019s a chance for De Bruyne to shoot ... 71 min: Now Barkley, teed up by Willian, floats one over. I\u2019d go as far as saying that Chelsea, when they do attack, look the more dangerous team. 69 min: Walker makes inroads into the box but can\u2019t get a shot off. A bit of a raised-stakes feel to this now \u2013 it\u2019s got a little frantic, hopefully in a good way. 67 min: Closest yet \u2013 and it\u2019s a big chance for Chelsea! Hazard makes another of those runs into space down the left, a bit wider this time, and beats Kompany with an ease that will encourage Chelsea greatly. He gets to the byline, lays back, and Kante is running in 12 yards out ... but smashes over! It could, perhaps should, be 1-0 to Sarri\u2019s men. 64 min: City passing, passing, passing but doing little, little, little to suggest we aren\u2019t heading for extra time. Hello Jose. 61 min: Some lovely, waifish play from Bernardo Silva down the right brings a cross, but Rudiger heads away. Still no real sign of a big chance, even if the game has a little more to it now. 59 min: Fernandinho is booked for a foul and it\u2019s a nice, central set-piece for Chelsea, who might just have arrived at this game now. It\u2019s ludicrously far out for a shot ... but that doesn\u2019t deter David Luiz, whose powerful-sidefoot schtick goes wrong here and sees the ball fly way, way behind. 57 min: Corner to City. It\u2019s a better start to this half. It bounces around the area and falls to Aguero, who controls a mishit Otamendi shot and finishes coolly! But he\u2019s half a foot offside \u2013 a decision confirmed after a lengthy VAR delay in which you wondered, for a split second, whether the goal might actually be given. 53 min: Oooh, Hazard has open grass to run into down the left \u2013 there\u2019s one of those spaces! At his best he might just streak away, jink into the box and finish ... but, after he gets inside the area, he seems to lose some confidence and stalls, checking back and allowing Otamendi to rob him. Not an unreasonable reading. 50 min: Kepa fumbles a fairly standard De Bruyne cross and is lucky that Aguero has already run ahead of the ball. 48 min: \u201cI hope John Terry has his kit on just in case Chelsea win this,\u201d quips Ally. He\u2019s in the Sky studio and has already slipped a few \u201cwe\u201d in. Meanwhile De Bruyne delivers a dangerous ball from the right and, eventually, Fernandinho fires well over from range. 47 min: Pedro immediately makes a nice run down the right, is felled, and wins Chelsea a chance to load the box. Willian delivers into what is actually a very good area in the Corridor Of Uncertainty, but they clear didn\u2019t load the box well enough because nobody attacks it. A goal? A chance? Something? Manchester City substitution: Kompany for Laporte (hamstring). Shouldn\u2019t change much ... should it? Don\u2019t forget that if it\u2019s still like this in around 50 minutes\u2019 time, we will have extra-time. If that\u2019s to be the case, let\u2019s hope it has at least opened up a bit by then. Chucky writes: \u201cHow many 0-0s is that from the top clubs this week across comps? Too many defensive coaches! Boring as.\u201d I think Jonathan Wilson had a point here. The pendulum always swings. Regarding that question on London clubs at Wembley, Phil West has crunched some of the numbers so the rest of us didn\u2019t have to: \u201cSince 1900 (according to Wiki) London clubs playing non-London clubs in the FA Cup final are 28-14 ahead. There are also a few occasions where two London teams were involved, but I ignored them. I\u2019m not sure if this means anything though \u2013 as years ago it was quite common for less successful teams to have a cup run only to lose in the final. Comparing results since the year 2007 gives a 6-2 score in favour of London teams.\u201d Nobody would say this has been much good. But, in fairness to Chelsea, it\u2019s probably gone as Sarri intended. They have kept City at arm\u2019s length and limited them to half-chances at best. 45+2 min: Almost severe embarrassment for Otamendi as he heads a Chelsea free-kick towards his own goal, with no opposition player near, and sees it fly only narrowly wide as Ederson dives desperately! So Chelsea have a corner with the half\u2019s last action, but it causes no danger. 45 min: First real bit of spark from Hazard, who does well to outdo Laporte but then, with men arriving very late in support, tries to do a bit too much in a tight space and sees City eventually block his attempt on goal. 43 min: Another City corner, now, and they\u2019re applying some real pressure again. David Luiz beats Laporte to it, but that\u2019s not the end of the story. Zinchenko plays the ball in again and Otamendi \u2013 ghosting in at the back post as a minute previously \u2013 gets a toe to the ball but not with enough power to beat Kepa. 42 min: Willian concedes a free-kick on the right after Chelsea lose the ball in their own half three times in quick succession while passing out aimlessly in pursuit of nothing. It\u2019s another very dangerous area. De Bruyne\u2019s cross again goes beyond everybody but Sterling, delivering from the left, sees his ball kept alive acrobatically by Otemendi at the far post. It looks good, but Chelsea clear. 39 min: De Bruyne, with a smart touch past David Luiz, reaches the byline but overhits his cross. Sterling, on the other side, twists Azpilicueta about sublimely at first but eventually runs out of space and Chelsea earn a goal kick. 37 min: It really has been low on excitement so far, let\u2019s be honest. Sarri has gone for Get A Result And Save My Job tactics, and I\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest they don\u2019t have a chance of squeaking it out that way. City aren\u2019t moving the ball as they can and chances aren\u2019t really coming. 34 min: It\u2019s not much but we are seeing a bit more from Chelsea now. Kante tries to get away down the right but can\u2019t reach it. City still have the initiative though and force an awkward hack away from Rudiger just outside the six-yard box. 32 min: Chelsea enjoy a little play around the City box, now, and Fernandinho has to be well positioned to stop Hazard latching onto a floated Jorginho ball into the area. 31 min: ... which is delivered by De Bruyne, who has been quiet so far, but Chelsea cope just fine. 30 min: That\u2019s a deserved yellow card for David Luiz, who agriculturally dumps Bernardo Silva over as the City man wriggles deftly away from him near the right byline. Dangerous free-kick here ... 28 min: A shot on target from Aguero, who links with David Silva before firing one from 20 yards, slightly deflected, that Kepa dives onto and holds. So, in fairness, it\u2019s going as Sarri probably hoped. 26 min: But now Chelsea do have an attack, sweeping upfield adroitly, and earn a free-kick midway inside the City half, a little to the right. It\u2019s their first real chance to put some pressure on. Willian arrows it to the back stick, Pedro heads down but nobody is poised to latch onto it. 25 min: If you were Hazard you\u2019d probably rather be in Madrid than chasing waste paper like this. 22 min: Best bit of action so far \u2013 Bernardo Silva floats a lovely right-to-left ball over Azpilicueta and Aguero, deep inside the box, chests down and sets himself before lashing over from an awkward angle. 21 min: Little comes of it. But it\u2019s only City doing any attacking. We\u2019ve not seen Hazard at all yet! 20 min: Maybe possession from the back will die and football will evolve to the extent that, in five years\u2019 time, everyone is playing percentage football and the real heroes are a generation of miniature Dave Bassetts. While we ponder that, Rudiger defends well from a dangerous Bernardo Silva ball and it\u2019s another City corner. 18 min: Some fairly heavy City pressure, now, but Luiz clears two crosses from the left. Chelsea are sitting off until City get 15 yards into their half. 17 min: Kepa looks dodgy with the ball at his feet so far, which doesn\u2019t help the previous point. 16 min: The thing is that Chelsea *insist* on passing the ball around from the back even though there are no options to progress the move and City keep pressing them aggressively. So the ball gets given away every single time. I know it\u2019s the way everyone has to play now but it so often becomes frayed and useless. You\u2019re probably not going to score the perfect goal from there, guys, so why not do it as and when? 13 min: Laporte feeds David Silva in a nice little pocket of space but his touch uncharacteristically lets him down. It\u2019s been a reasonably drab start, overall. 12 min: JR in Illinois is frothing \u2013 \u201cHave you re-watched what Jorginho did to Aguero in the first second of the game? It was not a \u2018stray arm\u2019 by Jorginho. It was a deliberate elbow aimed squarely at Aguero\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t make a clean connection, just a glancing blow, but it was as clear a red card offence as you\u2019d want to see. And Moss was standing five feet away. Unbelievable.\u201d I\u2019ll have to watch again at half-time. It would \u2013 and seemingly should \u2013 have been pretty much the quickest red card in history! 10 min: Fairly clear, now, that Chelsea are taking the conservative approach. But they cause a flutter now as a long switch from Emerson beats a badly positioned Laporte and almost sends Kante running clear. He is blocked off, legally, by Zinchenko but there were some brief howls of anguish from their fans. 8 min: The referee is Jonathan Moss, by the way. City keep pressing but Chelsea are offering up some spicy challenges and don\u2019t look like giving up chances easily just now. Rudiger has stepped in well a couple of times already. 5 min: Yes, it\u2019s a good start from City and now Aguero benefits from a ricochet and surges down the right, claiming a handball after a defender blocks his cross. Nothing is given. 3 min: City keeping the ball well early on. Has Sarri gone for the template that beat them in December? 1 min: Blimey \u2013 literally straight from kick-off Aguero tries to run past Jorginho and is sent flying by a stray arm. Looks very painful but he gets up, City take the free kick and then win an early corner .... which is cleared by Barkley. The death of Sarriball or the birth of something beautiful? It\u2019s an interesting question, to be fair. I doubt if I can find the answers in the next four minutes, but if anyone has stats to hand then do whack them over. The teams are striding out at Wembley right now \u2013 there\u2019ll be meeting, greeting, pleasantries, anthems, and then we\u2019ll be away! Oh gosh, yes, and shame on me because I\u2019m writing this a mere hop, skip, jump from Arsenal\u2019s home. They beat Southampton 2-0 with early Lacazette and Mkhitaryan goals! Joe Pearson writes: \u201cPerversely, with respect to Europa League qualification, it doesn\u2019t matter who wins this final (presuming the standings hold). If Chelsea wins, they qualify automatically. If City wins, the qualification falls to ... Chelsea.\u201d That is true and a good point. The stakes for Chelsea and Sarri are even higher than that though, I think. So does Pep, briefly! \u201c[The 6-0] was an incredibly important result for us but today is a final, a different competition, and hopefully we can play the game like a final deserves to be played.\u201d Sarri speaks! \u201cWe have played every three days [since the 6-0] so it\u2019s difficult to work on the pitch. We have talked a lot to try and improve. Two months ago we played [City] and won with a match of very great application. We know we can do better and better. \u201cI cannot understand why you ask me [about his future] because you know very well I can only give my opinion. You have to ask the club.\u201d We were not regaled with his opinion. \u201cChelsea playing the same frontline that beat City 2-0 late last year,\u201d notes Neil Bailey, and he has a point. Strange game, that was, because Chelsea got a grip of it after reverting very much to Plan B \u2013 ceding possession, basically. It finished goalless at Old Trafford, and was rather a slog. Half an hour til this one now ... Very nice from Paul Wilson, this, on how Chelsea could learn from City\u2019s example: The quality in United v Liverpool has been ... lacking, shall we say. We\u2019ll get better at Wembley, surely. Chelsea fans: right call to leave Higuain on the bench? Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but there\u2019s another game on at the moment. Simon Burnton will take you through the delicately-poised last knockings of Manchester United v Liverpool and then I\u2019ll have much more from this one. Get your thoughts and predictions in to me, in the meantime! Chelsea: Kepa, Azpilicueta, R\u00fcdiger, David Luiz, Emerson, Kant\u00e9, Jorginho, Barkley, Willian, Hazard, Pedro. Subs: Caballero, Christiansen, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Hudson-Odoi, Giroud, Higuain. Manchester City: Ederson, Zinchenko, Laporte, Otamendi, Walker, Fernandinho, Silva, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Sterling, Aguero. Subs: Muric, Danilo, Kompany, Gundogan, Sane, Mahrez, Foden. Strong from City, with Ederson in goal rather than Muric, who would usually expect to play in this competition. Guardiola is clearly desperate for the win. No Hudson-Odoi from the start for Chelsea despite his goal against Malmo on Thursday, but Jorginho and Hazard are among those to return \u2013 and Barkley starts. Higuain is on the bench. Presumably we will see Hazard as false nine, which tends to work well against lesser teams but not against good ones. The sun\u2019s out in north London, Wembley looks resplendent, you\u2019d almost think it is May. But this is the League Cup final, rather than the FA Cup final, and the storylines around this one might well keep us going until the latter. Manchester City will be gagging to tick off the first of a potential four trophies, and retain this one in the process, make no mistake about that. If they lose today then the chance to achieve something historic, if not massively likely, is gone. But for Chelsea there is something quite different at play. Chelsea last won this competition four years ago and would love to again. Should they fall short then you\u2019d fancy that Maurizio Sarri is done for; that Chelsea\u2019s revamp is over before it really began and that an exhausting cycle of upheaval starts over again? It was a 6-0 defeat at City a mere fortnight ago that suggested the goose was cooked \u2013 anything close to that would surely seal the deal today although I, for one, suspect we\u2019re in for something much chancier because that is how football tends to go. Players want to win stuff, that\u2019s the bottom line, and Chelsea\u2019s team of seasoned internationals will be desperate to do that today. There\u2019s no way City are six goals better than Chelsea on a normal day; this isn\u2019t a normal day but it\u2019s a cup final and that\u2019s usually a great leveller. Will it be enough? My view: whatever happens today you can\u2019t ditch Sarri, because it was obvious *before they even got him in* that he wasn\u2019t simply an instant-results guy, that this would take a year or two to develop and if they go away from that now then, under the current ownership, Chelsea are just going to confirm themselves as a basket case. Do what City did with Pep and let things grow over a quiet-ish first campaign! Has Sarri been hoist by the petard of such a fantastic start to the season, which even saw Chelsea being breathlessly suggested as title contenders in those early weeks? I think that, too. The football in recent weeks really hasn\u2019t been good but he needs longer to get his own people, and ideas, in \u2013 not just Jorginho, whose new status as the fans\u2019 fall guy seems entirely unreasonable and simply a deflection. Anyway. Will today be the day it all turns for Chelsea and Sarri? Is this all just a jaunty diversion from the inevitable either way? Is it the start of something quiet fabulous for a City side who haven\u2019t always reached last season\u2019s heights? So much to ponder, so little time: we\u2019re off, off and away at 4.30pm UK time.
