Only finishing top of a five-team group confirmed safe passage. Finish second and the best four went into play-offs for the eighth available spot. That it was the 2017 European champions, the Netherlands, who scraped through to France in that manner makes Scotland\u2019s automatic qualification for their first World Cup all the more impressive. On the final day of qualifying, Scotland were neck and neck with Switzerland in Group 2, dropping points only against each other. The Swiss had a superior goal difference, leaving Scotland needing to score six more against Albania should they remain level on points. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in our own hands,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt was technically in Switzerland\u2019s hands. \u201cFor us players that were on the pitch in the game, we didn\u2019t realise the score in the Switzerland game. So it wasn\u2019t until the final whistle went and all the subs and staff ran on to the pitch celebrating that we realised that, OK, we\u2019ve qualified for the World Cup. \u201cWe were anticipating that we would likely have to go through a play-off. But to directly go through as group winners was an amazing feeling.\u201d The Scots put themselves ahead early on. Kim Little, the Arsenal midfielder, who cruelly missed out on Scotland\u2019s first Euros in 2017 with a cruciate ligament injury, struck inside nine minutes. Against the run of play, Doci caught the Scottish defence napping to level the qualifier on the stroke of half\u2011time. With Switzerland being held in Poland there was still hope. In the 68th minute, Ross headed in the winner from a free-kick. \u201cWe knew that we just had to win the game. And that was all we could control. We done that. And, yeah, as they say, the rest is history,\u201d she says. At 29, the striker, born on the Isle of Bute, is one of the more experienced Scottish players travelling to France. After 104 goals in 118 games with SWPL\u2019s dominant Glasgow City she joined the Swedish side Vittsj\u00f6, then spent three years at Manchester City before moving to West Ham, helping Matt Beard\u2019s side to a Wembley FA Cup final in their first WSL season. She is also one of the players who made the trip to the Netherlands in 2017, but a shoulder injury in their crushing 6-0 loss to England added her to the swollen list of sidelined players. \u201cWe were missing a number of key players,\u201d says Ross. \u201cBut the players that were selected to go were of a good enough standard. It could have been different had it been a full-strength squad, but it is what it is. For the players that were selected, we\u2019ve gained experience from being to a major tournament and being there. To now add the players that were missing to the squad then it\u2019s only going to be stronger.\u201d Seven members of the 23-player squad are part-time. They have benefited from Scottish government funding to be able to train full-time before the World Cup and Scottish women\u2019s football is heading in the right direction. With Hibernian and Glasgow City leading the way, the increased investment of Rangers and the professionalism of Celtic are signs of positive change. For that reason, Ross was not worried that their poor showing at the 2017 Euros could have been their first and last shot at a major tournament. \u201cFootball in Scotland is on the rise, for sure,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s more players now playing professionally and doing it full-time and that\u2019s upping the quality and upping the pool of players for the national team coach to select from, which is helping the game grow.\u201d A strong finish, after three losses between January and March, was almost scuppered by Jamaica\u2019s Khadija Shaw, who scored twice in front of a record crowd at Hampden, but Sophie Howard\u2019s second-half effort ensured a 3-2 victory for the home side. That victory came on the back of an impressive 1-0 defeat of Brazil, Little scoring the winner, in what Ross describes as a \u201cbig confidence boost\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a bit of a mix of results since we started playing our friendly matches at the beginning of the year. But every camp we\u2019ve been learning and growing. Shelley Kerr\u2019s changed up a bit and tried different players and different formations at times.\u201d When Scotland were drawn in Group D alongside England it almost felt a set-up: \u201cI had a feeling we were going to draw England,\u201d says Ross, but it has not put them off their mission. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three difficult matches, but the goal that we set is to get out of the group,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it comes down to tournament football anything can happen. It\u2019s the usual cliche of taking it one game at a time. And so our first focus will be on the England match. We believe we can get something from that game. \u201cWe have the experience now of a major tournament. We\u2019re all older with two years more experience and playing under our belts. We\u2019re feeling good as a group, and hopefully going into the tournament with confidence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
