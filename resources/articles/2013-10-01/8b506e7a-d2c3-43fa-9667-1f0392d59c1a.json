Indeed at English National Opera's new staging by Christopher Alden it might have been wise to be totally blotto. Things started badly with a sagging overture, lacking the crystalline precision that makes Johann Strauss II's Viennese waltzing operetta glitter and intoxicate. Mild vaudeville fun never did anyone any harm, even if secretly you might prefer to be at Elektra by an unrelated but similarly named composer. But no, this was not to be fun at all. Soon, as we settled back for a few warm-hearted chortles, we were metaphorically clonked on the head by a jackbooted prison officer mimicking Nazi salutes and wagging a truncheon. A 1920s-ish salon with a vast, draped bed the size of Greater Bulgaria was quickly revealed to be no mere bedroom but a landscape of the mind with all its many chambers. Have I mentioned the pendulum pocket watch? Much ticking goes on in the witty score, but this \u2013 judging by size alone; it was big enough for the human \"bat\" of the title to sit astride it \u2013 was also a metaphor of mighty psychological importance which I must leave you to work out. It was omnipresent. This production, already staged in Toronto, was to be a serious and profound Fledermaus: all about Freud, the seamy underbelly of life in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna and sexual weirdness of the Sacher-Masoch rather than Sachertorte variety \u2013 as if we don't see enough of all that in the opera house already. Freud was born in 1856. The premiere of Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus (The Bat) was 1874. It was a heavy-handed updating. Constance Hoffman's delicious costumes \u2013 one of the few strengths of this leaden show \u2013 made the most of a strange line-up of partygoers, from transvestite ballerina to animal trainer to geisha to clown, with much use of exposed suspenders. The first 40 minutes dragged with barely a titter except from someone who sounded like a laughing machine \u2013 sitting, interestingly, in the front stalls right in the middle of the production team \u2013 and who simply exaggerated everyone else's stony silence. Soon we, or rather Alfred the \"Italian\" tenor, who on this occasion was Lithuanian (Edgaras Montvidas), were down to our underpants, immediately followed by a three-in-a-bed romp. At any given opportunity the pearl-grey satin counterpane heaved and danced in erotic grotesquerie. The bored Prince Orlofsky (Jennifer Holloway), at whose ball much of the plot's jiggery pokery unfolds, bore no resemblance to any kind of sane human being, ululating, flailing arms, doing funny walks \u2013 all reasonable, no doubt, if you're underemployed wealthy Russian royalty, but unbearable to watch. Christopher Alden is a wonderful, inspired director \u2013 his The Makropoulos Case and A Midsummer Night's Dream at ENO were outstanding \u2013 but here, perhaps in a cold panic, he has encouraged his poor singers to exaggerate gesture and mannerism ad nauseam. Fortunately Holloway was fine when released from all this grim harness and allowed to sing. Tom Randle, a versatile and endlessly classy performer, seemed to be doing his best to keep some proper restraint to proceedings and was a cool, caddish Eisenstein. He and Andrew Shore as Frank, a prison governor, ensured a degree of skilful comic timing which helped but could not rescue the show. Most of the dialogue was inaudible, and if there were jokes they got lost in translation, to put it kindly. Julia Spors\u00e9n, as Rosalinde, sounded underpowered in the opening phrases of the Cz\u00e1rd\u00e1s, though her performance was sympathetic and stylish. Richard Burkhard's Dr Falke, complete with bat wings, stood out for clarity and stage presence. The German actor Jan Pohl looked very uncomfortable as Frosch, he of the jackboots and salutes, as well he might. If only the brilliant ENO orchestra had sounded happier. Eun Sun Kim, making her house debut as conductor, was unable to elicit either vitality or exactitude from this score. What an evening. The Scottish pianist Steven Osborne, who last month won a Gramophone award to add to the other prizes and praises justifiably heaped on him, began a four-concert series at Wigmore Hall with some exceptional Beethoven playing: two groups of Bagatelles and two sonatas, the \"Waldstein\" Op 53 and Op 111. In a breathtaking recital, Osborne gave a definitive performance of this last, which opens in mid-breath, tempestuous and agitated, and ends with an endless, ethereal simplicity. The audience, as one, was agog. You can hear the concert on iPlayer until Tuesday (but he has recorded much of this repertoire on Hyperion). Osborne's attack is ferocious and fearless, his tenderness beyond words. His self appears subsumed in service to the composer. This is the best it gets.
