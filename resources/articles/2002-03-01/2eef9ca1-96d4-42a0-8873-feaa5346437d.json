He failed but the ball certainly made contact with something as it went through to the wicketkeeper. Neither team had brought an umpire that day and I was standing for a few overs at the other end, festooned in discarded sweaters. Thinking I had detected contact between the ball and the bat's edge as the batsman whirled round, I gave him out. He restricted himself to a hard look as he left the crease but in the dressing room afterwards he removed his shirt to display the bright purple bruise on the left hand side of his ribcage, just below the armpit. That was years ago, in a Sunday match of no great quality or consequence, but I have never forgotten it. Sometimes the memory seems more vivid than those of wickets taken or catches made or runs scored. I had spoilt someone's afternoon, as umpires occasionally do. Well, now there is a chance that fewer bad decisions will be made in future, albeit at a very different level of the game from mine. This week cricket's international governing body announced that the Champions Trophy tournament in Sri Lanka in September will be used as an opportunity to invite the third umpire to provide adjudication on any type of decision, subject to a few conditions: he can watch only two replays of an incident, he will try to keep his decision-making time within 20 seconds and he can never initiate a discussion with the field umpires, whose decision remains final. If there remained any doubt about the wisdom of the International Cricket Council's initiative, it was immediately allayed by the response from a corner of Yorkshire that is forever time-warped. \"Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the sport I love,\" Dickie Bird, the celebrated autobiographer, moped in a piece appearing under his byline in The Times. \"If this proposal is accepted, the umpire as we know him will be finished. He won't have anything to do apart from count the six balls in each over and hold a few jumpers.\" When he was umpiring, Bird contended, players accepted that umpires made occasional mistakes and just got on with it. \"All they asked for was consistency and common sense. That should still be enough.\" Was it ever enough? Here are some words written in 1891: \"Those of us who have any experience of country cricket know that the umpires' decisions do not always receive the respect due to them, and that many a match has terminated in a dispute. No man was ever justly out . . .\" That was Dr W G Grace's opinion and the grumbling has never stopped. The umpires' role was codified in the earliest published rules of cricket, written down in 1708 by a group of players based at the Star and Garter in Pall Mall. \"They are the sole judges of all outs and ins, of all fair and unfair Play, of frivolous delays, of all hurts, whether real or pretended, and are discretionally to allow whatever time they think proper before ye Game goes on again . . . Each umpire is ye sole Judge of all Nips and Catches, Ins and Outs, good and bad runs at his own Wicket, and his determination shall be absolute . . .\" The chaps at the Star and Garter did not have the benefit of Hawkeye, Sky TV's device for predicting the path of a ball that has been interrupted in its path by a pad, a bat or a part of the batsman's anatomy. They had recourse neither to super slo-mo nor to cameras arrayed around the ground, providing evidence from a variety of angles. Since theirs was a betting game, in which hundreds of pounds were wagered on a match, there can be little doubt that they would have taken advantage of any technology that might have been available to help them settle disputed decisions. Dickie Bird's view is predicated on the belief that mistakes and injustices even themselves out over time. To a philosopher, such a view might have some merit. To a batsman staring angrily at a bruise below his armpit, there is little comfort in the thought that by the end of a long career the good luck will have cancelled out the bad. There is simply no excuse for ignoring the chance to make better decisions. It is, after all, only fair to the players - who are just as important to the game as umpires, as almost anyone who has ever spoilt an innocent batsman's afternoon could tell you. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
