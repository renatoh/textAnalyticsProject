Fonte, who moved to St Mary\u2019s in 2010 from Crystal Palace, has just 18 months of his current deal remaining having failed to agree a new deal in the summer. His performances as part of Portugal\u2019s Euro 2016-winning side saw Southampton turn down an offer of around \u20ac9m (\u00a37.6m) from Everton for the 32-year-old, while Manchester United also showed an interest. But with Fonte unwilling to commit to extending his stay on the south coast beyond his current contract, Portuguese website Maisfutebol says the club have informed him he will be allowed to leave should they receive offers exceeding \u20ac6m (\u00a35m). That is likely to attract the attention of several Premier League clubs, although Jos\u00e9 Mourinho may fancy his chances of luring him to Old Trafford given he shares the same agent in Jorge Mendes. United have also shown an interest in signing the Sweden international Victor Lindel\u00f6f from Benfica, although the Portuguese club are thought to want more than \u00a340m for the 22-year-old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
