Must he really be taught \u2018British values\u2019?", "bodyText": "As a recent migrant to this country, I got a shock when my husband and I looked for a childminder for our baby. The ones we met told us that alongside development goals such as eating solids and saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cDada\u201d, our child would be learning \u201cBritish values\u201d. One had an official Ofsted-approved British values \u201cwheel\u201d displayed on her wall, next to educational posters designed to teach shapes and colours. The wheel had a picture of a doe-eyed child in the centre, with green arrows radiating from the child to the values, written on a yellow disc. I asked her about this baffling graphic and she rolled her eyes. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cThe British values. Got to have them.\u201d This was the first I\u2019d heard of \u201cBritish values\u201d. At first I assumed this must be an old, proud British tradition \u2013 it seemed like the only plausible reason to teach them to all children, including babies, as well as to label the innocuous, mundane sentiments on the childminders\u2019 laminated printout as specifically \u201cBritish\u201d. But then I found out that this idea is barely five years old. In June 2014, the then-education secretary, Michael Gove, introduced them as part of the government\u2019s response to the now discredited Trojan horse affair, in which Islamic extremists supposedly attempted to take over schools in Birmingham. The Trojan horse affair may have been a fake, but British values are apparently here to stay. So what are these so-called British values? According to the government, they are: democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. These values were first laid out in the government\u2019s Prevent counter-extremism strategy in 2011, a set of guidelines intended ostensibly to \u201cprepare children for life in modern Britain\u201d. Schools and nurseries are now required to \u201cactively promote\u201d them, for example by: \u201cinclud[ing] in suitable parts of the curriculum \u2013 as appropriate for the age of pupils \u2013 material on [\u2026] how democracy and the law works in Britain, in contrast to other forms of government in other countries\u201d. How to explain that in an age-appropriate way for my son, who is seven months old, was not made clear. The childminders we spoke to cared for up to six children at a time by themselves, or with one assistant, in their homes. These homes were spotless and orderly, run with precision and grace. Many of these women were migrants and mothers themselves. It seems like a farce to pretend that they should be responsible for making sure my baby isn\u2019t being indoctrinated into extremist ideology or that he appreciates the rule of law. But then British values were not added to his curriculum because child education experts thought they were appropriate, or educationally sound \u2013 they were added because of fears of religiously motivated violence. My son is still working on learning to crawl, and on eating foods that are any texture other than a puree. He also has a tendency to pull plates off tables, bang his head against the wall, and try to roll off the changing table. I don\u2019t want his childminders\u2019 time wasted on remembering to impart vague propaganda when they have the extremely challenging responsibility of looking after other people\u2019s children. Yet they risk losing their livelihoods if they don\u2019t teach these notional values. To be clear, I do think my son should be taught morals and ethics as he gets older. I just don\u2019t understand the need to pretend that the concepts he learns will be uniquely or especially \u201cBritish\u201d. I\u2019m from the US, where we have plenty of talk in our schools about the greatness of our nation. I was often told to recite the pledge of allegiance, which claims the US offers \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d, as well as adding that we\u2019re a nation \u201cunder God\u201d, despite our constitution\u2019s separation of church and state. But as I grew older, I was also taught about the atrocities in our past, such as slavery and the Trail of Tears (the forced relocation of Native Americans). A dark-chapter-filled history is something the US has in common with Britain, with its legacy of colonialism and empire. And as he grows older, I want my son\u2019s teachers and curriculum-designers to always bear in mind the mistakes of the past, not lionise the nation\u2019s history into a narrative of nostalgic or nationalistic haze. My husband and I met childminders who migrated to Britain from Eritrea, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Sierra Leone, all nations that suffered under European colonial rule. It seems particularly cruel to force people whose ancestors were brutalised by British colonists to indoctrinate children into the idea that \u201cindividual liberty\u201d is a fundamentally or uniquely British value. I want my son eventually to learn about British history, the good and the bad. I want him to learn about US history in the same way. And I hope his carer \u2013 we eventually chose the childminder from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2013 will teach him about the country she was born in, and about her family\u2019s traditions. That multiculturalism will go a lot further to demonstrate the inclusive, strong and respectful nature of Britain today than the force-feeding of \u201cBritish values\u201d ever could. \u2022 Amelia Granger is an American writer and former journalist living in London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
