Although facing a 2-1 deficit is hardly an insurmountable obstacle ahead of the return leg of their Uefa Cup quarter-final with Sevilla at White Hart Lane on Thursday, last night's match was turned completely around when the referee Alain Hamer awarded a highly controversial penalty. A header from Paul Stalteri had hit Pascal Chimbonda and bounced behind the Tottenham defence and into the path of Adriano. Paul Robinson, though, was alert to the danger and seemed to get his hand to the ball as he met the on-rushing Brazilian. Adriano went to ground and Hamer pointed to the penalty spot. \"The referee told me I had got my hand on the ball and then caught his leg, I was devastated when he gave it - it was a ridiculous decision,\" said Robinson. If Hamer was convinced that Robinson had fouled Adriano, it was bizarre that he issued only a yellow card. There was a sense of inevitably about the confident way Fredi Kanoute converted the penalty against his former club for his 23nd goal of the season. Until that moment Tottenham had looked comfortable in possession and secure at the back after taking a second minute lead through Robbie Keane. \"It was the start we wanted but it was spoiled by the penalty decision. It was a disgrace,\" said Keane. As it was, this was the first blemish to Tottenham's Uefa Cup campaign this season and only their second defeat in their past 11 matches. Spurs also have the comfort of what could be a crucial Keane away goal to take with them into the return leg. \"I don't think it was a disappointing result, I was just disappointed with the decision,\" said the Tottenham head coach Martin Jol. \"I think the penalty decision affected us more than what happened in the stands. We still feel we have got a chance in the second leg.\" Defeats to Chelsea and Arsenal in cup competitions this season had contributed to a feeling that, although Tottenham have enjoyed a season of great promise, they are not yet ready to upset the very top clubs in Europe. Sevilla, who are pushing for a first La Liga title since 1946, certainly belong among the continent's elite group just now and Jol was clearly mindful of the threat posed by their outstanding Brazilian full-back Daniel Alves. His solution was to enhance the defensive qualities of Tottenham's left flank by replacing Steed Malbranque with Teemu Tainio in front of Young-Pyo Lee. After Uefa refused a request to switch the date of this match, the Sevilla head coach Juande Ramos had expressed concern that the excitement of the religious festival in the city this week would subdue support for his team. His initial problem, though, concerned the lethargic start from his players. Within a minute, Dimitar Berbatov had peeled off into a shooting position and, although that chance came to nothing, the Bulgarian split Sevilla's defence with his next contribution. His understanding with Keane has become deadly in recent months and the Irishman timed his run perfectly to collect the pass and shoot beyond Andr\u00e9s Palop from a narrow angle after the Sevilla goalkeeper had blocked the first attempt. There were just 68 seconds on the clock. Tottenham looked comfortable until the harsh penalty decision. It completely altered the mood of the match and, as attention focused on the violence unfolding in the stands, Sevilla took control of the game and were put into the lead on 39 minutes when Aleksandr Kerzhakov converted Julien Escude's cross. The problems within the Tottenham enclosure eased after half-time and Jol's team enjoyed a period of sustained pressure. Tainio began to put Alves at right-back under pressure and his cute pass found Keane, who should really have done better when dragging his effort wide. The substitute Steed Malbranque also snatched at a good opportunity when put through by Keane on 85 minutes as Tottenham pressed for an equaliser. Turning pressure into chances, though, was proving difficult. For Sevilla, Kanoute continued to look the major threat and missed a golden opportunity to put the Uefa Cup holders into what might have been an unassailable 3-1 lead when he headed wide from 12 yards. Ramos believes that the match is delicately balanced: \"Spurs will have a home crowd pushing them, it will be very tough,\" he said, \"a goal is important but in such a tight match it is a very slender lead we created less chances than normal.\" Tottenham will hope for a better night on and off the field next week, but their hopes of progressing to a first European semi-final since 1984 remain alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
