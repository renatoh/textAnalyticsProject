There will also be music from rising singer-songwriter Laura Doggett, Swedish newcomer Seinabo Sey, cult Americans the War On Drugs, and a chap who I saw live at Stamford Bridge on the weekend - not kicking a ball around, no, singing in a venue under the stadium: Afrobeats king Fuse ODG. You can\u2019t argue with a lineup like that. Well, you can. But as I - and Mrs D - said, that\u2019s the whole point of Later... Isn\u2019t it? Good point, Mrs D, whoever you are - Later... is almost designed to generate a mixture of devotion and loathing because if you love Plant you\u2019re bound to hate Stormzy, and so on. That\u2019s the joy of it - you watch it, find the bits you like, then have a good moan about the rest. People keep saying they want Top Of The Pops back, but that had the same function - you watched it, loved some of it, thought the rest was rubbish. I\u2019m trying to find a lover - is that the vernacular opposite of hater? - for Gedeon and the Crows on Twitter, but I\u2019m not having much luck. Anyone? Clare Partington loved Planty, even if her dog was unmoved. Emma Lake would appear to believe that Years &amp; Years are going to be one of the breaking acts for 2015, if I am to infer correctly. I thought that went rather well, actually. A fine mixture of the good and the horrible. The horrible worked especially well because it made the good seem even better. Hurrah for the horrible! Someone shared my enjoyment of Stormzy. Jools introduces a clip of Jack Bruce, who sadly died this week, performing on Later... Then some japes to do with the sound man, and to finish, some more Plant and pals. This is way better than the track they played energy. Has some of the rumble and growl of Zep. Is more than just a showcase for other countries\u2019 musical idioms, an amuse-bouche of ethnic flavours. \u201cBaby, baby, baby...\u201d Ah, just like the old days. The end. He is wearing budget sports-wear, but then, he did only give up his full-time job earlier this year (a job which remains, as I find out to my cost earlier, unknown). This is menacing-lite London grime, but it\u2019s pretty good. I like the fact that the gentleman on the \u201cdecks\u201d is wearing almost-matching grey sports duds. Nice deployment of shades over beanie, too. Cool, minimalist stage setting reflecting atmospheric grimetronica. More handclaps! It\u2019s tonight\u2019s leitmotif! Wow, she looks amazing, as she sings, and plays double-drums to, Water Fountain. Garbus, and band, it teeters on that fine line between wanky-kooky and cool performance artistry. Shades of Tom Tom Club about this track. African-influenced but far more interesting an absorption of that continent\u2019s music than that effected by Mr Plant, I\u2019d venture, cautiously, to gauge the reaction, and then grab my coat. Plant and Jools in convo! What credentials do you need to be a Space Shifter? Ah, very good. It\u2019s painful business as usual. Although we have just learned that concerts will involve hillbilly, African music, even some Led Zep songs. A new trio, part of the new/current wave of pop-house, the Disclosure/Duke Dumont/Gorgon City generation. But with arguably even more pre-teen pop appeal - the sob in the singer\u2019s voice suggests they\u2019re going for heartthrob appeal. Still, this is by some margin the best thing on the show so far. Rousing house melancholia? What\u2019s not to like? I really like the singer - he\u2019s just vulnerable enough, and he\u2019s not projecting passion violently, in our faces. Which is nice. If you like grunge without the angst, the nihilistic energy, the dark bitter undertaste, the self-loathing, the forensic scrutiny of the soul, you\u2019ll probably be a lifelong fan of the Crows. What is - or indeed has ever been - the point of Counting Crows? This is unappealing on every - sonic, visual - level. Still, he wants to be an earthquake driver. And he doesn\u2019t want to go home. Perhaps we can help with the air fare? Live Free is the song. The one about loving each other. The band appear to have raided Lenny Kravitz\u2019s wardrobe, and scarpered out the door before they could finish getting dressed. This is horrible. I\u2019m sorry, but it is. The booker should be taken outside now and made to do several hundred press-ups. It is beyond parody. Prince might sue, if he could be bothered. Somewhere, Janelle Monae is smiling. I am going to love tonight\u2019s episode even if it kills me. (\u201cToday, a music journalist died whilst watching a BBC TV music show\u201d - a passing news reporter). Right, who\u2019s first? Bobby P! As nobody - alive - has ever called him. Wow, is that a face they could put in a dictionary next to the word \u201cgrizzled\u201d, or what? He\u2019s leading the crowd in some mass handclaps, already, so soon! Evidently his latest album could be filed under \u201cintriguing world music with Americana tinges\u201d in a record shop with loads of space for multiple micro-genres. A glimpse of The Wail aka the ceaseless roar just then. He just whooped! This is perhaps more fun for him than anyone else. It is the sort of \u201cexperimental\u201d music a man d\u2019un certain age might make. The stage is a riot of clapping musicians. Human Universe is currently on BBC2. In many ways, Brian Cox is the Jools Holland of antimatter and metaphysics, is he not? Only instead of boogie-woogie piano and banal patter, his stock-in-trades are atomic particles and existential wonder. Stormzy\u2019s irresistible rise seems to have bypassed a lot of the usual media. I wanted to find out more about him. So I watched this interview with him about how the South London MOBO-winning grime artist quit his job earlier this year to focus on his music, and the interviewer neglected to ask him what that job was. I\u2019m dying to know now! Was he a botanist? A trainee architect? A shelf stacker at B&amp;Q? Here\u2019s how to do a not even vaguely probing interview. In fact, it\u2019s a masterclass. Merrill Garbus is rather looking forward to appearing alongside one of her favourite musicians. Clue: it\u2019s not Stormzy. Or Jools. It has long been the tradition of the Later... blog - one that stretches back generations and generations, to when the internet was filled with screeds scrawled on parchment with sticks - to offer pen portraits of the acts on the show, only not with a pen, a keyboard. And tonight is no different. And so, allow me to present, in the manner of Vernon Kay on a Channel 4 programme about American Football, but with added asterisks:- *Robert Plant! who will be performing tracks, with his backing band the Sensational Space Shifters, from his latest album Lullaby and the Ceaseless Roar. I say tracks plural: he will presumably be opening and closing the show. It\u2019s between him and Stormzy. *Counting Crows! who return to the show for the first time since 1997, with material (cloth, probably) from their new album Somewhere Under Wonderland, their first collection of original tunes for six years. Did that sentence produce even a scintilla of excitement? I always thought Counting Crows were for people who found Pearl Jam too avant-garde and intense. *Gedeon Luke and the People! whose Memphis soul performance is going to be so full of testifying fervour, so gritty and sweaty, you will possibly need a shower afterwards. *Stormzy! who is a South London grime artist and winner of a MOBO Award for Best Grime Act (from South London or anywhere else). *Years &amp; Years! who I am going to see at Brixton Academy tomorrow night, supporting Clean Bandit, where I will hopefully have proved my theory that they a pop-house boyband, Disclosure meets One Direction. *tUnE-yArDs! The Oakland-based Merrill Garbus will be playing something from her recent third album Nikki Nack, and quietly cursing St Vincent for stealing her thunder. Just kidding. In fact, they interviewed each other a while back for Noisey. See, they love each other really. Of the two I\u2019ve not heard of, I just played one of them - Gedeon Luke and the People - on Spotify. A track called Live Free. The words go, \u201cWe got to love each other/I wish you\u2019d understand.\u201d It is the Jools-est piece of music I have ever heard in my life. It makes the bloke from the Commitments sound like Kraftwerk. Of the six acts on tonight, I\u2019ve heard of a grand total of four of them. This might be a good thing. Then again, it might not. There\u2019s no doubt about it - it\u2019s time for Later... Episode No 7 out of a grand total of 8, from Series 45 out of a grand total of who-knows-how-many? Does anyone know the stats for how many people have been watching this series? Has anyone been scrutinising the unflappable cockney host\u2019s forehead for beads of sweat? Or seen him leafing through the pages of the Guardian\u2019s Situations Vacant? Then again, the numbers could have gone through the roof this season and they could be lining him up to present the US version of the show. Unlikely, I know, but even Vernon Kay got a job for about five minutes in the States, didn\u2019t he? Or was he just fronting a programme about American football? Anyway, like I say, it\u2019s Later... time. And to commemorate this august moment (in October), I have designed a bespoke graphic bearing the names of tonight\u2019s guests. Took me all day, it did. Here it is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
