They span virtually his whole career, from the early 1940s to the mid-1970s, and were composed for a variety of forces and singers. But for all their differences of subject matter, from biblical stories to meditations on love and loss, Ian Bostridge's concert with pianist Julius Drake revealed the consistency of the soundworld created by these mysterious pieces. Joined by counter-tenor David Daniels and baritone Christopher Maltman, the whole sequence, played without applause, had a cumulative dramatic power. The solo tenor is the single connection between each piece. All five were composed for Peter Pears, and chart the personal and creative relationship between Britten and his most important muse. In the First Canticle, My Beloved Is Mine, the tenor celebrates the joys of being with his \"best beloved\", in a setting of a Francis Quarles text. Bostridge and Drake caught the febrile intensity of Britten's depiction of blissful content. If the First is a self-contained aria, the Second is a miniature opera, staging the drama of the Abraham and Isaac story. Bostridge's commanding performance as Abraham voiced the terrible dilemma caused by God's demands, while Daniels's selfless Isaac was the picture of perfect innocence. Drake paced the performance superbly, as the story moved effortlessly between the impassive voice of God (which Britten represents by using both singers) and the emotions of father and son. Horn-player David McClenaghan featured in the Third Canticle, which sets Edith Sitwell's Still Falls the Rain. Composed shortly after The Turn of the Screw, the Canticle shares that opera's claustrophobic, oppressive atmosphere. But Still Falls the Rain is even more bleak. Each stanza is separated by an interlude for the horn, which sounds a deathly fanfare for the wounded and dying of Sitwell's poem. Bostridge turned the austerity of Britten's structure into a vivid, terrifying lament. The final two canticles set texts by TS Eliot: The Journey of the Magi and The Death of Saint Narcissus. Maltman, Daniels and Bostridge relished the pilgrimage of Britten's profoundly ambiguous kings, while harpist Aline Brewer accompanied Bostridge in the liquid lyricism of the Fifth Canticle.
