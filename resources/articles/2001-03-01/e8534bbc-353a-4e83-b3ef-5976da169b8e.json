Wins for Wolves over their neighbours, and vice versa, are always sweet but this was sweeter than most. It was their first in eight attempts over their oldest and bitterest rivals and also represented a high spot in another season of underachievement. Out of the play-off running but free from relegation worries, at least Wolves supporters have some consolation to cheer them until August, and with Joleon Lescott solid in defence and another teenager Adam Proudlock full of intelligent running up front, there is also plenty to anticipate. With a little more composure against an Albion defence that looks as stable as a henhouse in a hurricane, Proudlock could have capped a promising performance with a couple of goals. Instead George Ndah made his mark in an act of direct retribution given that in his previous game against Albion he sustained a broken leg and had to sit out the next year. That injury followed an old-time challenge by Matt Carbon and Jones warned Ndah not to take the law into his own hands. Ndah, heeding the advice, opted for a legitimate method of revenge and was rewarded with two goals and was named man of the match. \"He fully deserve it, and the rest of my players were not far behind,\" the Wolves manager confirmed. \"They worked tremendously hard and this represented another stage in our rebuilding.\" Jones's quite satisfaction came in stark contrast to the undisguised rage of his Albion counterpart, Gary Megson. \"If anybody says I'm disappointed they would be badly wrong,\" he said. \"I'm furious, and not one of my players can expect to be in the team next week. \"We were sadly lacking and it's a huge embarrassment to have brought 3,000 of our supporters here and performed like that. There was no verve, no zest, no passion and no desire. We are sixth in the table but looked as though we were at the bottom. It could have been eight.\" It could well have been, and if Albion do reach the Premiership via the play-offs, Messrs Henry, Owen and Yorke will be licking their lips at thought of taking on such a flimsy defence. Easy pickings will be on the menu as Ndah discovered in the 23th minute. Put clear at the left edge of the penalty area by Carl Robinson's through ball, the striker went past the Albion goalkeeper Russell Hoult before guiding the ball inside the far post between the retreating Carbon and Tony Butler. Hoult did get a touch to prevent Wolves increasing their lead in the 36th minute when, diving to his right, he diverted Ludo Pollet's well-struck volley on to a post. But he was left helpless when the game was put out of reach following two set-pieces. The first came in the dying seconds of the half when, after a short corner, Andy Sinton crossed from the right for Ndah to head home. Sinton was again the provider for the third, again from a corner. This time he delivered the ball long and Pollet headed home from distance. Neil Clement volleyed home a consolation goal in the dying minutes, but it did nothing to assuage Megson's fury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
