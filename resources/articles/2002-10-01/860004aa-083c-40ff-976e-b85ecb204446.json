In an exclusive poll of the 18 chief executives in the latest edition of Wisden Cricket Monthly, 11 counties said crowds had increased in one or both forms of the game. Even the three relegated clubs, Yorkshire, Somerset and Hampshire, reported an upturn in attendances. This follows a 17% decline over the previous five summers. Andrew Walpole, media relations manager at the England and Wales Cricket Board, said: \"We will not be in a position to give figures until the end of the week, or even next week, because we are still collating them. \"But the reports are most encouraging and we welcome them. This shows that the support base for county cricket is stronger than many people realise.\" In the poll four counties - Derbyshire, Essex, Leicestershire and Surrey - reported that attendances had been much the same as the previous year. Two clubs, Durham and Northamptonshire, who both had poor seasons, said their gates were down; Lancashire did not know. Kent reported that attendances had gone up by 33%, excluding membership. Warwickshire said that between 500 to 1,000 extra spectators had come to most days of county cricket. Worcestershire attracted an average of 3,301 to championship games, compared with 2,679 in 2001. Nottinghamshire's chief executive David Collier said: \"Despite a wet summer our figures were up. A good international season rubbed off on the domestic game.\" The fact that some counties reported an increase towards the end of the season suggested that two divisions, with promotion and relegation, had helped maintain interest through the summer. Meanwhile Yorkshire have given new three-year contracts to Craig White and Anthony McGrath and a one-year deal to the wicketkeeper Richard Blakey, who led the side in the absence of Darren Lehmann last season. No decision has been made on the captaincy next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
