I have gone straight to the difficult issues I heard on the doorstep \u2013 the deficit, immigration and benefits \u2013 because we won\u2019t win until we regain the public\u2019s trust on them. But this doesn\u2019t mean copying the Tories. Labour wins when we are better than they are. We know the best way to bring down the social security bill is to tackle low pay and Britain\u2019s dysfunctional housing market. Facing up to our weaknesses is essential. But it has given the leadership debate a negative feel. The time has come to lift people with a bigger vision. That is what I will do, starting on Monday, with the first of five speeches putting my stamp on the party. I will confront a straightforward question: in the 21st century, what is Labour for? My answer is simple: to help everyone get on. The word \u201caspiration\u201d has dominated the election aftermath. This is because our manifesto, while strong on inequality and insecurity, did not have enough to say to people in the middle. But the \u201caspiration\u201d call is controversial: it is seen as code for a return to the days when Labour focused more on middle-income voters. It is undoubtedly true that Tony Blair had a message that resonated with them. But it also true that Ed Miliband won back traditional supporters: my good friend, Steve Rotheram MP, was re-elected with 81% of the vote in Liverpool Walton. In recent years, Labour has developed an unappealing habit of trying to compartmentalise the public. We have used a \u201cmosaic\u201d marketing system that puts patronising labels on people. We have talked of a \u201cretail offer\u201d as if politics were just another branch of the consumer society. This is the thinking Labour must leave behind. We will win when we combine the best of Tony and Ed, stop prioritising one group of voters above another, and speak convincingly to the aspirations of all. People share the same hopes: a secure job; a decent home; a good standard of living; prospects for their kids; and proper care for their parents. But these dreams are dying for millions. Labour\u2019s mission must be to revive them. That is what an Andy Burnham Labour party will be all about, because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been about. What brought me into politics was my journey from a Merseyside comprehensive to Cambridge University. I saw life from all sides and how much harder it is for some to make their way in this world. I still recall the disorientation I felt when asked at my interview in a book-lined study: \u201cDo you see a parallel between The Canterbury Tales and modern package holidays?\u201d I was still pondering what the question meant when I arrived at Warrington station six hours later and when the rejection letter dropped through the door. I eventually got to Cambridge and, while I loved my time there, I never lost the sense of an interloper. That was 25 years ago. But today it\u2019s even harder for a young person of a similar background to make their way in the world. Those who can\u2019t fall back on well-off parents can\u2019t get on. The average age of a first-time buyer today without parental help is 37. The best universities are still dominated by the wealthiest families. And the options for those not on the university route are still seen as second-class. This is one of this country\u2019s greatest postwar public policy failures. Our schools system is geared towards the university route. But the same cannot be said for those who aspire to a technical education. They have been neglected by successive parliaments populated by people who went to university. No wonder so many people feel that politics doesn\u2019t speak to them. I will change that. I will take Labour out of the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d and I start on Monday with a plan for a revolution in technical education. The best way to raise standards in all schools is to give all children hope and something to aim for. I want apprenticeships to have the same prestige as university places and young people given the same help to access them. This is what I mean by a Labour party that exists to help everyone get on. Aspiration isn\u2019t the preserve of certain voters; it is felt by everyone. But, in our insecure modern world, the light of hope is going out for far too many. The Labour party I lead will turn it back on. Andy Burnham is MP for Leigh"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
