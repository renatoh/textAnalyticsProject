Bit of a mistake posting the job advert on Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, really, since everyone can see the requests - in this case, among others, \"Write a Positive 5/5 Review for Product on Website\" (including hints like \"Use your best possible grammar and write in US English only\" - guess that stuffs a lot of us then - \"Always give a 100% rating (as high as possible)\" and \"Write as if you own the product and are using it\". Oh, and also \"Mark any other negative reviews as 'not helpful' once you post yours.\" Oh dear. A quick LinkedIn search turned up the person who made the request, Mike Bayard, who was offering 65 cents per (positive) review. Who he? He a \"business development representative\" for Belkin. Mechanical Turk, in case you've not noticed, is Amazon's \"human-powered computer\" - basically, people who consider whether they'll do the work for the price you're offering. The router being pimped has \"consistently gotten bad reviews\", says The Daily Background, which uncovered the story. Although once it did (good thing it took screengrabs), Bayard pulled the ads. Not, however, before they came to Belkin's notice. Its president Mark Reynoso posted an email and letter on the Belkin site saying that it was with great surprise and dismay when we discovered that one of our employees may have posted a number of queries on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website inviting users to post positive reviews of Belkin products in exchange for payment. Belkin does not participate in, nor does it endorse, unethical practices like this. We know that people look to online user reviews for unbiased opinions from fellow users and instances like this challenge the implicit trust that is placed in this interaction. We regard our responsibility to our user community as sacred, and we are extremely sorry that this happened. So what have they done? - We've acted swiftly to remove all associated postings from the Mechanical Turk system. - We're working closely with our online channel partners to ensure that any reviews that may have been placed due to these postings have been removed. One has to say that it was hardly a stellar success. There's precisely one 5-star review and one 4-star review on the page. That's a total 65c (perhaps $1.30) outlay, which has pushed the average rating from one star to... 1.5 stars. Give it another ten bucks, you might be pushing four stars. You might be able to spot the fake review, by the way. Right, that sorts it, doesn't it? Err.. hang on. No word about Mr Boyard. At the very least, might he not be encouraged to sit on the naughty step for a bit? (With everything that's going on, we wouldn't wish him out of a job.) But of his fate, there's no word. Wouldn't it have been cheaper, though, to just fix the router? The one in question, by the way, is the Belkin F5U301 CableFree 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub with Dongle. Anyone got one? How's it going? Give us a potted review, why not?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
