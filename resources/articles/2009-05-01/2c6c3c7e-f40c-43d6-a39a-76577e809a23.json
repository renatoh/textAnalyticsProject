His jury team candidates will \"shake up the cosy consensus in UK politics\", he says, but the effort begins in Europe. Prepare for change. And thanks to a leak to the magazine PR Week, we can see what change will look like \u2013 for Sir Paul (pictured) seems set to appoint a PR firm whose duties will include tasks that to many seem integral to the political process: \"being the first point of contact for candidates; signing up and motivating volunteers to leaflet on behalf of our candidates; helping to co-ordinate campaigning days; other campaigning ideas that will help increase our share of the vote\". For every candidate the PR firm gets elected, it will receive a bonus of \u00a310,000. Other parties seem convinced of the need for more grassroots engagement but, who knows, Sir Paul may be on to something. More money in politics. More spin. Sounds brill. \ue136We see a record of the post-cabinet briefing for lobby correspondents, and it is hard to erase the thought that the government is no longer taken seriously. \"Did the prime minister have full confidence in Ms Blears?\" the official spokesman was asked. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Did the prime minister give her a 'hair-dryer'?\" asked the questioner. \"Is that a question about her hair?\" asked the spokesman. \"Well, obviously he did not help her with her hair,\" replied the journalist. \"Apparently, it is a Downing Street phrase for a rollicking.\" There was, the assembled were told, a cabinet discussion about the British economy in the light of European predictions, which make the chancellor's own figures seem optimistic. \"Did they just throw their arms helplessly in the air?\" asked a correspondent. The thrill is gone. Light is fading. \ue136But still there is excitement about that explosive critique by Hazel Blears \u2013 with its plea for ordinary Labour activists to connect with ordinary folk by deploying their \"meta- narratives\". Chief among the topics being discussed: who actually wrote it. Few believe that Hazel \u2013 salt of Salford and all that \u2013 would have resorted to tiresome wonk-speak, and she is said to be surprised at the fuss the article caused. Might Paul Richards, her adviser, who has wonk-speak as a second language, have brought his experience to bear? The man who wrote Be Your Own Spin Doctor may well have a pithy turn of phrase. If it's you, Paul, take the credit. \ue136Widespread concern about the foreign doctor who arrived to work as GP cover without benefit of sleep or knowhow and caused the death of a patient. Some question anew the government's system for GP cover. Others question the competence of those who employed the hapless medic. And then there is Dr Stuart Russell, who emails my colleague James Meikle. His bugbear is identity. \"According to your Grauniad piece, Dr Daniel Ubani is a German,\" he says. \"Is that really true \u2013 he doesn't look like a German to me. Are you completely mad?\" \"He is indeed German,\" replies Meikle. \"He has a German passport.\" But Dr Russell remains unconvinced. \"A German passport doesn't make him a German,\" he says. \"Race matters \u2013 he is African. How would ethnic Germans react to the idea that being German is merely about having a piece of paper? What about their history and culture \u2013 Beethoven, Bach etc? Does that count for nothing?\" And this all seems very puzzling until one realises that for many years we knew Dr Stuart Russell as Phil Edwards, the once hyperactive press spokesman for Nick Griffin's racist BNP. That understood, it all makes sense. \ue136Finally, pity the editors at Sky News who had to choose between Gordon unveiling Labour's new education initiative and Joanna Lumley, Queen of the Gurkhas, sprinkling her stardust on to the home affairs select committee. Joanna won. For non-stop Gordon, there's always YouTube. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
