Johnson comprehensively won the first ballot of Tory MPs on Thursday, in which Hunt came a distant second, and the foreign secretary is now appearing to present himself as the only challenger who can \u201coffer something different\u201d to Johnson. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Hunt accused Johnson of preventing a wider debate about Brexit in the party, which its members wanted to hear. \u201cWe can only have that debate if our frontrunner in this campaign is a little bit braver in terms of getting out into the media and actually engaging in the TV debates,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would Churchill say if someone who wants to be prime minister of the United Kingdom is hiding away from the media, not taking part in these big occasions?\u201d Hunt said this was the 16th time he had been on the Today programme in the last year, while Johnson had only appeared once, and that the 2019 contest could amount to \u201ca coronation without a huge amount of scrutiny\u201d, as in 2016 when Theresa May became leader. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn this into a rerun of the 2005 campaign where a little-known outsider, David Cameron, came in and turned the tables,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of contest, with real scrutiny, that we need to have.\u201d Hunt lauded his credentials as an entrepreneur, someone who has relationships with European governments and as somebody who formerly \u201cran our biggest public service, the NHS\u201d, and claimed there had never been a prime minister with such a background. \u201cIt is clear that if we are going to give the Conservative party a choice, and someone who can offer something different to Boris, then I am that person.\u201d Responding to questions about having shifted his position on Brexit, from remain to being open to a no deal, Hunt said: \u201cNot at all, I\u2019ve been consistent. Actually, Boris is the person who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal and then for Theresa May\u2019s deal. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that, in extremis, if it was the only way we could deliver Brexit then I would very reluctantly do a no-deal Brexit but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at that point yet.\u201d On Johnson\u2019s commitment to leaving the EU by the current deadline, Hunt \u2013 who won the votes of 43 MPs, less than 15% of the party \u2013 said: \u201cHis hard stop on 31 October is effectively saying that the best we can offer the country is either a no-deal Brexit or a general election .. I think we have to ask whether that is best for the country. \u201cWhat European leaders say is that, of course, if someone approached them with some new ideas they would look at the whole package, and of course, they are willing to do that because they don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit either.\u201d Asked if Johnson would be a good prime minister, Hunt said: \u201cI hope he would be if he becomes prime minister. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question in advance. But, if he gets the job I will do everything in my power to make him a successful prime minister.\u201d Hunt refused to be drawn on claims by the foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan that cleaning up after Johnson\u2019s gaffes when he was foreign secretary was a \u201cfull-time activity\u201d that required a \u201cpooper-scooper\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
