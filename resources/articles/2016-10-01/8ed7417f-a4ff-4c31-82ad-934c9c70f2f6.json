Any team posting (real-life) highlights face a $25,000 from the league, which has denied the move is in response to falling television ratings. Under the new rules, teams are also banned from posting video from their own stadiums during games. NFL Players Association spokesman George Atallah said the league\u2019s actions had given rise to the \u201cpeak ridiculous\u201d situation of teams posting fake highlights. The NFL did not comment on the tweets from the Browns and Eagles. It is unclear whether the toys in question will count towards the teams\u2019 salary caps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
