In an interview on Radio National on Tuesday, Butler reiterated comments to Guardian Australia that the opposition would consider supporting what he called the \u201csecond best\u201d option to Labor\u2019s emissions intensity scheme. The comments suggest Labor could accept a compromise position designed by the government to limit greenhouse gas emissions and achieve investment certainty for power generation, despite hostility from Coalition conservatives to any mechanism that directly prices carbon. Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is expected to recommend a low-emissions target in his report to the Council of Australian Governments on Friday. The target would require that a percentage of electricity be generated annually from \u201clow-emissions\u201d sources, effectively working in practice as a technology-neutral renewable energy target. On Monday the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, warned that the government\u2019s policy had to change, because doing nothing would drive up power prices. After telling Guardian Australia that Labor had an open mind on the LET, Butler said on Tuesday it was \u201cnot going to pretend that this is not a second-best option\u201d. He argued there was an \u201cextraordinary consensus\u201d that an emissions intensity scheme was the \u201cfirst best way forward\u201d but Malcolm Turnbull had been unable to convince the Coalition of its merits. Butler said the proposal was still unclear because there were two options, one involving a subsidy to particular types of clean energy and the second involving trading of clean energy certificates. \u201cThere will be some conditions that we match this model \u2013 again. There has to be enduring reform. If we\u2019re going to junk a policy that we took to the election, then we\u2019ll want to be confident this is something that will stand the test of time. \u201c[We\u2019ll want this to] be something that does end the investment strike and is able to be scaled up into the future as Australia has to lift its level of ambition.\u201d Butler said an LET, or clean energy target, could do that but it was important to get its design right and Labor would consult industry to do so. Asked if the opposition would accept the LET to avoid a scare campaign on power prices against Labor\u2019s policy , Butler said it was responding to the business community saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d and demanding a long-term policy solution. The uncertainty of Australia\u2019s carbon policy has caused reduced investment in electricity generation, including in renewable energy, pushing up prices. Butler said the Business Council of Australia and Australian Industry Group\u2019s support for a LET had been \u201cheavily qualified\u201d. \u201cThey want to see what the design is, they want to ensure this is a long-term enduring framework that will not be up for change after the next election \u2013 that\u2019s what we want as well.\u201d Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt, warned on Tuesday that any new LET cannot be weaker than John Howard\u2019s proposal in 2007, which defined a \u201clow-emissions\u201d energy source as one that emitting fewer than 200kg of greenhouse gas per megawatt of electricity generated. He said if gas and coal-fired power stations qualified as clean energy the government will have \u201ccapitulated to the Trumps\u201d on its backbench. \u201cWe might as well all pack up and go home, because it\u2019s game over for the climate and the planet.\u201d Asked if coal with carbon capture and storage could be part of the mix, Butler said it could be a \u201cvery low carbon source or zero carbon source\u201d but it had not been built at scale anywhere in the world. Last week the Turnbull government began a move to overhaul rules governing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to allow the so-called \u201cgreen\u201d bank to invest in carbon capture and storage technology. Butler said that \u201cin theory\u201d carbon capture and storage could be part of the mix. \u201cThe problem is, though, the government expects a technology that hasn\u2019t even begun to crawl yet suddenly to be foisted upon a bank [the CEFC] that requires a commercial rate of return \u2013 it\u2019s a hollow gesture.\u201d Frydenberg\u2019s advocacy for a new emissions policy and Labor\u2019s openness to a LET come after an internal breakout within the Coalition to follow the US president, Donald Trump, in withdrawing from the Paris climate treaty. Compounding the government\u2019s difficulties, the Minerals Council of Australia has signalled it will oppose a new regulation that would \u201cdeliberately cast aside coal from the energy mix\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
