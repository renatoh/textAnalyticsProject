He raced back to his headquarters in the village of Waterloo and wrote his famous dispatch, explaining just how he had won the battle of Waterloo. \"Waterloo-mania\" swept Britain and huge crowds gathered in London to see Napoleon's captured coach on display (along with the unfortunate coachman), as well as painted panoramas and noisy re-enactments of this great British victory. In 1830, Lieutenant William Siborne, an enthusiastic young artist and cartographer, was commissioned to make a gigantic model for the new United Services Museum. Fanatical about accuracy, he spent eight months surveying the battlefield, convinced his 400 square-foot model would bring him fame, fortune and promotion. But he had to buy his captaincy and died aged 51 in 1849, an impoverished and broken man. Siborne contacted hundreds of veterans to establish precisely what happened, indirectly providing us with what Peter Hofschroer calls \"the most detailed source of information on the battle of Waterloo ever assembled\". He then set about lovingly recreating the scene using card and gum, wire and wood, and cotton wool for the fire and smoke. He even had little paving stones made, as well as 80,000 hand-painted metal soldiers. The attention to detail is remarkable and Siborne's model deserves full appreciation as a work of art. He chose to depict the crisis of the battle - about 7pm on June 18 1815, when Europe's destiny hung in the balance - despite intense pressure from the British establishment to show the position of the armies at the start of the battle. As Wellington's military secretary explained to Siborne: \"I still think that the position you have given to the Prussian troops is not the correct one as regards the moment you wish to represent, and that those who see the work will deduce from it that the result of the Battle was not so much owing to British Valour, and the great Generalship of the Chief of the English Army, as to the flank Movements of the Prussians.\" In his dispatch, Wellington had been adamant it was his attack \"which produced the final result\", but Siborne's model was factually accurate. \"Without Prussian support,\" writes Hofschroer, \"Wellington would have suffered the first defeat of his career and Brussels fallen to the French.\" Some 40,000 Prussians reinforced \"Wellington's crumbling centre\", though the Duke omitted to mention this. More discrepancies arose in the course of Siborne's research. In his dispatch, Wellington had said he was told of the outbreak of hostilities on the evening of the 15th. Privately he said the news came at 3pm. In fact, it was 9am, but he waited for confirmation from Paris that never arrived, thereby losing a vital 24 hours. As a result he let down the Prussians at Ligny on June 16, having promised his support. Wellington naturally wanted to conceal this error of judgment and dismissed Siborne's model as \"all farce, fudge!\", spreading rumours that its creator had been \"humbugged\" by the Prussians and was of \"German descent\". Wellington also claimed to have watched the Prussian defeat at Ligny through his telescope from the crossroads at Quatre Bras. It must have been an \"extraordinary telescope\", wrote Siborne in his History of the War in France and Belgium in 1815 (1844), \"to be able to see through a hill - in the dark\". As if to taunt the Duke even further, he made a second Waterloo model on a larger scale, depicting the Great Cavalry Charge (which goes unmentioned in the dispatch). The 3,000 figures are bigger and more detailed, and Wellington is relegated to the background, far from the action. In the end, Wellington's version prevailed, if only for political reasons. To give credit to Prussia would have upset the balance of power in Europe. Hofschroer himself is no stranger to controversy, having also written The Waterloo Campaign: the German Victory (1999). Some will object to his unflattering portrait of Wellington, but this important book reveals what happens when a loyal subject runs up against an establishment that will stop at nothing to suppress the truth. A not unfamiliar scenario, even today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
