Carol Vorderman,\" reads the marker-pen scrawl on a photograph of the first lady of vowels and consonants herself, plastered on what Topshop Oxford Street's store manager, Sarah Harper, refers to proudly as the shop's hall of fame. It is but a fluorescent stiletto heel's distance from a signed photo of the Spice Girls, one of the boy band Blue (\"Lee was actually very well behaved,\" events co-ordinator Michelle Bonnet says reassuringly) and a decidedly blurry one of a tired and emotional-looking Jamie Theakston. \"Loads of celebrities come in here,\" says Magdalen, one of the store's plethora of smiley shop assistants. \"Gwyneth Paltrow came by - we had to close the store for her.\" Admittedly, the only celebrity in today is Kate Lawler, she of Big Brother \"fame\", for whom they do not have to close the store. At 10am on a grey Wednesday morning, the customers who are slowly swamping the store don't seem overly impressed with Lawler, who continues hunting round the miniskirt section unaccosted. Amanda Stevens, 16, and her friend, Caroline Poole, 15, for example, both down from Guildford for the day, have only one concern. \"Where's the trenches?\" they shout as one, having misguidedly chosen me as their port of call for help. \"The trenches with belts, where are they?\" As a longterm worshipper at the altar of the high street, surely, I naively thought, spending a day working in Topshop's enormous and multitasking (you want a manicure? In the basement, madam! A personal shopper? No problem!) flagship store would be a fairly simple procedure - my natural calling, you could say. And obviously - chortle, chortle - all those improving hours spent staring at fashion magazines have filled my brain with the kind of valuable knowledge that, frankly, should make fielding questions from Topshoppers a veritable doddle: Blockbusters to my Mastermind, I muse smugly, the night before. But Amanda and Caroline don't seem impressed with my years of wisdom. After we stumblingly find said trenches with belts (Topshop's current bestseller), I, donning my best shop-assistant speak, say they look \"great\". \"The shoulders don't fit right, see?\" retorts Amanda, pointing to hitherto invisible creases in the shoulders. \"And the belt's wrong,\" adds Caroline. \"It's too high.\" I've encountered customers of couture with eyes less beady. But if the high-street stores are finding that their customers are rather exacting in their standards, they only have themselves to blame. Much has been written about the recent rise of the high street, as evidenced, more or less, by Topshop's aforementioned hall of fame. The store's 95,000sq ft Oxford Street branch alone has a weekly turnover of \u00a31.5m, and just down the road, New Look has opened a store designed with the kind of flourishes you would expect of an Ian Schrager hotel. This high-street renaissance owes much to, and has contributed to, a change of national attitude about fashion: no longer is it seen as either cringingly frivolous or pretentious (well, not entirely), and rare is the general magazine that doesn't include some fashion. I arrive at Topshop at 10am, where rails of clothes are laid out oh, so temptingly - I feel like Augusta Gloop in Willy Wonka's Fashion Factory. The new autumn collections have begun to arrive and the floors are filled with peacoats, wool miniskirts and houndstooth dresses, all impressively similar to this season's designercollections, particularly such youth-friendly ones as Marc Jacobs and Chlo\u00eb. If the high street has improved by taking catwalk cues, this has only been possible because the catwalk collections themselves have become younger: many designers have launched cheaper diffusion lines, making their clothes accessible to those who are neither grand elderly dowagers, nor have a dowager's bank account. But Jane Shepherdson, Topshop's brand director, says that Topshop is not just about clever \"homages\": \"Direct copies are lazy. We look at how we can make designer trends suitable for our customers.\" Time to staff the changing room. And after a somewhat lengthy lull (customers seem to prefer the changing room guarded by the smiley Topshop professional, not the one with the surly-faced sleepy amateur) a queue of blank-faced teenage girls forms in front of me. I feel like a bouncer at a Westlife concert. They are, almost uniformly, clutching jeans and colourful vest tops. The peacoats and miniskirts are largely ignored by this crowd, who are more intent on resembling their idea of sexy twentysomethings (apparently based on the wardrobe of Hollyoakers), while the twentysomethings, who arrive en masse at lunch time, are dressing like teenagers, flicking through the minidresses and colourful tights. \"Looking like you're wearing Marc Jacobs is more important to the older customer,\" agrees Sarah Harper. \"The younger ones just want to be casual.\" Casual, perhaps, but one of the improvements of the high street has made shoppers more fashion-aware, albeit unknowingly. \"Are these jeans OK?\" Sarah-Jane Parkin, 17, muses, scrutinising her perfectly acceptable (in my opinion) back view in the changing room. \"Too high. Needs to be lower waisted,\" is her friend Laura's verdict. \"Like Seven's, you mean?\" I interject unwisely, citing the fash pack's hipster jeans of choice. \"Like what?\" Laura asks, in a tone that elegantly mixes bafflement with scorn. A few feet away, Lindsey Fielding, 27, sifts through the red minis. Has she been particularly influenced by Marc Jacobs' 60s collection this season? \"A little,\" she shrugs. \"I wouldn't want an exact copy but a take on what's going on.\" It's the afternoon rush and I'm on the tills. You would think with all the practice I have had at purchasing, this part would be like that moment in Harry Potter when he picks out his wand and it just feels right. You might well think that, but you would be wrong. My various failings are quickly brought to my attention (wrong change, surly demeanour, people can be so picky.) Someone points out that my skirt is mucky. However, in the midst of all this fun, one fact emerges: teenagers can shop. The younger the shopper, the more items she buys. A 15 year old will buy five \u00a36 cotton tops and one pair of \u00a330 jeans, whereas the 30 year old will buy two \u00a335 designer-ish A-line skirts. High-street fashion introduces shoppers to the joys of mass consumption at an early age, before later teaching the art of discernment. Or so I - again, with premature smugness - thought. When I arrived I spotted a dress I intended to buy as a treat at the end of the day - very pretty and very this season. But come the afternoon and - horror! - they've all sold out. \"The teenagers love those,\" said Louise Whiting, style adviser, consolingly. \"They've been proving amazingly popular.\" Damn those pesky kids."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
