Ta-ra. Here\u2019s our match report. Williamson returns to do his captain\u2019s interview. He thought the wicket was soft but would harden up and turn into a belter; he was half-right. He praises De Grandhomme for hitting the right areas and building pressure - the slower bowlers were hard to get away, he says - and notes that his attack as a whole did a great job. As for the batting, he says De Grandhomme is an x-factor player who plays his natural game, and delivered a s\u2019perb knock on a big occasion. He says that the pitches in the tournament are all very different and his team aren\u2019t looking around at big scores elsewhere trying to get them they\u2019re just doing that which needs to be done. Du Plessis says South Africa were aiming for 260, and individual batsmen will have regrets. He praises Williamson for showing everyone what to do, problem being you have to be him to do it. He then praises the efforts of his players and notes that they\u2019ve been trying. Nafka mina as the Talmud has it, or practical difference as it\u2019s also known: South Africa are as good as gone with three points from six matches, while New Zealand look a cert for semis with four wins and a no result from five \u2013 they\u2019re top of the pool. They\u2019ll need things to go their way when it comes to it, but Williamson is a matchwinner - he gets man of the match, which is harsh on De Grandhomme but also unarguable. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be there at the end,\u201d says Williamson. I\u2019m sure it is, old mate, I\u2019m sure it is. Imagine that feeling. He then says that the surface was tricky so his team knew it wasn\u2019t over at half-tie, and then says that you know you\u2019re going to face some difficult balls, so building an innings as he did is about seeing out the tough times. Yes they\u2019re both good, but is he the batsman that Joe Root should be? Williamson finishes on 106 not out, Santner on 2. That wasn\u2019t the greatest game I\u2019ve ever seen - let\u2019s be real, a lot of it was dull - but it was tense, dramatic, and settled by a master. We\u2019ve had worse days. 48.3 Williamson glides a single away to third man - another single away to third man - and actually it then becomes four, and that\u2019s that. What a phenomenal performance that is from him, patient, violent and calm. He is already one of the best of his generation, but he\u2019s going to be one of the best of all-time. 48.2 BOW DOWN! WILLIAMSON PICKS THE SLOWER ONE, GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, AND WHACKS THE COVER OFF IT! SIX OVER WIDE MID ON, HIS HUNDRED AS WELL, AND HIS TEAM NEED ONE TO WIN! KANE WILLIAMSON IS A HERO! 48.1 Santner pulls off his hip for one. Seven needed off five. Santner wears glasses. Read into that what you like, but there\u2019s a touch of Clark Kent \u2013 sorry, of the the Clark Kents \u2013 about him. Phehlukwayo has the ball, and along with Du Plessis spends a fair old while setting his field while Ngidi nips off for a slash - it\u2019s that tense. Right, let\u2019s go ball-by-ball. That might help us cope. 48th over (of 49): New Zealand 236-56 (Williamson 96, Santner 1) \u2013 target 242 The batsmen crossed so it\u2019s Williamson on strike ... and he prods at one! Ngidi follows through - he\u2019s not the only one, I\u2019ll wager - but can\u2019t quite reach it. Williamson decides to trust his man so fiddles a single to long on and suddenly you wonder if South Africa might just do this! Ngidi tosses one out wide, nice and gentle, and Santner misses it; 13 needed of 8. This is beautifully tense now, and a thrashed drive hits the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s, turning two into one. Williamson has strike - he\u2019ll want something that gets him down the other end to retain strike, or a boundary. Here comes Ngidi ... and LOOK AT KANE WILLIAMSON! HE IS SO GOOD! He waits for it and glances behind for four! Amazing testicles! Eight needed off of the final over... Well! De Grandhomme has a heave, but the cross-seamer gives him no pace and he picks out the man; there\u2019s no way Du Plessis, at long off, drops this ... and he doesn\u2019t. But why did he do it? he\u2019s played so well, so sensibly, and just needed to knock it about! Game on! 47th over (of 49): New Zealand 228-5 (Williamson 91, De Grandhomme 60) \u2013 target 242. Final shy for South Africa: Rabada returns. It\u2019s hard to see how he can save them here, because he\u2019s got two set batsmen who don\u2019t need to score big - I wonder if, on reflection, Du Plessis regrets keeping his last couple for now. This is a decent over if there\u2019s scoreboard pressure but there isn\u2019t really, and it yields three singles. New Zealand need 14 from 12. 46th over (of 49): New Zealand 225-5 (Williamson 90, De Grandhomme 58) \u2013 target 242. Ngidi returns and diddles Williamson with a slower one, but it\u2019s wafted over midfield for one all the same. Another one follows, into the leg side, then another into the off. So De Grandhomme, looking for a boundary to nail the rate for the over, has a swish at a slower ball and misses - he grins because he can - then swings one high but not hard enough to deep square ... Miller\u2019s chasing in but he can\u2019t quite make up the ground, and there\u2019s that four. Ngidi responds with a wide, then De Grandhomme takes a single. You don\u2019t come across many Colins these days, I wonder if the name is as dead as Gary. \u201cExcellent game described by Abhijato Sensarma,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201cwhich immediately begs the question of what is a par score? I suspect that the optimum approach is a randomised \u2018mixed\u2019 strategy and think this will on average secure a 50 ball innings scoring 160 runs (ignoring extras). But it\u2019s been a very long time since my maths degree days. I think a modified Duckworth Lewis could readily be developed to overcome restricted innings when teacher stops play ...\u201d Er, there\u2019s no such thing as a par score? Every ball on it\u2019s merits, if you can whack it for six you do. 45th over (of 49): New Zealand 216-5 (Williamson 88, De Grandhomme 52) \u2013 target 242. 31 needed off 30 balls - you\u2019re New Zealand, you\u2019d\u2019ve took it, as Ryan Giggs would say. Is there a provision in English for words featuring two contractions? Can we call it a giggstraction? After two dots, a cross-seamer that\u2019s short and wide - Williamson runs it down without having to think, so De Grandhomme thinks he can do likewise and misses ... close. Next, a bazzing yorker that he does really well to handle ... then brings up his fifty with an effortless - for him - swat over wide mid-on for a one-bounce four. That\u2019s brilliant - he\u2019s wearing this pressure like he was sewn into it. 44th over (of 49): New Zealand 211-5 (Williamson 87, De Grandhomme 48) \u2013 target 242. Williamson takes a single, then De Grandhomme has a go at a slower one from Phehlukwayo and edges four - he\u2019s earned all of that with the day he\u2019s had. A single to midwicket them gives Williamson a go, and he pulls for two, after which, hilarity. Williamson swats, Ngidi drops a dolly ... and it\u2019s a no ball anyway. Two more to the total, plus one from the free hit and another one - 12 from the over, barely any risk, and that\u2019s huge at this stage. 43rd over (of 49): New Zealand 199-5 (Williamson 82, De Grandhomme 42) \u2013 target 242. Morris replaces Rabada and hurls himself into it immediately as is his wont. In elegising him, Mark Nicholas praises his chutzpah, pronounced \u201cshutzpah\u201d - someone help him with his Yiddish, please - the ch is guttual. In my lawyering days, someone tried it with a regular ch, then explained what it meant for double points; he also liked F1 but did not like cricket. New Zealand take three from this over, bumping the required rate up to 7.16, but it\u2019s impossible to seethe Saffers winning this unless they get some wickets. 42nd over (of 49): New Zealand 196-5 (Williamson 80, De Grandhomme 41) \u2013 target 242. Phehlukwayo returns, and his team need something, anything. De Grandhomme bangs him to cover for a single and they batsmen take one off each of the next five balls too. There aren\u2019t many men in the world you\u2019d pick ahead of Williamson to shepherd this chase, and he now has 3000 runs in 50-over cricket. 41st over (of 49): New Zealand 190-5 (Williamson 77, De Grandhomme 38) \u2013 target 242. Hi again and thanks Tom. We hoped for an arse-nipper and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got - techno techno techno techno. And this is another terrific over of World Cup CricketTM. Willaimson sneaks a leg bye off Rabada and at short midwicket, Miller has a shy ... they practise for this ... he misses! South Africa have not chapped their chances today, and when you\u2019re defending 241, you have to. Grandhomme then rubs it in by edging a four and knucking a single - what a game he\u2019s having. Brunel, Curie and Aqua have nothing on this tribute to human ingenuity from Abhijato Sensarma: \u201cAs most of the young Indian people like me spend a considerable amount of time in school, and are confined to the four corners of the classroom for most of the school hours\u2019 duration, many innovative ways of playing the sport through strange mediums have been adapted. Without any doubt, the most famous of these adaptations is book cricket, which is usually enjoyed best with a Charles Dickens, much to the disapproval of the English teacher. Then, there is the version of the game which is played with the help of a calculator, much to the disapproval of the mathematics teacher. The most recent reincarnation is \u2018hand cricket,\u2019 which is, not so surprisingly, met with disapproval from all the teachers. The game is pretty basic and can be played anywhere. It requires both of the players to throw down their hands (like rock paper scissors), forming a number with their fingers at the same time. To curb the problem of showing six (which requires both hands to be shown), just the thumb is used. After the toss is conducted using any arbitrary method, the formatting of the game varies greatly, depending on the region and school one is in, like the number of wickets and overs, as well as format. But, as the history teacher often says (albeit during a different discussion), \u2018the basic elements tend to remain same everywhere\u2019. The bowler needs to guess and throw down the same number as the batter. If he does, a dismissal occurs; if not, the number shown by the batsman (ranging from 1 to 6) is added to the total. Be it an international match on the pitch, or a one-wicket-per-side game for winning the rights to pursue a friendship with a common crush, the spirit remains the same. And as every lover of the game knows, it will hurt no one if the core of the game never changes, be it a Test, a T20, or a friendly encounter of \u2018hand cricket\u2019.\u201d 40th over (of 49): New Zealand 184-5 (Williamson 77, De Grandhomme 33) \u2013 target 242. Powerplay three is initiated, and Ngidi returns \u2013 and returns well, varying his pace and movement (and also because his hamstring is a little knacked) and offering nothing. One Williamson single is all it yields. Unmistakeable echoes of NZ\u2019s win over Bangladesh here \u2013 tight in the field, surviving a middle-overs wobble with the bat before easing (ish) home. And with that, I\u2019ll hand you back to Daniel to guide you home. Thanks for your company and emails. 39th over (of 49): New Zealand 183-5 (Williamson 76, De Grandhomme 33) \u2013 target 242. De Grandhomme\u2019s taking this away from South Africa now, he\u2019s onto a short one from Phehlukwayo like a rash and pulls him into the stand for SIX more. He adds another pair of twos. \u201cTom, you posit that South Africa needed a wicket in the next 5 overs, and next minute Neesham is gone,\u201d marvels Danielle Tolson, soliciting lottery number info. \u201cAny other suggestive superpowers you possess may be welcome. I wonder if the Black Caps should have swapped out Henry for Southee &amp; Neesham for Nicholls today given the way the game has played out so far (Mike Hesson recommended this for the game against India that didn\u2019t happen, even just to give them same game time, but might have been more useful for a bunch of reasons in this one).\u201d 38th over (of 49): New Zealand 173-5 (Williamson 76, De Grandhomme 23) \u2013 target 242. Close! De Grandhomme scoops Tahir just short of the man at short midwicket, Miller. And then \u2013 worse! \u2013 a drop, as De Grandhomme similarly misreads and flicks wide of a diving Miller, who can only palm it away. It was a tough chance, but a pivotal one. Tahir finishes with 0-33 from 10 \u2013 an excellent effort. He\u2019s heartily cheered by the crowd. 37th over (of 49): New Zealand 169-5 (Williamson 74, De Grandhomme 21) \u2013 target 242. New Zealand look back on course now. Phehulukwayo returns and De Grandhomme swivels and flicks his second ball into the Hollies Stand \u2013 an easy six. Williamson, meanwhile, can anchor this home now \u2013 as long as his colleagues don\u2019t do anything daft. 36th over (of 49): New Zealand 160-5 (Williamson 72, De Grandhomme 14) \u2013 target 242. Tahir continues, and no boundaries are attempted, but plenty of singles are scurried, one of which almost does for Williamson, who\u2019s almost out off the last ball of the over. Gone if he\u2019d hit. 35th over (of 49): New Zealand 154-5 (Williamson 70, De Grandhomme 10) \u2013 target 242. De Grandhomme drives square for one before Williamson gets hold of one for the first time in a while, a merciless pull to the long-on boundary for four. Kali Srikanth wants to talk tapping: \u201cWell it is the equivalent of tennis players bouncing the balls quintessentially infinite times before serving.It is for the same reason as to \u201cget into a flow/rhythm\u201d or rather a soothing ritual.\u201d So does Olly Horne: \u201cI think tapping the bat is useful for convincing yourself 1) you\u2019re stood in the right place, and 2) your bat isn\u2019t at a funny angle in your hand. That, and at least you\u2019re hitting \u2018something\u2019!\u201d While Howard Roberts at Edgbaston is fulminating against the currently malfunctioning scoreboard. \u201cIf the atmosphere is flat it is because the crowd don\u2019t know the detail of what is happening,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a tight game - unforgivable. Apparently Uber available though.\u201d Well that\u2019s the main thing \u2013 the gig economy purrs on. 34th over (of 49): New Zealand 148-5 (Williamson 65, De Grandhomme 9) \u2013 target 242. It could be a game of attack and counterattack now, a development acknowledged by the return of Tahir from the City End. The batsmen manage to rotate the strike comfortably enough \u2013 three from it. New Zealand need 94 from 15 overs \u2013 more than six an over. 33rd over (of 49): New Zealand 145-5 (Williamson 63, De Grandhomme 8) \u2013 target 242. Williamson drives uppishly at Morris but it falls short of the man at mid-off, and they nab a single, but Morris earns a deserved third wicket when his cross-seamer is edged by the left-hander to Amla, who dives forward to snaffle. De Grandhomme, excellent with the ball earlier, is the new man in though, and he begins with a statement two and a crunching four over midwicket. Two more ensue and this could go any way now. Morris breaks a sticky partnership, edging to Amla who dives low to take it comfortably. And drinks. 32nd over (of 49): New Zealand 136-4 (Williamson 62, Neesham 23) \u2013 target 242. I\u2019d like to see how England get on on a sticky surface like this \u2013 scoring really is easy, and it\u2019s not beyond the bounds that they\u2019d have a Pakistan-in-the-Champions Trophy-style horror show on it, though their attack and tactics are better now than two years ago. Williamson edges, but edges hard, at Phehlukwayo and it careers down to the fine leg boundary for four. Neesham plays his best shot so far too, on-driving a full delivery stylishly for four. A much more productive over \u201cIt is 5 AM on a wintry early morning in Wellington,\u201d scene-sets Hari Shankar. \u201cThe kettle is on. Have the fire going. My dog is staring at me with displeasure. Even the birds are quiet. Nervous start for a lot of kiwis today. Will this go to the wire like that memorable Auckland encounter?\u201d I think it will, yes. Though South Africa need a wicket in the next five overs. 31st over (of 49): New Zealand 125-4 (Williamson 57, Neesham 19) \u2013 target 242. An energetic piece of fielding from Amla denies Williamson a run with a dab to backward point. This is good pressure, and good fielding, and Rabada ends the over with a half-hearted appeal for a catch behind, but the review is spurned. There have been none in this innings. 30th over (of 49): New Zealand 124-4 (Williamson 56, Neesham 19) \u2013 target 242. A breather for Tahir, a return for the mildly inconsistent Phehlukwayo, who begins with a rather rancid wide down legside. Though Williamson struggles a tad to pick his slower ball, and essays a rare and ugly hoik and miss at one of them. Another unconvincing inside-edge brings two. That was Williamson\u2019s least convincing over of his innings \u2013 he didn\u2019t middle anything. 29th over (of 49): New Zealand 119-4 (Williamson 53, Neesham 18) \u2013 target 242. A second spell for Rabada and he begins with a tightish just-back-of-a-length over that goes for two ones and a two. This is going the distance. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d roars Kanishk Srinivasan, \u201cand with a more existential question for you and the OBO-spectators. Why do batsmen tap their bats as the bowler makes their run-up? I watched all my batting heroes do it as I was growing up, so I did the same, but I never actually knew why it was necessary. It came to the point where I found the sound of the tapping bat soothing. I\u2019d be happy with any answers (humorous or informative).\u201d Yep, it was complete orthodoxy, back in the day, though Graham Gooch was my idol as a kid and he had a high tap-less backlift 28th over (of 49): New Zealand 115-4 (Williamson 50, Neesham 17) \u2013 target 242. Neesham takes on Tahir properly for the first time, hitting a half-volley with the spin over midwicket for four, and Williamson moves to a vital half-century by the time the over\u2019s done. Does anyone make batting look so easy? A touch of flamboyance reported by Aditi Prabhudesai \u201cApropos of nothing [is anything ever \u201capropos of something\u201d - OBO ed], yesterday during the match footage was shown of a man, clad in black, knee-deep in pumping out push-ups. His face was hidden. When he finally got up, lo and behold it was Bruce Oxenford. The conscience was suitably pricked. Also, watching Oxenford without his Perspex appendage is like watching Nick Fury without his eye-patch.\u201d 27th over (of 49): New Zealand 109-4 (Williamson 47, Neesham 12) \u2013 target 242. Ngidi is doing a really important job here, denying New Zealand an end from which they can cut loose. Two singles and a neat clip through midwicket from a well-read slower ball complete the over. 26th over (of 49): New Zealand 105-4 (Williamson 46, Neesham 11) \u2013 target 242. Tahir ties Neesham in venture-scout standard knots with a devilish off-break which whistles past the left-hander. It\u2019s the highlight of another parsimonious over. It was always bound to happen. Alastair Horne nominates \u201cthe Australians finally getting caught\u201d as his moment of the decade. Say Alastair, have you met my good friend Russell? 25th over (of 49): New Zealand 103-4 (Williamson 45, Neesham 10) \u2013 target 242. An excellent maiden. Ngidi flummoxes Williamson with an in-swinging slower ball that brushes past the batsman\u2019s midriff. It\u2019s followed by a smattering of good shots for no run. South Africa have four men in on the one on the offside, and they\u2019re all stopping runs. We\u2019re halfway through New Zealand\u2019s reply and they\u2019re not in Bon Jovi territory yet. Validation from our man Abhijato, re Perera: \u201cI agree with you, Tom. This is the perfect definition as well as representation of cricket from the past decade - the guts, the glory, the upsets, the resurgence of Test cricket, and the perennial joy of being the viewer in the background as your heroes pull off impossible feats. What a beautiful sport this is!\u201d That it is. 24th over (of 49): New Zealand 103-4 (Williamson 45, Neesham 10) \u2013 target 242. Tahir treats himself to a celebrappeal against Neesham, but De Kock cautions that it pitched outside leg, which it did. It\u2019s all pressure though, as is the fine stop at extra-cover that denies a crunching Neesham drive a run. Just the one from the spinner\u2019s fifth over. 23rd over (of 49): New Zealand 102-4 (Williamson 44, Neesham 10) \u2013 target 242. Ngidi replaces Morris after a superb spell from the latter. Strike rotation takes New Zealand into three figures, but Ngidi offers no freebies. Five singles. India news: Dhawan is officially out of the World Cup \u2013 a horrible blow for him and India, though no team probably has more batting depth. Rishabh Pant is confirmed as the replacement. 22nd over (of 49): New Zealand 97-4 (Williamson 41, Neesham 8) \u2013 target 242. This is a high-calibre battle: one of the wiliest spinners in the world against one of the most accomplished batsmen. Williamson is being pretty respectful, though you wonder whether Neesham\u2019s more the type to go \u2018what the hell\u2019 and try to launch it. No sign of it yet, though. A watchful three from the over. 21st over (of 49): New Zealand 94-4 (Williamson 39 Neesham 7) \u2013 target 242. Williamson attempts to reassert himself with a lovely on-drive for four and the runs flow a bit more freely again after the recent mood-changing jitters. The next dozen or so overs could decide this match. It\u2019s beautifully poise. I\u2019m wary of saying \u201cintriguing\u201d because that smacks a little too much, in cricket parlance, of \u201cNothing much is happening but it\u2019s fascinating, honest.\u201d It is fascinating, mind. 20th over (of 49): New Zealand 86-4 (Williamson 33 Neesham 5) \u2013 target 242. \u201cNow that the format-talk has been guillotined,\u201d writes Surendranath Halder, \u201clet us discuss something else - what is the most iconic cricketing moment of this decade so far? For me, it was Dhoni\u2019s World Cup winning six. What about you, as well as others?\u201d To be Anglo-centric I might go for Stokes at Cape Town in 2016, or perhaps Perera\u2019s remarkable, unforeseen match-winning turn for Sri Lanka in South Africa earlier this year. Tahir sends down another very tidy over, that yields only two singles. 19th over (of 49): New Zealand 84-4 (Williamson 32 Neesham 0) \u2013 target 242. The tables continue to turn as the left-handed Latham edges behind to become the third wicket to fall for eight runs. He has the incoming left-hander, Jimmy Neesham, in trouble straight away with another teasing away swinger slanted across him. It\u2019s a seamer\u2019s paradise at the moment, though Neesham likes to have a go and is offered room to square-drive for four, which he does. \u201cCan something be high on quality, intriguing, as well as boring, often simultaneously?\u201d asks OB Jato, speaking my language. \u201cBecause going by what we\u2019ve seen so far in this paradoxical World Cup, that is exactly what could happen over the next few weeks!\u201d Again! South Africa are in the ascendancy now \u2013 Morris hits the corridor of uncertainty with unerring menace and Latham edges limply behind. 18th over (of 49): New Zealand 80-3 (Williamson 32 Latham 1) \u2013 target 242. Williamson edges wide of slip for four as Tahir finds deceptive loop and bounce, and the captain was pretty discomfited by that. And also by another tossed-up googly outside off that he swishes at and misses. This is compelling stuff. Four from the over, but Tahir won\u2019t mind too much about that. 17th over (of 49): New Zealand 76-3 (Williamson 28, Latham 1) \u2013 target 242. And another! Morris changes ends and induces a lazy flick to the keeper from Taylor. Encouraging for the quick bowler, who sends down a fine probing over locating movement and swing, and for Tahir, who has something to aim at at the other end. A change of ends for Morris, and another change of luck. He strangles Taylor down the legside and a potential matchwinner is back in the shed. Do we have a game now? 16th over (of 49): New Zealand 74-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 1) \u2013 target 242. Time for Tahir, not without reason. The spinner comes on at the City End but Ross Taylor is at him smartly, advancing to get off the mark before it bounces. But a textbook googly has Williamson in bother as he dobs it uppishly back to the bowler but the ball drops just short of him. An encouraging sttart. 15th over (of 49): New Zealand 72-2 (Williamson 26) \u2013 target 242. Phehlukwayo overpitches, Williamson punishes, with an effortless cover drive to the boundary, and then makes it eight from two with an emphatic swivel-pull. This is costly for South Africa \u2013 but then they get a freakish stroke of luck, as Guptill treads on his stumps. In true union conference style, we\u2019re going to guillotine the format debate now and ask the proposer to offer his right of reply. Over to you Abhijato: The format was just an abstract idea I had over dinner a few days ago, and I am overwhelmed by the reaction. Here I go, then, to add a few points of my own to some of the correspondence - Both Nick and Kanishk have pointed out quite a valid cause for concern. I was trying to tie-in the overall spirit of the ODI World Championship (first edition starts from later this year) with the World Cup better than the current form of its existence. The teams in G1 would have played the best cricket and are merely getting rewarded now for their consistency over the last four years. As for the matches being semi-conscious, it\u2019s a valid concern. The same phenomenon might happen in this 2019 edition, since qualification is almost secure for the top four halfway through. But the incentive of getting the best spots for the knockouts will mean quality matches are still played. Also, many thanks to Mr Baxter. He is indeed right about the typo, as well as the format. Even I myself am not sure about this! What a strange one. Guptill rocks back to pull into the onside, but then slides backwards as he sets off for the run and careers into his stumps. He\u2019d looked totally unperturbed until then. 14th over (of 49): New Zealand 61-1 (Guptill 35, Williamson 15) \u2013 target 242. Morris sends a beautiful outswinger off the seam and past Williamson\u2019s outside edge, before a bit of sloppiness on the boundary from Rabada turns a one into a two. 13th over (of 49): New Zealand 58-1 (Guptill 33, Williamson 14) \u2013 target 242. Guptill on-drives Phehlukwayo without middling, and the ball runs away for four. Mark Nicholas in the commentary box reckons there\u2019s not much in it, but until wickets come, it\u2019s advantage New Zealand. \u201cCan you give Julian Menz (over 11) off for bunching Afghanistan and Bangladesh together with a rather insulting \u201c/\u201d,\u201d snorts Damian Burns. \u201cThe two teams are worlds apart as demonstrated by their quite differing performances in this competition.\u201d To be fair, I think he was talking Bangladesh sides of yore, though they\u2019ve been beating the big boys for 20 years now. 12th over (of 49): New Zealand 53-1 (Guptill 29, Williamson 13) \u2013 target 242. South Africa have kept it tight but these batsmen don\u2019t look in too much bother and the ever-unruffled Williamson drives Morris down the ground for four. There could have been another when Williamson pulls firmly across the line but Van du Dussen continues his distinguished day with a good stop in front of the ropes. These sorts of low-thrumming scoreboard-nudging overs suit the Kiwis just fine. 11th over (of 49): New Zealand 46-1 (Guptill 27, Williamson 8) \u2013 target 242. Another like for like change: Phehlukwayo for Rabada. Three singles on the offside ensue. \u201cGood afternoon/evening from sunny Sweden Tom,\u201d says Julian Menz. \u201cThanks to you and your colleagues for the OBOs. No live coverage here, kid (Molly, 4 years old. Teaching her cricket, a life-skill that will prove invaluable growing up in Scandinavia), \u00a38/pint etc. I have to disagree with Uma (4th over). The gap is far from unbridgable. The \u2018lesser\u2019 teams have come up with some solid performances during this WC. The semi-finalists might seem pre-ordained now, but the bigger picture is far from clear. Should the West Indies/SA/Sri Lanka now be considered minnows? Would England pre-Morgan and his merry band of bashers have beaten the current Afghanistan/Bangladesh teams?\u201d My estimations? In 99, no; in 2003 yes; 2007 - no; 2011 - no; 2015 - Nooooooo! 10th over (of 49): New Zealand 43-1 (Guptill 26, Williamson 6) \u2013 target 242. The first bowling change sees Chris Morris on for Ngidi, and Guptill flat-bats him over cover for two. Morris isn\u2019t happy with the scuffed state of of the bowling crease and the groundsman is summoned forth for a spot of ad-hoc gardening. But there are no other scoring shots in the over, and there\u2019s a bit of a Test match vibe to proceedings at the moment. South Africa will be cautiously pleased with how they\u2019ve started, as powerplay one comes to a close \u2013 more wickets required though Here\u2019s Mark Ireland with what might be my favourite new format suggestion thus far: \u201cTwo groups of eight (thus allowing minor nations) Only the top two teams go through to quarter finals (making each game count)The bottom two teams go outThe middle four teams in each group play off against each other (call it a wild card round) with the winners joining the top teams in the quarter finals.Straight knockout from then on. A \u201cmajor\u201d team would need to be truly awful to not even make the wild card round, and the \u201cminor\u201d teams still have a good chance to get through to a knockout game. Sounds good to me (well, obviously).\u201d 9th over (of 49): New Zealand 41-1 (Guptill 24, Williamson 6) \u2013 target 242. Williamson pushes Rabada away for three. The rest of the over is lean and tight, and yields just one more. These batsman aren\u2019t forcing it at this point (though they don\u2019t need to), though South Africa are keeping them honest. Here\u2019s a format idea from Sean Cunningham: \u201cUsing the ranking to create groups would not be all bad. However, there is a need for a 16th team to make it all work. At the beginning of the competition groups are made up as follows: Rankings, 1, 8, 9 and 16 Rankings 2, 7,10 and 15 Rankings 3,6,11 and 14 Rankings 4 ,5, 12 and 13 Round robin to order each group then a further 4 rounds to the final. Round 1: A1 vs D4 (E), A2 vs D3 (F), A3 vs D2 (G), A4 vs D1 (H), B1 vs C4 (I), B2 vs C3 (J), B3 vs C2 (K), B4 vs C1 (L). QF: E vs J (M), F vs K (N), G vs L (O), H vs I (P): SF: M vs P (Q), N vs O. Final P vs Q. 27 Matches total\u201d And here\u2019s Kevin Sims: \u201cAs a replacement for Net Run Rate, why not make use of DRS reviews. DRS review rate would be successful reviews minus unsuccessful reviews.\u201d Hmm. NRR is a fairly important gauge of all-round one-day skills. 8th over (of 49): New Zealand 37-1 (Guptill 23, Williamson 3) \u2013 target 242. This is a good surface to bowl on if you mix your lengths up a little and don\u2019t stray too wide. Ngidi finds the right balance with some good in-the-blockhole bowling that Guptill can\u2019t work away until he nonchalantly flicks the final ball of the over over extra cover for four Our email server is currently straining on the weight of all your CWC format suggestions \u2013 it\u2019s a subject over which we will wrangle at least three times longer than we do over Brexit. I\u2019ll try to come to some of them in due course. But there\u2019s heartbreaking news for Justin Horton, as Tor Turner fesses up to a bum steer. \u201cScratch that, it wasn\u2019t released until 2003. I was a lad then but Twitter reliably informs me Justin was not. Sorry mate! Turns out, pretty popular topic for books about football. Ah bugger it made it in before I could send this. Oh well, thanks for the mention.\u201d 7th over (of 49): New Zealand 32-1 (Guptill 19, Williamson 3) \u2013 target 242. Rabada puts the schackles back on, accurate and just back of a length for the most part. Only one run from the over, a flick to midwicket for one from Guptill. \u201cI found Justin Horton\u2019s book,\u201d yelps Tor Turner. \u201cI reckon it\u2019s \u2018The Stretford Enders\u2019 by Trevor Colgan \u2013 it\u2019s a trilogy, in the last book he knackers his leg and his girlfriend leaves him to run off to London. Not right world class reading but I remember picking it out of the school library when I was a lad.\u201d 6th over (of 49): New Zealand 32-1 (Guptill 18, Williamson 3) \u2013 target 242. Guptill will punish anything overpitched, which he does first by summarily dismissing him through midwicket for four. And when Ngidi overpitches twice more, Guptill creams two more boundaries straight past him. The shackles come off. John Starbuck writes in to brag that all this Michael Hardcastle stuff was before his time. \u201cI got most of my sports stories from the Rover, the Wizard etc. but this might help:\u201d 5th over (of 49): New Zealand 19-1 (Guptill 5, Williamson 3) \u2013 target 242. De Kock fumbles after Williamson turns Rabada round the corner, but he does enough to slow the speed of the ball and ensure it\u2019s two rather than four. Rabada then sends a jaffer jagging past Williamson\u2019s outside edge \u2013 some encouraging shape and line there. South Africa are bowling well in the main. 4th over (of 49): New Zealand 17-1 (Guptill 5, Williamson 1) \u2013 target 242. Ngidi has a persistent lbw shout after thudding into a driving Guptill, but Du Plessis declines, rightly, to send it upstairs. It was high and wide down legside. It\u2019s a very good over \u2013 varied and accurate. South Africa, and maybe the tournament, need more like this. \u201cThe problem with cricket is that it is like Formula One,\u201d reckons Uma Venkatraman, contentiously, \u201cno matter what format you adopt, the gulf between the top and the bottom is unbridgeable; maybe there should be a reserve group of players from various countries who are in the squad but didn\u2019t make it to the playing 11 of their teams. The weaker teams such as Afghanistan or say Ireland or Scotland (if they are included), even Bangladesh - though I hesitate now to call them weak - should be allowed to pick up to three players from the reserve group for their teams. That will give them some necessary firepower and may get them an upset victory or two.\u201d 3rd over (of 49): New Zealand 15-1 (Guptill 3, Williamson 1) \u2013 target 242. Just what South Africa need \u2013 the early scalp of Munro, who\u2019d looked in the mood. Williamson is off the mark with a push through midwicket for one, and Rabada can\u2019t quite maintain the pressure or the rhythm for the remainder of the over, which includes the second wide of the innings. New Zealand sent down only four in the Proteas\u2019 49 overs at the crease. \u201cTrying to get my head around Abhijato Sensarma\u2019s proposed format and I think I\u2019m being stymied by a typo,\u201d writes Jim Baxter. \u201cIn the third paragraph, where it says, \u2018QF4: G1 third runners-up v G2 fourth runners-up\u2019, shouldn\u2019t that be \u2018G1 third runners-up v *G1* fourth runners-up\u2019? \u2026 Either way, I still have no idea whether I think it\u2019s a good idea or not.\u201d Vital early strike. Rabada hurries up Munro from round the wicket, and he edges into his pads and up for the bowler to lunge forward and take a fine return catch. 2nd over (of 49): New Zealand 12-0 (Guptill 2, Munro 9) \u2013 target 242. Ngidi sends down a promising opening over, beating Guptill outside off with a tricky lifter. A legside wide undermines it a little but the bowler found the right lengths there. Nick Parish has views on formats: \u201cSurely the big problem with this suggestion is the huge number of dead (or at least, semi-conscious) matches. Everyone in G1 qualifies, so you have 10 matches on which all that hangs is the position in which they qualify \u2013 which is a nice-to-have, but wouldn\u2019t create the same amount of real tension as if they were playing for whether they qualified. Similarly only one team qualifies in G3 so as soon as any team loses two matches it also loses all interest in the tournament. I can\u2019t do any better in coming up with the right answer, but this isn\u2019t it.\u201d So does Kanishk Srinivasan: \u201cRegarding Abhijato\u2019s format for the World Cup, I think issues could also come up with the fact that all the teams in G1 (top five ranked teams) get a guaranteed position in the knockout phase. Apart from positions in the group table and the spirit of the competition, that could mean that they end up taking the matches in the round-robin phase for granted, and that wouldn\u2019t really make for fun viewing either if we knew they\u2019d all get through. Plus, fewer top-five teams could make the knockouts much more competitive. So maybe 3 from G1, 3 from G2 and 2 from G1 to go through to the quarter finals?\u201d My head\u2019s starting to hurt. 1st over (of 49): New Zealand 9-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 8) \u2013 target 242. South Africa need to attack from the off here, which is not something they\u2019ve done particularly well thus far, and New Zealand get above the rate straight away. Rabada opens up from the Pavilion End, with two slips in. Guptill clips a single to get on the scoreboard but Munro isn\u2019t hanging about \u2013 he rarely does \u2013 and flays his first ball through the covers for four, and pushes the next through the same area for another boundary. That was an impeccable piece of timing and placement. The players are back out \u201cTom, why not adopt the americas cup format for the cricket world cup?\u201d asks Ken McMahon. I can think of a few but do go on: \u201cThe defending champ decides where to hold the event and what the rules are. Could be a lot of carbon fiber bats and high tech accessories involved. Also the balls light up as well as the bails. Then each team selects the best players they can afford from whichever country they come from, but they represent the country that pays. Then all challengers have a knock out series to decide who plays in the best of 9 final against the defender who has been able to watch them all play and prepare a strategy at leisure. I think this looks a pretty fair sort of format!\u201d Well it\u2019s bold, but surely skewed even more in favour of the richest than the current format. I therefore expect the ICC to adopt it for 2023 at their earliest convenience. Mid-innings reading, in case you missed it earlier. Some deflating news for India (and the tournament): And some bold speaking of brains by Russell Cunningham: An email from, would you believe, Abhijato Sensarma, who\u2019s probably assembled more words on this World Cup than our entire cricket desk put together. I would like to present my (rather radical) World Cup format once again to get your thoughts about it: Top ten teams according to ODI rankings will be divided into two groups of five teams each. Teams ranked 1-5 occupy G1 and teams ranked 5-10 occupy G2. Top five teams from Qualifying Tournament occupy G3. Each team plays others in its group once. All teams of G1 will qualify for the Knockouts (a reward for overall excellent form over the last four years), top two teams will qualify from G2, and the group winner will qualify from G3. The quarter finals happen after the round-robin fixtures are over. QF1: G1 winner v G3 winner; QF2: G1 first runners-up v G2 first runners-up; QF3: G1 second runners-up v G2 winner; QF4: G1 third runners-up v G2 fourth runners-up. SF1: QF1 winner v QF4 winner; SF2: Q2 winner v Q3 winner. Final: SF1 winner v SF2 winner. This format does what the ODI Championship seeks to do in a more concrete manner - make all matches played in the four-year-cycle relevant. Teams will be motivated to perform since being in G1 gives secure qualification to the Knockouts. 37 matches played overall, with Big Three getting 5 guaranteed matches. Your take on the matter? It\u2019s a bit too Uefa Nations League for my jaded palate, a bewildering format that always makes me think of this. But you\u2019ve put some proper thought into the quarter-final format, which makes it better than the shall-we/shan\u2019t-we-take-it-seriously football tournament. Though I\u2019m wary of enshrining The Big Three as a defined entity with Needs, that must be met in some way. New Zealand still haven\u2019t conceded a 250+ score in this tournament yet. Bowling first every time for them appears to have worked a dream, though it might leave them a tad untested in certain batting areas when tougher tests arrive (and they had some nervy moment against Bangladesh), but they\u2019ve been on top in this game pretty much from the off. But \u2026 but \u2026 it doesn\u2019t look an easy pitch to bat on, and if South Africa can take some early wickets we could have a proper contest. \u201cIf people are doing Michael Hardcastle,\u201d says Justin Horton, \u201ccan anybody else remember the one where the hero breaks his leg at the end, and his girlfriend leaves him, suggesting he find somebody who likes football? I recall the plot, but the name of the book completely escapes me.\u201d Football and heartbreak there, the closest of bedfellows, as ever. Anyone? 49th over: South Africa 241-6 (Van der Dussen 67, Morris 6). Ferguson bowls the final over, the first ball of which is top-edged by Morris over the keeper for four \u2013 if you\u2019re gonna hook, hook hard. A miscue to mid-off from a well-disguised slower cutter brings a single before Van der Dussen clatters a long-hop over long-on for a cleanly struck SIX, and follows it with a lofted straight drive for four off the final ball of the over. South Africa scrambled 53 from the final five. It\u2019s probably not enough but could have been a lot lower. Ferguson finishes with three for 59 from 10. 48th over: South Africa 226-6 (Van der Dussen 57, Morris 1). \u201cSA batsmen are playing some great one day cricket here if, um, we somehow went through a time warp and travelled back to 1992,\u201d mocks Fran\u00e7ois Badenhorst. \u201cHow very dare you sir,\u201d retorts Van der Dussen, pulling Henry over deep square leg for SIX, and then almost perishing playing the same shot next ball \u2013 but Ferguson spills what doesn\u2019t look too difficult a chance. It\u2019s waist-high by the time it reaches him but it goes in and out of the hand. I\u2019d have probably dropped it, mind. The rest of the over, with pace taken off a tad, is a bit more problematic for the batsmen. Eight from it isn\u2019t enough at this stage. One to come. 47th over: South Africa 218-6 (Van der Dussen 50, Morris 0). Van der Dussen brings up a hardfought 50, from 56 balls, with a nudge off his hips from Ferguson, who gets carried away next ball by bouncing Phehlukwayo for his first ball. It\u2019s a wide. But the new man can\u2019t get hold of it, swinging and missing at Ferguson\u2019s next ball, then swinging and connecting but only dollying it up to Williamson at mid-off. Easy. The new man Morris, who can hit the cricket ball hard, can\u2019t get bat on cricket ball for two deliveries nor score off the third. Ferguson has a third, the new man \u2013 never comfortable \u2013 mistiming an uppish hoik to mid-off. 46th over: South Africa 216-5 (Van der Dussen 49, Phehlukwayo 0). Boult goes short at Van der Dussen, hemming him in effectively, and also giving him some grief as he top edges a hook into his grill. The physio comes on to give him the once-over, but a check and some new gloves and he\u2019s ready to resume. So ready that he cracks the very next ball straight past the bowler for four. Six from the over. Some earlier highbrow lit chat \u2013 the reprise. \u201cMichael Hardcastle,\u201d exclaims Nick Parish. \u201cGood Lord, there\u2019s a blast from the past. Always felt his books had no proper climax and fizzled out. Did you ever read the Napper McCann series by Martin Waddell? They were really terrific \u2013 and with lots of pictures of the action that made you want to smash your pillow into the corner of the duvet.\u201d Alas I never did, probably to my folks\u2019 relief on bed-changing day. 45th over: South Africa 210-5 (Van der Dussen 44, Phehlukwayo 0). Ferguson \u2013 one of the sleeper hits of this World Cup \u2013 returns from the City End \u2013 and gets some treatment at last. Two fours \u2013 a controlled pull and a flick to fine leg \u2013 start the over. Having been jinxed by my singing of his praises, Ferguson\u2019s radar is a little off here, but no matter \u2013 he gets a wicket, when Miller perishes forcing the pace, which he probably had to do. Kitchen sinks need to be hurled at each of these remaining four overs now. Miller slaps two fours to start the over, but then holes out with an upper cut to deep backward point and Boult runs round to gather well. 44th over: South Africa 198-4 (Van der Dussen 41, Miller 27). Miller flicks a low Boult full-toss to the deep midwicket boundary for two, which is followed by a run-out review, with Van der Dussen having to dive home at the non-striker\u2019s end after Miller had slapped to Williamson at point. He\u2019s in. Another risky single \u2013 testament to South Africa\u2019s nervy frustration \u2013 would have led to a definite run-out had Santner\u2019s throw not been awry. But \u2026 frustraton schmustration: Miller belts a Boult half-volley over wide long-on for another of those SIXES, that they have now. South Africa\u2019s hopes of scrambling a chaseable score in the next five over weigh heavily on the left-hander\u2019s shoulders. 43rd over: South Africa 187-4 (Van der Dussen 40, Miller 17). Afternoon everyone. Thanks Dan, Tom taking over for the rest of this innings and the bulk of New Zealand\u2019s, though it may not last long. What a tight, canny side the Black Caps are. Henry continues and Miller tries to take on the short ball with a swish across the line \u2026 through to the keeper it goes. It\u2019s another boundary-free over. Four singles from it. 42nd over: South Africa 183-4 (Van der Dussen 39, Miller 15) As I was saying, Van der Dussen has had enough, and bends down low to cream Santner over long off for six. But he and Miller can only find three singles thereafter, so that\u2019s enough of me - here\u2019s Tom Davies to coax you through onslaught. 41st over: South Africa 173-4 (Van der Dussen 36, Miller 14) Matt Henry returns after his opening spell and one can only conclude that this pitch is a cad. The batsmen add three singles and a leg bye, and there\u2019s no reason to think they can turn this up significantly because they\u2019ve been trying to for a while - 220 looks about right from here. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Kanishk has the rules of book cricket completely wrong,\u201d says Matt Brown. \u201cOpen book at the random page - check. Count up letters in words - check. But monstrous scores are unlikely because if the word starts with \u2018b\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, \u2018s\u2019, \u2018l\u2019 or \u2018r\u2019 then you\u2019re out. H for hit wicket, handled ball or hit bat twice just tilted it too much towards the bowlers. So, some mighty collapses happened! Mind you, maybe this is why India racked up huge scores while England collapsed like a deck of cards throughout the 1980s and 1990s!\u201d The Matt Brown, I trust. 40th over: South Africa 169-4 (Van der Dussen 28, Miller 12) \u201cSqueeze here!\u201d shouts Williamson as Santner returns, and squeeze he does, a single forced down the ground by Miller the first run from the over, from its fifth ball. Van der Dussen then pushes to mid off, and that\u2019s yer lot. That was a powerplay over, by the way, because this is a 49-over a side game, because, well you know the answer to that one and it\u2019s not rain. 39th over: South Africa 166-4 (Van der Dussen 26, Miller 11) Boult returns and Van der Dussen whacks through cover, only for Munro to shark around the rope, dive, and save the four. New Zealand\u2019s ground-fielding has been excellent today, and he\u2019s at it again when Miller hits to midwicket. 38th over: South Africa 159-4 (Van der Dussen 22, Miller 8) Ferguson continues as commentary discusses the pitch not being such a belter after all - the groundsman told Mark Nicholas that it\u2019s the hardest he\u2019s ever had to prepare, given the presence of rain and absence of sun, a pin-sharp metaphor for the state of things round this way. Two singles and a wide from the over, and where, exactly, is this going? Maybe someone will play a shot once they\u2019ve seen the shine off. 37th over: South Africa 156-4 (Van der Dussen 21, Miller 8) De Grandhomme panels in for the last over of what\u2019s been an excellent spell; Miller gets under him to loft over mid off, but Henry runs it down and they run three. Four singles follow and that\u2019s a bit better, but 156-4 is at this stage is very curious. Someone needs to tell Van der Dussen that the ball cussed his mum down; De Grandhomme finishes with 1-33 off his 10. 36th over: South Africa 149-4 (Van der Dussen 19, Miller 2) We\u2019re shown some rough on the pitch that might appeal to Imran Tahir and repel New Zealand\u2019s lefties, but South Africa have a lot of work to do to make it even halfway relevant. In the meantime, Ferguson stomps in as pace and the batsmen can find only singles, a ball with extra bounce caressing Miller\u2019s back arm a right sair yin. Welcome to the match, old mate! 35th over: South Africa 145-4 (Van der Dussen 17, Miller 1) De Grandhomme continues and concedes five. The attack is on! \u201cWe never played car cricket in Indian schools,\u201d laments Kanishk Srinivasan, but book cricket was quite the popular sport. We\u2019d flip the pages of our Chemistry/Physics/other seemingly irrelevant subjects textbooks and stop at a random page and add the numbers to create monstrous scores. Wickets fell if the last digit of the page number was zero. All done under the negligent eye of our teachers who weren\u2019t bothered enough to see what the backbenchers in a class of 50+ students were up to. Needless to say, I had never found Science textbooks more useful until we discovered those games. Once in a while, the less clever kids were caught and after a fair number of warnings, were also given a day off from school to reflect on their sins, which they ended up using to come up with more interesting games and ways to avoid the attention of the more proactive teachers.\u201d 34th over: South Africa 138-4 (Van der Dussen 12, Miller 1) Yet another quiet one, just three from it. Drinks, and someone should give the batsmen a livener. Which seamless segue leads us to... \u201cAre you still doing keys stories?\u201d asks Tom Whitehead, \u201cor has the mood moved on? During an evening of relentless refreshment with a cricketing pal, I once ended up with the keys to a certain Sports Bar in London\u2019s West End, We arrived at the bar after closing time to find the place deserted, the front door ajar and the keys dangling in the lock. Gripped by a tipsy sense of public duty we let ourselves in to \u201ckeep an eye on the place in case anyone else let themselves in to cause trouble\u201d. Naturally we took the opportunity to \u201csee if the Ashes Test was on the telly\u201d as England were down under at the time. Of course we totally failed to work the fiendishly complicated multi-screen audio-visual system. We may not have even been on the right night to see any cricket anyway. We did manage to enjoy a couple of pints of cooking lager and a large dram (which we paid for of course) before we were unceremoniously scuffled out by the manager when we went looking for munchies in the kitchen and discovered him playing a rather serious-looking game of cards with the kitchen staff.\u201d This should be on the syllabus for any citizenship test. 33rd over: South Africa 135-4 (Van der Dussen 10, Miller 0) I wonder if Markram is quite ready for this. Perhaps he needs to establish himself in Tests, then move over to limited overs because as well as not finding the big shots, he wasn\u2019t really keeping the scoreboard ticking. South Africa are in shtuck! Markram swipes at one, slices, and Munro ambles in off the fence to take a simple enough catch. Hansom cab for the Proteas! 32nd over: South Africa 135-3 (Markram 38, Van der Dussen 8) Boult takes the ball, looking to avenge himself, except Markram flows him through the covers for four. He\u2019s a lovely player and quickly goes again, flashing hard, but this time picking out the sweeper as they run one. Two singles and a wide follow and I know South Africa need to win this but they\u2019re playing not to lose. \u201cMyself and three other fifth years were passing a lunch break in a deserted maths room,\u201d reflexive pronouns Greg Phillips. \u201cA passing science teacher (nicknamed Ming the Merciless, both for his ruthlessness and his resemblance to Max Von Sydow\u2019s Ming in the incomparable Queen-soundtracked film from 1980) poked his head through the doorway and reminded us we were not supposed to be there. As he left, I raised my hand and extended my middle finger, tracking his imagined path on the other side of the wall. Then I looked back at the doorway, hand and finger still in the air, and there he was, having returned to make a follow-up point. I was so guilty, so caught, and so dead. After what seemed like forever but was probably two seconds, he shook his head sadly and left. Almost 30 years later, I am still mildly surprised I lived to share this anecdote. 31st over: South Africa 127-3 (Markram 33, Van der Dussen 6) De Grandhomme returns and Markram tries to get things moving, swiping to deep square, and running in off the fence, Boult, inexplicably, jumps into the catch, knocking the ball with his hand as a consequence before finding himself unable to regather because he\u2019s in mid-air. Whoops. They run one, then add one more and two leg byes. 30th over: South Africa 123-3 (Markram 32, Van der Dussen 5) Santner tosses one up to Markram outside off, and he\u2019s having no such thing, cleansing him through cover point for four. Van der Dussen then turns one away fine for two and that\u2019s a bit better from South Africa. They used to say that you double the score at 30 to get an idea of what a team\u2019ll get after 50 - there\u2019s no way that\u2019ll be enough here. 29th over: South Africa 115-3 (Markram 27, Van der Dussen 2) The pace of Lockie Ferguson is not really what you want when you\u2019re a middle-order batsman looking to play yourself in but with runs needed quickly. But that\u2019s what Rassie van der Dussen has got, and he quickly gets down the other end thanks to a leg bye. The batsmen then swap singles, and this is great for New Zealand. \u201cShould Chris Morris come in next with a brief to play a T20 innings,\u201d asks Gary Naylor. \u201cIn that format, he strikes at 150+, so (say) 40 off 25 balls would transform this innings. As it is, he\u2019ll come in at 8 either in a collapse or without time to make an impact. A wasted asset.\u201d Yes, South Africa are getting to that point - when the scorecard came up, I was looking at how they might rearrange to get things moving before they\u2019re got moving, and that\u2019s one way. 28th over: South Africa 112-3 (Markram 26, Van der Dussen 1) Van der Dussen gets off the mark with a single. Drat and double drat. Trouble for South Africa! Santner coaxes turn from a full one that pitches middle, as Amla looks to play a run-down; he misses and loses his off bail! That a really good ball - the bounce was what killed the batsman there. 28th over: South Africa 110-2 (Amla 55, Markram 25) Santner has 0-20 off five; this platform has gone up more slowly than Wembley Stadium. 27th over: South Africa 107-2 (Amla 55, Markram 22) Talking of sportsfolk\u2019s phrase making, as we were, Mark Nicholas has just noted that Lockie Ferguson - who\u2019s back on - \u201cbowls a fast cricket ball\u201d. NFL types never call the the ball \u201cthe ball\u201d, it\u2019s always \u201cthe football\u201d; is this to somehow assert extra and specific importance via an official, formal title? Markram takes two into the off side, then Amla drops and runs. A wide and further single follow. 26th over: South Africa 102-2 (Amla 54, Markram 19) This is a belting spell from Santner, who\u2019s just turned Markram into a cat. Sorry, I\u2019m currently reading the Worst Witch series, which isn\u2019t bad though not up there with Michael Hardcastle. Four singles off the over. \u201cA-level physics students had to be told that the circuit needed to be complete?\u201d asks Tom Carver. \u201cPerhaps the deputy had been on his way to have a quiet word with Mr Armstrong\u2019s about his teaching ability.\u201d Oooooh. 25th over: South Africa 98-2 (Amla 52, Markram 17) Amla is 45 from 73 here - that\u2019s a lot of dots. Does he make sure he bats long; does he get going or get out? He takes two into the off side, then raises his fifty by flipping four past mid on ... just. \u201cAt his best, he\u2019s close to incomparable\u201d says mark Nicholas. Is that possible? Can one be semi-comparable? 24th over: South Africa 91-2 (Amla 45, Markram 17) South Africa are \u201cjust letting Santner bowl\u201d as they say. Amla takes one down the ground, then Markram pushes and Williamson dives, stops, rolls and throws ... Santner isn\u2019t quite behind the stumps, so has to drag it onto them and Markram gets home on the dive. He celebrates by clouting a half-volley for four, and South Africa are just tickling the gas. 23rd over: South Africa 84-2 (Amla 43, Markram 12) Simon Doull wants Latham up to the stumps, and then Markram comes down and takes one on the pads. \u201cAny international keeper worth his salt would be at the stumps right now,\u201d fumes yerman as they chap a leg-bye. Glorious. Five off the over. 22nd over: South Africa 79-2 (Amla 41, Markram 10) Four singles added to the total - this isn\u2019t so intense now, and is dallying around the \u201cone for the purists\u201d territory. But we\u2019re still set fair for a thriller. \u201cPeter Salmon\u2019s pub based cricket game sounds like fun,\u201d emailes Brian Withington. \u201cI was wondering about the scarcity of scoring threes and discovered that in York there\u2019s a pub near the Minster called the Three Legged Mare, known affectionately as the Wonkey Donkey. Presumably sighting the Fox and Hounds would cause heated debate about the size of the pack?\u201d Which brings us back to Rory Stewart. Mornington Crescent! 21st over: South Africa 75-2 (Amla 39, Markram 8) De Grandhomme tanks through another one, conceding just two. This is like the 1992 World Cup final. \u201cA-level physics,\u201d says Smylers, \u201cthe teacher (Hi, Mr Armstrong) arrives to find some of my classmates connecting the 5000 volt (but very low current) power supply to the door handle. Naturally he admonishes them, pointing out that for somebody to get a shock they\u2019d need to be completing a circuit by touching two separate objects. So we \u2018casually\u2019 position a trolley near the door, and send a pupil out the fire escape to go round to the main door and see whether somebody entering would naturally push the trolley with one hand while still touching the door handle with t\u2019other. While he\u2019s out, we connect black to the door handle and red to the trolley. Our tester\u2019s about to reach the door when ... the deputy head cuts in front of him. The circuit worked, but the unimpressed deputy head did ask the teacher to step outside for \u2018a quiet word\u2019. Superb - A-level physics lads were lads. 20th over: South Africa 73-2 (Amla 38, Markram 7) Santner rustles through another over unmolested - who are South Africa going to go for? It\u2019ll take a serious bowling performance to win this with 270ish. 19th over: South Africa 71-2 (Amla 37, Markram 5) De Grandhomme, who wrestles crocodiles in his spare time, barrels in and crumps Amla on the pad first up; they think about a review, but it was perhaps going down ... no, hitting the top of leg so umpire\u2019s call. Amla then nabs a single and that\u2019s it for the over; it\u2019s a bit Test-match, this - South Africa need to get a wriggle on if this pitch is as good as we\u2019ve been told. \u201cI\u2019m able to watch live cricket for the first time in a good decade. I\u2019m sure this has been noted before, but Colin de Grandhomme is big chap, isn\u2019t he? Are there any other appropriately named cricketers?\u201d There are some good ironically-named footballers - Melo, Bravo, Noble, and such... 18th over: South Africa 69-2 (Amla 36, Markram 5) Santner comes on for a tweak and they knock him about for three. I reckon South Africa will be looking for 300ish here. 17th over: South Africa 66-2 (Amla 34, Markram 4) They\u2019re struggling to get De Grandhomme away, and after Amla adds one more, he finds the away movement to beat Markram outside off. That\u2019s drinks. 16th over: South Africa 65-2 (Amla 33, Markram 4) Ferguson begins with a bouncer and really, it\u2019s odd how few there\u2019ve been given how quickly how soft the white ball gets. Amla snatches a single thereafter, before Markram gets away with a drive through cover . I\u2019m not certain he got all of that, but the big stride and bat speed forced it to the fence anyroad. \u201cYour story about the prank by the teacher,\u201d says Sean Cunningham, \u201creminded me of a time when I was a little distraught at school and took out my anger by writing a bad word on the bathroom mirror using soap; realising someone was in the stalls I scarpered. A minute later the head boy charged into the common room demanding everyone empty their pockets to see if anyone had the \u2018chalk\u2019 use to write the word; guess what I had in my pocket?\u201d Gray\u2019s Sporting Almanac? 15th over: South Africa 60-2 (Amla 32, Markram 0) This, right here, might just be the match. If these two can\u2019t build something, this innings could well struggle. De Grandhomme into the attack and induces one play and miss from Markram after Amla adds a single. He needs to make something substantial from here. Hit that! Ferguson sends down the first bumper of the innings, then flings down an absolute jazzer of a yorker, hissing, spitting, screeching and screaming past the bat and into off stump. That was a sensational delivery \u2013 you\u2019d be pleased with it. 14th over: South Africa 59-1 (Amla 31, Du Plessis 23) More short ones reckons McCullum, but instead Ferguson bangs in just back of a length and Amla\u2019s middling them now, bumping three to wide, deep third man. And have a look! Another wide one, and Fafz doesn\u2019t need to be asked twice, absolutely clouting four through cover to raise the 50 partnership. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing signs that this pitch is a good one,\u201d laments McCullum. 13th over: South Africa 52-1 (Amla 28, Du Plessis 19) Another for Henry, and this is a decent over for South Africa. A single to Du Plessis gives Amla strike and he drives uppishly for three before Du Plessis glides through mid off. De Grandhomme chases like billy=o, dives well ... and following a prolonged study, has not, in fact, saved four. \u201cSorry me again,\u201d says Peter Salmon, \u201cbut I have to ask the question we all want the answer to: HOW DID BEN POWELL GET A SKELETON KEY FOR ALL THE INTERNAL DOORS OF THE SCHOOL?!!! Surely that is the dream of every schoolboy. Could he also make himself invisible to steal stuff?\u201d I have a key yarn. I was once approached by a teacher, who told me he fancied playing a prank on one of my mates, so could I come up with something. I took his keys and put them in my mate\u2019s pocket. My mate\u2019s then sat in his next lesson and who should arrive but the teacher looking for his keys and the deputy head. \u201cI don\u2019t have them says my mate\u201d; \u201cAlright then, turn out your pockets.\u201d The teacher hasn\u2019t though through this part of it, so ends up having to tell the deputy head, his boss, that actually it was all a joke. The deputy head took it well, as deputy heads are wont do. 12th over: South Africa 44-1 (Amla 25, Du Plessis 14) Ferguson replaces Boult - I daresay Du Plez and Amla in particular will be getting a close look at the maker\u2019s name. Amla takes his loosener for one, you bet he does, and Du Plessis then slices a single to third man. Amla then takes two to point, which gives him a magical, mortifying 8000th ODI run. Only Kohli got their quicker. Amla is an absolute boss. 11th over: South Africa 40-1 (Amla 22, Du Plessis 13) Henry continues and finds some nice shape away - Du Plessis is tempted, but just pulls away at the last millisecond. These lads are so very very good. Another maiden. 10th over: South Africa 40-1 (Amla 22, Du Plessis 13) Du Plessis, who takes a big stride down the track and clumps through mid off. He doesn\u2019t get all of it and the face closes in the process, but it speeds to the fence nonetheless ... and after a dot he gets all of the next one, wide, short and clattered through cover. A sweetness single follows, and I\u2019m pretty sure South Africa would\u2019ve took this at the start of the powerplay. 9th over: South Africa 31-1 (Amla 22, Du Plessis 4) Well look at that. Henry swishes through a maiden, but this has the look of a match that\u2019ll be decided by wickets not runs. \u201cI can\u2019t blend riffs like Abhijato,\u201d says Ben Powell, \u201cthough I can \u2018boast\u2019 of the experience of earning a suspension from school for the crime of possessing and using (and being caught with) a skeleton key to all the internal doors of our school. I was going to describe this as the tip of the iceberg, but it was more the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, I feel, which other straws are probably not fit for publication in a newspaper of the Guardian\u2019s standing. Unfortunately the suspension was in February, and I don\u2019t recall any tour games happening at the time, and, in fact, have little memory of the extra time off, other than the prolonged (28 years and counting) bollocking it earned me from my parents.\u201d At least your dad wasn\u2019t the deputy head of the school which felt such antipathy towards you, eh. 8th over: South Africa 31-1 (Amla 22, Du Plessis 4) In commentary, McCullum says he\u2019s not sure New Zealand should\u2019ve fielded, and Amal shows why! First, he transfers weight beautifully to drive four through cover point and then, when Boult goes around, he strokes through mid off for four more. Now he\u2019s in! Those were vintage! He adds a single for good measure, and already this could be a key partnership. 7th over: South Africa 22-1 (Amla 13, Du Plessis 4) This is great stuff, tough, absorbing and intense - 50-over cricket is absolutely bazzing - if South Africa can refrain from collapse, we could have waselves a serious ball-game. Du Plessis edges two - Ferguson does very well to save the boundary - and both these batsmen are in but not in at all. \u201cDid anyone else used to play car cricket?\u201d asks peter Salmon. \u201cVery simple, runs were scored based on how many legs the character in the name of a passing pub had - Red Lion was four, the swan was two, etc. Royalty, King\u2019s Head and so on, was out. I think we had more byzantine laws that gave ones and sixes. Had the astonishing effect of making a dull car ride just that little it duller.\u201d Gosh, where did you grow up? Ottley or Kings Street? In my ends we had to make do with toilet cricket. 6th over: South Africa 20-1 (Amla 13, Du Plessis 2) Boult is grooved, another fuller one drawing Amla\u2019s desperate glance; it misses and he wears a knuck on the pad, but outside leg - and we see the ball was missing leg stump too. But from here it looks a matter of time. Amla, though, is fighting, and twists two when Boult strays straight. 5th over: South Africa 18-1 (Amla 11, Du Plessis 2) Henry finds some swing off a fuller one to spirit one away from Amla, who drives airily. He\u2019s not in nick at all, and unlike in Tests when you can perform a Strauss career-saver simply by not giving it away, there\u2019s nowhere to hide over 50. But he adds three next ball, the only runs from the over. \u201cGoochie should also be remembered for being the father of the term \u2018daddy hundred\u2019\u201d emails John Starbuck. \u201cPerhaps lasting cricket fame is more about contributions to the language than for actual athletic feats?\u201d Yes, agreed - it\u2019s funny how language permeates. I was late to the pub the other day so naturally informed I was playing catch-up. Who knew that Henry Kelly was shaping our interaction at the same time as celebrating European differences and integration? 4th over: South Africa 15-1 (Amla 8, Du Plessis 2) Another quietish over, just four from it - it\u2019s funny really, for all the master blasting at the top - and surely that\u2019s what Stevie was talking about - now it\u2019s serious we\u2019re back to the wickets in hand. The more things change and all that. 3rd over: South Africa 12-1 (Amla 5, Du Plessis 2) One off the over, a single to Amla driven into the covers. I wonder If Amal Clooney types Amla as often as I\u2019m typing Amal. Look at Abhijato Sensarma, effortlessly blending two riffs. \u201cMany cricketers from the subcontinent,\u201d he says, \u201c(where English isn\u2019t a native language), especially in the good old days, have one common reserve phrase which they use as a reply to all questions asked in a foreign accent they can\u2019t comprehend - \u2018The boys played well\u2019. It\u2019s one of the things everyone knows and laughs about, both in as well as outside the professional cricketing circle. A few years ago, when our biology teacher asked my witty classmate a question none of us knew the answer to, he stroked his imaginary beard for a while, then sagely said - \u2018Ma\u2019am, the boys played well\u2019. He ended up getting a school, um, \u2018vacation\u2019 the next day, but it was a shared classic moment in all of our childhood highlights reel.\u201d My word, if that was the standard for suspension, how was anyone ever there? 2nd over: South Africa 11-1 (Amla 4, Du Plessis 2) Du Plessis drives to extra cover and they take a second - presumably at Amla\u2019s behest, given the look he receives - and Du Plessis has to charge home. That should have blown the cobwebs away. No there will not! Boult is full of length, gets a little bit of nip off the surface as De Kock makes room to drive, and that\u2019s all he needs, stumps splattering like broken fingers. 2nd over: South Africa 9-0 (De Kock 5, Amla 4) Boult is fairly charging in, but his third ball slants across De Kock and he glances it for four more. I doubt there\u2019ll be many more of those. 1st over: South Africa 5-0 (De Kock 1, Amla 4) De Kock has a nervous flail at Henry\u2019s second ball, doing well to avoid edging; he quickly chases down the other end with one into the leg side. Amla is then served a gift, on the pads to flick for four, and he\u2019s away. \u201cA leak in my bathroom has led to me working from home this morning,\u201d exculpates John Butler. \u201cSo now obviously watching the build up and \u2018working\u2019. Interesting to hear Amla is struggling to deal with the short ball after being hit by Archer just prior to the World Cup. Stuart Broad has never been the same batsman after he got a double black eye by the ball that got through his grill. I also got hit in the face when I was 14, which I blame for both ruining my chances of becoming an international sportsman and model. When I got hit, I just naturally reverted to playing off my back foot for what must have been a year. I wondered whether professional cricketers get counseling about this sort of thing because it\u2019s a little like mild PTSD. Or, perhaps, even hypnosis would be useful as a therapy?\u201d I\u2019m sure it\u2019s available to them, but we\u2019re dealing with hardwired stuff - I remember accidentally turning the hot tap on my daughter when she was less than a year old, and she baulked every time I went near it for quite some time afterwards. Henry has the ball... Out come De Kock and Amla, the former in form and the latter so out of it he\u2019s forgotten that good form even exits. South Africa: Amla, De Kock, Markram, Du Plessis, Van der Dussen, Miller, Phehlukwayo, Morris, Rabada, Ngidi, Tahir. New Zealand: Guptill, Munro, Williamson, Taylor, Latham, Neesham, De Grandhomme, Santner, Henry, Ferguson, Boult. Anthem time! \u201cI remember that Gooch catch,\u201d tweets Mr D Johns, \u201cand it was one of the moments that made me fall in love with the whole absurd \u2018circus\u2019 (thanks, Richie Benaud). Weird the clip is labelled as lucky when there are at least 2 moments of athletic brilliance.\u201d Yes, agreed - it should not be forgotten that Gooch was a more than useful footballer and on West Ham\u2019s books. \u201cRe cricketer placeholders,\u201d tweets Jim Baxter. \u201cIt\u2019s an obvious one, but the Australian tendency to start every sentence with \u2018ah, look\u2019 seems to be spreading to cricketers of other nationalities.\u201d I\u2019ve read Carter Beats the Devil - I heartily recommend \u2013 so think this is what they call misdirection. Keep your eyes on the hands at all times. And for anyone old thinking yeah, whatevz, seen that before - well you have. Did you see this dept: \u201cI\u2019m sure Ian Rubenstein\u2019s school pastime can be adapted to the 21st-century workplace PowerPoint cricket,\u201d says Adrian Armstrong. \u201cA single per bullet point, 2 per hyperlink, 4 for an image, 6 for embedded video. A wicket falls, naturally, at the end of each slide. Refinements welcome.\u201d I\u2019m Theodore Donald Kerabatsos here, but think we need to allocate runs for particular phrases: blue sky, imagineer and such. Thoughts... It\u2019s Beuran Hendricks who misses out. Faf du Plessis would also have fielded, but hopes that the blue sky will help the ball come on nicely. He says that the win over Afghanistan was good for self-belief and has made one change: Lungi Ngidi is back, but we\u2019ve not yet been told who he\u2019s replacing. They\u2019re unchanged, and Kane Williamson notes that they\u2019ve gone 11 days without playing. It\u2019s sunny and all, so here we go to Mark Nicholas, resplendent in, er, petrol blue. But here we go! Er, it\u2019s half past the hour and we\u2019re still watching highlights. \u201cJohnson is surely Ian Botham?\u201d tweets Stanlei. \u201cRaab is Tony Greig.\u201d I had Raab as Mark Lathwell \u2013 unfit for purpose and gone as soon as he arrived. \u201c\u2018If Tory leadership candidates were England cricketers of the 80s and 90s?\u201d begins Gary Naylor. \u201cWell, Johnson and co would have to be a lot more right wing for a start \u2013 the PCA was once described as the only trade union further to the right than its employers.\u201d \u201cMy first thought on reading Ian Rubenstein\u2019s words was, \u2018You don\u2019t have to be old to have gone to school and used blackboards.\u2019\u201d emails Matt Dony. \u201cMy second thought was a sad, sad realisation. I\u2019m off to listen to I Don\u2019t Want To Grow Up by Tom Waits, and cry a little bit. I really need the cricket to start soon and distract me from the inexorable march of time.\u201d Yes, cricket definitely has no relationship whatsoever to the slow expiration of life. Wrap yer peepers around this. \u201cThanks for the Ian Bell \u2018Like I said\u2019 video,\u201d says Peter Salmon. \u201cGot some mates,\u201d he boasts - are you sure you\u2019re on the right webpage \u2013 \u201cwho share my obsession with this sort of thing - how is this phrase functioning for him? Obviously it\u2019s a placeholder, but everything he prefaces with \u2018Like I said\u2019 is something he hasn\u2019t said. So he\u2019s drawing on general cultural norms - he reinforces his platitudes by appealing to another to verify them, in this case himself. And, perhaps reminding himself of the party line. Our main obsession is the use of \u2018probably\u2019 by sportspeople, \u2018Yes, we probably played well today and we probably had the best of the umpires but the West Indies are a good side and probably they will be back and I probably like batting here etc.\u2019 No definitive statement without a probably. We tried having a drinking game based around it, but spent too much time hammered.\u201d The great Gary Anderson is also a firm fan of this one, often using it to begin a sentence. In fairness, these lads have to do a lot of talking, generally to people they\u2019d rather miss, about things they speak about a lot. So they might mean \u201clike I said\u201d every bloody time I\u2019m asked this question you deem pertinent, poignant and unique. Get expletive in. I just found myself thinking that, if the Tory leadership candidates were England cricketers of the 80s and 90s, who would be who (whom?)? Of course, it\u2019s quite hard to do this on a family website, but I\u2019ve got Rory Stewart as Peter Such: started well, but brief investigation revealed him to be the indistinct from the rest of them. The umpires are back... \u201cI can\u2019t claim any actual school cricket heroics,\u201d says Ian Rubenstein, but we did invent a pastime called \u201cGesture cricket\u201d which was played in the classes of some of our more fidgety educators. Touching the nose a single, glasses two. Telling a student to stand up was a boundary, out of the classroom a six. Dismissals were signalled by a thump of blackboard (I\u2019m old) or desk. One teacher had a fit of anger, thumped his desk repeatedly and engineered a batting collapse that saw my team dismissed for 10 runs total. Cue the four of us playing at the back of the class rolling around on the floor in hysterics.\u201d I love this! Can someone please engineer me a route back to school just to play this - toilet cricket was as far as we got. Who doesn\u2019t want more Eoin Morgan - what a human being he is. I still find it hard to grasp how few Tests he\u2019s played, and would be seeking a way to get him back in. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of the country for 20 years,\u201d brags Tim Maitland. \u201cDoes your mention of Vimto mean you\u2019re proper northern or has it become the ironic drink of choice by ukele-playing, man-bun wearing, moustache-waxing southern hipsters?\u201d I\u2019ve worn many insults, but hipster is not one of them \u2013 I am pure unreconstructed in the proudest tradition of the OBO. I grew up drinking Vimto because my dad is Manc \u2013 we\u2019d come back from my gran\u2019s with carloads of that and kuchen, a kind of tea-loaf but nice, kuchen meaning cake in Yiddish. Depending on the variety selected, it came with icing, raisins, glacier cherries, cinnamon, jam and cheese and was absolutely spectacular, though think it has pretty much ceased to exist. Ok, seeing as we\u2019re here for a bit, one of my other school, er, holidays: reciprocating a Nescafe handshake offered from a bus window, only to accidentally trigger a rather large confab the following afternoon. \u201cThis match is at least the prince if not the king of the roundrobin stage,\u201d reckons Amod Paranjape. \u201cAnd if South Africa are knocked out today, then are we again allowed to use the C word mate?\u201d C for cricketingly challenged? Definitely. Shaun Pollock reckons 75 minutes and we\u2019ll be out there for a full 50-over game. From your mouth to his ears, old mate. The umpires have reinspected, \u201cit\u2019s improving\u201d says Umpire Gould, and we\u2019ve got another inspection at 11. The outfield is wet, all of it, and they need the sun to come out to dry stuff out ... AND THERE IT IS! There\u2019s a good chance of play soon, they reckon, and the thunderstorms predicted for last night failed to materialise. \u201cIn this BCCI world cup feat. ICC,\u201d emails Krishnamoorthy V, \u201cshould the schedule be so blatant to give a red carpet treatment to India? The India-Pakistan match on Sunday (holiday in India but not in Pakistan), gaps between matches so long that a world tour is possible between them.\u201d The thing that was extremely wrong was how long India waited to get going so their players could recover from the IPL. I think I know what Barry Galahad would say about it, but he\u2019d be wrong. \u201cKia Ora\u201d begins Hari Shankar. Thanks - Vimto for me. Sorry, that is an awful joke, but here we are. Anyway: \u201cHello in kiwi tongue, from the southern hemisphere, where it\u2019s dark, wet and cold. Just like your English summer. Will we have a game on? Would be fun to start the game with a haka to startle the Saffas.\u201d Yes, I\u2019d say we will have a game. There\u2019s a possibility of thunderstorms, imminently and this afternoon, but we should have enough to get something through. The umpires are checking the rain radar - there might be another shower imminent - but the pitch is uncovered, which is a good sign. Email! \u201cThat photo looks positively doomsday-esque,\u201d says Ben Bernards, \u201ccould we be looking at a rain-inspired 20/20 slap-a-thon at last? As a Kiwi, I feel the team is seriously undercooked right now. The favourites for the cup all possess openers that more often or not go big before they go home \u2013 Finch, Warner, Roy, Bairstow, Sharma &amp; Dhawan. By way of comparison, their black-clad equivalents: Munro (one 50 in 19 innings, unlikely to ever stay longer than 10 overs) and Guptill (clearly not in form) look a poor man\u2019s version. So much rests on Taylor and Williamson who have performed solidly rather than spectacularly, and the lower order has failed its only audition with the bat thus far vs Bangladesh.\u201d Yes \u2013 if New Zealand get it done, it\u2019ll be because they win the toss, field, and their bowlers have a good day in helpful conditions. Apparently my email hyperlink wasn\u2019t working earlier; please send all missives to daniel.harris.casual@guardian.co.uk. Cricinfo tells us that the umpires are making their way to the middle... I loved Robin Smith growing up, I guess because I identified with him more than his contemporaries, who were either a bit this or a bit that. And also because when he posted that wondrous 167 not out against Australia, I was home from school with a box of Superkings, suspended for setting the floor of the science labs on fire. And obviously England still lost. Anyway, regale us with tales of your school derring-do while we wait for some progress in the middle. Look at this! Here\u2019s Robin Smith being interviewed by Don McRae. And here\u2019s Robin Smith\u2019s autobiography, ghosted by OBO guru Rob Smyth. It\u2019s as brilliant as you imagine because sometimes, the cosmos just works. There\u2019s going to be an inspection at 10.15, after which we\u2019re expecting nao drahmahs. This might be a good toss to win - I\u2019m sure New Zealand will be desperate to get South Africa in. There\u2019s been a lot of overnight rain and we\u2019ve got a delayed toss. It\u2019s dry now, though, and Baz McCullum - yeah, we\u2019re on nickname terms \u2013 Isa Guha and Shaun Pollock have come in matching petrol blue suits, so. Which of course reminds us all of this. Absolutely nothing to do with cricket, but to warm ourselves up, let\u2019s enjoy the phenomenal standard of itiswhatitising from Barry Galahad. Psst \u2026 psst \u2026 are we ... are we ... back? After a riveting start which suggested this strange format was to all our benefits because it gave us lots of matches involving lots of fine teams, the rain intervened and things started going exactly to form. The top four seemed settled \u2013 perhaps it still is \u2013 and the individual feats of derring-do dried up too. Not no mo. On Monday, Bangladesh battered West Indies \u2013 not a seismic shock, but the emphatic nature of it was as memorable as it was majestic \u2013 then yesterday, Eoin Morgan reinvented our conception of the possible. Now, here we are today. South Africa are in the brown stuff. They\u2019ve been rubbish so far and looking at their batting order it\u2019s not especially hard to see why, missing pacemen or not. But they\u2019ve still got enough to trouble anyone, and surely they can\u2019t play this many matches without happening upon a performance at some point \u2013 they\u2019re not quite out yet, but they need to win today. New Zealand, meanwhile, are doin the do like Betty Boo, seeing away everyone you\u2019d expect them to as they prepare for final or semi-final defeat \u2026 except that this time they combine fair and solidity so effectively that maybe, just maybe, things\u2019ll be different. Given their last two tussles are against England and Australia, they need to cement that possibility - if one can actually cement a possibility \u2013 with victory today. If they cannot, they too have a problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
