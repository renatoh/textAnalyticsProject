A 7-1 victory for Manchester United in the European Cup over one of the leading lights in Italy's Serie A. Not just defeat for Roma, either, but humiliation, underlined by ITV running a mock Goal of the Month competition based solely on United's strikes on Tuesday night. Were we not all united in our admiration for one of the finest performances in the history of the competition? Well, up to a point. But with a 4-0 half-time lead, and the Roma players mentally on the plane back home, was there any need for the three second-half goals? In American sports, they call it \"running up the score\". In Chorlton-cum-Hardy they call it taking the piss. Wikipedia defines \"running up the score\" as \"scoring more points than are necessary to win the game\", and suggests reasons why teams might be so unsportsmanlike, one of which is \"to demonstrate domination of one's opponents, and intimidate them and future opponents\". As a fan of West Ham, who face United in the final Premiership match of the season, I have to say I was already intimidated by half-time. The further peacock-like spreading of the feathers, urged on by a crowd booing every Roman touch, was surely not necessary. If not rude, the extravagance of the scoreline was certainly in bad taste. I mean, was it not enough for United to insult the eternal city by warning fans travelling to the away leg of the dangers lurking there - unlike Manchester, whose streets you would happily walk alone at night. Did they have to add to the insult a week later? The least United could have done in the cause of Anglo-Italian relations was substitute Rooney, Ronaldo, and Smith for the second half. Ah, but what have the Romans ever done for us, you might respond? To which I would refer you to that unimpeachable historical source, Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
