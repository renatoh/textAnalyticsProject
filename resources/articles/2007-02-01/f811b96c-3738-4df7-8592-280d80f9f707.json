The decision to close the factory has left the iconic brand facing worldwide protests and demonstrations organised by the GMB union with the campaign backed by actors Rachel Weisz and Emma Thompson, pop singer Sir Tom Jones, opera singer, Bryn Terfel, Manchester United football boss, Sir Alec Ferguson and comedian and writer, Ben Elton. Mr Pearce yesterday drew a distinction between the Treochy factory making mainly polo shirts and the factories in Castleford and Rotherham in Yorkshire making what he called \"iconic trench coats\" which he said would continue to be manufactured in the UK. Some 2,000 staff are employed in Britain, including in the company's London headquarters. In a memo to MPs, Mr Pearce said: \"Treorchy was not commercially viable...and it is now possible to source certain products of greater quality overseas at a significantly lower cost.\" The company plans to move production to suppliers in China and Europe. He denied union claims that suppliers pay the lowest wages. Responding to committee chairman Dr Hwyel Francis, Labour MP for Aberavon, Mr Pearce insisted the company checked that child labour was not employed and said Burberry would not source products from Bangladesh or the Philippines because of concerns over \"minimum wage levels.\" Two Tories on the committee, Stephen Crabb, MP for Preseli and David Jones, MP for Clwyd East, backed the company with Mr Crabb querying whether it should move the rest of its manufacturing abroad to beat global competition. Mervyn Burnett, GMB senior organiser, came under fire from the Tories for suggesting the closure was part of \"corporate greed\". The MPs queried how this could be said when the firm was offering to give the factory and \u00a31m to the community. Mr Burnett said this was \" just a publicity stunt.\" The union believed the company could make \u00a322m from making polo shirts at Treochy that sell for \u00a355 and cost \u00a311 to produce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
