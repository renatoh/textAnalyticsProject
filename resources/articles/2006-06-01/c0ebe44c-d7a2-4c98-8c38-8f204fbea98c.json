The retirement last July of the Tour's most dominant and controversial star, a man who deals only in certainties, leaves the world's greatest cycle race in a state of shivering uncertainty. Like Hamlet's father, Armstrong will overshadow events by his very absence. No cyclist has ever dominated the Tour for so long, or in such crushing style. For five years, the Armstrong Tours had, more or less, a shape of their own; he would turn up and ride well in the prologue time trial, his team would win the team time trial; he would take the yellow jersey at the first summit finish. The Texan cancer survivor's team controlled the race; every significant escape was monitored by their team manager Johan Bruyneel and permitted to go ahead only if it suited Armstrong's tactical interests. 'The way he squashed the race was quite convenient for a lot of riders because the race was more controlled,' says the British professional Charly Wegelius. 'This year a lot of people will be looking at each other waiting for someone else to take the lead.' On paper at least, this year's Tour comes down to a straight fight between two men: the Italian Ivan Basso and the German Jan Ullrich. But it will be more than that. It will be a matter of who is willing and able to take the initiative after years of basing their strategy on watching Armstrong and surviving. The pair have adopted contrasting approaches. Basso has, if anything, made life more difficult for himself by racing his home Tour, the Giro d'Italia, to win, and doing so alla grande, winning three mountain stages. The double of Giro and Tour is a rare feat, the property of cycling's greats such as Indurain, Hinault and Merckx. Armstrong never attempted it because he did not wish to compromise his preparation for the French event. Basso accepts he may have trouble keeping in peak form for three months, if the four weeks between the two events is included. 'Of course to ride the Giro full gas and to win is hard... this year is a little surprising because I use a lot of energy for the Giro for the win.' His manager, Bjarne Riis, a Tour winner in 1996, acknowledges 'everybody knows that it is not easy to peak in the Giro and peak again two months later.' Ullrich, on the other hand, has built steadily to a peak after a poor early season. He has done so every year since winning the Tour in 1997 and it was never sufficient to overcome Armstrong. Like Basso, he scored an important win in the Giro, taking a time trial stage, but then he quit before the finish, returning to win the Tour of Switzerland last week. Basso accepts that Ullrich's brute strength will give him an advantage in the two long time trials in this year's Tour. 'Jan will take time from me in the time trials and I don't know how much. I could lose two to four minutes. There are too many time trials and not enough mountain-top finishes and it's possible I don't have enough climbs.' There is also a small group of outsiders, men who cannot be discounted, but do not have the pure pedigree of the Italian and the German. Alexandr Vinokourov has the killer instinct and all-round strength, but has yet to show the day-in, day-out consistency it takes to win the Tour. Alejandro Valderde of Spain won a mountain stage last year, and is currently leading the ProTour standings after a strong early season, but has yet to finish a Tour; Paco Mancebo, his fellow Spaniard, is a fine rider, but essentially a follower. Armstrong will remain influential in another way. One of the spin-offs of his years at the top was the presence of a group of strong American stage racers, past and present team-mates: the Memnonite and former mountain bike racer Floyd Landis, winner of three stage races this year including the Paris-Nice; Levi Leipheimer, who recently won the toughest Tour warm-up, the Dauphine Libere and Armstrong's oldest friend in cycling, George Hincapie. Armstrong's legacy notwithstanding, there remains another huge area of doubt in this year's Tour. The race takes place against the background of what is potentially a massive drugs scandal in Spain, where a six-month police investigation codenamed Operation Puerto led to the discovery of banned drugs and several hundred sachets of blood that had been removed from athletes apparently for transfusion to enhance performance at a later date. Operation Puerto has already had ramifications for the Tour. It has led to one team, the Spanish squad Comunidad Valenciana, being refused a place at the Tour, while two riders at Landis's Phonak squad linked to the investigation in media reports - Santiago Botero of Colombia and Jose-Enrique Gutierrez, who finished second in the Giro d'Italia - have been provisionally suspended by the team pending further inquiries. There have also been calls for the Tour organisers to reject another Spanish team, Astana, who are led by Vinokourov. He has not been connected to the inquiry, but the former team manager, Manolo Saiz, was detained by police, although he was not placed under formal investigation. After this, the team's main backer, the American insurance company Liberty, pulled out, and Saiz resigned. The team have a licence to race under a new sponsor, a consortium of Kazakh firms, but cycling's governing body, the International Cycling Union, and the Tour organisers are still waiting for further information to emerge from the Spanish police and have said they will deal firmly with any riders linked to the inquiry. The question of who is on the list of names drawn up by the investigation team will haunt the race until it reaches Paris. Three vying for Armstrong's crown Ivan Basso (Italy) CSC The man in form. Scored a crushing win four weeks ago in the Giro d'Italia, with the biggest winning margin since 1965. His CSC team is the strongest in the race on paper, but the only question is whether their 28-year-old can hold his form to improve on his second place in the Tour behind Armstrong last year. Jan Ullrich (Germany) T-Mobile The only previous winner still racing. Has managed four second places since his win back in 1997. Now 32, he is likely to be Basso's biggest threat. Struggled to gain form early in the year due to a knee injury, but recently came good with a stage win in the Giro d'Italia and the overall title on the Tour of Switzerland. Alexandr Vinokourov (Kazakhstan) Astana Third in 2003 behind Armstrong and Ullrich. Matchless racer, perhaps the only cyclist in the pack with the Texan's killer instinct, and won two stages last year. The big question is whether further revelations from a drug investigation in Spain may affect his team or even cause it to withdraw from the race.
