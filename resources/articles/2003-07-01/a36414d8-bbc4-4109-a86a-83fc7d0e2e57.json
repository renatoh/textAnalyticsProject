Mike de Kock, the South African trainer of Victory Moon, reported his horse in prime form yesterday ahead of his attempt to make history in the King George at Ascot on Saturday. It was at the same course that Choisir burst to fame with two victories at the Royal meeting. Incredible though that achievement was, however, it would fade into a distant second place if Victory Moon could take the British season's all-aged showpiece this weekend. Sprinters, in all honesty, are just, well, sprinters, but King George winners immediately take their place alongside the great post-War champions of the turf. \"Victory Moon is very, very well,\" said de Kock. \"We were always looking at his first two runs [in the Queen Anne at Royal Ascot and Eclipse Stakes at Sandown] as being preparations for the King George. \"We gave him a break after he won [the UAE Derby] in Dubai, and it would have been impossible to get him ready for those, so we used them to bring him on. That's the way we do it in South Africa, we like horses to make steady improvement.\" The size and strength of the field that Victory Moon will face on Saturday remains a little hazy, not least because of worries over possible fast going. \"It looks like there could be a few scratching if the ground is too fast,\" de Kock says, \"but our horse will run on any ground. He was going on well at the end of the Eclipse, and he will love the mile and a half at Ascot. \"Choisir's wins gave us a lot of confidence, he was a real boost and win, lose or draw on Saturday, hopefully we'll be back if we've got another that's good enough.\" Victory Moon was popular with Ladbrokes' punters yesterday, and is 12-1 (from 16-1) in their ante-post list, while Sulamani, who drifted in the market for most of last week, is back in to 6-1 (from 8-1) with the same firm. He is not a definite runner on Saturday, though, with Godolphin having postponed a decision on their King George team until later in the week. Kris Kin, though, seems sure to run. The Derby winner ducked out of the Irish Derby at The Curragh last month as a result of the fast ground but Joe Mercer, racing manager to the Saeed Suhail, the colt's owner, said yesterday that everything is on line for the King George.\" \"A drop of rain would help but I'm certain they'll put some water on it,\" Mercer said. \"It'll be decent ground and it won't be a problem.\" Nick Cheyne, the clerk of the course at Ascot, confirmed yesterday that the taps will go on today. \"The ground is good to firm, good in places,\" he said, \"We are going to put some water on tomorrow. The forecast is for some showers around so obviously we'll monitor that at the same time. The forecast is unsettled with maybe a bit more rain on Thursday.\" Warrsan, the Coronation Cup winner, was also reported to be progressing well yesterday, following a disappointing run in an Italian Group One last month. \"He got stung rather badly by mosquitos [in Italy] and it upset him quite a bit and he froze in the stalls,\" Clive Brittain, his trainer, said. \"It was not just up to his usual standard. \"The work I've done with him has been impressive. I think he's going there with a very big chance so we are looking forward to it. \"He has done his normal routine work. He enjoys his swimming so it's half the battle if you don't have to use so much leg work on the gallops.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
