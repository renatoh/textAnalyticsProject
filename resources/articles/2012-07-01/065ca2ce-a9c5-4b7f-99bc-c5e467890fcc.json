Hours after Labour had called for him to make a rare appearance before peers, Green was seen on Thursday afternoon in the office of Lord Strathclyde, the Leader of the Lords. Green was at the helm of HSBC during the period when a Senate committee in the US found it had bust sanctions and moved money for drug barons. One Labour party official said he saw Green sitting outside Strathclyde's office \"perched on a wooden bench like a naughty school boy\" although it is thought that Green does not have immediate plans to appear in the Lords or make a public statement in response to the exposure of HSBC's money laundering. Green has refused to comment since the revelations about HSBC laundering money for drug cartels, terrorists and pariah states emerged this week during Senate hearings in the US. Green was chief executive of HSBC between 2003 and 2006 and was its chairman until 2010, when he resigned to take up a position of trade minister in the coalition government. His tenure covered the period of the damning Senate report which concluded the bank had a \"pervasively polluted\" culture which allowed HSBC subsidiaries to move billions of dollars around the financial system from countries such as Iran and Syria. Cash was also moved for Mexican drug cartels. There was no personal criticism of him in the Senate report. The revelations have allowed Labour to put pressure on Green over his record in the Lords where, since he arrived in November 2010, he has spoken just five times. Labour also argued that he has questions to answer because he was chairman of the British Bankers' Association during the Libor-fixing scandal and is also an adviser to the Treasury on banking matters. But Strathclyde appeared to be standing behind Green and rejected Labour's insistence that the former banker should appear in the Lords while his attendance record was defended on the basis that he travels widely as a trade minister. Labour's leader in the Lords, Lady Royall, had written to Strathclyde to argue that \"in line with the provisions of the ministerial code, and in relation to the impact of the disclosures concerning HSBC on his role as minister of trade, Lord Green should come to parliament to make a statement to the House of Lords before the house rises next week. We would urge you, as the principal government minister in the House of Lords, to make arrangements for such a statement to be given.\" The Labour peer Lord Hollick tweeted that Green \"must come to the house to explain why he did not heed warnings of money laundering at his bank\". The Labour leader Ed Miliband called on David Cameron to intervene. \"Lord Green certainly has some big questions to answer,\" the Labour leader said. \"Now if this was a House of Commons minister and the House of Commons was sitting there is no question in my mind that the minister would feel it was right to come to the House of Commons. \"I hope that the prime minister will encourage him to do that because that would be the right thing for him to do as a minister in the government.\" The House of Lords goes into recess on 28 July, but the chamber sits for the last time on 25 July. But in a letter to Royall, Strathclyde said that Green was only required, under the ministerial code, to go the Lords to discuss \"his ministerial portfolio\". \"It would therefore not be appropriate for him to make a ministerial statement to the house in relation to matters pertaining to his career prior to becoming a minister,\" the leader of the Lords said. When the Libor scandal erupted, the Conservatives were quick to try to score political points by attempting \u2013 wrongly \u2013 to link shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a former minister in the Labour government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
