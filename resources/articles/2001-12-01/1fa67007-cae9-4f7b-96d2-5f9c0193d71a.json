To risk a brief walk outside the hotel is to invite immediate company - and that is only from the England security men. Beyond them the unchanging vista is of hundreds of well-wishers, each armed with a pen and a grubby autograph book. In the land of contemplation, it is often impossible for an England cricketer to hear himself think. \"I love the outdoor life,\" says Hoggard. \"Ten minutes outside my front door and I'm up on Baildon Moor with no one about. I can't do that here, and it's all a bit claustrophobic. In Mumbai, three of us went to a restaurant and we took about 1,500 security men so we needed two taxis and a Land Rover to fit us all in.\" With his international career only three Tests old, the 24-year-old expected to enter today's Ahmedabad Test as England's only specialist fast bowler. It is an onerous responsibility, thrust upon him not so much by achievement as circumstance, but he shows no outward signs of concern. In fact Hoggard, a large and gentle man with a maverick's chuckle, rarely seems disturbed by anything. \"I've played three Tests, two of them in England, and suddenly people are saying that I'm the senior bowler, carrying great responsibility. It seems a bit odd to me. I'm just another bowler trying to learn quickly and do the business.\" He plays down his success during tour matches in Pakistan last winter. \"It was like bowling for Yorkshire at a wet Headingley, so it was bound to be good fun. There are about seven seamers running in there, all expecting to get among the wickets almost every over they bowl, so this is a different mentality.\" Angus Fraser is one former England bowler he has searched out to discuss the disciplines needed on Indian pitches. \"I naturally bowl with a consistent line, but my length can be a bit variable,\" he says. \"You've got to concentrate every ball out here - it's got more of a feel of one-day cricket when every stray ball matters so much.\" Hoggard recognises that it is over the next fortnight, first here and then in Bangalore, that any substantial wicket-taking haul would begin to push his name alongside those of the tour absentees, Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick. \"If their absence helps me eventually keep them out of the side then so much the better. If other people take wickets then no places are guaranteed. Gough and Caddick being infallible at the top, I just don't believe it. It's not about bearing grudges because people are not here; they had to make their own personal decisions. \"Goughie's decision to stay at Yorkshire has got to be good for us. It would have been a huge loss for us if he had left.\" Hoggard had been chatting to VVS Laxman, the Indian batsman, a long-time teammate with Pudsey Congs in Yorkshire league cricket. Laxman had promised him that \"red soil means more bounce\" and Hoggard knew that the pitch at the Sardar Patel stadium in Ahmedabad was, indeed, very red. But then Hyderabad had been terracotta and the bounce there had been subterranean. He was wondering whether he had been the victim of a wind-up. He is a soft lad is Hoggard, with a countryman's love of animals. Gujarat is suffering a prolonged drought - the monsoon failed again this year - and the scenes in the streets have touched him greatly. \"I see dogs in the streets and I want to pet them, but you can't really. I see the cows in terrible condition. And I see the poverty of the people and the children running around naked. And I tell myself that my job is meant to be about bowling out Sachin, Lax and Ganguly.\" If his tour reading has been Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs - \"as a fast bowler, you have to give people the illusion that you are a bit of a psychopath\" - he is unlikely to maintain the persona for long. In the middle of a long, dispiriting spell, on dead Indian pitches, he sings songs by the Dubliners and the Spinners, songs picked up around childhood campfires; his parents were members of a folk band and still go camping most summer weekends in the Dales and the Wolds. There may be about 40,000 spectators screaming at him over the next few days but it is in walking back to his run that Hoggard, if anywhere in India, can become preoccupied with his thoughts. And in the field he says he is also dreaming of a bacon sandwich. But the dream that really matters to him is that of an Indian side bowled out cheaply. \u00b7 The England and Wales Cricket Board's chief executive Tim Lamb was yesterday given full authority by the management board to conduct urgent negotiations with India over their threat to pull out of the fourth Test on next summer's tour of England. The Indian board president Jagmohan Dalmiya wants England to play a sixth one-day international on their current tour and commit to a five-Test series in 2005-6. Dalmiya has said India will not play the scheduled fourth Test at the Oval unless England agree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
