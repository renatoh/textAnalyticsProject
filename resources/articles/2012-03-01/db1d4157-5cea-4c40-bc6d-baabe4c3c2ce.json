The second-row, a regular in Wales's World Cup campaign, made his comeback for Newport Gwent Dragons last weekend after more than three months out of action with a wrist injury and was immediately recalled by Wales. \"Luke is not here to make up the numbers,\" said the Wales attack coach, Rob Howley. \"He is here to be selected and it is good to have him back. It is nice for us to have another selection issue and he was a big part of our World Cup success.\" Wales started the Six Nations without a number of players, including the tight-five forwards Gethin Jenkins, Matthew Rees, Alun Wyn Jones and Charteris, but their only injury worry before Saturday's match against Italy in Cardiff is the centre Jamie Roberts, who suffered a recurrence of knee ligament damage against England in the last round of matches. \"We are not sure about Jamie,\" said Howley. \"He has to come through training in the next two days and he is our only doubt at the moment. We will pick our strongest available side against Italy, without a shadow of doubt. We know it is going to be a hard game and we have to make sure we have our house in order.\" Wales are the only team who can win the grand slam after France's draw with Ireland in Paris on Sunday and they finish their campaign, as they did the last time they achieved the clean sweep in 2008, against France at the Millennium Stadium. \"France were pretty impressive against Ireland and they were unlucky not to win,\" said Howley. \"We have to focus on Italy and in my four years on the Wales management we have never had an easy game against them. There is always a stage when they put you under the pump. \"We seem to have got stronger as the Six Nations has progressed and we have come through a tricky three matches. We are in good shape but we appreciate the magnitude of the task that faces us on Saturday. \"We can control what happens at the Millennium Stadium. It is in our hands. The following day we can take stock of what happens between France and England.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
