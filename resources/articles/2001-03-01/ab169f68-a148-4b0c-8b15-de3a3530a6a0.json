Doctors' leaders will say they are not taking sides but their intervention is likely to help William Hague's attempt to undermine the credibility of NHS reforms - regarded by Labour strategists as one of their strongest electoral suits. The plan emerged yesterday after the BMA council on Wednesday decided patients were being \"short-changed\" by excessive workload. \"Patients in both primary and hospital care get too little time with their doctors. The inexorable rise in workload and the constant flow of new government initiatives and targets have created a very real tide of anger and demoralisation amongst senior hospital doctors and GPs,\" the BMA said. John Chisholm, chairman of its GP committee, said: \"We will not name individual patients or doctors to protect their anonymity, but we will provide evidence of what it is really like in the NHS.\" Dr Chisholm said he was writing to the UK's 36,000 GPs urging them to lobby MPs and parliamentary candidates and contact newspapers, television and radio on workloads and recruitment issues. The average GP was giving 10,000 consultations a year - 50% more than when the NHS was founded in 1948. That cut the average length of a consultation to eight minutes or less. \"This is unfair to patients. It does not give the space they need for reassurance and discussion of the treatments they need, or advice on how to live with chronic illness. For doctors all the pleasure of medicine is destroyed by the conveyor belt pace... The result is work related stress and disaffection,\" he said. The government was planning to appoint an extra 2,000 GPs in England by 2004, but this was less than a fifth of the 10,330 needed to provide a satisfactory service. \"We are way behind even the government's ridiculously low targets for GP recruitment. The government must take some urgent and immediate steps to boost morale, providing pensions incentives to keep older doctors in the workforce and offering hope to new doctors that general practice will be an attractive career where they can serve the community without destroying their own health or disappearing under a mountain of paperwork,\" he said. Derek Machin, deputy chairman of the consultants' committee, said pressure from the government to reduce hospital waiting lists was forcing doctors to prioritise the wrong patients. Ministers were promising to appoint 7,500 more con sultants by 2004, but this was raising patients' expectations without yet reducing the burden on doctors. \"For hospital consultants, the crunch issue really is workload. For too long, consultants have tried to reconcile two contradictory imperatives. We try to fast track patients through the system, squeezing extra appointments into out-patient clinics, discharging patients at lightning speed and putting quantity ahead of quality. That increases the risk of accident and error,\" he said. Plans to intervene in the election came as the BMA moved closer to settling a long-running argument with the general medical council on streamlining disciplinary procedures. Dr Bogle said both sides would support a small GMC executive that could speed up decisions and a larger council of about 50 medical and lay representatives that could discuss policy. There was disagreement about which body should have the more statutory powers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
