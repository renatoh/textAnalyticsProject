Shared ownership allows people to buy a share in a house or flat from a housing association, known as a registered social landlord, or RSL. The buyer has to get a mortgage but the rest of the share is funded through paying a subsidised rent to the RSL. This deal means individuals pay smaller deposits than they would for '100 per cent' open market purchases, and combined mortgage and rent payments are more affordable. The scheme has been hugely successful. The Office of National Statistics says 0.7 per cent of English households and 0.5 per cent of those in Wales are shared ownership. In Milton Keynes, where there has been extensive building of new homes in recent years, more than 5 per cent are owned this way. Most people buy 25 per cent or 50 per cent initially and over time buy further shares, often up to a 75 per cent maximum. Most associations give priority to those who cannot afford to buy a home in any other way - usually public sector tenants or those on local authority or housing association waiting lists. When the property is later sold, the individual and the RSL share the profit or loss proportionately. But now a respected London estate agency says anyone considering this sort of deal should think twice because they may have to pay 100 per cent of the service charge even though they may own as little as 25 per cent of the flat. Stephen Ludlow of agency Ludlow Thompson says most service charges are spent on repairs and maintenance to stop a property from depreciating, thereby protecting its value. But even though RSLs benefit from this, they pay none of the charge. 'Service charges can easily exceed \u00a31,000 a year so for RSLs that is a very profitable sleight of hand. It would be a lot fairer and [more] transparent if the service charge were split between the owners based on their shareholding,' he suggests. He also claims that if an individual wants to sell a stake in a shared scheme at a later date they may find it far more difficult than selling a conventional home on the open market. This is because some RSLs demand first refusal on buying the remainder, while others go to the opposite extreme and insist an individual owner buys out all of the RSL's share and then sell the property on the open market in the 'normal' way. In many cases, clauses in the lease may enable the RSL to nominate a prospective buyer and restrict the price to that given by its nominated valuer. 'There are a lot of hidden costs so for many young people who want the option of being geographically mobile, renting may be the better option,' claims Ludlow. But RSLs have reacted angrily to the attack, with some saying this is the start of tactics by private estate agents to drum up business in a faltering market. Kevin Jones, assistant director of Tower Homes housing association, which operates throughout much of London and the Home Counties, says all such bodies are charitable and there is no profit to be made. 'There are only two sources for charges - the government or individuals who enter into shared ownership. Realistically, government is not going to provide funding for this purpose so we have to get it from individuals. If there is a profit at the end of the year, they are reimbursed,' says Jones. He says rents are already heavily subsidised and there is no alternative to levying the full service charge on individuals. 'It's standard practice on every conventional leasehold property where the resident always pays the full service charge,' he insists. The Housing Corporation, a quango that manages and allocates finances to housing associations, says onward sales of shared ownership properties are no more difficult than any other type of house or flat. Most associations tell sellers upfront that they will nominate a potential buyer who has already expressed an interest in shared ownership. This, among other things, saves paying estate agency fees. 'If anything the typical sale is faster and cheaper than going through an estate agent,' says corporation spokesman Robert Davies. 'If an RSL asks a seller to buy out the association it is because the property was allocated to key workers but that person changed jobs and was no longer a key worker. Even then associations always allow two years for the person to sell,' says Davies. Many private house builders support shared ownership as it allows them to build small units in large developments, ideal for most shared buyers as many are single. Many estate agents also back it as it encourages first-time buyers. However, as property sales have slowed and price falls have appeared across the country, agents are hitting out at anything that reduces turnover and commission. With the market set for a long, cold winter this attack may be just the start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
