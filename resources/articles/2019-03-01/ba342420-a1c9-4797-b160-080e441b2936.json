In one of her strongest criticisms yet, McKenzie accused her former leadership partner of derailing the political conversation. Asked if she was frustrated by Joyce\u2019s comments in recent days, McKenzie said: \u201cI think Australia is frustrated, you know, that there is a politician out there that is not focused on their needs and issues. \u201cIt is really clear when you\u2019re out on the ground, talking to communities, as I have been, and small businesses, out in regional communities and our industries, that power prices is one of the No 1 issues. The cost of living is really biting out there, and so we need to be making sure that our policies address that. \u201cAnd not talking about ourselves.\u201d Joyce, who on Monday declared himself the \u201celected deputy prime minister of Australia\u201d, has escalated tensions within the Coalition and in the Nationals party room by stoking divides over the \u201ccoal war\u201d, which has once again erupted among government MPs. The dispute began last week when six Queensland Nationals-aligned MPs demanded the party leader, Michael McCormack, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, take \u201cimmediate action\u201d and commit to underwriting the construction of a new coal-fired power plant in regional Queensland. \u201cThese people want a coal-fired power station, they should be allowed to get a coal-fired power station,\u201d Joyce told Sky News on Monday night. \u201cA policy of the National party is for a coal-fired power station, and policy for control of power prices relies on an increase of supply, which we\u2019ll get from coal-fired power and a divestment power. \u201cNow we\u2019re standing behind National party policy for National party seats, so as to give us the best chance in the electorate.\u201d The latest clashes have also laid bare chasms over McCormack\u2019s leadership within the partyroom, although not all those pushing for coal back Joyce\u2019s return to the leadership. McKenzie, speaking from Victoria, where the Coalition faces an election wipeout, with climate change policy one of the biggest driving issues, said her party was in \u201clock-step\u201d behind McCormack. \u201cWhat Barnaby Joyce is saying publicly is very different to what the partyroom is saying,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we are agreed on is that we do need to back a neutral approach, a technology-neutral approach to getting reliable, baseload power into our energy system.\u201d Scott Morrison has also rejected the push for a new power station, pointing out the Queensland Labor government would never approve such a project. On McCormack\u2019s leadership, McKenzie said \u201cwe all back him to the hilt\u201d and advised fellow National MPs to \u201cfocus on the interests and needs of regional Australia\u201d. Her words were later echoed by the Victorian Nationals MP Darren Chester, who said some of his strongest supporters in his electorate were \u201cthe most vocal on environmental issues\u201d and as \u201cpractical environmentalists\u201d, expected \u201ca balanced and rational response\u201d to energy security and affordability, as well as addressing climate change. \u201cMost Gippslanders are dealing with the drought right now and they are sick of politicians talking about themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI share their frustration and refuse to be distracted by needless chatter about the leadership of the Nationals. Michael McCormack has my complete support as leader.\u201d Joyce has repeatedly made it clear he wants to return to the party leadership. He was forced to stand down after his extra-marital affair with a staffer was revealed, followed by harassment allegations, last year. An internal party investigation into the allegations was unable to come to a conclusion about the complaint. Joyce has denied he has been driving leadership tensions, saying only that he would stand if a spill was called. The battle has grown increasingly ugly, with McCormack responding to Joyce\u2019s claim the Coalition was a \u201cbusiness arrangement\u201d and not a marriage, by saying he understood what it took to make a successful marriage work. That was interpreted as a pointed slight against Joyce\u2019s personal history, given the breakdown of his long-term marriage. Even the hint of Joyce returning to the leadership before the May federal election was enough for the West Australian branch of the party, which has no seats in federal parliament, to issue a warning against any such move. The WA branch was the first to call for Joyce to step aside from the national leadership after the harassment allegations were raised. On Tuesday the state leader, Mia Davies, said Joyce would stymie any chance the branch had of sending a MP east. \u201cThe Nationals WA made their views clear on Mr Joyce\u2019s leadership in March 2018,\u201d she told the West Australian. The Liberals and Nationals are not in an official coalition in WA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
