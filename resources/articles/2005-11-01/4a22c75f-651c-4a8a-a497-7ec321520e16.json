This turns out to be one of several nightmares in which Harry foresees his forthcoming showdown with the evil Lord Voldemort, the man who killed his parents. This is soon left behind, however, for more fun and games at Hogwarts, the academy for witches and wizards that we must now recognise as a 'faith school', ready to receive the full protection of the law. Their critics, the non-magical Muggles, no longer have a place in the film series. The games in question are those of the Tri-Wizard Tournament hosted by Hogwarts with visitors from two similar institutions, the lithe Cossacks from the Durmstrang Institute and the chic French girls from the Beauxbatons Academy. The girls, mostly blonde, are white and middle class with no banlieue representatives from beyond the Periferique. They dress in powder-blue outfits and their stylised witches' hats are clearly not banned by the state. The tournament consists of three stages: fighting dragons in the air, conducting underwater rescue in waters infested by murderous mermaids, and on the ground in a menacing maze. I won't reveal who wins. The movie has even more SFX than its predecessors, and a major injection of sex, the former technically impressive if inducing more yawns than gasps, and the latter mostly relating to a grand Yule Ball on Christmas Eve. This dance, with 14-year-old girls confidently alluring in long dresses and the boys awkward in white tie and tails, seems closer to an American high school prom than anything in Britain, and is so much padding in an overlong film. The school staff is generally underused except for the new expert on curses, Professor Moody (Brendan Gleeson), an Irishman whose left eye looks like a gobstopper floating in a mini goldfish bowl. Behind it all lurks Voldemort whose last-minute appearance in the form of a nasally challenged Ralph Fiennes is something less than bloodcurdling. But Hermione Granger has the last line: 'Everything is going to change now, isn't it?' For once Ron Weasley doesn't answer 'Bloody hell!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
