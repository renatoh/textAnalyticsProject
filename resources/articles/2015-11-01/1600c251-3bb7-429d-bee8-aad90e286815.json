Islamist militants with guns and grenades had taken about 170 people hostage at the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako on Friday morning. There are conflicting reports of the death toll, though UN peacekeeping troops who entered the hotel after the siege said a preliminary search had found 27 bodies. One Belgian national and one American were confirmed as being among the dead. Two gunmen were killed, AFP quoted Mali\u2019s military as saying. Even after the last hostages were freed, Mali\u2019s security ministry said some attackers remained \u201cdug in\u201d on the upper floors. \u201cThe attackers no longer have hostages,\u201d said security ministry spokesman Amadou Sanghou. \u201cThey are dug in in the upper floors. They are alone with the Malian special forces who are trying to dislodge them.\u201d The attack began when a group of gunmen reportedly used a car with diplomatic numberplates to drive into the compound of the hotel before firing at guards, with witnesses saying they also used grenades. About 170 people \u2013 including diplomats, businesspeople and airline crew from France and Turkey \u2013 were taken hostage. A military official said the gunmen shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as they began the attack. Hotel staff said grenades were used. Malian special forces, assisted by counterparts from the US and France based in the country, stormed the hotel, and were seen on TV footage in the lobby. A security source told Reuters the troops cleared the building floor by floor. The US Africa Command said forces stationed in Mali helped to secure the scene, while France\u2019s national gendarme service said about 40 French special police forces, based in Bamako, took part in the assault on the hotel. After the raid a ministerial adviser told French TV that hostages were safe and out of the hotel. \u201cThese people have been taken under the wing of the civil authorities,\u201d the adviser was quoted as saying by AFP. Al-Mourabitoun, an African jihadi group affiliated with al-Qaida, claimed responsibility in a message posted on Twitter. The claim could not immediately be verified. Among the freed hostages was a famous Guinean singer, who told reporters he heard some of the attackers in the room next to him speaking to each other in English. \u201cI heard them say in English \u2018Did you load it?\u2019, \u2018Let\u2019s go\u2019,\u201d said S\u00e9kouba \u201cBambino\u201d Diabat\u00e9. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to see them because in these kinds of situations it\u2019s hard.\u201d The Pentagon said 22 military and civilian employees at the defence department were accounted for after the attack. Air France said 12 of its crew who were staying in the hotel were safe. It has cancelled its scheduled flights to and from Bamako for Friday. India\u2019s foreign ministry said 20 Indian nationals were among the hostages, but that they were all known to be alive. Seven Algerians, including diplomats, were trapped in a hotel, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said at least seven Chinese tourists were among those trapped inside the building. It broadcast a short video clip said to be filmed by one of the hostages. Mali\u2019s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta, was in Chad for a meeting of regional leaders, but was cutting short his trip, officials said. Mali has experienced significant activity in recent years from Islamist militant groups, who at one point seized the strategic town of Konna. This was returned to government control with the assistance of France, the the former colonial power, which launched a military offensive in 2013 at Mali\u2019s request. On Friday, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who is also dealing with the aftermath of the brutal Islamist attacks on Paris a week ago, said everything possible was being done to end the siege. France\u2019s gendarme service said about 50 specially trained police troops were en route from Paris to Bamako. The hotel is just west of the city centre in a neighbourhood with government ministries and diplomats. The Radisson attack follows a nearly 24-hour siege and hostage-taking at another hotel in August in the central Malian town of Sevare in which five UN workers were killed, along with four soldiers and four attackers. Five people, including a French citizen and a Belgian, were also killed in an attack at a restaurant in Bamako in March, in the first such incident in the capital. Both attacks were also claimed by al-Mourabitoun. Northern Mali was occupied by Islamist fighters, some with links to al-Qaida, for most of 2012. Although they were driven out by the French-led military operation, sporadic violence continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
