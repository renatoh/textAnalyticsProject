York City are heading for the Nationwide Conference and nobody connected with the club seems to have the wherewithal or financial clout to save them. Herman Hiedleburger III, your time has come. York lie bottom of the Third Division after this trouncing by Exeter, the previous occupants. The plague of lost league status has passed through Cumbria - Barrow and Workington have long departed and Carlisle look decidely peeky - and now threatens England's great cathedral cities, with Lincoln, who appropriately have risen from the dead once already, joining York and Exeter in distress. Only the affluent new towns of central and southern England seem to have in-built resistance. Exeter's recent rally owes much to Steve Perryman, the former Spur, who has pitched up in the south-west as unpaid technical adviser and even took charge of the press conference in which he loyally proclaimed: \"The spirit shows the team are still backing the manager.\" Noel Blake, nevertheless, would be foolish not to feel a little uneasy. York's chairman Douglas Craig, a solicitor absent on business in London, had lectured exasperated supporters before the match that: \"The parrot cry of 'sack the manager' is too simplistic and neither helpful not constructive.\" Nonetheless, at the final whistle 300 maroon parrots convened in the car park to squawk \"Dolan out\" - save for the few who followed Craig's advice and repeated \"sack the board\". York were so abysmal at the back that their manager Terry Dolan concluded: \"On today's evidence it's defenders we need.\" Yet they have scored only once in nine matches. Their form has even been depicted as dangerous to children. Raymond Wynn, a stalwart of the supporters' club, reflected after defeat at Scunthorpe that: \"I noticed a lot of parents with young children and it's a pity they had to witness it.\" York have fielded 11 strikers this season, many passing through on short-term contracts (they have to stay at least a month to escape the traffic jams - perhaps Mr Hiedleburger would like to build an underpass, too?) At least the latest arrival is staying until the end of the season, and has a good pedigree: Lee Nogan, capped twice for Wales and a Wembley winner with Grimsby in 1998. He should have pulled York back to 2-1 down four minutes before half-time, after Exeter's keeper, Arjan van Heusden, failed to hold Steve Agnew's shot, but he was ruled offside. York trailed inside five minutes when Christian Roberts preyed upon Mark Sertori's shocking pass, and although Neville Stamp struck the bar from 30 yards, they shipped a second when Steve Flack beat the offside trap. Flack forced in a third midway through the second half after Alan Fettis had blocked his initial shot. In the car park, one fan grabbed a BBC Radio York microphone to complain: \"I've been coming here since 1954 and it's the worst I've ever seen.\" Craig gained notoriety for refusing to support the campaign to Kick Racism Out of Football. Now York might be kicked out themselves. Some might regard that as a suitable end. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
