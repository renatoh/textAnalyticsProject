A tie would have prompted a vote-off between the two cities, with Madrid favoured to win and face London in the final round. Madrid would have been considered a bigger threat to London if they had made it through, as votes for Paris would have moved to their bid. London defeated Paris 54-50. Madrid bid representatives said they had been aware of Nikolaou's apparent blunder but that their requests for another vote had been rejected. Alejandro Blanco, head of the Spanish Olympic Committee, lamented the fact that the outcome may have hinged on a mistake by one voter. \"Talking about this now is very difficult because we are dealing with a hypothesis and we can't change what actually happened,\" he said. \"For me it is deplorable that a voting procedure of such importance, in which so many interests and so many emotions are at stake, depended on the behaviour of someone who didn't even have their mind on the job.\" Ruiz-Gallardon said the mix-up had made the city even more determined to succeed in a possible future bid. A spokeswoman for the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games said: \"There are lots of folklore stories about who voted for whom but the vote was a secret ballot. Speculating on voting processes in a secret ballot is pointless. The story is irrelevant. What matters is that London won the right to host the Games fairly and squarely.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
