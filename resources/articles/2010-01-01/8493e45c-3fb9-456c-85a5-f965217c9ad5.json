It happens spontaneously, he says, sometimes over the course of a weekend, sometimes six years after the inspiring event. For example, the 71-year-old playwright was transfixed by the Amanda Knox trial. \"She's a complete blank,\" he says. \"You can project anything on to her. Is she Henry James's Daisy Miller, an innocent young girl who goes to Europe for experience? Or is she Louise Brooks, the woman who takes what she wants and destroys everything? Or is she Nancy Drew caught up in Kafka?\" He looks through the window at a snow-bound New York. \"It's fascinating, but you can't guarantee . . . will it be a play? I have no idea.\" It is more than 25 years since Guare, while dining with friends, heard the story that would become his most successful play. Six Degrees of Separation, which opens this week at the Old Vic in London, started out as an anecdote breathlessly conveyed with the opener, \"Do we have a story for you!\" A con man had charmed his way into his friends' New York apartment and convinced them he was the son of Sidney Poitier. At the time, says Guare, it was \"an incomprehensible event\" and he forgot about it. \"Then about six years later I was writing and I realised I was writing this play. I didn't know whether Sidney Poitier did have a son, so I ran up the street to the bookstore and got his biography \u2013 no: four daughters, no son \u2013 and I put that in the play, too. It was a gift. It dictated itself. It told me what it was.\" If you had to draw a picture of a New York playwright you would draw Guare: owlish glasses, laconic air, scrutinising look, which in its baldness appears almost blank. We are in a cafe around the corner from where Guare has lived, with his wife, for 35 years, in the city he grew up in. He summers in the house his father built and is friends with people he knew when he was seven. If, says Guare, you had told him all this when he was 20, \"the geographical limitations of my life \u2013 I would have said, what went wrong? I was sure I'd go and live in California. Then I thought I'd live in London; I love London, but everyone's so polite. I missed a good fight on the subway.\" That he is still in New York would have struck him as: \"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.\" But he has come to see his security as a gift, the thing that enables his work. A typical Guare line in the forewords to his plays is: \"I could not figure out what to do with the mermaids.\" He combines the fantastic and humdrum in accordance with the Henry James principle of the \"balloon of experience\" \u2013 that is, \"an audience will go anywhere with you as long as you, the writer, keep your hand on the string. You don't want to lose the balloon. I love that image.\" Six Degrees, which opened in New York in 1990 and was later filmed, is the story not so much of the con man himself as the effect of the con on his victims, a spiky exposure of middle-class vanity in which a wealthy Manhattan couple are huckstered by the young man's proximity to celebrity and his promise to get them parts in his father's production of Cats. It is painful revisiting old plays, says Guare. Since its first run, he hasn't seen Six Degrees more than a handful of times. But he is ecstatic to be working at the Old Vic, and the play has in some ways become more relevant. \"Celebrity culture has always been there, but it formalised in 1990. Although I'm not the one to ask \u2013 a writer is like a dog, you live in an eternal present.\" (He won't update pop references in his work so that young people get them. \"I don't care,\" Guare has said. \"A play is of a time. Besides, I never know what they're talking about, so it's only fair.\") It was in his essay The War Against the Kitchen Sink that Guare laid out his artistic vision, sparked when he saw Tamburlaine as a boy and developing later against the naturalistic drama of the 1950s. He likes theatre to be theatrical \u2013 \"What Philip Sidney calls Delight and Awe. I mean, when you have that many people in a room who you're trying to blend into one person, you want to see that step into madness and joy. That's why writing plays is like blood sport: bullfighting. All the words \u2013 'We killed them last night.' Or 'The critics slaughtered us.' All words for the interaction between the audience and the stage are bloody.\" When he first saw John Osborne's Look Back in Anger, he was amazed and disappointed. \"Where is the revolution?\" he asked. Now, he says, \"What I hate about kitchen-sink dramas is [this idea] that the set is real, therefore you're going to be seeing truth. You have to earn truth. Truth can't be a part of the fact that people appear to talk that way and live in that room. You're looking for the poetry in something, and I don't mean poetry in the fancy sense. Naturalism believes by just replicating a thing you give the truth, rather than earning the truth.\" There was no question of Guare pursuing a conventional career. His father worked on Wall Street in a job he hated and told his son: \"Never get a job. Always, when you wake up, be there, doing what you do.\" After Yale he travelled and for the first time saw the dramatic potential of the place he had left. In Egypt he received a letter from his parents telling him the Pope had been to Queens \u2013 that while he was travelling the world, the world had come to them. This would eventually become his first successful play, The House of Blue Leaves, written in 1971, about a boy who wants to get himself in Time magazine by blowing up the Pope during his visit to New York. First, however, a failure: Cop-Out, a short, surreal play that flopped spectacularly. \"There's nothing like an early failure to feed all your angst. Early success is very damaging. But then you'd better get a couple of yeses along the way.\" Even off-Broadway seemed out of reach, but cafes and small venues opened up for productions in a wave of not-for-profit theatre. Edward Albee, with the profits he made from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, opened a theatre that for six months of the year put on a new play every week. There was Caffe Cino, where Al Pacino and Bernadette Peters started out, and where Guare once wrote a play on a Friday and saw it produced on the Monday. \"It was so much fun,\" he says. \"It was all a game. And then Cino stabbed himself in a suicide, 88 times. It sort of ended things.\" On the opening night of the House of Blue Leaves, Guare received a telegram from Stephen Sondheim, with whom he had done some work: \"Dear John, have a wonderful opening night, your entire future depends on it.\" He was right, says Guare. The success of the play launched him and then \"history was kind\", and 10 years later, while the play was in revival, the Pope was shot. \"My first thought was: how will this affect my play?\" Guare ran to the theatre. \"It was astonishing \u2013 before people would look at it like, who are these kooky people, and suddenly it was real. It was if a wall between the play and the audience had shattered.\" Manhattan, magic and miracles It is this intimacy he chases, the knocking down of the fourth wall by setting spectacular events against a regular background: New York, the constant in his life, the string to his balloon. The point of Six Degrees, he says, is that \"you never know what's going to happen. You never know who is going to come into your house. It's something about the compression of Manhattan, a space less than five miles by three. All walkable. London is like LA, a series of villages spread over a vast area. Manhattan is the most democratic city because everyone is in the same boat.\" He has lived here so long that when he walks around his neighbourhood it's like a diary: \"Everything has a history.\" He writes it all down because who knows what will come in handy \u2013 although, says Guare, these days it's a miracle anything gets produced. Two recent productions he loved were Beckett's Endgame with Mark Rylance, in London, and, in New York, Circle Mirror Transformation by Annie Baker. \"It sounds awful: acting classes in Vermont. But I adored it. Magic.\" Meanwhile details about Knox accrue. There are questions to ask, he says. \"Why it is you are fascinated by this? What is it telling me? Is it just because it's a three-way satanic sex ritual gone awry? Something else I wasn't invited to.\" Then again, he says, things stick for a reason. \"When the police started questioning her, her response was to do cartwheels and the splits. I love that. That's when I fell in love with the story. That's when I thought\" \u2013 he smiles, potential building \u2013 \"this is my kind of murderess.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
