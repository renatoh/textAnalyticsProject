Yet that's what happened at Edinburgh last weekend when Bernard Rose, maker of Ivans xtc, brought his latest film, The Kreutzer Sonata, for its world premiere. It seemed all the more strange when, at the Q&amp;A afterwards, Rose and his star Danny Huston found themselves being praised by a man in the cheap seats who turned out to be Sean Connery. Ivans xtc - which also starred Huston, as a Hollywood agent who finds out he's dying and realises no one will mourn him - wasn't just a serious critical hit. It was a landmark in the development of mature, high-minded digital cinema. Kreutzer is something of a follow-up: like Ivan, it is adapted from Tolstoy; like Ivan, it uses 19th-century Russian literature to illuminate a dark underside of moneyed Beverly Hills society; and like Ivan, Kreutzer was made on the cheap, with Rose shooting in friends' houses and doing all the photography and editing himself. Films this unfeted tend to get reviewers' alarm bells ringing: if no one's putting money down, it can't be any good. But Kreutzer seemed pretty special to me, easily holding its own with Ivan. So why do Tolstoy's stories work so well in a Los Angeles setting? \"There are people in Russia, like Tolstoy, for whom money is just not even an issue - because they own a village, or 100 serfs,\" says Rose, who was born in London, though now lives in LA. He certainly seems to have hit on something. Tolstoy published The Death of Ivan Ilyich (the source of Ivans xtc) in 1886, and The Kreutzer Sonata three years later. Kreutzer was conceived as a literary response to Beethoven's legendary sonata. Its investigation of marital infidelity and jealousy made it instantly controversial, and the work was banned, available only in illicit copies for many years. \"What's so scary about Tolstoy,\" says Rose, \"is his ability to analyse his own emotions with such accuracy that you recognise them in yourself. Ivan's theme was very simple: the existential fear of dying. Kreutzer has the same kind of power, but it's about sex and love. Tolstoy was writing with a very 19th-century perspective, before Freud or psychoanalysis or any honest investigation of sexual practices. It struck me how modern it is. So when it came to the sex scenes, I really wanted it to nfeel like they were just fucking.\" Here, he has certainly succeeded. His leads, Huston and Elisabeth R\u00f6hm (more familiar as one of the DAs in Law and Order), are filmed in unforgiving closeup. Nor does Rose hold back with the spurting blood when it comes to the denouement. \"It's exactly the way Tolstoy described it!\" he says. Rose remains a big flag-waver for digital cinema, forcefully aware of the industry truism that keeping things cheap allows directors to tackle serious, high-common-denominator material: \"You can get an awfully long way down the line without spending a lot of money.\" He was saying the same thing eight years ago when Ivans xtc came out, but has now seen his point, and his approach, widely accepted. \"When I shot Ivan, people just thought I was mad. Now, they just don't even mention it.\" Rose's most remarkable achievement as a film-maker has been, essentially, to enlarge the vocabulary of the digital world. The first successes of this genre - Festen, The Idiots, The Blair Witch Project - exploited the lightweight, mobile cameras, creating a jittery, near-documentary idiom for the format. With Ivans xtc and The Kreutzer Sonata, Rose has developed a harsh, sombrely paced style that should give hope to purists, who might have felt that such an approach could lead only to obsolescence. It doesn't, however, appear to have been born out of any high-minded crusade. Rose has a curious magpie quality: he has been equally proficient in straightahead horror (with 1992's breakthrough movie Candyman), or heavyweight costume stuff (with yet another Tolstoy adaptation, his Anna Karenina from 1994, starring Sophie Marceau). His last horror, Snuff Movie, got a toxic reaction from critics. Rose doesn't seem to mind: \"It was a movie designed to get bad reviews, so you can't complain when it does.\" Right now, he's more interested in the current state of Hollywood, saying, \"The films this summer were so tepid, they weren't even horrible enough to get annoyed about.\" And he's got a good line on the current enthusiasm for 3D: \"I predict the death of the flat blockbuster. Soon they're going to be like silent movies.\" All the talk after Ivans xtc was that Rose had terminally offended the Hollywood hierarchy with his gruesome view of the agent's life. \"People have such short memories,\" he says. \"No one could care less any more.\" So that's not why he hasn't worked in the mainstream for a while? \"It isn't that I can't get hired by a studio. It's more to do with things that were going on in my life. They don't care - they all have rows with everybody. If there's a person they haven't had a row with, it's because they haven't met them yet\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
