Which is why George Kruis will leave a more sizeable hole than some might think should next Saturday\u2019s Six Nations fixture against Wales be his last appearance for England before he heads in an alternative direction. There is no confirmation as yet but, with the Italy game in Rome threatened by the coronavirus outbreak and a big-money offer from Japan on the table, it is no secret that Kruis, now 30, is pondering a life beyond Saracens and the national team. Having invested in setting up a company which sells cannabis oil to help athletes relax and sleep better, his post-rugby plans are already well-advanced. The stats say England will miss him when he does go \u2013 of the 28 Tests he has started England have lost only four \u2013 and longstanding teammates such as Jamie George say his influence stretches way beyond his lineout expertise. \u201cEveryone looks at his lineout \u2013 he\u2019s a nause, a guru, whatever you want to call it he\u2019s brilliant \u2013 but he works incredibly hard on his all-round game. He is one of the hardest-working players you will find \u2026 in terms of standard-setting you don\u2019t need to look much further than him.\u201d Not many at Saracens, when they first saw him as a gangling youth, envisaged him winning 45 caps for England and a Lions starting Test jersey against New Zealand in 2017. \u201cI remember him joining Saracens as an 18-year-old,\u201d recalls George. \u201cHe\u2019d have to drive from Dorking every morning, getting up at 5am, and I think he was 90 kilos. He was awful, nothing short of that, a bad rugby player. Everyone was like: \u2018Are we just handing trials out? He\u2019s a competition winner?\u2019 Then he gets in the gym and you see how hard he works. He\u2019s squeezed the most out of his career he possibly could.\u201d Every good team needs a \u201cglue\u201d player who hits endless rucks, does all the other unglamorous tasks and consistently puts his body on the line for the cause. Kruis has been receiving slightly less praise for his attempted clearance kick against Ireland last week \u2013 \u201cIt was terrible, the worst thing he\u2019s ever done on a rugby field, which is saying something,\u201d suggests George \u2013 but otherwise he \u201cmassively enjoyed\u201d being part of a mostly dominant English pack. Such experiences will be hard to replicate but Kruis insists he will not be overwhelmed by extra emotion before what could be his Twickenham swansong. \u201cIt\u2019s always emotional playing for England. It is an absolute privilege, something myself and definitely my family and my friends really enjoy. \u201cIt is tough [to weigh up what to do next]. But it is extremely exciting on all fronts. If I stay it\u2019s an unbelievable opportunity, if I go it is also a great opportunity. I need to sit down and have a proper think once we have finished up the Six Nations.\u201d Given England currently boast an enviable array of second-rows, with Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury and Charlie Ewels all vying for places, the temptation to bow out at the top is obvious. There is also the small matter of Saracens\u2019s relegation from the Premiership and the looming prospect of Championship rugby for their England stars next season. Either way, Kruis\u2019s priority is next Saturday \u2013 \u201cWales don\u2019t give up, we\u2019ll be focusing on discipline throughout the game\u201d \u2013 when he is unlikely to do any more kicking. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be doing that again. It was on, it was just an execution error. We\u2019ve reviewed it as a team. I should probably have stuck to my skillset.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
