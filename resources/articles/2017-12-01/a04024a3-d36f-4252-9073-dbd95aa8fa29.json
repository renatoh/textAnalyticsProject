That should have said about three heaped tbsp (What\u2019s Kuchen?, 25 November, page 4, Cook). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Christians should pray for Prince George to be gay, says minister As an actor, Meghan Markle comes from a long line of trailblazing women Refugee MP Golriz Ghahraman on love, loathing and entering New Zealand politics Historians working towards a full imperial reckoning for Britain"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
