Labor also says the documents seized by police overnight are covered by parliamentary privilege, because Conroy was sitting on a senate committee enquiring into the mismanagement of the National Broadband Network (NBN), so the AFP\u2019s investigation will have to be on hold for some time anyway. Andrew Colvin, AFP commissioner, said on Friday morning that the AFP\u2019s investigation and raids had been undertaken independently of government, and he flatly rejected accusations of political interference. \u201cThere has been no influence, no influence on the AFP in the conduct of this investigation,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cIn fact, the government first became aware of this investigation shortly after the commencement of the operational activity yesterday.\u201d He also said police could no longer access the documents that were seized overnight because parliamentary privilege had been claimed on them. \u201cAs documents are sealed, the AFP does not have access to the documents. They will be lodged in the Senate and a process will be put into play by the parliament to determine if parliamentary privilege is afforded to those documents,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it is not necessarily the case that parliamentary privilege will be afforded to those documents.\u201d The AFP warrant, seen by the Guardian Australia, shows officers were seeking documents or other material relating to the NBN which it believes were handed to Labor staffer Andrew Byrne from an \u201cas yet unidentified commonwealth officer,\u201d between 1 August 2014 and 27 February 2016. The warrant names the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review, the Australian, and the ABC, as media outlets that have published stories containing leaked material. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the AFP\u2019s investigation raised serious questions because it was started at the behest of NBN Co, which is a government agency. \u201cWhat we need to know is, what did the PM or his ministers, or their staff, have to do with the commencement of this investigation and what do they know about that?\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cHas the PM or his ministers or their staff had conversations with executives of NBN Co, a Government agency I would stress again, about the conduct of this investigation and [have they] sought updates from NBN Co?\u201d He also said the investigation raised serious questions about whistleblower protection. \u201cIt\u2019s now become apparent that this search warrant process is directed not merely at opposition frontbenchers and their staff, but directed also at the media. It raises questions about not only the public\u2019s right to know, but the right of the media to publish,\u201d he said. On Thursday night, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the raids were \u201centirely a matter for the AFP\u201d. \u201cThey operate entirely independent of government and the Labor Party knows that as well as I do,\u201d Turnbull said. But on Friday, Dreyfus said the raids were a very bad look for the government and the AFP, raising serious questions about political interference in federal police matters. \u201cWe\u2019re in the second week of an eight-week election campaign, the police must know that,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cThey should have, I think, thought more and been more cautious about what the appearance of this might have been, because there are obvious political connotations. It is obviously something that is directed at a Labor shadow minister and a Labor staffer,\u201d he said. \u201cAt all times we need to make that the Australian Federal Police and all our agencies are absolutely independent of political interference ... we also need to be concerned about the \u201cappearance\u201d of police work,\u201d he said. The shadow finance minister, Penny Wong, said the issue of parliamentary privilege was \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d to consideration of this matter. \u201cWhat does parliamentary privilege go to? It goes to ensuring a parliamentarian can do their job, can shine a light on the truth ... free from government interference with their work,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIt is a critical part of our democracy and it is a protection which is applied under the Westminster system for a very long time.\u201d Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said on Friday morning it was \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d that the AFP left one staffer\u2019s home just half an hour earlier. \u201cWhat that means is that it has been quite an extraordinary raid, over an extensive period of time, in extraordinary circumstances during an election campaign,\u201d he told the Nine Network. Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne said the government found out about the raids after they began, and accused Labor of trying to politicise the AFP investigation. The idea that the AFP would time its raid on Senator Conroy\u2019s office and Labor staffers was \u201cnothing short of loopy\u201d, Pyne said. \u201cIf you are suggesting that the government has organised raids by the AFP against the Labor party, that is an extraordinary allegation,\u201d he said. On Friday, the former Liberal party leader John Hewson said the Labor party would milk this event for all its worth because it would take the attention away from the embarrassing revelations about David Feeney\u2019s negative gearing In a statement on Thursday, the NBN Co confirmed it was assisting the AFP with an \u201congoing investigation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
