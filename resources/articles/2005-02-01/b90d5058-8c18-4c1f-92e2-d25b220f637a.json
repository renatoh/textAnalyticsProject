Stewart Downing could give England width and penetration for the next decade but, first things first, his international career will be ushered in gently this evening, with a substitute's shirt and little time to show off his precocious talents. England have thrown a protective cloak around the 20-year-old Downing in the same way that Everton once did with Wayne Rooney and Manchester United felt necessary to do with Ryan Giggs. Eriksson has resisted the public clamour to see Middlesbrough's most prized asset in the starting XI against Holland tonight and when Downing gave his first interview yesterday it was a gentle question-and-answer session with the Football Association's own website rather than a face-to-face meeting with the press pack. Downing, however, already seems equipped to cope with the pressure. He earned spontaneous applause for one crisp finish here in training in Ashby de la Zouch and, to the surprise of nobody at his club, Middlesbrough, he has quickly acclimatised to the new surroundings. \"He's coped with every circumstance and every environment in which he's played,\" said Dave Parnaby, the club's academy coach. \"He's just a good kid. Despite everything that's happening to him now, he'll not be running around telling everyone. He'll just get on with his day-to-day work.\" Downing certainly seems relaxed enough. \"Sven has been very nice,\" he politely offered. \"When I arrived he came over, welcomed me and said, 'Just enjoy yourself, be yourself and make sure the lads look after you'. Shaun Wright-Phillips came up to introduce himself to me straight away and I know people like Wayne Rooney from when we were in the England Under-19s squad. I just want to get out there now.\" If Eriksson is looking for clues to Downing's personality the early indications are promising. Like every successful player he oozes self-belief, but he manages to do so in a manner that does not suggest a hint of arrogance. He even suspected he might be the victim of a hoax when Michelle Farrer, the England team's administrator, informed him he had won his first call-up to the senior squad. \"I was sure it was a wind-up,\" he said. \"I thought the squad was going to be announced at 7pm but then I got a text message at 6.30pm. It was so early I had to ring the number to check.\" The million-dollar question is whether he will flourish or wilt under the pressure of being likened to Giggs. It is an easy tag to give him but a lazy one, too. Downing lists Giggs among his favourite players, but there are differences in style. Whereas Giggs has based his career on the ability to run with the ball at a speed that can trouble the most accomplished full-back, Downing does not find it an irresistible challenge to beat his marker. He is a capable dribbler but his strength is knowing when to play the ball and having the ability to land it exactly where he wants to, whether it be a tantalising cross or a sweet shot at goal. On that count he might even be more naturally gifted than Giggs, whose crossing can be erratic. \"Stewart was always very talented technically and had that innate ability to run quickly with the ball,\" said Parnaby. \"That's his strength, what he does the best, and he has a fantastic ability to cross the ball. \"That was what everybody admired about him: his ability to receive, to turn, to run with the ball and to cross. He's got a fantastic vision to see passes of every length, short passing and long passing. He's very steady and thorough in his preparation. He's well-mannered, he does everything right and he's a good professional.\" He is also a key part of England's planning for the next decade, even before he has kicked a ball in anger. \"He's young, a big talent . . . and he's left-footed as well,\" said a wide-eyed Eriksson, as if he had accidentally discovered a rare species. With Wright-Phillips on the right and Downing on the left, wingers are fashionable once again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
