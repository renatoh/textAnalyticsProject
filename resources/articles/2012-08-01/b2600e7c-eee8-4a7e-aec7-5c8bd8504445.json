Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, members of the Sikh faith were targeted in isolated incidents of violence by racists who blamed them for the atrocities conducted by a handful of extremist from a different religion. Occasional attacks continue to take place. But Sikh leaders urged followers of the faith to wait until the police investigation before making any assumption as to the gunman's motive. Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition \u2013 the faith's largest civil rights organisation in the US \u2014 said: \"There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case.\" \"As new facts emerge, the dialogue can change,\" Kaur said, adding: \"Americans died today in a senseless act of violence and Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters.\" The Sikh Coalition noted that the Gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin has been on site since 1997 and has over 400 members. During those 15 years, the temple has made a valued contribution to both the Sikh and the wider community, the civil rights group said. Oak Creek alderman Dan Jakubczyk said there has never been any problem involving members of the temple, adding: \"They've been a plus to this city and to my district.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
