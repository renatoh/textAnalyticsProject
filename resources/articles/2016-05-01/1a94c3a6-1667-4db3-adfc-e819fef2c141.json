The provocative poster of the North Korean leader is overlaid with the words \u201cA surveillance camera in our phones? Way to go Britain.\u201d Other posters in the campaign satirise the Russian, Chinese and Zimbawe presidents \u2013 Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Robert Mugabe respectively. The investigatory powers bill authorises a series of snooping powers for the intelligence services and police. Its passage through parliament has so far been relatively trouble-free, with Labour and the Scottish National party abstaining from a vote despite concerns about an invasion of privacy. The posters have been created by a coalition of rights groups, called Don\u2019t Spy On Us, and, though satirical, are aimed at making a serious point about the erosion of civil liberties. Eric King, the director of Don\u2019t Spy On Us, said: \u201cThe UK government should be leading the way in guaranteeing safe and secure communications for everyone. Instead it is providing examples for dictators across the world. \u201cWhen China introduced controversial sweeping surveillance powers just a few months ago, its government claimed it was doing \u2018basically the same as what other major countries in the world do\u2019. Oppressive regimes are already following our lead.\u201d The words overlaying Putin\u2019s face read: \u201cA government that spies on citizens. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d Xi\u2019s reads: \u201cWell done, Britain. No one monitors their people quite like you.\u201d The posters are being placed in newspapers including the Guardian, and on billboards. In what is believed to be the first such legal challenge to the authority of the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT), the campaign group Privacy International has launched a judicial review of the IPT\u2019s judgment this year that found \u201cthematic warrants\u201d authorising hacking by GCHQ were legal. There is no right of appeal within the UK against IPT rulings, although the investigatory powers bill plans to introduce such a procedure. The IPT hears complaints about abuse of surveillance powers by government agencies. Scarlet Kim, legal officer at Privacy International, said: \u201cThe IPT\u2019s decision grants the government carte blanche to hack hundreds or thousands of people\u2019s computers and phones with a single warrant. \u201cGeneral warrants permit GCHQ to target an entire class of persons or property without proving to a judge that each person affected is suspected of a crime or a threat to national security. By sanctioning this power, the IPT has upended 250 years of common law that makes clear such warrants are unlawful. \u201cCombined with the power to hack, these warrants represent an extraordinary expansion of state surveillance capabilities with alarming consequences for the security of our devices and the internet.\u201d Privacy International\u2019s challenge will be heard in the high court if judges consider they have the jurisdiction to hear it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
