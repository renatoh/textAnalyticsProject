The gyms insist the regulations should not apply to them and have risked fines of up to \u00a310,000 to stay open, after a campaign to have an exemption inserted into the law failed on Wednesday. \u201cGyms protect the NHS. We\u2019re in a health pandemic, and I believe that during this time we should be doing everything we can to get people healthier and fitter,\u201d said Alex Lowndes, the owner of Gainz. Lowndes said two Gainz Fitness and Strength sites \u2013 one in Bedford and the other St Neots, in Cambridgeshire \u2013 were still open on Thursday. The business had had four visits from police and one from environmental health during the morning, Lowndes said, and at least half a dozen police were gathered in the car park of his Bedfordshire premises. Later in the afternoon, Bedfordshire police confirmed they and the local council had ordered the gym to close and fined three members. Lowndes insisted his motivation was not money, saying he was no longer accepting new memberships. \u201cIt\u2019s become very clear that obesity is the biggest vulnerability [for people with Covid. The prime minister himself said that. So why are we not doing anything about it? All the government\u2019s done about it so far is given us half-price cheeseburgers,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme. \u201cI believe that what we\u2019re doing by staying open is protecting people with mental and physical health.\u201d Lowndes added that gyms were increasingly important as the nights draw in, particularly to women because they provide a safer environment in which to exercise than poorly lit parks. Others said their activities had not yet attracted the attention of the authorities. Jayne Deakin, who runs a fitness studio in Bury, Greater Manchester, said she had decided to stay open and risk the hefty fine, which she could not afford. She claimed the risk was minimal because she dealt with regular clients, and she had operated for 110 days without a positive test. There was a similar story at Majestic Gym in Wigan, which said it had followed through on its vow to open on Thursday and had not been visited by the authorities by the early afternoon. The College of Policing said police would only enforce rules applying to businesses as a last resort, saying it would leave it to local government in the first instance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
