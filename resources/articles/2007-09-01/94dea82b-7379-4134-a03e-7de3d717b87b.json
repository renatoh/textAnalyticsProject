Fortunes have transformed for Scotland these past three years, but fatalism remains embedded in the fabric of a nation yearning for its return to centre stage. Beyond the hypothetical debate over the exclusion of James McFadden and Shaun Maloney and a ponderous start to the second half against Lithuania, the bottom line produced few grounds for Scottish complaint. Tomorrow they travel to France elevated to second in Group B, one point and a place above Italy. The reigning world champions, along with Ukraine, dropped two valuable points on Saturday, while Thierry Henry collected the booking that suspends him from a revenge mission at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. This, surely, is a moment to savour. The added bonuses from the San Siro arrived long after the lights had gone out here and Scotland do not suddenly arrive in Paris expecting to repeat October's 1-0 defeat of Raymond Domenech's team on the basis of Henry's ineligibility. But there is a substance to their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign that that was brielfy undermined when the Slovenian referee Damir Skomina awarded Lithuania an outrageous penalty from which they equalised, and waiting for the worst is no way to approach the four remaining fixtures that will decide Scotland's fate. When the captain Tomas Danilevicius cancelled out Kris Boyd's opener there was a collective seizure around the Clyde; that familiar sense that optimism would be dismantled by blatant injustice. Even when McLeish's men proved otherwise, the theatrics of Hearts' midfielder Saulius Mikoliunas remained the dominant post-match theme, to the understandable chagrin of the victorious manager. \"We've got to change the Scottish psyche away from glorious failure,\" said McLeish, in response to a suggestion it would have been \"typical\" of Scotland to falter in a must-win game in such a fashion. \"From kids all the way up, we need to work on confidence that things don't always have to go pear-shaped.\" That process has evidently commenced with McLeish and his players, whose bold response to Mikoliunas' dive over the planted foot of Darren Fletcher brought deserved reward. Having lauded Scotland's belief before kick-off, it did not fit with McLeish's clarion call to see McFadden and Maloney, two of his more expressive talents, start as substitutes against weaker opposition. It was to the manager's blessed relief that both made am impressive impact when called upon. With his first touch, from Fletcher's short corner, Maloney dissected the Lithuanian penalty area for Stephen McManus to convert at the back post. Seven minutes from time the Everton forward polished his manager's substitution policy with an immaculate strike into the top corner. \"If we qualify it will be the best achievement ever,\" admitted McLeish. \"The top 10 teams in the world are very difficult to beat and Italy and France, and maybe Ukraine too, feel they're in that group. Their mindset is they'll not drop points to anyone but others in that elite. Possibly, France felt that losing to Scotland was a huge shock but our lads' confidence will be tremendous going over there.\" The Scotland manager insisted it would be \"suicidal\" to persist with 4-4-2 against the French, although that did not stop Mikoliunas from venturing into similar territory with the undisguised celebrations that followed his prosperous simulation. \"I hope the crowd get on to him when he's back in the SPL,\" said Jay McEveley, the young Scotland left-back. Gordon, the Lithuanian's former team-mate at Tynecastle, said: \"I would have shaken his hand at the end. He was doing what he felt was right for his country. It is part of the game. Whether it is right or wrong is another matter. If you have a chance to get your team back into a European Championship qualifier by doing that then you're going to do it. They were lucky to get the decision but if we win 1-0 in Paris on Wednesday night with a decision like that then I don't think people will be complaining.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
