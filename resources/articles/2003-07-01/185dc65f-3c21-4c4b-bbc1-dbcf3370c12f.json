The three-year-olds of 2003, though, are beginning to look like a lost generation. \"Tell me a three-year-old that's been impressive this year,\" Pat Eddery said after steering the veteran Millenary to victory in the Princess Of Wales's Stakes. \"I can't think of one.\" Nor could anyone else. High Accolade, who looked a colt of real promise at Royal Ascot, was the first horse beaten in yesterday's race. Two members of the Classic generation, Alamshar and Kris Kin, still head the betting for the King George at Ascot later this month, but Eddery is now convinced that Millenary could provide him with the Group One victory he craves in his final season in the saddle. \"These older horses are good, honest and consistent,\" he said. \"I think the three-year-olds are going to have a hell of a job with them. His form has been top-class this year, and he picked them up really well today. This is only his third race of the season, so he's fresh, and he finished fifth in the King George two years ago when the ground was too firm for him.\" The going will probably need to be no firmer than good if Millenary is to run in the King George, which does little to recommend his general price of 14-1 ante-post. At least his price is going in the right direction, though, unlike the odds against Bollin Eric, the third horse home yesterday. He is out to 20-1 for Ascot having been as short as 12-1. \"He would really like some proper rain if he is going to run at Ascot,\" John Dunlop, Millenary's trainer, said. \"It would be tough for him but we would go there with nothing to lose.\" The fizz of youth on the three-day meeting's opening card was provided by the two-year-old filly Attraction, who burst clear a furlong from home in the Cherry Hinton Stakes and remains unbeaten after five outings. Not everything unfolded as expected, though, as Attraction was checked slightly on leaving the stalls and then had to wait for a gap to appear against the far rail. As soon as she saw daylight, though, Attraction was away. It will be a major surprise if an imminent step up to Group One level proves beyond her. \"I would say she's as good a filly as I've sat on,\" Kevin Darley, Attraction's jockey, said. \"Today I learned a lot more about her, that she's not all speed and she can switch off and settle. Today, the further she went, the better she was.\" Whether that speed will stretch to a mile in the 1,000 Guineas next year is another matter, although Coral make her their 12-1 favourite for the Classic (from 25-1). The knowledge that Attraction stays six furlongs well does open up plenty of possibilities for this season, however. Winning trainer Mark Johnston said: \"We were looking at the Nunthorpe and the Prix Robert Papin because we were thinking of five furlongs and we wanted to go Group One and there weren't any alternatives. \"Now there are numerous alternatives. She'll still be entered in the Lowther and the Nunthorpe [at York's Ebor meeting], but looking beyond that there's also the Cheveley Park.\" Another six-furlong event, the wild dash down the hill at Goodwood for the Stewards' Cup, will be on the mind of Roger Charlton, the trainer of Move It, after his sprinter won the Showcase Handicap from Baltic King. \"I think in this sort of company he is better at six furlongs than five,\" said Charlton. \"I probably got the insructions wrong at Ascot when I told the jockey to jump him out and bowl along. He travelled very well in behind today.\" Move It is now 12-1 (from 16-1) with Coral to follow up in Sussex later this month. Dazzling Bay, the unplaced favourite, is 10-1 from 7-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
