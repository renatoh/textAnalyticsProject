Rangers prepared to entertain Paris St-Germain with a hugely impressive 4-0 victory over Dunfermline in which Tore Andre Flo and Shota Arveladze both scored twice. \"We enjoyed that,\" Claudio Reyna declared. \"And now we have PSG followed by Celtic, so it is a huge week that we are all looking forward to.\" Celtic, however, scrambled a 1-0 win over Hearts at Tynecastle courtesy of a Henrik Larsson penalty but paid a heavy price with a seemingly serious knee injury to Didier Agathe that will keep him out of their Uefa Cup trip to Valencia and quite possibly considerably longer. The injury was sustained in a shocking tackle from the young defender Andy Webster, who afterwards took full blame. \"I can only apologise to Didier,\" he said. \"No player sets out to hurt another and I'm desperately sorry he's out of Celtic's European tie. It was a reckless challenge and all I can do is put it down to inexperience.\" Celtic's manager Martin O'Neill was also preoccupied by the problem. \"It looks bad because there is swelling on both sides of the knee,\" he said. Elsewhere Aberdeen maintained their impressive run with another home victory, their seventh in a row, beating Hibernian 2-0 with late goals from Robbie Winters and Hicham Zerouali, while high-flying Livingston continued to surprise all and sundry as Barry Wilson's goal was enough to beat Dundee. Kilmarnock had their young strikers Kris Boyd and Paul Di Giacomo to thank for a much needed 2-0 victory over Motherwell and Dundee United halted St Johnstone's mini-revival when Jim Hamilton scored the winner after a goal from Hasney Aljofree had been cancelled out by Paddy Connolly's strike for Saints. It was an entertaining Premier League afternoon but one not without controversy with five players sent off in the six matches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
