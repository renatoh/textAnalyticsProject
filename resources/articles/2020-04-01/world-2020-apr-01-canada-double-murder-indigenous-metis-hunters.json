The bodies of Jake Sansom, 39, and his uncle Morris Cardinal, 57, were found early on 28 March beside Sansom\u2019s pickup truck on a country road near Glendon, a farming town 160 miles north-east of Edmonton. Both had gunshot wounds. Sansom, who recently lost his job as a heavy-machinery mechanic due to coronavirus-related layoffs, was out hunting with Cardinal to help provide food for family members. After successfully shooting a moose, which promised a bountiful supply of meat, the two took a selfie, smiling in the woods. Both men were M\u00e9tis \u2013 a distinct group that traces lineage to both Indigenous nations and European settlers \u2013 and had permission to hunt the area out of season. News of the murders has shocked friends and family. \u201cAll the kids in the community loved him and everyone knew who he was, knew he had a heart of gold and would give the shirt off his back for anyone,\u201d Sarah Sansom said of her husband in a statement. A volunteer firefighter, he left behind three young children. \u201cFirefighter Sansom was always willing to be involved in the dept, community, fundraisers, and continually showed his love for his family and fellow firefighters,\u201d the Nobleford fire department said in a Facebook post. Cardinal, a keen hunter and outdoorsman, had three stepchildren and five grandchildren. \u201cOne day I was complaining about my feet being cold and the next morning he showed up with a nice warm pair of brand new socks for me! Took them straight from his stash of socks,\u201d Anna Thompson, who previously worked with Cardinal, told the National Post. The results of an autopsy conducted on the two men on Tuesday 31 March were not made public. The RCMP declined to provide information on the number or nature of gunshot wounds, citing a need to \u201cpreserve the integrity\u201d of the investigation. Police have said they believe the men were ambushed at a junction \u2013 but cautioned the investigation was in its preliminary stages. The RCMP said there was no evidence at this point that suggested the killings were racially motivated. Police have appealed to anyone with dashboard or trail camera footage from the area to come forward. \u201cI just don\u2019t get why somebody could murder two people for no reason like that,\u201d Michel Sansom, Jake\u2019s brother, told CBC News. \u201cThey didn\u2019t rob them. The cops said nothing was missing. They pulled up just to kill them, just because. I just don\u2019t understand that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
