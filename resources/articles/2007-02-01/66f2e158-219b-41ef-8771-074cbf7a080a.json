There are now a thousand more mosques, companies that do nothing but design them, and plans to build a \"mega-mosque\" to hold 40,000 worshippers in east London. Is there anything like a \"British style\" of mosque, to match the Ottoman and Moorish predecessors? What do the people who live near these buildings, Muslim and non-Muslim, think of them? Architectural historian Joe Kerr investigates in The British Mosque (11am, Radio 4). Should you listen to Heads You Win, Tails I Lose (2.15pm, Radio 4)? The fitting way to decide would be by flipping a coin. Paul Kesterton's play, which must surely have been inspired by Luke Rhinehart's The Dice Man, focuses on a young man called Nigel, who has a dead-end job waiting tables in a cafe in Bristol. He has just been kicked out of the band he started with his schoolmates when he spots the beautiful Kat, alone at a table and spinning coins. This, she tells him, is how she makes big decisions - and before long they are vandalising cars, stealing from employers and romping in cathedrals, all because the dice told them to.
