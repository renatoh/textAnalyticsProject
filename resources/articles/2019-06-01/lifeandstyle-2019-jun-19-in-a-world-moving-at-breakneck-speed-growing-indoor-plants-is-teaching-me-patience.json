They have been there since April, when I was seized by some primal urge (home ownership, perhaps?) and decided I wanted to grow my own. I got so excited when I saw a taproot growing from the bottom of one seed. It was happening! I lost myself in fantasies of huge, glossy houseplants. But then \u2026 nothing. I\u2019m not a patient person. As a child, I once cried on Christmas night because it wouldn\u2019t be Christmas again for another whole year. I rage against the grinding travesty of the NBN. I sigh heavily when it turns out I\u2019ve chosen the slow-moving supermarket lane. At bus stops, the minutes drag by like aeons. My avocado was no magic bean; rationally I knew it could take months to sprout. Yet I still managed to feel disappointed that the taproot hadn\u2019t immediately presaged a cavalcade of growth. Had the seedling failed? The other seed hadn\u2019t sprouted at all. Still, that primal urge hadn\u2019t quite gone away. In mid-May, as the taproot blackened and the wineglass water grew cloudy, I took two branch cuttings from the apple tree in my backyard, snipping them just below a growth node, at a 45-degree angle. I stripped the bark from the bottom inch of the cutting, and spat on the raw wood. I\u2019d read human saliva is a natural rooting hormone, and I liked the witchiness of giving something of myself to the cutting. But I dipped the moistened cuttings in commercial rooting hormone, just to be sure. I planted the cuttings in a damp blend of vermiculite and potting mix, topped with an insulating layer of moss \u2013 also harvested from my back yard. I enclosed them in bells made from cut-down plastic bottles. You\u2019re meant to keep the cuttings out of direct sunlight, so I put them in my bathroom. I misted them occasionally with a spray bottle. Then I waited. Impatience can be an adaptive response to chaotic, anxious environments; my body feels the urgency of a world moving at eschatological speed, and wants to act. A fist grips my chest from the inside, sending my hands and teeth into an answering clench. My limbs fizz with restraint: a leashed dog, a reined horse, a car revving in neutral. I look at my cuttings and pips, those stubbornly inert sticks and stones, thinking: come on! Come on! Winter isn\u2019t the best time to grow plants. But I don\u2019t have a choice: the boomer who owns my home is renovating, and in two months I\u2019ll have to leave my beautiful garden with its apple tree. The thought chills me with despair. Everything I\u2019ve read suggests apple cuttings don\u2019t take well. But nor does the insecurity of inner-city renting. Houseplants don\u2019t just clean the air; they offer a sense of domestic stability and continuity. Winter, in the west, is often depicted as metonymically hopeless. The sweltering spectre of global heating may stalk the contemporary imaginary, but back in the cold war people feared slow famine in a nuclear winter. But winter is also a patient time. A metamorphic time, when nature quietly gathers within itself. Christina Rossetti dramatises the wondrous birth of Christ \u201cin the bleak midwinter\u201d, when \u201cEarth stood hard as iron, water like a stone\u201d. Only something miraculous can overcome such relentlessness: \u201cSnow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow.\u201d In Wurundjeri country where I live, it\u2019s the season of waring, the wombat. The slow-moving marsupials emerge to bask in the crisp sunlight that peels away the morning frosts. In the misty hills, the Wurundjeri feasted in winter on tender hearts of kombadik, tree ferns. I bought a sad, mostly dead fern from the Bunnings discount trolley because it had a few furled fronds I hoped might grow. What I love about ferns is their resilience. But for weeks, this one remained stubbornly unchanged. Then, it began. The smallest frond had unfurled, and a new frond was heaving the potting mix, a tiny green fist. It was giving me Rossetti\u2019s gift: its heart. I lifted the bell from an apple twig and joy bloomed in me like the swelling bud I saw. I rejoiced to see white roots uncurling, finger-like, from the avocado\u2019s taproot, and a stem bursting like newborn Athena from the seed\u2019s crown. My plants remind me that my impatience is really a feeling of disempowerment \u2013 my inability to control the pace, and place, of my own life. My joy in them reminds me that good things can happen with time, and care. So I tend my leafless apple twigs, and imagine their roots unfurling slowly, slowly in the dark soil. Like the fern fronds and avocado roots. Like hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
