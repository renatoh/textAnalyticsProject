The Guardian went to the high court today to overturn an injunction obtained by the former servant on Monday, which grants him anonymity in his proceedings against another newspaper. But the press was asked to leave the court after Desmond Browne QC, on behalf of the former servant, argued that if the hearing were held in public someone might inadvertently let slip an important piece of information. The judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat, an advocate of open justice, said freedom of expression needed to be taken into consideration. However, he agreed Mr Browne could make an application to continue an injunction against the Guardian in private. \"This is an application for an injunction to be continued against a newspaper. It obviously engages the right of freedom of expression and it appears from the attendance in court that it's attracting a certain amount of public interest,\" Mr Tugendhat said. He added he was reluctant to order that the whole hearing should be conducted in private. \"If the court is going to restrain a publication, the reasons why it does so are a matter of law, themselves a matter of public interest,\" the judge said. Mr Browne said: \"The problem is, leaving aside matters which, were they to be mentioned in open court would defeat the whole object of the exercise, there's also the risk that one may let slip something. \"It's an intimidating prospect to have to be always thinking about what one is saying with an eye to what is appearing in the media.\" \"I entirely accept what your lordship says about this engaging freedom of expression,\" Mr Browne said. However, he added there also existed a right to reputation and to a private and family life. The original injunction, preventing the Guardian from revealing the name of a former royal servant who had taken out an injunction against the Mail on Sunday, was granted at around 7.10pm on Monday by Mr Justice Henriques. The Guardian was not seeking to report the contents of the Mail on Sunday's report but only to disclose who had sought to prevent publication. The Mail on Sunday ran a front-page story last week saying a former palace servant had prevented it from publishing lengthy interviews with a second former royal servant, whose story was supported by a sworn affidavit. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
