Yesterday's comprehensive defeat at the hands of India A completed a 3-0 whitewash in the one-day series and provoked more terse observations from Marsh, whose dual role as Academy director and national selector makes him doubly sensitive to failure. Asked if he thought his charges had made any progress, he replied: \"Yes. Backwards.\" Sajid Mahmood and Simon Jones might disagree. Mahmood took three wickets in his first five overs to lend credibility to his claim that he is ready for senior duty in the Caribbean. And Jones continued his comeback with 10 nippy overs for 39, figures which were not flattered by a couple of thin edges for four. The real test for his right knee begins here tomorrow, when England begin their warm-up for the first-class Duleep Trophy with a four-day game against Tamil Nadu. Even so, 20 overs in two games for 84 runs, plus a few up-and-at-'em verbals, represents an encouraging return from serious injury. After winning their third toss in a row, England squandered the start made by Scott Newman of Surrey and Ed Smith; the Kent man batted with more common sense than anyone to make an unbeaten 76 and remind the selectors of his existence. But from 141 for two the Academy lost eight for 69, including three players caught and bowled. England's inability to bat through the middle overs against the spinners has been their biggest failing all week. Set 211 on another ideal batting strip, India A were in disarray at 34 for four after a classy spell from Mahmood, who models himself on Glenn McGrath and has the snarl to match. He is fast, hostile and -when not arguing with batsmen half his size - accurate. After only six first-class games, he is quickly becoming the find of the tour. But the prospect of a consolation win was taken away from the Academy by a fifth-wicket stand of 155 between the in-form Sridharan Sriram, who made a classy century, and Venugopal Rao, who should have been stumped by Matt Prior off Shaftab Khalid on 31. By the time Kevin Pietersen pulled off a stunning tumbling catch at midwicket, it was all over. \"I wanted the boys to put in a bit more effort,\" said the captain James Tredwell, who had called a team huddle with time running out. \"I just felt we needed a pick-up.\" It is getting to the stage where they need a bit more than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
