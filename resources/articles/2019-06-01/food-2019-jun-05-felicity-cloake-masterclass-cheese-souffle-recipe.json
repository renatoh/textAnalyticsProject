Once you know the science behind the magic, they\u2019re one of the most versatile dishes you can have in your repertoire: quick to make, a treat to eat and guaranteed to impress. Prep 30 min Cook 12 min Serves 6 40g butter, plus extra for greasing 20g fine white breadcrumbs 40g plain flour 300ml whole milk 4 large eggs \u00bd tsp English mustard powder 100g gruy\u00e8re, finely grated 50g parmesan, finely grated Salt and pepper 1 Prepare the moulds Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and boil the kettle. Melt or soften a little of the extra butter and use it thoroughly to coat six small, straight-sided, ovenproof ramekins or similar. Put a spoonful of breadcrumbs in one ramekin, and turn to coat the inside all the way up the sides, holding it over a second ramekin to catch any excess, then repeat and refrigerate. 2 Start the white sauce The souffl\u00e9 base here is a simple white sauce, so melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a moderate heat, then stir in the flour. Keep cooking and stirring for a couple of minutes, until the mixture starts to smell toasty, but don\u2019t let it take on any colour. Gradually whisk in the milk until you have a smooth paste. 3 Finish the sauce, then cool Heat gently, stirring regularly, until the sauce comes to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer, stirring, until it has thickened to a b\u00e9chamel-like consistency, but is still pourable. Tip into a large bowl and set aside to cool slightly; it needs to be hot enough to melt cheese, but not so hot it cooks the egg yolks. 4 Prepare a bain-marie Half-fill a roasting tin with boiling water and put it in the oven \u2013 this bain-marie will insulate the souffl\u00e9 mixture from the intense heat of the oven, and keep the texture soft and custardy, rather than tough and chewy. Separate the eggs, and put the whites in a fresh bowl that\u2019s large enough to accommodate some vigorous whisking. 5 Add cheese, egg yolks and mustard Stir the mustard powder, three-quarters of the grated gruy\u00e8re and all the parmesan into the still-warm white sauce. Season and mix until the cheese has melted into a fairly smooth sauce, then add the egg yolks one by one. Finally, add the rest of the gruy\u00e8re, mixing to distribute it evenly \u2013 don\u2019t worry about it melting this time. 6 Whisk the egg whites Whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff, but not dry or grainy: it\u2019s the air in the whites that expands in the heat of the oven, helping the souffl\u00e9 to rise, so get as much in there as possible, and try not to knock too much out in the next stage. 7 Fold in the egg whites Stir a couple of spoonfuls of the egg whites into the cheese sauce to loosen it, then very slowly and gently fold in the rest of the egg whites with a large metal spoon or spatula. 8 Bake Divide between the ramekins, filling them just shy of the top, then put them in the bain-marie and bake for eight to 12 minutes, until risen and golden, but still wobbly in the centre. Serve immediately. 9 Variations Feel free to substitute cheeses of your choice for the classic gruy\u00e8re and parmesan combo, or stir some finely chopped ham or flaked salmon, sauteed mushrooms, blanched and chopped asparagus, spinach, fresh chives, watercress or spring onions, or a good pinch of smoked paprika into the base, if you like \u2013 just avoid anything too wet. 10 And how to prepare ahead \u2026 Though you\u2019ll get the very best results with freshly beaten egg whites, you can make up to the end of step 5 in advance \u2013 and, to be honest, you\u2019ll still end up with pretty decent souffl\u00e9s if you make it all, cover the filled ramekins and put them in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking. Told you they were easy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
