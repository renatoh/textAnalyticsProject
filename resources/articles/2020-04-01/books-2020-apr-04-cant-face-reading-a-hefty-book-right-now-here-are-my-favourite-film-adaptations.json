Here are my favourite adaptations", "bodyText": "We\u2019ve certainly had some time on our hands, haven\u2019t we? That\u2019s unless you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re home schooling; if so, shout out to you. To pass the time, as well as talking to my plants for several hours, I\u2019ve been watching films. Specifically, films that have been adapted from books. When you start to look into it, there are more of these than you might have realised. This week alone I\u2019ve watched It (Stephen King\u2019s book has been adapted twice, as a TV miniseries in 1990, and as a box office-smashing film in 2017. I can\u2019t choose between the two as both are terrifying and sublime in their own way); Jurassic Park (Michael Crichton wrote such a long novel that the film adaptation is a welcome relief); Holes, both written and adapted by Louis Sachar (so joyful); and 1984 from George Orwell\u2019s novel. Despite it currently being a little too close to home, I\u2019ll always enjoy I Am Legend, which I had zero idea was a novel by Richard Matheson, published in 1954. The winner, though, is the semi-autobiographical City of God (Cidade de Deus) by Paulo Lins. The book is a whopping 496 pages long and right now I can\u2019t do that. My plants are waiting for a chat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
