Dunne towered above Gareth Barry, who was booed throughout against his former club, to head Villa in front in a game that ended 1-1 but the central defender showed no emotion when the ball arced over Shay Given. \"I don't have a celebration \u2013 when I score it's usually a surprise,\" said Dunne, who came close to adding a second before Craig Bellamy equalised. \"I really enjoyed my time at City and I really respect the club and the fans and [not celebrating] seemed the right thing to do. It just seems to happen playing against your former club, people seem to score. [But] I wasn't expecting to score tonight.\" Martin O'Neill described Dunne's performance as \"magnificent\", although the Villa manager admitted that he was oblivious to the defender's muted reaction to the goal until told about it afterwards. \"He was immense,\" said O'Neill. \"There was a determination to play well. Apparently his celebrations went down well because he hardly celebrated at all. I didn't know that because I was too busy celebrating myself. But I'm delighted to have him.\" The warm reception City fans gave Dunne contrasted sharply with the abuse that Barry faced from the home supporters. The England international's every touch was heckled and he was also subjected to chants of \"There's only one greedy bastard\" following his decision to reject a new contract offer at Villa in the summer and join Manchester City. Bellamy, meanwhile, was the real thorn in Villa's side. \"Craig's playing out of his skin at the moment and it doesn't matter where I play him,\" said Mark Hughes, the City manager. \"He can play straight down the middle with a big man, he can play alongside Carlos [Tevez] or out wide. I just think he's playing with confidence now. Irrespective of who he's up against or who's on his team, he wants to be the best player to pull a shirt on and for most of the games this year he has been. \"I think he's used the guys coming into the team as a challenge. He wants the shirt and the shirt is his by rights now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
