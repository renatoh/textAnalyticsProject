Now we get to see five new short plays from Eno about the absurdity of being human. Erica Whyman, who championed Eno's distinctive voice when she was at Notting Hill's Gate Theatre, directs the works in which hope is always in tension with experience, and whose title Oh, The Humanity comes with the afterthought \"and other good intentions\". Events, workshops and performances surrounding the main production celebrate the contrariness of being human and include Quarantine's excellent Entitled and Dan Bye's performance lecture, The Price Of Everything. Northern Stage, to 24 Sep Lyn Gardner Cool Hand Luke, London We're well used by now to films being adapted for the stage, and particularly being turned into musicals (Ghost, Legally Blonde et al). Now a movie that you might not expect has appeared in the West End: Cool Hand Luke, which starred Paul Newman in 1967. This version is based on the original novel by Donn Pearce, and the sometime safecracker's experience in a brutal Florida prison camp. The Luke in question is a second world war veteran who is given to ludicrous feats and bizarre bets \u2013 memorably betting the other inmates that he can eat 50 eggs \u2013 as well as attempts to escape. Marc Warren, last seen in the West End in Little Voice, plays Luke in this tale of the human spirit triumphing over a system that's purposely designed to break men down. Aldwych Theatre, WC2, Fri to 7 Jan Mark Cook Othello, Sheffield The Crucible is celebrating its 40th birthday in style and showing no sign of becoming middle-aged under Daniel Evans, who's doing a terrific job running the Sheffield venue. He's certainly scored a coup in getting two stars of television's The Wire to play opposite each other in the venue's first ever staging of Shakespeare's tragedy of jealousy and betrayal. Clarke Peters plays the successful general, an outsider whose marriage to the beautiful Desdemona sets tongues wagging, and Dominic West is the villainous Iago, who drips poison into Othello's ear. It should be a cracker. Crucible Theatre, to 15 Oct LG Terrible Advice, London The Menier Chocolate Factory near London Bridge has had a quiet time of late but expect things to perk up with this, the world premiere of a play written by a star of the popular US sitcom Frasier. In that show Saul Rubinek played Donny, the lawyer ditched at the altar by Daphne before she finally hooked up with Niles. Terrible Advice, his debut work, deals with similarly complicated romantic entanglements among friends. The cast includes US film and TV star Scott Bakula (Quantum Leap, Star Trek: Enterprise); a British TV stalwart in Caroline Quentin; Sharon Horgan of Pulling fame; and Andy Nyman, one of the stars and co-creators of the hugely successful theatre horror Ghost Stories. They're directed by Muppets man Frank Oz (the voice of Miss Piggy, Fozzy Bear and Animal no less), who's also an accomplished film director (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Stepford Wives). Menier Chocolate Factory, SE1, Thu to 12 Nov MC The Missing, Glasgow Adapted by Andrew O'Hagan from his own book \u2013 a compelling mixture of memoir about his Glasgow childhood and a meditation on the people who go missing almost unnoticed \u2013 this latest production from National Theatre of Scotland is directed by John Tiffany, who also directed the stage version of O'Hagan's novel, Be Near Me. O'Hagan's book is not just about those who get lost, but also the sense of not belonging, the loss of community, and the connections between events in different places. While it's not an obvious book to make the transition from page to stage, the result could be rewarding. Performances are complemented by a video installation by Graham Fagen called Missing which further explores themes in the book. Tramway, to 1 Oct LG Autobiographer, London &amp; Plymouth Melanie Wilson is such a distinctive performer, melding sound and words to spine-tingling effect. Much of her work has played with shifting identity and uncertainty. Now, in an ambitious new piece with a cast of four, Wilson examines memory itself through the eyes and mind of 80-year-old Flora, who is suffering from dementia. Wilson spent six months researching this piece, and the results should display her ability to get inside the heads of both her fictional creations and the audience. The Albany, SE8, Sat; Drum Theatre, Plymouth, Tue to 24 Sep LG The Metamorphosis, London Any stage adaptation of Kafka's Metamorphosis cries out for a dancer to star; making a human body resemble an insect requires suppleness and control. Back in 1989, Mikhail Baryshnikov starred in Steven Berkoff's dramatisation of Kafka's novella. Now Royal Ballet principal Edward Watson appears in a choreographed version of the same work. He should be perfect for the role: lean, leggy, pale and with a talent for portraying crazed characters. Linbury Studio At The Royal Opera House, WC2, Mon to 24 Sep Judith Mackrell Royal Ballet: Jewels, London The Royal starts its new season in sparkling style with a revival of George Balanchine's Jewels. This triptych of three abstract ballets celebrates a trio of contrasting styles. Emeralds is a study in pastoral romanticism, its Faur\u00e9 score inspiring delicate movements. Rubies, set to Stravinsky's Capriccio For Piano And Orchestra, fast forwards to 20th-century America and a stageful of jazzy dancers. Finally, Diamonds, set to Tchaikovsky's Third Symphony, is an evocation of grand classical traditions. This 1967 work is a wonderful showcase, especially for the principals who include Tamara Rojo and Marianela N\u00fa\u00f1ez.
