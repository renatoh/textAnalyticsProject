As a form of political activism, the boycotts are novel, but perhaps the response to them isn\u2019t: they have been described as \u201cdivisive and unproductive\u201d and a barrier to constructive dialogue. Those remarks came from Vic Alhadeff, who was the subject of the first boycott. In his capacity as CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, Alhadeff issued a community update on 9 July which justified Israel\u2019s Operation Protective Edge by republishing a statement from Israel\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs. By doing so, I and others argued, he abrogated his responsibility to remain neutral as chairman of the NSW community relations commission (CRC). We argued his position had become untenable, and that he had to resign. Local Arab leaders issued an open letter to Victor Dominello, the NSW citizenship minister, and met with him in person, but the minister concluded that Alhadeff \u201cis doing an outstanding job\u201d as CRC chair and would remain in the post. Similarly, Mike Baird, the NSW premier, affirmed that Alhadeff had \u201chis full confidence\u201d \u2013 although he conceded that it was inappropriate in his role for him to have made those comments. This was seen as a slap on the hand for Alhadeff, and a slap in the face for NSW\u2019s Muslim leaders. After being ignored, a boycott or withdrawal becomes a worthwhile option. Community leaders announced that they would \u201csuspend involvement with the CRC so long as [Alhadeff] is at the helm \u2026 [because] the minister has walked away from what is morally right\u201d. Many who had accepted the invitation to attend the premier\u2019s annual Iftar (breaking of fast) dinner, scheduled for that week, announced that they would \u201crespectfully withdraw \u2026 on moral grounds\u201d. They could not break bread with those who shrugged off what they saw as propaganda. Images of injured or dead Palestinian children had spoiled their appetite for a celebration. The result was many empty tables at the parliament house dinner. Photos of Baird addressing the half-full room made a powerful statement: the premier and minister did not treat Australian Arabs and Muslims with respect, so they acted with respect for their culture, faith and tradition. The \u201cIftar boycott\u201d is such a strong image because dining is much more than physical act of eating, it\u2019s a spiritual communion of people. There is an Arabic expression said after a meal is shared, along the lines of \u201cthere is now bread and salt between us\u201d. Even the poorest people share what little food they have as a gesture of hospitality, which is often bread and salt. Salt is a bonding and flavouring agent when baking bread, and a bonding agent that preserves friendships. It\u2019s also a common motif in the Abrahamic faiths. In Christianity, breaking bread holds profound significance after the last supper, as does salt; Christians are described as the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d in Matthew\u2019s gospel. In the Jewish Shabbat, there is silence during the hand-washing ritual before the bread is blessed. Refusing to break bread together is neither about dishonouring the host, nor is it a threat or a provocation. It is, rather, a gesture to indicate that he has dishonoured you. The Sydney Morning Herald apprehended this in their editorial on 26 July, when they lamented that \u201csome ill-chosen and insensitive words at an inopportune time have tarnished [Alhadeff\u2019s] otherwise fine work\u201d. Alhadeff resigned the next day and Baird finally conceded that his comments had made his position untenable. \u201cI will always listen to the Muslim community, just as he has in that resignation,\u201d Baird said, proving the boycott was a landmark lesson in how to be heard without yelling; on 28 July he addressed thousands of Muslims at Lakemba mosque. The precedent was repeated last week when the Australian National Imams Council announced its withdrawal from the annual Eid dinner hosted by the Australian Federal Police on 7 August. Again, it was a moral stand led by professor Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, the Grand Mufti, who said they \u201cregrettably, must in all good conscience decline the invitation to attend the dinner in protest of the new proposed anti-terrorism laws \u2026 the amendments are a direct attack on the \u2026 presumption of innocence\u201d. Like the Alhadeff boycott, which was launched to preserve the CRC\u2019s neutrality, the AFP boycott sought to preserve a fundamental maxim of Australia\u2019s system of justice, the presumption of innocence. Neither promoted, imported or apologised for an ideology that is dangerous or divisive, such as fighting foreign wars. Yet both boycotts were met by last-minute offers that miscalculated the seriousness of the Muslim community\u2019s concerns: Alhadeff issued a statement, rather than an apology, and the AFP invited the Grand Mufti to speak about his concerns. Many Muslim Australians watched with horror as their American counterparts were humiliated at Barack Obama\u2019s annual Iftar dinner at the White House on 14 July, when he appeared with Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer. With Dermer\u2019s tweeted support, Obama said during the dinner that \u201cIsrael has the right to defend itself against \u2026 inexcusable attacks from Hamas.\u201d He was talking at them, not to them. Any hope that the dinner was a dialogue were smashed when the president left soon after his speech. Given the US weapons supplied to kill civilians in Gaza, many argued that the dinner should have been boycotted in the first place. The American-Arab anti-discrimination committee made the case: \u201cpolitical engagement is important and having a seat at the table is crucial \u2014 but only when that seat is intended to amplify our voice as a community, not tokenise or subdue it.\u201d A third Australian boycott has been announced, over the controversial resignation of Fairfax columnist Mike Carlton. Peak Muslim organisations have written to Fairfax, calling for Carlton to be reinstated or they may stop cooperating with journalists and start targeting advertisers. Given that the Australian Jewish News had called for readers to \u201ccancel your Fairfax subscriptions\u201d a week earlier, this counter-boycott risks being trivialised; there was less at stake. It may have been wiser for community leaders to invite the editors to their table, break bread together, and explain why Carlton was a vital voice for the voiceless. The political Iftar has arisen during a period of conflict and tragedy, but it may well become a new phenomenon in Australia. If Australians are serious about multiculturalism, the broader community should realise that the boycotts are a pouring forth of Ramadan themes of human rights, justice, integrity, poverty and morality, which return each year. The 2015 Iftar agenda could be political again; consulting with and respecting Australian Muslims may ensure next year\u2019s hosts won\u2019t need to guess who\u2019s not coming to dinner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
