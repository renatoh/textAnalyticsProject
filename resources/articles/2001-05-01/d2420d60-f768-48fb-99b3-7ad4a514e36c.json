The education secretary, preparing to take over as home secretary in a post-election reshuffle, is expected to be handed control of anti-drugs policies as part of his new brief. Labour's manifesto promises to make combatting drugs a priority, including the creation of an agency to seize the assets of traffickers, a sex offenders-style register of dealers and \u00a3200m to fund neighbourhood partnerships. The Cabinet Office under Mo Mowlam has been in charge of the brief which also involved the Home Office, but Tony Blair and his advisers believe the Home Office should take the lead. One cabinet minister involved in the discussions said: \"You cannot operate against organised international criminals without a department like the Home Office controlling the policy.\" The deputy prime minister John Prescott, widely tipped to succeed Ms Mowlam who is standing down at the election, is said to be \"relaxed\" about the switch. Labour's manifesto asserts that \"one of the biggest contemporary drivers of crime is drugs\" and Mr Blunkett is thought to regard it as a crucial law and order issue. The minister, who has retained deep roots in Sheffield, was described by one ally as \"aggressively working class\" about drugs and deeply hostile towards dealers. Moving the central co-ordination of drugs policy to the Home Office would be resisted, however, by drugs tsar Keith Hellawell and would dismay many working in the drug treatment and education field. The switch would be seen as a decision which gave a renewed emphasis to the law enforcement policies of the Home Office over and above education, treatment and rehabilitiation programmes - though the Labour manifesto also pledges to raise spending on drug treatment by 70% by 2004. Mr Hellawell has already successfully resisted one Whitehall attempt to dislodge him as the drugs tsar but he only managed to stay in the job after a personal appeal to Tony Blair himself. His deputy, Mike Trace, who came from a drug treatment charity, is widely regarded as a success and is thought to be particularly highly rated by Mr Blunkett. Mr Blair is under pressure from advisers to set time aside during the campaign to decide the shape of departments and who will run them. He did not decide cabinet posts in 1997 until polling day itself, sitting in his Sedgefield garden on May 1 with chief of staff Jonathan Powell and press secretary Alastair Campbell to finalise appointments. Decisions are unlikely to be reached much earlier this time round, but an aide said the premier wanted to go beyond \"musical chairs\" around the cabinet table. A \"working age\" ministry may be carved out of the education and employment department, ironically one of the few departments considered to have met its objectives. Mr Prescott is fighting to take regional policy to the Cabinet Office in place of drugs. Downing Street has recently pointedly been pushing Mr Blunkett as a counterweight to Gordon Brown, who, No 10 officials believe, is too powerful at the Treasury. Challenged at Labour's manifesto launch why the document had seven pictures of him and none of his colleagues, Mr Blair praised just two of his cabinet by name: Mr Brown and Mr Blunkett. Allies of Mr Blunkett say he favours a \"collegiate\" style of government and has none of Mr Brown's ambition to one day win the Labour crown, admitting in an interview this year that he did not think Britain was ready for a blind premier. Yet they also point out that Mr Blunkett believes speculation over feuding between Mr Blair and Mr Brown will not die down without the existence of more prominent cabinet members to \"stop it looking like a two-man show\". The favourite to be the next home secretary is, after Messrs Blair and Brown, the third most popular cabinet minster, according to opinion polls.
