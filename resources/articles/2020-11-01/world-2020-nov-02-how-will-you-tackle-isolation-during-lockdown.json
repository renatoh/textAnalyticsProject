We\u2019d like to speak to people who live in England about any concerns they may have about isolation under a second lockdown, and how they plan to manage it. We\u2019d also like to hear from people in Wales about how they have coped with isolation during the country\u2019s firebreaker lockdown, and those in Scotland and Northern Ireland who are unable to meet other households indoors.
