It was one of the four buttons on his Space Command 400, the first commercially viable TV remote control. The other three buttons \u2013 on/off, channel up and channel down \u2013 might have seemed more vital, but Adler\u2019s boss, Eugene F McDonald, a former naval intelligence officer who was nicknamed \u201cThe Commander\u201d, had insisted on mute. \u201cHe hated commercials,\u201d Adler recalled in 1987. McDonald feared these constant intrusions would kill the new medium of TV. So Zenith boasted that the mute button would allow viewers to \u201cshut off the sound of long, annoying commercials\u201d. Still, McDonald couldn\u2019t have predicted the pop-up ad, petrol pumps trying to sell you nachos or the ravages of the distraction economy. It is only now, in an age of incessant interruption, that we are beginning to grasp muting\u2019s full potential \u2013 not only when it comes to our gadgets, but in real life, too. Last month, the taxi company Uber began trialling a suite of new features for users of its Exec service \u2013 including a button you can activate if you want to mute your driver. \u201cQuiet preferred\u201d is the euphemism Uber is using (you can also toggle it to \u201chappy to chat\u201d \u2013 lucky driver). But it appears to bring the dream of being able to choose who and what we listen to a step closer. \u201cFrom a driver\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s quite rude,\u201d an Uber driver from east London tells me. \u201cAnd offensive, to be honest. It\u2019s like saying: \u2018Shut up.\u2019 It says a lot about Uber.\u201d Uber claims it is responding to concerns from customers that drivers will give them low star ratings if they don\u2019t want to chat; drivers meanwhile often fear entering into conversations with passengers for the same reason. But let\u2019s be honest: who among us hasn\u2019t fantasised about being able to mute an annoying colleague, a screaming toddler or an over-friendly waiter? Mute promises a snake-free garden, a world where you can curate your content and silence dissent. And it is proving irresistible online. Twitter introduced a mute function in 2014 and it has proved to be the social network\u2019s most popular feature, a sort of automatic talk-to-the-hand. Instead of \u201cblocking\u201d someone objectionable (which they will know about) you can now discreetly \u201cmute\u201d them (which they won\u2019t know about). Part of the appeal is the thought of trolls screaming and @-ing and wondering why you\u2019re not replying. Twitter followed it up with a subject-based mute feature in 2017: so, if you don\u2019t want to hear about Love Island, or Terfs, or the Champions League final, or Dominic Raab, for ever if need be, you don\u2019t have to. If you want a glimpse of happy Twitter, type \u201cmute button\u201d into the search box: \u201cJust wanna thank my \u2018mute\u2019 button for never giving up on me &lt;3\u201d; \u201cMute button is top 10 most powerful things in the universe\u201d; \u201cI thank @instagram for creating their mute posts and story buttons\u201d etc. Instagram added its own mute function last year, inspired by what it called \u201ccomplex social dynamics\u201d. Now you can avoid your friend\u2019s nauseating Ibiza selfies and tasting menu stories without fear of causing offence. \u201cI\u2019m happy for my friends who are achieving great things, but Instagram makes it too easy to start getting bitter about why that\u2019s not me,\u201d one muter explained. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to living in a self-imposed creative bubble for a little while.\u201d The clinical psychologist Paul Gilbert, author of Living Like Crazy, sees such responses in Jungian terms. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming more persona-dominated,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all put on an act about how people want to see and hear us. We do it all the time on social media.\u201d For him, the Uber shush feature is a welcome chance for us to rest those personas for a few minutes. \u201cHuman beings evolved in small hunter-gatherer groups where everyone knew one another,\u201d he says. \u201cWe aren\u2019t necessarily adapted to be interacting with strangers all the time. People find it incredibly tiring. At least in a taxi, you have an opportunity to sit and be quiet.\u201d Well, yes, that is true. But what I find disturbing about the Uber silence feature is precisely that it cuts off any possibility of human connection. It is a way of automating a function that we might once have negotiated in human language. The Uber driver points out that it\u2019s not hard for him to gauge who might be up for a chat and who isn\u2019t. \u201cYou say: \u2018What\u2019s your name? Where are you going?\u2019 And the way they respond is a fairly clear indication of whether they want to talk or not. Most people have their earphones on anyway. I usually have my Bluetooth earphone in too.\u201d A lot of the time, he is plugged into Telegram, the Russian-designed messaging app that functions a bit like an aural WhatsApp. \u201cThere are groups with about 200 drivers on Telegram \u2013 they\u2019ll report what\u2019s happening in real time. If you see an accident, you can report it to the group.\u201d Otherwise, it\u2019s \u201caudiobooks, lectures, radio, podcasts, educational stuff. If I want to know something about anything, I\u2019ll download it when I\u2019m home and listen to that.\u201d But you could see that this retreat into our own discrete sound worlds is its own form of muting. Looking around the office in which I am typing these words, at least half of my co-workers are wearing earphones or headphones, and the younger they are, the more likely they are to be plugged in \u2013 or out. The wider trend is known as the \u201cprivatisation of auditory space\u201d, says Dr Tom Rice, a lecturer in sonic anthropology at Exeter University. \u201cIt\u2019s often said in sound studies that we don\u2019t have earlids. We don\u2019t have any control over what drips into our ears and collects in them. Earphones are the closest we have to that.\u201d It is generally accepted that our audio environment is becoming more cluttered \u2013 even at home, since our microwaves and washing machines are now more likely to bleep at us (and, in some cases, talk to us). But most people do not mute the world because they find it overwhelming or confusing. \u201cIt\u2019s also that they consider it boring,\u201d says Rice. \u201cPeople will often think that the sounds that they\u2019re exposed to aren\u2019t worth listening to.\u201d The dawn chorus, after all, is famously not what it was, and general human patter is being drowned out by pneumatic drills, lorries and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Galway Girl blasting out of the supermarket public address system. \u201cWhen we conduct surveys about modern life and ask people what the biggest irritants of modern life are, \u2018unwanted music or sound\u2019 is usually in the top five,\u201d says Dr Daniel Levitin, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal and author of The Organised Mind. This has a lot to do with the way our hearing system works. \u201cCompare it with vision. When you look at an object, it appears to be out there in the world. But sounds, for most of us, feel like they\u2019re emanating from within our heads. It makes them more intimate and more intrusive. \u201cIn the best case, you can say headphones are a way to gain control of your environment,\u201d he adds. It was striking, when Spotify users shared their most-played songs at the end of 2019, how many of the titles included \u201cwaves\u201d or \u201crain noise\u201d, suggesting that many listeners simply wanted to block distractions. \u201cBut the worst case,\u201d Levitin says, \u201cis that young people are listening to music and thinking that they can increase their concentration and performance that way. There are thousands of studies that show that listening to music is incredibly bad for your concentration. It\u2019s just more enjoyable.\u201d Meanwhile, our capacity to tune out whatever we want is increasingly catching up with our desire to do just that. \u201cHearables\u201d are now touted the new \u201cwearables\u201d in Silicon Valley. Amazon, Apple and Google are all working on in-ear technology. The start-up Doppler Labs has developed products that promise to cancel out background noise, amplify the voices of particular speakers and even provide live, real-time, Babel fish-like translation. We often imagine a virtual-reality future will involve some sort of interface over our eyes, but it might just as easily work through our ears. Soon we might literally be able to mute people we don\u2019t want to hear. But who knows what else will be silenced? \u201cThe argument is that this is damaging to the quality of public space and to the social fabric \u2013 we all just become atomised individuals,\u201d says Rice. If we are listening to podcasts or music or white noise all the time, we are removing ourselves from society and the chance to interact, help, experience delight. \u201cI personally don\u2019t have much against earphones and I think they can be fantastically useful and enriching of one\u2019s auditory life,\u201d says Rice. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s possible to get value out of your sound environment by paying attention to it.\u201d One way is by focusing on your sound diet. \u201cCan you isolate five sounds in your everyday environment that you value and enjoy and that enrich your life? The way the sink at work gurgles when you turn off the tap, a fragment of birdsong, wind in the trees, footsteps echoing under a bridge \u2026 As well as drawing our attention to specific sounds, an exercise such as this encourages us to think about our sound environment more generally, and about which sounds we want more \u2013 and less \u2013 of in our lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
