A Colin Nish strike in the first 25 seconds gave them the perfect start in the first home game of the season. Nish showed great composure to beat his marker and slot the ball past keeper Robert Olejnik at his near post. The striker then missed a gilt edged to chance to increase the lead, when set up by Steven Fletcher, before doubling the lead on 25-minutes with a header at the back post from a flick-on by Fletcher. Bairns striker Michael Higdon went some way to making up for his penalty miss against Rangers last week by pulling a goal back for the visitors five minutes later. However, the home side started the second half in similar fashion to the first half with an early goal from a ball played to the back post by Dean Shiels knocked back by Nish for Paul Hanlon to finish. Higdon again narrowed the margin seven minutes later. Fletcher hit the crossbar as the home side attempted to further their lead and Mark Stewart shot against the post in the last minute of the match as Hibs hung on to collect their first win of the season. St Mirren striker Jim Hamilton and Kilmarnock midfielder Mehdi Taouil hit the crossbar in an otherwise drab 0-0 clash at Love Street. It took until the 53rd minute for there to be much action of note, Hamilton climbed high at the back post to meet a Jack Ross cross but powered his close-range header off the woodwork. With six minutes remaining, Saints keeper Mark Howard, who had made a fine save from a close-range header from Conor Sammon, punched clear a Garry Hay free-kick only to see Taouil's return volley crash off the bar. In the closing seconds, Killie's Alan Combe made a decent save from Stephen O'Donnell but neither side showed enough desire to collect three points. Hamilton Accies beat Inverness Caley 1-0 as the SPL's top two teams met at the Caledonian stadium. In a scrappy opening period short on creativity, Inverness had the first chance of the game when Dougie Imrie's cross fell eventually to Roy McBain, but his volley was well saved by Tomas Cerny. Accies started to ask questions of the defence soon after when a searching ball from Anthony Stevenson found Richard Offiong, but his effort was blocked by Phil McGuire. Andrew Barrowman was released by Ian Black after 12 minutes, but Cerny rushed out to clear the danger, with referee Stevie O'Reilly waving away the forward's appeals that the Hamilton keeper had handled outside the box. It was up to Accies top goal scorer last season, Offiong, to break the deadlock with the last attack of the first half. The striker beat debutant defender Jamie Duff before placing the ball past Michael Fraser in the home goal. Adam Rooney came on at half-time for Russell Duncan while Imrie and Don Cowie switched flanks as Craig Brewster looked to get Inverness back on level terms. The hosts should have levelled when Cowie found himself with time and space in the Hamilton box but his woeful effort was easily cleared by the defence. A late free-kick winner from Charlie Mulgrew gave Aberdeen their first victory of the season as they defeated Motherwell 1-0 at Fir Park. Motherwell enjoyed more of the play and picked up the pace after the interval with Scott Severin making a crucial tackle when Chris Porter pulled the ball back for David Clarkson inside the box.The hosts then twice came close from Hammell corners. The first headed just over by Stephen Hughes and the second seeing Jamie Langfield push away a powerful Paul Quinn header on his goal line. Mark McGhee's side were made to pay when a superb 25 yard free kick by Mulgrew won the game for the visitors with four minutes remaining."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
