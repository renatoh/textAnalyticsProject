However, I wonder how Mr Hastings looks back on his stewardship of Johnson when he was editor of the Telegraph and BJ was Brussels correspondent writing his \u201cflamboyant\u201d, going-on-lying stories from Brussels (remember the EU standardised condoms?) which set the mood of sneering contempt for the EU that David Cameron shortsightedly encouraged and that ultimately led to the mess we\u2019re in now. The man himself told Desert Island Discs in 2005, as quoted in Andrew Gimson\u2019s Boris biography: \u201c\u2026everything I wrote from Brussels I found was sort of chucking these rocks over the garden wall and I listened to this amazing crash from the greenhouse next door over in England as everything I wrote from Brussels was having this amazing, explosive effect on the Tory party, and it really gave me this I suppose rather weird sense of power.\u201d Sends shivers down the backbone, huh? After his spell in Brussels, Johnson was promoted. Helen Oldfield Deddington, Oxfordshire \u2022 In her 1931 book Women and Politics, the Unionist party MP Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, advised voters to ask themselves three questions: \u201cIs the policy for which a candidate stands in the interests of the country as a whole; is it an honourable and a practicable policy; and is his or her personal and intellectual equipment such that he or she can be trusted to further it in an honest and intelligent manner?\u201d Surely something to worry about for those considering Boris Johnson for the next leader/PM? A far-sighted and committed anti-fascist, she was nicknamed \u201cthe red duchess\u201d for her concern for those caught up in the Spanish civil war. She was always, however, a true-blue Tory. Jane M Card Harwell Village, Oxfordshire \u2022 What planet has Matthew d\u2019Ancona been on since the 1980s (Boris Johnson has turned the Tory party into a cult, 24 June)? The Tories have been a faith-based party ever since Margaret Thatcher took over. Their bizarre membership currently prepared to risk the breakup of the UK, and even the fate of their own party, for the sake of a no-deal Brexit are very much Thatcher\u2019s progeny and \u201ctrue\u201d believers in English exceptionalism. They have a surreal nostalgia for an unreal imperial Britain before the virus of socialism was introduced and total faith in all the neoliberal nonsense that Britain has been subjected to since 1979. D\u2019Ancona once characterised Michael Gove as a visionary-reforming liberal just after he had, at massive expense, fragmented and further marketised schooling to its current detriment \u2013 insane meddling with generations of children\u2019s wellbeing on the basis of evidence-free faith in the primacy of markets and total contempt for the knowledge and expertise of educationalists. Liz Truss, on radio recently, speaks with the same evidence-free certainty about the opportunities of a hard Brexit and the Thatcherite paradise that will be delivered post-Brexit. Philip Wood Kidlington, Oxfordshire \u2022 As you state (The public won\u2019t choose the next prime minister. But scrutiny is still vital, 24 June), Johnson\u2019s \u201crecord in office is one of carelessness\u201d, not only with public money and the fate of British subjects, but also \u201cabout the truth\u201d. In the list of his \u201chorrible rhetoric\u201d, Matthew d\u2019Ancona should not have omitted this \u201cpotential\u201d prime minister\u2019s description of the \u00a3250,000 paid for his weekly Telegraph column as \u201cchicken feed\u201d, as it is clearly indicative of his total lack of empathy; if there exists a Labour propaganda machine, Johnson\u2019s mouth has to be a godsend. d\u2019Ancona correctly concludes that \u201cwe have a right to know everything\u201d about this would-be PM, and that must, therefore, include whether he is as careless with his own finances as he appears to be with the public\u2019s. Pressure needs to be exerted to persuade the two remaining candidates to make public their recent tax records. It seems ridiculous that voters know more about the tax paid by the likes of Amazon than paid by our prime minister! Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 On my 22nd birthday in 1972 we went to the Trout Inn near Oxford for a candlelit dinner. When we arrived we found the dining room trashed. The barman apologised: \u201cWe had the Bullingdon Club in last night.\u201d We were mystified: \u201cDid you call the police?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWho will pay for all the damage?\u201d He sighed: \u201cTheir dads will be here on Monday morning with their chequebooks.\u201d And now they\u2019re trashing the country.
