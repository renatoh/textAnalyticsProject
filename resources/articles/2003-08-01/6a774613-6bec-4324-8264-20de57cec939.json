The Irish hooker has enjoyed his first taste of competitive rugby in 11 months, after a period of convalescence from two shoulder operations that has coincided with the kind of turbulence few 31-year-olds could relate to. Beside the sudden death of his brother, at 42, followed two days later by the birth of his son and then the death of his mother, a career-threatening right shoulder injury is viewed in a more appropriate perspective. \"The grief is still there but now I'm ready to play,\" he said, in a break from preparations for this autumn's World Cup which, he hopes, will represent both the pinnacle and the end of his outstanding career, lending it a sharper definition. \"But I've found it an unbelievably difficult time. The confusion of emotions, with Gordon dying on Thursday - almost a year ago now - and Alexander being born on the Saturday, meant I had to strike some level of global balance. It was very, very hard. And I'd just got round to playing again when my mother passed away three months later. \"But I think the Irish, often with large families, handle grief well. There was no need for counselling or anything like that. We've always been a close family and all this pulled us even closer together.\" Wood spent the months that followed at his home in Killaloe, in Clare, a county in the west of Ireland renowned for its bleak beauty and haunted history. \"It has changed me. I'm no longer prepared to let things drift by. I don't want to live life by the seat of my pants. But I do want to live it to the absolute full.\" There is a history of heart disease in the Wood family. His father, Gordon senior, who played 29 times for Ireland and toured with the Lions to Australasia and Canada in 1959, died in 1982 in his early 50s. Wood was training at Limerick University last September when he heard of his brother Gordon's massive heart attack. \"I suppose he was high-risk. He never really looked after himself. He was a smoker. And he had a freak heart attack a few years ago which damaged his heart. We were very close. My mother, Pauline, had had a couple of heart attacks over the previous three or four years. She had a stroke six months before she died. But it was a great six months. She was more tired than debilitated in that time. \"I was fortunate that I was injured at this time. I was able to get my head round the concept of grief. And I needed to grieve, fully. And my little boy was fantastic.\" Wood missed the funeral of his brother to be with his wife, Nicola, for the birth of their son. The life of a professional sportsman is like a condensed version of real life, its growth, peak and decline all squeezed into a few precious years; off the pitch, too, Wood must feel that his recent time has been compressed, as if he has been indulging Michael Aspel and his famous red book. Now it is not only the World Cup but his entire future that fills his mind. \"I won't get into coaching when I've finished. I don't have the temperament for it. I'm a very cranky man. When you're captain you can exhort further levels of dedication from the other players because you're doing the same thing yourself. You're driving yourself to the same level. But the crossover to coaching is not something I'd feel comfortable with, the idea of demanding an awful lot from people which I'm not demanding from myself is just not something I want to do. It doesn't interest me. \"I'll step away from the game for a couple of years. But rugby has been too big a part of my life for me not to give something back. I'll do something with kids, in time. I've been involved with summer camps and really enjoyed the experience. In the meantime I will get more involved with my PR company, Touch Wood, and other business ventures.\" To describe himself as cranky might be taking self-deprecation a little far. But he proved himself capable of stubborn self-assertion four years ago when, alone, he confronted the Irish RFU over image rights. And he refused to back down under pressure. His current relationship with his bosses is more friendly. \"I don't really regret what I did, though I might do things differently and more quietly these days. In that respect I suppose I've mellowed a bit. Time changes everyone and it's certainly changed me recently. I'm still up for an argument if one is necessary. But we have an excellent management structure, we really do. \"Playing for Ireland has driven me all these years. I feel I've given an awful lot to Harlequins and Munster and thoroughly enjoyed both careers. My seven or so years with Quins were terrific. I liked the idea of this mad Irishman playing for the most English of clubs. I don't think I let the club down but I'd like to have left on a higher note, instead of limping out with an injury. \"But playing for your country is the be-all and end-all. And the premier competition, held only every four years, is the World Cup. And every World Cup has been significantly bigger than the previous one. This is the biggest tournament of my career and I feel I can play the best rugby of my life over the next few months. I think we've got a pretty good chance. I don't want to go totally over the top and say we will win it but at the same time I don't want to disparage our hopes. \"I do think there is a real possibility that we will win the World Cup - a possibility, not a probability. We haven't won anything for a long period of time. We have a number of good players, although we're always looking for more strength in depth.\" Wood made a non-playing return to the Ireland squad during their tour of the southern hemisphere. \"I got a real kick from being back and involved, even though I wasn't playing. The balance of power is still very much with the southern hemisphere countries. But England are on fire at the moment and really do have a good chance.\" Ireland without Wood in the World Cup would remind some people of the country's football team without Roy Keane last summer. \"It's more match fitness I lack then anything else. But that applies to a lot of us at the moment. I played 70 minutes in my comeback match against Wales on Saturday week and another 50 on Friday night. My shoulder will give me trouble until the end. But thanks to my surgeon, Phil Bailey in London, it should stand up in the World Cup. If it does, Phil should take just as much credit as me.\" Wood first damaged his shoulder while winning the sixth of his 52 Ireland caps, against Japan, in 1995 and was out of the game for a lengthy period. Injury also ruled him out of most of the 2002 Six Nations as well as all the matches this year. He has recently been working on his fitness at the gym he has had installed in one of his spare bedrooms. He has also been working with the facilities at Limerick University. Ireland's fitness coach, Mike McGurn, has been spending two days a week with him and Fergie O'Callaghan, Munster's fitness expert, has also been involved. \"There were some big hits in the scrums and I got clobbered a few times around the field in my first comeback game. There is a big step-up from training to playing and I will have to catch up quickly. I managed a try in my second game but a few of us were struggling. I heard a voice beside me say 'Jesus, I'm knackered'.\" Although he came off before the end of both, this is something he does not like doing in serious matches. \"It's a bit of a soapbox thing with me but I don't believe in replacements. I think it detracts from the sport. You battle the whole of a game to wear down the opposition front row and, when you feel you've won, the opposition bring on three fresh front-row players. I think it's unfair.\" There will be times in the months ahead when Ireland will wish they could bring on three fresh Keith Woods. The bald-as-a-coot hooker's bullocking runs have been one of the great sights of Ireland and Lions rugby in recent years; he scored four tries against the United States in the last World Cup. For Wood, though, the tournament represents more than just rugby. Playing, once again, on the world stage, will help him further come to terms with the most bitter-sweet year of his life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
