Now, after 25 years, G\u00f6ran J\u00e4rvefelt's production and Michael Yeargan's beautifully conceived design is getting its final outing. J\u00e4rvefelt's triumph lies in the finely judged contrasts he sets up: the work's vibrant characters stand out against the drab deprivation of their bohemian quarter, just as their idealism and artistic aspirations are set against their desperate circumstances. Director Caroline Chaney simply sharpens things here and there: fire-irons instead of baguettes add edge to the mock duel, while the presence of a photographer, lying in wait, adds an air of seediness to the scene in Cafe Momus where Musetta hoists her skirt high. Yet success on the night has depended on the quality of the singing: having three Welsh singers of the calibre of Rebecca Evans as Mimi, Gwyn Hughes Jones as Rodolfo and Jason Howard as Marcello was a treat. Evans's grip on Mimi's emotional nature was secure, while Hughes Jones managed to suggest something of the poet's existential dilemma, as well as an affecting tenderness of tone. Since moving into Wagner, Howard's burnished baritone is a good deal weightier than when he first sang on this set in 1993, but he still pulls it off with panache. In the pit, Andrew Greenwood maintained tight ensemble work; if only he could have curbed the bursts of premature applause. \u2022 At WMC, Cardiff (0870 40 2000) 20 May, 3, 5 and 6 June \u2022 Birmingham Hippodrome ( 0844 338 5000) 28 and 30 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
