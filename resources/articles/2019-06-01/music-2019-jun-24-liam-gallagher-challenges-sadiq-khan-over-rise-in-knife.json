The former Oasis singer, 46, said: \u201cEvery time you wake up in the morning, there\u2019s some 16-year-old kid been knifed to death. I\u2019ve got kids that age, out and about and that, doing their thing, living, being young. That freaks me right out \u2013 it does worry me. I\u2019ve got teenagers.\u201d Gallagher, who lives in north London, has four children, including his sons Gene, 17, and Lennon, 19. He also has two daughters \u2013 Molly, 22, and six-year-old Gemma. He singled out Khan for apparent inaction in the knife-crime crisis on BBC Breakfast on Monday. He said: \u201cI\u2019d have a word with that mayor \u2013 he seems to not be doing a good job, all them kids getting knifed and all that. The only thing that ever comes out of his mouth is, \u2018London is open.\u2019 What, open for knife crime and dying and stuff?\u201d The killings last weekend of four people within four days in London put knife crime in the capital in the international spotlight, with Donald Trump also criticising Khan over his handling of the issue. Gallagher, who last week claimed he would make a good prime minister because he has previously \u201cdabbled in drugs\u201d, also condemned politicians who use drugs. \u201cI don\u2019t hang out with politicians and I don\u2019t hang out with celebrities that hang out with politicians or these fake rock\u2019n\u2019roll stars that hang out with politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hang out with me and my missus and my kids, and my mates. But if I did see a politician taking drugs, man, he\u2019d get a crack round the head.\u201d He added: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be \u2026 they\u2019re meant to be running the country, aren\u2019t they?\u201d During the Conservative leadership race, the former candidate Rory Stewart admitted to having once taken opium, while Michael Gove admitted to taking cocaine more than 20 years ago. A spokesperson for Khan said: \u201cTackling violent crime is the mayor\u2019s highest priority. He has invested record amounts in the Met, including funding the violent crime taskforce of nearly 300 officers dedicated to tackling violence. \u201cHowever, he can\u2019t fill the huge hole left by devastating Government cuts to the police, youth clubs and other vital public services. \u201cCuts have consequences - as even the Home Secretary has acknowledged, and the government needs to step up and reverse them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
