Immigration officials will register and fingerprint all nationals of five Islamic countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria - before granting entry to the US. The fingerprints will be checked against databases of known terrorists and criminals. Other foreign nationals, including British travellers, are subject to the same controls at the discretion of immigration officers. It is feared that immigration officials will target Muslims in particular. Announcing the new entry regulations in August, the attorney general, John Ashcroft said: \"The vulnerabilities of our immigration system became starkly clear on September 11. This system will expand substantially America's scrutiny of those foreign visitors who may present an elevated national security risk. And it will provide a vital line of defence in the war against terrorism.\" The US embassy in Malaysia yesterday issued the following advisory to those planning trips: \"Along with citizens of many other countries, some Malaysian citizens are likely to encounter these new procedures upon their arrival in the US. The decision of which individuals will be asked to register will be based on information about the current threat of terrorism.\" It is understood that the US embassy in London has not issued similar instructions to British citizens qualifying for visa waivers to travel to the US but has notified visa applicants of the process. The prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, responded angrily today to the warning sent out to his country's citizens. He told reporters: \"There is already a general anti-Muslim hysteria. Because of the acts of a few people the whole Muslim world seems to have been labelled. Of course I'm upset. I am not a thief, I am not a terrorist.\" A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, Inayat Bunglawala, said the policy had caused deep concern that the US appeared to be adopting policies that discriminate against Muslims. \"This makes no distinction between criminals and the wider Muslim community,\" he said. \"The whole point of the war on terror is to preserve our civil liberties, not reduce them.\" The programme went into effect in some airports on September 11, but has now been expanded across the country. Known as the national security entry-exit registration system, it also requires \"high risk aliens\" to check in with authorities periodically to confirm their whereabouts and their continued business in the US. These foreign visitors must also inform US immigration authorities when they leave the country. The US department of justice said that a pilot project using the same fingerprint technology to identify wanted criminals attempting to re-enter the US had resulted in an average of 70 fingerprint \"hits\" each week. Between January and June 2002, the department said 2,000 wanted felons had been arrested. Mr Bunglawala said that many Muslims may think twice before booking a holiday to the US, but said his organisation hoped the \"American government will see sense. There are 1.2 billion [Muslims] around the world. It's not particularly good public relations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
