This goes double in the case of significant others, treble if you co-habit. Beware, though: the two obvious routes of chocolates (share-able) and kinky underwear (well, you know... ) are a little obvious, and frankly a bit naff. Instead, let barely disguised self-interest be your guide. Such considerations led me to a subscription to hip US DIY mag Ready Made (\u00a324) for my girlfriend. Now, you may snicker, but this is to Changing Rooms what The Tube was to Des O'Connor Tonight. Only in magazine form, obviously. And when someone over here cottons on to what these style-conscious Yanks can do with some Tupperware and a common-or-garden For Sale sign, eyebrows will be raised. Oh yes. This is Gemma T Cat's first Christmas in London, and since she has already threatened to do a disappearing act on two separate occasions, I'm keen to do anything to persuade her to stick around for a second one. Covering the house in catnip spray (from toppetshop.co.uk) seems a small price to pay (under a fiver, in fact), and it promises to \"bring out the inner kitten in her\". Awww. Never mind the damaging effects on a child's stable upbringing, the most grievous consequence of divorce (and subsequent re-marriage) is the increased gift burden for the progeny. Luckily, I have negotiated a mutual abstention from gift-duty with my like-minded stepdad. Simba the alsatian has proven less compliant, though. Still, my budget should cope with a package of traditional British sausages ordered from sausagesbypost.co.uk (\u00a312.81). When mums say \"don't worry about me\" on the subject of their Christmas wish list, only a fool would take them for their word. Everyone knows a little sonly or daughterly love can go a long way. In fact, I am entrusting the delivery of said love to some trained hands, courtesy of a one-day membership of The Sanctuary (\u00a360), a women-only health spa and general centre of indulgence in London's Covent Garden. It will also give my mum the excuse to come and visit her son in the Smoke for once instead of dragging me up to Nottinghamshire. When he was a boy, my dad never had a dog. Although he has since owned some quality mutts, there is, I sense, a lot of ground to make up, though this suspicion may be a tenuous justification for my choice of gift. Sponsoring Khara the lioness at Twycross Zoo should do the trick. Luckily, it will also suit step-mum, a big big cat fan. Of course, to sponsor a whole half tonne of Indian lion would prove beyond my budgetry restrictions, but \u00a330 should get them Khara's tail, as well as all the usual visitation rights. Buying gifts for tweenies can be either a piece of cake or an act of faith. You can play safe and opt for their latest fad. Or you can go out on a limb. I am plumping for the latter by buying my eight-year old sister an actionsampler camera from the Lomo people (\u00a325). One shot gives you a series of four photos on one print, giving the impression of movement. All very technical, but pretty cool when it works. Ideal if you own a swift pet. Or if your mum and dad own a stake in, say, a large carnivorous animal.
