Tents are going out of fashion with big companies such as Eurocamp reducing their number and smaller ones like Carisma ditching them altogether. \"Our guests like the idea of being on a campsite but now want luxury accommodation with ensuite facilities,\" says Carisma director Martin Turner. Mobile homes are becoming increasingly like our own homes with pitched roofs and all the mod cons such as fridge freezers, full-sized showers and contemporary furnishings. However, there are a small but growing number of people who want to get back to basics. Witness small campsites such as Cornish Tipi Holidays, which has added new tents this year, and the growing number of safari operators offering luxury tented camps. Here's what's new in the world of camping. New sites Take a day trip to Prague from the Motel Camping Konopiste at Benesov, one of two new Czech Republic sites introduced by Vacansoleil (08700 778779, vacansoleil.co.uk). Situated on the edge of a forest and nature area, the site has a swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, tennis courts, table tennis, mini-golf, playground and restaurant. Seven nights in a fully equipped tent for six costs \u00a3278 at the beginning of June or \u00a3314 at the end of August, including Dover-Calais ferry crossings. Canvas Holidays (01383 629000, canvasholidays.co.uk) has added Camping Belle Italia at Lake Garda. The site has direct access to a lakeside beach, five pools and watersport facilities. A 12-night holiday between April 16 and May 6 costs \u00a3431 for a family of two adults and up to four children including short sea ferry crossings and accommodation in an air-conditioned Festival 26 midi mobile home. Go pony trekking at a new site in the Perigord region of the Dordogne introduced by Matthews Holidays (01483 284044, matthewsfrance.co.uk). Smaller children can ride a Shetland pony around marked paths at Camping Les Tourterelles at Tourtoirac while more experienced riders can go on a group trek. The site also has a pool, children's play area, tennis courts and volleyball and a bistro is open from early July to late August. Seven nights in a Focus Mobile Home starts from \u00a3278 in early May, rising to \u00a3898 for August, including midweek Dover-Calais ferry crossings.

Thomson Al Fresco (0870 1660366, thomsonalfresco.co.uk) has introduced free kids' clubs for 4-12 year olds at two of its 24 new sites: Chateau des Ormes and Yelloh! Village le Serignan Plage which operate May 24-September 5. Accommodation Sleep on Egyptian cotton sheets in real beds and bathe in semi-outdoor rainwater showers using Provencal toiletries at Mille Etoiles, a new luxury tented lodge in the Languedoc region of France.

Camping with a difference Go back to nature with Cornish Tipi Holidays (01208 880781, Cornish-tipi-holidays.co.uk).
