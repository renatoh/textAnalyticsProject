Otherwise known as Japanese horseradish (although not actually related), this gaspingly feisty condiment is well known to sushi lovers - applied in the tiniest dabs and smears, it adds a heat to those confections of raw fish and cold rice that brings them alive. Wasabi is derived from the root of a plant that grows in the cold, clear waters of Japan's mountain streams. So, as you might expect, pure wasabi is very expensive. To eat freshly grated root, you'll probably have to go to Japan, but wasabi pastes and powders are readily available. They often contain horseradish and mustard, but can still be very good. I like the powdered version produced by Mitoku (from goodnessdirect.co.uk) - you can mix it up in tiny quantities, which is ideal as wasabi quickly loses its punch when exposed to air. Ready-mixed pastes are also widely available, and their slight sweetness is rather pleasing with the nose-tingling heat of the spice. As well as serving it with sushi, you can blend wasabi with soy sauce as a dip for tempura. Or try stirring some into cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and dolloping it on to beetroot soup, mixing it into a dressing for thin slices of rare tuna or beef, or adding it to mashed avocado to make a stupendous dip. I also like it in cheese sandwiches. Just don't cook it, or its pungency will fade. \u00b7 Nikki Duffy is deputy editor of Waitrose Food Illustrated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
