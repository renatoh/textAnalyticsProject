In Dan Cole\u2019s case the moment arrived in February when a routine weights session at England\u2019s training base in Bagshot brought his professional life to a shuddering halt. \u201cI tried to do a bench press in the gym and basically had no power in my left arm,\u201d he says quietly. Only now, 10 months and a significant neck operation later, is he finally beginning to pick up where he left off. As he reels off the names of other Leicester players who have been successfully operated on by his renowned neck and spinal surgeon Peter Hamlyn \u2013 Tom Croft, Geoff Parling, Tom Youngs, Miles Benjamin etc \u2013 the brutal nature of his chosen trade becomes clearer still. Relatively speaking, Cole is one of the lucky ones but it is hard to feel that way when your colleagues are running around and you are lying at home wondering if, at 27, things will ever be quite the same again. With a World Cup looming, Cole had even more reason for reflection. One minute he was England\u2019s unshakeable first-choice at tighthead; the next, despite having missed only one of his country\u2019s previous 45 Tests, he was on the outside looking in. Toughest of all was watching England play in New Zealand in the summer, with Davey Wilson starting at tighthead. \u201cI did feel a bit sad,\u201d he says, recalling the June mornings on his sofa during the post-operative period when he was barred from doing any exercise. \u201cIt was massively boring. Everyone says: \u2018Why don\u2019t you go away travelling?\u2019 but you can\u2019t just sod off abroad for three months. I\u2019m not really a beach person anyway.\u201d In retrospect Cole suspects it was an accident waiting to happen. He first experienced a pain in his neck after Leicester\u2019s home defeat to Ulster in January \u2013 \u201cWhen I woke up the next morning I was even more stiff than usual\u201d \u2013 and, following his Bagshot breakdown, a scan revealed a bulging disc in his neck around his C6 and C7 vertebrae. \u201cSometimes you can prang a nerve and it weakens for a couple of weeks before coming back,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have surgery on your neck so I went to a specialist who recommended three months of rest to try to let the bulge settle. It didn\u2019t really do anything so they operated in May.\u201d Even at that stage the decision to undergo surgery was still a weighty one for an international prop forward, given the delicacy of the area involved. Cole\u2019s maternal grandfather was a Cumbrian coal miner who broke his back in a pit accident; no Leicester player will ever need reminding of the life-changing neck injury suffered by another Tigers prop, the remarkable Matt Hampson. \u201cI understand the forces that come through your neck,\u201d Cole says quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to mess around with it but the specialist who operated on me, Peter Hamlyn, knows sports people. That\u2019s reassuring because it\u2019s your livelihood. He\u2019s also already operated on half the Leicester team; seeing them come back and play you know you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Nevertheless, it has been a long, lonely process. \u201cI had three months before the operation and three months afterwards when you\u2019re not supposed to activate your neck muscles to give the disc the best chance to recover. I was doing pretty much zero: just sitting around. \u201cYour daily routine is gone so you\u2019ve basically got nothing to get up for in the morning. I would wander in, look at a bit of video, sit in a team meeting and eat a free lunch. It\u2019s tough when the boys are going through pre-season or when things are going wrong and you can\u2019t really do anything about it.\u201d Nagging away, too, has been the knowledge the game never stands still. Even before his injury Cole was being forced to come to terms with the changing dynamics of the scrum, the lawmaker\u2019s efforts to reduce the initial hit having given crafty looseheads a new lease of life. Cole is not naturally given to hyperbole \u2013 \u201cYou still have to bend over and push\u201d \u2013 but he believes the tighthead\u2019s job has changed appreciably. \u201cI think the tighthead has gone from more of a pure attacking role under the old regulations, where you\u2019d hit and chase, to more of a defensive role. \u201cThey\u2019ve closed the gap between the front rows and, as a tighthead, you\u2019ve got no momentum to fire through the scrum. You\u2019re more static and you have a greater responsibility to win your own ball. The value [you bring] has gone from being an attacking penalty machine to being defensive and not giving away penalties. I played under the rules last year, so it\u2019s not a total change, but people are more used to it this year. It\u2019s just a question of getting out there and doing it again.\u201d To complicate life still further, Leicester\u2019s next three games are home and away European ties with defending champions Toulon followed by a Premiership derby against last season\u2019s champions Northampton. Some key Tigers players are returning but, as Cole freely admits, his first foray back against Sale Sharks last month was a step into the unknown. \u201cBefore the game there was a bit of nervousness, not about the neck but about being crap. You\u2019ve been out for 10 months and you don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully I got thrown straight into a scrum and after that you\u2019re on autopilot. You just get on with the game.\u201d The next challenge is to force his way back into an England starting pack who have been gathering in strength in his absence. \u201cIn terms of pure set-piece, lineout ball, scrum, there aren\u2019t many better,\u201d nods Cole approvingly. \u201cYou look at that pack and it\u2019s going to be hard for anyone to get back in.\u201d Which makes Leicester\u2019s match with mighty Toulon on Sunday all the more important for England\u2019s returning pillar. \u201cYou can come across international packs but it\u2019s very rare you come across an international squad from one to 23. In some ways, it could be tougher than a Test match,\u201d he says. Happily, if the resilient Cole has mastered one skill in 2014, it is staying strong in adversity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
