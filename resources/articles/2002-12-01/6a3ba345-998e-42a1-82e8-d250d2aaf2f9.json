Peter Chingoka, president of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, said: \"It will be the largest sporting event in this country this decade and we are happy to take part.\" But Chingoka acknowledged that the ZCU had received numerous letters, phone calls and emails from cricket fans calling for the World Cup matches to be called off as a protest against President Robert Mugabe's government. There was immediate criticism from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. Its spokesman Paul Themba Nyathi said it would benefit the Mugabe government while the mayors of the host cities, Harare and Bulawayo, said they were in favour of some form of political protest at the matches. Harare's mayor Elias Mudzuri said: \"Everything is not OK in Zimbabwe. We have human rights abuses and people are going hungry and starving. We do not want Mugabe to be able to say that because we have World Cup matches going on the situation is fine.\" Mayor Mudzuri also suggested that competing cricketers should donate part of their earnings to the victims of political violence in Zimbabwe. Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive, said that the decision had been taken \"in the best interests of cricket\" and England's players and administrators both backed him. The former England batsman Dennis Amiss, the Warwickshire chief executive who succeeds Brian Bolus as chairman of the England management committee at the end of the year, said: \"Cricket is different. We're not into politics.\" Mike Gatting, who led the rebel England tour to apartheid-torn South Africa in 1990, said: \"They have been cleared by the ICC, so I suppose they should go.\" But he added: \"If someone wanted to drop out, I don't think anyone would criticise them.\" The England and Glamorgan spinner Robert Croft, who played in the 1999 World Cup, said: \"It is natural that politics is going to get mixed up with sport on occasions. The side that I'm more interested in is the players' safety. The question I would ask is: 'Are the players going to be safe?'\" Kent's all-rounder Mark Ealham, who also represented England in that World Cup, said: \"The big issue for me is safety. Provided the ICC can show things are safe and the England management are happy, then I'm sure the players will be happy. England have gone places before that haven't been completely politically sorted out.\" The Leicestershire and former England fast bowler Devon Malcolm said: \"If the ICC makes a recommendation that it is safe to play cricket there we have got to go.\" The Essex and former England batsman Aftab Habib said: \"It is not for political people to get involved with the World Cup because it has got nothing to do with them.\" But the popular view among county professionals was condemned by Gloucestershire's coach John Bracewell, who said: \"Frankly, it is very na\u00efve. Politics is part of every aspect of life and matters of human rights must be addressed. Now each individual cricketer should investigate this matter for himself.\" Paul Flynn, the Labour MP for Newport West and spokesman for the backbenchers who spoke out against going to Zimbabwe earlier this week, said: \"We can't get rid of all the tyrants in the world but we can make a significant protest in ways like this. The idea that politics and sport could be kept apart was exploded as a falsehood in 1969.\" Liz Willmott, spokeswoman for Amnesty International, said: \"We don't ask for boycotts as such but we do ask those people to go to these places to make themselves aware of the situation and make their feelings known.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
