In its report, the House of Lords committee on political polling and digital media also noted that the use of social media to adversely influence the political debate was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. There has been a \u201cwidespread loss of confidence in polling\u201d since 2015, when the pollsters failed to predict a Conservative win, the report says. There are also \u201cconcerns about the extent to which inaccurate polls might be shaping the \u2018narrative\u2019 during election campaigns, and therefore how they might be affecting the democratic process\u201d. As a result, the Lords recommend expanding the role of the British Polling Council, the self-regulatory body of the public polling industry, to go beyond simply ensuring transparency in how pollsters operate. In the future, the report says, the BPC should \u201cwork with the Electoral Commission, the Market Research Society and media regulators such as Ipso and Impress to ensure that the best methodologies are used, that sources of poll funding are declared, that polls are better reported and that polling performance is openly reviewed after each general election\u201d. Lord Lipsey, the chairman of the committee, said: \u201cThe polling industry needs to get its house in order. Otherwise the case for banning polling in the run-up to elections \u2013 one we for now reject \u2013 will become stronger. \u201cWe heard compelling evidence that polls influence the narrative around elections and thus go to the root of our democratic debate. This makes it vital they are conducted properly and held to the highest standards of accuracy.\u201d The committee also examined the role of social media during elections. It backed calls to require disclosure on online campaign material, requiring an imprint \u2013 similar to printed pamphlets \u2013 stating who has published it. \u201cThis will be crucial in helping to ensure that public confidence is maintained in the electoral system,\u201d the report says. It notes, however, \u201cthat this will do little to address the challenges posed by international actors who try to operate below the radar\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
