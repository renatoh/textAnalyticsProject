The latest IHS Markit/Cips monthly survey of the services sector, which accounts for three quarters of economic activity, showed that a recovery over the summer stalled in October, heaping further pressure on the Bank of England to boost its stimulus programme when officials meet this week. The central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee meets on Thursday to consider a big injection of funds to support the economy. While this was considered an unlikely prospect only a few weeks ago, most City analysts have predicted a \u00a3100bn increase in quantitative easing (QE), where the bank pumps money into the economy by acquiring government debt from financial institutions. IHS Markit said several months of falling consumer confidence, which has tracked the rise in the number of Covid-19, cases cut demand for hotels and restaurants while the government\u2019s policy of tiered lockdowns effectively halted a return to the office across much of the UK. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the services sector \u2013 which encompasses a range of industries from retail to hospitality and financial services \u2013 dropped to 51.4 in October, from 56.1 in September to come in below the consensus of City analysts and an earlier flash estimate of 52.3. The composite PMI, which includes the manufacturing sector, declined to 52.1, from 56.5 in September. Tim Moore, IHS\u2019s economics director, said the data, which was collected between 12 and 28 October, before the second nationwide lockdown was announced, showed the economy \u201cseems on course for a double-dip recession this winter and a far more challenging path to recovery in 2021\u201d. Two successive quarters of negative growth \u2013 which occurred in the first six months of 2020 \u2013 constitute a recession, with the term \u201cdouble-dip\u201d used to describe two downturns in quick succession. The PMI report said employment across the services sector declined for the eight consecutive month, while customer-facing service providers, especially those in hotels, restaurants and catering, suffered a slump. New orders fell for the first time since June. \u201cA lack of forward bookings in parts of the economy most affected by lockdown measures led to widespread reports of redundancies and another sharp fall in total employment numbers during October,\u201d Moore said. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cMarkit\u2019s survey suggests the recovery essentially ground to a halt in October.\u201d He said the impact would be revealed in lower GDP growth, which would stay about 8% below its pre-Covid peak by the end of the year. October marked a turning point on several fronts, he said, arguing that a sharp drop in the use of public and private transport and a slump in demand for discretionary consumer services contributed to a broader slowdown. \u201cThe second wave of Covid-19 is the obvious driver of the slowdown, though the recovery likely would have decelerated anyway, given that pent-up demand after the first lockdown ended temporarily pushed activity in the consumer services sector above its sustainable level over the summer.\u201d Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThere seems little doubt that a renewed national lockdown will cause the economy to contract again in the fourth quarter \u2013 and, very possibly, by an appreciable amount.\u201d The EY Item Club\u2019s initial forecast is that there could be a GDP contraction of 5-8% in the fourth quarter. Citing the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations, Archer added: \u201cEven before a new national lockdown in England \u2013 as well as varying measures announced so far in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 the fourth quarter was looking much more challenging for the UK economy, and it was likely there would be a marked rise in unemployment as the furlough scheme drew to a close in October, even allowing for the government\u2019s latest, more generous job support measures. \u201cOn top of that, business caution has been added to by uncertainties over whether the UK and EU will reach a trade agreement by 31 December.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
