He does not really do mundanity. More often he provokes superlatives, which hail inimitable strokeplay or lament another monumental indiscretion. Seldom do we ponder the old pro Pietersen ploughing on. Yet here he is in Brisbane on the threshold of his 100th Test cap, eight years after he skipped on to the turf at Lord's against Australia with that badger haircut, which he wisely chose to cull (without any protest from anyone) before too long. Since then he has never been dropped from England's Test team \u2013 for cricketing reasons, that is. He was omitted on disciplinary grounds in August 2012 and he has missed six Tests through injury (three against Australia in 2009, three against New Zealand earlier this year). The figures make him a dogged old trooper. Admittedly the landmark has been slightly devalued in recent times. The volume of cricket is such that the goal of 100 appearances is far more attainable than it was. Around the corner there is Alastair Cook, still only 28 years of age, with 97 Test caps; Ian Bell has 93; Jimmy Anderson 87. All three can be expected to join the club. It took Colin Cowdrey 14 years to get there, Geoff Boycott 17 and Alec Stewart 10. For Pietersen the trek has lasted a mere eight. Cowdrey, Boycott and Stewart all marked the occasion by hitting a century. What price Pietersen emulating them at the Gabba? So, barring the intervention of dodgy knees or texts over the next few days, Pietersen becomes No10 in the England 100 Test caps club. He has the highest batting average (48) of all of them; he has hit more centuries than any of them \u2013 until Cook joins him in a list that contains only one proper bowler (Ian Botham). And he shares first place with Boycott in his capacity to divide opinion of cricket fans, team-mates and journalists alike. There is probably a sliding scale of devotion among those three categories \u2013 with fans at the top. There is no question that he belongs in this company. Forget the off-field shenanigans. At the crease Pietersen has been the most mesmerising England batsman of the past two decades. His best innings, the 158 at The Oval against Australia in 2005, his 149 against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 (even if it ultimately caused more trouble than it was worth) or his 186 in Mumbai late last year, all spring to mind. They were breathtaking affairs, during which he might lurch from early myopic groping to imperious splendour in the space of one shot. Among England batsmen in living memory only Botham has had the gall to embark on such preposterous strokemaking as Pietersen (but Botham, unlike Pietersen, had the fallback position of being a world-class bowler, which therefore gave him licence). So Pietersen could be seen switch-hitting Muttiah Muralitharan for six in a Test match at Edgbaston \u2013 \"the only place I could see myself hitting him for a boundary\"; straight-driving Dale Steyn back over his head for six at Headingley; and flamingo-flicking Shane Warne through mid-wicket against the spin in Adelaide. These were the best bowlers of the era and he was truly content only while subduing them. Now Pietersen is in the autumn of his career. The body is creaking. When he sets off for that first single it is not only the non-striker who looks on with trepidation; so does the physiotherapist. Often it takes longer for him to acclimatise at the crease. Yet to the Australians he surely remains the most coveted of England wickets in this series. This is partly to do with his personality. Pietersen, it cannot be disguised, gets up noses more easily than the vast majority of cricketers. Opponents revel in his failure. But it is also to do with pragmatism. Look back at that list and only Andrew Strauss (with 47 wins in 100 matches) and Cowdrey (44 wins in 114) have experienced more Test victories than Pietersen (42 wins in 99). This is an infinitely superior record to Mike Atherton (31 in 115) or Graham Gooch and David Gower (32 in 118 and 117 matches respectively). Pietersen has been a winner for the bulk of his Test career. The cynics may decide that he has been lucky to play in a good side. It may be nearer the truth to say that Pietersen's presence has been a major factor in the success of those England teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
