It was New York Comic Con and around me flourished a sea of black and brown faces, many partially concealed beneath goggles, prosthetic zombie wounds or masks. For one of the first times since I started writing speculative fiction five years ago, I felt at home in my own genre. Earlier this summer, the old guard of fantasy got very uncomfortable over a petition I started asking for the World Fantasy Award to remove the bust of HP Lovecraft as its statuette and replace it with Octavia Butler. Lovecraft was an uneven craftsman at best \u2013 his stories clunk along, overburdened with adjectives and stale characters. It\u2019s his world-building and imagination that helped solidify his legacy, but even that is tainted by a failure of craft and humanity. He detailed his rabid, paranoid racism in many letters, and it permeates his mythos. Lovecraft peopled his fiction with hordes of swarthy, child-killing and abjectly stupid black and brown people, while women are almost non-existent. Supporters of the Lovecraft statue point out his influence on the fantasy genre, and they\u2019re right: today, we\u2019re still struggling to unravel the legacy of racism and erasure with which he and other early speculative fiction writers permeated their work. Mainstream science fiction and fantasy narratives continue to center on white saviour narratives, as we saw recently on Game of Thrones. Villainous, sexualised or helpless, rarely are non-white characters presented with the same humanity and depth as white ones. As Imran Siddiquee points out at the Atlantic, teen dystopias tend to have a glaring blindspot when it comes to talking about more complex issues of power and privilege: \u201cWhile recent dystopias warn youth about over-reliance on computers, totalitarian rule, class warfare, pandemic panics and global warming, very few ask audiences to think deeply about sexism and racism \u2026The results feel false, and undercut the films\u2019 attempts to comment on the present day.\u201d And while \u201curban\u201d has become publishing industry code for books by and for black people, throw the word fantasy on the end and suddenly the characters and authors are very white. In this literary gentrification, the American city becomes either a goofy whitewashed playground, Girls with werewolves and vampires, or an abysmal urban nightmare. And like most dystopias, neither fictionalized versions of this city have much to say about the real-world conflicts threatening urban communities of color like police violence and gentrification. Unfortunately, this shouldn\u2019t surprise us. According to a recent survey, Latinos and Asians make up 3% of the publishing industry each, while blacks come in at 1%. As Publishers Weekly puts it: \u201cthe world of speculative fiction faces the same challenge as the rest of publishing: overcoming a long history of books being primarily created by, for, and about straight white men.\u201d The racial makeup of the industry matters. For writers who aren\u2019t straight, cis, white men, the already steep uphill road to publication is complicated by issues of cultural translation, representation, passive and microaggressions, rage, and assimilation, among others. It\u2019s impossible to know which of our truths will unsettle the privileged sensibilities of one of the many gatekeepers we face along the way. \u201cWhy Butler?\u201d people asked me when the petition went up, and I remembered how entrenched we all get in our own corners within the genre. Butler\u2019s prose soars where Lovecraft\u2019s stumbles. Her characters live and breathe, confront complexities of power and privilege amid fantastical, terrifying dreamscapes steeped in history and nuance. My SFF community is mostly black and brown, and Butler inspired many of us to start writing in the first place. These folks congregate more often than not in online communities like the Nerds of Color, Black Girl Nerds and the Fan Bros, because outside of ComicCon, SFF cons have historically not been safe spaces for women and people of color. These are the online communities that signed the petition in the thousands, which is what transformed it from being just another attempt at dethroning Lovecraft as the face of one of fantasy\u2019s highest awards (there have been several) to a global conversation with coverage in Salon, the Guardian, NPR and countless blogs. Ultimately, the Lovecraft statue must go. He may be replaced by Butler, or Carrie Cuinn\u2019s sea serpent wrapped around the world idea or any of the many other options, but the fantasy community cannot embrace its growing fanbase of color with one hand while deifying a writer who happily advocated for our extermination with the other. Read Lovecraft, be inspired by his wild imagination, repelled by his heinous worldview, learn from his mistakes \u2013 I certainly have. But the lionizing, sugarcoating and kneejerk flurry to defend and silence uncomfortable histories has to stop if we are to move forward. People of color have been fantasy creators and fans for a long time; we\u2019re not going anywhere. The We Need Diverse Books campaign took the internet by storm this year and is still going strong. A recent digital renaissance in online speculative fiction magazines like Tor.com, Crossed Genres and Strange Horizons, has helped give rise to a new, flourishing generation of writers of color. Networks executives have started to take notice. More importantly though, we\u2019ve stopped asking permission and begun finding ways of making our voices heard. Social media revolutionized fandom in ways few saw coming, and content creators of color find ourselves with unprecedented access to audiences. We\u2019re entering a new time \u2013 one not so enraptured by the same tired hierarchies \u2013 and the genre itself will be stronger for leaving its oppressive tropes behind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
