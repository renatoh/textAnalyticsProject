Sajeel Shahid, who has repeatedly refused to be questioned by police about the attacks, set up Ummah Fitness Centre (UFC) and Ad-Deen primary school, both in Ilford, east London. Khuram Butt, who with Rachid Redouane and Youseff Zaghba killed eight people on the night of 3 June 2017, worked at both locations. Redouane also worked at the gym and Zaghba worked at the school. All three men also trained at UFC, where it is suggested they may have planned and prepared the attack. Shahid\u2019s links with the trio have come under scrutiny during the inquest at the Old Bailey into the eight victims because of his past membership of the extremist group al-Muhajiroun (ALM), with an MI5 boss describing him as having a \u201cstrong historical extremist pedigree\u201d. Additionally, in the 2007 \u201cfertiliser\u201d trial of men accused of plotting to blow up Bluewater shopping centre and the Ministry of Sound nightclub, Mohammed Junaid Babar, a US terrorist turned FBI supergrass, accused Shahid of setting up the Malakand camp in Pakistan, where the 7 July bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan is said to have trained. But Shahid, 43, said he left ALM after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 \u2013 before Butt joined \u2013 and denounced Babar and the media for spreading lies about him. He told the inquest on Monday that the reason he refused to speak to police in the aftermath of the attack was because he was not involved and feared further vilification from the media. Shahid said he exchanged few words with Butt when the latter was working on the reception at the gym and had no social contact with him. \u201cHow am I supposed to know what he is thinking, what he is planning, what was in his mind?\u201d said Shahid, whose identity was hidden during his evidence. \u201cIf I ever knew he was capable of anything like this, I would have reported him to police and had him arrested.\u201d The court heard that in December 2016, January 2017 and May 2017 (Shahid was in the Netherlands in the interim months) there were 77 calls, 39 connected, between a number registered to Shahid and Butt\u2019s phone. There were also 329 text messages between the numbers. Shahid said he could not remember what the communications were about but suggested it was probably \u201cgym things\u201d, adding that his ex-partner sometimes used his phone as well. After Shahid confirmed he had the phone in question in court and, subject to his lawyer\u2019s assent, would be willing to show it to police, Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquest, told him: \u201cI understand that police will be asking to look at your phone before you leave court.\u201d Asked if he would comply and not delete any material from his phone beforehand, Shahid agreed. He told the court: \u201cI have never been arrested or charged or questioned by police or MI5. I am 43 years old. If I was such a horrible person as the media makes out, that would have happened \u2026 I am a law-obeying citizen.\u201d The inquest is due to conclude this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
