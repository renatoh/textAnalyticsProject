Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), who has long been the show\u2019s main vehicle for channelling the madness of the Trump era generally, and the mouthpiece for liberal fury specifically, is at first in conversation \u2026 with the bruises on her husband\u2019s back, caused by Eric and Donald Trump Jr who accidentally (buck)shot him the day before when he took them on safari, and which have now morphed into the goblin heirs\u2019 faces and are speaking to her. Like I said: extended riff. Eventually Diane cuts them off. \u201cWhat has happened to men?\u201d she whispers with the kind of Arctic fury only Baranski can muster. \u201cWhat happened to men who were slow to anger and who took responsibility and who didn\u2019t cry like whiny little bitches? What happened to Paul Newman and Burt Lancaster? When did Trump and Kavanaugh become our idea of aggrieved men? With quivering lips, blaming everyone but themselves?\u201d Her controlled explosion erupts in the middle of an episode exploring the various manifestations of the #MeToo era. A planned tribute to the firm\u2019s founder and civil rights activist, Carl Reddick, becomes damning testimony when his former secretary reveals that the revered man sexually harassed and raped her throughout her employment. The stenographer attending the meeting convened by the partners to tackle the problem recuses herself on the grounds that he did it to her too. Reporter Naomi Nivola (Keesha Sharp), the former law student who confronted Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo) in the last series about his neglect of other female students in pursuit of the one who eventually became his wife, is soon sniffing around the case. But it turns out that her real interest is in the firm\u2019s shutting down of the Assholes to Avoid website, which warned women about workplace creeps. Back from maternity leave, Lucca (Cush Jumbo) is offered the chance to head the divorce department because the man who was going to take up the job has \u201cissues\u201d in his past, but is unsure whether to construe it as a promotion or a shunting into a backwater. A super-pissed off Diane, meanwhile, recontacts the shadowy woman who alleges that she had an affair with Trump, that he paid for an abortion and that she is in touch with many other women with similar stories. Diane thinks she\u2019s found a loophole in the non-disclosure agreement the woman signed. When it\u2019s not enough to persuade her to come forward, Diane goes rogue and takes the story to Nivola. Yes, The Good Fight has a ripped-from-the-headlines vibe and retains its whimsical streak in this episode by making over drippy Maia (Rose Leslie) with some cool sunglasses and vocal tips from Marisa (Sarah Steele). But unlike the Law &amp; Order franchise \u2013 the most famous practitioner of that dark art \u2013 The Good Fight takes shards of the zeitgeist, holds them up to the light and examines them, twisting and turning them this way and that in its scripts until they are fully illuminated. The Assholes to Avoid storyline is clearly inspired by the Shitty Media Men spreadsheet which was controversially compiled and circulated last year to the same ends. But it becomes part of the show\u2019s endless questioning of conscience and compromise and how to lead a good enough life in an increasingly unforgiving world. The Good Wife spinoff has now become fully its own thing \u2013 even if that thing, with its welter of tones and moods, from levity to despair, and frequently experimental forms (the episode also included a cartoon song video explaining non-disclosure agreements, on top of the talking pellet wounds) \u2013 resists simple classification. But, courtesy of watertight scripts, the unassailable instinct for good stories and talent for telling them of creators Robert and Michelle King, and endlessly brilliant performances from the actors in every tier, it sweeps you along with it entirely. All while constantly undermining the Hollywood shibboleth that big audiences can\u2019t be found by shows with racially diverse casts and/or main parts for older women. So much good fighting done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
