The afternoon began with a talk by the dolphin trainer, as we dangled our feet over the edge of the jetty and watched the dolphins spiral around in the water below. They opened their jaws to reveal a long line of triangular teeth, more great white than bottlenose. Our trainer asked if we had any questions before entering the water. An ambitious seven-year-old wanted to know how to become a dolphin trainer. One kid asked if dolphins were fish; the trainer threw the question back at us. The same kid put his hand up, yelling \"Mammal!\" The final question came from a small boy: \"Do we have to do this?\" How much physical courage should we expect of a child? This boy was clearly terrified. But on holiday, we expect our children to rise to physical challenges they would never face at home. In Grand Bahama, my nine-year-old has been kayaking with us. She was hugely reluctant to go, and didn't particularly enjoy the two-hour paddle up a mangrove creek (bahamasvg.com/kayak.html). Her parents thought this a character-strengthening experience for her, but she just thought it grim and damp. I'm still undecided whether we should have forced her. Parents are encouraged to over-protect their children. But why should we make them do something they don't want to? So my daughter and I have done a deal. If I force her to do something next time we go away, I have to do a bungee jump. Somehow, I think she'll be allowed to stay by the pool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
