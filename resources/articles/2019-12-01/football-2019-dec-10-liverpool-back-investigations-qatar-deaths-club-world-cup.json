The Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, has also sought assurances from the Qatar \u201csupreme committee\u201d, which is organising the tournament and the 2022 World Cup, about the progress of investigations into the deaths of two men who had been working on the construction of football stadiums. Moore set out Liverpool\u2019s position in a letter to Nicholas McGeehan and James Lynch, directors of the Fair/Square human rights organisation, who asked him in November to make a public statement of concern about workers\u2019 rights and deaths in Qatar. They highlighted the risks of the intense heat and humidity for people employed on the vast construction projects in the Gulf, citing medical research published in July into deaths of Nepalese workers in Qatar, which concluded that \u201cthe increased cardiovascular mortality during hot periods most likely is due to severe heat stress\u201d. McGeehan and Lynch specifically highlighted the death in June of Rupchandra Rumba, 24, a Nepali who died in his lodgings during his period of employment as a scaffolder at the Education City stadium, which was originally designated for Liverpool to play their matches. Rumba\u2019s Qatari death certificate, as is common in the country, attributed his death to a generalised \u201cacute cardio-respiratory failure due to natural causes\u201d, which McGeehan and Lynch described as \u201cnot a certifiable cause of death, meaning that Rumpchandra\u2019s death remains unexplained\u201d. McGeehan, formerly Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Lynch, previously a deputy director at Amnesty, have called for full investigations into the deaths in Qatar and the effects of heat. They cited the climate data and conclusions of medical experts, reported by the Guardian in October, that hundreds of migrant workers are dying in Qatar every year due to heat stress. Moore said in his reply that Liverpool had \u201csought background detail assurances\u201d from the supreme committee about the status of the investigation into Rumba\u2019s death and the progress of compensation for Rumba\u2019s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, and their six-year-old son, Niraj. After Liverpool\u2019s designated venue was moved to the Khalifa International stadium Moore said they had also discussed with the supreme committee the ongoing investigation headed by Sir Robert Akenhead into the death in January 2017 of the British construction worker Zac Cox, who fell from rigging at that stadium. \u201cLike any responsible organisation, we support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve,\u201d Moore wrote in his reply to McGeehan and Lynch. \u201cFurthermore we also believe that employees should be treated with fairness and respect, which is why we adhere to our own anti-slavery policy and why we are committed to paying the real living wage, among various measures of this kind. These are the standards that we set for ourselves and by which we would hope to be judged given they fall within our own remits and responsibilities. \u201cNevertheless, we remain a sporting organisation and it is important that we are not drawn into global issues on the basis of where our involvement in various competitions dictates that our fixtures take place. So while we respect and understand the reasons why you have sought a public pronouncement from us, we hope you will respect and understand why we feel such a course of action would not be appropriate. \u201cHaving already stated that while we do not visit any country with the objective of bringing about change, but any resultant positive changes would be welcomed, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate that particular message.\u201d McGeehan told the Guardian that he welcomed Liverpool\u2019s intervention: \u201cIn their detailed expression of support for investigations into worker deaths and compensation for families, Liverpool have demonstrated more clarity of thought than Fifa and all of their sponsors put together,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
