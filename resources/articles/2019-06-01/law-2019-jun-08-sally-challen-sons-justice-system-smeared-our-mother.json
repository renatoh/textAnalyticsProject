In doing so it failed to recognise the decades of abuse and coercive control she had suffered at his hands, David Challen writes in an article for today\u2019s Observer that is heavily critical of how abused women continue to be viewed by the courts, a concern that women\u2019s rights campaigners said they shared. Sally Challen, 65, was 56 when she bludgeoned 61-year-old Richard Challen to death with a hammer in 2010. She was jailed for life for murder, but the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered for next month. However, the Crown accepted her plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, meaning she had served her time in prison. While hailing the verdict as a \u201cwatershed\u201d, David writes: \u201cHow has our mother\u2019s case come to be so inaccurately portrayed by the criminal justice system? Why do we continue to label women who kill as jealous, cold murderers and refuse to explore evidence of abuse?\u201d He explains that his mother was only 15 when she met their father, who was 21. \u201cAt first he was charming, but gradually the abuse began,\u201d David writes. \u201cHe bullied and humiliated her, isolated her from her friends and family, controlled who she could socialise with, controlled her money, restricted her movement and created a culture of fear and dependency. \u201cOur father fed into our mother\u2019s mind the abuse she was suffering over 40 years was normal.\u201d But this behaviour was not examined during the original trial, meaning, David writes, that for \u201calmost a decade my brother James and I have been forced to accept a false narrative of our father\u2019s death that depicted our mother as a controlling and jealous lover who planned to kill our father\u201d. Legal experts described the verdict as significant. Rebecca Christie, who specialises in family law at Hunters solicitors, said: \u201cThe judgment shows a greater understanding by the courts of the effects of psychological abuse and reflects the view of those living in modern-day Britain, that domestic abuse can not only be defined as physical but also emotional, financial or sexual.\u201d But David Challen is more critical. \u201cDangerous myths about victims of domestic violence who appear well put-together and are judged to be unaffected are continuously played out in open court,\u201d he writes. Tab Morton, of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said the case \u201chas been a watershed for judicial understanding of coercive control\u201d. However, she added: \u201cIt is also worth noting that it was evidence of Challen\u2019s mental health conditions, and not the abuse which exacerbated them, which led to her murder charge being reduced. This feeds into the harmful idea that women must be either \u2018mad\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 to commit violence. Rather, abuse itself is a cause of mental ill-health.\u201d Women who experience abuse are three times as likely to develop a mental health condition than those who do not, according to research by Birmingham University published in the British Journal of Psychiatry last week. Morton said: \u201cRather than pathologising abused women to rationalise their behaviour, our judicial system urgently needs to understand and address the impact of prolonged abuse itself.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to clarify the age difference between Sally Challen and Richard Challen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
