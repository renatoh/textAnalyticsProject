The big debate is not about whether salary capping should be introduced but when. As yet there is no consensus on what form it should take. Some clubs such as Milan, who took part in Uefa's working group on a system of club licensing through which salary capping might be regulated, would like to see a fixed percentage of club turnover set aside for players' wages. This might be somewhere between 50 and 70% of annual turnover but football officials stress that they are nowhere near reaching a final figure. Under such a system, all clubs within Europe would have to adhere to the accepted figure, otherwise they would not be granted a club licence and thus not allowed to compete in any Uefa competitions. Another system being considered by football officials is a flat-rate squad salary cap. This has been introduced in other sports such as rugby, ice hockey and US sports. The governing bodies of these sports set a figure for how much can be spent on salaries each year and all clubs have to stick to it. The third system being considered by Europe's leading clubs is for a limit on squad sizes, possibly set at 25 players. However, it is thought that finding a consensus on squad numbers may be almost impossible. Simon Banks, a football finance analyst, said: \"There are several methods that clubs could adopt but the consensus is that salary capping will be introduced at some stage. \"Salary capping has worked very well in rugby, where it is administered by lawyers. The problem with football is that it is much more of an open market and any capping system would have to operate across the whole of this market. That is why capping can only work if Uefa is responsible for it.\" The Ipswich Town chairman David Sheepshanks claimed recently that it was only a matter of time before salary capping was introduced. \"There is no doubt that clubs have realised that it is time for a slowdown,\" he said. \"I believe it is prudent management of a football club to spend between 50 to 70% of their turnover on wages but a couple of years ago nine out of the 20 Premiership clubs were paying wages that amounted to over 70% of turnover.\" The Premier League says it is \"sceptical\" that a realistic salary limit could be set for all Premiership clubs. For those sports that have capped salaries it has proved to be a success. Rugby league's deputy chief executive Dave Callaghan said: \"We have a salary cap and it has proved a very successful venture. I believe it has certainly saved clubs going out of business.\" Rugby union also has a salary cap. The 12 clubs that make up the Premiership are allowed to spend only \u00a31.85m each on players' wages per season. This will rise to \u00a31.97m in 2004-05. From next season a uniform salary cap is to be introduced throughout Europe. Damian Hopley, chief executive of the rugby union players' union, said that the players had realised that the game was spiralling out of control. \"We recognised that the sport was in dire straits and that the professional club game was about to disappear down a black hole. \"The players had to make a decision to plump for \u00a350,000 per annum over two or three years rather than a one-year contract was worth \u00a3100,000. We could not rely on owners pumping money into the game to keep clubs afloat any longer. \"Clearly the omens for football finance are not good and something will have to give. And players' salaries are bound to be a target.\" Football clubs see capping as an ideal way to plan financially for the future. But the experience of US sports, where salary caps have led to strikes or the threat of strikes by players, shows the potential dangers. Most Premier League clubs are still cushioned by television money and high gate receipts compared with their European counterparts. But wages in England are growing at a faster rate than turnover and on current trends by 2007 players' wages will account for 100% of the Premier League's turnover.
