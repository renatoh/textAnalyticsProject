A couple of weeks ago, when in the US, I asked people round the dinner table what would happen to American newspapers. Unanimously they thought most would fold. Would they pay for web news content? No \u2013 not even for Murdoch's. Where did they get their news from? \"National Public Radio\" \u2013 a not-for-profit organisation paid for mainly by donations, which also has an excellent website. Alan Machin Halifax, West Yorkshire \u2022\u2008Your percipient columnist Martin Kelner (Sport, 31 August) takes the BBC to task for its late-night scheduling of the Football League Show, saying quite rightly that \"the suspicion will persist that the BBC is less than committed to football beyond the Premier League\". Stones and glass houses came to mind as I checked on the Guardian's coverage of the weekend's football. Premier League pages: six. Football League pages: a half. Red card, surely. Michael Palin London \u2022\u2008I hope as a result of the current ills engulfing the sport of rugby union (Andrew blames professional era for rugby's ills, Sport, 1 September) that one recommendation to come out of the RFU's taskforce will be a UK chapter of the sports arbitration court at Lausanne. New York and Sydney already have a version. With London hosting the Olympicds and Paralympics this becomes even more important. Derek Wyatt MP Chairman, All-party parliamentary groups for rugby union and London 2012 \u2022\u2008As you drive out of London on the A40, just after the Heathrow turn-off, there is a large, signposted Polish war memorial. It has been there for quite some time. I have never visited it, but it is visible from the road. What's unofficial about it (Britain finally honours Polish war effort with first official memorial, 1 September)? Philip Horowitz London \u2022\u2008We would commend the Plantin-Moretus Museum of Typography in Antwerp (Letters, 31 August), but perhaps you wouldn't print it in the Grauniad.
