After England\u2019s victory over Italy he was not playing ball but a better example was when, after beating Wales, he made his true feelings known about the Principality Stadium roof controversy, saying rugby union is \u201ca winter sport\u201d. Jones is also always at pains to protect his players so, when he talked on Saturday evening of how keen England were to face New Zealand later this year, it felt like an obvious way to deflect from being outfought and out-thought by Ireland \u2013 even though there was no doubt some truth in it. The mooted fixture has not gone down particularly well in New Zealand. It is hardly Jones\u2019s fault but the New Zealand Herald splashed with \u2018Grudge Match\u2019 last week as the RFU\u2019s intentions became increasingly clear. Perhaps a defeat for England takes the sting out of the showdown but then again both sides reached 18 consecutive victories before being beaten by Ireland. Writing in the New Zealand Herald, Chris Rattue says it is Ireland, rather than \u201cstilted\u201d and \u201coverrated\u201d England, who can claim to be the second best side in the world. \u201cAs almost always happens to England under pressure, they lose the ability to pass the ball smartly,\u201d writes Rattue. \u201cEngland were wrecking balls in chains. A lot of them looked like overstuffed plastic shopping bags in desperate need of a trolley.\u201d \u201cEngland \u2013 with one victory in the last 15 Tests against New Zealand \u2013 are light years away from living up to the hype,\u201d he continued. \u201cEngland aren\u2019t even the second best team in the world, despite what the primitive ranking system claims. Ireland, under the astute coaching of Joe Schmidt, deserve that respect.\u201d Of the potential fixture, which the RFU is pursuing despite the All Blacks being pencilled in to face the Barbarians on 4 November he says: \u201cThere was no genuine point to it, and even less so now. It was a fanciful sugar rush which has been nailed by the bitter truth about Jones and his overrated team.\u201d In Ireland meanwhile victory over England was ranked just below their 40-29 triumph over the All Blacks in Chicago last November. \u201cThis may not have been quite the scalp which a first win in 111 years over New Zealand represented but, given the circumstances, it wasn\u2019t far behind,\u201d writes Gerry Thornley in the Irish Times. Perhaps it was the Cyprus Rugby Federation that was most pleased. Ireland\u2019s victory means their national side\u2019s world record of 24 consecutive victories remains intact. The governing body tweeted thanks to Schmidt\u2019s team, with a photograph of a pint of Guinness and the caption, \u201crude not to\u2026\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
