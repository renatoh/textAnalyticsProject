The problem is how we live now. Rich food, the stress of modern existence and sedentary occupations all combined to place 21st-century men and women in danger of sudden seizure. Only one cardiovascular condition is in rapid decline. There are not so many bleeding hearts as there used to be. Bleeding hearts can be easily diagnosed. People who possess them read in their newspapers that illegal action has forced the Hall family to abandon breeding guinea pigs for medical research - and they feel sorry for the guinea pigs. As they read that the protesters snatched the body of an elderly Hall relative from her grave, they see in their minds eye only rodents with electrodes in their brains. Last week, sufferers from the distressing condition realised exactly how martyrs to hay fever feel on days of high pollen count. As well as being reminded of what laboratories do to animals, they were forced to think about low-paid Asian women being sacked from Gate Gourmet and the Kachepa family being deported to Malawi. Bleeding heart must have got very close to epidemic proportions. The distress caused to chronic cases was undoubtedly increased by the knowledge that they had succumbed to what, in modern society, has become a socially unacceptable disease - comparable to the contagion against which young men used to be warned by means of poster in public lavatories. They are constantly told that there are painful decisions to be taken and that progress depends on the existence of people with the courage to take them. That denigration of the bleeding heart is unjustified. There is, however, a legitimate complaint to be made against many of the unfortunates who have contracted the disease. They feel, but they do not act. Concerned as they are for the welfare of primates, they rarely demonstrate outside laboratories. They will vote for the re-election of a government that sends Mrs Kachepa home and gladly take advantage of cheap BA flights. Many of them eat battery-reared chickens. Despite those flaws of character, society would be far worse without them. Their hearts, although bleeding, are in the right place. They understand the importance of what the Victorians called the tender virtues. And they are brave enough to face ridicule for what has become one of the sins of our time - being soft. That generally derided condition is most despised when it is animals - particularly small animals - who are the recipient of the concern. Self-styled realists argue that people who worry about the welfare of guinea pigs should spend their time worrying about something more important. They are wrong. Show me a man who ill treats his dog and I will show you a man who is generally insensitive to suffering. Compassion is indivisible. The notion that the generous impulse is in such short supply that each of us has to ration its distribution is just one example of the claptrap spouted in defence of so-called realism. Watching the chairman of Gate Gourmet explain on television that his workers had a choice to make between lower labour costs and the company going into administration, it was impossible to believe that, even were the worst to happen, he would lose his house and sign on at the job centre. Reality has to be faced by the weak and poor. In truth, although a bleeding heart is brought on by an excess of emotion, blind faith in the need to be tough is a product of a different, but equally irrational, impulse - the romantic attachment to the heroic figure who does not flinch from the horrors of battle. Since most of us live by one myth or another, better by far the gentle variety. It may be that gentle people do not change the world. But they often deflect it on to a more acceptable axis. It is possible to argue that research into the causes of genetic disease make some animal experiments essential but still to shudder at the thought of what those experiments entail. The shudder is important. Had it not reverberated through society 50 years ago, animals would still be used to test the effects of cosmetics. John Galsworthy - so often regarded as no more then the apologist for Soames Forsyte, hard on himself and hard on others - was also the author of Justice, the story of a humble clerk wrongly accused of forgery, and Strife, a play about exploited tinplate workers on strike. He also had a strong view about animal welfare. It encouraged the critic James Agate to call him a \"whole humane society in himself\". Agate explained that Galsworthy \"sided with the fox against the man in pink, the hen coop against the marauding fox, the chickweed against the chicken and what ever it is the chickweed preys on, against that fearsome plant\". It is hard to imagine a prouder epitaph."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
