Revenues grew by just 0.8% to $27.23 billion, but were down by 5% when adjusted for currency changes. This suggests that corporate IT spending has yet to rebound from the recession, though IBM predicted that full year profits would be ahead of expectations. In a conference call, IBM's chief financial officer Mark Loughridge said: \"We do see some encouraging signs in our business, but I'd like to get into the first quarter and get a little more validation this is an on-going recovery before we take this up further than we have.\" This quarter marked the first increase in revenues since September 2008, and continued the trend whereby declines in hardware revenues are made up for by increases in revenues from software and services (though revenues from Lotus software declined by 5%). However, IBM's numbers have become more consistent since it spun off or sold various divisions, including its PC division, which was taken over by China's Lenovo. For the full year, 2009, IBM's net income grew by 9% to $13.4bn while revenues fell by 8% (or 5%, adjusting for currency) to $95.8bn. Turnover was $103.6bn in 2008."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
