My friend was rightly chuffed and it became something of a joke between us, partly because I was jealous and partly because it's a weird idea. I mean, can you \"wear\" erudition at all? I don't for one moment doubt the erudition of Meaghan Delahunt's conscientious, semi-factual novel about Trotsky's exile in Mexico. The trouble is, she wears it like chain mail, clunking around in it with deafening lack of conviction. Which is a shame, because she has manfully attempted something gargantuan, especially for a first-timer. But novels based on history carry a double burden. They must first justify themselves (what does fiction bring to this that a biog doesn't?) and then, having weighed themselves down with all that research, dare to shrug it off. A meticulous \"factual\" novel must feel as loose and light as any tale pulled from thin air. Facts, especially famous ones, must be subtly introduced, like a hand slipped into yours while you're deep in thought: warm, sweet, barely noticeable. And Delahunt's facts are big ones: the Russian Revolution, the tragedy of Trotsky's exile and assassination, the slower, less heroic death of Stalin. She also charts the odd relationship between the sexually wistful Trotsky, his gentle, long-suffering wife and the fiery Frida Kahlo, who goes to bed with him to make her husband (the womanising Diego Rivera) jealous. You feel impressed at how painstakingly Delahunt must have structured her narrative to make the sliding timescales work, so that the gobbets of history line up and the conflicting viewpoints ricochet off one another. But you begin to wish she were less conscientious - that she'd let go occasionally. So bent is she on driving home her facts, her dates, her understanding of the period, that every one of her half a dozen narrators sounds identical. So many italics; so many enigmatic, one-line paras; so many touchy-feely phrases. Can she possibly intend that Trotsky, his executioner and Stalin all speak like intense and dreamy women? Instead of honing his ice pick, Ramon the assassin emotes passionately and articulately about Kahlo's paintings. One of Kahlo's lovers reflects on how she made him \"alert to the aches in my life\". Who are these New Men? Why did they waste time electrifying the Soviet Union when they clearly had such promising careers ahead of them as Virago novelists? But even more fatal is the relentless way Delahunt lobs her history at us. So many dates, so little time. In case we get lost, characters conveniently lie down on divans and \"remember\" for us. Trotsky helpfully recalls precisely what radio music he listened to and, like a bolshevik Sue Lawley, when it was performed and by whom. He recalls how \"when living in a French villa by the sea in 1933\" they had \"the writer Andr\u00e9 Malraux\" drop in. Why not just Malraux or even Andr\u00e9? This is Hello! captioning, not fiction. These staged memories and forced flashbacks are the literary equivalent of the ripply TV screen: laughable, old-fashioned and unnecessary. And though she was clearly into colour, paint and sex, Frida Kahlo must have thought about other things now and then. Though it may not have been half so convenient for the novelist, it might have benefited the overall vivacity and credibility of the novel if, just for once, we'd seen the artist do something as simple as boil an egg without having to contemplate a) colour theory, b) Trotsky and world revolution or c) her place in history, while the rusty water bubbled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
