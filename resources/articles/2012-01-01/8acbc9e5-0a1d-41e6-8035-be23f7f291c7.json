Arsenal's spate of injuries has obliged Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to send out four centre-backs whose relative uniformity of size when strung in a defensive line has left them looking at times like table footballers \u2013 with the proviso that they lack the positional discipline compelled upon them by having a pole running through their ribs to link them together. Tony Pulis, who seems to have an aversion to orthodox full-backs, sent out Stoke City for their FA Cup third-round victory over Gillingham with the former England centre-halves Jonathan Woodgate and Matthew Upson at right- and left-back respectively. Indeed he has persevered with Woodgate in the old No2 role despite evidence that suggests the defender is wholly unsuited to the task. Although Woodgate's effort and commitment cannot be criticised, he does not have the mobility or mentality to cope with a winger attacking down the outside. Little wonder, then, given his years of experience in the middle, that he has not conquered his instinct to drift inside and seek the false security of a centre-back's support, leaving space for the opposition wide man to exploit. Without the pace and inclination to run beyond halfway with the ball, there is little, too, that he offers in attack. Even when Pulis has selected Ryan Shotton, a bona fide right-back, to cover Woodgate on the right side of midfield, Stoke have continued to look open there and opposition managers have targeted that flank as City's achilles heel. Woodgate tries his best but the sooner the manager recognises that the former Tottenham Hotspur centre-back is a fish out of water in that role the better for Stoke and the player's chances of ever re-establishing his credentials in the position in which clubs have paid over \u00a336m to deploy him. Pulis's policy has worked in the past and G\u00e9rard Houllier won a treble of League Cup, FA Cup and Uefa Cup for Liverpool in 2001 with a back four of Markus Babbel, St\u00e9phane Henchoz, Sami Hyypia and Jamie Carragher. More often, though, the qualities an out-and-out centre-half brings to the full-back position are outweighed by the flaws exposed when asked to fill a position out of step with his temperament and technique. In 1993, against Norway, Graham Taylor selected Gary Pallister as the left-sided of three central defenders to cope with the aerial threat of Jostein Flo. But England came under such sustained pressure that the left wing-back Lee Sharpe was forced to tuck into midfield, leaving Pallister operating as the left-back long enough to look hopelessly flat-footed in the role. There is nothing wrong with tall, powerful full-backs. You only have to look at the impact Micah Richards is making at Manchester City this season to understand the ideal managers are striving for when they attempt some alchemy to fill the position. Giacinto Facchetti, transformed from a centre-forward by Internazionale's manager Helenio Herrera, combined physical fortitude and aerial strength with a mastery of the left-back's arts. In the late 1970s and 80s West Germany's Hans-Peter Briegel cut a formidable figure, bullocking up the touchline. Born in the district of Kaiserslautern in the Rhineland, the six-footer's storming, ground-eating approach earned him the nickname Die Walz von der Pfalz, \"the Palatinate steamroller\". His performances at the 1982 World Cup, socks rolled down around his ankles in the style of QPR's Dave Thomas, and without the protection of shin-guards as if scorning opponents' capacity to hurt him, were, wrote the late Allen Wade, the Football Association's director of coaching from 1963-82, typical of the German full-back philosophy of weiter immer weiter, (forwards, always forwards). By the 1986 tournament he was playing at the heart of the defence and won his last cap in the final when his error in springing the offside trap let in Jorge Burruchaga to score Argentina's winning goal after his team-mates had pushed a boulder to the top of the hill to fight back from 2-0 down. Lapses in judgment occur all over the pitch but is easier to be more sympathetic when the culprit is playing in an unfamiliar position. One of the major problems when trying to convert a centre-back into a full-back is an understandable lack of confidence that leads to reticence when communicating with his fellow defenders. If you are preoccupied by your vulnerability it must be difficult to convey any authority. Not all conversions have such precarious consequences. Chris Smalling did a fine job for Manchester United last season filling in at right-back and Phil Jones, at times, has performed adequately. Both offer an attacking threat that is unusual among those whose education and character marks them out for careers in the centre. Branislav Ivanovic has also shown commendable versatility. Although he is not as comfortable as Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa at bombing forward, his presence always makes Chelsea look more composed at the back and less exposed. No one has done it better than France's Lilian Thuram, a centre-back of genuine pedigree for Parma and Juventus and a wonderfully proficient right-back for France, whose marauding runs and cool finishing in their 1998 World Cup semi-final against Croatia swung the tie in France's favour. Players with such adaptable gifts are rare, though. Without such valuable raw material to build on, managers are always going to struggle to strike gold. rob.bagchi@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
