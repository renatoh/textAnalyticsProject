Back in 1997 no one expected much of Clive Woodward's side against an All Black team which had cruised to a 25-8 victory in the first Test at Old Trafford. The upshot was a thrilling 26-26 draw which proved something special was finally stirring in the Rugby Football Union shrubbery. How English supporters would love history to be repeated tomorrow this afternoon. At first glance the omens are not great. A 42-6 defeat by the Springboks last week has slashed expectations to such an extent that a 20-point loss might be greeted with relief in the recession-hit corporate boxes where even the prawn sandwiches are now made with shrimps. The All Blacks, in contrast, are chasing a tour grand slam and have a hungry gleam in their eyes. Some reckon England's best chance is to stand motionless for so long after the haka that their visitors get fed up and go home. For players like Toby Flood, drafted in opposite the peerless Dan Carter, the memory of the summer tour to New Zealand scarcely encourages optimism. England conceded nine tries to their hosts in two Tests, with Carter contributing 39 of his side's 81 points. If that average is maintained, England will need to score over 40 points to win. Given they have scored only one try in their past two games, that appears improbable. Defeat for the All Blacks is about as likely as John Sergeant leading the haka. England, as a result, are as fired up as they have been all autumn. \"There's a definite sense that we've got to produce,\" growled Martin Johnson today yesterday, predicting England will perform better on the rebound tomorrowtoday. \"Lots of talk has gone on this week but it's about what we do on the field.\" A good start, fewer gift-wrapped presents and more dynamism at the breakdown are all non-negotiable, accompanied by a fierce desire to prove northern hemisphere rugby is not exclusively populated by dodos. \"We want to take the All Blacks somewhere they haven't been for quite a while,\" continued Johnson. \"You can have the best technique in the world but you need the right attitude as well. We want to put them under pressure in everything we do.\" This intensity will not, it seems, extend to any theatrical response to the haka, Johnson expressing the old-school opinion that the rugby matters rather more. \"There won't be any grand plan. We'll go out there, watch the haka and get on with the game. It's no good having a good haka performance if we're not focused on starting well.\" That may be easier said than done for Riki Flutey, the Maori in England's midfield who played for New Zealand in the junior World Cup in 1999 and counts Richie McCaw, Rodney So'oialo and Keven Mealamu among his contemporaries. If England really need their minds concentrated, they should listen to Phil Vickery, a long-suffering member of a pack which has to win the collisions if New Zealand are to be denied the momentum they feed off so expertly. Vickery believes young and old will have to pull together, irrespective of experience. \"It's all very well saying to guys, 'It won't always be like this,' because it'll get worse if we don't do something about it,\" cautioned the Wasps prop, among those convinced that the Springbok result was a touch misleading. \"Sometimes you lose games and think: 'Never in a month of Sundays would we have beaten them.' But while we didn't deserve to win last weekend, I didn't think the scoreline reflected what we could have done. Too much doom and gloom can be a bit of a noose around your neck.\" As, of course, can Carter and McCaw if they sense a hint of weakness or reticence. Carter will have noted the positional uncertainty among England's rearguard and the Kiwis will probe the 10-12 channel for holes whether Danny Cipriani is involved or not. Only if the Irish referee, Alain Rolland, has been listening to England's protestations about interpretations at the breakdown and opts to get tough with the scavenging McCaw will there be any prospect of a reprieve. More likely is a third comfortable away win in consecutive weeks. Either way Graham Henry reckons England will eventually come good under Johnson. \"I remember a young coach who came over to coach a team called Wales in 1998. In their first four games they lost three times. The coach received a letter from a guy quite highly placed in the Welsh game offering him a one-way first-class ticket back to New Zealand. He hung in there and won a few games after that. It might be a similar situation for Martin.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
