Roy Keane is carrying a niggle and on the bench for Manchester United, while Paul Scholes is out injured. As for Panathinaikos ... well, it's all Greek to me. Bad puns aside, they do have two familiar faces: Silvio Maric hardly set the world alight during an ill-fated 18-month stint with Newcastle, but former Burnley striker Dimitrios Papadopoulos looks more of a threat, having already struck three goals in the Greeks' three-match winning start to the domestic season. I haven't moved on and neither has ... ... Alison Jeeves, who is still managing the box office in the Carling Apollo at Hammersmith in London: \"Splendid to have the football commentary back online,\" she says. \"Can I place a bet on the following: how long into your commentary you make a comment about the Man United team that some of their followers find offensive, and then how many emails you get questioning your integrity/patriotism/parentage as a result of the aforementioned comment. My money is on the preamble.\" But how much of your money Alison? Unfortunately that paranoid London/New York/Hong Kong hardcore usually accuse me of bias at about 5pm, a couple of hours before I know what match I'm doing and sit down at the computer. 1 min: Manchester United kick-off playing from left to right and immediately win a throw deep in Panathinaikos territory. Quinton Fortune crosses to the far post where an unmarked Ruud van Nistelrooy plants an absolute sitter wide. A dreadful miss. 2 mins: From the edge of the centre-circle, Van Nistelrooy puts a pass along the deck into the Panathinaikos box into the path of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. It's cleared. 3 mins: Sanmartean punts a speculative ball into the Manchester United box and Nicky Butt handles it on the edge of the area. Maric appeals for a free-kick but the referee either didn't see it or was of the opinion that it was accidental. 4 mins: Gary Neville stretches and crosses low, hard and wide from a Nicky Butt pass into the box that was just too weighted. 6 mins: Giggs crosses in a free-kick from the left, but the ball is cleared and Papadopoulos beats Phil Neville to the ball. Considering the length of his name, I was rather hoping he would have a quiet evening at the office. 8 mins: Panathinaikos are managed by Izhak Shum. Which means that if anyone wants to speculate on what his team-talk will be about at half-time, they can send a mail with \"Shum might say ...\" in the subject bar. Do you see what I've done there? Do you? In the Panathinaikos goal, Nikopolidis makes heavy weather of a Phil Neville daisy-cutter. 12 mins: GOAL! Manchester United 1 - 0 Panthinaikos Giggs delivers a corner from the right, Van Nistelrooy acted as decoy and Silvestre poked it in from about two yards. Terrible defending by the Greeks. 13 mins: GOAL Manchester United 2 - 0 Panthinaikos \"Bagatelle football with the ball pinging about,\" says Big Ron on ITV1, which I must admit is a new one on me. Whatever Bagatelle football is, the ball eventually pings its way to Quinton Fortune who buries a left-footed drive from just inside the box. A great shot, swinging away from Nikopolidis and giving the goalkeeper very little chance. 14 mins: For Panathinaikos, Seitaridis crosses from the right and Howard dives low to collect. At the far end, Van Nistelrooy puts a brilliant cross-field pass into Giggs, but the Welshman's man-marker Goumas does well to concede a corner. Nowt comes of it except a free-out, after Van Nistelrooy jumps into Nikopolidis the goalkeeper. 21 mins: \"Here in New York we've been banking on your trenchant commentary to get us through a torpid afternoon,\" says Dan McSweeney. \"Now here we are at 2:33pm (7:33pm your time) and there is nary a sarcastic word to be seen. I will have to nip out for an ice cream soon to kill some time.\" Nikopolidis saves brilliantly, turning a Van Nistelrooy header from point-blank range around his post. The referee whistles for a goal-kick, which is rather baffling. Mine's a Wibbly Wobbly Wonder please Dan. 24 mins: Rory McPartland has mailed to tell me that I can cut and paste Papadopoulos's name, rather than type it out every time he gets the ball. That's all well and good Rory, but I still have to scroll down to the Panathinaikos line-up every time it goes near him. Meanwhile back at the ball-game, Konstantinou drifts off Rio Ferdinand's shoulder, gets on the end of a cross and brings an excellent save out of Tim Howard. Who'd have thunk it? Twenty-four minutes gone and not one juvenile Tourette's Syndrome gag at his expense yet. I'm very impressed with how much you've all matured in the close season. What? Oh. There's always one dept: John Thompson has mailed in to complain about the glacier-like speed of my updates. He knows they're slow, it says here, because he's watching the match on television as well. Honestly ... 32 mins GOAL! Manchester United 3 - 0 Panathinaikos: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gets a soft goal. Giggs crosses to him at the near post. Solskjaer shoots straight at Nikopolidis, who gets down low only to let the ball spin out of his grip and bobble over the line. A shocking mistake for the Greek national goalkeeper. 35 mins: \"Re: 'Mine's a Wibbly Wobbly Wonder'\" writes Stephen Turner, teeing up what I fear could be the most predicatble pay-off to a gaga of all time. \"Barry, we don't need to read descriptions of your anatomy - could you just concentrate on the football?\" A big cymbal crash to you too Stephen Turner. Who I presume is the same Stephen Turner I once saw in a studenty Shakespeare production, wearing a gimp costume while poncing around on roller-blades. You can't bottle class like that. 39 mins: GOAL: Manchester United 4 - 0 Panthinaikos After great play on the left from Giggs and John O'Shea, Nicky Butt creeps into the box and heads it home. The Manchester United fans strike up a chorus of \"Are you City in disguise?\". Meanwhile the travelling Greek fans look as disconsolate as you'd expect for men who travelled a long way at great expense to watch their team get whipped. Elsewhere in Europe after 44 minutes: Rangers 0 - 0 Stuttgart Real Madrid 2 - 1 Marseille Sparta Prague 0 - 0 Chelsea Solskjaer, who appears to have picked up a knock, is replaced by David Bellion, the French whelp United poached from Sunderland. Half-time Terrible news from Castle Greyskull: Rangers 0 - 1 Stuttgart. There's always one II: \"Clearly minute-by-minute commentary, as advertised at the top of the page, is rather misleading isn't it blah-de-blah, whinge, moan, boo hoo etc.\" types David M, who should realise that nobody likes a pedant. Rest assured that's the last one of those nit-picky emails I'll be giving the time of day to this season. Half-time entertainment (well, that's one word for it) \"Good to have you back!\" writes Alan Kirkup from Arkansas before complaining about our lack of auto-refresh and enquiring about the whereabouts of the Razorback t-shirt he sent to the Fiverathon. Believe it or not Alan, that particular item of apparel actually ended up being sported by a lady in the bedroom of someone who works on this site. 46 mins: Chalkias replaces the fairly abject Nikopolidis in the Panathinaikos goal. The only mathematics celebrity of Guardian Unlimited's acquaintance, Phelim Boyle from Northern Ireland, if I remember correctly, has mailed in to confirm he is still alive and doing hard sums. He tells me his \"wonderful wife\" is a Fulham fan, bless. Then complains that we're not doing the Chelsea match and suggests Tyrone will beat Armagh in the All Ireland Pulling And Dragging Final. (Also known as Gaelic Football). 48 mins: A very fancy Manchester United move breaks down after a mix-up between Giggs and Silvestre. Not very interesting, I know, but the lord knows I have to type something. 51 mins: Manchester United win a free half-way inside the Panathinaikos half. It's cleared by ... a Greek defender and I suddenly realise that I forgot to write their shirt-numbers beside their names before the game started. Schoolboy error there, with me showing some classic Champions League inexperience. 53 mins: Panathinaikos almost score when Seitaridis whips a cross in towards Konstantinou, who gets a shot on target. Tim Howard saves. The same Tim Howard who is not unlike \"TIMMY!!!\" from South Park, according to Simon Barlow. John O'Shea and Nicky Butt are replaced by Eric Djemba-Djemba (so good they named him twice) and Darren Fletcher. 58 mins: This match is just dying a slow death. Panathinaikos haven't given up completely, but I would be prepared to go out on a limb here and state that Manchester United will take all three points. Alison Jeeves may take me up on a wager, as she's mailed in to say the currency for her last bet was going to be Lord Of The Dance tickets. Go Flatley! 60 mins: The debate over cutting and pasting Papadopoulos contines. \"You don't have to scroll down every time,\" explains Paul F. Seils, with more than a hint of condescension. \"Just copy and paste it once and every time therafter strike 'control v'. As if by magic, it will appear.\" That's fine Paul. And if I need to start typing equally unwieldy sobriquets such as Sanmartean, Konstantinou, Kyrgiakos, Seitaridis or Zutautas on a regular basis? Anyway, it's all irrelevant now as Papadopoulos makes way for Olisadebe. This match has now officially descended into what this minute-by-minute report has been from the get-go: disjointed farce. 65 mins: Manchester United win a corner which Giggs swings in from the right. Chalkias punches clear. Darren Fletcher puts the ball back in towards Giggs but there's too much weight on his pass and it goes wide. Now here's a man with problems and an impressive list of letters after his email signature, it must be said: \"My only complaint is that I have to keep switching to the Sky Sports site to get an update of Southend United's match against Lincoln (we're losing 0-1 in case you're interested),\" writes Paul A McKenzie MSc CPhys MInstP. I feel your pain Paul. My lot are getting mauled 3-1 by Stoke. 70 mins: Panathinaikos win a free-kick in their own penalty area. I have absolutely no idea why and to be perfectrly honest, I don't really give a monkey's. Real Madrid are beating Marseille 4-1, if anyone's interested. 72 mins: With his back to goal, Konstantinou attempts to feed one of his wingers but the ball is cut out by a Manchester United defender. A brilliant cross-field pass finds its way to Giggs, who controls the ball well and shoots left to right across the face of the Panathinaikos goal and wide. 75 mins: The young whelps brought on by Sir Alex Ferguson are starting to bed in a bit, find their feet and showboat a little. Djemba-Djemba and Fletcher are looking particularly industrious. Izhak Shum the Panathinaikos manager looks at his watch and yawns. I know exactly how he feels. 78 mins: The Manchester United fans are making quite a bit of noise, you can't help but feel that these players are so far removed from reality it's like cheering on Ben Affleck while he does that poncy Head &amp; Shoulders advert. \"This work is dangerous. FOR MY HAIR!\" 80 mins GOAL! Manchester United 5 - 0 Panthinaikos Eric Djemba-Djemba buries his first goal for United into the roof of the Panathinaikos net. Meanwhile in Castle Greyskull, Rangers have gone 2-1 up against Stuttgart and Chelsea are 1-0 up against Sparta Prague. 87 mins: Sorry, I nodded off there for a while. 88 mins: Number of people who appear to think I'm at the match: 3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
