Following estimates from a leading employers\u2019 organisation that at least a third of workers in the private sector were likely to be furloughed, the Resolution Foundation said it had upped its estimate of the bill the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, would face. Sunak has announced that the state will pay up to 80% of the wages of workers sent home by their companies because they have nothing to do during the period while large chunks of the economy are at a standstill. In its latest weekly update the British Chambers of Commerce said 20% of companies that had responded to its survey were planning to furlough all their staff and two-thirds said they would furlough 75-100% of their workforce in the coming week. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cFaced with an unprecedented economic crisis, the chancellor has set out a bold and ambitious job retention scheme to limit job losses, and help firms recover as quickly as possible once the pandemic is over. \u201cBy subsidising up to 80% of workers\u2019 wages, the scheme will also help millions of workers who would otherwise face catastrophic hits to their living standards.\u201d The Treasury is working on plans for how the UK might come out of the lockdown imposed in the middle of last month, but any strategy will involve a gradual opening up of the economy to minimise the impact of reinfection. According to the Resolution Foundation\u2019s estimates, the cost of the furlough scheme could amount to 2% of national income \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 per quarter, and on current trends it appears likely that financial help for some sectors of the economy will last for at least six months. Bell said: \u201cThe cost of the scheme depends on firms\u2019 take-up and the length of time workers need to be furloughed for. But with recent surveys implying that at least a third of the private sector workforce could be paid through the scheme, it is likely to cost as much as \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn over three months. \u201cThe economic and social cost of mass unemployment in the absence of such a scheme would be far, far greater.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
