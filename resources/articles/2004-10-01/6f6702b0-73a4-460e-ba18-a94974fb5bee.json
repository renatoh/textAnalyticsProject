And then I thought, \"Good. Let's have him as prime minister.\" For aren't you sick of leadership? In the American presidential election, they talk of little else. All the arguments are about whether John Kerry or George Bush is the stronger, bolder, more decisive leader. But why is everyone so eager to be led? In Britain, we have had two prime ministers since Winston Churchill who have fancied themselves as leaders: Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. They have done some good things, both of them, but at a heavy price to our tranquillity and contentment. Both have continually paraded before us their leadership qualities and their \"convictions\", causing us much mental and emotional fatigue. I am still not at all clear what Tony Blair's convictions are, but the important thing is that he knows he has them and wants us to admire him for having them. Without either of these leaders, we would have been at war much less often than we have been, and under Blair in particular there has been spectacular loss of life among not merely humans, such as Iraqis, but also among animals - mainly cows. And soon, after the passage of the bill to ban foxhunting, there will be a massacre of foxhounds. In fact, the only creature Blair seems particularly eager to save is the fox, which is a savage animal that enjoys killing for killing's sake - that kills 10 chickens just for the fun of it when one would suffice to satisfy its hunger. Even rats are of a more amiable disposition. I admired Mrs Thatcher for some things she did, and I still think she was one of the great comic figures of the century, whom we should cherish for that if for nothing else. But I remember the great relief I felt when she was succeeded by grey, modest John Major, however inadequate a prime minister he turned out to be. We would no longer be hectored or harangued. We would no longer be exalted and uplifted. We would be allowed to get on quietly with our lives while Mr Major did the housekeeping. He may not have been a very good housekeeper, but that is by the way. Sometimes a leader is needed, principally in time of war. But it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs if we have to invent wars in order to satisfy some prime minister's craving to lead. The happiest times are those in which we can potter along calmly together, enjoying ourselves as best we can, without crises or dramas. The prime ministers that best suit the British temperament are those who share this belief and try to soothe us when we are anxious rather than get us even more wound up. Harold Macmillan and Jim Callaghan were both good at this. Well into Macmillan's premiership, there was an opinion poll showing that a vast percentage of the population had no idea who he was. This was generally greeted with dismay, as a sign of a democracy in trouble. But I thought it showed that things were working rather well. Unfortunately, there is nobody today who hasn't heard of Tony Blair. We used to despise Italy for its rotating coalition governments and constantly changing, weak prime ministers whose names nobody could remember. There was little to admire in the way Italy was governed, but it didn't seem to matter terribly. The country has steadily grown in prosperity and contentment. Now it has a \"leader\" in the preposterous figure of Silvio Berlusconi, it is much more jittery. As soon as I finish this, I will be flying off to New York where I will doubtless witness the babyish competition between the rival candidates to show who is the most patriotic and who possesses the finest leadership qualities. It would be nice to think that in Britain we are more grown-up than the Americans, that we take every politician's patriotism for granted and don't yearn to be led. It would be even nicer to think that we support our civilised system of parliamentary democracy and cabinet government that is designed to keep a prime minister in his place. If this is really how we are, and we don't want to go any further down the American route, the best way for us to show it is to go out at the next general election and vote for Charles Kennedy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
