Nest (National Employment Savings Trust), a publicly-owned scheme set up by the government, says stricter worldwide regulation, increasingly aggressive legal action by governments against the tobacco industry and falling global smoking rates have all led it to conclude that tobacco is a poor investment for its members. Nest will be going tobacco-free across its entire portfolio - both passive and active funds \u2013 though it estimates it will take up to two years for this to fully happen. The \u00a36bn scheme\u2019s exposure to tobacco is currently put at around \u00a340m and includes holdings in British American Tobacco (whose brands include Dunhill and Rothmans) and Philip Morris, the company behind Marlboro. Nest was set up by the government to help employers meet their obligations under the \u201cautomatic enrolment\u201d retirement saving initiative, which went live in 2012. Currently, one in four UK workers have an account with Nest. Nest says it has not taken this decision lightly, \u201cbut we don\u2019t think it makes sense to continue investing in an industry whose business model looks increasingly unsustainable\u201d. It already has a tobacco-free policy on a couple of its funds. Commenting on the announcement, Dean Walker, a scheme member based in Portsmouth, says: \u201cI\u2019m a new dad and I\u2019ll certainly be encouraging my daughter not to smoke when she grows up. Everyone knows it\u2019s not good for you and can cause cancers, which I feel very strongly against. \u201cI think what Nest are doing is a great idea and I hope more companies follow suit.\u201d In 2017 it emerged that Nest was shifting a chunk of its investments into a new climate change fund designed to move people\u2019s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy. It said it wanted to protect members from the risks associated with the climate emergency by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas. It is predicted that by the late 2020s, one-third of the UK working population will have a pension pot with Nest. The average income of a member is around \u00a318,000 a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
