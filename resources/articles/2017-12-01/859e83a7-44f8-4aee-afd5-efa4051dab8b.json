Tuilagi pleaded not guilty at his hearing on Wednesday with the disciplinary panel ruling that while the tackle on Munster\u2019s Chris Cloete was reckless it did not warrant a red card. It was the 26-year-old centre\u2019s first match since the opening day of the season, having undergone knee surgery, and means he is available for Leicester\u2019s Christmas Eve match against Saracens. It also boosts his chances of stringing together a run of games before Eddie Jones names his England squad for the Six Nations. While O\u2019Connor was satisfied Tuilagi had been cleared, he pointed to the disruption the disciplinary process had caused. In October the England captain Dylan Hartley\u2019s involvement during the autumn internationals was placed in jeopardy after he was cited for striking the head of Clermont\u2019s Rabah Slimani. That was also dismissed and Northampton swiftly issued a statement with the now former director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, saying: \u201cCitings like this do beg the question of whether Dylan is being singled out for what has happened in the past rather than being judged solely on [the] game.\u201d O\u2019Connor said he does not believe Tuilagi had been singled out because of his Pacific Islands heritage but he was similarly critical of the disciplinary process. \u201cEveryone involved in the game has to be a little bit more accountable for the actions they take,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players and the coaches are certainly accountable and we\u2019d just like the rest of rugby to be just as accountable, the citing commissioners. \u201cIt\u2019s caused unnecessary disruption. It\u2019s what it does to Manu in the state that he\u2019s in. He comes back and plays the game physically and legally. Unfortunately, it just makes everyone a bit unnecessarily cautious about the physicality and collisions. The citing commissioners need to be a little bit more accurate with what they\u2019re sanctioning and what they\u2019re not.\u201d Tuilagi\u2019s former British &amp; Irish Lions team-mate Brian O\u2019Driscoll insisted the \u201cgame has gone soft\u201d in response to the citing on Tuesday and O\u2019Connor insisted that the tackle was legal. \u201cHe won\u2019t miss any rugby so that\u2019s incredibly pleasing,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThe sanction has to be a red-card offence and from our perspective there was no red-card offence. There was no malice, there was no intent to hurt the bloke. It was a very legitimate tackle. It\u2019s a reaction to the broader community around health and safety and player welfare.\u201d Tuilagi has managed only 17 minutes of game time for England under Jones and last started a Test in June 2014 because of his long list of injury problems. He made only seven Leicester appearances last term but, after coming through 80 minutes against Munster, O\u2019Connor was optimistic of swift improvements. \u201cHe\u2019ll get better and better every time he plays,\u201d O\u2019Connor said on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll be very diligent about what we have to do but the growth that he\u2019ll get out of that mentally and physically will be enormous for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
