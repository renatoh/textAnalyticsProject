Rayner, 70, had the double mastectomy on Saturday after discovering a lump in her breast while on holiday. But she had no plans to take it easy. Yesterday Rayner, a tireless campaigner on public health issues, used the press interest in her illness to attack on the main political parties for failing to campaign on the issue of care for pensioners. In a statement, Rayner said she had been disappointed to come round from her operation and read yesterday's newspapers. \"At first I thought I was just drunk on anaesthetic. Then I realised my head really was clear enough: not a damn word had been said by anybody about personal care for the elderly.\" Rayner was a member of the royal commission set up by the government that recommended the costs of pensioners' non-medical care should be met by the state. \"It's all very well for Tony Blair to beat his chest over the 75p pensions increase and admit it was a mistake,\" she said. \"But if he really wants older people to think he means business, he should promise to institute the findings of the commission which he was responsible for creating.\" Before the operation Rayner, who is patron of the Pink Ribbon magazine, which raises funds to fight breast cancer, issued a statement saying she had been determined to go public with her illness. She said: \"If we don't talk about it openly we can never hope to secure the proper treatment that the thousands of women diagnosed with breast cancer in this country every year deserve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
