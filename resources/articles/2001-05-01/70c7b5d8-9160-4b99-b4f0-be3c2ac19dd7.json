Vilified by many, admired by a few, Sampson played an instrumental role in the three great upheavals to shake the island in his lifetime. As a gunman in the 1955-59 struggle of Eoka (the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters) against British colonial rule, he twice faced the death sentence as \"the executioner of Murder Mile\", the name given to the Nicosia street where more than a dozen British servicemen and civilians were killed during the troubles. To Turkish Cypriots, Sampson was \"the most hated Greek Cypriot\", an infamous militia leader accused of atrocities during the 1964 post-independence fighting that tore the two communities apart. Had the British hanged him, Sampson would undoubtedly have been a hero to his Greek Cypriot compatriots. But his role in the 1974 coup that sparked the Turkish invasion and led to the partition of Cyprus marked him out as a traitor to all but an extreme rightwing fringe, ensuring that he would be remembered as the \"eight-day president\" - the man who accepted the poisoned chalice offered by the Greek junta after its violent overthrow of President Archbishop Makarios. Sampson was born Nicos Georgiades in Nicosia. He began work as a Times of Cyprus photojournalist in 1956, changing his surname to mark him out from countless namesakes. But as Eoka's struggle for enosis - union with Greece - accelerated, it became clear that the photographer, so often first to a story, was deeply involved in the violence against British rule. In January 1957, he was arrested and confessed to the murder of two policemen - a crime that carried the death sentence. But at his trial he retracted his confession, claiming he had been mistreated in police custody, a view shared by the judge, who acquitted him. He was soon rearrested, and this time sentenced to death for possession of a gun. Again, Sampson survived: the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he was sent to Britain to serve out his term. When Cyprus gained independence in 1960, he returned to a hero's welcome. But for him and many others the battle was not over. They had fought for enosis and, instead, been granted an unworkable independence hedged with guarantees for the Turkish Cypriot minority. Sampson immediately launched a newspaper, Machi (the Battle), from whose pages he continued his strident campaign, while boasting that he had, indeed, killed the two British policemen of whose murder he had been acquitted, and many others besides. But his struggle was not limited to words. When fighting broke out, with the collapse of the constitution in 1963-64, Sampson led a militia force into the Nicosia suburb of Omorphita. To the Greek Cypriots trapped there he was a saviour, but he struck terror into the hearts of their Turkish Cypriot neighbours, leaving devastation in his wake. President Makarios was later to claim that, in 1964, Brigadier Demetrios Ioannides, subsequently head of the infamous Greek junta, accompanied by Sampson, came to him with a plan to \"eliminate\" the Turkish Cypriots as a definitive solution to the Cyprus problem. Horrified, Makarios sent them away. But Sampson and the colonels who took power in Greece in 1967 increasingly saw the archbishop as betraying the cause of enosis. Yet, despite the meeting of minds and brutal credentials that endeared him to the junta, Sampson was not the colonels' first choice when their conspiracies finally led to Makarios's overthrow on July 15 1974. That morning, the coup's instigators vainly knocked on doors looking for a president, and only turned to Sampson as a last resort. Despite his election to parliament in 1970, Sampson was a man of action rather than a politician, and one hardly likely to endear the new regime either to the Turks or the international community. The Turks duly invaded five days later; the Greek junta - and with them Sampson - fell three days after that. In 1977, Sampson was convicted of usurping the presidency, and jailed for 20 years. In the public eye, he came to represent the coup and its consequences, seen as the man whose actions had given Turkey the opportunity to invade. He always denied involvement in the instigation of the coup, claiming that as its figurehead he had been punished as a scapegoat. Two years after his conviction, he was allowed to travel to France for medical reasons, and stayed there in exile until 1990. He went back to prison on his return to Cyprus, but the sentence was suspended on health grounds a few months later. Thereafter, he devoted himself to his newspaper, building a reputation for lurid conspiracy stories and vitriolic anti-Turkish and anti-British rhetoric. Sampson was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. He is survived by his wife, Vera, and two children. \u0095 Nicos Sampson, publisher and politician, born December 16 1935; died May 9 2001"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
