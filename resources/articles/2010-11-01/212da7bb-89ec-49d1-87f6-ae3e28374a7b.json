Assessing Bush's book Decision Points in today's Guardian Review, the former Labour spin maestro upbraids Bush's critics for their \"avalanche of vitriol\", writing \"you don't get to be US president \u2013 twice \u2013 by being stupid\". Campbell also finds in the book a convincing account of Bush's 2003 decision to invade Iraq: \"You would be hard pressed, on a fair reading, to say the chapters on Iraq show a 'rush to war'.\" Instead, Campbell argues, Bush was an unusually plain-speaking politician who is revealed to be \"more reflective and self-analytical than the public image suggests\". Campbell served as Tony Blair's director of communications during the invasion of Iraq, and says Decision Points confirms his view of the White House's attitude during the prewar period: \"I do not buy the idea that he was hellbent on war in Iraq \u2013 also confirmed by the book, and in particular by the letters to his father and daughters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
