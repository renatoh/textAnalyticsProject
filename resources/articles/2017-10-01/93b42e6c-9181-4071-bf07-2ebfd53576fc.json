He\u2019s now back out the other side, making his traditional \u201cspace disco\u201d, but with some beautiful acid-flashback flourishes. Spire and Tensions evoke cocktail hour at an Ibizan villa, before But Isn\u2019t It and Shinin nicely showcase house and Italo songcraft. All pleasant enough, but Lindstr\u00f8m then levels up in the final third, with Drift, a hail of petals that recalls Orbital\u2019s Belfast, and the jazz piano that poignantly destabilises closing tracks Bungl (Like a Ghost) and Under Trees. The former is also invigorated by stark poetry and black-feathery cooing from Jenny Hval, a gothic phantom haunting the club with a gravestone on her back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
