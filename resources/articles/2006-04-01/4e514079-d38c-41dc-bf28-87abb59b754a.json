Varney hopes Curbishley will stay at The Valley but said it was important to plan for the possibility of life without him. \"We have to look out for the future of Charlton,\" he told BBC Radio London. \"With the length of time the whole process is taking, we've taken steps to make sure we know which direction we want to go in if Alan Curbishley is the actual choice at the end of the day. \"We want Alan to stay but we are thinking about the possibility of losing him. Alan tactically is a very good coach and it is not easy to do that year-on-year for 15 years. We can see why he is a candidate but it is unrealistic to think we are not making plans to make sure if that's what happens, we move on, get the person who fits our profile and continue to develop Charlton.\" Curbishley is on the shortlist to succeed Eriksson, and Varney believes the front-runners managing in the Premiership have been put in \"an incredibly difficult position\", with their results scrutinised more than ever and subject to constant questioning over developments. Charlton play an FA Cup quarter-final replay tonight at Middlesbrough, whose manager Steve McClaren is another strong candidate for England. Curbishley will delay until the summer any talks with Charlton about extending his contract and is undecided about whether he would commit to a longer stay. He rejected suggestions that he is seriously considering leaving whatever happens. \"I don't know about going,\" he said. \"I've got one year left and I think people forgot about that. It's just a question of do I extend it. I have a lot of thinking to do, because if I extend it takes me into 20 years at the club and I hit the 50 mark.\" Curbishley feels Darren Bent is capable of sending Charlton into the semi-finals tonight. The 22-year-old needs to end the campaign fit and in persuasive form to try to earn a place in England's World Cup squad, and has scored three times against Middlesbrough this season. Charlton have been suffering from a recent goal drought, with the team finding the net in only two of their past nine matches, but Curbishley described Bent as \"a great finisher\" and added: \"If you look at the goals they are not all in the same group. They are right foot, left foot, headers.\" Six of Charlton's past nine matches have ended goalless but Curbishley said he had needed to make his team harder to beat. \"It's alright sitting up in that stand saying: 'Entertain me'\" he said. \"We were regularly getting beaten by three goals and that was not entertaining me and I needed to do something about it.\" TV: BBC1, 8.05pm kick off"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
