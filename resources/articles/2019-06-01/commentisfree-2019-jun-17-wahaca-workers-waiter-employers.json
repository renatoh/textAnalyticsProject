Some diners had done a runner; another, law-abiding punter, Sarah Hayward, overheard the ensuing row and took to Twitter to complain: \u201cPpl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages. Apparently company policy. Utterly shameful employment practice.\u201d After some social media to-ing and fro-ing, it turned out the server had been docked \u00a33 on the \u00a340 bill, then reimbursed as it did not amount to \u201cgross negligence\u201d. The company\u2019s founder, Thomasina Miers, concluded: \u201cIt is a crazy world where one is hung before even being asked a question \u2026 it really saddens me that people are so quick to presume the worst.\u201d It is a bruising experience to be monstered on Twitter; and most people who saw the fight kick off will not hang around to watch its resolution. That\u2019s half the point of the site, the social media director of a fashion brand once explained to me, people buy your stuff on Instagram, talk about it on Facebook and complain on Twitter. Wahaca\u2019s policy, though, is muddy. The staff handbook states: \u201cIf through your negligence a customer leaves the restaurant without paying you will be liable to pay the full bill including service to the company or it will be deducted from your wages.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine what negligence could possibly make it the waiter\u2019s fault that a customer commits an act of theft. Might they collude with the diner in a complicated scam, someone suggested? Hard to see the profit of such an enterprise when someone other than the waiter has already eaten it. But the killer detail is \u201cincluding service\u201d; if someone steals a sum from this restaurant that includes an amount specifically meant for the waiter, the waiter still has to reimburse the restaurant. There is no decent response to that beyond: \u201cYou what?\u201d It is impossible to imagine such a policy \u2013 which is by no means confined to Wahaca \u2013 surviving a robust and equitable negotiation between employer and employee. Odd details about workplaces frequently fire up the bystander\u2019s imagination. When an Amazon employee has to wear a tag to monitor their pace, or an AA call centre (going back 15 years) times its workers\u2019 loo breaks, there is this collective, audible unease about what it means. You can see any number of statistics about the division of profit between capital and labour, you can familiarise yourself very well with the extent and reality of the zero-hours contract, but nothing reaches that particular bit of your brain circuitry \u2013 let\u2019s call it the perception of justice \u2013 quite like a simple, even mundane, human interaction in which one side holds all the cards. Whether it\u2019s hyper-surveillance in the workplace or financial penalties for circumstances beyond your control, these measures speak of a relationship in which the parties are not equal. We\u2019re right to feel disquieted. The presumption of parity \u2013 the worker\u2019s time being of comparable value to the employer\u2019s pay, and their voices and interests being, if not always perfectly aligned, at least of equal importance \u2013 is the fundamental principle of dignity at work. This is what unions established; and everything that makes gainful employment bearable \u2013 from weekends to sick pay \u2013 spiralled from it. Whenever we hear a story of the workplace that doesn\u2019t sound fair, the thought should end: \u201cThat person should join a union.\u201d Some years ago, Neil Foster, now at the GMB and one of the most inspiring thinkers of the modern trade union movement, had an idea to reinvigorate it. All the large sectoral unions were seeing declining numbers and low engagement; but more to the point, the rise of insecurity at work was having a corrosive effect on union influence. Employees who didn\u2019t know how many shifts they would get from one week to the next simply couldn\u2019t afford the jeopardy of picking a fight. Foster\u2019s idea was a broad-based online union not limited to any particular sector, which anyone could join. It would have the institutional knowledge and skills of a traditional union, but the ease of use and prospect of mass mobilisation you find in modern online campaigning organisations like Avaaz and 38 Degrees. Collective demands could be made that didn\u2019t hang on individual workers whose positions were precarious. While that has yet to happen, there is significant creativity in this field: university lecturers have started pop-up unions to fight on single issues. Unite set up a community union for the unemployed and low-paid to fight the bedroom tax. The GMB, defending three groundsmen who were fired from Brighton football club this month, had a surge of solidarity support. Today everyone from Marxists to Rory Stewart seems broadly to agree that a new world is struggling to be born. These spontaneous explosions at injustice on Twitter suggest something a little more specific and practical is waiting to find its voice: a mass movement, similar in scope and ambition to the earliest days of unionisation, with the wholly new tools of the connected workforce. Online outrage is edging towards online solidarity. Less an echo chamber, more a muster point. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
