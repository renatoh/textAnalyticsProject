General Motors and Ford shares both rose more than 25% in midday trading after senators from auto-producing US states offered a pact to accelerate $25bn (\u00a316.6bn) in loans to the two companies, as well as to the privately held Chrysler. But Democratic party leaders said that the compromise did not have enough support to pass. Instead, they offered to give the \"big three\" of Detroit a second chance to argue why the United States should spend public money to pull them back from the brink of bankruptcy. Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, told reporters: \"The executives of the auto companies have not been able to convince Congress and the American people that this bail-out would be their last.\" Reid said the \"unfortunate reality\" was that the compromise, which would redirect $25bn in money approved last month to help the automakers turn out more fuel-efficient cars, could not win a majority in Congress. The other option, a Democratic push to spend part of the Bush administration's $700bn banking bail-out on the car companies, has been strongly opposed by the White House. GM, Ford, and Chrysler are expected to submit their detailed bail-out pitch by December 2, giving Congress time for hearings the following week and a possible vote before Christmas. GM and Chrysler have warned they may run perilously short of cash by the year's end. The rethink over the car bail-out reflects widespread consternation over the public performance of the three chief executives of the car companies, who blamed their predicament entirely on the global credit crisis and took no responsibility for their firms' being near to insolvency. The three chief executives also flew separate private jets to Washington to testify this week, sparking popular anger over such perks while the companies seek government aid. Nancy Pelosi, the House of Representatives speaker, told reporters: \"I don't think we saw too much in the hearings over the past couple of days that gave us ... confidence.\" Pelosi had ruled out the terms of the compromise offered earlier today, deeming a plan to divert the $25bn clean-vehicles fund \"a step backward in assuring the viability and competitiveness of the US auto industry\". Asked how Democrats would find the money to save Detroit if the carmakers submit workable rescue plans next month, Pelosi insisted: \"We're not talking today about what money would be used, we're talking about the need for accountability and viability.\" The shock announcement of a bail-out deadline came after a bleak week for GM, Ford, and Chrysler. After their pleas met with chilly scepticism in the Capitol, their staunchest defender, congressman John Dingell of Michigan, lost his leadership of the House energy and commerce committee. Motor industry stocks fell early today after Dingell's dethroning before jumping higher on news of the possible bail-out and falling again following the deadline announcement. Meanwhile, GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors, took a step towards winning a share of the $700bn financial bail-out by applying to become a bank holding company. GMAC is majority owned by Cerberus Capital Management, the private-equity fund that also controls Chrysler. Chrysler may still be eyeing a possible merger with GM if the industry wins its bail-out push this year. US unemployment claims rose last week to 542,000, their highest level in 16 years, which could help pave the way to a quick auto industry bail-out next month amid fears of an economic knock-on effect if one of the three carmakers were to declare bankruptcy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
