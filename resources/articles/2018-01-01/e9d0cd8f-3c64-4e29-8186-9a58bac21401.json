United produced a dominant second-half display at Goodison Park to record their first victory in five matches thanks to superb goals from Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard. The visitors were inspired by Pogba, who was heavily criticised by Scholes following Saturday\u2019s goalless draw at home to Southampton, and Mourinho took the opportunity to return fire. He claimed several former United players turned pundits were driven in their criticism by an unfulfilled desire to have a job back at Old Trafford. And he reserved his fiercest condemnation for Scholes. \u201cMaybe I will be lucky this time and the kings of rock and roll who said I was under-performing last match will now say I\u2019m performing,\u201d the United manager said. Turning specifically to Scholes\u2019 criticism of Pogba, Mourinho added: \u201cI think the only thing Paul Scholes does is criticise. I don\u2019t think he comments, I think he criticises, which is a different thing. Not every one of us has to be phenomenal like he was as a player. That does not mean we all have to be phenomenal. \u201cPaul [Pogba] tries to do his best all the time. Sometimes he plays very well, sometimes he plays well, sometimes he doesn\u2019t play so well. It\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that he has made much more money than Paul Scholes. It\u2019s not Paul Scholes\u2019 fault either, it\u2019s just the way football is. I think Scholes will be in history as a phenomenal player, not as a pundit. I prefer to look at him as a phenomenal player that gave so much to the club that I am proud to represent. \u201cIf Paul one day decides to be a manager, I wish that he can be 25% as successful as myself. 50% of that is 12.5 silverware, 25% is around 6. If he\u2019s 25%, he\u2019ll be quite happy. In my mind Paul Scholes is a phenomenal player, one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen playing in midfield. He gave so much to my club that I can only thank him for that. The prestige of this club is based on people like him.\u201d Mourinho also suggested that several former United players have an agenda against his team as they long for a return to the club, something he is not prepared to accommodate. \u201cI think they would love to be here,\u201d he said of the many former United players in the media. \u201cThey would love to be at the club and that\u2019s a problem I cannot resolve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
