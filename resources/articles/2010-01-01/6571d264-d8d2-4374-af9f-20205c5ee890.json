On the field, they are struggling to cling on to their 1-0 series lead over South Africa. At 48 for three, they are 195 runs behind, with two days remaining to save the fourth and final Test, after once more suffering at the hands of the controversial third umpire Daryl Harper. Off the field, a bizarre appeal by the England and Wales Cricket Board to have a referral reinstated following the Graeme Smith controversy on Friday evening was ignored by the International Cricket Council until it was too late, though the world governing body did promise a \"full and comprehensive\" investigation into England's grievances. Giles Clarke, the chairman of the ECB, laid into the review system, describing it as \"damned dangerous\" and its implementation as \"a shambles\". The decision review system dominated the third day just as it had the second with England once again on the rough end of it, three times in the case of AB de Villiers, as South Africa piled up 423 for seven declared to lead by 243. De Villiers was twice reprieved by the system after umpire Tony Hill had given him out caught at leg-slip on 11 and lbw playing no shot on 24. On the first occasion the ambivalent TV pictures did not appear to give Harper sufficient grounds to overturn Hill's original decision. But England's biggest frustration with the batsman came when he had scored 41. He was given not out even though replays showed he had clearly edged a Ryan Sidebottom delivery. England had already used up their referrals. It was all too much for Clarke, who talked about his frustrations with the system even though there was a danger his comments might be interpreted as sour grapes after the system had saved England from almost certain defeat in Cape Town by (correctly) reprieving Paul Collingwood. A grumpy looking Clarke said: \"The technology wasn't applied as it was meant to be in the pre-series discussions. We were told the volume [for the third umpire's TV replays] would be turned up. Consequently we lost a referral and our other play is impacted by having one less. It's thoroughly unsatisfactory and I'm not happy. \"We are better off with the old system. If the umpire is as deaf as a post and as blind as a bat at least it's the same for both sides. We have to realise that we have created, in rather a hurry, a system which attacks one of the basic principles of the game \u2013 and it is a damned dangerous thing.\" \"What are we going to see in recreational games, and games where referrals are not available, and we have consistently seen people questioning umpires' decisions?\" England voted against the new system before it was implemented but were defeated 9-1. At least England were promised an investigation by the ICC, though it is unlikely to change anything. \"We have received a letter of complaint from the ECB and we will launch a formal investigation into the exact circumstances surrounding the application of the decision review system after completion of the Johannesburg Test match,\" said the ICC chief executive, Haroon Lorgat. \"There is a large amount of controversy, speculation and potentially unfair criticism circulating at present so it is important to establish the exact facts before reaching any final conclusions.\" The day started, as the previous one had ended, with Harper the main talking point. The Australian appeared to tell Facebook friends that he had been made a \"scapegoat\" for the incompetence of others. Later, though, he denied that the comments attributed to him on the social networking site had been his own. The problem for Harper is that he has so undermined his credibility with a series of gaffes that players find it difficult to have confidence in him. In the last Test, at Newlands, his extraordinary decision to give Ashwell Prince out, even though the batsman had got nowhre near the ball, at least gave DRS the vindication it needed. He was also the third umpire when England were in the Caribbean last winter where there were problems in Jamaica when he complained that he was not given the right pictures and again in Barbados after he refused to overturn a blatantly awful decision against Darrren Powell. England's position looks hopeless, and Mark Boucher, who scored 95 off 118 balls to become the second specialist wicketkeeper after Adam Gilchrist to score 5,000 Test runs, said: \"We've had England under pressure for five to six days of Test cricket now and after a while that pressure does tell. Things have gone for us in this game but you make your own luck and here we have been the side that wanted it more.\" In contrast, Sidebottom looked glum when he admitted that recent decisions had got to the players. \"We're all human. You're allowed to be aggrieved and get frustrated. It will change in future if we can use the whole system [technological aids to detect snicks]. If you're going to use it, use it all.'' England will do just that in the home series against Bangladesh in May. But Sidebottom also said: \"The odd decision didn't go our way but it evens itself out. We just have to get on with it. We're disappointed with the way we've performed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
