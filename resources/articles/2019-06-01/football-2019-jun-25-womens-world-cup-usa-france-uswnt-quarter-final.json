It wasn\u2019t pretty for the Americans, and the reigning champions finally look vulnerable. Here are the key takeaways from Monday\u2019s round of 16 match. USA v France is the spectacle the Women\u2019s World Cup deserves From the moment the World Cup draw was made, everyone seemed to be talking about the possibility that the host nation, France, could face the No 1-ranked team, the US. Now it\u2019s really happening. Not only will the match send a favorite packing, it should be a brilliant display of two top-quality teams with massive fan support squaring off. The players welcome the hype. \u201cI hope it\u2019s huge and crazy,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said. \u201cThis is the best game \u2013 this is what everybody wanted, we want it, seems like they\u2019re up for it. You guys [the media] are up for it, and all the fans. Maybe it\u2019ll be a pretty even split with the fans in the stadium \u2013 we\u2019ve been traveling pretty deep in this World Cup. I hope it\u2019s just a total shitshow circus. It\u2019s gonna be totally awesome and these are the biggest games you dream about as a kid.\u201d Have Spain offered a blueprint to beat the US? For all the talk of Spain being a technical team, their gameplan on Monday seemed to be more about pestering the US, and the favorites never looked settled. Alex Morgan in particular was the target of an extra little dig every time she challenged for the ball, and by the end of the game it appeared all those knocks were catching up. \u201cWe were trying to tell the ref that, especially with Alex, it was upper back every single time,\u201d Rapinoe said of Spain\u2019s fouling. At one point, Morgan could be seen counting to the ref, apparently showing how many times she had been kneed in the back. That\u2019s why the penalty that Rose Lavelle earned was so surprising. If there was contact, it was minimal \u2013 but public opinion from pundits and fans on social media has been split. \u201cI got kicked in the shin,\u201d Lavelle said when asked if she felt the call was correct. \u201cA foul\u2019s a foul, so I guess it\u2019s a penalty, yeah.\u201d VAR hasn\u2019t exactly shone in this tournament, and those who disagree with the penalty will be annoyed the referee didn\u2019t overturn her decision. But if \u201cclear and obvious\u201d is supposed to be the standard, perhaps VAR worked better in this match than others \u2013 with opinion divided as to whether Virginia Torrecilla made contact with Lavelle, it was probably best to let the on-field call stand. France, who await in the quarter-finals, are a much stronger and more athletic team than Spain, and if they go after the US players like Spain did, it could be a tough match for the champions. \u2026 But this may be just what the US needed USA\u2019s utter dominance of their group games led many pundits to declare that the Americans would stroll to the final. But winning a World Cup is never going to be cushy all the way through, and it was unclear how the Americans would cope with adversity. The US response against Spain wasn\u2019t all that convincing. But it may be that they needed a tougher match to fortify their resolve. Becky Sauerbrunn said as much after the Spain game. \u201cIt was good to know we could grind out a victory and if we needed to win dirty, we could win dirty,\u201d she said. The Americans have the oldest squad in France, but they do have a slew of players \u2013 such as Lavelle, Samantha Mewis, Lindsey Horan and Abby Dahlkemper \u2013 making their World Cup debuts. The newbies gained valuable lessons on Monday. \u201cWhen you get to the knockout round, it\u2019s so much more pressure and it\u2019s so much more tense out there,\u201d Rapinoe said. \u201cEverything matters, every play matters, and every wave of the game is important. Halfway through the second half it was like, \u2018We need to take this up a notch.\u2019 There\u2019s quite a few of us that have been there and realize those moments, and that experience was good for us today.\u201d The defense narrative isn\u2019t going away Who was at fault for Spain\u2019s goal? Was it goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher for playing the ball to Becky Sauerbrunn, who had her back turned to her opponent? Or was it Sauerbrunn, who didn\u2019t respond quickly enough to the pressure from forward Lucia Garcia? Sauerbrunn accepted the blame after the match, saying she tried to play through the pressure rather than clear the ball. She also fielded questions about Naeher, insisting that the doubts about the goalkeeper were more about building narratives in the media than anything else. She may be right, but it doesn\u2019t mean those narratives are going away. The scariest moment of the group stage for the US was a Naeher gaff on a Chile set-piece that would have resulted in a goal without the offside flag. And Spain\u2019s goal, of course, came from an error too. Rapinoe, however, said mistakes will happen \u2013 it\u2019s all about how the US respond to them. \u201cThose things are going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want them to happen but when they do, we can\u2019t be, \u2018Don\u2019t do that!\u2019 and dwelling on it \u2013 it\u2019s like, \u2018No shit, don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Just stay in it and have each other\u2019s back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
