Poor Ashes. We put so much pressure on them this year, even demanding they perform twice, and they did their best to put on a good show. Still, we're not happy. Sir Ian Botham has complained \u2013 wait, keep reading \u2013 that the groundsmen are to blame for a boring series, while others blame England's conservative batting. Sure, the series never lived up to the promise of that opening game at Trent Bridge and the most memorable performance of this final Test is going to be Chris Tremlett taking an 8-fer \u2013 at Durham. But you know what? It's been OK. We've had plenty of wickets, reversals and individual innings to enjoy, plus I will always thank this series for teaching me new uses for silicon tape. In the absence of anything else to do today, I have curated my own personal highlights package, which I share with you now. Our players celebrating the Ashes with a fag. Not long ago, England retaining the urn would have automatically triggered a bender of Hemingway proportions. We are now so used to Ashes success that it merely merits a sneaky ciggie. Bet they celebrated the series win with some Words with Friends and an early night. Hearing Jim Maxwell say Khawaja. Nothing has ever sounded more Australian. Tony Abbott, take note. Cricket going meta. You know you're waist-deep in post-post-modernism when Ian Ward and his giant wheelie screen are out on the pitch, half an hour before play starts, showing England players where they're going wrong. Then Shane Warne started communicating directly with Darren Lehmann through the medium of the commentary earpiece the Australian coach was sporting on the balcony. As self-referential TV goes, Sky Sports will soon be outdoing Community. My phone's auto-correct offering me \"Eaten\" as an alternative spelling for \"Warne\". The ECB negotiating for Billy the Trumpeter. The news that Giles Clarke had gone in to bat for the Barmy Army's musician-cum-orchestrator of chants \u2013 and made sure he wasn't banned from grounds during the summer \u2013 showed an uncharacteristically cuddly side, like when Groundhog Day-Bill Murray learns to like other people. Shane Watson looking, in a certain light, like Sharpe-era Sean Bean. No? Just me, then. Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann walking in the Old Trafford Test. I know they probably did it just to wind up the Aussies but it still gave me a twinge of nostalgia. The final day at Chester-le-Street. Yes, this Oval Test has been dull as the ditchwater that has been gathering on the covers but before we walk away from the series like an Ofsted inspector, shaking our heads and scribbling \"unsatisfactory\", we need to remember what a brilliant denouement we had just last Test. The contest between Harris and the England tail! The drops, the spills, the missed run-outs! David Warner's inside-out six! Broad bowling all that sexy end-to-end stuff! You've forgotten already? You're killing me. Mitchell Starc smacking a ball back down the ground and just missing Brad Haddin's cream crackers. Hey, I didn't say this list was going to be highbrow. Joe Root running in the field. Watching him sprint to the boundary, his arms pumping awkwardly away from his body, his hands held flatter than Tom Cruise channelling Arnie, I see not an athlete at the top of their chosen sport but the physically challenged maths student doing their darndest on sports day. He gives us all hope. The ad breaks, which this summer offered a crash course in masculinity. From HP's \"Sauce of Manliness\" (turn that sandwich into a manwich!), to the Real McCoy's \"Man Crisps\", I have never been offered more insight into how to be a bloke. It's about giving a blinding best man's speech, coaching kids' soccer in the rain and drinking Strongbow. I think I'm ready, chaps. Hand me that manwich. Kim's hair in super slo-mo. Oh wait \u2013 that wasn't at the cricket. Alastair Cook's goatee. He needed to do something to soften that jawline, didn't he? The Australian legends sitting in the stands. While Hugh Jackman and Mumford were living the high life in hospitality, Merv Hughes, Jeff Thomson and Allan Border were proving their ocker Aussie credentials, drinking beer and wearing unflattering headgear with their tour groups \u2013 and I couldn't have loved them more. Chris Rogers fielding in glasses. If only because it prompted this line, in the commentary box, from Mike Atherton to Nasser Hussain: \"You had the laser surgery done, didn't you? Was that before you finished?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
