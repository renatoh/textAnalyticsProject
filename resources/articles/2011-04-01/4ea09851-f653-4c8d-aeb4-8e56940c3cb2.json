Duchesses might be seen as pantomime or Gilbert and Sullivan, were it not that they underwrite an entire system of patronage and obeisance. One of the most notable recent examples of this is David Cameron's appointment in the past year of 117 \"lords\", who henceforward, unelected, will have the right to determine matters of state for the rest of us. Emeritus professor William R Roff Columbia University, New York \u2022 I imagine numerous Guardian readers of ancient loyalty, like me, chuckled knowingly on 1 April (Editorial) at your embrace of the monarchical cause but who now, as such coverage in your pages becomes ever more extensive, are ruefully concluding they were the victims of a right-royal double-take. Richard Allen Cambridge \u2022 April Fools' Day is over. Do we have to endure the Middletons' coat of arms on the front page?
