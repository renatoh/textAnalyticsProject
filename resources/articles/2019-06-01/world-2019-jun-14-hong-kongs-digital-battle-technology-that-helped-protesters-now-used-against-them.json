According to Ip, an administrator of the group of more than 30,000 people, they discussed things like bringing sunscreen, water, and umbrellas to block the sun or rain. Two days after the protest, which saw as many as one million Hong Kong residents march against the proposed extradition law, authorities arrived at Ip\u2019s apartment in the evening. Banging on the door, they yelled: \u201cPolice! Open up the door!\u201d For the next eight hours, the police, with a warrant for Ip\u2019s arrest on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, raided his room and questioned him at home and at the police station. After forcing him to unlock his phone and downloading chats from the group, they interrogated him about the group\u2019s creator, the purpose of the forum, and whether Ip knew of other groups for planning \u201cradical actions\u201d. Ip\u2019s arrest is one of several cases that have generated a wave of anxiety among protesters in Hong Kong, thousands of whom have come out to rally against a law they believe spells the end of freedom for their city, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory where residents have long enjoyed freedom of speech and press, and unfettered access to the internet, unlike their peers on the mainland. A protest movement that once capitalised on messaging apps and social media platforms is now seeing those same tools used against it. During pro-democracy protests in 2014, the mostly young, digitally savvy protesters mobilised and organised a two-month shutdown of the city over public platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and through groups on WhatsApp. Now, more protesters are keeping a low profile on social media, communicating only via secure messaging apps, deleting conversations related to the protests, and using pre-paid SIM cards not linked to their personal information. Wary of being tracked, others are disabling location tracking on their phones and buying paper subway tickets rather than using metro cards linked to their IDs. Protesters have been cautioned to always wear face masks, in case photos are used to identify them. Many declined to give out their phone numbers or contacts to reporters, fearing their information could wind up in the hands of police. \u201cIt is unprecedented for Hong Kong put such high pressure on freedom of speech. People are getting muted, as the regime wants,\u201d Ip said, describing such methods as a \u201cwhite terror\u201d. Paranoia and \u2018picnics\u2019 Ip was released on bail around 3am on the morning of 12 June and is currently working with a lawyer on the case. The charge of inciting others to cause a public nuisance carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. The Telegram chat group Ip was in has now been shut down. The methods are reminiscent of mainland China, where citizens can be detained for comments posted on social media and dissidents\u2019 communication is often surveilled. Telegram said on Wednesday it had suffered \u201cpowerful\u201d denial of service (DDoS) attacks, originating from China. The platform\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, said the attacks coincided with the protests in Hong Kong that day. Much of the fear among Hong Kong protesters comes from the arrests of previous leaders of the 2014 protests who were charged with related crimes of inciting public nuisance and sentenced to varying jail terms. \u201cPeople are very cautious now,\u201d said Billy Li a convener for the Hong Kong Progressive Lawyers Group. \u201cThe incitement charge has made people very concerned about whether they can be charged similarly when they say something on the internet.\u201d As a result, the protesters are also changing their language. In an online call, activists invited residents to join a \u201cpicnic\u201d in a park the government complex on the evening of 11 June. By the next day, thousands of protesters had surrounded the government. Experts say another concern is what Hong Kong authorities do with the personal data of protesters. The police are equipped with cameras. The biometric data of those arrested is collected. It is not clear how long such data is kept for and for what it is used, according to Craig Choy, a data protection lawyer. Choy warned that another risk is Beijing being given access to the personal data of Hong Kong residents who have participated in the protests. \u201cThere is no restriction on cross-border data transfer. All this can be sent to China. It\u2019s like throwing a stone into the sea. You don\u2019t know how they are going to use it.\u201d Still, Ip says he is not so easily intimidated. \u201cEverywhere in Hong Kong are civilians who believe they can exercise their public power in a lawful way. And I do believe in hope, that Hong Kongers will keep fighting for their dreams and will weather this storm.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
