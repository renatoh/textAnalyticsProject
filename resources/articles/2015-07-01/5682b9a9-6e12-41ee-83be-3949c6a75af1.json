The Sense and Sensibility and Nanny McPhee star said the world was in a \u201cworse state than I have known it, particularly for women\u201d. Thompson is the latest female actor to speak out about sexism in television and film, following comments by stars including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Helen Mirren and director Jane Campion. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any appreciable improvement and I think that, for women, the question of how they are supposed to look is worse than it was even when I was young,\u201d she told the new issue of Radio Times. \u201cSo, no, I am not impressed, at all. I think it\u2019s still completely shit, actually.\u201d Thompson said: \u201cWhen I was younger I really did think we were on our way to a better world and when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women and I find that very disturbing and sad. \u201cSo I get behind as many young female performers as I can and actually a lot of the conversations with them are about exactly the fact that we are facing and writing about the same things and nothing has changed, and that some forms of sexism and unpleasantness to women have become more entrenched and indeed more prevalent.\u201d Thompson, 56, plays a 77-year-old prostitute in her latest project, The Legend of Barney Thomson, opposite co-star Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty) who is also the film\u2019s director. \u201cIt is a bit ageist,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cIt would be really nice to get someone who is actually 77 to play her, but it\u2019s a wildly comic role and I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d It is not the first time Thompson, who won an Oscar for her 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Sense and Sensibility, has addressed the issue. Publicising her Disney film Saving Mr Banks two years ago, she said there was a period in her 30s when she was offered \u201ca whole string of roles that basically involved saying to a man: \u2018Please don\u2019t go and do that brave thing. Don\u2019t! No, no, no!\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s a trope, the stock woman who says: \u2018Don\u2019t do the brave thing.\u2019 I said no to all of them. I\u2019m so proud.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat the ding-dong heck is going on if this is still something we\u2019re talking about?\u201d Gyllenhaal, star of BBC2 drama The Honourable Woman, said earlier this year that she was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, at 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. \u201cIt was astonishing to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh.\u201d Her comments prompted research which showed that female leads in Hollywood movies were on average four and a half years younger than their male counterparts. Prime Suspect star Helen Mirren said sexism and ageism against older female actors in the film industry was \u201cfucking outrageous\u201d. Responding to Gyllenhaal\u2019s comments in June, Mirren said: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, and twas ever thus. \u201cWe all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d Jane Campion, director of The Piano and BBC2\u2019s Elisabeth Moss drama Top of the Lake, last year said there was \u201cinherent sexism\u201d in the film industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I resent the male film-making, but there is something that women are doing that we don\u2019t get to know enough about,\u201d she said. Thompson said she would take her 15-year-old daughter, Gaia, to this summer\u2019s Edinburgh festival for the first time to watch a couple of her friends, Lily Bevan and Jessica Butcher, perform one-woman shows. \u201cIt means a lot to me because that is what I did and I want my daughter to have a look at that and say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s one way of expressing what you need to express\u2019,\u201d she told the listings magazine. \u201cI think she looks around at the prevailing culture and thinks: \u2018None of that really applies to me and I don\u2019t get it\u2019 \u2013 the magazines, the \u2018figure\u2019 culture and the handbags \u2013 it\u2019s just absolutely meaningless. So I can\u2019t wait for her to see these women writer/performers.\u201d The BBC Trust, in the corporation\u2019s annual report last week, said the BBC had to do more to put more women on television, as well as tackle a lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic actors on-screen. It was followed by the government\u2019s green paper on the future of the BBC two days later, which also said it had to do more to reflect the makeup of its audience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
