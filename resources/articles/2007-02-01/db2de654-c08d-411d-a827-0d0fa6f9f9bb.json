I'd like to book a week's skiing for March, with an emphasis on instruction. I'm not too fussed about having evenings out, but would like to be part of a group during the day. Any advice? Jo Harewood, London More and more people are going skiing alone, and in many ways it's the one type of holiday where you can guarantee meeting other people, especially if you opt for chalet rather than hotel accommodation. You can either try a chalet catering specifically for single travellers, or just take a bog-standard trip and sign up for ski school classes so you are with a group during the day. One good option (presuming they get a bit more snow) is Soldeu in Andorra, where there is a five-day ski workshop (\u00a3142) for small groups. You can stay at the four-star Sporthotel, which is connected internally to the new spa at the five-star Hermitage, so you can pamper yourself after a day on the slopes. Seven nights in March costs from \u00a3691, including flights, half-board accommodation and single supplement, with Inghams (020 8780 4433). Or for something a bit funkier, try the Hotel Dom, bang in the centre of the Swiss resort of Saas Fee. It has two bars, and no single supplements - seven nights' half-board, departing 17 March, starts from \u00a3515 including flights, also with Inghams. Three-hour group ski lessons cost \u00a3100 for five days. Chalets catering for singles include Cold Fusion in Chamonix (0870 042 8347), which costs \u00a3579 a week in March, excluding flights. Freedom in the Dominican Republic My niece is getting married in June and a group of guests is booking an all-inclusive deal at the Riu Bachata, Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. The cost for a single room and flights is about \u00a3964. I don't really want to do the all-inclusive thing as I'd like to experience life outside the compound. I'd also like to hire a car to visit them at the resort and to explore local points of interest. Please advise me on reasonably priced hotels, distance to Riu Bachata and sights worth seeing. Des Smith, Birmingham Puerto Plata is a nice enough town, but it doesn't have the beach that lures people to the all-inclusives nearby or indeed to towns like Sosua, Cabarete and Luperon. That said, Puerto Plata has a good range of accommodation at all levels and is a good place to get a feel for everyday life in the Dominican Republic. All the hotels in town are budget or midrange, the pick of the bunch being Hotel Montesilva (00 809 320 0205; doubles from \u00a320). Taxi is the easiest way to get to all the resorts along the Playa Dorada, with a journey time of around 30 minutes from the city to Riu Bachata, but you can also arrange car hire easily via the international agencies in Puerto Plata. Annual holiday insurance Where can I get worldwide annual holiday insurance? A year ago I was diagnosed with angina. Having a son in the US it would be nice to visit him. Several companies have offered me cover excluding angina, but I do need reassurance for this problem. I am not in line for an operation. I am 72 years of age. Ron Stanaway, by email There isn't a palatable answer to this problem; those tempting annual insurance rates just don't apply. You will almost certainly not find an annual policy when you have a pre-existing condition like this, because medical conditions can obviously deteriorate. I would suggest taking out cover on a trip-by-trip basis with an insurer like Medicover (0870 735 3600). However, expect it to be considerably more expensive than prices you may find on the net because older travellers make more frequent and more expensive claims, so the risk is greater. If you can arrange to meet your son outside the US, prices will go down. The website Money Saving Expert has a good comparison engine for travel insurance. \u00b7 We welcome letters.
