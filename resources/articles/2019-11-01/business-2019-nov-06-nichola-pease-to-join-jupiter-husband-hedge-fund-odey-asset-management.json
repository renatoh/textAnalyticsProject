Jupiter Fund Management said Pease would replace Liz Airey from 2 March. According to the latest Sunday Times rich list, Pease and her husband, Crispin Odey, have a combined fortune of \u00a3775m. Odey, a prominent Brexit supporter, runs a hedge fund called Odey Asset Management (OAM). According to daily filings at the Financial Conduct Authority, Odey holds a 0.66% short position on Jupiter, equivalent to a \u00a310.8m bet that its shares will fall. OAM first notified the City watchdog of a short position on the FTSE 250 firm in February, equivalent to 0.97% of the stock. In mid-October it rose to 1% before it was gradually reduced. Short sellers borrow a stock from investors in return for a fee. They then sell the shares and buy them back at a future date to return to the lender. If the price of the stock drops during that time they pocket the difference. Odey\u2019s firm declined to comment, but it is understood that it intends to close the short position. OAM and another hedge fund, Marshall Wace, have made significant bets against a number of companies that are exposed to UK consumers, including retailers, estate agents and banks, as mounting political uncertainty drags on economic growth. Odey, who backed a no-deal Brexit in the weeks leading up to the 31 October deadline, has strongly dismissed claims he had done so because he spotted an opportunity to make millions from short-selling UK companies and the pound in the event of a chaotic departure from the EU. He told the Guardian he was optimistic about the economy\u2019s prospects after Brexit and said his fund had an overall \u201cneutral\u201d position on UK stocks. Pease has more than 30 years\u2019 experience in fund management. She was the chief executive and then deputy chairman of J O Hambro Capital Asset Management from 1998 until 2008. She has since held a number of roles in the charity and public sectors, and has been on the board of asset managers Schroders since 2012. Pease comes from a family with strong connections to the City. They sold their bank to Barclays in 1902 and her father, Sir Richard Pease, was a vice-chairman at Barclays. Her older brother, Richard, is a fund manager at Crux Asset Management, after working for Henderson New Star and Jupiter. Jonathon Bond, senior independent director of Jupiter, said: \u201cAt a time when Jupiter is moving forward under new leadership and with a refreshed plan to grow the business, Nichola\u2019s industry expertise will prove invaluable.\u201d Pease is also a friend of Jupiter\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Formica, with whom she teamed up six years ago to launch a work experience programme to help young people get into the City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
