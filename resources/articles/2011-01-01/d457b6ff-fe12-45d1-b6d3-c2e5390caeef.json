The latest episode started with Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox) becoming distressed as she performs an autopsy on an eight-year-old girl, who has been brutally raped and murdered. \"Never look into their eyes,\" she says. We're only human, and it can be difficult to deal with murder cases: the forensic pathologist on the Joanna Yeates case will have spent Christmas day in a ditch with a strangled girl. But the last thing we do is get all woe-is-me about it. The only way we can help the victims is by trying to find out how they died. And a forensic pathologist has to look in a cadaver's eyes \u2013 it's one way to tell whether they've been strangled. Alexander and her team work in a very flash laboratory, with touch-screen computers like something out of the film Minority Report. In reality, our working conditions are more like a Jack the Ripper film \u2013 we usually work in hospital mortuaries, some of which date back to Victorian times. And we don't swan around dead bodies wearing designer clothes and stilettos either. At one point, we see one of the pathologists cut open a skull and remove a dead man's brain. The way he does this is quite accurate \u2013 he peels back the skin, as we would do, and then removes the bone in one large chunk. But we tend to remove organs from the torso in one go, whereas here we see livers and hearts lifted out individually. It's just all about the shock factor. I'm not stupid: I know this show is more about entertainment. But I do think it's quite damaging. We get students coming on placements who say, \"What are we doing today?\" And when I say, \"Performing three autopsies and then writing up the reports\", they look disappointed. They've probably watched Silent Witness, and so they expect us to be zooming all over town solving crimes. The reality is somewhat calmer \u2013 but a lot more professional. \u2022 Silent Witness is on BBC1 at 9pm on Mondays and Tuesdays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
