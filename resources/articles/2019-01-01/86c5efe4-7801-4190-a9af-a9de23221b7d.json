Thanks for joining me. Goodnight! Here\u2019s more from Ben Fisher on Jack Clarke, and nine other EFL teenagers to watch: Marcelo Bielsa speaks, via an interpreter: \u201cThis was a very impressive win, after losing our last two league games. We had to defend very well, which we did, and this made it easier to win the game.\u201d Pressed further on \u2018spygate\u2019, he says \u201cit\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand the situation. If for English football, this is unacceptable behaviour, then I have to accept it, because I work here. I have to accept that in this country, it\u2019s not common, but it doesn\u2019t mean I am someone who cheats.\u201d When asked if he would consider doing it again, he says \u201cI\u2019ve explained myself very well, so you can draw your own conclusions.\u201d Here\u2019s Leeds captain Liam Cooper: \u201cWe wanted to start on the front foot and I think we did that. The intensity we play at is hard to sustain sometimes, but we did it. I was a bit tired for the last 15 minutes [after coming back from injury]. It\u2019s always nice to win on a Friday night. Bielsa has got us believing, and coming into work with a smile on our face. We\u2019re all behind him.\u201d Waghorn picks up a late booking before the referee calls time. Leeds are five points clear at the top of the Championship! 93 mins: Leeds are still chasing everything down, giving Derby nothing to work with. 91 mins: Holmes hares after a loose ball to the right of goal, but the unflappable Jansson slides in to clear behind. 90 mins: Four added minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re top of the league\u201d is the factually accurate chant from the home fans. 88 mins: Leeds win a couple of corners, but Hernandez can\u2019t pick out a white shirt with his deliveries. 85 mins: Leeds win a free kick in midfield, but Hernandez overhits his diagonal pass. Time is ticking away for Derby. \u201cShackleton is on for Leeds? You can put the result on ice now\u201d honks Peter Oh. 82 mins: Roofe pounces on a Tomori error, and his shot rebounds towards Hernandez, who fires a volley into the side netting. Leeds should be out of sight. 80 mins: Alioski swings in a cross that Hernandez connects with \u2013 but his shot is scuffed wide. At the other end, Lawrence has a pot-shot that flies into the stands. 78 mins: Clarke is heading off, and gets a huge ovation. His crosses led to both Leeds goals and he was a constant menace down the right. He\u2019s replaced by Leif Davis, who celebrates his 18th birthday tomorrow. 75 mins: Derby get a free kick and their centre-backs get forward, but Mason Mount\u2019s ball in is underpowered and Leeds clear. 74 mins: After tenacious work from Nugent in the Leeds area, Bryson\u2019s shot is deflected into the path of Waghorn \u2013 but he\u2019s flagged offside as he shapes to shoot. 72 mins: Martyn Waghorn is on, replacing Jack Marriott, who couldn\u2019t get himself into the game. 71 mins: Holmes is crowded out by Hernandez, and then Alioski \u2013 both willowy wingers before Bielsa rocked up at Elland Road. 70 mins: Clarke, the standout performer so far on his first league start, motors down the right again and pings a fierce low cross that Roofe just can\u2019t get a boot to. Clarke, by the way, was born in November 2000. 69 mins: Shackleton gets into space down the right \u2013 Leeds have attacked that area all night \u2013 and fires a cross-shot across goal. Derby showing little sign of getting back into this. 67 mins: Leeds win a corner as Tomori blocks Roofe\u2019s shot. Jansson, having his shirt pulled by Keogh, tries to meet it at the near post, but puts his header wide. 65 mins: If VAR were in force here, Leeds may well have had two penalties, but their goalkeeper could have been sent off. 64 mins: Substitution for Leeds, as Shackleton replaces goalscorer Harrison. 62 mins: Duane Holmes flicks the ball over Ayling and challenges Peacock-Farrell, who collects it \u2013 but boots Holmes in the face in the process! I don\u2019t think it was intentional, but the keeper could have easily been sent off regardless \u2013 it was Man\u00e9-on-Ederson-esque. 61 mins: A second change for Derby, as Florian Jozefzoon replaces George Evans, who was booked in the first half. 60 mins: Klich and Roofe combine but Derby clear, only to concede a free kick in the centre circle. Leeds come forward again and Clarke swings in a cross, but it\u2019s too close to Carson. 58 mins: We\u2019ve cut away to Gareth Southgate and England U21 coach Aidy Boothroyd in the crowd. If it stays like this, Leeds are going five points clear \u2013 and seven ahead of third-placed Sheffield United. Replays show that Lawrence got none of the ball, and stood on Hernandez\u2019s foot. The referee was right behind it; I\u2019m not sure how he hasn\u2019t given a penalty. 53 mins: After a scrappy spell, Clarke is again the danger man, wriggling past Tomori and cutting back to Hernandez, who is challenged by Lawrence in the area... ... from which Peacock-Farrell, some 2.5 Neuers off his line, is almost embarrassed by Nugent! The keeper shanks into touch, and looks mighty relieved. 49 mins: Harrison skitters through the Derby defence, but tries to pass when he could have shot, and the visitors break... Jack Clarke causes more problems down the right, and his deep cross threatens to loop over Carson and in. The goalkeeper gets a touch, but it drops to Alioski, and his prod across goal is swept in by Jack Harrison! And Leeds have doubled their lead almost immediately! We\u2019re back under way, with David Nugent replacing Andre Wisdom. Unless Nugent is slotting in at right-back, that will mean a change of system... After the dramatic build-up, that was a rather one-sided first half. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s biggest worry would have been Leeds not adding to that Kemar Roofe goal. That, and whether Lampard spots the webcam in the Derby dressing room. Honk! Don\u2019t forget, you can follow all the latest transfers with our shiny interactive: The full story on Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s surprise \u2018spygate\u2019 confession: Leeds have a last-gasp corner, which Hernandez swings straight at Carson. Still, Leeds are ahead at the break. 47 mins: The temperature\u2019s rising late in the half, Leeds players not happy with Derby\u2019s agricultural approach there. Both Holmes and Evans are booked. 46 mins: Lowe crosses towards Marriott, who is bullied off the ball by Jansson. The defender charges forward, and is clattered first by Holmes, and then by George Evans! 45 mins: Replays show that both Ayling and Cooper were grappling with Derby players, both grabbing fistfuls of shirt as the ball came in. That\u2019s a risky move. 44 mins: The forward peels off towards the near post but mistimes his header, sending the ball into Roofe\u2019s path. Marriott appeals for a penalty, but that would have been very harsh. 43 mins: Derby win a corner, seeking an unlikely equaliser before half-time. It\u2019s held up by grappling between Alioski and Marriott... 42 mins: Derby\u2019s best opening so far, the visitors breaking as Leeds lose possession. Lawrence shapes to shoot but instead plays in Mason Mount on the left of the area. He takes a touch, but sees Ayling slide in to block his shot! 40 mins: Forshaw, pulling the strings in midfield, starts another move that ends with Clarke\u2019s low cross, which is cut out by Carson. 39 mins: Leeds stroke the ball around in front of the Derby defence, before Forshaw shoots from 25 yards out. It has Carson worried, but flies a foot wide of the far post. 37 mins: Hernandez\u2019s low ball into the near post finds Luke Ayling, who scuffs his shot wide. 36 mins: Bryson is penalised for handball, as Derby continue to struggle with Leeds\u2019 high intensity. The commentary team have reminded me of this World Cup spying saga. Improbably enough, it\u2019s the second one in a matter of months to involve a Pontus Jansson team... 34 mins: Tom Lawrence, more than capable of a long-range screamer, takes aim from distance but sends his shot high and wide. 32 mins: Leeds continue to cause problems down the flanks, with Alioski whipping in a cross that beats the Derby defence, but is just too quick for Clarke in the middle. 30 mins: Leeds have won every game where they\u2019ve scored first in the league this season; Derby have won five games from behind, the most in the division. Something\u2019s got to give. 29 mins: Alioski is penalised for a foul on Holmes, but Derby do nothing with the free kick. 28 mins: Harrison attempts to steer a header into the far corner, but it\u2019s at an awkward height and Carson collects. 27 mins: Keogh tries to break forward from defence but is quickly engulfed by white shirts. Guardian political correspondent weighs in on Spygate: 24 mins: Dazzling stuff from Clarke, who collects a diagonal pass from Forshaw on his chest and juggles the ball beyond a defender. He can\u2019t apply the finish, though, sending his shot wide. 22 mins: Derby, resolutely defensive thus far, will need to venture forward now. Leeds\u2019 recent results should give them encouragement \u2013 they\u2019ve conceded at least two goals in all their last five matches. A deserved lead for the hosts, and Scott Carson may have to take some of the blame for a weak punch clear. It was expertly set up by Clarke though, and ruthlessly finished at the near post by Roofe. The young winger motors down the right beyond Bryson and sweeps a low cross into Kemar Roofe, who slams a near-post shot into the net! 19 mins: Leeds corner, which Hernandez swings in towards Cooper. Carson punches clear, but it lands at the feet of Jack Clarke... 18 mins: Bryson picks the ball up in midfield, but has a lack of options upfield and his attempted waft up to Marriott is ineffective. 16 mins: Elland Road is rocking, but the free kick into the box is a big disappointment. Derby break but the move peters out. 14 mins: Alioski races forward from his left-back position to dispossess Andre Wisdom. He is unceremoniously upended by the Derby man, who goes in the book. 13 mins: Leeds continue to camp in the Derby half as the home fans twirl their scarves in the air. Just lacking that killer pass at the moment. Two things are bugging me about this whole Bielsa business. 1. Has this great managerial innovator not heard of drones and/or television? 2. Do Bielsa teams not largely play the same way regardless of opposition? Leeds are charging and pressing around in the usual style here, that\u2019s for sure. 10 mins: Ayling prods a pass through to Roofe, whose off-balance effort is easily collected by Carson. Charles Antaki chimes in on Spygate: \u201cFor cast-iron insurance against failure, all a club need do now is kit out one of their staff in camouflage, give them a pair of binoculars (need not be real) and get them to skulk about in the training ground undergrowth before the big game. Heavy defeat? \u201cGuy in the bushes\u201d. Beats \u201cif only there were VAR\u201d as the next modern cliche.\u201d 8 mins: Oooooh, what a chance! The corner skims across the six-yard line and Cooper gets a toe to it, but can\u2019t keep it under the bar. A strong start by the hosts... 7 mins: It\u2019s cleared but Leeds come again, and Harrison\u2019s cross from the left is chopped behind by Richard Keogh. 6 mins: Roofe is working hard up top for Leeds, and forces Tomori into conceding a corner... 4 mins: Marriott gets on the ball for Derby, but is dealt with by Pontus Jansson. The Leeds fans appear to be singing \u201cwe\u2019ll spy when we want\u201d, which is to be encouraged. Alioski pounces on a defensive error from Wisdom, who then bundles the Leeds man over! Referee Andy Davies points to the spot, but the assistant has flagged offside. After a quick chat, Derby are let off the hook. There\u2019s just one problem \u2013 Alioski wasn\u2019t offside. Dear oh dear. Here we go \u2013 Leeds charge forward, and Alioski goes over in the area... An extremely businesslike handshake between Bielsa and Lampard. All a bit awkward. Kick-off is seconds away! \u201cFrank is looking for an excuse in case Derby lose\u201d says Frank Downes. \u201cHow is it illegal or against the rules to watch training on public land?\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting it\u2019s illegal \u2013 just that it\u2019s, you know, not cool. Although in my impromptu poll, 57% reckon it\u2019s fine. You unscrupulous bunch. Have your say! Marcelo Bielsa is sorry that Derby were upset, but says eavesdropping on training sessions is not against the rules. The steam from Frank Lampard\u2019s ears told its own story. What do you think? Crikey. After all that drama, easy to forget there\u2019s a game on. Here are the teams: Naughty Leeds (4-1-4-1): Peacock-Farrell; Ayling, Cooper, Jansson, Alioski; Forshaw; Harrison, Klich, Hernandez, Clarke; Roofe. Subs: Huffer, Davis, Halme, Shackleton, Gotts, Stevens, Roberts. Mardy Derby (4-3-3): Carson; Wisdom, Keogh, Tomori, Lowe; Bryson, Evans, Mount; Holmes, Marriott, Lawrence. Subs: Roos, Waghorn, Jozefzoon, Nugent, Bogle, Huddlestone, Malone. Frank Lampard gives his thoughts. He\u2019s accepted Bielsa owning up, but it clearly still fuming: \u201cOn a sporting level, it\u2019s bad, in my opinion. Talking about \u2018I did it somewhere else, it\u2019s fine\u2019 \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work for me. It\u2019s disrupted our preparations. Police had to come to the training ground, so that was disruptive. \u201cWe were training on team tactics, shape, personnel, and the fact that Harry Wilson wasn\u2019t training. He\u2019s admitted it, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any further action \u2013 but we had a guy in the bushes before we played Leeds earlier this season, and we lost 4-1.\u201d Marcelo Bielsa has spoken to Sky, via an interpreter. He has taken full responsibility for the spying incident, and apologised to Frank Lampard. \u201cIt\u2019s true, there was someone from Leeds there. The responsibility for this incident is mine. It doesn\u2019t matter if this is legal or illegal, right or wrong \u2026 for me it\u2019s enough that Frank Lampard and Derby County were unhappy, to show that I didn\u2019t behave well. Yesterday I talked to Frank and he told me I didn\u2019t respect his club. I have a different point of view, but the important thing is what he and Derby think. \u201cI\u2019m the only one responsible for it, I didn\u2019t ask Leeds for permission to do that. I\u2019ve been using this kind of practice since the World Cup qualifiers with Argentina. This is not unlawful, we\u2019ve done it publicly, we talk about it in the press, for some people it\u2019s the wrong thing to do \u2013 for others it\u2019s not.\u201d Good evening. A rivalry that has been slowly cooling down for over 40 years is heating up again, fuelled by a furious promotion race and ignited today by an old-fashioned spying drama. Both of these big city clubs have been effectively rebranded by summer managerial appointments, but their bold moves are paying off. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds United are leading the Championship, while Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County are in the top six. This match was already an intriguing prospect, pitting MBLU\u2019s high-press infantry up against the swashbuckling starlets of FLDC. Today\u2019s developing drama, with FLDC accusing MBLU of sending a bloke in a tracksuit to patrol their training compound, adds the necessary needle and takes us back in time. In the early 70s, Don Revie\u2019s Leeds and Brian Clough\u2019s Derby routinely muddied each other\u2019s pristine shirts as they tussled for major trophies, while the managers traded barbs and compared lapel sizes on the touchline. Now both clubs are heading back towards the big time, and are back in each other\u2019s business. Kick-off is 7.45pm, GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
