A game dominated by brutal challenges, one bringing a deserved red card for the Rovers midfielder Trevor Challis was won by Vale after Naylor converted a Marc Bridge-Wilkinson cross from six yards. Earlier Nick Culkin made several fine saves to keep Vale at bay, even if he should have been beaten when Naylor missed a glorious six-yard chance. With the a pitch resembling a lunar landscape this was a million miles from the Premiership, as was the two-footed lunge by Robbie Pethick on Sagi Burton after 30 minutes which received only a yellow card from Keith Hill. Pethick was fortunate the chal lenge was not caught by cameras. Challis was not so fortunate moments later, however, after a wild challenge on Michael Walsh. On this occasion, Hill went straight for his red card. Since this game's initial postponement on New Year's Day Brian Horton, Vale's manager, has now guided his team to a 16-game unbeaten run to stave off the threat of a second successive relegation for the club. Last season's fall from the First Division was the first time as a manager that Horton experienced relegation. How ironic then that three of Horton's former clubs, Manchester City, Huddersfield and Oxford, could all be tasting life at a lower level next season. Vale should take note. Let Horton leave at your peril! Horton should have few fears after their fine run. The Rovers manager Garry Thompson is in need of a similar revival for his side to escape the bottom four. Burton's free header after less than a minute saw Culkin produce the first of his saves. Then the Rovers forward Chris Lee saw a 20-yard shot fly narrowly wide on four minutes and his side almost struck on 48 minutes after Vitalijs Astafjevs beat Burton to a ball that stuck in the mud. He released the substitute Kevin Gall, whose angled drive was well saved by Mark Goodlad. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
