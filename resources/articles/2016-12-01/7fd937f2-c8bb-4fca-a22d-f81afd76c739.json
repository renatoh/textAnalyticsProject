The challenge from Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s left-back came towards the end of United\u2019s 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Sunday. Rose was booked by Robert Madley and although Mourinho stated he believed the referee had a good game the manager signalled his unhappiness at Rose and said it might have a been a red-card offence if committed earlier in the contest. \u201cI am not happy but it is football and sometimes you go over the limit in a big match,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cThe referee did very well and I am happy for him because normally these matches are given to the ref with more experience, more status. I think for him it was the biggest match he had refereed in the Premier League. He did very well and probably he wanted to finish the game without a red card. He gave a yellow card and for me that\u2019s fine.\u201d Last month Rose was singled out by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger for a tackle on Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn that ruled the right-back out, again with an ankle injury. When defending Rose Pochettino said that football was a \u201ccontact sport\u201d and Mourinho echoed the stance. \u201cWhen everything ends well, like with Miki, not having a big injury, let\u2019s move on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a big game, hard and sometimes a bit nasty but it was a game for men.\u201d Mkhitaryan is expected to be available again for Sunderland\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Mourinho suggested Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin can leave United in January should the club receive an offer or the players ask to go. Depay has started only one game \u2013 an EFL Cup win at Northampton \u2013 and made seven substitute appearances. Schneiderlin has made three starts \u2013 in the EFL Cup and Europa League \u2013 and five substitute appearances. Asked about each player\u2019s future, Mourinho said: \u201cI am always open to listen to offers for every player. More than listen to offers I am always ready to listen to the players themselves. So any player who knocks on my door and is not happy and wants to move, when the offers are correct, I will never stop a player from leaving even if it is to a rival. When [Juan] Mata left Chelsea [when he was manager in January 2013] to come to Manchester United, no problem at all. In my mentality, no problem at all. I am always open. \u201cWhat I can say is that I am happy with the squad I have. I would like my squad to be my squad until the end of the season and I am not going to any player to say: \u2018You are going to leave,\u2019 because I am not happy because I don\u2019t want to have him. \u201cI am happy with the players I have, even with players that are not having many opportunities to play. From my point of view I am happy to keep everyone and everyone will have a chance, sometimes an unexpected chance.\u201d Mourinho expects Bastian Schweinsteiger to still be in the squad following the January window. \u201cI do. Unless again the player knocks on our door with a future that he wants to grab with both hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I never stop players doing what they want if, I repeat if, the conditions are right for the club.\u201d Mourinho said that Luke Shaw, who is injured, still needs to work on his game. \u201cHe needs to improve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is normal \u2013 he is a kid. I am not expecting a young player to be perfect. A young player makes mistakes, a young player has things to learn, has things to develop. He needs to do that. How many matches has he already played for me? A lot. He was injured playing, not on the bench. I need him back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
