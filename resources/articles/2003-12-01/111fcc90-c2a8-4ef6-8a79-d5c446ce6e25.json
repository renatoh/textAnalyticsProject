Wark was questioned last Wednesday by John Campbell QC, the counsel to the Fraser inquiry, which is investigating the Holyrood fiasco after the bill to construct the new parliamentary building spiralled from \u00a340m to \u00a3400m. But Mr Campbell now faces allegations that he failed to declare a conflict of interest, because he and Wark had known each other for many years. Wark was a bridesmaid at Mr Campbell's wedding and his wife Marion performed the same duty when she got married. Scottish opposition politicians have criticised Mr Campbell for not declaring his interest and stepping aside from questioning Wark, according to the Scotsman. They have also questioned why she was not asked about the ongoing row between the Fraser inquiry and the BBC, which has refused to hand over tapes of a documentary about the Holyrood project. The Holyrood documentary is being made by the independent TV production company run by Wark and her husband, Alan Clements. Eyebrows have also been raised about the fact that Mr Campbell made a joking reference to one of Wark's Newsnight catchphrases - \"more of that story later\" - while he was questioning her. It has been reported that Mr Campbell dropped this phrase in deliberately to win a \u00a31 bet with his daughter. Scottish National Party MSP Fergus Ewing called for Lord Fraser to recall Wark and take over the questioning duties himself. Wark has issued a statement confirming she was a bridesmaid at Mr Campbell's wedding 16 years ago, and that his wife was a bridesmaid at her wedding soon afterwards. She also admitted she has been friendly with Mrs Campbell since university, where the two shared a house. But she insisted this friendship with the Campbells had not influenced her when she appeared before the Fraser inquiry. \"Due to the vagaries of family life, we have not seen Marion and John socially for a number of years. This friendship had no bearing whatever on the conduct of my interview at the inquiry, where I spoke truthfully and, I hope, frankly,\" Wark said. Wark has already faced accusations of having a conflict of interest over the Holyrood project because she was on the panel that selected the design for the massively over budget Scottish parliament building, as well as being a founder of the TV company making the BBC documentary about the project. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
