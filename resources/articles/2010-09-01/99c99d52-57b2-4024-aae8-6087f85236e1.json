Miriam Clegg That's why I left it behind. Official Oh it's you Mrs Clegg. You'd better come in. Miriam Do I have to? Nick Clegg I stood here before you two years ago saying we were on the verge of big change. I bet none of you realised just how big. Conference No kidding, Tory Boy. Clegg Cynics said we lacked the courage to change our convictions. But we've proved them wrong. And we've changed the landscape of British politics. Though I admit it took a while to explain to my children how I'd gone from leader of the Lib Dems to number two in the Tory party ... Conference You've still got a bit of explaining to do to us ... Clegg I know that some of you are concerned we have abandoned the Liberal Democrat manifesto. And so we have. But we have a coalition manifesto, which is a sort of fluffy Conservative manifesto and I get to drive around in big cars and look important, so that's got to be good. Most of all, though, I misjudged David Cameron. I thought he was just a Tory toff, but now I've realised he's also got dreamy eyes and snake hips ... Miriam Can I go now? Clegg And we've made a real difference already. We've won a vote on the electoral system that we're going to lose and we're going to change the education system ... Conference Over our dead body ... Danny Alexander We'll do what we like, losers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
