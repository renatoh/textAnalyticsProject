The video of the mass beheading of the 21 prisoners in Libya was released on Sunday, but for days images of captives in regulation orange uniforms, paraded by black-clad gunmen had haunted the international community. \u201cWe have met this news with sorrow and disbelief \u2013 although people saw this coming there was a hope that something could be done to change the outcome,\u201d said Bishop Angaelos, General Bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom. \u201cWhen it came it was so heartless and inhumane.\u201d Angaelos, head of the orthodox Christian community in the UK, received a call from the prime minister, who expressed his condolences for the murder of the guest workers, who were kidnapped in Sirte, on Libya\u2019s coast, by Isis members in December and January. A video made of the murders titled \u201ca message signed in blood to the people of the cross\u2019, makes reference to the \u201chostile Egyptian Church\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister focused on the fact that these actions are unacceptable by the principles we live by in this country,\u201d he said. That may come of little consolation to UK Coptic Christians, most of whom have relatives in Egypt, some from the very same villages and provinces as the killed hostages. Egyptian Coptic Christians are the largest Christian community in the Middle East, with an estimated 10-15 million members in Egypt \u2013 around 10% of the population. Coptics follow an orthodox strand of Christianity which requires them to closely follow the church\u2019s dogma, which includes fasting for some part of 210 days a year. They formed a community in the UK in the 60s, which now has around 20,000 members. Many of them are now living in fear, said Father Antonious Thabet, a priest at St Mark\u2019s church in Kensington. \u201cWe are very scared, some people in my congregation have said they are scared to be in the UK \u2013 these people are everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is anger against leaders who did nothing. They have to do something, saying that we are sorry this had happened is not enough.\u201d Special services will be held in Coptic churches throughout the UK this week, while peaceful demonstrations of solidarity are planned for the weekend. Magda Sakr, an Egyptian muslim who has lived in the UK for 20 years will be among the mourners. \u201cPeople are trying to separate Christian and Muslims, but we are all Egyptian,\u201d she said, fighting back tears. \u201cThese people have nothing to do with Islam, they are maniacs. This is not about religion, it is about standing up for humanity.\u201d Her friend, Shenouda Shalaby, a doctor at Ealing hospital and a member of Father Antonious congregation, said the world needed to wake up. \u201cWe are not fighting an invasion \u2013 this ideology is already here, it is spreading like a cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be frank this is only the tip of the iceberg. Unless the world unites, it will be a disaster for all of us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
