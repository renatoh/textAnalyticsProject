The first two episodes of the cult show are available from tonight on the official Lost community-branded page on MySpace UK. Sky poached the rights to the latest series of Lost from Channel 4 for a reported $20m (\u00a310.3m). The deal with MySpace makes it the only free-to-air location to view the programme. Sky is using the social networking website as a promotional vehicle for the series, which debuted with a double bill on 19 November. The number of viewers of the show has dipped by more than one million since shifting from Channel 4 to Sky. Sky intends to show especially commissioned Lost programming on the MySpace page as well as teaser material for upcoming episodes. News Corporation owns MySpace and has a 39% stake in BSkyB. A MySpace spokesman said that the agreement did not, at this point, extend to airing any more episodes. The agreement does not include any element of payment based upon the number of streams viewed by UK fans. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
