A great grey gap, above the hearth of a rented holiday home, slightly lighter than the wallpaper around. It's where a picture once hung, removed by a family so they can better enjoy their stay. It sounds simple. Yet that patch is one of the most brilliant and frightening sights in cinema in years. Why? Let's return to that later. Suffice to say: it doesn't work. Even with the offending pic stashed behind the sofa, the Leighton family in Archipelago have what must be the most godawful hols since \u2013 well, since the family in Hogg's Tuscan villa debut, Unrelated. When Hogg first emerged with that film in 2008, it was as if from nowhere (in fact, she was mentored by Derek Jarman, then did a decade of duty on Casualty and EastEnders). It won awards and acclaim and much autobiographical speculation about its central character, a fortysomething woman visiting friends, without her husband, without children. Archipelago looks superficially similar \u2013 another posh but botched vacation, this one on Tresco in the Scilly Isles (where Hogg spent Easters as a child), and like Unrelated choked by the noose of family ties; bonds which are worried at by outsiders. But this time round you'd have a harder time confusing the director with the protagonist: Edward, 28, played by Tom Hiddleston, whom Hogg cast fresh out of Rada as a merciless flirt in Unrelated. Here, he's a doubtful banker who's quit the city to volunteer in Africa; the trip is intended as a jolly send-off. \"Sometimes,\" says Hogg carefully, \"it feels like ideas can be almost too directly communicated. I wanted to try to engage my imagination a little bit more, and so not just make a series of films about me \u2013 I think that could get quite boring.\" Over the past few years, she and Hiddleston have discussed their experiences of struggling to hang on to freedom within a clan identity, especially at landmark events \u2013 Christmas, birthdays, trips away. \"It's something that has always preoccupied me: how in that context one can lose a sense of oneself. That's why I'm interested in the family as a location. Sometimes one dreams of a responsibility-free life. But that doesn't really exist because one's so interconnected to everything else. \"And then I thought it would be interesting to create a character that has elements of myself but a man, a lot younger. The other characters are equally bits and pieces of me. Cynthia [Edward's hard-nosed elder sister] I do totally identify with. I can be very controlling, but also very indecisive. We all have contradictions. Part of what I'm interested to do is to understand them. I'm posing questions for other people, but also asking them of myself. I don't always get the answers I want.\" She laughs: friendly, intense, responsive, extremely slim and groomed, a woman of the class she portrays. (Hiddleston emails me later to say they share \"a sense that our experience of life and our backgrounds were considered to be somehow artistically inauthentic\" \u2013 and indeed both films have been revolutionary in their straightforward presentation of privilege). Now 50, she has a strata of slight self-consciousness that bespeaks the particular introspection of her work. For despite the transference across age and gender in her latest, her sensibility is absolutely what feeds her films. After so many years in TV watching what she'd shot be re-edited without warning, Hogg now makes her movies her way, about her concerns, and that's it. (\"I would never, ever, ever, ever want to return to that way of working.\") Her history has made her wary of public funding \u2013 not that the UK Film Council was especially forthcoming when it came to Archipelago, whose \u00a3500,000 budget was partly stumped up by an aesthetically sympathetic Japanese businessman \u2013 or, really, any money that might take away that freedom. \"If a Hollywood studio was interested in it I don't think that would support the way I work at all. It would become a fight and my energy would get transferred onto something else.\" And that cinematic style \u2013 unusually authored for a Brit, easily bearing comparison to her heroes (Ozu, Bresson, Rohmer) \u2013 has astonishing poise and cohesion: long, wide-angle takes, no soundtrack save amped-up birdsong, a commitment to non-professionals in half the roles. The process is key: the cast live on location, in the house in which they're shooting. Scenes are filmed in chronological order. Hiddleston again: \"Joanna imposes a very formal structure to the story as a whole \u2013 written by her as a tone poem or novella \u2013 but with no formally scripted dialogue, so within each beat there is a huge amount of freedom.\" Takes can last 30 minutes. Rather than shouting \"action\", she says \"In your own time...\" While Unrelated bore the residue of her tenure on soaps, its narrative propelled by conventional dramatic devices \u2013 sexual desire, rejection, catharsis \u2013 Archipelago is a more immediately distilled and austere work. We're given more time, as an audience, to absorb the scene. Oddly, this makes it funnier, in the same way as Curb Your Enthusiasm \u2013 once you're primed for its embarrassments. Those yawning long shots, held beyond the point of forbearance, give you an extraordinary vantage point on everyone's buckled body language. A handful of set pieces are laugh-out-loud nightmarish. \"Making films makes me feel there's some purpose to things. It makes me feel a little less gloomy. I'm more and more interested in humour as a way to explore that. I took myself more seriously with Unrelated. But now I get a pleasure out of taking a situation so far it becomes funny.\" What's strange about Hogg's films is that however gruellingly amusing, they're fundamentally statements of compassion. She may be dealing with issues of import to her, but in a way that's of great benefit to others \u2013 partly why she leaves some threads as open-ended as possible. A couple of her friends, for instance, responded with their own stories to unexplained scenes of Cynthia, weeping alone. \"I found that almost shocking. I had created something which enabled them to come out with interpretations I would never have dreamed of. They were convinced I had always intended those things. But for me they were unrecognisable.\" She smiles: happy to help, if half by accident. \"I'm not interested how easy it is to live one's life, because I think it is quite difficult. As I'm getting older, I'm just far more aware of my own mortality than I ever was. I was already thinking about death in my 40s, but not nearly as much as I am now. And I think: what will it be like in 10 years time? I'm really fearful of death, actually, this idea that we will suddenly not exist.\" A gulp of coffee. \"It's interesting because people who are older than me don't confess to me that they think about it the whole time, but maybe they are. It's not even something I talk about very much with my husband, for example. I'm always fearful of talking about it at home because I think somehow they'll be no going back from that. It's that void. I don't think it needs to be articulated any more.\" Which brings us back to that picture. Which, when rehung at the end of the film, is a black-and-white close-up of a raging sea. It's reality: more dangerous to deny than to confront (Cynthia and her mother are watercolour fans). She shows it to us three times, in ever tighter crops. It's like looking extinction in the eye. For her third film, she says, she's going for more levity: \"More colour; a bit more life and movement.\" It'll be set in London, rather than en vacances. Again, Hiddleston is likely to feature \u2013 \"We were talking about redemption the other day,\" he says. \"It might be nice to factor that into the mix somehow.\" Hogg is someone of genuine inspiration: both for the quality of her work and the emotional journey that appears to have preceded it. She fights for optimism, even if against experience. We talk about the start of the film, when the family look so happy; about how easy it is to blindly stroll into something unlikely to be other than awful. \"I continually do it myself, not just with my own family but in situations you're hopeful about. But then maybe it's just as well there's some hope at the beginning! And sometimes a situation can stay positive. We want to think good of things. What's the other option?\" Archipelago is released on 4 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
