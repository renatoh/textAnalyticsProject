As you will \u2013 or at least should \u2013 know, it began as a terrifically worthy fundraising initiative for various charities. If challenged, you either stump up $100 or have to pour a bucket of ice cold water over your head. All was fine until various self-publicising celebrities got in on the act. President Obama at least had the graciousness to stump up the dosh, but almost everyone else (and, yes, we mean you Lady Gaga) is treating it as an opportunity for a career boost. After taking the ice bucket challenge and posting a video of themselves doing it on social media, they proceed to nominate others by namedropping their celebrity friends and \u201chumblebragging\u201d about all their Hollywood film and television work. Chris Pratt\u2019s challenge was particularly self-promoting: \u201cI challenge my co-star from Everwood, Gregory Smith; my co-star from Parks and Recreation, Nick Offerman; and my co-star from Guardians of the Galaxy, Dave Bautista.\u201d The only saving grace was his omission of the words, \u201cNow playing at a theatre near you.\u201d \u2022 Don\u2019t tell the Pope, or he really will decide to quit, but if you happen to be hiking along north-west Spain\u2019s famous Way of St James to Santiago de Compostela this summer, look out for the shops offering pilgrims \u201cWay of St James condoms\u201d. The condoms (cond\u00f3nes or preservativos in Spanish, in case you happen to be passing that way) come in jaunty red and yellow single-serving packets, and the box features the silhouette of a (notably lone) hiker. It\u2019s the perfect holiday impulse purchase, because nothing says \u201cCatholic pilgrimage\u201d like novelty prophylactics. \u2022 For Britons who enjoy dressing up in red tunics, getting on a horse and watching their hounds tear foxes to bloody, twitching shreds, the past decade has been utter misery. But with an election imminent, the hunting fraternity reckon their moment has come. The Countryside Alliance\u2019s executive chairman is proclaiming loudly that the Tories will lose half a million votes \u2013 mostly to Ukip \u2013 if they refuse to commit themselves to repealing the 2004 Hunting Act. We \u201cwant and expect\u201d a pledge to reverse the act, he says, before adding that the countryside \u201cdeserves better\u201d. Quite. There\u2019s just one thing: isn\u2019t Sir Barney White-Spunner just a little too obvious a name for a man keen on foxhunting? \u2022 In awkward tweet news, abusive replies to a promoted tweet from the verified Twitter account of the Israeli prime minister are finally starting to die down. The tweet, which invited people to \u201cFollow the prime minister of Israel for news and updates about Operation Protective Edge\u201d has received more than 100 replies \u2013 remarkably few of them polite. No one, though, asked the most pressing question \u2013 who on earth would follow a prime minister for news? Twitter also came under fire for accepting payment for the tweet, but declined to reveal how much @IsraeliPM paid for his sustained week of abuse. \u2022 The architect Cameron Sinclair has introduced an \u201caward\u201d for those people who design bad buildings. \u201cIn the past decade we have seen an explosion of honours and awards for the most innovative and forward-thinking solutions,\u201d he writes on the Dead Prize website. \u201cYet no one recognises the projects that have caused harm to the environment \u2013 designs that are helping shorten our existence on this planet. Let\u2019s recognise the bad, honour the failures and hopefully do something to rectify these designs against humanity.\u201d It could do for architecture what the Bad Sex award has done for English literature. \u2022 If, perchance, you Googled the bakery Greggs today you may have noticed that the tagline on its logo had been changed to \u201cGreggs \u2013 Providing shit to scum for over 70 years\u201d. Greggs says the culprit is not a disgruntled employee, but Google itself. The image, they say, is from a Google+ account, and Google linked the parody picture with the real company in search results.
