The Edinburgh club hold a 3-0 lead going into the match at the Pecara Stadium and, if they progress, they will meet AEK Athens in the third and final qualifying stage next Wednesday. Hearts' manager Valdas Ivanauskas will want his players to conserve energy where possible with an eye on Sunday's visit of Celtic. The Hearts assistant manager John McGlynn said the team's plans for the Scottish Premierleague game will be disrupted, with the players not due back in Edinburgh until 6am tomorrow. \"It is going to be difficult,\" he said. \"Our training will be limited this week because of games and travelling.\" Mirsad Beslija, Hearts' record signing, is travelling despite reports that the club want to offload the Bosnian winger seven months after signing him from Racing Genk. Hearts hope to complete the signing of the Greek defender Hristos Karapidis in the next few days, although he would not be eligible to face AEK. The winger Neil McCann believes the form of Hearts' defence should ensure a smooth passage to the next round. \"One thing we do have is immense confidence in the boys at the back,\" he said. \"They were fantastic last year and have started off the same way this season.\" Siroki Brijeg: (probable, 4-4-2) Basic; Anic, Pandza, Landeka, Silic; Bubalo, Wagner, Carvalho, Ronielle; Karogan, Celson. Hearts: (probable, 4-4-2) Gordon; Neilson, Pressley, Berra, Fyssas; Cesnauskis, Aguiar, Brellier, McCann; Bednar, Pospisil. Referee: V Kassai (Hungary) TV: BBC1 Scotland, kick-off 7.30pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
