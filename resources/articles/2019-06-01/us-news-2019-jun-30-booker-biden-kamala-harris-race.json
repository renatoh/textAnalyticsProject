Booker told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: \u201cWhoever our nominee is going to be, whoever the next president is going to be, really needs to be someone who can talk openly and honestly about race with vulnerability because none of us are perfect, but really call this country to common ground, to reconciliation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if Vice-President Biden is up to that task, given the way this last three weeks have played out, and, frankly, I know whoever is that nominee needs to be able to pull this country together because we need to reconcile.\u201d Biden leads most national and state polls; Booker performed strongly in the first debate this week and is at the rear of the leading pack. Booker, the New Jersey senator, made his remark on Sunday in response a question about a contentious exchange between Biden and Kamala Harris at the second debate in Miami. Harris interjected during a discussion of race and policing, noting that as the only black candidate on the stage, she should be able to respond. She then focused on Biden and attacked his record on race. Campaigning recently, Biden warmly recalled his working relationship with segregationist senators. Opponents pressed him to apologize, but he refused. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris said on the debate stage, as she looked directly at Biden. \u201cBut \u2026 it is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Harris also accused Biden \u2013 who early in his long political career opposed the federally mandated bussing of students as a way to integrate schools \u2013 of propping up policies that would have kept minority students like herself out of majority white districts. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd that little girl was me.\u201d Visibly upset, Biden said \u201cthat is a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true.\u201d Booker, who is African American, told NBC Biden has \u201can inability to talk candidly about the mistakes he made, about things he could\u2019ve done better, about how some of the decisions he made at the time in difficult context actually have resulted in really bad outcomes.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe have one destiny in this nation and right now the vice-president to me is not doing a good job at bringing folks together. In fact, and I\u2019ve heard this from people across the country, he\u2019s causing a lot of frustration and even pain with his words.\u201d Another candidate, Juli\u00e1n Castro, also weighed in, when asked if he thought Harris\u2019s criticism was \u201crelevant\u201d. \u201cOh, of course,\u201d Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and US housing secretary, told NBC. \u201cI think it\u2019s relevant. I think the record of all of the candidates that are running, including Vice-President Biden\u2019s record, is relevant and his stance on busing is relevant as well. \u201cWhat I took as his position being that he allowed local communities to make a decision, essentially relying on states\u2019 rights, I think he\u2019s going to have to continue to explain how that was a good position. Because we\u2019ve had a very painful history in this country of trying to desegregate communities. \u201cThat pain is still there in this country, and he\u2019s going to have to address that \u2013 not only in the debate, but I think going forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
