His new book The Edge of Physics is out now. We dial up researcher and science policy expert Martin Robbins to look at some of the science casualties in last week's UK general election, notably the defeat of Liberal Democrats science spokesman Evan Harris. We also ask whether Britain's first Green Party MP will be good for the environment. In the newsjam, the panel discusses how a lack of sleep might lead to early death; why antifreeze stopped mammoth blood running cold; whether wildlife documentaries should turn a blind eye to the birds and the bees; and why there's a little Neanderthal in nearly all of us. The Guardian's Nell Boase and science correspondent Ian Sample are in the studio. WARNING: contains strong language.
