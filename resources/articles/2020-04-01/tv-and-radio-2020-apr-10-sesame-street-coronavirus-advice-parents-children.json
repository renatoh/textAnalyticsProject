When crisis has struck, Sesame Street has responded, helping children process big emotions about the 9/11 attacks, parents who struggle with addiction or incarceration \u2013 and now, the coronavirus pandemic. Sesame Street is one of the most researched children\u2019s television programs in history, with evidence attesting to the learning gains made by children, particularly young children of color and those living in poverty. About 60 people \u2013 including in-house experts, researchers and production team members \u2013 collaborate to bring a single episode to air. As coronavirus closes at least 124,000 schools across the countryand millions of parents are thrust into the position of full-time caregivers, here is Sesame Street\u2019s advice for parents, teachers and children. \u2018Flexibility is the keyword\u2019 Children thrive on structure and sticking to routine brings them a sense of security, according to Rosemarie Truglio, vice-president of curriculum and content for Sesame Street. Unfortunately, a spiraling health crisis that has overwhelmed hospitals and required families to shelter in place has made it all but impossible to say what\u2019s coming next. So how do parents create routine in an unpredictable moment? \u201cFlexibility is the key word,\u201d said Truglio. \u201cAll children do best with structure, but we also need to be flexible if plans go awry.\u201d The trick for parents, said Truglio, is to stick to the routines that are within control. Keep to night-time rituals like brushing teeth and reading bedtime stories whenever possible. Find regular times for children to focus on schoolwork. Days may feel frantic, but small moments of structure can help create a sense of normalcy. If plans don\u2019t work out, pivot. If it rains, move a picnic to the living room. If you miss a morning reading activity, do it in the afternoon. And just as importantly, let children see that you\u2019re capable of adapting when plans come apart. Handling frustration and disappointment is a crucial piece of child development. \u201cBuilding resilience is key,\u201d Truglio said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long this is going to last. We all have to be resilient.\u201d Embracing everyday moments The good news for parents is that children learn best through everyday moments. In her book Sesame Street: Ready for School! A Parent\u2019s Guide to Playful Learning for Children Ages 2 to 5, Truglio writes about turning everyday tasks into learning moments. Enlisting kids to create a shopping list can be a way to use the alphabet and build vocabulary. Building towers with blocks can mean talking about shapes, width and height. Cooking dinner or doing laundry is a chance to practice math and measurements. A key, said Truglio, is to make learning playful. \u201cLean in and follow your child\u2019s interest,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not good is to do flashcards and rote learning. It\u2019s not very interesting. When children are playing, they\u2019re activated, they\u2019re invested in the learning. When they are trying to solve a problem, they learn through trial and error. They learn not to give up.\u201d Coping with the \u2018for-now normal\u2019 The pandemic is presenting a new kind of trauma, explained Akimi Gibson, vice-president and education publisher at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. \u201cThis trauma is universal. It has no cultural or economic bias. And it caught us all equally by surprise,\u201d Gibson said. . Research attests to the negative impact trauma has on child development \u2013 whether it stems from poverty, a parent addicted to drugs, or a global outbreak. That\u2019s why Sesame Street is leaning into the \u201cfor-now normal\u201d, as the program creators are referring to the moment, by providing tips and resources for talking and listening to children in its recently launched \u201cCaring for Each Other\u201d initiative. \u201cWe have to realize this is a new way to look at trauma\u201d, said Jeanette Betancourt, senior vice-president of Sesame Workshop\u2019s US social impact. \u201cBut most importantly, we need to ask how we can best support children in the most traumatic times, when their voices are often lost.\u201d If you listen closely, children will say what\u2019s on their mind as they narrate their play, Truglio noted. Crucial for caregivers is to listen and help children understand it\u2019s OK to be scared or uncertain. Thankfully, the support children will need to adapt looks a lot like what they have always needed. \u201cVery important to young children are routines, but even more important is knowing that grown ups are there for me. We know what young children need: routine, stability and love. A pandemic doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d Betancourt said. In it together Sesame Street is built around children, but its creators understand that adults need help, too. For them, Sesame Street\u2019s message is simple: understand that you\u2019re human and take a breath. \u201cParents can\u2019t help children if they\u2019re not taking care of themselves. It\u2019s like oxygen on a plane. We want to make sure there\u2019s resources there, but also to be kind to themselves,\u201d Truglio said. For Sesame Street, that has meant providing educators with reliable learning resources at a time when they\u2019re facing a glut of untested tip sheets and guides. For parents and caregivers, it has meant helping them understand they don\u2019t have to become the teacher. \u201cA parent has to be a caregiver, first and foremost,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cAnd the educator wants to maintain a status as teacher. The two are in it together for the interest of the child.\u201d At no point do the makers of Sesame Street say any of this will be easy. But neither did they suggest the future has to be grim. \u201cI hope [people can see] a picture of joy within this moment,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe act of rallying together toward a common goal is not a sad occasion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
