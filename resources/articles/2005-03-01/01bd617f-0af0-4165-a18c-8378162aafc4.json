An achilles injury will ensure the Frenchman's absence, with Dennis Bergkamp, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes and Robin van Persie all suspended. To add to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's despair Robert Pires picked up an ankle injury in Saturday's draw at Southampton, and will now be out for three weeks including the Champions League return against Bayern Munich. In desperation Jeremie Aliadi\u00e8re, who has played only eight minutes of first-team football since injurying his knee ligaments in the Community Shield last August, will definitely play some part. Fredrik Ljungberg is likely to start in support of a sole striker, with 18-year-old Quincy Owusu-Abeyie or 17-year-old Arturo Lupoli competing for that role. With Sol Campbell, Edu and Gilberto Silva also injured, a further reshuffle will see Gael Clichy impersonate a left-winger and either Cesc Fabregas or Mathieu Flamini appear on the right of midfield. Ljungberg played a similarly central striking role, without much success, in last week's defeat at Bayern. \"I've done it at the end of games when it's a bit more open,\" he said. \"Then I enjoy it. But playing up front is probably not my thing. If I get long balls and stuff, like I did at Bayern, then I can't do that much as I'm not that big.\" Both Bergkamp and Reyes earned their suspensions in the first meeting against the Blades, but improved discipline will be required tonight with the home captain Chris Morgan urging his side to again \"get in the faces\" of the Premiership champions. \"When you're playing Arsenal, you have to close them down,\" he said. \"With players of their ability, you cannot stand off them. If you do, it is impossible to stop them. Whatever team they put out, if we stand off them they will pass the ball around us.\" The United manager Neil Warnock is far from confident, despite the visitors' injury concerns. \"The element of surprise has gone for me, which I felt we had when we went down there,\" he said. \"I think it will be 10 times harder to beat them this time than it was at Highbury. Despite their problems, they should still have plenty in their armoury to beat a side of our nature.\" At least Arsenal are not the only side having to cope with injuries. Bayern's influential, if ageing, midfielder Mehmet Scholl will play no part in the German side's match at Highbury next week after he tore a thigh muscle in the 1-0 win at Freiburg at the weekend. Arsenal's hopes of overturning a 3-1 deficit from the first leg will be improved given the 35-year-old's absence even if his likely replacement, Sebastian Deisler, scored the goal. \"I hope things continue like they did on Saturday because I don't want to be sitting on the bench any more,\" he said. The Birmingham City manager Steve Bruce has pleaded for Jermaine Pennant, on loan from Arsenal for the remainder of the season, not to be given a custodial term when he is sentenced for a second drink-driving offence today. \"We've done everything we can to try and put him on the straight and narrow,\" Bruce said. \"He's done wrong and we've all done stupid things when we were younger and he admits that now. You can't describe how stupid he has been but as long as he learns from it, I don't think there is going to be any benefit from sending him to prison.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
