Anyone who doesn't want to farm, apparently. Agricultural training in Britain's colleges and universities has attracted fewer applicants than last year and those who are going don't want to grow food - they want to grow horses or golf courses. Last week's outbreak of foot and mouth disease is only the latest in a long line of disasters that have afflicted British agriculture, sending the industry into crisis. Universities and colleges training people to earn their living off the land have felt the effects. Applications for degree level courses remained stable this year but there are concerns about the quality of applicants. Numbers in agricultural training as a whole are down from last year. \"In 1998-9 there were 103,487 students on land based courses in the UK, we expect that number to be lower for last year. The industry is in crisis, prices are depressed,\" said Richard Winterton director of development services at Lantra, the private charity set up by the Department for Education and Employment to monitor and co-ordinate the agricultural training. That sort of picture might miss the point, according to Howard Petch, the secretary of the National Association of Principal Agricultural Education Officers who represent over sixty educational organisations, including universities like Bath, Bristol, Cambridge and Leeds. \"The numbers applying for some sub-areas are down, but some are up. Agricultural training is no longer just about farming, it includes amenity, landscape, equestrian, environment, pet care, floristry or leisure. In a lot of these areas, numbers are up. One even might have concerns about whether the industry can absorb the numbers coming in,\" said Petch. And there's the rub: raising horses, looking after pets or raising flowers may be popular courses with students, but according to Lantra, they are not necessarily what the industry most needs. Their top priorities are farm management skills and relevant scientific, environmental and technological knowledge. Although agricultural training has diversified enormously in Britain's colleges and universities, Lantra still estimates there are 50,000 too many unskilled workers in agriculture and 38,000 too few graduate level workers. Winterton said, \"people have to be upskilled. We really need to attract, recruit and retain higher qualified new entrants.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
