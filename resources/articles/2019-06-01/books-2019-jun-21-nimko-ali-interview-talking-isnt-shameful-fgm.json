I guard these things with my life'", "bodyText": "There is a Somali phrase, says Nimko Ali, that sums up the paradox of her status both as a survivor of female genital mutilation (FGM) and an activist seeking to eradicate it. \u201c\u2018Bilaa xishood\u2019. It means \u2018Do you have no shame?\u2019 Since the age of seven, when I started talking about my vagina after FGM, I was told that I should be ashamed. But I wouldn\u2019t have been talking about these things if FGM hadn\u2019t happened to me. FGM was the patriarchy\u2019s way of trying to break me and keep me silent, but it made me the loudest person in the room.\u201d As the co-founder of the charity Daughters of Eve and, latterly, The Five Foundation, 36-year-old Ali has devoted herself to campaigning against FGM and gender inequality for nearly 10 years. Her aim is to end FGM by 2030. It is a practice that, according to the World Health Organisation, has affected 200 million women and girls alive today. This goal is ambitious, she says, but achievable. When we meet over coffee in Soho, central London, she has just come from a photo call at Lancaster House for the recipients of the Queen\u2019s birthday honours, in which she has been awarded an OBE. As Ali told the gathered press, her mother would be \u201cboth proud and embarrassed \u2026 The idea that I got my award for talking about my vagina is not something that is celebrated in my community.\u201d Her mother may be similarly uneasy about Ali\u2019s first book What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway), a series of intimate, illuminating and often devastating conversations with women on the subjects of sex, masturbation, periods, pregnancy, the menopause and more. It was initially called Rude, but Ali worried that that would suggest the contents were somehow shocking or indecent. These are conversations, she says, that take place in quiet corners between women but are rarely aired publicly due to fear of judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s not shameful or rude,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just doing what we\u2019ve always been told not to do.\u201d Ali spoke to 152 women across 14 countries in the course of her research; many she encountered through her campaigning. It wasn\u2019t hard to get them to open up since, she says, \u201cevery woman I\u2019ve ever met has a story to tell\u201d. In the end, 42 made it into the book, all of whom appear under pseudonyms. We meet Becky, who is homeless and whose biggest challenge lies in dealing with her periods. Male rough sleepers, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t know the fear of finally having enough money to buy something to eat but worrying about dripping blood on the floor while you wait in line for a bag of chips\u201d. We are introduced to Ayaan, who suffered extreme tearing during childbirth which led to a fistula, causing her family to shun her, and Amina, who struggles to face up to the realities of menopause: \u201cI\u2019ve seen friends crumple at a cancer diagnosis,\u201d says Amina, \u201cnot just because they had a serious illness, it\u2019s more seeing their health and life just disappear in front of them. That\u2019s what I felt. My future was gone in a puff of hormones.\u201d I ask her which subject women found most difficult to discuss? \u201cSexual pleasure, definitely,\u201d Ali replies. \u201cWomen don\u2019t think they have the right to be happy, sexually. Especially empowered women, actually. I think orgasms and sexual pleasure are a human right. I guard these things with my life, though I have learned to become more diplomatic and nicer [to partners], and realise that men have emotions too.\u201d In the book\u2019s introduction, Ali reveals her dislike of the C-word as a pejorative. \u201cI want to reclaim it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cCunts are deep and warm and incredibly magical places where humanity came from, and into which men are trying to return. They want to be hugged by it. But because they\u2019re not always intelligent enough to express that, they want to take it by force. And when you take it by force, it becomes less warm and less hospitable.\u201d Ali isn\u2019t one to mince her words on topics that some might view as difficult or embarrassing \u2013 as she notes in her book, \u201cit\u2019s not very British to talk about fannies\u201d. Perhaps less well known is how funny she is. On politics, she remarks that \u201cpersonally and politically, Tories have been better to my vagina than the Labour party, and I love them for that\u201d. While she\u2019s never voted Conservative, she reveals that she has been known to date \u201ctall Tory men\u201d. For starters, she says, they share childhood trauma. \u201cThey were sent to boarding school at seven and I had FGM. But also there\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re so privileged, that they\u2019ve never needed to fight for anything. People say to me \u2018How could you?\u2019 and I say, \u2018I want someone that comes home and his biggest issue is, \u2018I couldn\u2019t get a seat on the train today.\u2019\u201d By comparison, she finds men on the left of politics exasperating: \u201cThey can\u2019t listen. There\u2019s two things that they can\u2019t understand and that\u2019s when the left is racist and when the left is sexist. They\u2019ll start questioning: \u2018How do you know that\u2019s racist?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Thank you, white guy. You\u2019re asking that because you\u2019ve never felt violated in your life.\u2019 They don\u2019t understand that they are at the top of the pyramid. They\u2019re, like, \u2018I\u2019ve got struggles too\u2019.\u201d I ask her about the Conservative leadership contest and her backing of Boris Johnson, whom she first approached on Putney High Street to talk about FGM shortly after she\u2019d moved to London. She says Johnson listened to her and worked to protect young girls in London when he was mayor. \u201cI saw tribalism almost have my grandfather killed when I was a child because he was vilified for being successful, so I\u2019m not about taking sides,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor me, the personal is political, and there\u2019s nothing more personal to me than my anatomy and those of girls around the world. My loyalty comes from the things that you do, not the tribal things you wear.\u201d The eldest of six siblings, Ali \u2013 who calls Bristol home, but spends much of her time in London \u2013 was born in 1983 in Somaliland. When she was small the family would split their time between her maternal grandparents in the capital Hargeisa (her mother went back to have each of her babies), her paternal grandparents in Manchester, and Dubai, where her father worked in the oil industry. Her early life was immensely privileged. \u201cMy name means \u2018a gift from God\u2019 \u2013 I was a brat. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re the firstborn and the first grandchild, and you get to sleep in a gold cot.\u201d When she was four, they settled in Manchester but then, late in 1988, went back to Hargeisa to stay with her grandparents, as Ali\u2019s mother was heavily pregnant. Ali recalls lots of men coming and going around the house. Later she learned that her grandfather was funding a revolutionary militia preparing to bring down the military regime. One evening, government solders burst into the house and took her grandfather away; the next day they returned to take everyone\u2019s passports. Bombs were falling across the city and Ali remembers her grandmother telling her to stand in the corner of a room to avoid falling masonry. Eventually, they fled the city by hiding in the back of trucks and headed to Djibouti, where Ali\u2019s aunt lived. It was there, at her aunt\u2019s house, that a woman arrived one afternoon wearing what looked like a black burqa \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I didn\u2019t like her. To this day, if I feel uncomfortable with someone, I get up and leave.\u201d Ali ran out of the house and had to be dragged back by her mother. \u201cI had no idea what was going on. I didn\u2019t want to scream, as up until then nothing wrong or harmful had ever come to me at the hands of my parents. When I got back into the house, this woman in black, who was the cutter, started shouting at me.\u201d Ali doesn\u2019t remember anything after this until she woke up hours later with her mother helping her go to the toilet. \u201cThe pain of peeing was beyond anything I\u2019d known,\u201d she recalls. She had undergone the most severe form of FGM, known as infibulation. This means that, as well as being cut, the edges of her vulva had been stitched together to ensure she couldn\u2019t have sexual intercourse \u2013 \u201cto which the obvious response is: \u2018Hello, who is having sex with seven-year-olds?\u2019\u201d. On returning to Manchester, Ali told her teacher what had been done to her, expecting her to be appalled. Instead, she said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s what happens to girls like you. It\u2019s like a bar mitzvah.\u201d The family later moved to a council estate in Cardiff, which was a comedown from their wealthy lifestyle in Hargeisa \u2013 \u201cI went from wearing Lacoste to C&amp;A. It gave me a humbling reality check.\u201d At 11, she collapsed on the school playground from an infection caused by her FGM, leading to her surgical deinfibulation in hospital. She nearly died. After leaving school, Ali studied law at Bristol University, after which she got a job working as a civil servant in public health. While attending a Feminist Society event in 2006, she was asked by a local teacher if she would talk to a group of Somali girls at her school about aspiration. On meeting the girls, Ali discovered that all but one of them were FGM survivors. It was this, along with the birth of her niece, that prompted her to start campaigning against the practice. In 2010 she co-founded Daughters of Eve; three years later, worn out by her dual roles, she finally quit her job. Ali has long made peace with her mother and grandmother about what happened to her. \u201cThis is what was done to them \u2013 we have to understand the patriarchal system in which they lived. I\u2019m still meeting girls today who say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can live without cutting my daughter.\u2019 This is why I fundamentally think that if a woman has had FGM, there needs to be protective mechanisms put in place for when she has a daughter. Because those girls will be at risk.\u201d Writing the book was a cathartic experience during which Ali learned a lot about herself. \u201cFrom hearing about other people\u2019s lives, I realise that I do want kids and I do want to settle down but there are things that I won\u2019t sacrifice. If I wait and I don\u2019t have kids, will I be OK with it? I think I will.\u201d When she finally wins the war against FGM, I ask, what will she do professionally? \u201cAside from opening a B&amp;B?\u201d she laughs. \u201cMy thing is convening unlikely minds. I don\u2019t always work with people I agree with. I punch and hug at the same time. I want to be able to challenge power in a constructive way.\u201d Much of what she does now, she says, is \u201cjust weird\u201d, not least talking to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, or to Barack Obama, about her vagina. She\u2019s proud of her OBE, but it\u2019s nothing next to her pride in the children in her family, who are vehemently anti-FGM, even if they don\u2019t all understand what it is. \u201cThere are 11 girls in my family who haven\u2019t been cut, and that\u2019s more than the women who have been cut. That change in one generation is amazing. It shows us what is possible when the silence stops.\u201d \u2022 What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway) is published on 27 June by Viking.
