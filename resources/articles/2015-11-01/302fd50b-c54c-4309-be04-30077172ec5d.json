In a televised address to the nation, the president said: \u201cWe are and always will be a nation of immigrants.\u201d On Friday, the Obama administration formally asked the supreme court to uphold that action, which would grant protection and work permits to 5 million undocumented immigrants, after a federal court decision left it in limbo, where judgments at state level have placed it. The administration argued that a coalition of Republican-led states had no legal standing to challenge the president\u2019s executive actions and that the president was within his rights to defer deportation for certain groups of immigrants. \u201cIt [the challenge] will force millions of people \u2013 who are not removal priorities under criteria the court conceded are valid, and who are parents of US citizens and permanent residents \u2013 to continue to work off the books, without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families,\u201d the solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, wrote in the filing. On Friday immigration advocacy groups marked the anniversary of Obama\u2019s executive action with rallies near the supreme court and the White House, in which they called on the administration to stop carrying out deportations. Among the protesters were many immigrants affected by Obama\u2019s actions, which protect qualified parents of US-born children and undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children or teens. If the supreme court agrees to hear the dispute, it could re-inject the highly contentious issue into a 2016 presidential election in which immigration is already a highly charged and central issue. The initial challenge to Obama\u2019s executive action was brought by a coalition of 26 Republican-led states, which argued that the president had overstepped the boundaries of his authority by going around Congress and acting unilaterally. A federal judge in Texas placed an injunction on the action in February, temporarily suspending it while the challenge wound its way through the courts. Earlier this month, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals, which sits in New Orleans, upheld the injunction. The Obama administration said then that it intended to appeal. Immigration has become a central issue for candidates in the 2016 election cycle. The Democratic presidential candidates have all announced plans to expand Obama\u2019s executive actions. Republicans have said the actions are an abuse of presidential power and vowed to repeal them. \u201cLatinos are listening, and in 2016 there will be 1.5 million Dapa- [Deferred Action for Parents of Americans] affected US citizen voters who won\u2019t forget who stood in our way and actively sought to deport and separate our families,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project advocacy group. \u201cOur community is strong and ready to hold people accountable and fight for relief.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
