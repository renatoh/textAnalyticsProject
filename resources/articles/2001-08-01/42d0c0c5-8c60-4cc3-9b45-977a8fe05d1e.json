However, the image of retailers' own brand goods being niche products for a small section of shoppers is hopelessly outdated: they now account for more than 45% of UK grocery sales and have been reborn as brands in their own right. Consumer power has brought about the change in how own label goods are marketed, according to research from Datamonitor. Shoppers are no longer motivated purely by price and retailers have developed their own lines in response to the differing needs and preferences of today's consumers. Shoppers have a complex hierarchy of wants and attach different values to a product depending upon the occasion for which it is being bought. This means the average shopping basket is likely to contain a mixture of own label and branded goods; own label brands are no longer bought purely by those wanting to economise. Tesco, for example, segments its customers into value seekers, quality seekers and the mid-market. The mid-market accounts for roughly half its customers and half of its own label sales. But only 20% of own label sales are to value-seeking customers, who make up 30% of Tesco's customer base. This means customers seeking quality actually spend more in absolute terms on own label products. They account for 30% of sales while only making up 20% of the customer base, even though own label products form a lower proportion of their budget. UK retailers have built up a range of own label lines designed to appeal to a range of customer needs and to compete with branded goods. Tesco's \"Healthy Eating\" and Sainsbury's \"Be Good to Yourself\" ranges sit alongside McVitie's \"Go Ahead\" among the low-fat lines, while Tesco's \"Finest\" premium range is a million miles away from the cheap and cheerful price-buster lines. Own label products have evolved to become category leaders for innovation. Earlier this year, the Co-operative Retail Group pulled off a major coup for own label manufacturers when it managed to put its innovative laundry detergent, Brio Actipods, on the shelves before Procter &amp; Gamble's Ariel Liqui-Tabs. The developments in own label products come at a time when traditional in-store and below-the-line promotion are back in vogue. The expense and ineffectiveness of above-the-line advertising has driven manufacturers and retailers to target shoppers as opposed to consumers. P&amp;G's research indicates up to 85% of purchasing decisions are made at the point of sale and can, therefore, be influenced by in-store promotions. Datamonitor's research reveals 84% of people plan which category they intend to buy before visiting a store and 61% of people plan the brand they will buy in advance. But more than 50% of people switch brands in-store because of product availability or in-store promotions. So while PR, advertising and positioning are effective in determining consumers' desires, the shopper's purchasing decisions are largely determined by in-store factors such as choice, display and communication. Today's own label goods can no longer be described as \"humble\" because they are increasingly innovative and appeal to a wide range of consumers. They have turned the tables on branded goods, which must now become more responsive to consumer needs if they are to overcome the competitive advantages of own brands. \u0095 Datamonitor is a business information company specialising in industry analysis.
