Thomas Haden Church and Lauren Graham give stoically professional turns as the kid\u2019s God-fearing, flag-flying, thoroughly heteronormative folks \u2013 you never catch them sniggering \u2013 and director Boaz Yakin pulls off the best (read: only) kids-on-BMXs-defeat-grownups-with-guns finale since The Goonies.
