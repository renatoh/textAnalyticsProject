He focuses on one pivotal episode, Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigeneia as propitiation to Zeus for the war effort, told with characteristic attention to historical detail. It is easy to understand the attraction of rewriting history for a novelist; taking the great mythical or historic figures and humanising them, fleshing out their exploits with emotions, allows the imagination free rein within the comforting structure of an established plot, and here Unsworth is involved in a much more direct retelling than he has been used to, although previous novels such as the Booker-winning Sacred Hunger, or Losing Nelson, have explored historical subjects with the same acute eye. The problem with turning the figures of epic into the characters of a modern novel, with modern sensiblities, is that the novel becomes by definition an extended anachronism, and the novelist needs to make this conscious and overt if it is to convince the reader and avoid seeming as if contemporary concepts or patterns of speech are merely thoughtless or accidental. The corollary of this approach is to introduce an element of burlesque, as TH White did with his Arthurian characters in The Once and Future King. Unsworth has only half achieved this; some of his characters retain the dignity and exotic otherness of their epic past, while others are redrawn as thoroughly modern creations, with the result that there is a lack of conviction in the comedy of the deliberate anachronisms in speech or thought. Ajax voices the need for a 'peace process'; Odysseus wants to 'strike while the bronze is hot'; one soldier calls another 'motherfucker', and Agamemnon's scribe, Chasimenos, sounds like a character from The Office when he publicly thanks the priest of Zeus for building the sacrificial altar: ' \"Croton, who has done a marvellous job. I am sure that all here share my sentiments of gratitude to him for the time he has put in and for his dedication to this project.\" Shouts of \"Hear, hear, well done Croton\" came from various quarters...' By the time Iphigeneia's slave girl is instructed to 'incentivize' her mistress to become a willing sacrifice, the reader must assume that these incongruities are intentional, which then raises the question: why? Because apart from these odd bits of apparently comic dialogue, which blend in with the subtlety of Shakespearean mechanicals, the novel is measured and often beautiful in its descriptions and questions. Through the marginal characters - the Prophet, the Singer, the slave girl - Unsworth paints the rituals, sounds and smells of an ancient culture and muses on the nature of history and destiny. The story takes some time to pick up the pace but as the strands knit together becomes compelling. At one point Odysseus, here a thoroughly unattractive political manipulator, tells the Singer: 'You of all people should know that anything can go into a Song, it just depends on the way you deliver it.' Naturally, his understanding of storytelling is wrong, but there is a sense in which the author should have heeded the Singer's response: 'A Song has the form that belongs to it.' The Songs of the Kings is a fine novel when told straight, but it is marred by the attempts at comic modernisation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
