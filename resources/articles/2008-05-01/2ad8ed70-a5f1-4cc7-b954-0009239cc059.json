That, at least, is how it must look to Sir Alex Ferguson as he seeks to have Manchester United's name added once again to the Champions League roll of honour. Having long since rebuilt the club he inherited in 1986 his demolition of any lingering criticism is overdue. After the bulk triumph of 10 Premier League titles the moment has come to be discerning about the prizes he seeks. There is no attempt to conceal the ever-growing significance of the trophy at stake in Moscow. United, as Ferguson has implied, are a mid-table outfit when the standings of the elite clubs are considered. Real Madrid, winners of the European Cup on nine occasions, are top while Milan, with seven successes, are in hot pursuit. Bayern Munich and Ajax have each taken the trophy four times. The Anfield crowd, of course, have obligingly drawn Ferguson's attention to Liverpool's five nights of ultimate glory in the tournament. United do not measure up, restricted as they have been to raising that hefty piece of silverware on just a couple of evenings, against Benfica in 1968 and Bayern nine years ago. The Scot, in this arena, has performed well below expectations and may still be asking himself how on earth the side got beaten by Bayer Leverkusen in the last four when the 2002 final awaited in his home town of Glasgow. While he has gradually become weary of waiting, Chelsea's impatience is precocious. It took Roman Abramovich's wealth to bankroll the relatively recent aspirations of the club. During the first phase of his ownership the team immediately pressed hard in the Champions League. It mattered excessively in that febrile environment and Claudio Ranieri, perhaps trying too hard to impress his boss and so keep his job, sought to win the away leg of the 2004 semi-final, when Monaco were down to 10 men after a red card for Akis Zikos. Chelsea lost 3-1 and could not rectify the situation at Stamford Bridge. In all but one of the five seasons of Abramovich's ownership, the club has made it to the last four. Statistically that is formidable but the frustration eased only when Chelsea at last got the better of Liverpool at that juncture three weeks ago. Even that was a mere respite from fevered ambition. Avram Grant could never have become manager had he not known precisely what Abramovich wants to hear. So it was that the Israeli floated the notion that the Chelsea squad can appear regularly in future Champions League finals irrespective of what happens in the Luzhniki Stadium. That will make some sort of sense to Abramovich. Why, after all, should he go to such expense for anything else? The futility of seeking to predict his reactions was exposed when, following the parting with Jose Mourinho, a four-year contract was eventually given to Grant. The present manager's position, for all anyone can tell, may turn out to be impregnable no matter how this final turns out but Abramovich would surely be displeased to come off second best. Where else would he rather see his dominance demonstrated than in the capital of his own country? While the causes differ, Ferguson and Abramovich must share a perception that this match has a major part to play in determining the status they hold. The Scot, whose first European trophy came 25 years ago when Aberdeen won the Cup-Winners' Cup, has been on this mission for longer. As the trophies mount up, the tiny group of managers who can compare with or outrank Ferguson will wonder what deeper impact they are having. These people resemble political leaders who yearn to be sure of their \"legacy\". Critics may find Ferguson's conduct distasteful and, at 66, the touchline behaviour at Wigan on the season's final day was no more statesmanlike than in his headstrong past but no one can dispute that his United have played thrilling football. Aided by his assistant Carlos Queiroz, he has come up with modern tactics that still deliver the same entertainment. Ferguson, for a period, could not strike the balance between the traditions of the club and the necessity for a certain pragmatism. He had been at Old Trafford for seven years before he managed the club in the European Cup. United did not hang around then and, in the autumn of 1993, were eliminated on the away goals rule after drawing the first leg 3-3 with Galatasaray at Old Trafford. That sort of result typified the naivety and carelessness that hampered the team repeatedly. The line-up now can, by turns, be buccaneering and pragmatic. Idealism was definitely diluted in the 1-0 aggregate victory over Barcelona in the semi-final. With a relatively young side Ferguson will anticipate further development. The opposition tomorrow are, on average, two years older and some speak as though the Chelsea side will be overhauled if not broken up quite soon. Ricardo Carvalho has anticipated departures and Didier Drogba always sounds restless. The coach Henk ten Cate, for his part, implied that the make-up of the squad had too great an emphasis on pragmatism. Malcontents, all the same, may not be offered terms to equal those enjoyed at Stamford Bridge and the more expressive footballers on the world scene could shun approaches from Chelsea. Grant should be pleased with the resources available to him today. The head-to-head record has been imposing ever since the advent of Abramovich. Losing the league to United last season had no dispiriting effect when Chelsea won the 2007 FA Cup final over Ferguson's team and they are unlikely to be nursing an inferiority complex. As with several entertaining sides, including Arsenal, United seek space by hitting on the break but Chelsea seldom allow themselves to be outnumbered. That discipline and the formidable ability in the ranks means that, for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo usually looks in vain for the liberty he revels in elsewhere. Equally Chelsea know that in Drogba they have a striker who, if his knee trouble is no handicap, may unsettle Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic as barely anyone else can. Ignoring the Community Shield meeting, Chelsea have won seven games and drawn four in 13 encounters with United since the summer of 2003. Misgivings persist over Grant's command of specialised occasions and the Carling Cup final was mishandled as Tottenham enjoyed their rightful victory. That added to the pressure of encounters such as those with Liverpool in the Champions League, when he prevailed where Mourinho had failed. Specifically Grant was then under pressure to show that he could come out on top against United. The win over them last month depended on a late penalty from Michael Ballack but the match as a whole would have reassured the Chelsea players that they have kept their knack of edging out United. Precedents need not be relevant and the \"history is bunk\" principle will appeal to Ferguson but it is up to his team to show that they have the potency to open up a new era. This is a clash that merits the attention it has been awarded. The outcome of the first European Cup final between English clubs will have resonance for years to come.
