Asked whether he expected still to be in charge at St James\u2019 Park in August, Newcastle\u2019s manager smiled before offering a teasing reply. \u201cYou never know,\u201d he said after the 4-1 home victory over Preston North End, who finished with 10 men, had earned automatic promotion. \u201cThat is football. I am really pleased to be here, and really happy and proud for everything we have achieved. Hopefully we can put in the foundations for something that will be a guarantee for the future. The fans have been amazing with me, their loyalty means everything. Having this city behind you means everything; they should have a top team. That is why I decided to stay [after relegation in 2016], and now I am even happier than before that I made this decision. I am really proud and really pleased. \u201cNow is the time to enjoy what we have done. But then I must make sure we do the right things. We have to prepare everything to be strong enough for the Premier League.\u201d For all that the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager wants to remain on Tyneside, he was so disappointed by Ashley\u2019s refusal to strengthen the squad in January that he hinted he could leave this summer. It appears Ben\u00edtez will require cast-iron guarantees of investment levels and spheres of managerial autonomy. Ben\u00edtez then made plain his delight at confounding the doubters. \u201cIt feels really good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of everyone because we knew it would be difficult. At the beginning everyone was saying, \u2018Rafa has no experience of the Championship and it will be tough.\u2019 They were right, it was very difficult but the commitment and hard work of the players every day, and the staff and everyone involved, and then the support of the fans, has made a massive difference. \u201cIt is a day we have to remember because it is not easy to go down and then come straight back up. This is my third promotion [he had two in Spain] so I have some experience. But the Championship is so hard because you have to play so many games and it is so physical. It is very difficult to play three games in a week. \u201cThis division is totally different, you have to change half your squad [after relegation]. You have to perform and win and keep all the fans behind the team.\u201d Ben\u00edtez was at pains to stress it had been very much a collective effort. \u201cWe had to put everything together quickly [last summer] but we did it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I say credit to our players, our staff and everyone in the club. \u201cSome people don\u2019t realise how difficult it is when you go to play against teams who are in the middle of the table and playing for nothing, but they still fight and compete because they are playing against Newcastle United, who are the top side in the division. \u201cOr when they come here with 52,000 fans, and they run and work so hard. It has been like that for every single game against us. We watched some teams and thought it might be easy against them, but then they were running double because they were playing us. It was more difficult than ever, and we have had that situation every single week. That has meant we have had to keep going, work hard and be strong mentally. But even when there were signs of anxiety, we reacted well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
