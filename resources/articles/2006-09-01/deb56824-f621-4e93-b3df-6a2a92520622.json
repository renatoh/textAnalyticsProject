There are supporters at Tottenham Hotspur who rave about him, yet others who cannot see past his flaws. Sven-Goran Eriksson did not want him at the World Cup, and Martin Jol seems unconvinced at White Hart Lane. But the striker is entitled to look at his scoring record, 99 goals in 180 starts, and wonder what he is doing wrong. When Steve McClaren was asked that question yesterday he had nothing but praise for a player he felt should have been in England's 23-man party in Germany. McClaren never shared Eriksson's misgivings and his second match in charge, the Euro 2008 qualifying tie against Andorra, will mark the first occasion that Defoe has started successive games for his country. \"He's always been a player I admire,\" McClaren explained. \"I've told him: 'You've got the shirt now and you've got to make sure you keep it.' He knows I've always liked him. He knows I trust him. It's given him a lift, I believe, to see that the new England manager has the confidence in him to pick him straight away.\" Defoe may not have been among the scorers when the post-Eriksson era was ushered in with a 4-0 win over Greece but McClaren's obsession with computer technology confirmed his opinion that the 23-year-old Londoner had made a telling contribution. The Prozone equipment used by McClaren tells him everything from the distance a player runs to the speed at which he strikes the ball and Defoe's results were among the most impressive. \"The running back he did was incredible,\" McClaren explained. \"His performance showed everyone why he should be in the team.\" Just as impressively, Defoe has handled a difficult summer with impressive dignity. Not once has he gone public with his grievances about Eriksson and the Swede's decision to include Theo Walcott. Lucrative tabloid bribes have dropped through his letter box only to be diverted to the nearest wastepaper basket. \"What I like about him most is the way he has taken the disappointment of summer on the chin and moved on,\" said McClaren. \"I was with him in Germany and I know how hard it was for him. It must have been so tough being on standby and then, just before the tournament starts, having to go home. But he was professional every day he was with us. He worked hard, really hard, and he trained as if he wanted to prove a point. He impressed everyone with his attitude.\" The crux now is whether Defoe can impress McClaren sufficiently for him to keep his place when Wayne Rooney returns from suspension for the home tie against Macedonia on October 7. Andorra should provide a golden opportunity to add to his solitary international goal, scored in a World Cup qualifier in Poland two years ago. More than anything, however, this game offers Defoe the chance to prove a point, not just to McClaren but Eriksson and Jol. One thing he will not be lacking is motivation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
