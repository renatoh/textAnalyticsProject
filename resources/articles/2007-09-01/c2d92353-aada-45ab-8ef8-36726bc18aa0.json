The current so-called \"golden generation\" would have fancied a smoother run-up than being beaten by Scotland and edging out Italy thanks to a decidedly ropey try. How they see it \"It was a wake-up call,\" said Eddie O'Sullivan of that snoozy display against the Italians. With France and Argentina in the pool, and presumably already awake, progress suddenly seems rather tricky. The coach A four-year contract extension a week before the World Cup is some vote of confidence; O'Sullivan has ridden the rough waters that go with coaching the Irish team far better than Brian Ashton, for one. The captain Brian O'Driscoll will be missed as he recovers from the damage done by a Bayonne fist in a recent \"friendly\". He'll be back to face France and for the possible pool decider against Argentina in Paris. The linchpin Without O'Driscoll, Ireland will rely more than ever on Ronan O'Gara. The Munster fly-half has the tactical brain and calm needed to run and win Test matches. How they'll play Fire and brimstone up front, skill and speed behind. Revert to slightly frenetic type under stress. Key fact Flanker Simon Easterby is married to Sarah Elgan Rees, the Welsh-speaking, TV-presenting daughter of 1980 Lions wing Elgan Rees. Omen The Sugababes were No1 with Hole In The Head when Ireland beat Argentina in 2003. New single About You Now is released a week before the match on September 30. World Cup odds 16-1 The tactics Ireland's game plan revolves around Ronan O'Gara, their much-improved fly-half. First he does the basics, getting Ireland into opposition territory with raking tactical kicks backed up by a brilliant lineout. That used to be when Brian O'Driscoll took over, but now O'Gara has learned that the threat of O'Driscoll is often enough to beat defences. In the diagram he threatens to go wide before using a \"no look\" shoulder ball to put the blindside winger through the hole created by a drifting defence that has one eye on the Irish captain.
