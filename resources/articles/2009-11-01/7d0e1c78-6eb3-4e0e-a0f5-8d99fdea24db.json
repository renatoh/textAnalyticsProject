Even before Abdullah's emotional announcement in front of thousands of supporters, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, insisted a withdrawal would not undermine Saturday's election runoff. \"I don't think it has anything to do with the legitimacy of the election,\" Clinton told reporters in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. \"It's a personal choice... We see that happen in our own country where, for whatever combination of reasons, one of the candidates decides not to go forward.\" In a statement released by the US state department last night, Clinton, who was on her way to Morocco, praised Abdullah for running a \"dignified and constructive\" campaign, but said it was up to Afghan officials to decide the way ahead after his withdrawal. She said the US would support the next Afghan president and the Afghan people and that Afghan officials had to conclude the electoral process in a way that was in line with the Afghan constitution. A senior White House adviser said the muddled election would not complicate the US administration's strategy, although Barack Obama has already delayed a decision on whether to send extra troops pending the outcome of the election. \"We're going to work with the leader of the Afghan government and hopefully that's going to create the state of conditions for the people of Afghanistan, and also help us as we try to bring this war to a close,\" Valerie Jarrett told ABC's television This Week news programme. But she did not reject suggestions that the electoral confusion had led to a delay in Obama's decision, saying that the president was \"going though a very vigorous process. Before he puts our men and women in harm's way, he wants to make absolutely sure he has a strategy.\" Obama has been accused of dithering as he deliberates on a request by his top commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, for at least 40,000 more troops. John Boehner, the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, said on CNN's State of the Union: \"The longer this decision hangs, the more jeopardy and the more danger our troops on the ground there are in the middle of. I would hope the president would make a decision and make it soon.\" The election was supposed to have provided the US with a solid and credible partner as it prepared to unveil a new strategy to counter a resurgent Taliban. Instead, the US and Britain now find themselves saddled with a government of questionable legitimacy while public opinion in both countries is turning against the war. Gordon Brown alluded to President Hamid Karzai's shortcomings in comments to reporters on Abdullah's withdrawal, which he said had been done \"in the interests of national unity\". He said: \"What is going to happen is we have got to have a visible sign that the new administration is tackling corruption... We have got to know that they are going to bring greater prosperity to the Afghan people and they have got to have an army and police that is capable of keeping order in Afghanistan so that our troops and other troops can, over time, come home.\" But the former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said Abdullah's withdrawal compounded problems for the west by undermining Karzai's legitimacy. \"Public support on both sides of the Atlantic for any additional deployment of troops must depend on confidence in the government of Afghanistan,\" Campbell said. \"By giving Karzai a free run, Abdullah has done nothing for that confidence.\" The Taliban said Abdullah's withdrawal made no difference. \"There will be no change of policy as far as we are concerned,\" a Taliban spokesman, Qari Mohammad Yousuf, told Reuters.
