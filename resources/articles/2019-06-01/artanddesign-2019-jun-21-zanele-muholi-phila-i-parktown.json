But Muholi is playful with it. Domestic goddess \u2026 The poses are the stuff of classic portraiture but the props are not: wire scourers and clothes pegs fashioned into headdresses and jewellery. Typically staring us straight in the eye, Muholi summons the shades of black history and identity. The humble materials point to household servitude. Handy work \u2026 In this 2016 photo, the black latex gloves suggest cleaning but also fetish, playing games with restrictive categories. Gloves, with their suggestively inflated pregnant hollows and phallic fingers, blur binary definitions of gender. On the record \u2026 The dark lionesses are a recent development. Muholi\u2019s earlier series have included portraits of people from South Africa\u2019s LGBTQI communities. Included in Kiss My Genders, Southbank Centre: Hayward Gallery, SE1, to 8 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
