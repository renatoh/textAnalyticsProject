Gemili, who has been warm-weather training in Qatar after recovering from the hamstring tear that forced him to miss the world championships, said he hoped the World Anti-Doping Agency would expand its investigations to other potential black spots following the publication of Dick Pound\u2019s report. \u201cI read that document and it said there were other countries as well so there\u2019s a lot more investigation that needs to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t think it has just been going on with Russia but that\u2019s for them to get out there and sort out.\u201d Gemili, the only British athlete to run under 10 seconds for the 100m and 20 seconds for the 200m, also urged fans not to \u201close faith\u201d in track and field despite the problems that have rocked the sport to its foundations in recent weeks. \u201cI train so hard every day I know what work I put into it so it\u2019s a shame when people think the sport isn\u2019t credible anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the big names, Usain Bolt who\u2019s a clean guy and leading the sport, saying this is what we can do clean. Don\u2019t give up faith in the sport. That\u2019s why I think it was extremely important him winning in Beijing.\u201d Gemili, who yesterday graduated with a 2:1 in sports and exercise science from the University of East London, admitted he would like to see other countries adopt the UK Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s rigorous testing model. \u201cWe get tested so often in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone is doing it, it\u2019s very difficult to get away with it. You would like to think that is happening across the globe in every country. Unfortunately it\u2019s not. That\u2019s down to the IAAF and Wada to actually put that into place and make sure every time I\u2019m getting a knock at the door, someone in other countries is also getting tested just as much.\u201d Gemili also backed Sebastian Coe to turn athletics\u2019 fortunes around, despite the corruption inquiry by French police into former members of the IAAF. \u201cSeb\u2019s been under a lot of fire,\u201d Gemili said. \u201cBut I know what he\u2019s like and how passionate he is about athletics. I have a lot of faith in him and I believe he will \u2013 as best as he can \u2013 clean up the sport.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
