Mr Blair's speech is designed to open a swath of pre-election policy announcements, showing Labour will quickly build on what he admitted had been the slowly built foundations of the first term. The over-arching aim, he claimed, of an unprecedented second term Labour government would be to create a meritocratic society in which the barriers to upward mobility were dismantled. Mr Blair openly conceded the primary purpose in his near complete first term had been to improve the economic fundamentals and reassure voters the party would not reproduce the political and strategic errors of previous Labour governments. With this reassurance phase now over, Labour could, with a series of 10-year plans and, by implication, a third term - govern on its own terms - building a meritocratic society and breaking down the barriers to social mobility. Mr Blair made little direct reference to the Conservatives, but William Hague said that if Mr Blair was given 100 years in government he would still fail to deliver. Mr Hague insisted the real issue facing people was the preservation of the pound after Mr Blair had vowed to decide within two years of the next election whether to call for Britain to join the single currency. Mr Blair - with a 21% lead in the latest Gallup poll out today - ignored the euro in favour of his domestic agenda. \"Opening up economy and society to merit and talent is the true radical second term agenda\", he said in a speech at a school in Enfield, north London, built through the private finance initiative. He went on: \"Having defined ourselves as a party of competence and modernity, it is time for a second phase of New Labour, defined less by reference to the old Labour party, than by the agenda for the country, radical, but firmly in the centre ground.\" Mr Blair's attempt to set out a vision of an open society, likely to be put to the test of the electorate on May 3, will face the opposition challenge that similar grand visions in the 1997 election have led to disappointments. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, described the speech as a clear sign of the vacuum at the heart of New Labour. \"It was a definitive speech, and the definition lacks definition.\" Mr Blair tried to pre-empt this attack by conceding that government had been more difficult than he had first imagined, and that for many people life remained a real struggle - \"uncertain , insecure and under constant pressure\". Trying to blend this humility with vision, he said: \"Though hardened by the setbacks of government, though more realistic about how long it takes to change big institutions, we remain bold in our ambitions of our country.\" Aware that Labour must assure a strong turnout from its traditional supporters to prevent a big cut in its overall majority, Mr Blair also promised his government would be more than technocrats and instead pursue the ideal of a fairer society. Returning to the theme of education on which he was first elected, Mr Blair promised a radical overhaul of the failed comprehensive system by doubling the number of specialist schools within five years, so that four in 10 secondary schools would be outside the comprehensive system. The Budget, which is likely to be on March 6, will also include extra money for schools, bringing state funding per pupil closer to that of the private sector. Although the government is keen for academic institutions to take on more students, it has been unwilling to commit more money to the sector. Apart from reform of the criminal justice system, Mr Blair also promised measures to create an American-style entrepreneurial culture, with greater competition, less regulation and an end to the stigma of bankruptcy. He will issue a white paper on building technology start-ups in universities on the US model. Mr Blair also signalled a new warmth to public sector workers, claiming he wanted to give them new powers. He wanted \"doctors, police officers and teachers to become the social entrepreneurs of the future as important as any businessman or woman. Thatcherism allowed better rewards for those that did rise to the top but in fact social mobility between the classes has barely increased or even, in some parts, declined. There was no land of opportunity for all,\" he said. The teaching unions responded by demanding extra money. Points for a second term \u0095 Overhaul comprehensive system by doubling the number of specialist schools to 1,500 by 2006. \u0095Open up top universities with \u00a318m fund to increase students from state schools. \u0095Pledge to ensure that more than half of under 30-year-olds go to university by 2010. \u0095Attack on adult illiteracy. \u0095\u00a31,000 savings account for every newborn child to help less well-off. For each \u00a31 parents placed in the account, government would offer \u00a32. \u0095Open markets to competition and end stigma of bankruptcy. \u0095Round-the-clock routine operations to increase NHS efficiency. \u0095Step up the war on crime. Crime plan later this month will set out root-and-branch reform of every aspect of the criminal justice system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
