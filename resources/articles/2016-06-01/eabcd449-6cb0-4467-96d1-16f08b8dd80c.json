From 20 June, the Carlisle-based CN Group will distribute a title called 24 - The North\u2019s National across a swathe of the north west region, running south from the Scottish border county of Dumfries and Galloway to Preston, Lancashire. Some 95% of the editorial content for the 40-page paper will be drawn from the Press Association, which issued the press release announcing the launch. The cover price for the Monday-to-Friday title has been set at 40p. An inside source said: \u201cIt will be part Metro, part i, and it will serve a whole region untouched by Metro. In newspaper terms, this is a disenfranchised area. The costs for CN are minimal so it\u2019s a low risk experiment to test whether there is an audience.\u201d It is estimated that the circulation area, which includes much of Cumbria and Lancashire plus Hexham in Northumberland, Lockerbie in Scotland and down the M6 corridor to Preston, has a population of 1.15m adults. Like Metro and the i, it will aim to be politically-neutral. A digest of national stories, alongside lifestyle features and celebrity gossip, will be supplemented by \u201cregionally-focussed columns\u201d and sport relevant to the area. Football teams such as Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Everton, and Newcastle United will be covered along with Glasgow\u2019s two major teams. CN Group, which publishes the North West Evening Mail and the Cumberland News, will capitalise on the established distribution of those titles through Menzies. The content will have an online life too: \u201824\u2019 national news sections will appear on the group\u2019s websites. Miller Hogg, CN Group\u2019s chief executive, said the new paper \u201cwill fill a large gap in the regional market by providing a northern take on the national headlines.\u201d He said: \u201cWe see our purpose as serving the communities in which we operate, so it follows that CN Group should produce a national newspaper tailored to our patch. \u201cOur collaboration with PA will ensure our readers receive only the highest quality journalism which delivers the facts devoid of spin.\u201d PA\u2019s managing director, Tony Watson, said the agency \u201cwill work closely with the editorial team at \u201824\u2019 to provide a package of the news and content of most interest to its readers.\u201d \u201824\u2019 will be edited by Mike Haworth, who has previously held senior editorial positions at the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star. CN Group\u2019s editorial director David Helliwell said: \u201cAfter so much doom and gloom for the industry this is an exciting new development. \u201cWe believe we have the right package of content and design, spiced with a distinctly northern flavour, to provide a viable alternative in the national newspaper market.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
