Since he tidied up his affairs before becoming prime minister, it\u2019s no surprise that his returns show no obvious signs of offshore shenanigans. The last time he received any dividends, which may or may not have come from offshore companies, was in 2010-11, when he received just \u00a3114. What the returns do show, however, is just how financially \u201clucky\u201d Cameron is, as he admitted last week. On top of his prime ministerial salary, Cameron and his wife, Samantha, \u201cearned\u201d \u00a3430,800 (after expenses) from renting out their \u00a33.5m west London home in the five years up to March 2015. At a rate approaching \u00a3100,000 a year, the couple will by now have cleared more than half a million pounds since arriving in 10 Downing Street. Not much room for the PM to argue he\u2019s not part of the \u201crentier\u201d class. As the Downing Street accommodation is rent-free, this is a major boon to the Cameron household finances. Unsurprisingly, the prime minister was at pains to point out that since 2011-12, he has not taken the benefit of a little-known \u00a320,000 extra tax \u201cprime ministerial expenses deduction\u201d that was available to him (having been introduced under the postwar Attlee government). His way of going about this looks slightly odd, though. For three years he claimed the relief but cancelled it out by declaring the same amount as income that he didn\u2019t actually have, which looks strictly incorrect. Few would have expected the story at the end of the week to be that David Cameron had overstated his income for tax purposes. He did, however, take the allowance in 2010-11 (when it was worth around \u00a38,000 to him), even though he and Samantha were already bringing in \u00a360,000 in rent, which might not impress those who are losing housing benefits under the so-called \u201cbedroom tax\u201d that he was soon to impose. The prime minister\u2019s finances have suffered from the low interest rates he and other world leaders have been forced to introduce. Interest on his savings account fell from \u00a36,681 in 2013-14 (by which time the \u00a3300,000 inheritance from his late father appears to have arrived) to \u00a33,052 the following year. That\u2019s maybe one upmarket break in Lanzarote rather than two. It\u2019s not all hardship, though. The prime minister\u2019s own party supports him where necessary, the returns reveal. Expenses met by the Conservative party have varied between \u00a35,105 and \u00a313,149, which have been declared as taxable benefits. They cover travel, clothes and other associated expenses for Cameron and his wife. When the PM next berates Jeremy Corbyn over a shabby suit, the Labour leader will be able to reply that, unlike Cameron, he isn\u2019t receiving a subsidy for it from the party. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 April 2016. An earlier version referred to a taxpayer, rather than the party, subsidy for David Cameron\u2019s suits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
