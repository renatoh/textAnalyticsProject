The death of Jeremy McDole is being investigated by officials from the Delaware Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust. The department reviews every incident in which a police shooting results in injury or death. McDole, 28, was shot on Wednesday by several Wilmington police officers who were responding to a 911 call reporting that he had shot himself, according to authorities. The graphic cellphone footage, filmed by a bystander, shows an officer approaching McDole on a street and shouting at him to put up his hands and drop a gun. A gunshot can be heard and a person behind the camera says McDole was struck and bleeding. Several other officers then join and make their own commands while McDole struggles in his wheelchair and moves his hands. At that point, McDole appears to move to reach into the front of his jeans, just before several officers open fire. No gun, other than those belonging to the officers, is visible in the video footage. Police said on Thursday they had recovered a .38-caliber handgun that they said had been at his side. McDole lived in a nearby nursing home, according to the Associated Press. Family members told local media that he had been using a wheelchair since he was shot and paralyzed at the age of 18. His uncle, Eugene Smith, was among a crowd who gathered at the scene of the shooting on Thursday, the AP reported. \u201cIt was an execution,\u201d Smith reportedly said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was. I don\u2019t care if he was black, white, whatever.\u201d Wilmington police chief Bobby Cummings and mayor Dennis Williams gave an update on the response to the shooting at a press conference in the city on Thursday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the officers and family of Jeremy McDole, as this encounter unfortunately ended with the loss of his life,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cI know that this incident could impact police and community relations, therefore, I will ensure a thorough and transparent investigation will be conducted.\u201d Investigators from the state justice department responded to the scene of the shooting Wednesday to interview witnesses. Williams promised that a \u201cbetter grasp of the details\u201d of what happened would be established. \u201cThis is a sad and unfortunate situation for everyone involved,\u201d said Williams. A spokeswoman for Williams said the four officers involved in the shooting had been placed on administrative leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
