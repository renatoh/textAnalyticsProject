And another who would stop an interview to look at a young girl walking by and make comments about her appearance. Or the ministerial adviser who has never spoken to you but who\u2019s desperately keen to get your telephone number so he can compliment you on what you\u2019re wearing. I\u2019m a political journalist and I, too, have suffered these misplaced \u2013 at best \u2013 and blatantly sexist \u2013 at worst \u2013 remarks, often made under the pretext of humour or pseudo-seduction \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise. Sometimes they\u2019re disguised as compliments, at which point I go as red as a poppy and wish the ground would open up and swallow me. Such comments are mortifying and I feel put in my place: that of a woman who should remain inferior and silent. Sometimes, I\u2019ve even avoided calling back sources because I\u2019m afraid that my motives might seem ambiguous and misconstrued, and I don\u2019t want to risk that. I\u2019ve also avoided some late-night meetings with political contacts for the same reason. No, it\u2019s not \u201csystemic\u201d. No, nothing that I\u2019ve suffered is illegal or could be the subject of a legal complaint, and no, it\u2019s no different from what millions of women in France, many of them in a much more difficult situation than me, a staff journalist, suffer every day. Nor does it stop me doing my job. It does make me feel that it\u2019s impossible for me to do my job in the same way as my male colleagues. It is always in my mind and it sometimes puts me in a weak position, which I resent. This everyday sexism is the same for my female colleagues and we recently explained this in an open letter published by the daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration. It was titled \u201cWe are female political journalists and victims of sexism\u201d and was signed by 40 journalists from different media. We have talked about it for a long time. We\u2019ve sighed, we\u2019ve complained, but until now we have never crossed the line and expressed our complaints publicly and collectively. The idea of the newspaper declaration came about this winter during a chance conversation, but more and more colleagues joined our cause and each would tell us another anecdote. The sexism came from across the political spectrum and at every level of power, from government minister to member of parliament. The accumulative effect of these stories of political sexism was astonishing, even to me. I knew that it was present in the political world but the constant, relentless and sometimes violent nature of what some of us have endured took my breath away. It was proof that the problem is structural and not the work of a few vulgar males or isolated incidents, as is often claimed. In our Lib\u00e9ration tribute, we told how one MP greeted a woman journalist at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, with the words: \u201cAh, but you\u2019re hustling \u2026 are you waiting for a client?\u201d Another journalist said an MP would pass his hand through her hair and make remarks about how he couldn\u2019t wait for the return of spring. Some would only desist if threatened with a legal complaint of harassment. A colleague recalled that a candidate for the presidential primaries said he had agreed to answer her questions because \u201cshe was wearing a pretty dress\u201d. During one very speedy visit to a factory where we were asked to wear blue overalls, one minister thought it funny to say: \u201cIt would be better if you weren\u2019t wearing anything underneath.\u201d Another time, after the summer holidays, a ministerial adviser asked us if we were \u201ctanned completely all over\u201d. Several female colleagues told of the text messages proposing: \u201cInfo in exchange for ap\u00e9ro [a drink]\u201d. During the last presidential campaign, some female reporters discovered that a political aide had photographed them asleep on a plane and had shared the picture with his colleagues. We know that not only journalists suffer. It exists everywhere in society. In the street, the M\u00e9tro, at work. In politics, elected women suffer. Last year, in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, a woman MP was interrupted by a male MP who made cluck-cluck noises like a chicken when she spoke. A female minister was whistled because she was wearing a flowery dress. Women working at the Assembl\u00e9e have told us \u2013 anonymously, because they are afraid of losing their jobs \u2013 that politicians have tried to seduce them, sometimes violently, in a lift or corridor. Others reported that when they turned up for a job interview in an MP\u2019s office, he had set up a makeshift bed. Of course, not all French MPs behave like this. Happily, some respect the rules of a working relationship, and even respect the understandable closeness that can exist between a politician, adviser or official, and a journalist. Across all political parties, younger MPs seem better educated in equality. Perhaps it\u2019s a question of generations, but I\u2019m ready to bet that if nothing changes in French political life that in a few years\u2019 time, when these young men become ministers and intoxicated with power, they will repeat the behaviour of their elders. As long as women are very much in the minority in the Republic\u2019s corridors of power and mostly white, heterosexual men, often in their sixties, dominate the two houses of parliament, they will continue to cultivate the behaviour and the sexist codes of an old boys\u2019 club. Unless. Well, unless the balance of power shifts. Four years ago, the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair came as a shock to France, including in some newspaper offices, where stories emerged of female journalists who would try not to interview the head of the IMF alone. Suddenly, we were free to speak. But decades of machismo are not so easily or instantly crushed. We have to continue to fight and go further. Female journalists must speak out, talk about how they are treated and shame those MPs who persist in their sexist behaviour. Like the German journalist from Stern who wrote in her profile of the liberal Rainer Br\u00fcderle that he had vaunted the merits of her d\u00e9colletage. Perhaps that\u2019s our next step. Because in 2015, female journalists just want to get on with their jobs.
