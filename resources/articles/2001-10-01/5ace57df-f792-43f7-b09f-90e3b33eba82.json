Here was a New Yorker with a multicoloured afro and bizarre taste in clothes, singing about murder and alien abduction. She spent her interviews discussing her love for marijuana and the British indie band Muse. Aside from the musical strength of her debut album, Kaleidoscope, part of Kelis's appeal lay in the fact that no army of record company executives could possibly have contrived such an artist. You couldn't make her up. Two years on, and Kelis seems no closer to being subsumed into the R&amp;B mainstream. Her second album opens with a parody of the syrupy spoken-word introductions favoured by R&amp;B divas. \"Welcome to the world of Kelis,\" yawns a bored voice. \"Don't touch anything!\" Her lyrics are equally striking. The superb Flashback subverts standard bump-and-grind cliches with intriguing imagery. \"Early in the morning the thought of sex is soaring like a plane,\" she coos, simultaneously sexy and rather puzzling. The distinctive, futuristic sound of Kaleidoscope also acted as a calling card for production duo the Neptunes. Chad Hugo and Kelis's on-off boyfriend Pharrell Williams have gone on to produce major hip-hop stars, including Jay-Z and P Diddy, but Wanderland is their most adventurous work to date. Occasionally, their experiments don't work. Perfect Day, featuring ska-punk band No Doubt, attempts to update Funkadelic's 1970s blueprint of soul smothered in distorted rock guitars, but ends up sounding distressingly like Limp Bizkit. More frequently, however, the music on Wanderland is clever, exhilarating and original. Popular Thug features Rogers and Williams sparring over the honking of what sounds like a steam-driven synthesizer. The sparse, abstract stammering of Get Even creates an aura of anxiety, the perfect foil for the song's snarling lyric. Single Young Fresh 'n' New is largely based around the squealing of a car alarm. Buried at the end of the CD are not one, but two hidden tracks. The second is a cover of Phil Collins's 1980s AOR nightmare I Don't Care Anymore. In the hands of Kelis and the Neptunes it becomes a seething, distorted slab of rage. It's thrilling, surprising and faintly disconcerting - much like Wanderland, and the 22-year-old who made it. To hear this CD, call 09068 626828 and use code 1298*.
