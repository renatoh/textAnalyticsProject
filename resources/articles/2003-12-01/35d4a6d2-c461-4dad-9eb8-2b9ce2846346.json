The British team coach has told them that, unlike previous seasons when they have been protected from internal trials, they will be thrown into the pot of national squad rowers, where they will compete against each other, as well as their team-mates, in a series of special races. \"I'm sure that we'll take these races in our stride,\" Pinsent said. The trials will be held at Eton's 2,000-metre course on February 12 and will allow Grobler to see whether Pinsent or Cracknell might go faster with another partner. Privately, Grobler believes that the two men are likely still to be Britain's best com bination, but since the top boat's lowly fourth-place finish in the world championships, behind Australia, he can no longer be sure. Grobler is also determined to show no favouritism within the squad. \"Everyone has been training very hard over the last three months and it's been very competitive,\" he said. The treatment of Britain's two top rowers contrasts dramatically with that of their great rivals from Australia, Drew Ginn and James Tomkins. This month the Australian selectors rolled out a red carpet along their top pair's road to Athens by guaranteeing them Olympic selection. Pinsent and Cracknell have consistently notched up the top two scores on the rowing ergometers this season. However, it is another matter on the water. The two men have hardly rowed a stroke in their pair since August and at the recent long-distance sculling trials Cracknell was beaten into second place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
