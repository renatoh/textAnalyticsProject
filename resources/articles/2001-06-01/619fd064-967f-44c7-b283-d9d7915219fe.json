Most people look forward to a rest; but others, who fear relaxation (and time with the family), will feel agitated As the holiday draws close. One in four self-employed workaholics took no holiday last year, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development - a sign that they are uncomfortable outside work. If you are anxious, ask yourself why. Perhaps you are frightened of relaxing in case you cannot restart. 2 Plan ahead - especially if you have to clear your desk. It is easier to squeeze seven weeks' work into six weeks than two into one. 3 Think of things that could go wrong while you are away and pre-empt them. It could just be that you paint your name on your chair so you don't feel homeless when it is missing on your return. But you may also need to delegate if there are bigger issues. 4 Remember that even the most popular people are vulnerable in their absence. It is human nature to blame the person who isn't there for any disaster. Colleagues can talk more freely about unpopular bosses when there is no chance of them walking in - and they can find better ways of doing things if those bosses haven't kept up with the times. 5 Don't expect perfection, says occupational psychologist Michael Carroll. Many couples and families have rows on holiday - but this is natural, he says: 'You could be just making up for the missed rows you were too busy to have before.' Holidays have the same challenges as the rest of life; golden beaches and laughing children will, in reality, be accompanied by sunburn and car breakdowns. 6 Expect to be thrown off balance on the first day or two, suffering withdrawal symptoms from your usual routine. 'You won't be able to disengage psychologically on the first day,' says Carroll. The ideal holiday is probably three weeks: disengage in week one, relax in week two and rev up again in the last week. Since such long breaks are rare, understand why you may occasionally feel disorientated. 7 Try to avoid mimicking your work patterns - do not arrange museum visits as if they were business appointments. Try to live in the present, not the future. Experiment. Read novels. Dance. Do anything you would not often do back in Surbiton.
