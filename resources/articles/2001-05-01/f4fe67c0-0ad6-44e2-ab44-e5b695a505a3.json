Gordon Brown, soon to be reinstalled at the treasury after masterminding Labour's campaign, makes some pointed, and pertinent, criticisms of the European Central Bank and is studiously ignored. In a sense, this is only to be expected. Maggie saying \"never ever\" to the blue-rinse brigade in Plymouth has sex appeal for a media utterly sick of arguments about whether the Tories can find \u00a38bn in spending cuts and whether Labour is planning to raise national insurance contributions. The mummy's return had all the ingredients - the defiant blast from the lost leader, the off-message soundbite, the cutaway shots to the party faithful in raptures at the show of defiance. Mr Brown extolling the virtues of the Bank of England's symmetrical inflation target and his willingness to defy the European Commission by funding investment through borrowing is, by contrast, a total turn-off. Who out there among the great, bored, apathetic electorate knows or cares what the difference is between our symmetrical inflation target and the inflation ceiling in operation in the single currency zone? Even so, the chancellor's comments are by far the more signficant, not in the context of the next couple of weeks but in the context of the next couple of years. Lady Thatcher's intervention is all sound and fury, signifying nothing; Brown's careful sideswipe at the ECB matters a great deal, since it is an indication of how the single-currency issue may develop under a second Blair government. All the attention so far has been on the Tories and Europe, but the really fascinating question is what Labour plans to do once it wins, and wins big, on June 7. Brown's approach to the election campaign has long been planned. Labour would first show that it was competent to manage the economy, then use the fruits of growth to deliver hefty increases in public spending. The Conservatives would be challenged to match the spending or say how they would fund tax cuts. Nothing, least of all a protracted row about monetary union, would be allowed to muddy the waters. So far, the softly-softly ap proach to the single currency has been vindicated. There were those who doubted whether the formula drawn up in 1997 - yes in principle, but only once five economic tests had been met - would stand up to the scrutiny of an election campaign. Yet it has not been Labour's line on the euro that has been tested but the Conservative policy of ruling out membership of the euro for only one parliament that has looked increasingly threadbare. It is because the single currency has been defused as an electoral issue that the prime minister is able to make his speech today arguing that there is no contradiction between patriotism and support for Europe. The real question, however, is what happens next. Throughout the campaign, enthusiasts for early UK entry have comforted themselves that the government's silence on the euro is purely tactical. Those cabinet ministers, such as Robin Cook and Stephen Byers, who believe there is a strong case for British membership have been disciplined in parroting the line that the five tests are not only sacrosanct but meaningful. But expectation is that a victory on June 7 will see the launch of a referendum campaign on June 8. This may still happen. After all, Labour said nothing about giving the Bank of England independence to set interest rates during the 1997 campaign and then proceded to do so four days after the election. Moreover, there are those in the party who believe that Labour's big mistake in the aftermath of the landslide four years ago was to duck the question of entry into the euro. There will be pressure on the prime minister and the chancellor not to delay second time around. Under this scenario, the government would say within a couple of months that all the tests have been passed, thereby clearing the decks for a referendum in the autumn of 2002. But Brown's comments yesterday suggest he is in no particular hurry. He can see the arguments for British membership of the single currency, but he is also aware that the euro is weak and getting weaker, that British public opinion is strongly antagonistic, and that the combination of the Queen's jubilee next year and the turbulence likely to arise from introduction of euro notes and coins in January might make 2002 a less than perfect time for a referendum. The chancellor's argument is that the economics of monetary union have to be right, not just for one year but permanently, if Britain is to join. And that will require a change in the way Europe approaches both monetary and fiscal policy. The fact that Brown believes bad economics makes for bad politics does not rule out a referendum early in the next parliament. But it doesn't necessarily mean there will be one either.
