Robbie Keane had put Spurs in control with a 13th Premier League goal of the season that left goalkeeper Joe Hart with no chance but the hangover of their Uefa Cup defeat on penalties to PSV Eindhoven in midweek appeared to set in after the break, and City showed the greater desire to take all three points thanks to Ireland's predatory leveller and Onuoha's first goal for the club. With the hosts eleven points adrift of fifth-placed Everton and Tottenham already qualified for next season's Uefa Cup as a result of their Carling Cup win, there was little at stake for either side in this contest. Tottenham began brightly enough with Keane spurning the first chance of the match after just three minutes. Alan Hutton fed the forward down the right channel and the Irishman cleverly flicked the ball over Onuoha, before opting for an ambitious shot from an impossible angle rather than centre for Aaron Lennon. City enjoyed plenty of possession in midfield but, in the absence of Martin Petrov, struggled with their final ball. They almost broke the deadlock after Michael Johnson was picked out in the area by Benjani Mwaruwari on the right. Johnson's effort was blocked by Michael Dawson, who quickly recovered to stop Elano's goalbound shot from the edge of the area from finding the net. Tottenham were grateful to their centre-back for saving them, and it was another defender who helped give them the lead. Pascal Chimbonda, the man whose penalty miss ended Tottenham's European hopes in midweek, pounced on Vedran Corluka's tardy attempt to intercept Steed Malbranque's crossfield pass, and raced down the left before playing in Keane, who unleashed a fierce diagonal shot in off the far post with his left foot. The goal appeared to rouse City and Castillo should have done better than fire wide after showing Jonathan Woodgate a clean pair of heels. On 38 minutes Elano warmed Paul Robinson's palms with a rasping effort from the left side of the penalty area and, on the stroke of half-time, Castillo again panicked when through on goal, this time allowing Woodgate to make a covering tackle. Benjani was proving effective at stretching the Spurs defence on both flanks. Seven minutes after the restart he cut the ball back to Nery Castillo, who again fluffed his shot. The ball got caught under his feet and when he did get a shot off, Robinson saved with his feet. However, on 57 minutes City finally made the most of Benjani's lively front running. This time he sent a cross over from the left, Castillo again mishit his shot and Elano aimed a hopeful header goalwards. Ireland was on hand to guide the ball in from close range. It wasn't pretty, but it was deserved. Keane appeared to be Spurs's only bright spark in a disappointing second half for the visitors but the captain was withdrawn in favour of Darren Bent. Within a minute they were a goal down. Elano sent over an outswinging corner and Onuoha powered a free header past Robinson from eight yards out. Spurs came forward more in hope than with any great purpose, Dimitar Berbatov and Tom Huddlestone both trying their luck from range, while Bent was dubiously ruled offside when he poked a shot in after Jamie O'Hara's free-kick fell kindly to him. But City were worthy of their win, which takes them two points above Blackburn in eighth place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
