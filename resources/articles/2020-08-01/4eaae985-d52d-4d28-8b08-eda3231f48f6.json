The legal waiver appears to absolve the United States Tennis Association of liability \u201cfor any risks of loss or personal injury, including serious illness, injury or death \u2026 whether caused by the negligence of the NTC or otherwise\u201d. Although players frequently sign waivers, the tournament organisers had previously rejected the possibility of a Covid-19 specific waiver: \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to have players sign that because, look, they\u2019re at risk of developing Covid from many different scenarios. It\u2019s highly unlikely it\u2019s going to happen at the US Open,\u201d said Dr Brian Hainline, the chairman of the USTA Medical Advisory Group, during the launch press conference in June. Such a change of heart was likely driven by recent history. In 2015, the USTA was sued by Eugenie Bouchard after she slipped on cleaning fluid in a treatment room during the US Open. She received a large settlement in 2018. \u201cI think with any liability form, or anything that gets to that kind of realm, it\u2019s always going to be very dark and very sombre,\u201d Konta said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the content of the material I think. In terms of the practical side of it, whenever we go to a tournament, even before this situation we were already in charge of our own body. \u201cEvery decision we make when we play, how much we play, is going to have a direct effect on when our body holds up. So in terms of this virus and the decisions that players make regarding this, I think it falls under the same umbrella.\u201d Konta returns to competition against Marie Bouzkova at the Top Seed Open in Lexington, Kentucky. In order to avoid unnecessary air travel, the British No 1 flew from London to Chicago before driving nearly 400 miles to Lexington with her hitting partner, Dan Smethurst. After the tournament, they will drive more than 700 miles to New York for the US Open. \u201cI knew that [Covid-19] happened everywhere but it still shocked me a little bit when I arrived here and we were driving down and we had to stop to get some food,\u201d Konta said. \u201cIt was mask wearing inside and it was the [protective] screens, I was like, \u2018Wow, this is happening everywhere.\u2019 That was a really interesting reality to be hit with. In that respect it feels very much the same [as England] and I\u2019m taking the same precautions as I did at home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
