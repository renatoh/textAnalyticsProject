Mr Ingram had objected to a passage in the book, entitled I'm Not The Only One, which described the minister as, in his youth, playing the flute in a \"sectarian, anti-Catholic, Protestant-supremacist Orange Order band\". But at the Court of Session in Edinburgh yesterday, Lord Kilgarth rejected the motion for an interim interdict (Scottish legal parlance for an injunction) which would have halted publication of the book, which goes on sale today. However, although neither MP appeared in court in person, Mr Ingram admitted through his lawyers that he had been a member of the Junior Orange Lodge in Barlanark, at the age of 16. But he said he had only attended about three parades, stopped going for a year and did not renew his membership. Stephen Woolman, QC for Penguin books, argued that the statement of Mr Ingram's membership was true in its essentials, and that the adjectives constitute \"fair comment when applied to the institution in question\". A spokesman for Respect, the anti-war party Mr Galloway now heads, said the MP had agreed to remove the reference to \"playing the flute\" from future editions. Mr Ingram's lawyer had denied that Mr Ingram had ever played the flute, and said the comment was a \"zealous attack\" from a former colleague with an axe to grind. After the hearing, Mr Galloway - who is still awaiting another libel battle with the Daily Telegpraph over accusations he took secret monies from the Iraqi regime - said: \"It is almost beyond belief. I would have thought the country's armed forces minister would have had more on his horizon than whether someone said he was a simply a member of the Orange Order or a flute player in the Orange Order and whether he was defamed by that.\" \"I do hope the country's taxpayers were not paying his legal bills.\" Mr Galloway denies the accusation in the Telegraph, and has already won an out of court settlement from the Christian Science Monitor over similar accusations. No one from Mr Ingram's office was immediately available for comment. Mr Ingram himself is believed to be out of the country visiting British forces in Afghanistan. But Mr Ingram told yesterday's Scottish Daily Mirror: \" 'There is no truth in that story [that Mr Ingram played in a Orange Order band] nor indeed in any claim by George Galloway that he knew me when I was purportedly a member of such a band.' The book itself, it's name taken from the John Lennon song \"Imagine\", recounts Mr Galloway's passion for the Palestinian cause, sparked by a chance encounter with a campaigner in Dundee, his work on behalf of War on Want and trips to Iraq and meetings with Saddam Hussein. He also claims that the then Middle East minister, Peter Hain, agreed to let him be a secret channel between the government and the Iraqi leader before last year's war. Mr Hain confirmed that the conversation had taken place, but said it was Mr Galloway's suggestion, and that nothing had come of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
