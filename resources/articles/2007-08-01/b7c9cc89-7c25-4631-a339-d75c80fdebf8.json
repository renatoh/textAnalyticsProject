That was her third Group One win in a row, but the filly is still playing catch-up to the man on board for her last two wins. Johnny Murtagh is enjoying an amazing hot streak. His no-nonsense win on Peeping Fawn was the jockey's sixth Group One victory since the end of May. Murtagh had stacked up wins at the highest level on Notnowcato, Soldier's Tale and Simply Perfect before guiding Peeping Fawn to victory in last month's Irish Oaks as a prelude to securing King George VI and Queen Elizabeth honours on Dylan Thomas. Murtagh is halfway to matching the tally of 12 Group One wins worldwide he recorded in 2000. Next stop is the Arlington Million in Chicago on Saturday, when he rides Doctor Dino for French-based trainer Richard Gibson. \"Things are going well, all right,\" said Murtagh yesterday. \"I'm getting on some nice horses and Peeping Fawn, she's special. I hit the front sooner than I wanted on Saturday but she just took me there. When you get a filly as good as that, there's no telling how far they can go.\" Peeping Fawn readily accounted for the high-class older French filly, Mandesha, in the Nassau where jockeyship played its part. While Murtagh was making his winning run, Christophe Soumillon, having his first ride at Goodwood, had Mandesha covered up at the back of the field. Mandesha ran on late to finish a clear second but had no hope of catching the winner. \"Goodwood isn't the easiest track to ride,\" said Murtagh. \"I should probably have won the maiden on Belgrave Square on Saturday. I went for a run up the inside, got blocked and had to move out. We were beaten a neck.\" If that was one that got away, Murtagh's mastery of Goodwood's twists and turns was all too evident when he steered Yellowstone to victory in Tuesday's Gordon Stakes, getting first run on the hapless Richard Hills aboard Aqaleem. That was the first leg of a Group 3 double for Murtagh on the opening day. He will be a notable absentee from the three-man team representing Ireland in the Shergar Cup, the international jockeys' competition, at Ascot on Saturday. \"Richard Gibson is a nice fellow and I said I would ride Doctor Dino for him in the Arlington Million,\" said Murtagh. \"He's a top horse. He was third to Dylan Thomas in the Prix Ganay and I finished third on him in the Singapore Cup.\" Murtagh, meanwhile, may be reunited with Peeping Fawn in the Yorkshire Oaks on August 22. That race is also a possible target for Light Shift, third in the Nassau, but yesterday Alan Cooper, racing manager to the filly's owners the Niarchos Family, said: \"We'll take our time before confirming her next run. She is absolutely fine this morning but didn't enjoy the fast ground at Goodwood.\" Marchand D'Or, fourth in the July Cup when Dutch Art was second, took his revenge on Peter Chapple-Hyam's colt in the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville yesterday. Winning the race for the second year running, Freddie Head's sprinter charged down the outside of the field to collar Dutch Art, who held on for second. \"This is a very good horse and I would like to dedicate this win to my team as he is not an easy horse to handle,\" said Head. Coral pushed Dutch Art out to 7-1, from 9-2, for the Betfred Cup at Haydock. Sakhee's Secret, the July Cup winner, is 2-1 favourite. Ron Cox's tip of the day Cnoc Moy 7.30 Windsor Fresh from a double at Goodwood with Wake Up Maggie and Ace Of Hearts, trainer Chris Wall can keep up the good work with Cnoc Moy. George Baker, successful on Wake Up Maggie, has given Cnoc Moy copybook rides on the gelding's last two starts and has won with a bit in hand here and at Sandown. Just 3lb higher for his defeat of Lap Of Honour last time, Cnoc Moy can go in again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
