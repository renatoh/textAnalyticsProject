His \"blueprint for a sustainable London\" attempts to make London the world's most sustainable city and could see developments refused planning permission unless tough new environmental targets are met. Mr Livingstone wants renewable energy sources incorporated into all new buildings and developers to soften the hard edges of their structures with hanging gardens, roof gardens and bird boxes to keep buildings cool and draw wildlife into the city. The initiative comes amid growing frustration at national efforts to improve the sustainability of Britain's buildings which are estimated to account for half of greenhouse gas emissions. A survey of architects revealed that half believe conditions for sustainable building have got worse under Labour. Last week protesters from Greenpeace stormed John Prescott's house and installed solar panels to protest against the lack of progress made in using renewable energy. Under Mr Livingstone's proposals, at least 30% of construction materials should be sourced from within 35 miles to reduce transport pollution, and the mayor wants housing developments to recycle or compost over a third of their waste by the end of the decade. His plans have been labelled \"radical\" by sustainability experts and \"on another planet\" in comparison with government policies. Mr Livingstone's aims include every development being built on previously used land and that \"major developments should be zero carbon emission developments\". He also wants all major developments to incorporate hydrogen or fuel cell technology and include gas pipes capable of carrying hydrogen. All insulation materials should be from natural materials. His vision even extends to improving the view of the stars in the night sky by insisting that outdoor lighting is designed to reduce the sodium glow above the city. \"This guidance will help those involved in London's development to make the most of our precious natural resources, minimise nuisances such as noise and pollution and meet the needs of London's diverse population,\" Mr Livingstone said as he launched a consultation on his proposals which are set to become planning policy. The property industry, which is likely to foot the bill, called for \"pragmatism\". \"Livingstone can't stop the growth of commercial development,\" said Faraz Baber, spokesman for the British Property Federation. \"He needs to strike a balance so that new developments don't become so bureaucratic and expensive that they don't take place.\" Mr Livingstone's plans will increase pressure on the government, which has yet to respond to European legislation restricting the environmental impact of buildings. Publicly-funded homes will need to meet a sustainable buildings code from April next year, but it remains voluntary for the private sector. The plans do not include a system for rating energy performance of buildings, as demanded by Brussels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
