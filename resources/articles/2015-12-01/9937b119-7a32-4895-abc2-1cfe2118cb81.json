Sterling was the outstanding performer in Manchester City\u2019s 4-2 victory over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on Tuesday. The three points made Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side the winners of Group D, Sterling scoring a 79th-minute equaliser as City trailed 2-1 before putting them ahead two minutes later. While Wilfried Bony completed the scoring, Sterling also created David Silva\u2019s opener with an impressive back-heel pass to make for a memorable evening on his 21st birthday. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of my best nights in football. I said to myself if I could get on the scoresheet and we top the group I\u2019d definitely put it down as my best moment in football so far,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cI look at the biggest players in the world and try to see what they\u2019ve all got. I don\u2019t like to compare myself with people. I try to learn as much as I can from everyone around me. Definitely Messi and Ronaldo. They basically just set their lives to play football. \u201cI know that\u2019s obvious, they should, but they just take it so seriously. They\u2019ve got massive self-belief and know they\u2019re the best players in the world. That\u2019s what makes them unique and so special.\u201d Sterling left Liverpool for City last summer in a \u00a349m deal and acrimonious circumstances. He received criticism for his handling of the move but he claimed his mental strength means anything negative that may be said about him is brushed off. In this regard Sterling believes he is a different player from two or three years ago. \u201cMost definitely, especially with my self-belief now,\u201d he said. \u201cI just take everything I hear, take it in one ear and put it through the other. I concentrate on my football and that\u2019s all that matters. \u201cI sometimes criticise myself a bit too much because I know where I want to be. That\u2019s no different if I score or I don\u2019t score. I just need to keep working hard at what I know I can do and it\u2019ll all fall into place. When it does, it\u2019ll be a great moment.\u201d Asked why he can be overly self-critical, Sterling said: \u201cIt\u2019s because I know what I\u2019m capable of. To put it on the world stage is the most important thing now, showing people that I can play regularly and consistently, scoring goals and helping my team win matches.\u201d By topping the group City have the best chance of favourable last-16 opponents when the draw is made on Monday in Nyon. \u201cWith the football we\u2019re playing we definitely need to be more solid and keep more teams at bay,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely a force to be reckoned with. I don\u2019t doubt us against any team. I\u2019ll take any team with the players we\u2019ve got here fully fit and firing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
