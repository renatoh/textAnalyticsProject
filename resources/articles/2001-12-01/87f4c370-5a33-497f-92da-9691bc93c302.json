The struggle to move her crippled limbs is barely worth the desolate view afforded her - a grim concrete car park, beyond which the rain is further discolouring the filthy sandstone of a disused mill. Aged 24, Fawzia is house-bound. She cannot tackle the flat's three flights of narrow, twisting stairs since her pregnancy forced her to stop taking medication which eased the symptoms of her wasting illness. Isolated and depressed, this young Iraqi refugee has no television, radio or friends to pop by. She passes the time in prayer. She and her husband Ahmed know no one in this northern town and the few clothes they have are inadequate for the weather. Ahmed, who is desperate to start an English course, makes only essential trips out, to buy food with the \u00a326 in vouchers they get weekly. He worries for the security of his wife - the front door does not lock and is wedged shut using a folded piece of cardboard. 'We have escaped death for a prison,' says Fawzia through an interpreter. She smiles without humour and turns her face to the gas fire. She has had no antenatal care and has no idea of what to expect from the birth. Often the most vulnerable among the asylum seekers who find their way to Britain, the plight of refugee women is a major concern. Women who have lost the extended family network and the community that would have helped with childcare, have complex problems. In the UK they are often prevented from working, and a woman illiterate in her own language is less able to learn English. When she goes outside she faces racial or religious intolerance, if not blatant hostility, while women in relationships where there is domestic violence are silenced and trapped. Women are dispersed all over the country with even some cases of families being split up. It is down to charities such as Refugee Action to pick up the pieces. Refugee Action is trying to find Fawzia a GP and is talking to the National Asylum Seekers Service, the Government agency, about moving Fawzia to more suitable ground-floor accommodation. There are many examples of inappropriate housing: a Muslim mother above a noisy pub, a Hutu and a Tutsi sharing a room despite fleeing bloodshed between their tribes, a Czech mother in an area known as a National Front stronghold. Older women struggle as they are more entrenched in the traditions of home and less adaptable, while younger women can suffer at the hands of their own community, over fears that they will forget their original values in a new culture. All this is on top of the trauma of the persecution they have fled. In Fawzia and Ahmed's case they are still grieving for the families they may never see again. The couple fell in love as schoolchildren and for six years tried to persuade her parents to allow what was seen as an unsuitable marriage. Her wealthy family had links to Saddam Hussein's security forces, while he was a poor student, from a family out of favour with the regime. Fawzia's cousin wished to marry her and her refusal so incensed him that she received death threats while Ahmed bears the knife scars of a murder attempt. Fawzia pawned family heirlooms to raise the \u00a37,000 that bought them on an 11-day journey to Dover in the back of a refrigerated lorry. When the door opened they were dumped by the roadside. 'Police picked us up and put us in cells, I did not know where we were or if I would see Ahmed again,' says Fawzia. After exhaustive interviewing, the couple were sent to this two-room flat. It is adequate if sparse - a cooker, a fridge, two chairs, a bed. 'I do not think I will see my parents and my sisters again,' says Fawzia. 'It's too dangerous to write or phone. For their own safety, they cannot know where we are. 'What could we do? You cannot marry a man you do not like and you cannot see the man you love killed.' If Fawzia awaits the birth of her child with trepidation, Rosemary, an 18-year-old Burundian, is besotted with her five-week-old baby, who may be the result of a rape. Rosemary fled Burundi after returning home to find her house ablaze, her mother gone and her father being beaten to death by a marauding gang. The family's crime was that her father, a Hutu, had married a Tutsi woman. 'If I had not run they would have killed me,' she says in halting English, explaining how a business partner of her father's had risked his life to help her flee the country. She found another friend in Refugee Action, which fought to stop her being dispersed from her initial placement in Bristol days after her Caesarian birth. Sally Price, director of Refugee Action, said the practice of moving mothers within two weeks of giving birth is a damaging one. 'Refugee Action helps women like Fawzia and Rosemary to understand what will happen to them when they give birth. A caseworker may visit them after the birth and make sure the baby has clothes and blankets and they try to bring women together to support one another and make friends.' The value of Refugee Action is measured by the case of another new mother who was to be dispersed from Southampton to Glasgow. She had spent the maternity vouchers that must be used within a month of the birth on a cot and pram and took them with her to the bus. There she was told the bus company was under contract to the Home Office to carry only one bag per passenger: 'We're not a removal firm you know,' the driver told her. She was powerless to do anything but board the bus with her one carrier bag of second-hand clothes, leaving the cot and pram behind. Refugee Action picked them up and arranged transport of the equipment north. \u00b7 Names have been changed. \u00b7 On Tuesday, in Education Guardian, David Ward reports from a Liverpool school that thrives on giving refugee children a good education."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
