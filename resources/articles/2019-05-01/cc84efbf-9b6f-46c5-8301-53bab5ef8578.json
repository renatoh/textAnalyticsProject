A quick re-recap.... The US stock market has suffered its worst day since the start of 2019, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 617 points or 2.4%. European stock markets hit their lowest levels in over six weeks, after sharp losses in Asia overnight. The selloff came after China announced it will impose new tariffs on $60bn of US imports, from 1 June. Food, machinery, consumer goods and chemicals will all incur new levies up to 25%, making them less competitive and more expensive. Investors have been surprised by Beijing\u2019s response, with Chinese officials insisting they will never surrender to US demands. America has already hit back, announcing a hearing to discuss imposing tariffs on almost all Chinese goods. Donald Trump has announced fresh help for US farmers hurt by the trade war, due to the slump in demand for American agriculture. Here\u2019s the earlier summary. Here\u2019s our latest news stories on today\u2019s events: We\u2019ll be back on Tuesday for more coverage of the trade wars, and more. Goodnight. GW A late newsflash: the US trade representative\u2019s offices will hold public hearings on June 17 about whether to impose a new round of tariffs on China. These talks will focus on around $300bn of Chinese imports that haven\u2019t been dragged into the trade war so far. That would include mobile phones and laptop computers. But some products would still be exempt, the USTR suggests, such as pharmaceuticals, other medical goods, and some rare minerals (thanks to Reuters for the info). Today\u2019s market mayhem is prominently covered in tomorrow\u2019s UK newspapers. Here\u2019s a few early front pages.... China\u2019s decision to impose higher tariffs on thousands of US goods -- from spinach and coffee to batteries and antiques -- has clearly given investors a lot to think about. It\u2019s clearly a punchy response, just hours after president Trump tweeted that Beijing should do no such thing. Some investors had clearly expected a more moderate reaction. With $60bn of US goods affected, there are concerns that US exporters will suffer. The move is also fuelling concerns that the trade war could become even more intense. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York, sums up the mood: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is a lot of nervousness around the U.S.-China trade negotiations and concern that it\u2019s really deteriorating pretty significantly and that\u2019s impacting all areas of markets. Newsflash: The US stock market has closed with a shudder, as the escalating trade war with China scares Wall Street . The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 have both posted their biggest losses since January 3rd, while the tech-focused Nasdaq had its worst since last 2018. Here\u2019s the damage: The Dow: Down 617 points or 2.4% at 25,324 points. S&amp;P 500: Down 69 points or 2.4% at 2,811 Nasdaq: Down 269 points or 3.4% at 7,647 The selloff is broad-based, with industrial, technology, financial and raw material firms all leading the rout. Apple (-6%), Boeing (-4.8%) and Caterpillar (-4.5%) the worst-performing stocks on the Dow. As flagged up earlier, this is the worst start to any May in 50 years -- underlying how much alarm there is about the trade war. William Reinsch of Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies suspects that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will eventually try to resolve the trade war themselves. But who would win such a battle? Reinsch\u2019s money is on the Chinese leader. He writes: One clear consequence is that the two presidents have effectively declared themselves the chief negotiators. Trump has been overruling his various representatives for some time, and it looks like Xi Jinping did the same to Liu He. The result is that both negotiators know they do not have full authority, and anything they agree to risks being countermanded. That means reaching an agreement can only be done at the top. If you\u2019re going to act as the negotiator, then eventually you actually have to negotiate. This is also one of those cases where each president thinks he can get the better of the other. Xi probably thinks, correctly, that he will know the details better than Trump and can outwit him. Trump thinks, less correctly, that he is a better negotiator and can intimidate Xi. Not a recipe for a successful outcome, but the two presidents have, by their own actions, made a meeting inevitable. Donald Trump is certainly keeping us on our toes. He\u2019s now told reporters at the White House that US farmers will get $15bn in new aid. The president declared: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take the highest year, the biggest purchase that China has ever made with our farmers, which is about $15 billion, and do something reciprocal to our farmers so our farmers can do well.\u201d America\u2019s agricultural workers certainly need a helping hand, after seeing soybean prices hit a 10-year low today. Today\u2019s news that China will impose new tariffs on exports such as beef, lamb, frozen spinach and various canned vegetables will be a bitter blow to some struggling farmers. From Washington, my colleague David Smith has written about how Donald Trump is at odds with some in his own party over trade: Not for the first time, Trump is scrambling political allegiances. It is especially awkward for Republicans. The president\u2019s protectionist \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda flies in the face of the party\u2019s free market principles and threatens to hurt voters in red states. Farmers are one example. At a news conference organised by the campaign group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, in response to the raising of tariffs to 25%, Brent Bible, a soybean and corn farmer in Lafayette, Indiana, said: \u201cOur competitive advantage has always been we are a reliable source of product. This has taken that away. \u201cIt has made it \u2026 so uncompetitive that other countries are willing to now take the risk that some of the South American countries have in terms of logistics, safety and being reliable. China and others are now willing to take that risk since we are priced so far out of the market.\u201d The White House has already paid out $12bn in aid for farmers hurt by Chinese tariffs against soybeans and other agricultural products, effectively wiping out financial rewards Trump claims tariffs have reaped. More here: Hmmm. Newswires are now reporting that president Trump has said he\u2019s not decided whether to impose new tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports. This is helping stocks pull back in New York... Here\u2019s our news story on the latest trade war developments, and the stock market losses. Investors weren\u2019t expecting such a firm response from Beijing, says Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist for JP Morgan. She told Bloomberg: China retaliating as fast as they did was a clear signal they\u2019re not going to be pushed around. Markets would like a little bit more play nice and maybe even a bit of complacency from China. It was interesting it wasn\u2019t done on the weekend. It was done just in time, Monday morning for markets to open. That helps explain the scale of today\u2019s selloff - the biggest since January. It\u2019s certainly been a volatile May: Today\u2019s rout means the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 5% this month, its worst start to any May since 1970, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq has lost 5.7%, which is its worst early May since 2000 (after the dot-com bubble burst). The sell off is intensifying in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average now down 701 point at 25,240, a slide of 2.7%. That\u2019s one of the worst drop in several months. Apple is being hit on two fronts today. As well as the trade war angst, the tech company has lost a legal challenge from a group of iPhone owners who claim its App Store monopoly breaks antitrust rules The Supreme Court has narrowly ruled by 5-4 that the case can proceed. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the bench by Donald Trump last year, was among the five justices who backed the move. He concluded that citizens have the right to sue, when \u201cretailers engage in unlawful anticompetitive conduct that harms consumers.\u201d Marketwatch have created this neat chart showing how much US-China trade is at stake. Comparing the clash to a fantasy battle, they write that the trade war will overshadow all over economic news: When the world\u2019s two largest economies \u2014 Godzilla and Ghidorah \u2014 engage in a major clash there\u2019s bound to be little attention paid to anything else. Retail sales, home construction and industrial production are on the docket this week, but it won\u2019t matter much to Wall Street if the U.S. and China can\u2019t resolve a tense dispute over trade rules that\u2019s festered since last summer. There\u2019s not been any official response from the US to China\u2019s decision to hike tariffs on up to $60bn of goods. But Donald Trump will not be happy -- having warned China this very morning not to retaliate. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics suspects the US president could take fresh tit-for-tat action, by pressing on with tariffs on ALL Chinese goods. Hunter writes: The move will risk provoking the ire of Mr Trump, who had warned China earlier on Monday not to retaliate to the latest US measures. That could make the prospect of US tariffs being imposed on the remaining $300bn of Chinese imports \u2013 provisional details of which were due to be published by the US Trade Representative later on Monday \u2013 even more likely. Ouch! Trade war fears have driven Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down to its lowest close in two months. European stock markets suffered a sharper selloff, with consumer goods manufacturers, technology firms and mining companies all dropping. Here\u2019s the damage: FTSE 100: down 39 points at 7163, a fall of 0.5% German DAX: down 163 points at 11,896, a fall of 1.35% French CAC: down 59 points at 5,267, a fall of 1.1% Wall Street traders are looking pensive, and even a little shell-shocked today, as markets suffer a hefty rout: I think a recap might be helpful. China has escalated the trade war with America, by announcing plans to hike the tariffs on up to $60bn of US goods, sending stocks to their lowest level in two months. From June 1, Beijing will charge a new 25% tariff on almost 2,500 items, from food and consumer goods to chemicals and machinery. It includes food products, alcoholic drinks, chemicals, manufacturing products, and consumer goods such as televisions, headphones, DVD players, cameras, telescopes, alarm clocks, instruments such as pianos, buttons, and fishing rods will now be much pricier. Other products will soon incur a 20% or 10% additional levy. Here\u2019s more details of the list. This is China\u2019s official retaliation to America\u2019s decision to hike its tariff on $200bn of Chinese-made products to 25% last Friday. Beijing criticised the White House for its... escalation of Sino-US economic and trade frictions, contrary to the consensus between China and the United States on resolving trade differences through consultations, jeopardising the interests of both sides and not meeting the general expectations of the international community. The move came shortly after Donald Trump warned China not to retaliate, saying it would be hurt badly if it dared to. China, though, is sticking to its commitments to retaliate to US trade war moves. Earlier today it insisted that it would never \u201csurrender\u201d, following inconclusive talks last week. President Trump also claimed that Chinese firms, not US consumers, were bearing the cost of his latest tariffs. Goldman Sachs, though, has shown that US citizens are actually being hit in the pocket, as American companies are passing tariffs (effectively taxes) onto them. Financial markets have been roiled by the escalation of the trade war. The US stock market is suffering one of its worst days of 2019, down over 2% after a turbulent morning. The Dow Jones industrial average has sunk by over 600 points, in a nervy session. Technology stocks and major exporters are leading the selloff, on fears that a full-blown trade war could cause serious economic damage. Soybean prices have hit a decade-low, as investors anticipate that China could clash its purchases of US agricultural products. China\u2019s yuan has also weakened to its lowest level in months. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has now sunk by 610 points, or 2.35%, to 25,331 points. That\u2019s a fresh two-month low. The trade war between the US and China has been rumbling on for roughly a year now. The latest escalation, with fresh tariffs imposed at both borders, could hurt global growth badly, says Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital. \u201cUncertainty over the outcome of the US-China trade talks has rattled investor sentiment and an escalation in tariffs threatens to worsen the outlook for the global economy.\u201d The UK stock market is sliding towards its lowest level in two months, as US-China trade war fears give global investors the shivers. The FTSE 100 index has lost 38 points to 7,167 points in late London trading; it hasn\u2019t closed lower since mid-March. The sell-off on Wall Street is getting worse. The Dow Jones industrial average has now shed 585 points, or 2.2%, to 25,356 points -- its lowest level in two months. The top fallers on the Dow are Apple (-5.6%), machinery maker Caterpillar (-4.5%), Cisco (-3.6%) and Boeing (-3.2%) -- all likely casualties of a deeper trade war. The Nasdaq has lost 3%, dragged down by a range of technology stocks. The list of nearly 2,500 US products that will now incur a 25% tariff when sold to China is long, and varied (and online here, in Mandarin). It includes food products, such as meat, honey, bamboo, frozen peas and spinach, roasted coffee, green teas, various oils, fruit juice and stuffed pasta. Alcoholic drinks such as beer, wine and gin are also on the list. Many chemicals are listed, as is manufacturing equipment such as vacuum moulding, wire-drawing and cable-making machines. On the consumer side, televisions, headphones, DVD players, cameras, telescopes, alarm clocks, instruments such as pianos, buttons, and fishing rods will now be much pricier. There\u2019s also a new 20% tariff list covering over 1,000 products. This 20% tariff will hit also hit food (frozen strawberries, shelled peanuts), chemicals, books, some steel products, copper pipes, batteries and power supplies, photography equipment, brushes..... and consumer products such as golf clubs, bowling pins, roller skates, pens, pencils and antiques. China hasn\u2019t said anything officially about stopping buying US government debt. But the very hint (via the Global Times newspaper) that the idea is being talked about in some quarters is worrying investors. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says China has hit back hard at America: US equity markets are taking a battering as China has responded in kind to US tariffs. Beijing will slap tariffs on up to $60bn in goods, and reports suggest China may also stop purchasing US agricultural products. There is even talk \u2013 the ultimate worry \u2013 of China dumping US Treasuries. This was also the ace up the sleeve for China. Whilst China is running out of US goods to tax, it does have other tools it can use to put pressure on the White House. Make no mistake this is a serious escalation and we have a trade war on our hands again. The breakdown last week has not proved temporary and it seems China is prepared to go toe-to-toe with the US on this. Ultimately though we should assume that after this spat \u2013 which is about face as much as anything \u2013 we should see the parties come around to talks again. Quite whether they can ever achieve a meaningful deal is another matter \u2013 talks could extend into 2020 with no result. I just have this sense this going to rumble on fruitlessly for a long time. Shares in Boeing have lost 3% of their value. The suggestion that Beijing is considering buying fewer planes from the US manufacturer is unnerving investors in New York. It\u2019s early days, but Wall Street is on track for its lowest close since late March. Major technology companies are being hit hard by the latest tit-for-tat retaliations between Washington and Beijing. Apple is looking particularly bruised, sliding by 5%. It would be hurt if America imposes tariffs on all goods made in China, as many products such as iPhones are assembled there. Facebook and Amazon are also being swept up in the selloff: Newsflash: The US stock markets has opened sharply in the red, as a wave of selling sweeps through Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average have plunged by 480 points as the opening bell rings, a slump of 1.85% to 25,461. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has lost 1.7% while the technology-focused Nasdaq has lost 2.4% in a nervy start to trading. The official statement from China\u2019s Ministry of Finance is online here, in Mandarin. It appears that China is hiking the tariffs on over 4,000 products. They\u2019re part of $60bn worth of US goods which were first targeted last year (when Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports). Some products will be hit with a new tariff of 25%, other will rise to 20% or 10%, while several hundred will be spared, and still only face a 5% tariff. Here\u2019s the details: 25% tariffs on 2,493 items 20% tariffs on 1,078 items 10% tariffs on 974 items 5% tariffs to continue on 595 items The statement explains that Beijing is responding to last Friday\u2019s moves by the US, saying: On May 9, 2019, the US government announced that since May 10, 2019, the tariff rate imposed on the $200 billion list of goods imported from China has increased from 10% to 25%. The above measures by the United States have led to an escalation of Sino-US economic and trade frictions, contrary to the consensus between China and the United States on resolving trade differences through consultations, jeopardising the interests of both sides and not meeting the general expectations of the international community. European stock markets have sunk to new seven-week lows, as traders fear that the US-China trade war is escalating alarmingly. Every bourses is in the red, dragging the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index down by over 1%. Rupert Thompson, head of research at asset managers Kingswood, says there\u2019s a risk that the negotiations break down completely: There is a danger of miscalculation with Trump overplaying his hand and the Chinese being unwilling to lose face and accommodate his demands. Somewhat surprisingly, the direct impact on economic growth of these tariff increases - even if they all went ahead \u2013 should not be that large. Rather, the main risk lies in the indirect effects on growth stemming from the hit to business confidence and likely sell-off in equity markets. These would very likely exceed the total direct impact. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to China\u2019s retaliation: Ouch! Wall Street is now heading for sharper falls, as the sight of China hitting back against the US gives investors a fright. The Dow Jones industrial average is bring called down 464 points, or 1.8%, to 25,500. The Nasdaq index is rattling towards a 2.5% plunge -- it\u2019s full of technology companies who would suffer badly if trade relations between the US and China get any frostier. European markets have been dragged deeper into the red too, with Germany\u2019s DAX falling 1.3% today. China\u2019s Global Times\u2019s editor in chief, Hu Xijin, is reporting that Beijing is also considering stopping buying US agricultural products -- which would be a serious blow to American farmers. China is also considering slashing orders for new Boeing planes, he adds. If so, that would further ratchet up the trade war. NEWSFLASH: China has just escalated the trade war with the US, by announcing plans to hike tariffs on American goods bought by Chinese companies. Beijing says that it will set new tariffs of between 5% and 25% on $60bn of US imports. The move will hit around 5,000 products, it says. The tariffs are due to kick in on June 1st, or under three week\u2019s time. This is China\u2019s eagerly-awaited response to the new US tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, which was implemented on Friday morning. It shows that Beijing is determined not to back down, and prepared to ignore Donald Trump\u2019s warning\u2019s that they will suffer if they hit back. More to follow.... Wall Street is still heading towards a weak open, with less than 90 minutes to go. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has produced new research showing clearly that US consumers are paying the price of the trade war. In a new research note, Goldman showed that prices in the shops have risen since the trade war began, and that Chinese firms have not - as Trump argues - cut their prices to compensate. Goldman says the tariffs imposed on $250bn of Chinese goods last year fell \u201centirely\u201d on American businesses and households, which is certainly not the White House narrative. Its analysts say: \u201cOne might have expected that Chinese exporters of tariff-affected goods would have to lower their prices somewhat to compete in the US market, sharing in the cost of the tariffs. \u201cHowever, analysis at the extremely detailed item level in the two new studies shows no decline in the prices (exclusive of tariffs) of imported goods from China that faced tariffs.\u201d Another eyebrow-raising tweet from the White House.... Putting our fact-checking boots on again, the president\u2019s absolutely right about the Q1 growth rate (it\u2019s the equivalent of a 0.8% quarter-on-quarter growth). But..that was mainly due to a rise in consumer spending, a build-up of company inventories (perhaps firms stock-piling ahead of a trade war), and a drop in imports (again, perhaps trade-war related). And if tariffs are mainly paid by US companies, they\u2019re effectively a tax -- so not actually good for growth at all. Is Donald Trump correct that China picks up most of the new tariffs on their goods entering the US, as he just tweeted? It appear not. The president has claimed before that China pays 21% of the 25% additional tariff [presumably by cutting their prices to absorb the hit]. If this were true, then tariffs wuld indeed be bringing money into the US. However, most economists argue that it\u2019s incorrect, and that US companies bear the burden when they import goods. Bloomberg examined the 21% claim last week, and declared it fault, saying: Those numbers appear to be estimates from a 2018 report based on historical data, said David Weinstein, an economics professor at Columbia University and one of the authors of the March study. Actual data on tariffs and trade from 2017 and 2018 showed that foreign firms didn\u2019t lower their prices at all, so the full impact was born by U.S. firms and consumers, he said. A separate paper published in March by economists Pinelopi Goldberg, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, Pablo Fajgelbaum of UCLA, Patrick Kennedy of the University of California, Berkeley, and Amit Khandelwal of Columbia Business School also found that consumers and U.S. companies were paying most of the costs of Trump\u2019s tariffs. It also went a step further: After factoring in the retaliation by other countries, it concluded the main victims of Trump\u2019s trade wars had been farmers and blue-collar workers in areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election. Trump really is taking aim at China... Remarkably, he\u2019s now tweeted that the country will be \u2018hurt very badly\u2019 unless they agree a trade deal. (\u2018backed out\u2019 is a reference to US claims that China tried to renegotiate some of the pledges made in recent negotiations). Newsflash: Donald Trump has warned China not to retaliate against the latest tariffs, warning that the situation \u2018will only get worse\u2019 if they do. In an early morning Tweet thread, the president also denies that US consumers will pay the tariffs -- claiming that China picks up almost all of the bill (even though American firms actually pay it). He\u2019s also urging US companies to source their products from countries other than China, or (ideally) move production to America .... China\u2019s CSI 300 index has ended the day down 1.6% at 3,668, a drop of 61 points. Traders were in cautious mood as they waited for Beijing\u2019s formal response to the new US tariffs on Chinese imports -- and the prospect of more to come. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: President Trump on Friday raised tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% and is now examining slapping tariffs on all remaining goods imported from China \u2013 worth about $300bn. The rhetoric and posturing is not good for risk and events over the last few days diminish the likelihood we will see a meaningful deal done. When we look at the posturing with Iran, it looks like the geopolitical hawks in the White House are in control. And unlike the weak Theresa May, Donald Trump is prepared to do no deal rather than a bad deal. Chinese state television is also hammering home the \u2018never surrender\u2019 message. Reuters reports: State television said...that the effect on the Chinese economy from the U.S. tariffs was \u201ctotally controllable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. China is bound to turn crisis to opportunity and use this to test its abilities, to make the country even stronger.\u201d China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily Newspaper has also declared that Beijing won\u2019t back down in the trade dispute. An editorial in the state-controlled newspaper says: \u201cChina has been pushing forward the bilateral talks with a high sense of responsibility and maximized sincerity, but it will never yield to the extreme pressure from the U.S., or compromise on matters of principle.\u201d The piece also blames the US government for the deterioration in the trade talks, by hiking tariffs on Chinese goods last week. Crude oil is rallying this morning, as tensions in the Middle East rise alarmingly. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil has jumped by 1.6% to $71.76, after Saudi Arabia reported that two of its oil tankers were attacked off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, in the Gulf of Omab. Saudi authorities blamed \u201ca sabotage attack\u201d, which caused significant damage to the vessels. Fortunately, there are apparently no casualties or oil spills, but the attack has obviously caused worries that global crude supplies could be disrupted. There\u2019s no indication who was responsible. Iran (which borders the north of the Gulf) has called for an investigation, calling the move \u201cworrisome and dreadful\u201d. Dawn is about to break in New York, but investors there aren\u2019t in a sunny mood.... Eleanor Creagh of Saxo Bank fears that the Chinese yuan could keep falling, as the trade war intensifies. The yuan is typically tightly managed by Beijing, so weakening the currency would make Chinese exports more competitive -- cushioning the blow from new higher tariffs at the US border. The Chinese yuan is being buffered by trade war worries. The yuan is on track for its biggest daily fall in nine months today, currently down almost 0.8% at \u00a56.8735. That\u2019s its weakest levels since the start of January, suggesting investors fear ongoing economic volatility. Currency expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Asian markets have reacted to the lack of progress in US/Chinese trade talks by selling the yuan and won, driving equity indices lower, and sending bond prices and the yen higher. Leading Chinese journalist Hu Xijin believes China is absolutely serious about not backing down to US pressures. He\u2019s tweeted that Beijing is committed to its three key demands, and won\u2019t compromise otherwise: Reminder, those three demands are: The U.S. must remove all the additional tariffs imposed on China The targets set by the U.S. for Chinese purchases should be in line with real demand The text of a deal should be \u201cbalanced\u201d to ensure the \u201cdignity\u201d of both nations Newsflash: China\u2019s government has hit back at Washington, vowing not to cave into attacks from the US government, Speaking to reporters in Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang struck a defiant tone. He said China would \u201cnever surrender\u201d to foreign pressures, despite America now drawing up plans for tariffs on all Chinese imports (an extra $300bn). Geng declared: \u201cChina will never surrender to external pressure. We have the confidence and the ability to protect our lawful and legitimate rights,\u201d However, Geng didn\u2019t reveal what retaliatory measures China will take to the new 25% tariffs on thousands of its goods with $200bn per year (imposed on Friday). Instead, he left the threat of imminent retaliation dangling in the air.... \u201cAs for the details, please continue to pay attention.\u201d European stock markets have fallen to their lowest level since late March, following losses in Asia. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC indices have both lost 0.5%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has fallen by 0.7%. Major exporters, such as steelmaker Thyssenkrupp and carmakers Peugeot and Volkswagen are among the top fallers. Connor Campbelll of SpreadEx blames trade tensions, and the prospect of the US and China imposing more tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. Nervously waiting for China to blast back following last week\u2019s aggressive trade war volley from the US, the European indices limped through the ope With last week\u2019s trade talks failing to yield an agreement between Beijing and Washington \u2013 funny how that happens when you severely hike tariff rates between days 1 and 2 \u2013 and Trump continuing to tweet up a storm, investors are now braced for China\u2019s retaliation, an attack that is yet to materialise. Chinese car sales have fallen for the 10th month running, in a sign that its economy is weakening. Auto sales slumped by 14.6% in April, compared with a year earlier, government figures show. That follows a 5.2% decline in March, showing that consumers are cutting back. Sales shrank in 2018 for the first time since the 1990s, and this year doesn\u2019t appear to be any better -- despite Beijing\u2019s attempts to stimulate its economy. One piece of good news -- sales of new energy vehicles jumped 18% year-on-year to 97,000 vehicles. Soybean prices have slumped to their lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, driven down by the prospect of a deeper China-US trade war. A key soybean futures contract has fallen by 0.8% to just $8.03 per bushel in early trading, reports Reuters. China has been a vital export market for US soybean farmers, but sales have slumped in recent months after Beijing hit them with tariffs last year. Agricultural exports could easily be targeted again as part of a reprisal for America\u2019s new tariffs. Wheat and corn futures have also fallen, by around 1%. The stock market boards in China are a sea of green today - and that\u2019s bad news for investors, as it means shares are falling. Red (or lucky) stock moves were in short supply, as the benchmark CSI 300 index slid by 1.8% in nervous trading today. Stocks had rallied on Friday, despite America hiking the levy on $200bn of Chinese goods to 25%. But the news that the remaining $300bn of goods could soon face hefty tariffs too has alarmed investors. Jingyi Pan of IG says: \u201cThe lack of resolution in the latest U.S.-China trade talks coupled with continued provocative tweets from President Trump provides no relief for risk sentiment as we look to another weak start to the week for Asia markets.\u201d That weak start has knocked 0.7% off Japan\u2019s Nikkei today, and wiped 1.3% off South Korea\u2019s Kospi index. Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, revealed yesterday that the White House expects China to hit back soon. He told Fox News: \u201cThe expected countermeasures have not yet materialized. We may know more today or even this evening or tomorrow.\u201d He suggested it could take several months to impose new tariffs on all remaining Chinese exports,saying: Call it three months. I don\u2019t know. That will take some time and then of course the president\u2019s going to have to make the final decision on that.\u201d Kudlow also suggested that Trump could discuss the trade issue with China\u2019s president Xi at next month\u2019s G20 leaders\u2019 meeting. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade tensions are weighing heavily on the financial markets this morning after relations between China and the US soured last week. Having slapped new 25% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods on Friday, the US is now drawing up plans for similar tariffs on another $300bn of goods -- or virtually all China\u2019s sales to America. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declared: \u201cEarlier today, at the direction of the President, the United States increased the level of tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The President also ordered us to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China, which are valued at approximately $300 billion.\u201d Investors are now braced nervously for Beijing to retaliate against America\u2019s new tariffs, after vice-premier Liu He returned from talks in Washington without a breakthrough. Liu insists that America must lift its tariffs before a deal can be reached - something that hawkish members of the White House won\u2019t accept. China has two other demands, Liu told reporters; The targets set by the U.S. for Chinese purchases should be in line with real demand, and the text of a deal should be \u201cbalanced\u201d to ensure the \u201cdignity\u201d of both nations. Protecting other people\u2019s dignity isn\u2019t exactly Donald Trump\u2019s core skill, of course. Over the weekend, he fired of a brisk volley of tweets on the issue, blaming China for backtracking on recent commitments. He also repeated a promise to support US farmers - an admission that the trade war is hurting. As China imports less than $200bn of US goods per year, it can\u2019t simply copy America\u2019s tariffs. But it\u2019s expected to take some retaliatory measures, says Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada: Today, US Trade Representative will begin the process of \u201cimposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China\u201d per Robert Lighthizer\u2019s statement on Friday. Markets are also waiting for China\u2019s retaliation, as it has close to run out of US imports on which to impose tariffs. China said the US had \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d trade talks in a People\u2019s Daily Commentary, though as we go to press, no retaliatory measures have been announced yet. Asia-Pacific markets have already been hit by the trade jitters, with fresh losses in Japan, China and South Korea today. OCBC analyst Tommy Xie Dongming told clients that the breakdown in talks last week has surprised investors. \u201cThe sudden, unexpected collapse ahead of the final step to ink a 150-page long trade deal caught market by surprise\u201d \u201cMarkets will tread cautiously, with the market focus still be on any developing headlines about China\u2019s possible retaliatory moves and next steps for trade talks from here until Trump and Xi meet at the G20 meeting in late June. The futures market suggests the S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq will all fall by 1% when trading begins. European stocks, though, are holding up better - with some analysts suggesting Europe looks a more attractive investment in the current climate (although a really severe trade war will hurt everyone). With little else on the agenda today, trade worries will probably overshadow the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
