There had been hopes that Paul Dickov, Keith Gillespie and Frank Sinclair would be released on bail today, but the judge involved in the case is awaiting the results of forensic evidence being reviewed in Madrid. He also has 300 pages of evidence and statements to sift through, meaning the players will have spent seven nights in Sangonera prison by the time the charge reaches court. There is also the prospect of the trio facing their accusers in a direct confrontation at the Palace of Justice in Cartagena as Spanish law permits such a meeting. \"It is possible,\" said Luis Ruiperez, the man representing the players, who also confirmed there wouldn't be a decision on the players' bail application until Thursday at the earliest. Having visited the players at the jail in Murcia this morning, Ruiperez maintained they were \"in good health,\" and added: \"They are in prison, they want to be free.\" According to some reports, the men have spent time playing football with other inmates. Meanwhile, Leicester chief executive Tim Davies returned to Spain last night determined to ensure \"justice can be done\" and \"the right facts come out\". \"I get a sense that the lawyers are more optimistic at present,\" he said. \"I think resolution can be a number of outcomes. Either everybody returns back to England totally free of any charges, they might return back to England to face trial at another date, or it may be that the players stay in jail a little bit longer.\" Davies also confirmed that the players were being supported by their partners, with Dickov's wife seeing her husband today for the first time since his arrest. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Oliver needs me. Just as a single drop of ink colours 100 litres of water, I want to snuff out the hatred in the stadium with my love\" - Ahead of Bayern's Big Cup bombardment in Madrid, Oliver Kahn's young girlfriend Verena Kerth fills the pages of Bild with love and claptrap. * * * * * * * * * * * * UNLUCKY MAN Unless you're Mrs Fergie or a Manchester-United-supporting MI6-agent with time, our taxes, and - if David Shayler's any guide - a few pounds to burn, you probably won't have an intimate knowledge of Sir Alex Ferguson's recent movements. However judging by the day United have had, the Fiver predicts the following: on waking Fergie grimly stared at a mirror, which shattered. He then skidded haphazardly along a polished floor, accidentally opening an umbrella as he did so before - warrhhh! - tripping out of the front door, landing head-first under an open ladder and picking up exactly 13 bruises as a black cat skipped across his path. Yep, it hasn't been Old Claret Face's lucky day. For starters, Uefa is to appeal against itself over Roy Keane's one-match suspension. Yes, you read that right. Apparently [Fiver dons anorak] under article 50 of their disciplinary regulations, Uefa have the power of appeal against verdicts taken by their disciplinary panel and zzzz are asking for Keane's challenge to be considered as assault, which zzzzzz would mean a ban of at least three matches - not the greatest news for United ahead of tonight's big Big Cup match against Porto. But that's not all Ferg's had to put up with, because TWO managers have been trying to outdo him - HIM! - in the mind-games stakes. First Porto coach Jose Morinho weighed in with the faux-coy: \"It's difficult for me to understand why United are so worried, they are the better team; they have everything. Why are they afraid?\" And then Arsenal's Arsene Wenger was seen lobbying the FA to take the Big Two's FA Cup semi-final away from Villa Park and to the Millennium Stadium - much to United's displeasure. Still, it's not all bad news - United's chief exec David Gill says that United won't have to revise their budgets if they lose tonight. \"We haven't forecast to get to the quarter-finals so it won't impact on what we have in our internal projections for this year,\" he admitted. Judging by United's recent form, that's probably wise. * * * * * * * * * * * * STILL WANT MORE?

To fill Paul Sturrock's still-pungent Plymouth boots, the club will poach Neale Cooper from Hartlepool.

Glasgow Polis have confirmed they'll be taking no action against Rangers defender Maurice Ross following an incident during Sunday's Old Firm derby. He allegedly hoofed a ball into the crowd at a Celtic fan and hit her on the arm. And Sheffield Wednesday may be \u00a3512bn in debt and reduced to begging with a tin and mangy whippet at Meadowhall, but they're not so desperate that they need Ken Bates' Russian millions. \"When he jumps in the water, the sharks jump out,\" scoffed chairman Dave Allen at the club's annual meeting. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: Big Cup live - Man U v Porto (7.30pm) Today's Nightmare Hell was penned by an idiot, although he'd prefer we call him Young Archie.
