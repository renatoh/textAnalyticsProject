Claire Gilham, who has talked about receiving death threats, dealing with violent courtroom litigants and hostage-taking, is hoping to establish the right for judges to enjoy the standard protections given to workers. Judges, like clerics, are deemed to be \u201coffice-holders\u201d and are not therefore entitled to the safeguards granted to whistleblowers under the Employment Rights Act to make disclosures in the public interest. Since the 1701 Act of Settlement, judges have been deemed to hold their office \u201cduring good behaviour\u201d. In order to guarantee judicial independence, they can only be removed because of misbehaviour or inability to perform their duties. Gilham was the deputy director of the Independent Police Complaints Commission before she became a judge in 2006. The Ministry of Justice argues she is an office holder and therefore does not have an employment contract with the ministry. Before the hearing in Westminster on Wednesday, Gilham said: \u201cI am pleased that after six long years, this important case on whistleblowing rights is finally being heard today. Judicial independence is important and the right to report shortcomings and blow the whistle is a safeguard to protect it. \u201cWhistleblowers everywhere will welcome clarity on how their status as a judge, office-holder or any person working other than under a contract limits their rights and protection from unfair treatment.\u201d She has had to mortgage her home to pay her legal bills and has launched a crowdfunding appeal on the CrowdJustice website to seek support and raise awareness. The whistleblowing charity Protect, formerly Public Concern at Work, is intervening in the hearing. As a district judge at Warrington county court, Gilham raised concerns about cuts to the legal system, excessive workloads and a lack of suitable courtroom accommodation. Under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, legal aid for claimants in most divorce and custody hearings was removed in 2013, leaving them unrepresented. Without lawyers in court, clashes between parties were more frequent. Karon Monaghan QC, representing Gilham, told the supreme court that the \u201cfrequency and severity of security incidents rose as legal aid was withdrawn\u201d. Threats of violence increased. On one occasion Gilham, who dealt with domestic and family cases, was warned by police that someone was threatening to kill her. She has described occasional hostage-taking incidents inside courts when family cases erupted into angry disputes. She made a complaint through a formal grievance procedure which was eventually dealt with by Lord Justice Tomlinson. He concluded that the types of issues she was raising could not be dealt with that way, the supreme court was told. \u201cThere was no internal mechanism for whistleblowing,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cThe ability for a judge to whistleblow would help maintain the independence of the judiciary.\u201d Bob Matheson of Protect said: \u201cHere the issue is who should have protection \u2013 and our view is that the law is too narrowly drawn if judges are excluded from protection when they identify concerns. We want the government to conduct a wider review of UK whistleblowing legislation but until then the courts can shape the law.\u201d Emilie Cole, a partner in the law firm Irwin Mitchell, said: \u201cEveryone should have the right to blow the whistle, safe in the knowledge that they will be protected from harm for doing so. \u201cThe background of this legal protection comes from a long line of high-profile disasters which caused avoidable, horrific deaths for many innocent people. Anything that stands in the way of an individual expressing concerns about health and safety and breaches of the law can\u2019t be in the public interest or benefit wider society.\u201d The MoJ has denied that Gilham suffered through her whistleblowing. When the case first came to court, the ministry said: \u201cThere are robust security and safety measures in place to protect judges and everyone else who attends court. \u201cJudges are not in a contractual relationship with the MoJ but hold office on appointment by Her Majesty, the lord chancellor or the lord chief justice \u2026 The lord chancellor and lord chief justice make sure policies are in place to protect the welfare of judicial office holders.\u201d The hearing continues. Judgment is expected to be reserved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
