The university is throwing its intellectual weight behind the move to shift Northern Ireland's economic future from a public sector-dependent economy to a globally competitive knowledge based economy. The university has built a world class reputation in technology and at home its role in science park development, incubator companies and other wealth creating innovations is seen as a model for stimulating economic growth. The Lambert Review, commissioned by Chancellor Gordon Brown, cites the example of Belfast company James Leckey Design which, in partnership with the university's school of engineering, has introduced new products and improved production processes. The university was established in 1984 by the merger of the New University of Ulster and the Ulster Polytechnic. Since then, it has expanded rapidly from around 10,000 students to approximately 25,000 students and 3,500 staff. Ulster's MSc programme in disaster relief nursing is the first in the world to be developed through the collaboration of international educational institutions and multinational aid relief organisations in the UK, Finland, Republic of Ireland, Sweden and Spain. The programme provides students with the necessary skills and knowledge to lead multinational teams involved in healthcare at the world's disaster zones. It is a multinational course that is taken simultaneously by nurses in different countries. Ulster's MA in applied arts is aimed at self-reliant graduates looking for a challenging postgraduate programme to develop their work to professional standards. The course provides a useful basis for grasping the vagaries of professional life by providing a business studies module. And the university's MA in culture and identity in Ireland explores cultural traditions north and south of the border. For application details on any of its postgraduate programmes, contact the University of Ulster at Coleraine, Cromore Road, Co. Londonderry, BT52 1SA. Nick says: \"The university's MSc in professional and management development for women is aimed at budding female managers keen to supercharge their careers. The idea is to boost women's access to technological functions and executive roles in the public and private sectors.\" Nick Pandya (nick.pandya@theguardian.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
