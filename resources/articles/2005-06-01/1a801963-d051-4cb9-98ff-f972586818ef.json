But we share the view that there can be no consensus worth having if women's needs in retirement are not addressed. Two-thirds of pensioners are women, yet their retirement income is less than two-thirds of men's. One in four single women pensioners live in poverty. Only 16% of women receive a full state pension in their own right. A quarter of all women aged between 45 and 64 are carers, with a quarter of them also caring for children. Significantly, an EOC poll published earlier this year showed that four out of five people want carers to have the same state pension rights as those who have been in paid work. Currently, most of that caring goes unrecognised by the pensions system. We want to see pensions reform that puts independence and equality at its heart. We want to see pensions reform that increases women's entitlement to the state pension, that properly recognises unpaid caring work and achieves certainty and simplicity in the state pension to ensure stability, simplification and transparency in the pensions system as a whole, encouraging saving and planning for retirement. We also want to see pensions reform that closes the gap between women and men in state, private and occupational pensions, that works for current and future generations of women pensioners and addresses the lack of representation of black and ethnic minority women in the state pension system. The reality is women's working lives are more complex than men's. But if we get it right for women pensioners, we'll get it right for everyone.
