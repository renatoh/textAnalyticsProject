Banks, who gave \u00a312m of services to the campaign, becoming the biggest donor in UK history, has repeatedly denied any involvement with Russian officials, or that Russian money played any part in the Brexit campaign. The Observer has seen documents which a senior Tory MP says, if correct, raise urgent and troubling questions about his relationship with the Russian government. The communications suggest: \u2022 Multiple meetings between the leaders of Leave.EU and high-ranking Russian officials, from November 2015 to 2017. \u2022 Two meetings in the week Leave.EU launched its official campaign. \u2022 An introduction to a Russian businessman, by the Russian ambassador, the day after Leave.EU launched its campaign, who reportedly offered Banks a multibillion dollar opportunity to buy Russian goldmines. \u2022 A trip to Moscow in February 2016 to meet key partners and financiers behind a gold project, including a Russian bank. \u2022 Continued extensive contact in the run-up to the US election when Banks, his business partner and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore, and Nigel Farage campaigned in the US to support Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. Banks and Wigmore \u2013 who was also present at many of the meetings \u2013 were due to appear before the select committee for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on Tuesday to answer questions about Leave.EU\u2019s role in the European referendum. Hours after the Observer contacted them for comment on Friday, they published a letter stating they would not attend the hearing, and accused the committee of colluding with a pro-Remain campaign group. But on Saturday Banks suggested that he would attend after all, and accused the Tory chairman, Damian Collins, of colluding with journalists. Controversy has grown over Russia\u2019s alleged interference in a series of key polls, including the election of Donald Trump, last year\u2019s French presidential elections and the Brexit referendum, to secure outcomes favourable to President Putin. Putin has long seen the eastward expansion of EU influence as a threat. Towards the end of last year, Banks issued a statement saying his contacts with \u201cthe Russians\u201d consisted of \u201cone boozy lunch\u201d at the Russian embassy. Documents seen by the Observer, suggest a different version of events. From November 2015, the ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, courted Banks and Wigmore, inviting them to multiple events and meetings in the run-up to the European referendum, many of which, the documents suggest, they attended. On 16 November, the documents suggest, Yakovenko invited them to an evening meeting at the Russian embassy. It is not clear if a meeting happened on that date. On 17 November 2015, Banks did meet the Russian ambassador, who introduced him to a Russian businessman with extensive business interests in Russian goldmines, according to documents seen by the Observer. It is understood Banks was presented with a business opportunity in which he was offered a chance to invest in a plan to buy six Russian gold firms and merge them into a single entity, potentially netting a profit of several billion dollars. On 18 November 2015, the day after the meeting, Leave.EU held its launch event \u2013 with Brittany Kaiser of Cambridge Analytica. Documents seen by the Observer suggest further meetings and discussions took place between the businessman and Banks and Wigmore, including a trip to Moscow in February 2016 during which Banks was scheduled to meet high-level officials from the state-owned bank. The deal to buy the goldmines with funding from the bank was announced on 5 July 2016, 12 days after the referendum. It is not clear if Banks invested, although he tweeted on 17 July 2016 : \u201cI am buying gold at the moment &amp; big mining stocks.\u201d There is no public record of Banks being an investor in it. According to the documents seen by the Observer, the hospitality extended both ways with Banks and Wigmore inviting the ambassador and a senior Russian diplomat to attend an evening with business contacts in a pub, and even to watch the results of the referendum at Leave.EU headquarters in Millbank, although the ambassador said he had to decline because of commitments in Moscow. The invitations continued after the referendum during the time in which Banks, Wigmore and Farage began travelling regularly to America to support Donald Trump\u2019s bid for the presidency, according to the documents. Ambassador Yakovenko met Wigmore and Banks on 19 August, the day Steve Bannon became Trump\u2019s campaign manager. It was days before they travelled to Mississippi with Nigel Farage for a rally on 25 August at which Donald Trump introduced him to the crowds as \u201cMr Brexit\u201d. He said a Trump presidency would be \u201cBrexit plus\u201d. Wigmore declined to comment on any of the allegations the Observer put to him. The Observer submitted questions to Banks on Friday morning. He said initially he needed more time \u201cto check his diary and office computer\u201d. He repeatedly refused to comment, though last night he reportedly downplayed the significance of the meetings and denied that Russian officials sought to influence his Leave.EU referendum campaign. The Russian Embassy told the Observer: \u201cThe Russian Embassy has not in any way intervened in domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum. Meeting stakeholders representing all political spectrum of the host country is a natural element of the work of any embassy.\u201d Collins, the chair of the select committee for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: \u201cRussia is not our friend. And this new material raises questions of the most serious nature. If deals were brokered with Russian government help, it would raise urgent questions about Russian interference in our democracy. We urgently need Arron Banks to answer these and other questions. People will wonder if this is the real reason he has cancelled his appearance before the committee.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 December 2018 to clarify dates. Banks had a meeting with the Russian ambassador on 17 November 2015 and the Leave.EU launch event was held on 18 November 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
