It\u2019s hard to watch something like this unfold when it feels like there is no real leadership to help guide the country through \u2013 but watching the stories out of Texas reminded me that the actual leadership is there, among the citizens who helped each other. Even the reporters who covered the disaster found ways to help \u2013 from a CNN correspondent who saved a man and tried to give a woman with Alzheimer\u2019s some privacy from the camera, to local reporters who stayed to cover the storm even when it meant putting their own safety at risk. The first responders and the people saving animals. Business owners who opened their doors to people seeking refuge. They all gave me hope; a feeling I think we could all use a little more of these days. Glass Half Full Amidst the destruction in Texas, humanity found a way to shine through again and again. There have been so many stories of bravery, but this one, in which neighbors formed a human chain to help a woman in labor, has stuck with me. What I\u2019m RTing Who I\u2019m reading Raw Story on the Oklahoma police chief who turned out to be an active white supremacist; Vanity Fair on poor Ivanka and Jared and their hard transition to DC and some much-needed levity and loveliness from Josh Gondelman on writing his wedding vows and the fear of bombing. What I\u2019m writing So much for Ivanka Trump saving us all from her father\u2019s extremism. Just when women could have used her influence, she bailed. How outraged I am A nurse in Utah was arrested and manhandled by a police officer for doing her job - protecting one of her patients. No scale of one to 10, just rage today. How I\u2019m making it through this week My favorite baby hippo and yours, Fiona, has her own TV show. It launches on Facebook next week, if you can wait until then!
