It is written in Sanskrit and dedicated to his family: \"Beautiful, Blessed, Strong, Intelligent.\" Beautiful for his sister, Hollie, blessed for his father, Don, strong for his brother, Ashley, and intelligent for his mother, Lynn. \"I just wanted to do something nice for them,\" he says. And, Walcott being Walcott, he left himself off because, well, it just did not feel right to pick an epithet for himself. The wonderkid is 20 now, no longer the baby of the football world that everybody thinks him. Yes, he has the star player's accessories: the nice watch, the designer T-shirt, the diamond studs. But, even now, there is an innocence about him. To borrow that famous old lyric, he comes straight outta Compton; that is,Compton in Berkshire, a village of one pub, one shop and one football field. Everyone seems to know one another in Compton. \"My little village is fantastic,\" Walcott says with a smile. His girlfriend, Melanie Slade, was once tailed by a photographer all the way from Southampton. \"We were going for a meal so all my neighbours came out and basically surrounded his car, blocked him in with their cars and bikes, so he couldn't move and couldn't get his picture. We left, then they let him go.\" Then there was the day in 2006 when he was included in Sven-Goran Eriksson's World Cup squad. So many villagers made their way to his house Don had to tape a sign to the gate asking them to return at 6pm when Theo would be home and able to sign autographs. \"There was a queue from the front door all the way down the road, as far as you could see,\" Walcott remembers, shaking his head. \"It felt like the entire village had turned out.\" Walcott has always been taken aback by the adulation he creates, the way adults shout his name and grab for his hand, the way young boys rush to him and then fall silent and shy once up close. And yet he is young enough to have his own heroes. His eyes still widen, for example, when Thierry Henry is mentioned. The Frenchman always seemed untouchable until, in pre-season, his former club had their 40-metre sprint tests. \"I did it in 4.7 seconds,\" Walcott says. \"I think Thierry's club record was 4.82 or 4.84. He probably won't be too happy.\" The frustration for Arsenal fans is that they have yet to see that scorching pace this season. Walcott has been suffering from a persistent back injury after a virtually non-stop summer in which, to the consternation of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Football Association asked him to double up for England's Under-21s in their European Championship finals as well as for the senior team in World Cup qualifiers. Walcott is, at least, in line to return to the squad for the Champions League match against Standard Li\u00e8ge on Wednesday, but Wenger believes the summer exertions have not been fair on the player or his club. Walcott's own view is that he wanted to play, regardless of the politics. \"If I'm called up by any England team I'm willing to go. I'm not going to pull out of any England team. Ask any young kid who wants to play for their national team and everyone's the same. We're all dying to do it. I wanted to go and I let Arsenal and England deal with everything else. I left that battle to them.\" Events, like Walcott, have moved at speed. He is encouraged by what he has seen of Arsenal going into today's game at Manchester City. Then, on Wednesday, Capello's side qualified for the World Cup and Walcott could be forgiven for wondering about the next chapter in his England story. You know the one \u2013 the story of the boy who was picked for the World Cup but never got a game; the kid who became an easy target when everything went wrong. The first time I came across Walcott he was wandering around Baden-Baden with a video camera, filming his own diary, looking every bit the tourist. He had just turned 17 and had not made a single first-team appearance for Arsenal. Eriksson had not even seen him play when he picked him for the squad and, when it came down to it, he did not have the nerve to go through with his gamble. Walcott did not get a minute on the pitch. His own memories are like those of so many others, predominantly bemusement. \"It was all new to me. I watched that diary a couple of weeks ago and it was funny seeing what I looked like \u2013 this little baby-face. I definitely felt like a kid. I hadn't even had the chance to play in the Premier League so the call-up was an absolute shock. But I didn't pick the squad, did I? It was like I was on holiday really.\" A holiday? \"At times. The diary is fantastic to watch because at times I was frustrated at not playing. The staff and manager were saying I was doing well in training but I never got the chance to play. So it was quite frustrating. But I didn't expect to go there and do wonders. The idea was to train, learn my trade and see how I got on. [Jermaine] Jenas didn't get the chance to play either, but everyone forgets about that.\" Walcott certainly has better credentials to be in South Africa. He had \"no right\" to go to Germany in 2006, Steven Gerrard volunteered in his autobiography. Sir Alex Ferguson stated recently that he \"still could not understand it\". Dave Whelan, the Wigan chairman, called Walcott \"basically the ballboy\". But the player has always been able to flash that disarming smile and laugh it off. \"It doesn't bother me at all. I was only 17 and still developing so, yeah, I probably shouldn't have gone. Everyone has their own opinion but I was absolutely delighted. You will have to ask Sven why. But now I feel it was the right decision. It's paid off because I feel like I've played well for England.\" The boy has become a man. The highlight of England's current qualifying campaign was indisputably Walcott's hat-trick in the 4-1 win in Croatia a year and two days ago. Yet the people who know Walcott best will also attest there is far more to him than just body swerve and pace. He has been back to his old school to help the kids. He has attached himself to all sorts of charity projects, even a campaign encouraging more enlightened attitudes to breastfeeding (because he was sick of his sister getting dirty looks). An enthusiastic computer game player, he was boyishly delighted to discover he would be alongside Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard on the cover of EA Sports FIFA 10 when it is released next month. Wenger has suggested he could become the most feared attacker on the planet. Yet there are no signs of the fame going to his head. \"My friends, family and girlfriend have all helped, but I'm a level-headed guy anyway. I haven't changed at all. People always think it's about money, money, money but I just want to win trophies. Ryan Giggs is the perfect example for me, the amount of medals he's won. You want to look back on your career and see what you've achieved, not just have a fancy car and a big house.\" Surely he must enjoy the occasional night on the town? \"I will go out and have some fun. You can't lock yourself away forever. But it's not me you'll see stumbling out of nightclubs.\" He brings up Giggs again. \"It's not so much that he's been at one club all his career, more that you don't see him on the front pages. It's the way he talks to people, the way he deals with the pressure every day. He is like an ambassador for his club.\" Remarkably grounded, Walcott is an impressive spokesman for his own club, too. The perception going into this season was that Arsenal were the most vulnerable of the big four. Yet Walcott believes there is clear evidence that Arsenal are not going to be a soft touch. \"That's the thing we've learned. The way we've played so far, it's been great to see how we've coped with the physical battle. A lot of people think you just have to kick Arsenal and they will shy out of tackles. Other teams have tried that but this year I don't think it's going to work. We've had a couple of years to learn and we're there to cope with the physical battle now. I definitely feel more capable of standing up to it. A lot of players have come on. Alex Song, Den\u00edlson \u2013 they've really come out of their shells. [Thomas] Vermaelen looks a fantastic addition.\" But can they actually win anything? \"Because it's been so long, I think it's actually brought us closer together. Four years is a long time without a trophy. But we'll be OK. We just have to get results to shut people up.\" Theo Walcott will appear in EA SPORTS FIFA 10, out on all formats from 2 October.
