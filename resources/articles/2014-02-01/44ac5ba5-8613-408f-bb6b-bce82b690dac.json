Mehldau mostly plays old-school synths and Fender Rhodes keys, spinning melodic fragments into distant spaces to be replaced by grouchy low-end hooks and snare patterns, striking chirping treble melodies over chanting children's voices, planting steady, pop-song chord figures under acoustic themes laced with catlike whines. Tense, jostling pieces such as Hungry Ghost and Just Call Me Nige thinly disguise all the pianist's familiar improv resourcefulness inside the zooming sound effects, and the remarkable Guiliana balances drum-machine remorselessness with dazzling improv receptivity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
