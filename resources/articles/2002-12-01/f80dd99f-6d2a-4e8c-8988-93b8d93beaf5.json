The news comes amid rumours that Kevin Keegan, manager of the Sky Blues, is considering his future after the club's board denied him funds to buy new players. City's chairman David Bernstein said last week: 'We remain as ambitious as Kevin but we are restrained by certain realities.' Keegan has spent over \u00a330m on 15 players during his 18-month tenure, including \u00a313.5m on the striker Nicolas Anelka, a club record. City also made a \u00a37m write-down on the value of its squad, partly as a reflection of the depressed transfer market. But there are bright spots. The club's income fell last year because it was relegated to the first division. It has since returned to the Premiership, and is moving to a new ground. If City avoids relegation this season, Bernstein predicts that once in the new stadium it will double turnover to \u00a360m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
