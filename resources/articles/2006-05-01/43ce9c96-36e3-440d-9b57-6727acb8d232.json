Mr De Villepin is alleged to have used a senior intelligence official in an intricate plot to smear his rival and presidential contender Nicolas Sarkozy. The scandal, which threatens to undermine Jacques Chirac's last year as president, began in the summer of 2004 when an anonymous source wrote to a judge accusing Mr Sarkozy and other politicians and businessmen of holding secret bank accounts with the Luxembourg bank Clearstream. The accounts were said to hold kickbacks from the $2.8bn (\u00a31.5bn) sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991. But the judge soon discovered that the allegations were false and the accounts did not exist. Mr Sarkozy, then finance minister, complained that the affair had been used to discredit him. A judicial inquiry has since tried to find out who wrote the letter and whether there was a smear campaign. Both Mr De Villepin and Mr Chirac have denied any role in a plot. The saga took a further twist last weekend, when Le Monde published a leak of the sworn testimony of General Philippe Rondot, a retired intelligence officer, which suggested that Mr De Villepin, acting on the orders of the president, had asked the agent to dig up information on Mr Sarkozy. Gen Rondot said Mr Sarkozy's name came up in a meeting with Mr De Villepin, then interior minister, in January 2004. Investigators had confiscated Gen Rondot's notes on the conversation, including one that read: \"Political stake: N Sarkozy. Fixation on Sarkozy (re: conflict J Chirac/N Sarkozy).\" Mr Chirac and Mr Sarkozy have often been at odds over recent years, and Mr De Villepin has long been considered the president's preferred successor. Mr De Villepin has denied any dirty tricks, saying the French state \"never had another goal but to defend national security and the interests of our country\". Mr Chirac also issued a denial. But newspapers said the question of whether Mr De Villepin should resign had been posed in political circles. A number of politicians have urged Mr Chirac to act by distancing himself from Mr De Villepin or by calling for early elections. Julien Dray, a spokesman for the Socialist party, said: \"The head of state should take measure of what is happening. Perhaps he should separate right away from his prime minister, perhaps he should envisage new elections.\" The offices of the defence minister have already been searched in the course of the inquiry and the media is speculating that Mr De Villepin could be questioned by investigating judges. The Socialist party's Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned of \"the scandalous use of the secret service, a sort of French Watergate\". He told a TV channel that Mr De Villepin, Mr Chirac and Mr Sarkozy were \"a diabolical threesome\" destroying France's image. Mr Sarkozy faces a key test today as parliament begins debating his immigration bill, which has been described by church leaders, immigrant support groups and the left as a xenophobic drive for far-right votes ahead of next year's presidential election. Tough new measures will focus on what Mr Sarkozy calls \"selective immigration\", and will also force newcomers to take lessons in the language and civic studies. At a Paris demonstration against the bill, Dosso Soualiho, who runs an immigrant collective, said: \"They talk about French lessons, but look at all of us workers from west Africa here who are denied residency. We all speak French because we were colonised by the French ... They don't want to give us any rights here because we're black.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
