If Sunderland have aspirations of remaining in the top flight drastic changes must be made before the transfer window closes on Friday night. Keane is still targeting \"three or four\" new players but, on this evidence, he could do with an entire new squad. Luton enjoyed their first reward after 16 minutes when David Bell delivered with a rasping free-kick. Keane will have been furious at the way his players turned their back as Bell took the kick. Furlong doubled the lead on 43 minutes when the 38-year-old received Alan Goodall's long pass forward, ghosted past Nyron Nosworthy and lobbed neatly over Darren Ward in the Sunderland goal. Sunderland were much livelier at the start of the second period but when Drew Talbot chased a long ball Greg Halford was booked for pulling him back. Halford then had to hack away a Bell shot as Luton continued to frustrate their opponents and when Grant Leadbitter had a chance to halve the deficit after 57 minutes his left-foot shot flew wide. Sunderland were in further trouble when Halford was sent off on the hour for his second bookable offence, a totally unnecessary deliberate handball.Fifteen minutes later, Furlong struck again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
