It is the subtle balance of ingredients that make it a real treat. The bun to filling ratio is important; about one small lobster or crayfish should makes six rolls. The crucial aspect of the serving of these is the timing. When you plan on serving the rolls, have all your prepared ingredients lined up on the bench ready to go. As the toasted buns come from the oven, quickly build your lobster rolls. The magic is in the contrasting temperatures \u2013 quickly serving the rolls means that the warm buns are filled with the cool sweet lobster and mayonnaise. This is one of the most popular dishes we make and we\u2019ve kept making it because I suspect there might be a riot if we tried to take it off the menu. There\u2019s something about the way the kewpie mayonnaise and the bun get together that just seems to hit a particular bliss spot. Local lobster, freshly cooked, is really the only way to go here. If you don\u2019t want to cook the lobster yourself, you can get it from your fishmonger \u2014 just check ahead so that you can be sure it has been freshly cooked. 1 lobster tail in its shell 1 red Asian shallot 1/2 bunch watercress 125g kewpie mayonnaise 2 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp white wine vinegar 1 tsp mustard powder 60ml olive oil 4 brioche buns 40g butter, softened Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium until the water is at a constant simmer. Poach the lobster tail in its shell in the simmering water for about 8\u201310 minutes. Remove the lobster from the pan and set aside to cool. Place in the refrigerator until chilled. Shell the lobster and slice the meat into eight discs. Finely chop any small or discoloured pieces of lobster you may have. Cut the shallot in half lengthways and thinly slice each half. Pick the watercress, discarding any bruised or tarnished leaves, then wash and pat dry. Combine the kewpie mayonnaise, lemon juice, vinegar and mustard powder in a mixing bowl. Slowly add the oil while whisking continuously. Season to taste. Preheat the oven to 180C. Cut the brioche buns in half horizontally and lightly butter them. Put the buns on a tray, butter side down, and toast them in the oven for five minutes or until golden brown. Spread 1 teaspoon of the mayonnaise on to each half of the brioche. Place a tablespoon of chopped lobster on the bottom halves and season to taste. Arrange two discs of lobster meat on top without overlapping. Place \u00bd teaspoon mayonnaise on each lobster slice and season again to taste. Add a few slices of shallot and a few leaves of watercress, place the brioche lid on the top and serve immediately.
