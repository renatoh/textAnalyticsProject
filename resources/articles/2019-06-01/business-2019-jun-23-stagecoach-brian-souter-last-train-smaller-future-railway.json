Its American dream has ended, and it faces a final departure from the UK railway network it once dominated. The City may not be entirely distraught to see the transport group\u2019s forced exit from rail \u2013 even if that means saying goodbye to Virgin Trains on the west coast, which has showered the two Sirs (Virgin\u2019s Sir Richard Branson and Sir Brian Souter, Stagecoach\u2019s co-founder) with vast dividends since privatisation. Elsewhere in the business, losses piled up on the short-lived Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, and it only looks to be a matter of time before other train operators see their contracts follow Virgin\u2019s down the Swanee. Investors may well feel that if being barred from the East Midlands and Southeastern franchise competitions is the price to pay for refusing to guarantee workers\u2019 pensions, so be it. Stagecoach\u2019s rival National Express has already kicked the British rail habit, and its chief executive, Dean Finch, is reputedly happier and richer for it. Meanwhile, FirstGroup\u2019s biggest shareholders, having secured an emergency meeting on Tuesday, are still threatening to sue the board rather than see them accept another cash-chomping rail franchise. Yet Stagecoach looks as though it will have trouble going cold turkey, and continues to throw lawyers at the Department for Transport in the franchising dispute. While few normal citizens could fathom the deep joy or pain inside chairman Souter, perhaps this speaks to a deeper need. Could the Stagecoach billionaire really be satisfied, after decades hobnobbing with Branson on flash Virgin trains and lobbing dollars around the US, to see his firm reduced to a future of buses trundling around our small island? Many a transport journalist will, like Souter, have occasionally experienced the glitz of a press launch with Branson \u2013 even with that slightly uneasy feeling of wondering whether this cash might have been better taxed onshore, or if he should put that model in the bikini down now. Take away that kind of expensive jazz, and you\u2019re just another grumpy middle-aged man left to obsess about buses. Stagecoach\u2019s website still bangs on about it being a multimodal transport provider. Its co-founder, Souter\u2019s sister Dame Ann Gloag, once snapped up a briefly functioning airport at Manston. But in a few short months, the only shred of multimodality in the group will be provided by the Sheffield supertram, whose Rotherham extension is best known for costing five times its budget and sparking a parliamentary inquiry. Stagecoach used to talk about spanning five continents, but it flogged its last foreign outpost this year, selling its American coach operations at a knockdown price. Having long abandoned whatever it was it did on the other three continents, the company\u2019s horizons look about as limited as the rest of Brexit Britain\u2019s. Another fly in the Stagecoach ointment could conceivably come on Monday, when Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, announces plans for the city\u2019s transport network. However, his early ambition to regulate the private bus operators\u2019 lucrative activity \u2013 the biggest potential incursion into the sector for decades \u2013 looks to have dissipated. The British bus, always by far the most profitable vehicle for the group, should continue to fill Souter\u2019s coffers for some time yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
