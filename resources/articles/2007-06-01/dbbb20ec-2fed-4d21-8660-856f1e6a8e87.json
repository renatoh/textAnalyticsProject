Self-critical irony was one of them. \"I started playing clay-court tennis,\" she said. \"It was kind of interesting to find myself three break-points down. I needed to adapt as soon as possible.\" She did that by ensuring she got in the first big hit more often than her opponent, an American qualifier who had developed some respectable grass-court form. Despite the noisy, almost blustering, style with which she tries to bully opponents, the 20-year-old Russian has a cerebral side which makes her one of the least likely to panic. Today she faces a 16-year-old Austrian, Tamira Paszek. \"She did well in the juniors,\" Sharapova said. \"I can't underestimate her tomorrow.\" Another ambitious teenager, Naomi Cavaday, came to a sudden halt. The 18-year-old left-hander who is Britain's best female prospect had been rousingly aggressive on Tuesday in beating Vasilisa Bardina, ranked 61st in the world, but faced with the experienced and idiosyncratic Marion Bartoli yesterday she was consistently denied the chance to impose her heavy weapons. It did not help that her first match on a centre court against a top-20 player in front of her home crowd was against one of the very few to hit with two hands on both wings. It meant that during a 6-3, 6-1 defeat the teenager from Kent often found it very difficult to spot which direction the ball was going to head."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
