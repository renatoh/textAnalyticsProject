Nevin, the former Chelsea and Scotland winger, insisted that the departure of Davies had not been the result of a trigger-happy regime pressing the panic button. The Lanarkshire club dropped to the foot of the Scottish Premier League on Sunday after a 3-0 away defeat by Rangers. But despite a winless opening seven games, the chairman John Boyle insisted that it was Davies who had offered his resignation in return for a settlement package. He said: \"Pat Nevin, Billy and myself had a meeting this morning at which Billy agreed that it would be in the best interests of the club if he were to relinquish his position. We accepted his decision and he is leaving on amicable terms.\" Nevin added: \"The way it happened was not the way everyone seems to think. Billy and I were yesterday in negotiations to bring in a player and were due to meet him and his agent today.\" Nevin said that the new man would be given until the end of the season at least to turn the club's fortunes around. \"I am very confident of getting the right person,\" he added. \"There are already a lot of people interested in the job and I am really encouraged by that. We have had four or five serious enquiries from some interesting names.\" The team affairs will be handled by the assistant manager Miodrag Krivokapic and coach John Philliben until the new manager is appointed. Davies had succeeded Harri Kampman three years ago. But despite keeping them in the top flight, he had a record of only 41 wins from 136 games. A year ago there was no feeling of a crisis at Fir Park. They were not in danger of relegation and were one of the few sides who managed to hold the all-conquering Celtic to a draw in the league. But when the chairman decided on a policy change, the fortunes of both the team and the manager dipped. Boyle had invested heavily in players who were hardly household names - but well-known nonetheless - in a bid to make the club the third force behind Celtic and Rangers. But the gamble has failed to pay off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
