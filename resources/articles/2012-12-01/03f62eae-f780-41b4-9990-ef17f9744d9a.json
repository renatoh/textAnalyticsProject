Ronaldo appeared in two finals with United, the win on penalties over Chelsea in 2008, when he missed from the spot in Moscow having earlier scored with a header, and the 2009 meeting with Barcelona in Rome, where they lost 2-0. The visit of Real also sees the return of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to the ground where he made his name in this country in 2004, creating an enduring image when racing down the touchline in his overcoat to celebrate Porto's last-minute equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw which won the last-16 tie 3\u20132 on aggregate. The opening leg will be played at the Bernab\u00e9u on 13 February before the return on 5 March, and Ferguson said: \"It's the tie of the round. It's a great opportunity for our fans to see Cristiano again and also for me to meet up with Jos\u00e9 again \u2013 I'll need to order some good wine.\" Ronaldo departed United in an \u00a380m world-record transfer in 2009 having won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups, as well as the Ballon D'or and world player of the year awards. Now 27, Ronaldo joined United from Sporting Lisbon in 2003 and went on to score 118 goals in 292 games during six seasons. He was also voted the FWA and PFA footballer of the year in 2006 and 2007. United have met Real four times in the European Cup with the last of them in 2003, when the Brazilian Ronaldo was applauded off by the Old Trafford crowd after scoring a hat-trick to secure Madrid's place in the semi-final, 6-5 on aggregate. Rio Ferdinand, who played in the 2003 tie between the clubs, reacted to the draw on Twitter, saying: \"Oh yes, Madrid!! What a great couple a games that'll be!! @Cristiano see u soon bro!!\" Emilio Butrague\u00f1o, Real Madrid's former striker and director of public relations, said the two managers and Ronaldo will relish the fixture. \"He's a great professional. I'm sure he's going to do his best to help us qualify. It's going to be very, very special for him. \"It will be a thrilling experience for everyone. Manchester United are not only a great team but a great organisation known around the world. But we know it's going to be tough, Sir Alex Ferguson has been there over 25 years and he's a fantastic manager \u2013 he knows how to get the best out of his players and they have top players, but we are Real Madrid and we will try our best. \"I know the coaches have a great relationship. We are very happy with him [Mourinho] and I hope he's going to lead the team to the Champions League to make our fans feel proud of the team.\" The precise state of the relationship between Ferguson and Mourinho was recently called into question when Sir Bobby Charlton, a club director, claimed the Scot \"doesn't like him too much\", and the Portuguese leads the Scot in head-to-heads, having won six times to Ferguson's three, with five draws. Arsenal's tie with Bayern Munich is also a tough proposition for the other English club remaining in the competition. The Gunners defender Per Mertesacker said: \"We will face a good team in Germany. They are top of the league and went through to the knockout stage in a phenomenal way. They have the advantage with the second game being at home. We're looking forward to it. \"I think Lukas Podolski and me especially are looking forward to it because we want to go back to Germany and win games for our new team.\" Bayern lost last season's final on penalties to Chelsea and Podolski said: \"It's a big club but we have the chance to win against Bayern Munich.\" Of his team's meeting with the Italian champions Juventus, the Celtic manager Neil Lennon said: \"It is a very glamorous tie. They are a very good side and very consistent. If you look at the Italian team that got to the final of the European Championship, the majority of them were Juventus players. \"They have been together for a while, they have been building this team for a few years. They beat Chelsea 3-0 \u2013 not many teams do that. \"I'm assuming most people would back them over the two games but we are used to that anyway.\" There was further intrigue when all eight ties precisely matched the draw executed in Wednesday's rehearsal at Uefa's Nyon headquarters in Switzerland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
