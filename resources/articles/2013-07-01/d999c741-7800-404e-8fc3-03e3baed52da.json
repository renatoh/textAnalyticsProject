Walking more fascinating. Buses more scenic. And cars are more comfortable. But Mark Carney was smart to take the tube to work on his first day as governor of the Bank of England. By emerging out of Bank station before 7am, Mr Carney did not just beat the photographers. He also showed a neat populist touch for a man whose pay deal puts him on another planet from most of his fellow passengers. London is increasingly two cities \u2013 the very rich and the rest \u2013 and not enough of the former use the tube, so Mr Carney is setting a good example to those who think themselves too grand to take what is often the quickest way of getting around. Londoners like to moan about the tube, often with good reason. But there could be no better reminder of the reality of \"we're all in this together\" than a journey to work wedged between fellow commuters on the Central line on, at last, a hot summer's day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
