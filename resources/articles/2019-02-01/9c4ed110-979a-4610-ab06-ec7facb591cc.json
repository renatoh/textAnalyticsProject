The 47-year-old officially left his position at the FA on Monday after tendering his resignation in September and immediately takes up a similar role back in the Premier League with Brighton. His six-year stint with the national set-up was marked by the move to the national football centre at St George\u2019s Park. The senior England men\u2019s and women\u2019s sides reached semi-finals at major tournaments, while the U17s and U20s won their respective World Cups and the U19s claimed the European Championships in 2017. Ashworth, who had previously been West Bromwich Albion\u2019s technical director, was in Russia last summer to witness Gareth Southgate\u2019s side progress to the semi-finals for the first time in 28 years. \u201cIn the back of my mind that may well have moved my decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we landed on the runway coming back from Russia \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget this \u2013 it occurred to me that it would be another four and a half years before we did this again. \u201cIt was emotionally quite difficult to get back into home life, family life, normal life while realising there was still a fair chunk of time before we had another go at competing in football\u2019s ultimate tournament: a World Cup. It was difficult but in a nice way. I\u2019d much rather have that than come back as we have after some other tournaments. But after six years I\u2019d missed the day-to-day part of being at a football club: the transfer windows, seeing players and coaches every day and seeing your team compete once or twice a week.\u201d Les Reed, the former head of football development and vice-chairman of football at Southampton, was appointed as Ashworth\u2019s successor in December and has already taken up his duties at St George\u2019s Park. Ashworth, for his part, will begin work at the Lancing training complex in Brighton on Tuesday. \u201cI always felt I\u2019d go back into club football one day,\u201d he added. \u201cMy last three jobs have all been between five and six years. Maybe that\u2019s me. Maybe every five or six years I need a new challenge. \u201cI\u2019ve read [my decision] is about money, but I\u2019ve never been money driven, it\u2019s got nothing to do with that. I left West Brom to come to England for less. It\u2019s got nothing to do with that, or whether I believe England can win or will continue [progressing]. If I\u2019d left it for another four and a half years then I\u2019d have been at the FA for ten and a half years. That\u2019s a big chunk away from club football. All those things were going round in my mind, so it seemed the right time, and the right opportunity, to leave with good experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s about my own career and my own personal job satisfaction. I\u2019ve loved every minute of this job. I don\u2019t regret for a minute taking it. I\u2019ve really, really enjoyed it. There are no push factors from this job. But it\u2019s time for me, and maybe time for the organisation, to have a fresh set of eyes on it and a new challenge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
