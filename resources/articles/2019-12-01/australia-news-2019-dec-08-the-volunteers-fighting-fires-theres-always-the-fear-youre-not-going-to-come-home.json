The paddocks around central west New South Wales look golden from a distance, but are crispy and brown underfoot. Wind has been howling for days, stirring up red dust on the horizon. Severe fire conditions are looming; it\u2019s only the beginning of summer. Volunteers from the Rural Fire Service in Eglinton, on the outskirts of Bathurst, have been called to a fire in steep terrain about 60 kilometres away. On a Wednesday evening their colleagues await their return at the station, Christmas lights twinkling under the eaves. Clint Bawden, 81, is among them, having only recently retired as an active firefighter. Now he does odd jobs around the station, but Bawden says firefighting is in his blood. His father worked for the Forestry Corporation and took him to fire fronts as a child. \u201cI used to wag school and go to every fire,\u201d Bawden says, his stories marked by a twinkle in his eyes. He says he was 12 when he went to a blaze on the NSW south coast, which sent people fleeing to Wairo Beach. \u201cThere was a guy there who had a brand new Cadillac and we said, \u2018You\u2019d better run it down to the beach\u2019. He said, \u2018I can\u2019t, it\u2019s got no fuel\u2019. \u201cSomeone yelled out \u2018Have you got a bottle of scotch?\u2019. So he tipped some scotch in and fired it up and that was the only thing that was saved. \u201cIt was a 1950 Cadillac. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d The Eglinton brigade is made up of men and women of all ages. There are mechanics, bakers, an accountant, a university student, and many are parents to young children. Locals have decorated a shrub outside the station, a printed sign saying: \u201cThank you to our fireys\u201d. Recently neighbours have delivered homemade cakes to show their gratitude. That sentiment stretches across drought-stricken NSW, amid a fierce bushfire season that started weeks before summer began. Catastrophic conditions \u2013 the worst possible fire weather \u2013 were declared during a heatwave in November and almost 600 schools were closed in eastern parts of the state. Six people have died, hundreds of homes have been destroyed. Enormous fires burn across NSW into December and millions of people in cities and towns have been breathing smoky, polluted air for weeks. The conditions are playing out just as fire and weather experts feared. Earlier this year, 23 former fire and emergency chiefs from around Australia called for stronger action on climate change, predicting longer fire seasons and more frequent catastrophic fire conditions. In late October, deputy state coroner Carmel Forbes handed down her findings into a fire near Dunedoo, east of Dubbo, which burnt through 55,000 hectares, destroyed 35 homes, and killed thousands of animals in February 2017. The inquiry was requested by the RFS to help people understand the incredible danger posed by catastrophic conditions, in which no home is designed to withstand the aggressive, uncontrollable fires fanned by extremely hot and dry weather. The findings described how pyro-convective columns, which can trigger \u201cfire storms\u201d, were once rare but are now more frequent. Such storms were a feature of deadly fires in Victoria in 2009, and the Canberra fires in 2003. \u201cThe climate is changing and we are getting more extreme fire behaviour as a result as the atmosphere is hotter and more unstable,\u201d Dr Simon Heemstra, a fire behaviour expert from the RFS, told the inquiry. The coroner also heard from farmers about what they felt was poor communication from the RFS, poor decisions, lack of resources and their sense of \u201cisolation\u201d as they stared down walls of fire. The group of former emergency chiefs has called for a parliamentary inquiry into whether emergency services including the RFS \u2013 made up of 70,000 volunteers and about 1,000 paid staff \u2013 are adequately resourced to respond to the growing threat. Ken Thompson, a former deputy commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and representative of the Australian Firefighters Climate Alliance, says Australia is seeing longer fire seasons, which overlap with those in the northern hemisphere. \u201cI don\u2019t think our firefighting system was ever designed for the scale and magnitude of events that we\u2019re seeing at the moment \u2013 that goes for all agencies involved in firefighting and land management,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe world has changed, the climate has changed, but we\u2019re in an old paradigm \u2013 these fires are burning hotter and faster.\u201d Back in Eglinton, those broader concerns are not the immediate focus for the crew returning from the blaze near Sofala, an old gold-mining village. Faces and hands black with soot, their eyes drooping with exhaustion, they are frustrated \u2013 after seven hours of work they have not been able to control a fire burning in extremely challenging countryside. Tanya Willey, a deputy captain, wipes ash from the bridge of her nose as she describes her responsibility to protect the brigade. \u201cThere\u2019s always that fear that when you go to things like this that you\u2019re not going to come home, and you try your hardest to come home, and all together.\u201d Willey describes herself as a former army wife, having spent years moving with her family to wherever her husband was stationed. He left the army after serving in Afghanistan and they moved to the country to be closer to family. \u201cWe swapped uniforms. He got out of his and I jumped into this one,\u201d she says. Willey is quick to smile and cracks jokes. She bids farewell to a colleague with a trill: \u201cBye Benny!\u201d But the enormity of her work is clear. Willey reflects on what it\u2019s like when her fire pager goes off, and how she scrambles to organise her family and her dogs. \u201cHave I locked my front door?\u201d she sometimes wonders in the truck. The youngest of her two daughters hasn\u2019t always been thrilled about her mum fighting fires. \u201cI guess because daddy was always away in his uniform and she\u2019d always look at me in uniform and get a bit upset because I\u2019d have to go,\u201d Willey says. \u201cBut they\u2019re talking about it at school now, the fires are such a big topic. My daughter has changed her tune a little bit.\u201d She says it\u2019s worth it. \u201cWe had a lady turn up and she was thanking us for what we do \u2026 and she got teary and I got teary and that reminds you why you do what you do. \u201cThere\u2019s no ego in it, you\u2019re just helping.\u201d Every crew member uses the word \u201cfamily\u201d to describe their group. They all speak of camaraderie. Many say they found their sense of purpose through the RFS. They say they\u2019ve stuck together through deaths, heartbreak, and difficult scenes like fatal car accidents they cannot bring themselves to describe. They celebrate too, getting together for beers or a barbecue on weekends, and organising a village Christmas party featuring Santa on a 1930s-era fire truck. Steve Plummer, a mechanic, is one of the last to leave the station. He is a senior deputy captain, a rank he says he had no ambition for: \u201cI was happy to just turn up, get on a truck, put wet stuff on the red stuff and that would have been good, but it turns out I\u2019ve got a knack for it.\u201d Plummer grew up in Kurri Kurri, in the Hunter region, and spent his childhood exploring bushland with mates, making slingshots, and climbing in mine shafts. He always wanted to be a police officer, a dream that only intensified when he had his own minor run-in as a teenager. \u201cI used my slingshot to break a streetlight. I was 16 and [the police] scared the beejeebies out of me. \u201cI never got charged or anything, but they took me around the block a few times and took me to the station. \u201cThat was enough to scare me off doing anything like that. It could have gone the other way. I could have been on the other side of the ledger.\u201d Plummer says he was diverted from policing when he took up his trade. But he\u2019s now getting what he hoped for \u2013 a sense of service mixed with adventure \u2013 when he pulls on his yellow and navy RFS uniform. \u201cThese guys, you\u2019re on the frontline with them, and they understand how you feel and we all lean on each other. \u201cIf one\u2019s feeling down, the others will pick them up.\u201d As night falls the doors are pulled shut and the trucks sit ready to go for whatever the morning brings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
