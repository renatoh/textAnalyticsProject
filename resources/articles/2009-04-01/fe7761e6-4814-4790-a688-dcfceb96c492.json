Parked just behind him in the pit lane in Brazil was the McLaren of the new world champion. As Lewis Hamilton erupted from the cockpit in celebration, Button attempted to put out the fire: divergent actions and emotions that were symbolic of their respective seasons. Button would not have been blamed if he had left one of the most difficult cars he had ever driven to its miserable fate. After 18 races, all he had to show was three points and relentless effort expended going nowhere, the season having been even worse than 2007 when he finished 15th with six points. At 28, Button was reaching his peak in terms of speed and experience, but, just to exacerbate the frustration, here was a 23-year-old British champion receiving the acclaim that, 10 years before, had seemed certain to be going Button's way. At least it had been if you believed the hype surrounding an arrival even more unexpected than Hamilton's introduction at the beginning of 2007. Button appeared to come from nowhere. His record in the junior formulas was nothing like as glorious or extensive as Hamilton's carefully managed climb through the ranks. When Button was offered a test drive with Williams at the end of 1999, karting aside, he had done virtually nothing as he thought about stepping up after one year in Formula Three. That move had been made with success by Ayrton Senna and Martin Brundle, but the difference was that Senna had won the F3 title in 1983 with 12 victories; Brundle had been runner-up with nine wins. Button had won three races and finished third in the 1999 British championship. He was far from the finished article and Marc Hynes, the winner of the championship, was not even considered. \"You sometimes wonder how F1 people reach their decisions,\" said Hynes at the time, more in bewilderment than bitterness. Jackie Stewart was more direct in his assessment: \"Jenson's had a series of managers who have been too ambitious for him and demanded too much from a boy who's yet to really develop.\" The triple world champion was proved correct when Button crashed during qualifying for his first race in Melbourne, the circuit where, two weeks ago, he did not put a wheel wrong en route to the first of two successive wins. In between Button has taken part in 151 grands prix, winning one of them, while driving for Williams, Benetton-Renault and British American Racing, which became Honda in 2006. The pressure had been on from the start. Williams were beginning an important relationship with BMW and the precious Ralf Schumacher was Button's team-mate. Williams were keen to employ Juan Pablo Montoya in 2001 and had no hesitation in loaning Button to Renault for two years, a typically pragmatic move that said little for Button's prospects and ignored an important hint of his latent natural ability as he qualified strongly at Spa and Suzuka, two very difficult circuits that favour the driver as much as his car. A reputation, scarcely advanced by an equally mediocre Renault, was rescued when David Richards, the boss of BAR, signed the Englishman in 2004 to begin a liaison that would have a mix of lows \u2013 an accident at Monaco and a charge of cheating that had nothing to do with Button \u2013 and the occasional very impressive high, such as a maiden victory in a wet-dry race in Hungary in 2006. His mature performance that day indicated not only that he was ready for consistent success, but highlighted how unprepared he had been in 2000. \"In the first three years in F1, I had pretty bad experiences,\" Button says. \"I wasn't ready, as I had come through Formula Ford and F3 so quick. I came into F1 at a very young age and also not understanding a racing car so well. A lot of other drivers had come through the ranks and did not have that situation. I wasn't ready until 2004. That's when I felt able to fight for a world championship. It has been up and down since then, but you do get better with age as you get more and more experience.\" to be of the most painful kind, particularly in 2007 when Honda seemed set to provide Button with the vehicle he needed. It would be a disaster on several counts, not least the car being hopelessly uncompetitive in terms of lap times and also looking a complete joke, even when standing still. On the advice of Simon Fuller and his 19 Entertainment agency, Honda went for the so-called \"Earth Dreams\" car, a concept aimed at riding an environmentally friendly bandwagon that had its wheels fall off from the outset. Button probably wished the same would happen to his car to save the embarrassment of a perpetual struggle at the back of the field. Fuller vanished as quickly as he came, to leave Button facing the prospect of a reputation being crushed by the rise and rise of Hamilton at the opposite end of the field. There was to be no respite at the beginning of last year. John Button, a former rallycross champion who understood his son's frustration, received a desperate call on the evening after Jenson had tested the 2008 Honda for the first time. \"I could tell by his voice almost straight away that it wasn't good news,\" John would recall. \"He said: 'Dad, it ain't happening. The car's no good.' I didn't know what to say. A driver knows instinctively from the first few laps whether or not a car is basically OK. It can be difficult to drive, but you feel that, with a bit of work, it has the basics you need. Or it can feel completely wrong and you know that's the way it's going to be, no matter what you do. I could tell that's what Jense felt. My heart went out to the boy. Another wasted season lay ahead. It was a desperate, desperate feeling.\" Intentionally or otherwise, that feeling was transmitted to the media at the launch of the car at the team's headquarters in Northamptonshire. Instead of talking about 2008, they spoke with enthusiasm about being prepared for the far-reaching changes to the technical regulations in 2009. There was hope because these words were being spoken by Ross Brawn, the highly respected technical director lured back to F1 after a sabbatical following a decade of outstanding success with Ferrari. Since the 2008 Honda was not his responsibility, Brawn had no need of the expectant hype that accompanies the unveiling of months of labour and hope. But he would need to produce a decent car for 2009. Those hopes were dashed without warning on 5 December 2008 when Honda, faced with plummeting sales and a worldwide recession, pulled the plug on their F1 team without further ado. More than 700 people faced redundancy, among them the highest paid employee. \"I had just landed from a week's training in Lanzarote and I was thinking: 'Shit, I'm fit,'\" Button has said. \"And then I got the call from Richard [Goddard], my manager. The phone just dropped out of my hand. Everyone was staring at me thinking: 'What's the matter with him? He's just got off a Ryanair flight.' \"It made me train harder, in a way. I couldn't do anything about the decision. I just had to train as I would coming into a new season, thinking I was racing. For sure, I wasn't as smiley as I usually would be over a winter. The family noticed that over Christmas. And it wasn't like I knew [about the various takeover attempts] before the rest of the world did. I was up one day, down the next. It was very tough mentally. \"I would have been a horrible person to live with over the winter. Luckily enough, I started dating Jessica [Michibata, a Japanese lingerie model], so she looked after me. My family were very supportive. I think my old man found it more difficult than I did. He was very depressed. I spent a few weeks with Jessica in Hawaii, which was great, just to get away from it all. \"The problem is, I think people get a little embarrassed to call up in certain situations. But some people did call, which was a surprise. And some of it was from other teams. It wasn't 'Would you like to drive for us in the future?', it was 'Hope you're all right. It's obviously a difficult situation.' So that was nice to hear. It was good to know that people cared. \"My friends were very supportive. I spent a few days back in Somerset, just seeing how it was going to be not racing. The problem was I would go out for dinner or out for drinks with friends and I would always get people coming up, saying: 'Joining the queue, then? I didn't know there was a VIP one.' I was, like: 'Oh, that's really funny. I've heard it I don't know how many times, but it's still really funny...'\" Despite the terrible uncertainty hanging over them, the workforce at Brackley continued building the car while the management pursued the alternative of a buy-out. Brawn was instrumental in persuading Honda to hand over fixed assets that included land, buildings, factory equipment and machinery worth $110m (\u00a375m), as well the $50m the motor manufacturer would otherwise have spent on redundancy costs. A deal was done with Mercedes-Benz for the supply of engines, necessitating a difficult, but not impossible, last-minute conversion on the car. With just one test session in Barcelona remaining before the start of the season, the 2009 Brawn-Mercedes appeared for the first time on 9 March. No one gave it much hope. When Button was fastest that day, just under three weeks before the first race in Australia, F1 insiders felt sure the car was running below the weight limit in order to record an encouraging time and attract desperately needed sponsorship. But Button knew better. His past experiences in bad cars qualified him to appreciate a good one. He could barely contain his excitement when telling his father. It is one thing making a competitive car; quite another having a driver capable of making the most of it. Button knew that moment had come. His natural, flowing style at the wheel, reminiscent of Stewart and Alain Prost, was perfectly suited to Brawn's handiwork. \"I had a big smile on my face when I heard about the team being saved,\" says Button. \"I found out the same time as the team did. There was no preferential treatment. Then to find that the car was quick: that was the final piece of the jigsaw. \"It feels good that people think I am a contender for the championship. It has always been there, but I never had anywhere near the equipment that I deserved. I have been ready to deliver for many years. You do get better with age. I am 29 years old, but I am still young. I feel as excited as I did when I drove that Williams for the first time. The difference is, I now have the experience of nine years in F1. I'm ready.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
