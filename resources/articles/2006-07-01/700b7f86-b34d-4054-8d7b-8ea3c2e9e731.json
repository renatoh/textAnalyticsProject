Yet it is in danger of becoming the warehouse of the world. Plaguing Britain's cities and suburbs is a mushrooming acreage of mega-sheds and depot centres undermining civic life and our manufacturing base. And, as things stand, government policy is only conniving in their proliferation. David Lammy, the culture minister, criticised supermarkets and DIY stores that resemble \"enormous versions of the Tetra Paks they sell inside\". Rightly, he highlighted their hideous impact on the built environment thanks to security lighting, oceanic car parks and corrugated-iron exteriors. Yet over the past 10 years these supermarkets, and the depots that supply them, have been allowed to occupy every ring road and retail park. Nowhere is immune. In rural Hampshire, plans are currently afoot for a Tesco mega-shed larger than the Millennium Dome, measuring 1.25m sq ft. Changes to transport regulations mean that some 1,400 HGVs will be allowed to trundle through rural lanes day and night. Behind many of these developments are powerful changes in the global economy. The growth of internet shopping has driven the demand for delivery packaging depots. More broadly, it is argued, the liberalisation of world trade and the influx of manufactured goods from India and China mean that Britain has no option but to erect ever larger warehouses. To some government advisers, such a trend is only to be welcomed. As John Vidal recently revealed in this newspaper, consultants for the West Midlands regional assembly are urging the decimation of what little greenfield remains in that area. \"Very large warehouses of up to 100,000 square metres can be expected to be demanded [in Britain] in the very near future,\" concluded a recent report. \"The bigger the better.\" With them would come the inevitable neon glare, fencing and visual pollution that Lammy abhors. Such a defeatist spatial policy risks turning Britain into little more than a landing strip and aircraft hangar for the world's competing manufacturers. The nation that gave birth to the industrial revolution - to the idea of innovation, development and mass production - is now all but throwing in the towel. Packaging and ferrying, rather than designing and making, are what policy makers are urging us to settle for. Rather than investing in manufacturing, planners seem happy to back a high-carbon economy of depots and deliveries. Needless to say, the jobs that come with the warehouses are low-wage and low-skill. The West Midlands study suggests the siting of new mega-sheds next to urban areas with above average levels of unemployment to keep wages down. This mass warehousing of the British economy is also strangling attempts at urban regeneration. For these depots and big-box retail parks are the footholds of urban sprawl, eating into green-belt land and steadily undercutting the viability of downtown commerce. How much easier to settle for the Tesco, Pizza Hut and PC World on the bypass than the hard graft of civic renewal. But one only need visit the likes of Cheltenham, Rugby or Daventry to see how out-of-town megaplexes can castrate once vibrant city centres. Rather than simply giving in to global market forces - and sacrificing our towns and countryside in the process - we should be seeking new ways to rejuvenate Britain's urban manufacturing base. Ministers should act now to honour Disraeli's dictum: halt the warehouses, revive the workshops - and end the depot sprawl disfiguring Britain. \u00b7 Tristram Hunt is the author of Building Jerusalem: the Rise and Fall of the Victorian City tristramhunt@btopenworld.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
