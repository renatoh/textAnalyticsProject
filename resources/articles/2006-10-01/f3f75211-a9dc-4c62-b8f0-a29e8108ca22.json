Within this, the development of basic literacy, language and numeracy skills is a key priority. No government has ever invested so much in basic skills development, benefiting individuals, businesses and communities. We have committed substantial investment to support adult basic skills learners, including 1.9 million Esol (English for speakers of other languages) learners. We know we need more people with better skills, and we need them more urgently than ever before. We expect Lord Leitch to report on his findings on the UK skills challenge later this autumn. But his interim report has already signalled the stretch and ambition that will be required if we are to deliver the level of skills the economy demands. It is right that we are also focusing on developing basic skills to improve social mobility and cohesion, with Esol provision obviously playing a particularly important part. Many learners have recognised that improving their English language skills opens up opportunities, and want to enrol on courses. Since 2001, demand for Esol courses has tripled. Our levels of investment have responded, but as the National Institute for Adult Continuing Education (Niace) report on Esol provision, published last week, made clear, the funding situation is not sustainable and isn't best serving learners in our priority groups, some of whom have to wait too long to get a place on a course. We need to start looking at who should pay for this learning, and what contribution individuals and employers ought to make. That is why, building on commitments that we set out last year, we have asked the Learning and Skills Council to look at the appropriateness of current funding arrangements for Esol provision and how we might refocus support on priority groups. I will be making an announcement later this month, when we launch Priorities for Success 2 - the LSC's key annual planning document - about our response to this review. We have also responded to the challenges of the new landscape by working with our partners, especially Lifelong Learning UK, the sector skills council responsible for the professional development of the FE workforce, and the new Quality Improvement Agency, to improve the teaching and learning infrastructure. We have invested heavily in a more professionalised teaching workforce and in improving the quality of learning. As the Niace report acknowledges, there is more work to do, but we are committed to achieving a fully qualified Skills for Life workforce by 2010, and ensuring that every learner has a good learning experience. We are working to ensure a greater choice for individuals and employers in the Esol qualifications we offer. That choice will ensure people can make decisions about which qualifications best suit their needs. We need to do more to overcome the particular barriers to achievement and progression faced by certain groups of Esol learners if they are to move into employment, fully integrate into UK society, and support their families. This includes helping parents to support their children in school and in the community, working with the LSC on its new responsibilities for offenders and benefit recipients, and continuing to work with the Union Learning Fund to broker understanding among employers. We have made excellent progress, but the new landscape presents new challenges: to enable Esol learners to take their proper place in our society, to help employers recruit and retain people with the skills they need and, right across the government, to support and strengthen our economy and society. We are committed to meeting these challenges. \u00b7 Bill Rammell is minister for further education and lifelong learning"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
