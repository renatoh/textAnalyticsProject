Fuss wouldn\u2019t be entirely unwarranted. McKenzie\u2019s portrayal of a particular type of socially awkward, deadpan New Zealander helped put the country\u2019s dry humour on the map. And the comedy duo Flight of the Conchords \u2013 in which he performs with Jemaine Clement \u2013 so enraptured Hollywood that he could still be there if he wanted to, churning out season after season of the acclaimed TV show of the same name. Their comedy was deeply strange, and audiences couldn\u2019t get enough. Ten years on the pair can still fill an arena \u2013 as McKenzie puts it \u2013 with \u201cjust two little guitars and a xylophone\u201d. Yet McKenzie is happier away from Los Angeles and out of the spotlight. He is inconspicuous \u2013 his ideal state \u2013 in a cafe in New Zealand\u2019s capital, raincoat on thanks to a torrential summer downpour. He prefers the quiet bustle of home to the bright lights of Hollywood. Next year he is bringing his surreal sensibilities to a local crowd, again from behind the scenes, as a guest curator of the biennial New Zealand festival. \u2018It was so weird\u2019 A strange taste of celebrity at the beginning of his career \u201cput me off being famous early on\u201d, McKenzie says. A few years before Flight of the Conchords blew up in the northern hemisphere, he landed a small role \u2013 three seconds, to be precise \u2013 as an unnamed elf extra in Peter Jackson\u2019s first Lord of the Rings film. He\u2019s still not sure how but his silent turn was spotted by Tolkien fanatics, who called him Figwit (an acronym for \u201cFrodo is great \u2026 who is that??!\u201d), gave him a website, some slightly disturbing fan art and an unexpected moment of global fame. A story about the Figwit phenomenon appeared on the cover of USA Today. At the height of Figwit-mania, McKenzie was invited to an event run by the Scottish Tolkien Society. His university friend Taika Waititi \u2013 now a film-maker of Jojo Rabbit and Thor: Ragnarok fame \u2013 went too, as a sort of bodyguard. \u201cHe got really into it, dressed up as Gandalf,\u201d says McKenzie, who did not wear a costume. When he and Clement travelled to the Edinburgh fringe festival to perform as Flight of the Conchords, they found that those Tolkien fans had flown in from around the world to attend the shows. The fans were \u201clovely\u201d and tickets sales to Lord of the Rings enthusiasts paid their rent in Edinburgh. But, McKenzie says: \u201cIt was so weird.\u201d Such was his popularity that he was upgraded (slightly) in two later films in the Tolkein franchise. But the flashpoint of fame had taken its toll. When he and Clement found the spotlight with Flight of the Conchords, he says: \u201cI was quite held back in connecting with fans, I think, as a result of that.\u201d He now travels to the US only for meetings, returning to his wife and three children in Wellington. Ballet, bowling and Boris Johnson McKenzie grew up in the capital, the son of Deirdre Tarrant, a decorated New Zealand ballet teacher and dance company founder. By the time he hit high school he was taking ballet classes four days a week. The physical acumen learned from dance meant he also excelled at cricket. But he felt compelled to add his own flair. \u201cI would practice ballet in the outfield while I was waiting for fielding,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then when I\u2019d run in to bowl, I was a fast bowler but sometimes I would do sort of a pirouette on my run to distract the batter.\u201d At 14 he gave up ballet for music, channelling his obsessive energies into \u201chours and hours\u201d of practising drums. In Wellington, a small city in a country of fewer than 5 million people, where work for artists is hard to come by, McKenzie learned from his mother\u2019s success. \u201cShe was all about doing a lot of different things to turn it into an income,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned that pretty early on \u2013 how to compromise to pay the bills.\u201d Since his career took off he has also learnt the importance of doing things his own way. \u201cI spent quite a few years trying to do things the Hollywood way,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m learning that, actually, it\u2019s fine to not do it that way.\u201d That sometimes includes walking away \u2013 which he and Clement did from the Conchords after two seasons of the Emmy-winning HBO show and talk of a third in the offing. But it also sometimes means skewering expectations. Pitch meetings, for example, often involve delivering dry proposals to executives; no singing, for example, and \u201cno dragons\u201d, says McKenzie \u2013 who is very keen on dragons. Doing things the McKenzie way means bringing a slice of Wellington\u2019s experimental theatre scene \u2013 he describes shows he worked on in the 1990s as \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201cbonkers\u201d \u2013 to Hollywood studio lots in the hope of winning over staid suits. Last year he produced a lo-fi, immersive theatre installation on a Warner Bros soundstage in an attempt to get the green light for a film project \u2013 a fairytale musical, set in New York and drawing on his perennial influences of Labyrinth, The Muppets and The Princess Bride. A friend of McKenzie\u2019s, playing the moon, spoke to the audience \u201cwith her head through this moon thing\u201d; McKenzie was part of a three-piece band dubbed the Sleepless Knights, wearing rented suits of armour. \u201cThey loved it! They were like, \u2018What the hell\u2019s going on here?\u2019 They were into it,\u201d says McKenzie. The project was approved. For the New Zealand festival, McKenzie is planning a week-long programme featuring local music, an outdoor adventure for families and performances by the Netherlands clowning group Sl\u00e4pstick, which he says is \u201cjust a really good time\u201d. He\u2019s also writing songs for a new musical to be performed at the festival, The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil, based on a novella by the US author George Saunders in collaboration with London\u2019s National Theatre. Saunders\u2019 work, like McKenzie\u2019s, is surreal and blackly funny, and McKenzie says the Orwellian parable conjures up shades of \u201cBoris Johnson and Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cThe character of Phil becomes president, and he\u2019s this idiot and his brain keeps falling off,\u201d he says. McKenzie has half of the show\u2019s tunes left to compose and a matter of weeks in which to finish them, but writing funny songs, he says, still feeds him spiritually. \u201cThere\u2019s something about it that\u2019s addictive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of enlightening and it makes me feel connected to the universe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
