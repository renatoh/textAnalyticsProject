San Francisco police department (SFPD) policy allows officers to use lethal force if they have \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that they or other people are in \u201cimminent danger of death or serious bodily injury\u201d. Suhr\u2019s statement at a \u201ctown hall\u201d meeting is the latest attempt by the embattled police chief to explain how Luis Gongora, a 45-year-old man who lived in a tent on the street where he was killed, ended up fatally wounded within 30 seconds of three police officers arriving at the encampment. The new information on the shooting did not appease the crowd, which broke out into chants of \u201cFire chief Suhr\u201d. The shooting has prompted outrage and heartbreak among friends and neighbors of Gongora \u2013 who describe him as harmless and non-violent \u2013 and among San Franciscans who see the shooting as just the latest assault on the homeless and poor by a city that is increasingly unaffordable to all but the wealthy. More than 10,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the officers to be prosecuted for Gongora\u2019s killing. Suhr said that the incident began when two homeless outreach workers responded to a complaint that a baby was crying in the homeless encampment. The workers did not find a baby, but they observed Gongora \u201cforcefully kicking a basketball off parked cars\u201d, Suhr said. Neighbors and friends say that Gongora spent much of his days kicking a soccer ball on the street, usually against a wall. As they were preparing to leave, Suhr said, the workers again saw Gongora carrying a knife that he was \u201cswinging indiscriminately as he walked down the street\u201d. The workers said that he appeared to be in an \u201caltered mental state\u201d. At that point, the outreach workers decided to call the police. The workers are employed by the city\u2019s department of public health, which is not releasing their names. One of the workers told police that this was only the fifth time she has called the police in 10 years, Suhr said. The department of emergency management has declined to release the audio of the 911 call, citing the ongoing investigation. Suhr said that when police officers arrived minutes later, they saw Gongora \u201cseated on the sidewalk with a large knife and the blade pointed up\u201d. After giving verbal orders in English and Spanish, Suhr said that Gongora \u201cbriefly put the knife down then quickly picked it up\u201d. The officers then deployed four beanbag rounds. \u201cAt that time, he stood up and ran at one of the officers with the knife in his hand,\u201d Suhr said. The officers fired seven 40 caliber rounds. Suhr said preliminary medical report says that Gongora was struck six times. Asked why police officers would deploy beanbag rounds at a man who was sitting down, Surh replied: \u201cThey tried to shoot him in the arm to get him to drop the knife.\u201d One of the officers who fired was a sergeant who has worked for SFPD for 17 years \u2013 the second has 13 years\u2019 experience in law enforcement, four with SFPD. Both were white. A third officer, a Spanish speaker, arrived at the scene after the first two and did not open fire. In interviews with the Guardian, six witnesses to the shooting have challenged Suhr\u2019s claim that Gongora \u201ccharged\u201d at the officers. They include three homeless residents of the same encampment who were standing on the same side of the street as Gongora, two neighbors who saw the incident from their apartment windows across the street, and one woman who was walking on the sidewalk across the street. On the Friday after the shooting, police commander Greg McEachern released excerpts of statements from four witnesses. Of those, three agreed that Gongora had moved toward the police officers before the shooting, the police chief said. At the meeting, Suhr presented excerpts from the statements of 12 eyewitnesses, including the two homeless outreach workers and 10 others. The selective release of information drew the ire of city supervisor David Campos, who attended the town hall. \u201cYou have an ongoing investigation supposedly to find out what happened in this incident, and yet you\u2019ve had a number of press conferences where you are already prejudging what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask the police commission and the mayor to direct the police department to stop trying the case in the public.\u201d Details emerge about Gongora\u2019s life Among the speakers at the town hall meeting was Matthew Castro, 40, who broke down in tears as he recalled Gongora. Castro said that he met Gongora at work in 2003, when Gongora was a prep cook at Mel\u2019s Drive-In, a diner in San Francisco. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a hostile bone in his body,\u201d Castro said. \u201cHe was 130lb. He was so docile. We was my best friend for about a decade.\u201d According to Castro, Gongora has a wife and three children living in Teabo, Mexico, his hometown, and two brothers and a cousin living in San Francisco. Castro said Gongora, who he did not believe had any history of mental illness, was evicted from his apartment in 2012 and ended up on the streets. \u201cI was trying to convince him to go back to Mexico,\u201d he added. \u201cI would love to see justice, but that just doesn\u2019t seem to happen in this country for brown and black people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
