But I reckon that over five days at Royal Ascot, the corporation does enough forelock-tugging, reality-ignoring and arse-licking of the establishment (I realise that forelock-tugging and doing the other thing may be physically difficult, but by God they give it a try) to allow them at least half a dozen Panoramas mildly critical of the status quo. Take the royal procession. Her Majesty the Queen and her chums \u2013 the Earl of Romney, Mr and Mrs Anthony Duckworth-Chad, that lot \u2013 arrive each day in their horse-drawn carriages and the BBC dutifully provides commentary, mostly about how wonderful the Queen and Prince Philip look for their age, how heartwarming it is that, despite the showers, they insist on sitting in an open coach to allow the hoi polloi to get a decent butchers, and how marvellous it is that they all love racehorses. Peter Hunt, the BBC's royal correspondent, assisted Clare Balding in the sycophancy on Ladies' Day, noting that Princess Beatrice was coming to the end of her \"career\" as a student. \"It will be interesting to see what she does next,\" said Peter. \"Whether she becomes a full-time royal, or whether she's encouraged to do other things.\" Call me old-fashioned, but does she not remain a full-time royal whatever she does? Is that not less a career choice and more of an accident of birth, a divine right deriving directly from the will of God? If I were Beatrice, I should go for the full-time option, get some new hats, take waving lessons and put my name down for a couple of factory visits in Stoke-on-Trent, if there are any left. But I suspect the old firm will find her something else. PR is my guess. BBC royal correspondents obviously have to collude in the pretence that the royal family are more or less like us; choosing careers and so on. I have no idea how you get to be royal correspondent, but I suspect that after you've done proper journalism for a while, some editor asks you: \"Do you fancy the royal gig? It means talking bollocks at Ascot and royal weddings, but it gets the Daily Mail off our back, and you get a couple of decent trips.\" I am, however, grateful to Peter for the information that Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, developed an interest in horse racing while watching sport on television with her grandmother. Wow. The Middletons actually own a horse, Clare added, saying it was \"very exciting that Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed their day at the Derby\". The key point in all this for Peter was that the Middletons would have something to talk about over lunch at Her Maj's gaff. \"It's helpful for them that they do have an interest, given that it's a subject they could talk about when they met the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh over lunch this afternoon,\" revealed the people's royal correspondent, \"as they did a few weeks before the wedding, when they had a similar lunch, when again the topic could have been this, and other things they share, and of course they are both living in this county, Berkshire.\" Oh come on, Peter. When you look at the cast list for the Ladies' Day lunch, there are so many other topics that could be raised over the After Eights. Take this Duckworth-Chad bird, landowner and City of London businessman, but also past prime warden of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. Until we start emulating the French and eating as well as racing horses, I should say fish are far more interesting, so D-C might well have been quizzed on the worldwide shortage of langoustine tails, prompting a scampi-in-the-basket famine and a possible lack of venues for Robbie Williams tribute acts \u2013 one of Britain's few growth industries. Also, D-C \u2013 as I am sure he will not mind me calling him \u2013 is the grandson of Sir George Duckworth, a half-brother of the painter Vanessa Bell and writer Virginia Woolf, who charged George with molesting her. There is one to throw in during a lull in the conversation. And what about the actor Anthony Andrews, who was among those donning the nosebag? I am sure there would have been laughs aplenty at the lunch, had someone mentioned his hilarious 1975 soft-porn movie Las adolescentes, in which Koo Stark \u2013 see, a royal link right there, Peter \u2013 played a naive Spanish girl preyed upon by Andrews, who took semi-naked snaps of her for a jazz mag. And now you know why, in 25 years of freelancing on and off for the BBC, I have never had a whiff of the royal gig."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
