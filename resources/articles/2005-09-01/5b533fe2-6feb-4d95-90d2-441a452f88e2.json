Having soaked up a lot of pressure in the first half, Wigan struck soon after the restart, might have increased their advantage and despite more Everton pressure late in the second half, the visitors held on to make it 10 points from 12. In a bid to halt Everton's goal drought, Moyes dropped Marcus Bent to the bench, kept Duncan Ferguson there with him, and opted to play James McFadden, with just one goal to his name in 50 Premiership appearances, as the sole striker. Paul Jewell, the Wigan manager, replaced goalkeeper Mike Pollitt with the experienced John Filan, fit again after a double hernia operation, while there was also a start for Henri Camera, who came off the bench to score in the draw with Middlesbrough. Both sides went close early on from corners. Kevin Kilbane's glancing header from Tim Cahill's delivery clipped the top of the crossbar before Pascal Chimbonda thundered Jimmy Bullard's corner goal-wards, but Nuno Valente cleared off the line. Chimbonda's last-ditch interception when Leon Osman broke into the box triggered a loud penalty appeal from the Everton fans but play was waved on and Chimbonda was again on hand to clear after a scramble. Simon Davies then chipped just over from twenty yards as Everton began to dominate. Osman won a free-kick when he tried to squeeze past Arjan De Zeeuw and Leighton Baines on the edge of the box, but Mikel Arteta wasted the chance. Davies then missed a great opportunity, firing wide from fifteen yards just before the break, having been set up by McFadden's superb reverse pass. Camara went close from long range, but Wigan's best other chance of a lively first half came when Chimbonda made space on the right and crossed dangerously, only Philip Neville's interception at the far post preventing Lee McCulloch from sliding the ball home with Nigel Martyn beaten. The visitors made a mockery of all Everton's first half possession just over a minute after the restart. McCulloch dispossessed Neville down Wigan's left, fed Camara, whose instant cross only found its way to the opposite wing but Chimbonda was first to react and cross for Jason Roberts. He threaded the ball to Camara inside the six yard box, who shot on the turn. Martyn made a good parry but Damien Francis poked it in from close range. The goal stunned both Everton and Goodison Park as the visitors took charge and belied their lack of experience at this level. Roberts could have doubled the advantage but failed to connect with Francis' cross, then a Camara cross on the break again just eluded him. Everton responded by bringing on Bent and Ferguson and playing with three strikers. Bent could have scored but just failed to reach McFadden's low cross at the far post as Everton started regaining the initiative. Everton's aerial onslaught predictably followed and Bent had a goal disallowed after 78 minutes after Cahill was judged to have pushed Chimbonda in the back to reach Arteta's cross. Then Filan pulled off a remarkable point blank save to deny Bent's flick from McFadden's cross. Filan was also on hand to tip over another cross by McFadden as Everton struggled to create any other clear-cut openings. The final whistle blew at a discontented Goodison, apart from the sizeable visiting support. Everton's home record this season in all competitions reads played four, lost four, scored one.They have a chance to make amends on Thursday against Dinamo Bucharest in the Uefa Cup - but already trail 5-1 from the first leg. Man of the match: Pascal Chimbonda - outstanding at both ends of the pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
