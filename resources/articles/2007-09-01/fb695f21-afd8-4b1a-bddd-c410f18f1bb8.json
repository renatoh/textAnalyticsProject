Short on vision, but long on politics", "bodyText": "This was meant to be Brown unbound. For the first time in 13 years, he would not have to look over his shoulder, watching himself lest he overshot his authority. For the first time he could come to the Labour party conference and address it as its leader, utterly in command, no longer the sulking, sullen rival of Tony Blair. Surely this liberated Brown would, at long last, unleash the fiery passion, the oratory learned at the feet of the old Clydesiders, that he had seemed to bottle up for so long. Or if not that, then surely he would unveil the grand vision, the philosophical masterplan that had been hatched and polished over the long years of internal opposition to Tony Blair. At last Brown could reveal himself. Yet the prime minister's speech yesterday did not quite do that. There was an arresting, even moving, passage about the teenage battle to save his sight after a rugby accident. That came after a series of canny moves, adroitly positioning himself and outmanoeuvring his rivals. But there were few rhetorical flights to stir the passions, nor a clear, over-arching narrative of how Brown plans to use the power he has craved so long. This was instead a solid, capable speech that was long on politics, but short on inspiration and vision. That lack of a single, coherent argument - or indeed a stand-out, memorable phrase - should not detract from the political skill on display. Brown continued the work in which he has been engaged since taking office: establishing himself as something akin to a leader of national unity, one above the fray of ordinary politics - one to whom traditional Tory voters can turn. To that end, he spoke of Britain and the resilience of the British people - even \"this island story\" - so often, he could have been a war leader, summoning up the blitz spirit of yore. He took a leaf out of the US presidential book, praising John Smeaton, the baggage handler who helped thwart the terror attack on Glasgow airport, seated yesterday next to Sarah Brown - just as the firefighters of 9/11 used to take their ovations next to the first lady. You expected Brown to declare: \"The state of our union is strong.\" But that was a rare moment of theatrics. Otherwise, he eschewed the old Blair tricks, including the traditional warm-up routine of gags bashing the Tories and the Lib Dems. He did not even mention either party by name. That might have been an attempt to cast them as unworthy of his attention or, more subtly, to avoid offending their supporters whose votes he wants. Instead, Brown confined himself to a strategy of crush and steal: he either trod on David Cameron's key policy lines or grabbed them for himself. In the first category came his deft rebuttal of the Tory insistence that Britain is now a \"broken society\". Describing the public's fortitude in the face of the terror attacks, floods and foot-and-mouth, he turned patriotism itself against the Conservatives: \"Don't let anyone tell us, the British people, that this country of ours ... has ever been broken by anyone or anything.\" No less skilful was his crushing of the Tory proposal to give tax breaks to married couples. What about children of one-parent families, of foster parents, of widows? Should they be second-class citizens? Brown went further, the son of the manse recalling that Jesus never wanted \"just some of the children\" to come unto him. Quoting scripture is a familiar tactic in American politics but this biblical reference, the second in the speech, seemed to leave the Labour audience in the hall uneasy. Mainly, though, Brown methodically stole what would once have been traditional Conservative lines - each designed to impress Mail and Telegraph readers. He praised the countryside as Britain's \"oxygen\"; he repeated his demand that immigrants learn English; he warned shops that sell booze to the underage they would lose their licences; and he promised to bring back matron. Where Cameron has struck a chord, Brown sought to strike it louder and faster. Work-life balance? He had it covered, with nine (and eventually 12) months' paid maternity leave. Kids exposed to internet porn? TV's Tanya Byron would look into it. Hug a hoodie? Brown knew that \"respect must be a two-way street\" and promised youth centres and a volunteering scheme. But his most adroit undermining of Cameron came when he spoke of the experience that had made him revere the NHS. By describing the incident that nearly blinded him, he established a clear difference between himself and his opponent (and, as it happens, his predecessor). \"These experiences taught me what families all across Britain know,\" he said - \"that things don't always come easy.\" Translation: Cameron (and Blair) may have led charmed lives, but I have not - and that's why I understand and care about you. This was the real connective tissue of the speech. There was no larger intellectual thread tying it all together, no driving argument to bind what was instead a laundry list of points on housing, crime, foreign affairs, the environment and the rest. The closest Brown came to a philosophy was his desire to \"unlock all Britain's talent\", which meant maintaining the war on child poverty and, of course, an increased commitment to improve education. One unreconciled Blairite listening to it all shook his head in despair, branding the speech as \"dire\". Everyone wants a personalised NHS, he bellowed. \"How's he going to do it? \"This central question - how?\" - remained unanswered. It may not matter. For the moment, especially if an election is looming, Brown's prime task is to confirm his political dominance and yesterday's speech did that. But after the politics comes the governing - and then he will have to offer something larger than the parable of his own life story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
