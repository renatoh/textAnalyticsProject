Reading Irenosen Okojie\u2019s stories is more like taking an old\u2011fashioned megadose: familiar reality peels away to reveal a world of bizarre transformations, stutters in time, encounters between gods and humans, and the fragmentation, or even the dissolution, of the self. Okojie\u2019s first novel, Butterfly Fish, begins with an empty bottle of palm wine rolling down a London street, presumably a nod to the 1952 novel by the Nigerian writer Amos Tutuola, The Palm-Wine Drinkard, in which an alcoholic young man makes a journey into the afterlife. That novel, which lies splayed open on a table in one story in Nudibranch, and which blends everyday life in Nigeria with the fantastical and phantasmagorical, is a spiritual ancestor to Okojie\u2019s work. Her fiction includes mundane elements \u2013 an Ikea sofa, a tower block, an Asda chiller cabinet \u2013 but can, at any moment, be overrun by the surreal or supernatural: the tower block is haunted, the chiller cabinet contains the severed head of a time-travelling monk, and atop the Ikea sofa crouches an animal with \u201ca green head, blank human eyes and a crocodile\u2019s tail\u201d, the embodiment of a woman\u2019s loneliness. You need to pay attention when you embark on one of Okojie\u2019s stories, because things can get very strange very quickly. \u201cFilamo\u201d, one of the wildest and best in the collection, begins: \u201cThe last monk told the tongue that holding a naked sheep\u2019s head underwater would undo it all.\u201d The suggestion is of some sort of ritual, which abound in Okojie\u2019s work, but a summary of the story\u2019s events \u2013 monks exploit wormholes to travel through time collecting artefacts from various ages, while saints Peter, Augustine and Christopher are deployed to keep an eye on them like some kind of ecclesiastical internal affairs unit \u2013 doesn\u2019t convey its powerful and singular effect. This resides less in what actually happens (it took me two readings to begin to work that out) and more in its evocation of the fundamental weirdness of Christian symbolism: St Peter was missing an ear, yet had a small translucent dragon\u2019s wing growing against a rib. St Augustine had lost a finger on his left hand but had two hearts, one pumping blood, the other mercury, so much so his tongue became silvery at particular angles. St Christopher had lost an eye and gained a filmy yellow fish iris, which cried seawater no matter his mood. The other highlights are \u201cMangata\u201d, which describes an albino architect\u2019s return from London to his hometown in Mozambique to build a series of water fountains, its tense atmosphere building towards a horrific climax, and \u201cDune Dunelm\u201d, about a rootless chef called Canelo. Here Okojie transforms Rapa Nui (the Polynesian name for Easter Island) into a space somewhere between geographical reality and a manifestation of the psyche, as resonant objects from Canelo\u2019s life \u2013 \u201chis brain scans \u2026 the red paintbrush he\u2019d used to paint the walls of his first apartment \u2026 a photograph of his mother\u201d \u2013 begin washing up on the shore. The territory Okojie occupies here abuts that of JG Ballard\u2019s The Terminal Beach, another story in which a man reckons with his past on a deserted Pacific island. One of the pleasures of her stories is their unpredictability: it\u2019s often difficult to say where a sentence will end up, let alone a paragraph or an entire scene. Sometimes, however, the writing is more obscure than I think it intends to be. Image-making is Okojie\u2019s great strength, but its potency can get lost in tangled sentences, or similes that confuse rather than make the thing they are describing more vivid. In \u201cZinzi from Boketto\u201d, for example, she writes that the misshapenness of a circus performer\u2019s hunchback is accentuated for the troupe\u2019s shows, but what does it add to say that this larger hump looks \u201cas if one-eyed creatures grew inside, reaching for their lost sight\u201d? Near the start of the same story \u201cZinzi from Boketto\u201d, for example, we encounter the following sentence, one of several in the book I find impossible to understand: Rising up as though ready to break from the carriage of squealing oddities to scour the rooftops for iridescent particles of past nights the woman had left behind, while the carriage was sucked into the vortex, Halmin reduced to a mouth in his top hat and the woman using the reins to drag people from the carriage into sudden embraces. In other stories we find \u201ccavernous caves\u201d, \u201cgeneric, non-specific advice\u201d; \u201ca small smattering\u201d. The occasional tautology is hardly unforgivable, but these are emblematic of an unfinished quality that mars parts of this collection. Okojie displays a poet\u2019s verve for creating unusual combinations of words, but sometimes they, and these stories, are some distance away from their final and most effective iterations. That is frustrating, because, like the nudibranch molluscs of the title story, her work is also notable for its \u201cextraordinary colours and striking forms\u201d. \u2022 Nudibranch is published by Dialogue (RRP \u00a314.99).
