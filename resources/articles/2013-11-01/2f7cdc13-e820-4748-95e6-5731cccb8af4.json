The 7.5 million people who are in danger of being run over in Britain should try crossing a street in Cambodia, where the little green man starts running faster and faster as the clock counts down. Rather than inducing a coronary, we think the little green man should take an altogether more relaxed approach. The ampelmann is one export East Germany bequeathed West, and it has taken off there big time. It was created in 1961 as a response to a rising tide of accidents in East Berlin. Its creator, traffic psychologist Karl Peglau, thought of a plump green man in a hat in order to make the sign both more visible and more human. It has worked. The German world is now littered with them, on road safety programmes, films, key fobs and card games. Fame indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
