The one we're meant to hope doesn't is Drake (Kenny Doughty), a London chancer getting his comeuppance for a illicit bunkup with a rival gangster's hot moll. But Ian is so nondescript it's hard to mind if one of the standard-issue baddies has their ethnically indeterminate way with him. The script acts on the film as a rock does when strapped to a corpse, but there's a certain noirish sheen to the cinematography that means the whole thing slips down sweeter than it really ought.
