They have hosted peace congresses that ended wars, like the one which led to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, and have been the place of consequential secret meetings, like the talks between Cavour and Napoleon III at Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains in 1858. On the other hand they have been the home of repression, as in the decrees adopted by Metternich and the German envoys at Carlsbad in 1819, and of reactionary governments, notably at Vichy from 1940. This week marks the 50th anniversary of one of the better days in spa history, the signing of accords between France and the FLN at \u00c9vian-les-Bains which paved the way for Algerian independence. Spa towns seem to belong to a slower age than ours. But that is exactly why it might not do any harm for protagonists in today's intractable arguments, such as Iran's nuclear programme, to also take the waters in search of solutions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
