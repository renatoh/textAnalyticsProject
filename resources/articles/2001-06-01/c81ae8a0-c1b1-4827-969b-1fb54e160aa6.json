None of his music had crossed the North Sea until this weekend, when his works dominated the first Saturday of the Aldeburgh festival. A morning composer-portrait programme in the Jubilee Hall included three of Ayres's works, while the same evening in Snape Maltings the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra gave the first performance of his festival commission under Sakari Oramo. It is always exciting to come across a new composer; but in this case the anticipation was misplaced. Hearing one of Ayres's pieces in isolation might just be momentarily intriguing; hearing a group of them was far less encouraging. It is music in which sheer incongruity matters more than content, and that tries all too hard to shock. Juxtaposing snatches of disintegrating military marches with washes of arpeggios, and corny tunes with unpitched noises and heavy breathing through a megaphone, as in his No 35 Overture for euphonium, timpani and two pianos, or having the trumpeter resort to playing a melodica in piece-with-running-from-left-to-right-and-back-again (1996) might have nuisance value, but precious little musical worth. Perhaps I'm getting too old for postmodern irony, but there were young composers inspired by Kagel doing the same things 20 years ago, and doing it far more pithily and far more wittily. Whatever Ayres absorbed from his time with Andriessen it certainly wasn't textural clarity or harmonic rigour. The same kind of gestures that had been exposed in the smaller-scale works were writ large in the new orchestral work, No 30 (NONcerto for orchestra, cello and high soprano voice), which featured lots of Lachenmann-like extra-musical effects from the cellist (Anton Lukoszevieze), more megaphone exhalations from the soprano (Anu Komsi) and more badly scored assertiveness for the orchestra. The CBSO performance under Oramo seemed fully committed, and indeed the rest of their concert was very fine: Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem, Janacek's Sinfonietta and a performance of Sibelius's Luonnotar with Komsi as the spell-binding soloist that was simply the best I've heard of this extraordinary masterpiece. After the Ayres, it was all the more gratefully received."}, "isHosted": false}}}
