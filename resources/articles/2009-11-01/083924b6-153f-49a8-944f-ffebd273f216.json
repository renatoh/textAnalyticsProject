Pronounced a \"national treasure\" by Gordon Brown, apparently for being inexhaustibly bouncy every Saturday on Strictly, she has bigger fish to fry than most former girl-group members. It's a wonder she's touring at all: her profile hardly needs raising, and the solo debut she is nominally promoting, The Alesha Show, came out a year ago. Having decided to hit the road, though, she is giving it her all. Her stage act is best thought of as a Venn diagram that incorporates the showgirl elements of Kylie Minogue and the sassy oomph of Beyonc\u00e9, with a set-jawed determination that is hers alone. The production budget, too, is a fraction of the Kylies and Beyonc\u00e9s of this world: she makes do and mends with just one costume change and a tireless six-man band. Even so, she twirled and hoofed as if cheered on by a full stadium. There was a whiff of Royal Variety Performance about things, especially on the va-va-voom squeals of The Boy Does Nothing, but when the band pounded out a Mis-Teeq medley, with sampled trumpets squawking and Dixon hitting the power notes, it was closer to an old-school soul revue. In Mis-Teeq, Dixon was a rapper and singer. As a reminder of that, she fired off a narky rap on Can I Begin, a vindictive number seemingly inspired by former husband MC Harvey's infidelity. But it was her singing that made the impression: she's more powerful than you would imagine, and when pitted against her band at their most blaring, she more than held her own. While this was going on, she was being flung between two male hoofers, proving, if nothing else, that pop stars who claim they can't dance and sing simultaneously just aren't trying. There was a good deal of burlesque-style embellishment: on The Boy Does Nothing she had a frothy tail of pink feathers stuck to her bottom, while Play Me was made faintly dirty by raucous drums and horn samples. It's premature to call Dixon a national treasure, but she makes the case that \"old-fashioned entertainer\" can be a title worth having."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
