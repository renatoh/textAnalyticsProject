Niels, of that name, was the father of the Copenhagen school of quantum mechanics \u2013 a fairy-tale land in which things could be in two places at the same time, things changed when you looked at them and cats could be both alive and dead. Now, the significance of \"Copenhagen\" might have changed for ever \u2013 like an electron that's been peeked at. The headlines are screaming about chaos and failure; disappearing island states saying that they have been betrayed; even Barack Obama admitting that a legally binding treaty will take \"some time\" to achieve. But, depending on the outcome of the political shenanigans, Copenhagen could still be a name as important for environmental science as it already is for physics. However things turn out, Copenhagen deserves a different sort of credit, perhaps even more significant than a step towards saving the planet. Copenhagen may mark a turning point in human nature, when the global village acquired a global mind. What we have just witnessed is delegates from 192 countries talking about making sacrifices, slowing their development, constraining their industry, taxing their citizens, in a collective bid to stifle climate change. Those nations included virtually every race, every religion, every style of government \u2013 from monarchy to dictatorship, from constitutional democracy to communism. For the past 5,000 years, agreements between nations have been determined by military or economic power, by political ideology or religious dogma. What Copenhagen has established, even if the final agreement fudges and procrastinates, is that a new force is at work in international diplomacy. A force that does not speak in terms of faith and conviction, that is not even absolutely certain about what it has to say. That force is science. Globally, the average temperature has risen by about 0.7C since pre-industrial times. That's a statistically significant shift (as the boffins would say), but it's not that evidence that has driven the unprecedented move towards global co-operation in Copenhagen. It's the predictions of future events \u2013 long after the terms of office of elected representatives and even the lifetimes of monarchs and dictators. The developing nations are unhappy with the offer of financial compensation from the affluent powers. But the amounts over the coming decades are staggering. All of this, and the policies, laws and taxes that will be needed to implement a real agreement, have been driven by the opinions of people of no specific race, creed or politics, and very little personal power \u2013 the scientists who have made the doomsday predictions. What's surprising about nations acting together to avert a common threat is that it runs counter to so much of what we know of human nature. A simple interpretation of Copenhagen would say the delegates were motivated by altruism and shared concern, reflecting a dispassionate assessment of risk and rational decision-making. But neither humans nor other animals normally behave like that. Assisting the survival of others who share your genes makes sense in evolutionary terms. When once asked whether he would give his life to save a drowning brother (sharing half his genetic make-up) the great British biologist JBS Haldane replied: \"No, but I would to save two brothers or eight cousins.\" What is remarkable, then, about Copenhagen is that individuals of such diverse genetic background could talk as they did about making sacrifices for each other. In his first major speech after winning the presidential election, Barack Obama said of the value of science: \"It's about listening to what our scientists have to say, even when it's inconvenient \u2013 especially when it's inconvenient.\" And in his inaugural address, he promised \"to restore science to its rightful place\". Even with its flaws, what Copenhagen suggests is that the rightful place of science is at the heart of policy for a threatened world. The oceans are already rising. Either we sink, separately, or swim, together. \u2022 Colin Blakemore is professor of neuroscience at the universities of Oxford and Warwick"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
