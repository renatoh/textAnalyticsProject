Leila, a fortysomething sex worker in Istanbul, has been murdered and dumped in a wheelie bin in the dark, damp outskirts of the city. But in the 10 minutes and 38 seconds after her heart stops beating, her mind continues to whirr, ranging over her memories, their scents and flavours. The novel, which opens in 1990, is not only a sensual journey into the complicated life of a prostitute known as \u201cTequila Leila\u201d but the story of her cherished friends \u2013 five social outcasts who are also considered trash in an increasingly illiberal country. Shafak wants to give a voice to society\u2019s untouchables: immigrants, underdogs and those who are considered freaks by their own families. \u201cThe Istanbul that Leila had known was not the Istanbul that the Ministry of Tourism would have wanted foreigners to see,\u201d she writes. Many of Shafak\u2019s themes are familiar from her previous work: violence against women, the massacre of Armenians, and the persecution of Yazidis, as well as the erosion of secularism and the rise of religious sects in Turkey. It\u2019s a novel with a powerful premise, good intentions and an ingenious framing device. What\u2019s more, Shafak is an inspiration to writers across the globe: a passionate feminist and champion of free speech who writes about political and sexual taboos. As a consequence, she has been threatened with jail time for \u201cinsulting Turkishness\u201d and can\u2019t risk returning to her homeland. In short, Shafak is very brave. What a shame, then, that 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange Land is so flat and flavourless. The novel\u2019s most vital moments occur at the beginning when Leila, dumped in a filthy bin, must face up to the fact that \u201cour individual passing had no impact on the order of things, and life would go on passing just the same with or without us\u201d. The problem is that Shafak\u2019s cliched prose soft-pedals the stark injustices she seeks to expose. Born in eastern Turkey, Leila is the daughter of her father\u2019s second wife, but she\u2019s raised by the first. As her father becomes increasingly devout, the women of the family are silenced and subjugated: \u201cThings were not always as they seemed,\u201d Shafak writes, \u201cthe sour could hide beneath the sweet, or vice versa\u2026\u201d At six, Leila has already fallen prey to a manipulative uncle who sneaks into her bed. When, at 16, Leila exposes her uncle, she\u2019s forced to leave school and marry her abuser\u2019s son. Horrified, she flees the family home for Istanbul, \u201cthe city where all the discontented and all the dreamers eventually ended up\u201d. As soon as she\u2019s drawn into prostitution, the novel becomes frustratingly remote from its protagonist. \u201cHow stubborn she was, how dangerously rebellious her soul,\u201d Shafak tells us, \u201cshe was the walking embodiment of imperfection.\u201d Yet it\u2019s hard to get a sense of Leila\u2019s adult self beyond those intimate moments in the bin at the beginning of the novel. The second half shifts focus to Leila\u2019s \u201cwater family\u201d \u2013 the outcasts who provide a safety net when her blood relatives desert her. There\u2019s Sabotage Sinan (a weak man who has been besotted with Leila since childhood), Nostalgia Nalan (a sassy transvestite), Zaynab122 (a Sunni dwarf from a Lebanese mountain village), Hollywood Humeyra (an overweight singer), and Jameelah (a beautiful Somalian who doesn\u2019t get a cute nickname). This group of oddballs are known as \u201cthe five\u201d, which makes them sound like a squad from a Marvel franchise. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accidental \u2013 there\u2019s something a little gimmicky and schematic about the whole setup. What begins as an incisive investigation into violence against women becomes both preachy and hammy as the friends go to dig up her grave and the action descends into farce. Humeyra, the fat friend, insists on packing a picnic before they dig up their mate. Weedy Sinan, the only man, falls into the grave. Where Shafak does excel is in conjuring Istanbul, a \u201cstruggling, competing, clashing\u201d place she can no longer visit. In many ways, the book is a love letter to the city and its most stirring passages bring alive its tensions: \u201cImperial Istanbul versus plebeian Istanbul; global Istanbul versus parochial Istanbul; cosmopolitan Istanbul versus philistine Istanbul; heretical Istanbul versus pious Istanbul; macho Istanbul versus feminine Istanbul\u2026 then there was the Istanbul of those who had left long ago, sailing to faraway ports. For them this city would always be a metropolis made of memories, myths and messianic longings, forever elusive like a lover\u2019s face receding in the mist.\u201d \u2022 10 Minutes 30 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).
