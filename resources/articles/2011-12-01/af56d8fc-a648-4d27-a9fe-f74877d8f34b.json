She won't be chamber-maiding forever because she's on a training scheme at luxury hotel, The Bath Priory, that will, hopefully, see her reach the pinnacle of the hospitality profession. But she has no problem learning her job from the bottom up. \"This is my trade,\" she says. \"I know I need to learn things very thoroughly to be able to do the job properly.\" Thomason isn't officially called an apprentice because, rather than being funded by the government, her training is designed, and paid for, by a group of 10 luxury hotels that have come together to foster the industry skills they struggle to find in the marketplace. This employer-instigated model of apprenticeship is the norm in many European countries; the 25 months Thomason, and nine other young people, will spend in some of England's classiest establishments will give them a depth of understanding that will likely mean their skills are in demand both at home and abroad when they finish. At the National Trust, 18-year-old Danielle Platt is two-thirds of the way through a three-year, government-funded plumbing apprenticeship that sees her working on lead piping and heating in heritage properties four days a week, and at Cornwall College studying the technical aspects of the job on the fifth. Her ambition is to progress to an HNC in building and construction and then become a building supervisor managing her own team. These are two models of how to be apprenticed to a trade. There's another kind, too; shorter, less ambitious in scope, not so in-depth and, many would argue, not nearly as good. Given that the chances of a young person today getting a job look bleak, the \u00a31.4bn the government is pumping into apprenticeships, both long and short, may seem a welcome route to decent pay and prospects. But it might pay to be wary before replying to those online or local paper ads which tempt you with dreams of gaining the kind of skills that will set you up for life. Though the word \"apprenticeship\" has real kudos, this is because, until recently, it's been associated with robust and thorough training over several years. Now, however, it seems like pretty much anything goes. You can do an apprenticeship that only takes a year or six months. Or, if you live near a De Vere Academy of Hospitality and fancy working in customer service, just 12 weeks to complete. This kind of timeframe, say critics, is inadequate to fit someone for a skilled job. \"The norm in Europe is three to four years with substantive off-the-job learning,\" says Ewart Keep, professor of social sciences at Cardiff University, who contributed to a recent book, Rethinking Apprenticeships, published by the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Association of Colleges. Protecting the apprenticeship brand, says Andy Wilson, principal of Westminster Kingsway College, is \"absolutely crucial\", and if short courses are allowed to proliferate, it will devalue. \"Employers have taken up people at the end of these 'apprenticeships' and have been totally disappointed,\" he says. \"I don't think [short courses] should be called apprenticeships. That should be stopped.\" The De Vere Academy of Hospitality's managing director Kellie Rixon disputes this criticism, saying the quality of the intensive classroom-based and on-the-job training provided means that, to date, 72% of De Vere apprentices \u2013 \"a lot of them have come from challenging backgrounds, been totally disengaged from education and respond to our employer-led model incredibly well\" \u2013 have gone straight into full-time employment. The explosion in numbers of apprentices \u2013 over 442,000 started in 2010, up from 280,000 the year before \u2013 has happened for a reason: skills minister John Hayes explains that his intention has been to do away with the variety of funding streams for different kinds of training and make apprenticeships \"fill the whole space; as a route into employment for under 24s, a route into higher learning, our principal work-based training offer and to link to the Work Programme\". This has meant that some provision, now labelled as an apprenticeship, can involve training at a very basic level. This year, alone, for example, Morrisons supermarket has taken advantage of the government's push on numbers \u2013 and the funding that goes with apprenticeships \u2013 to enroll 35,000 recently-started and existing employees on Level 2 apprenticeships of between six and 12 months run by a for-profit provider, Elmfield Training. Morrisons group HR director, Norman Pickavance says: \"The issue I'm trying to address is of social exclusion and people trapped in unemployment or entry level jobs with no hope of progressing.\" But there has been sharp criticism that this type of retail apprenticeship is either about companies using public money to pay for what may be little more than basic induction of new staff, or, in the case of existing employees, about accrediting skills they already possess, rather than adhering to the fundamental tenet of apprenticeship, which is about developing new ones. Nick Linford, managing director of Learning &amp; Skills \u2013 Events, Consultancy and Training (Lsect) and publisher of the further education newspaper FE Week, says the efficiencies achieved by providers such as Elmfield mean true apprenticeship training, in the traditional sense, isn't taking place. \"I am not against retail, or against older people receiving training; this is about protecting a very important product that will be destroyed if it's diluted,\" he says. While Pickavance says Morrisons has always provided staff training, he makes no bones that the apprenticeship funding isn't paying for much in the way of further skills development. Rather, it pays for assessors who mainly spend their time in-store observing and accrediting employees' existing skills in order to award paper qualifications. If that funding was removed, he says, \"we would continue with excellent training. But regarding qualifications, they're not necessary for our business, so we would stop and pause on that I think.\" Morrisons is not alone \u2013 Asda has recently enrolled over 4,000 employees on apprenticeships of a year or less. But these companies are, in fact, only doing what the government told them it wants. And while the expansion in numbers means that, in the government's view, the policy has been a success, figures show that last year 40% of the increase came from adults over 25, compared to 18% the year before. Given that within this age range older people are more likely to have some skills and experience, questions are now being asked about whether directing scarce resources to mature workers means that teenagers, desperate for the skills required simply to enter the workforce, are losing out. It seems the criticism may have hit home: in November, new government funding of \u00a31,500 per apprentice was announced to encourage small- and medium-sized businesses to take on more apprentices in the 16-24 age group. Hayes also acknowledges that, in some cases, the rapid increase in numbers has affected the quality of training, and says that a degree of \"recalibration\" must now take place. Linford adds: \"What's upset me the most is when we've had tip-offs from young people who've done a short apprenticeship, and not been able to find a job at the end of it because they don't have employable skills. They tell us they've then gone to college to see if they can do another course and the college has said, 'Sorry we can't help you, your funding's been spent'.\" The National Apprenticeship Service has just been told to review training of less than three months' duration, and David Way, chief operating officer at NAS, is adamant that what he terms \"so-called apprenticeships\" of three to six months won't be around for much longer. Weeding out all such provision, however, will be quite a task. The number of apprenticeship training providers has mushroomed because funding for the scheme works like this: no matter how long or short the training course, the allocation per apprentice is the same \u2013 up to \u00a35,000 of taxpayers' money. Unsurprisingly, there are plenty of takers for that kind of cash who have deduced there is money to be made. As a not-for-profit initiative, the De Vere Academy says its surplus on apprenticeships was just \u00a317,000 last year, every penny of which was re-invested. But Elmfield Training made \u00a312m on a 2009-10 turnover of almost \u00a334m. While the company says this shows they are running a highly- efficient training model, with profits comparable to others in the industry, critics wonder whether such a level of surplus should be made at a time when tens of thousands of young people are out of work and in desperate need of training and support. Elmfield says its schemes \"deliver and tackle significant numeracy and literacy issues, and we devote considerable effort and resources into 'system failure' \u2013 putting right things that should have been done properly at school or in college. For these reasons, we feel that the state's contribution is warranted.\" With Hayes now stating that he wants more apprenticeships at Levels 4 and 5, it will be interesting to see whether employers embrace the far more stringent training requirements these would involve with the same alacrity that they enrolled employees on to lower-level apprenticeships, that don't require much \u2013 if any \u2013 time off the shop floor.
