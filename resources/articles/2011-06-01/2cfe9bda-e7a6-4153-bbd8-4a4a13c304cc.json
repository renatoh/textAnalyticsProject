Hendrix already had years on the US touring circuit as a backing musician when the former Animal, Chas Chandler, brought him to London, set him up with a band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and let him loose on the world. Hendrix transformed guitar playing, both in technique and showmanship. And, along the way, he wrote some pretty decent songs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
