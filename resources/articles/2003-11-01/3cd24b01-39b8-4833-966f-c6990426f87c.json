As for an official press conference, well, don't be utterly ridiculous. To draw parallels between this week's fevered abandon and 1966 is to compare Tracey Emin with cave painting. The nearest 1966's lot got to a parade through the capital was the fleeting appearance of Bobby Moore's team (with Prime Minister Harold Wilson attempting to muscle in) on the balcony of the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington after the post-match banquet where the cup was displayed to a \"throng\" of fewer than a couple of hundred. Around noon the following day a coach left the hotel to take most of the squad to Lew Grade's ATV studios at Elstree (prearranged for a \u00a375 fee to the players' kitty: less than \u00a33 10s old money each) where they were shown watching the afternoon re-run of the match. An official press conference after the great game itself? You're joking. That Sunday morning in the summer of 1966 the press pack took the train down to Elstree just in case. Three of Alf Ramsey's perceived favourite scribes - Ken Jones of the Mirror, Clive Toye of the Express and Brian James of the Mail - were deputed to approach the manager for just one quotable sentence for the Monday morning prints. Alf regarded them with his customary disdainful gravity: \"It's Sunday. My day off. You know I never give interviews on my day off.\" End, literally, of story. Little Johnny and mighty Paddy Most touching aspect of this frenzied and torrentially quotable week 37 years on has been the modest lack of triumphalism in Martin Johnson's squad as well as, once the deed was done, the generously chivalrous honouring of the foe by the defeated Australian team and their supporters - the only exception being the mean-spirited glumness displayed by the cold-eyed squirt who presented the trophy itself, the Oz premier John Howard. I dare say Howard is one of those suspicious Aussies who still have an insecurity problem with England's approach to sporting outcomes. It is an ancient dilemma. The first rugby union match between the two countries was won 9-3 by Australia at Blackheath in 1909. Their captain was the legendary flanker Paddy Moran, who was still puzzled when he wrote his memoirs 30 years later . . . \"We beat them by three tries to one; no small margin. I thought the match was played in excellent spirit but I awoke on Monday morning to find that according to some newspapers we had been up to our dirty tricks again. Is it any wonder that we all believe the Englishman is petulant in defeat? No one, however, can deny that an Englishman wins splendidly. He accepts success as his due, is never cock-a-hoop, never triumphs clamorously. With perfect manners he commends the losers' great display; was it not quite gloriously worthy of the example he, himself, had set the world?\" After the Hill's, the Keatings So William Hill's \u00a312,000 prize for 2003's sports book of the year goes to Tom Bower, deservedly I suppose but his title says it all - Broken Dreams: Vanity, Greed and the Souring of British Football. Excluding the Tiger Woods biography the books on this year's short list deal not so much with sport - lovely innocent sport - but contention, strife and hostility. For my part this winter I shall be warming my cockles of back-page romance with a more wholesome and appealing short list, tucking contentedly into such as Stephen Chalke and co-author Derek Hodgson's immaculate monograph on Bob Appleyard, evanescent wonder bowler of half a century ago (No Coward Soul, Fairfield Books, \u00a316), Grahame Lloyd's big-hearted and heartening tale of the league's bargain basement (One Hell of a Season, Celluloid, \u00a314.99), David Miller's de luxe definitive doorstop on a century of Olympic endeavour and achievement (Athens to Athens, Mainstream, \u00a335) and the beautifully written post-war chronicle of Southampton FC (In That Number, Hagiology, \u00a335), the most lavish and capacious club history imaginable. The engaging foreword by Matthew Le Tissier is a revelation and the only sadness is that Southampton's most saintly eminence Ted Bates, who served the club in eight different guises and who died at 85 on Tuesday, did not live to relish and savour every one of its 628 pages. The longest Test innings ends The passing of another ancient hands over a different baton. The death of the former New Zealand batsman GL \"Dad\" Weir at 95 means the oldest surviving Test cricketer becomes Morappa Gopolan (born January 6 1909), who played one Test for India, against Douglas Jardine's England at Calcutta in 1934, when he scored 18 runs, took one wicket (Jim Langridge) and caught the first three England batsmen (Cyril Walters, Charlie Barnett and \"Ticker\" Mitchell). England's oldest Test player remains Norman Mitchell-Innes (90 next summer). Meanwhile the Westcliff-on-Sea postmen will be on overtime next Wednesday when England's celebrated \"barnacle\" Trevor Bailey celebrates his birthday - 80 not out, a typical Trevor innings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
