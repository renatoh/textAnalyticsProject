Paine died thinking he had failed, explained Cal McCrystal in the Independent on Sunday: \"Nevertheless, today, nearly half of the world's nations have democratic elections and the freedoms which Paine's revolutionary generation hoped to achieve.\" \"Trickster Travels: In Search of Leo Africanus, a 16th-century Muslim Between Worlds is a masterpiece of scholarship,\" declared Michael Binyon in the Times, \"tracking down this elusive and ambiguous polymath who moved between two clashing worlds and was embraced by neither.\" \"Natalie Zemon Davis has spent 40 years studying the man, his work and his world and she is better placed than almost anyone else to recreate him,\" observed Anthony Sattin in the Sunday Times. \"But what starts as absorbing historical narrative turns into the sort of dry textual analysis that belongs in academic journals, not a book for general readers. By the end ... this reader had stopped caring.\" \"'Whatever else, one must not be boring',\" wrote Sam Alexandroni in the New Statesman. \"Davis quotes this golden rule of Arab literature without paying enough attention to it herself.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
