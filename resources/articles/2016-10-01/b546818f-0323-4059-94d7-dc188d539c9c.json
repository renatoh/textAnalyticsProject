The artist was criticised as \u201carrogant\u201d by a prominent member of the academy that awards the prize last week, having failed to respond to repeated calls. Even a brief acknowledgement of the award was removed from his website soon after it appeared. But, in a call with Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, Dylan said: \u201cI appreciate the honour so much,\u201d adding: \u201cThe news about the Nobel prize left me speechless.\u201d And, in a separate interview with the Daily Telegraph \u2013 his first since the award \u2013 he said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d attend an award ceremony \u201cif it\u2019s at all possible\u201d. Dylan told the paper: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe \u2026 amazing, incredible. Whoever dreams about something like that?\u201d The Nobel Foundation, which released details of Dylan\u2019s conversation with Danius on Friday, said it had not yet been decided if the artist would \u201cattend any events during the Nobel week in Stockholm in December\u201d. \u201cThe Nobel Foundation will share information as soon as it is available.\u201d Dylan\u2019s spokesman did not respond to requests for clarification. Making the award announcement, Danius compared Dylan\u2019s work to that of ancient Greek writers Homer and Sappho. Asked about the comparison, Dylan said: \u201cI suppose so, in some way. Some [of my own] songs \u2013 \u201cBlind Willie\u201d, \u201cThe Ballad of Hollis Brown\u201d, \u201cJoey\u201d, \u201cA Hard Rain\u201d, \u201cHurricane\u201d and some others \u2013 definitely are Homeric in value.\u201d He declined to remark on the meanings of those songs, however. \u201cI\u2019ll let other people decide what they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe academics, they ought to know. I\u2019m not really qualified. I don\u2019t have any opinion.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a certain intensity in writing a song,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to keep in mind why you are writing it and for who and what for.\u201d The singer also tied songwriting to his interests in painting and sculpting, though he recognized that not all of his ambitions would achieve the same success as his music. \u201cI\u2019d like to drive a race car on the Indianapolis track. I\u2019d like to kick a field goal in an NFL football game. I\u2019d like to be able to hit a hundred-mile-an-hour baseball. But you have to know your place.\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be some things that are beyond your talents. \u201cEverything worth doing takes time. You have to write a hundred bad songs before you write one good one. And you have to sacrifice a lot of things that you might not be prepared for. Like it or not, you are in this alone and have to follow your own star.\u201d The academy announced that Dylan would be awarded the prize on 13 October, saying he had \u201ccreated new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d. But that was followed by silence, leading to criticism of Dylan and speculation over whether or not he would even accept the honour. On the night that the announcement was made, Dylan played a gig in Las Vegas but did not refer to the news. A week later, the words \u201cwinner of the Nobel prize in literature\u201d appeared on his website, along with a promotion of a new book of his lyrics. But that had been taken down by the next day. Soon afterwards, in comments broadcast on a Swedish television station, the writer and academy member Per Wastberg said Dylan\u2019s failure to respond to overtures was \u201cimpolite and arrogant\u201d and put the academy in an \u201cunprecedented situation\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
