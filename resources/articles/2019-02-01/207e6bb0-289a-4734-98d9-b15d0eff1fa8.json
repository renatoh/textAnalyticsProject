Six people have been suspended for their role in the closed Facebook group Ligue du LOL, a macho online \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d that reportedly harassed female and minority ethnic journalists for years. The group, believed to have had about 30 members, is said to have spread pornographic memes online and doctored photos to humiliate its victims. What group members claim started as dubious humour in private exchanges, however, appears to have soon degenerated and spread on to the wider web mostly through Twitter. It seems some of the victims were aware of the identity of a number of their alleged harassers \u2013 those members of the Ligue who posted on social networks under their real names \u2013 but were afraid to speak out. The league\u2019s founder, Vincent Glad, was suspended by Lib\u00e9ration newspaper on Monday after the paper verified the existence of the group during a fact-checking exercise. Among others being disciplined are one of Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s senior online editors, Alexandre Hervaud, and David Doucet, the web editor-in-chief of Les Inrockuptibles, a high-profile music and culture magazine. Doucet wrote on Twitter: \u201cI was a member of the Ligue du LOL for two years. I left the group six years ago \u2026 in the small world that was then Twitter, I saw that certain people were regularly targeted but I never guessed the depth of the trauma suffered. I was cowardly and too happy to be one of this band that the Twittersphere then admired, to intervene \u2026 I would like to say that I never did any of the photomontages, took part in raids or participated in the evenings described. This speaking out has above all made me realise that I was one of the tormentors.\u201d Hervaud wrote a long message on Twitter apologising for \u201ccondescending\u201d tweets he had posted on Friday when the scandal first broke, and said he offered \u201csincere if belated apologies to those he had hurt\u201d. He said the Ligue \u201cnever aimed to coordinate hateful campaigns targeting anyone. But it doesn\u2019t serve to minimise or deny the evidence. The permanent spirit of mockery and cynicism of the group obviously influenced the actions of certain more borderline members, notably those covered by anonymity, who, by the snowball effect inspired other internet users outside the group.\u201d He admitted some of the victim statements had \u201cliterally twisted my stomach\u201d. Christophe Carron, the editor of the French edition of the online magazine Slate, also admitted having been a member of the group but denied \u201csocially or professionally damaging anyone \u2026 or harassing anyone\u201d. The Lib\u00e9ration director, Laurent Joffrin, announced an internal investigation. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said. In an apology published on Twitter, Glad said he had \u201ccreated a monster that escaped\u201d. \u201cThe object of the group was not to harass women, just to amuse ourselves. But quickly, our way of amusing ourselves became very problematic and we didn\u2019t realise this. We thought that everyone visible on the internet, by a blog, or Twitter account or something else, deserved to be mocked,\u201d Glad wrote. He added that he didn\u2019t realise that this could \u201cbecome a hell for the people targeted\u201d. Other Ligue members who have been suspended from their roles include Guilhem Malissen, a humorist on food podcast Bouffons, who apologised on Twitter; Renaud Loubert-Aledo, who worked at Publicis Consultants; and Guillaume Ledit, a journalist with Usbek &amp; Rica, a quarterly magazine \u201cexploring the future\u201d. Another member, Stephen des Aulnois, the founder of online pornographic magazine Tag Parfait, said he was suspending the website and stepping down voluntarily. The videomaker Florence Porcel said she had been the victim of an \u201conline lynching\u201d and had been humiliated when a member of the Ligue du LOL called her pretending to offer her a job, while recording the conversation. \u201cWhen the recording was made public, I cried from shame, humiliation and fear for three days. I didn\u2019t want to go out,\u201d she said. Porcel said she had also featured in a \u201cvery degrading pornographic photomontage \u2026 that was their method\u201d. Doucet admitted in a tweet that he had posed as a recruiter from a television station and called Porcel. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he wrote. The blogger and author Matthias Jambon-Puillet recounted, under his pseudonym Benjamin LeReilly, receiving anonymous insults and that a photomontage of him performing a sex act was sent \u2013 purportedly from him \u2013 to minors. Although he does not know who sent the insults, he said he believed they came from members of the league. The journalist M\u00e9lanie Wanga said she believed the league\u2019s members were finally getting what they deserved. \u201cImagine being a young, black woman journalist talking about blackface and apartheid and getting this stuff multiplied by 20 from your \u2018colleagues\u2019,\u201d she said, sharing tweets she suspected had come from unidentified members of the league. Capucine Piot, a former journalist now in marketing, said she had been the victim of several \u201cmocking\u201d photomontages and videos criticising her appearance. \u201cIt was very hard for a developing young woman. After reading so much dirt about myself \u2026 I was convinced I was worthless,\u201d she tweeted. Other victims have remained anonymous. \u201cThose guys, they thought they were making jokes but they were ruining our lives,\u201d said one. France\u2019s minister for digital affairs, Mounir Mahjoubi, described the men behind the Facebook group as \u201closers\u201d. \u201cIt is a group of guys high on their power at being able to make fun of other people. Except that their mockery had an effect in real life,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
