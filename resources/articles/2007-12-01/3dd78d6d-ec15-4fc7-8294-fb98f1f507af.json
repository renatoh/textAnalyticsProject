Organised by All Tomorrow's Parties, the fourth Nightmare, with its winning formula of chalets, intimate gigs and no corporate involvement, offered the perfect backdrop for the reclusive band, who curated the weekend and gave two performances. Hearing Dummy live after 10 years devoid of Portishead gigs and new material was delicious closure for fans as Beth Gibbons's clear, emotive voice sang out mercifully undiminished. Five new numbers were trialled, with hip hop now replaced by trance and jazzy influences, but how relevant a third Portishead album can be in 2008 is unclear. The crowd were ecstatic, the band revelled in the adulation, but would anyone have cared if Portishead had been as ubiquitous as Massive Attack over the past 10 years? But this was Portishead's moment, which was just as well because behind the trip hop glitter much of the rest of the festival line-up was disappointing. Mark Linkous played solo as Sparklehorse in an underwhelming set, Julian Cope bored with Eighties rock pomp, Rosie Red Rash - an all-girl teen punk band from Bristol - flicked their hair self-consciously, while a room of ageing white people excruciatingly threw Ws at Wu-Tang Clan's GZA. Elsewhere, the Horrors lived up to the NME hype with a spectacular performance, while Brooklynites Oneida shone with their energetic nu-rave rock and awesome drumming. How many of these acts were chosen by Portishead? Hopefully not Glaswegian so-called comedian Jerry Sadowitz, who tainted the whole weekend with an hour of hatred and tired jokes at the expense of every minority imaginable. Thankfully, as the cold sea wind whipped around Butlins' dome, Aphex Twin restored the glow of Nineties nostalgia with his two-hour DJ set of feel-good beats and bleeps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
