Although operating on the outskirts of the LA jazz community, she shares the traditional craftsmanship of that thriving scene: mining pastoral British folk of the 1960s and the blossoming symphonic soul of 70s Minnie Riperton. (As a child, Bonet first learned the violin, jacked it in, then started and subsequently left film school before learning the flute and other instruments.) Her lyrics are similarly verdant: \u201cHoney dewdrops\u201d form while characters sit \u201cbeneath a tree who wept in shades of pink\u201d. Its leading single, Nobody Other, is the pinnacle of an album whose tracks, while vivid in their hazy atmospherics \u2013 warm August evenings! Funny fags! \u2013 occasionally float so fluffily, their essence peters out like vapour trails."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
