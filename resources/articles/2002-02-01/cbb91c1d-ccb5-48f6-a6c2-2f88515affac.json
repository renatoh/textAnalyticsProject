When an England captain smashes an opponent in the face on live television immediately prior to a Six Nations weekend there is no escape from public scrutiny and, as Johnson accepted yesterday, the punchline can be distinctly unfunny. As yet the Rugby Football Union's disciplinary officer Robert Horner has made no decision on whether to follow up last Saturday's incident involving the Saracens hooker Robbie Russell. But the tone of both Johnson and the England manager Clive Woodward at the team's hotel in Bagshot betrayed obvious concern that the Leicester lock may yet be suspended for next month's crucial game against France in Paris. In expressing his regret for the punch which left Russell requiring six stitches below his left eye, Johnson held his hands up high, admitting he had \"overreacted\" after being barged into from behind. \"I shouldn't have done it. I knew that as soon as it happened,\" acknowledged the Lions captain, unable to explain why he had lost his cool after a season in which he has mostly shown huge restraint in the face of far worse provocation. \"Obviously I regret it but if you do something like that you've got to be accountable for your actions. I caught him with a jab when I turned round. It wasn't even a big punch or anything, but when he moved away and I saw the blood streaming from the eye I thought, 'Oh God, I could be in trouble here.' \"I've played rugby long enough to know that it's wrong and you've got a chance of being sent off. I was disappointed with myself. You have to be a role model, and I will accept whatever happens. The regrettable thing is that the game is much cleaner than it has ever been.\" Neither Johnson nor Woodward, mercifully, agreed with Leicester's chief executive Peter Wheeler that Johnson was the victim of a media witchhunt. Woodward, having studied the video, admitted his captain had \"let himself down\" in the build-up to Saturday's encounter with Ireland at Twickenham. Unlike his French counterpart Bernard Laporte, however, who has dropped his lock David Auradou and left his former captain Fabien Pelous on the bench against Wales this weekend as punishment for yellow cards, Woodward is less concerned with storming the moral high ground than stressing the danger of condemning only the retaliatory punch and not always the events leading up to it. \"I use Martin as an example of someone who gets extreme provocation and has been able to keep his self-control in very heated situations in international rugby and walk away,\" said the manager, pointing out that Johnson has not been yellow-carded for England since 1999. \"In my opinion his conduct both as captain and a role model has been outstandingly good considering the position he plays and the way he plays the game. What happened on Saturday night, in my opinion, doesn't change anything. It's up to other people to work out if that's the end of the incident. If we lose Martin Johnson for the French game there's nothing I can do about it. I'll never try to interfere. If we lose him we lose him and I'll coach the team from whoever I can select from.\" Woodward, though, made it clear he had no interest in picking either a neutered Johnson or a loose cannon, a nod towards the player's five-week suspension for foul play last season and his unsavoury 1997 assault on the New Zealand scrum-half Justin Marshall. \"It's absolutely critical he plays right on the edge for England but it's also critical he knows when to take a step back. \"I would not pick a player for England who I didn't think could handle himself but we've learnt very expensive lessons about playing players who can't keep their bloody cool. If you talk to the international refereeing community the team they most like refereeing is England.\" Woodward wound up the case for the defence in the traditional manner - \"Let's be honest, a lot of punches have been thrown in rugby union over the years\" - but there is increasing pressure on the RFU to do some- thing. Bringing any sport into disrepute is a relative concept in the wake of Mike Tyson's recent antics but Twickenham can expect hoots of derision from across the Channel if it does nothing at all. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
