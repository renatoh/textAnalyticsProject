She is, however, a big fan of the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s pantsuits. Dunham, the star and creator of HBO\u2019s Girls, laid out her support for Clinton at two events in Iowa on Saturday, while urging crowds of mostly women to get involved in the Iowa caucus on 1 February. \u201cNothing gets me angrier than when someone implies I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton simply because she\u2019s female,\u201d said Dunham at her first event of the day, to laughter. \u201c[It\u2019s] as if I have some feminist version of beer-goggles, lets call it \u2018estrogen blindness\u2019, and I just kind of walk like a zombie towards the nearest vagina. This assumption is condescending at best and it is sharply misogynistic at worst.\u201d Dunham said she was supporting Clinton \u201cbecause of her policies, because of her track record, because of her beliefs \u2013 and a little bit because of her pantsuits. But that\u2019s my prerogative as a citizen.\u201d The actress has been a vocal supporter of Clinton for much of the candidate\u2019s second run for the presidency, and has been known to drop by campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. Dunham recently interviewed Clinton for the first issue of her email newsletter, Lenny. Seated across from Clinton on a folding chair, she asked the Democratic candidate: \u201cDo you consider yourself a feminist?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Clinton responded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d With her trademark mix of raw candor and playful self-deprecation, on Saturday Dunham told the crowd how she had not voted until four years after she came of voting age. She encouraged women, especially young women, to make their voices heard in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say this but it took me far too long to start voting,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cI had been of legal age for more than four years before I cast my first vote in the 2008 presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t care, but I didn\u2019t believe that me caring mattered. It was impossible for me to comprehend that one young woman checking a box after waiting in a long line could matter on a national level.\u201d Dunham said she almost turned down the opportunity to create a video for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. She said deciding to make the innuendo-laced film, Your First Time, energized her to engage with politics. \u201cMy father has never been prouder of me than when I was called a dirty word on Fox News,\u201d Dunham joked about reaction to the video, which she said went \u201ca little bit viral\u201d. The campaign also promoted a chance for Iowa supporters to meet Dunham, raffling off a lunch date to supporters who signed up for the campaign\u2019s text updates. The woman who won the contest, Sarah Hinchliff Pearson, published an open letter to Dunham, expressing her admiration. On Friday, Dunham traveled around New Hampshire with the World Cup-winning soccer superstar Abby Wambach, pitching Clinton as the best advocate for women and the best candidate for the White House. Notably, Dunham has been having fun with her bespoke Hillary Clinton line of dresses and sweaters. In Iowa on Saturday, she wore a white jumper featuring \u201cHillary\u201d printed in red. The trips seemed aimed at young women, a seemingly natural fit for Clinton\u2019s message. But recent polls have shown an age gap between Clinton and supporters of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator winning more support from people under 45. In Iowa the audience, equal parts Dunham fans and Clinton supporters, were very receptive. Abbie Gould, 24, said she was still deciding between Clinton and Sanders, but was impressed by what Dunham had to say. \u201cListening to Lena, hearing the sincerity in her voice and listening to how she got involved in the campaign, and that she actually hadn\u2019t gotten involved into politics until later in her career, I think that\u2019s inspiring for people my age,\u201d Gould said. Allison Poss, who runs a small business, Girls with Ideas, in Iowa City, called Dunham and Clinton the \u201cdream team\u201d. Poss said she was an unabashed Dunham fan \u2013 she collects clippings of every magazine interview she gives \u2013 and a longtime Clinton supporter. \u201cI\u2019ve always followed [Clinton\u2019s] policies, that is what is driving my vote for her,\u201d she said, after the event at a coffee shop in Iowa City. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s like a double-whammy of happiness to me that she just so happens to be a woman as well.\u201d Maggie Mineart, 26, said Dunham\u2019s message really resonated with her, and that she \u201cappreciated having someone who is a peer, or pretty close to a peer\u201d speak about the issues that are important this election, including paid family leave and healthcare. \u201cIt would be cool to have a woman president, but that\u2019s not why I would vote for her,\u201d Minearet said after the event at a screen printing studio in Des Moines. \u201cIf I wanted to just vote for a woman, I could vote for Carly Fiorina too, but I\u2019m not.\u201d Mineart said she was still deliberating over the top two Democratic contenders and planned to attend a Sanders campaign event in Iowa later that evening. Of Dunham, Mineart added: \u201cOh \u2013 her outfit was really on point.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
