The explosive dynamic range required to maximise its impact \u2013 particularly for albums recorded in the pre-CD era \u2013 is fundamental to the listening experience, and so the rebirth of Slayer's Reign in Blood as a 12-inch piece of 180g plastic (along with nine more of the band's full-lengths) makes complete sense. For the uninitiated, the Californian band's third album came out in 1986 and is still widely regarded as the ultimate extreme metal statement: 29 minutes and 3 seconds of untamed savagery, lyrical horror and a level of intense physicality that has never been matched, it starts with the greatest thrash anthem of them all \u2013 Angel of Death \u2013 and ends with the second greatest \u2013 Raining Blood. The other eight tracks are all classics, too. A perfect album on any format, Reign in Blood becomes an unstoppable rollercoaster ride into the depths of the abyss on vinyl. Just as Satan intended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
