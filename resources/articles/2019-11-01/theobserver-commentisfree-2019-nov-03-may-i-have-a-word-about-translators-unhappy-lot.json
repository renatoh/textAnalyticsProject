It kicks off: \u201cIn addition, for Designated Window Personnel, purchases or sales of Company Securities made pursuant to, and in compliance with, a written plan that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a \u201cTrading Plan\u201d), may be made without restriction to any particular period provided that (i) the Trading Plan was established in good faith, in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1\u2026\u201d I think you get the drift. The sentence continues for another 245 words. And the translator\u2019s lament? He had to render this brain shredder into Welsh. Now I hope you\u2019re feeling lithe and limber and that you\u2019ve done your daily dozen. Because agility is now the thing, in business at least. A recent report suggests \u201cEnterprise agility \u2013 the ability to change direction quickly \u2013 is a decisive factor in today\u2019s digital world\u201d. Furthermore: \u201cAgile coaching plays a vital role in helping companies on their journey, but only if the coaching aspect is taken as seriously as agility. When more skilful business relationships and high-trust environments are established\u2026 organisations are better placed to leverage the process of agile... through coaching and facilitation techniques, we are able to unlock the behaviours and limiting beliefs that people and organisations have about themselves.\u201d Journeys, behaviours, leverage? Pah. Elsewhere, we are informed: \u201cThe increments are regularly inspected and adapted against the overall goals and as those goals evolve the iterative nature of the work means strategy and direction can be changed easily.\u201d Now here\u2019s a fitting task for my plucky translator \u2013 put this bilge into English. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
