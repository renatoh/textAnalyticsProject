The merest glimpse of summer, and we're frolicking half-naked in the chilly spring winds, loose limbs in all their goose-bumped glory. And then the full horror hits: shorts and swimwear that display our annual slippage as faithfully as clingfilm on a Christmas turkey. \"If only we'd done a bit more exercise,\" we groan. But how? Getting into one of these industrial sports bras is strenuous enough, and without an advanced qualification in yoga it's all too easy to end up like a bondage display gone wrong. And as for the local pool, the last thing I want is to don the dreaded lycra - only to be mistaken for a stray jellyfish tangled in seaweed. So why not save ourselves the trauma, and park our trainers for good? As Edward Stanley once remarked: \"Those who think they have not time for bodily exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness\" \u2013 although we don't necessarily need to stomach-crunch our way to good health either. Current guidelines recommend at least thirty minutes of moderate physical activity five days a week, and whether we're washing the car, chasing the kids in the garden, or simply taking the dog for a walk, we only need to move our bodies enough to breathe a little deeper and feel a little warmer for it to count. But despite growing evidence that physical activity helps prevent obesity, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, osteoporosis and even depression, the number of people achieving minimum recommendations continues to fall. Over a quarter of the UK population are now classified as inactive, and recent estimates by the World Health Organization rank inactivity as one of the ten leading causes of death in developed countries. In a culture that places great importance on preserving youth and longevity, why do we continue to abandon the most potent anti-ageing treatment of all? To estimate how potent these effects might be in the UK, I looked to data from the 1990 UK National Fitness Survey, which collected detailed physical activity reports from over 4000 men and women on the four weeks before their interview. Using tagged mortality records from the next sixteen years, I was able to show that even very modest amounts of reported physical activity \u2013 as little as one to four occasions of moderate or vigorous activity longer than twenty minutes \u2013 were associated with a roughly 30% reduced risk of mortality. This was true for all age, BMI and socioeconomic groups. Yet research shows that even among those who don't meet the recommended guidelines, 60% still overestimate their true level of physical activity, with many of us falsely believing we're doing enough already. And unless the inactive identify themselves as such, public health messages will only preach to the converted. But what if we simply measure people's physical activity using a scientific method and tell people the result? Could it make any difference? This is the question behind my main research study, a randomised trial known as FAB (Feedback, Awareness and Behaviour). To measure the effect, we ask volunteers to wear a small device known as an Actiheart, a combined heart rate and movement sensor that attaches to their chest with the help of sticky electrodes. Weighing less than a few grams, it is a discreet device that allows us to record the volunteers' movement and heart rate over six days and nights, and to compute an overall physical activity score at the end. So that we can compare different kinds of feedback against a 'control' condition, volunteers are then allocated to one of four groups by chance, helping to make sure the groups are the same to start with. While one group receives a questionnaire only, the remaining groups receive one of three levels of feedback and the same questionnaire. A month later, we ask them to wear the Actiheart monitor again, enabling us to monitor any change in physical activity. The results? Still eagerly awaited. But their importance lies not just in the possibility of a positive effect, but in the impact of 'desirable' results on behaviour too, about which we know very little. While some may be motivated to keep up the good work, others may be falsely reassured and perceive less need to stay active. And at the other end of the scale, undesirable feedback could result in worry or anxiety, prompting fatalistic attitudes and reduced activity. Only time will tell. But whatever the outcome, the hope is that it will lend just a little more evidence-based muscle to the ongoing campaign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
