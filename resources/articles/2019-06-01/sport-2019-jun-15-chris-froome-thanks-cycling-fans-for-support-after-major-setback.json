The four-time Tour de France winner came off his bike and hit a wall at 37mph on Wednesday while examining a time-trial stage route in the Crit\u00e9rium de Dauphin\u00e9. He sustained multiple fractures, including a broken leg, elbow and several ribs, requiring extensive surgery. It has been also been reported that Froome suffered a fractured neck, faces six weeks in hospital and is not expected to compete again this year. \u201cI know how lucky I am to be here today and how much I owe to all the paramedics and medical staff on the race,\u201d said Froome. \u201cWhilst this is a setback and a major one at that, I am focusing on looking forward. There is a long road to recovery ahead, but that recovery starts now and I am fully focused on returning back to my best.\u201d The post was issued with a picture of Froome giving the thumbs up from his bed at the University Hospital of St Etienne, where he has been receiving treatment. \u201cI just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has sent their best wishes to me since the crash,\u201d added Froome. \u201cThis is obviously a tough time but I have taken a lot of strength from the support over the last three days. The outpouring of support has been really humbling and something I would never have expected. \u201cI\u2019d also like to extend my gratitude to the team, especially [Team Ineos] doctor Richard Usher and his medical staff, who have been exemplary since the crash. In addition, I am so thankful to the emergency services and everyone at Roanne Hospital who assisted and stabilised me, as well as the surgeons, doctors and nurses at the University Hospital of St Etienne, who have really gone above and beyond the call of duty, for which I am ever so grateful.\u201d Froome took his hand off his handlebars to blow his nose before a gust of wind destabilised his bike. He crashed into a wall and lost consciousness. The Briton was airlifted to hospital where he has since been joined by his wife Michelle. Meanwhile, Wout Poels gave Team Ineos something to celebrate by winning stage seven of the Dauphin\u00e9, as Britain\u2019s Adam Yates lost his grip on the overall lead. The Dutchman let out a huge roar as he won on the Montee de Pipay, having bridged across to leading duo Jakob Fuglsang and Emanuel Buchmann in the last kilometre before beating the pair to the finish line. Astana\u2019s Fuglsang did enough to claim the yellow jersey from Yates, who will start Sunday\u2019s final stage with an eight-second disadvantage. Poels\u2019s first stage victory of the year moved him up to fifth, 28 seconds behind Fuglsang. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice for the team and it\u2019s a gift for Chris also,\u201d said Poels. \u201cI felt pretty strong all day. The team did an amazing job.\u201d Speaking to Eurosport, Poels added: \u201cI hope he watches this one, it was really for Chris, especially with what happened this week. [It\u2019s] really nice for the team and I also hope it gives Chris strength to be come really strong back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
