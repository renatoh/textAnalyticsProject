His skin is peachy and fresh. His 58-year-old face is surprisingly unlined, despite the sometimes windswept little pouch under his chin that makes him look so haggard in photographs. His stripy, liquorice allsort hair is shiny. In a month in which the Labour party he leads has polled the lowest share of a national vote since the first world war (less than 16% in the European elections), in which he has faced an attempted coup, mass resignations, a cabinet in turmoil, almost all the press turned against him, the prime minister is solicitous - \"Tea? Coffee? Sparkling water? You can drink too much tea ... Aren't you freezing?\" - and jokes about the so-called Hotmail plot, brushing off suggestions that his political career is all but over. \"I wouldn't exaggerate how bad it's been,\" he says. I spend a morning and an afternoon with the prime minister, including two long one-to-one meetings, in the week in which he saw off dramatic attempts to unseat him. I expected to find a bloodied, beleaguered figure. Matthew Parris called him a \"living waxwork\"; Suzanne Moore a \"zombie gurning ... less popular than pig flu\"; and Richard Littlejohn wrote, \"If Gordon was a dog, he'd be put down.\" A friend joked that it would be better to call up the late medium Doris Stokes than attend the interview. But Brown appears bouncy, even if his staff seem a little shell-shocked. Perhaps it's the relief of survival (for the moment), perhaps it's the adrenaline charge of adversity, perhaps it's the fact that the Tories had just made a rare gaffe on public spending, but the prime minister is apparently relaxed, and talks freely on a vast range of subjects, from the recession to his children, foreign policy to Simon Cowell, spin to how much sleep he's getting, even what he might do when he is no longer in charge. Still, what a week. \"Interesting. Challenging. It feels like any other week,\" he says. The shoulders of his jacket hunch up to his enormous ears. Brown may sound sanguine about his current position, but what would it take for him to agree that, in the words of the resigned cabinet minister James Purnell, his \"continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more, not less likely\"? He clearly doesn't consider himself a liability - he laughs uproariously when I tell him this - but if getting less than 16% in an election isn't enough of a message, what would it take? Something that Peter Mandelson said? \"Something that the Guardian said?\" He laughs again, referring to an editorial earlier this month that called on Labour to \"cut him loose\". This most serious of men simply won't take the question seriously. Come on, to whom would he listen? He levels his gaze, deploys his best growl. \"You,\" he jokes. It becomes clear, as his answers to other questions reveal, that it's Brown to whom Brown listens most. His often-repeated mantra, \"I've got a job to do\" sounds empty, but perhaps it isn't: what drives him appears to be this desire to complete a task. \"When things are difficult, you have to be sure of who you are and what you want to achieve,\" he says. \"When people criticise you, you've got to listen to that criticism, and to learn from it, which I've tried to do. But you also have to be sure about what you are in this for.\" And this is in spite of doubts, which he talks about, quietly. \"To be honest, you could walk away from all of this tomorrow.\" (He often says \"you\" to distance himself from the intended \"I\".) \"I'm not interested in what accompanies being in power. It wouldn't worry me if I never returned to any of those places - Downing Street, Chequers. That would not worry me at all. And it would probably be good for my children.\" He sounds almost wistful, as if imagining a life in which he was not compelled by the belief, perhaps instilled by his Presbyterian minister father, who worked seven days a week, that life is all about toil. (He once joked, \"I have seen the future, and it is work.\") Suddenly, Brown's younger son, Fraser, three next month, bursts down some steps and into the garden. \"Come here! Come on!\" Brown shouts. Fraser, spotty with chickenpox, jumps up at his father and shouts something about Power Rangers. \"Ask him about his plants,\" the prime minister suggests, and when I do, Fraser shows me the pots he's growing, including some ripe strawberries. He points to the pond: \"This is for fish, not for swimming.\" Perhaps he could feed a strawberry to the fish? \"No, they don't like strawberries,\" he shouts. \"They like poo! They like poo!\" His father seems familiar with this kind of line: \"He's at the age where everything comes back to ... that.\" His children are cute and John, five, is already at the local state school. I wonder why he doesn't deploy them more to soften his dour public image. \"Sarah perhaps made a decision - and I certainly made a decision - to be in politics, and people are free to criticise Sarah and me. But my children, they didn't make that decision. I'd prefer them to grow up in a modest and ordinary background.\" David Cameron, who is often photographed with his children, has taken a different path. \"Well, each to their own decisions. But I'm clear that although I talk about my children a lot, and clearly I want to do everything to support them, I don't feel they would benefit from being in the public arena.\" Nevertheless, the boundaries between Brown's home and work life seem curiously fluid. The maze of rooms, corridors and staircases in Downing Street, some parts official, some residential, is baffling. In the official areas, you are forever bumping into a racing child. In the flat, where the Browns live, there are staff wandering in and out, old-fashioned fax machines beside homemade Father's Day cards (early, or very late). Alongside the ordinary recycling bins is one that is locked and marked \"Confidential\". You step over toys, and Brown's wife, Sarah, brings tea - but in a Household Cavalry mug. And it's awkward: the flat is more relaxed than the formal areas, but not much; you have to reach it in an absurdly small lift. I was squashed into it with the PM and his special adviser; it was definitely necessary to breathe in. With a job such as his, though, with its all-consuming demands, it must be lovely to work where his children are. \"That's one of the advantages,\" Brown says. So it's a nice place to live? \"You wouldn't choose to live here.\" The layout is confusing. \"Oh, it's ridiculous. I'd be happy enough living in the flat we had before, but I've discovered it's the only way you can do this job, by living here. There'd be huge security issues, the way things are. I wish it was more open.\" Being behind such heavy security must cut him off from the electorate. \"Yes, but I've tried to get around the country more, it's much more interesting ... It's been very difficult to focus on [strategic planning] because you have to deal with immediate events like if a bank's going to go under. It's difficult to be running around the country if you're dealing with that.\" In fact, Brown has a truly innovative idea for how the prime minister should live: \"If you could run No 10 from a train, getting round the country, that would be the best way.\" How does he cope with the stress of the job? Does he stop sleeping? \"I always sleep. But I have one child who hates going to bed, I've got another who gets up really early, and the gap between the two is getting narrower and narrower.\" But he must have ways to find relief from it all? \"You're defining me as someone who feels under real pressure ... Obviously, when something happens that is surprising to you, you've got to respond to it.\" Perhaps he goes for a run? \"That's one of the problems: I'd like to run in London in the morning, but I can't. When I'm in Scotland, I can run. We've got a hill and I can just run up it.\" He was a talented sportsman before he lost the sight in his left eye in a rugby match, and still moves around with astonishing speed, despite an expanding paunch pushing at the buttons of his thick cotton shirt. He has suggested that he doesn't feel under much pressure, but surely the last few weeks have been pretty bad. \"I've been through lots of things before.\" As bad as this? \"Yeah.\" Brown looks severe, and from his expression I guess he might be thinking about personal setbacks, such as his 10-day-old daughter Jennifer's death in 2002, or the six months he was kept immobile in a darkened hospital as a teenager while doctors fought to save his sight. He has wept about Jennifer in interviews before, and I have no desire to get him to talk about the tragedy again: he told Suzie Mackenzie in 2004 that it was a year before he could listen to a piece of music. Has he ever been through anything this bad in his political life? \"Maybe not so much ... I've been through lots of different problems over the last 20-30 years, but this is one that's been more in the public eye. But you stop thinking about who you are and think about what you've got to do.\" No indulgence of the ego allowed. He is, of course, acutely aware of how his remarks might play in the media. For instance, when I ask him to concoct a \"fantasy cabinet\" - to select his dream team from the past or present - he senses a trap: \"But then I'd be in a position of saying that the existing cabinet is not the one I wanted,\" he says, hyper-alert to how the press could use such a story. \"I'll tell the home secretary he's going to be replaced by Gladstone!\" But he is frustrated with the way Westminster is seen. \"Politics is written up as the ins and outs, the infighting and the calculations, as if it's a game, right? Whereas I think of it as a purpose and a mission.\" Surely it's both? \"I know it's both, but if we don't stand united, we just confirm the image the public has of us from the expenses crisis - that we're in it for ourselves, that it's about small ambitions, not big causes. It's the big causes that matter, that drive you on.\" Still, you need people with you to do that. \"You do, you do!\" he agrees. And he himself is known as an expert at political machinations: he once said, when he became rector of Edinburgh University, that \"it was quite a revelation to me to see that politics was less about ideals and more about manoeuvres\". He protests: \"I'm not sure I'm that good at it ... I don't actually think I am very good at it at all.\" Well, he certainly outmanoeuvred the so-called Hotmail plot of Blairite ministers and backbenchers. \"This was the email that nobody signed?\" he jokes. But he claims his background means he finds the shenanigans of politics difficult. \"I never heard my father say a bad word about anyone.\" (He has a coughing fit at this point. \"Water!\" he shouts. \"I'm talking too much!\") He recovers: \"It's incredible ... I wish I could be as good as he was. That's why it was shocking to me that politics could be so personality-driven.\" That may be true, I say, but he has employed other people to do his dirty work. This is a familiar accusation, most recently made by environment minister Jane Kennedy, who resigned, alleging he \"rules by smear\". He responds: \"Look, find weaknesses in me, criticise me for my weaknesses - I'm not as great a presenter of information or communicator as I would like to be - but the one thing people should not say is that I'm surrounded by some group of conspirators.\" What about Damian McBride, Brown's shamed spin doctor, sacked for sending an email suggesting planting scurrilous and untrue rumours about members of the opposition? \"Damian McBride doesn't work for me.\" But he did. \"When Damian McBride made a mistake, he was out. He made a mistake and he had to go.\" But he was notorious for sending abusive texts to journalists. \"I didn't know that. I didn't know that. It's not what I do. Anyway, I don't text. But when that behaviour was discovered: out! Gone! Away! No longer working for me. And I think if you look at the people who work in our office ... it's people who've come from charities, academic life, business ...\" People around Brown say McBride and his predecessor, Charlie Whelan, acted on their own initiative to spin against the Tories; Blairites know they also spun against them. It's hard to believe Brown's insistence that he knew nothing about it; post-Campbell, post-The Thick Of It, spin is hardly a hidden art. What of Caroline Flint's excoriating resignation letter, in which the Europe minister accused Brown of having an inner cabal with few women in it and of using women as \"window dressing\" - did that annoy him? \"It does, because I've tried not only to promote women, but also our egalitarian agenda is an agenda that helps women most of all: the minimum wage, working families tax credit, maternity rights, childcare, new chances in education for people who missed them. The majority of people who benefit are girls and women.\" So why have only four women in the cabinet? \"Well, attending cabinet [there are] a lot more.\" Only three more - of the 33 ministers who are either in cabinet, or able to attend cabinet in some capacity, only seven are women. \"Most of the people promoted to minister of state are women ... But we always need more women at every level.\" Even so, whatever way you look at it, it's not great. \"Obviously, we lost Jacqui [Smith], we lost Hazel [Blears], we lost Caroline [Flint].\" (He makes it sound as if they were lost at sea.) Is he sad about that? \"Of course. They did a good job and I wanted them to stay.\" So why didn't he, say, promote Flint? \"Caroline was minister for Europe and was offered the promotion to be present at all cabinet meetings. Every cabinet. But she wanted to run a particular department.\" Which one? \"I don't know, we didn't get to that conversation. The point is, she'd been in that job for a few months, she was doing very well, Europe is a big job and she's going to be at cabinet. So it wasn't a demotion, it was a promotion.\" Her letter? \"It was sad.\" He uses a similar, it's-all-so-terribly-sad tone the next day, when discussing Blears. \"At some point I think Hazel should come back to government.\" Does he use women as window dressing? \"No. At Downing Street we've got women doing many of the important jobs. You ask all my staff.\" I ask a few. One close female colleague says, \"He just doesn't differentiate between men and women in his conversation. He's just not someone who thinks about it.\" Another says, \"For years he's worked closely with good feminist women like Harriet Harman and she has never complained of anything.\" One talks of his kindness and discretion when she was ill. But a male colleague concedes, \"He is slightly a product of an older generation.\" Brown's intimate relationships with women were for many years kept fanatically secret; he didn't marry until he was 49 and rumours about his sexuality persisted, perhaps because some found it hard to understand that a straight man could have close gay friends (such as Peter Mandelson and Nick Brown). His exes were attractive, intelligent women such as Sheena McDonald, the television presenter, Marion Caldwell, a lawyer, and, most surprisingly, given his rather heavy reputation, Princess Margarita of Romania, Prince Philip's goddaughter, whom he met at university. She said of their relationship: \"It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him, but one day it didn't seem right any more. It was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing.\" Brown married former PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, though he took a long time to commit; in 1995, when they had been seeing each other for 18 months, the journalist Lynn Barber asked him about Sarah and he said, \"No. That's wrong. It's just the way names get thrown up.\" His marriage appears settled and happy, and even those who don't like him like her; she refuses all requests for interviews. Sarah is widely regarded as an electoral asset, but nothing was able to offset an undeniably catastrophic Euro election result. \"Labour voters punished us by not coming out to vote,\" he says, \"but I don't detect an enthusiasm for the Conservative party.\" Brown refuses to accept that the next election is as good as lost. \"I don't believe the Conservatives can win in the way you're suggesting. The Tories have made, for them, a cardinal mistake in that they admitted the truth - that if you take 10% off the health service or schools or policing, you've cut into the jobs, the services, the expectations. The Conservatives' mask has slipped. They cannot be a centre ground party any more, they can't talk about being mainstream. The choice has become a lot clearer.\" But won't everyone have to cut public spending, as governments are forced to tighten their belts to pay off debt built up during the recession? \"No. It's a myth. Public spending will continue to rise. It's in our figures. We've costed it, and you're paying more in top rate tax to pay for it.\" He sees his trials in a global context (perhaps so they seem less to do with him). \"Every government in the world is having trouble. Lula from Brazil told me that when he was a trade unionist and something went wrong, he blamed the government. When he was an opposition leader, he blamed the government. And when he became the government, he blamed the Americans. And now that he can't blame the Americans, he blames the bankers.\" Yes, I say, let's blame the bankers! \"I'm not going to blame anyone else,\" he says, suddenly sombre. So what about Labour's poor showing? Is it all his fault? \"It's easy to find an individual to blame, and make that person the source of the trouble, but we've been hit by a world economic hurricane, by an expenses crisis unparalleled in the history of Westminster, and we've been in government for 12 years.\" But he also gives another reason: \"Of course, unity in the party is an important element to this. People want to see parties united, not divided. All these elements are not present at the moment ...\" In nine months, Brown has gone from being popular - the man who saved Britain from financial meltdown - to a pariah. Has he found it upsetting? \"However much you feel responsible, and however much your integrity is ... is ... and you feel hurt by what people are saying, you've got to deal with it.\" Friends say he can't understand why people have turned against him; that he's the same person he was when he was doing well in the polls. He thinks under his leadership Labour can win the next election, and perhaps because he's seen the tide turn so quickly, he thinks it can turn again. He is sure that, in time, his measures will turn the economy around. And he really believes that the age we're living in is a progressive one. He cites a bit of evidence for this: for the first time, he says, teaching is the most popular occupation for people leaving university. \"It's a great profession. I could move to teaching ... \" He beams, as if to say, You see! There's always something else I can do! Brown is convinced that he is prime minister in a uniquely difficult period. He talks of the \"two earthquakes - one economic, unparalleled since the war, one political, the biggest parliamentary scandal for two centuries\". But it's more even than that: \"The changes throughout the world, whether you talk about the environment, or the nature of jobs, are dramatic. For centuries, individuals have been learning how to live with their neighbours. Now, uniquely, we're having to learn to live with people who we don't know. People have now got the ability to speak to each other across continents, to join with communities that are based not on territory, but on networks; and you've got the possibility of people building alliances right across the world. That flow of information means that foreign policy can never be the same again. You cannot have Rwanda again because information would come out far more quickly and public opinion would grow to the point where action would need to be taken. Foreign policy can no longer be the province of just a few elites.\" Returning to the idea that we live in a \"progressive age\", he believes that the public's fury about MPs' expenses and bankers' pay is proof of this. But if so, and if Labour is the progressive party, why isn't everyone voting for them? \"People are in this difficult position - which I understand - where they know we've made these decisions to try to sort the economy out, but they don't yet see results. Same thing on MPs. People know there's a crisis in MPs' expenses, but they don't yet know we've sorted it out.\" What's the timescale? \"It's going to take some time.\" Will it all be done in time for, say, May (the last date at which Brown can call a general election)? \"In time for whenever,\" he says. (\"She's forcing me to be a politician,\" he says, turning to an aide.) Labour voters stayed at home because they're angry, mainly about MPs' expenses. \"I'm as angry as the public. I understand their moral outrage. I've said it offends my Presbyterian conscience, and it does.\" But, he adds, \"One thing I didn't cause is the expenses crisis.\" He sees a link between expenses and the economy: \"What people took out of the banking crisis is that bankers can act in a way that's irresponsible and unfair, and what people take out of the political crisis is the same thing.\" So, private and public worlds have both shown themselves to be irresponsible. \"The public realm and the free market realm are subject to inherent weaknesses that have got to be underpinned by having shared values that lead to shared rules,\" he says, in some version, many times. Values, values, values, rules, rules, rules. I find this curious. Brown seems keen to show how both private and public sectors have revealed their profound flaws, so he can sort out both together, without making a distinction between the two. If anything, he seems to me almost relieved that it's not just the private sector that has been profligate - a bizarre idea when the expenses scandal has done him such damage. But perhaps it allows him to be all things to all people. Hasn't the banking crisis led him to fall out of love with the unfettered capitalism that many Labour supporters saw him as having embraced, and found so hard to stomach? \"I don't think I was ever ... \" he starts, and doesn't finish. \"I've always argued that this global marketplace has got to be properly supervised. What I didn't want was Britain to be in a position where we were outside the mainstream.\" He seems to be saying that the neoliberal model was simply the only option for Britain if it wanted to be part of the world economy. But did he really need to be such an outrider to the mainstream, pushing things further? \"To be honest, for the last 10 years when I was chancellor, my battles were always with those people who were telling me we should deregulate even more.\" Does he wish he'd been tougher? Regulated more? \"Yeah ... but I was calling on the rest of the world all the time to create a global supervisory regime.\" Perhaps what we need is a return to old-fashioned banking? I give you \u00a31 to look after, you lend out 90p of it to others. \"That kind of banking has been sound,\" he agrees. \"But the international ambitions of these banks made them take risks that nobody could ever have contemplated.\" Couldn't he, as chancellor, have stopped them? \"Well, we didn't know about a lot of it. People did not know that British, German, Italian, Austrian banks were buying subprime mortgages from the States.\" But all that packaging up of assets, selling bits off so no one knows who owns what - that's no way to run a bank. \"But it will continue to happen.\" So there's nothing that can be done? \"No, there's a lot that can be done. But it will still be in the interests of the economy to have many sources of money for investment in the future. But it must be in conditions where you have proper supervision and an understanding through transparency of what's happening.\" He has been criticised over inequality, which under many measures has risen under Labour: that he cares about reducing poverty, yes, but cares little about the vast sums the richest are paid. He concedes that that has been his focus: \"Poverty has fallen, and you'll see it continue to fall over the next year or so. And then there is the issue at the top. I've always said you can deal with some of it through taxation, our tax rates have gone up and the top 1% of the population are paying more than before. Removing people from poverty must be our priority. Whatever you can or can't do at the top - because it's a global economy - you can as a government do a lot with the poor.\" It's almost as if he wants to be a socialist for the poor and a free marketeer for the rich - also known as having your cake and eating it. At first, during our conversations, I thought that Brown had moved away from his New Labour triangulated position - such as when he said, \"Free market solutions can't work. They can't work for the environment, they can't work for the economy.\" But then he added, \"The old market v state debate is not sufficient to solve the problems that we have.\" Despite the scale of the economic crisis, there's no doubt that Brown is still New Labour at heart. Much has changed, though: perhaps most strikingly his relationship with Mandelson, who is widely believed to have saved the prime minister this month and now has more titles than we have space for here. Once close, Brown never forgave Mandelson for backing Tony Blair to be Labour leader when John Smith died in 1994; throughout a decade of New Labour infighting between Blairites and Brownites, they were at war with each other. And now? \"I get on with Peter very well.\" After all those years? \"It's really interesting, isn't it? When there's a common purpose, people tend to work together ... Things go wrong ... \" And now? \"There is a common purpose. I think in a sense people are coming to appreciate his talents in a way the Labour party didn't before.\" Even to love him? (Blair once said his mission would be complete only when the party learned to love Mandelson.) \"They're at least appreciating his talents.\" But not loving him. \"I think there's a great affection for him now, to be honest.\" Another change is his new enthusiasm for reality TV and, just a little, for the celebrity culture he eschewed for so long. This month he ennobled Alan Sugar, businessman star of The Apprentice; Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain's Got Talent, told of how she had been invited to No 10 for dinner (\"Gordon was incredibly charming - it was a side of him you don't see on TV\"); Piers Morgan, her fellow judge, claimed on Desert Island Discs earlier this month that he saw the PM every six weeks or so, and that he talks to Sarah once a week. Meanwhile, Sarah, a confident woman whose work on maternal mortality has had a real impact, has been photographed out with Naomi Campbell, Paris Hilton, Sharon Osbourne. Why ennoble Sir Alan? Brown says he has known Sugar since 1997, and that his new role is to \"get the banks to act in a more open and forward-looking way to new business proposals\". But has Brown ever watched The Apprentice? The man is no sweet-talker. \"People respect the advice he gives them, even if it's harsh sometimes.\" He's also the man who said of women who might have children, \"Just don't employ them.\" \"I'm not here to defend every statement he's made,\" Brown says. And Britain's Got Talent - is it his new favourite TV show? \"I think Britain's Got Talent is really interesting. What annoyed me when I was at school was that there were lots of people with obvious ability who could've benefited from opportunities and were told, 'It's not for people like you.' And now they've got more open ways of coming forward. Surely the future for our country is more that Britain has got talent than it is that Britain is a broken society.\" What about the judges? Simon Cowell is so nasty. \"Do you not think the reason people like him is that he's honest about whether they've got a talent or not?\" This sounds uncannily like why Sugar appeals to him, too. Others see their behaviour as bullying, and, of course, that's what Brown's critics say about him, too. Lord Turnbull called him a \"bully and a control freak\", a sentiment echoed by those who have fallen foul of his relentless demands for loyalty. Close allies are more forgiving, such as the colleague who says, \"Look, it's not the easiest thing to be in a meeting with him. He doesn't mean to intellectually overwhelm you, but he'll always ask you the question you hadn't thought of ... which is very annoying. That doesn't make him empathetic. But so what? Can you imagine being taken through the banking crisis by Cameron or Alan Johnson? It's chilling. Fifty years ago he'd have been FDR. Did anyone ever notice that he had a wheelchair?\" Of course it would be noticed now. Brown would clearly prefer a political era of New Deals and Bretton Woods, rather than rolling news and YouTube. He talks with longing about the days when the BBC would announce, \"There is no news to report.\" He doesn't relish 24-hour news, the constant media demands on politicians, what Sugar (of all people) calls \"the giant reality show this country is driven by\". Brown confesses here that he's \"not as great a presenter of information or communicator as [he] would like to be\" - a dangerous shortcoming when presentation is such an essential skill of the 21st-century politician. This must be particularly frustrating for Brown since he is able to communicate successfully, but more in private, where it is of limited use to him. I witnessed him prepare for a short TV interview and he seemed to rearrange his features into something stiffer and less appealing for the camera. He was asked about Cristiano Ronaldo's \u00a380m transfer deal, a subject surely ripe for a joke, and he muttered something about English football emerging stronger as a result. During all our one-to-one conversations, I never once saw him perform that strange, lower-jaw breathing manoeuvre he so often executes in public. His image is fusty and secretive, but he's the first prime minister to sit in an open-plan office in Downing Street. To me he spoke fluently and with passion. He sounded like a normal person. The prime minister is a man of such paradoxes. He is now convinced free market solutions can't work, but is still privatising parts of the Royal Mail and the health service. He passes strong legislation on women while appointing few to top positions. He sees himself as a good person, but employs others to do his dirty work. He wants to stay as prime minister, but longs to get out of No 10, govern from a train, become a teacher. As he says himself, \"It's a strange life, really.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
