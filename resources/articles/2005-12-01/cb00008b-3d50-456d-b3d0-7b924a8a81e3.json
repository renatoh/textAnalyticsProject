My mum was a nursery school teacher and she'd take me in with her. I was desperate to read, so she took me to the reception teacher for lessons at playtime. I learned with a combination of phonics, look-and-say and recognising the shapes of common words. Every child needs to know phonics, or they can't manage new words, but they also need to work on pattern recognition because 15% of our words don't follow regular spelling rules. I'm not an enormous fan of the way the literacy hour has been imposed, but children coming up from primary school know more about how language works. They definitely aren't reading such demanding books, though. Most of my girls, who are very bright, read books with bright pink covers and that breathy, colloquial chick-lit feel. Neil Johnson Parent, London My parents started me off. I was able to read before I went to school, though I can't remember exactly how it was done. I remember charts with the alphabet on in school and the coloured books you progressed through. I remember getting quite competitive about getting to gold before anyone else. When I was a bit older, I read all the books by Ian Serraillier - there was one with a helicopter on the cover that I liked so much I started it again immediately. When I was about 12, I read The Hobbit in a day. I was taught very traditionally: the letters, the sounds they make, the combinations of the sounds. I also put a lot of store in word recognition and using context, but I think they are complementary to understanding the fundamentals. Hannah Couchman Aged 16, West Midlands I don't think my parents sat me down with the intention of teaching me to read; it was one of those daily processes, seeing the words every day as pictures and starting to recognise them. When I was little, I had all the usual picture books and when you read them over and over again you begin to understand what the words mean. In school, we learned phonetically. You need a combination of the two because for some words, like plough, phonetics don't work. In school, we had a series of storybooks based on The Village with Three Corners, and they were so boring. The one about Billy Blue-hat became known as Billy Bloody Blue-hat in our house. I'm doing English AS-level and my set books are Emma, Much Ado About Nothing, the Canterbury Tales and A Streetcar Named Desire. Outside school I read really awful chick-lit, entirely unacademic and embarrassing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
