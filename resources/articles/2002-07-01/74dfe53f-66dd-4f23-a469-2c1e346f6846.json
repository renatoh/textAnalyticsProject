By half time yesterday he had sold 30 of them. \"I'm not tempting fate,\" he said, in a busy crowd on Copacabana beach. \"We'll win this game no problem.\" His Brazilian sense of self-belief was not mistaken. Minutes after the final whistle blew he had sold out. \"Brazzzziiiiiiiiiil,\" he shouted, with everyone else. \"Brazzzziiiiiiiiiil, Penta-Campeao.\" Rio's happiness was reflected in a beautiful winter's day. By 8am, the local time of the kick-off, it was already about 25C (77F). Drummers from the Salgueiro samba school were providing the background noise and most were having a breakfast of ice-cold beers. Two German tourists, Flo Fruhauf and Michi Freyman, decked out in black, red and white, were seemingly the only people not wearing bright yellow. \"We will win for sure,\" said Flo, who almost could not be heard above a chorus of boos. After Ronaldo scored his first goal in the 67th minute, the started jumping and screaming and never really stopped. Copacabana is a little like Bournemouth - it has one of the oldest average ages of any district in Brazil and the musclemen are almost outnumbered by women like bleached-blonde Gloria Alves, 52, who had dressed up her poodle in yellow and green ribbons. \"I am so proud of being Brazilian,\" she said. \"My happiness is immense.\" After the game, President Fernando Henrique paid tribute to the team: \"The tears of Ronaldo and Scolari are tears of the Brazilian people, who are moved with the victory.\" On television, several pundits made clear that politicians should not be making mileage from the exploits of the footballers. Brazil holds a presidential election in October. \"In an election year, we need to remember that this is a victory for football and the Brazilian people, not for politicians and football's [corrupt] bosses,\" said Oscar, who played in the 1982 World Cup. Emerson Leao, who was coach until a year ago, went further in his criticism: \"Winning with our football players is easy, what is difficult is winning with the football bosses we have.\" But the voices of caution could not dampen a joyous day. Even the German tourists were happy. At the final whistle one was deep in an embrace with a Brazilian in hotpants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
