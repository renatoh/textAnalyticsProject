Sometime the best accounts come from the mouths of ordinary people who've been at the sharp end of extraordinary events. Like the undocumented Latino workers who did 25% of the reconstruction work after Hurricane Katrina hit the US Gulf Coast in August 2005, only to find the authorities turn their back on them afterwards. Polo, a 23-year-old Mexican, worked seven days a week clearing up after Katrina, sleeping in a guarded air hangar, then was told at gunpoint to leave by soldiers who said his employers had left town without paying him. \"My idea was to get to Mississippi, to start working, and to earn money to send to my family,\" Polo says in a new collection of interviews with undocumented workers in the United States. \"I couldn't imagine this kind of humiliation.\" Underground America is the latest in an oral history series published by the San-Francisco-based Voice of Witness project, started by author Dave Eggers. \"(This) is not a compendium of suffering. This is a collection of voices,\" insists editor Peter Orner, who's an asylum lawyer and a fiction writer. The book focuses on undocumented workers from all around the world trying to make it in the United States - most of them separated from their families for years on end. Many suffer violence and injuries or end up doing forced labour, but few complain or seek medical attention because of the constant fear of deportation. Most manage to send money home to their families, even when they're working two jobs to make ends meet, barely eating or sleeping and going without any social life. It seems it's only possible for the next generation to move beyond a subsistence-level existence of work and sleep, and even then it's a struggle. Polo's story represents thousands of others. Some 100,000 Latino workers relocated to the Gulf Coast after Katrina, and one in three of the undocumented reconstruction workers reported trouble getting paid for their work, according to a study by the Human Rights Centre at the University of California, Berkeley. A month after the disaster - one of the worst in American history - US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it sent 725 officers to the Gulf to detain and remove undocumented workers. \"The point of the series is to illuminate human rights abuses through oral history,\" said Eggers, still best known for his first book, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, about his struggle as a young man to bring up his little brother after their parents had died of cancer. In a time when history is told in cheap television re-enactments, if at all, and personal tragedy is gobbled up in rapidly digestible magazine photos and reality shows, this project goes against the grain. You could say this is a kind of journalism, but it's not about finding the soundbite to represent the person. And it's not about getting a good story out quickly. Eggers, speaking as a journalist, says: \"We take something, then we leave. It's a transaction fraught with problems.\" If the journalist misinterprets something, there's nothing you can do. He sees an oral history project, on the other hand, as a partnership between the people telling their stories and the people transmitting them to the reader. Eggers has written both fiction and non-fiction, and started a publishing house, McSweeney's. He's also co-founder of 826 Valencia, a San Francisco neighbourhood project to boost children's writing skills, based behind a pirate-themed shop where you can buy eye patches, read about swabbing decks, and buy mutiny-themed soap. But this oral history project is not a one-man Eggers show. A panel of highly respected contemporary historians, activists, academics and novelists is involved, as well as dozens of volunteers. It doesn't have a budget, and it's never had any funding. \"We don't have a dime,\" Eggers said. The first book in the series was Surviving Justice, accounts of exonerated prisoners who were wrongfully convicted. It was followed by Voices from the Storm, the collection of Hurricane Katrina survivors' voices. But Eggers hadn't meant the focus to be on the United States. The idea started with Sudan, when he was working with Valentino Achak Deng, a refugee whose story Eggers turned into the novel What Is the What. He had collected tens of thousands of words from Achak Deng about escaping war in south Sudan as a child and spending years on the road and in camps in Africa. He knew what a difference it made to have spent those hours together and worked on understanding what had really happened. That novel, and his first book, were intricate and highly intelligent exercises in carving the facts into finely wrought literature. These oral history books are something totally different. They start at the beginning and end as close to the present as possible, in the exact words of the people who have experienced these huge injustices. The editors might cut and re-order the conversation, and they'll include notes to explain any background the reader might need to catch up with the story, but the narrator is the person who lived - and still lives - the events, not the historian. Without any oral history training, Eggers got help from the American granddaddy of the genre, Studs Terkel. He learned about the dangers of retraumatising interviewees, learnt how to order questions. The Voice of Witness team decided they wouldn't publish anything without the narrators' approval, the interviewees could make changes afterwards if they wanted, and would have access to as many books as they liked. But they did check each person's story, and go back to them with any anomalies they uncovered. Each book includes voices beyond the type of people we've come to expect. So the exonerated prisoners aren't all downtrodden working class men, framed by police or let down by bad lawyers. It includes a 59-year-old white woman, who, just like the others, illustrates how easy it is for the US justice system to go completely off track. The tales don't end with getting out of prison. In fact, many of the narrators say the hardest part is afterwards, living without compensation and having lost decades of life, struggling to find a place in a society that stigmatises them for having been in jail. The Katrina stories include a black prisoner, and a grandmother who floated her grandchildren in buckets through miles of filthy floodwater looking for help, but it also tells the story of a Vietnamese priest who stayed behind with parishioners who could not evacuate. And this latest collection isn't just about downtrodden Latino farmworkers, although they're included too. It's got stories of a 10-month-long trip from China via Thailand, Cuba and Mexico, and a South African who thought she was coming as a missionary but found herself trapped as a servant to a pastor's family. Underground America's editors chose to use the description \"undocumented\" because it sounds more dignified than \"illegal\". But, the book's editor, Orner, says in his introduction: \"Of course they have documents: family photos, diplomas, driver's licences, love letters, emails, credit card bills, tax forms, homework, children's drawings.\" The next Voice of Witness book, promised soon, is Out of Exile, with stories from the north-south war that ended in 2005, some from people who spent years in slavery after being abducted, and others from the war-torn western region of Darfur. In Undocumented America, published by McSweeney's, Roberto from Mexico says after years doing brutally hard and dangerous agricultural work: \"I tell myself, those who haven't fallen don't know how to walk. I guess I've fallen so many times now, I should be able to walk forever.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
