It might be an amazing view, or a memorable moment at a festival; it might be a new friend, or a photo of you feeling depressed about - or even celebrating - the World Cup; it could be the mourners at your dog's funeral; whatever was special for you. Please send your photo - in digital or print form - along with a brief caption (no more than 100 words) to arrive by Wednesday, December 20. We will select the best and run them in a G2 special issue on December 29. Email digital photographs (as a jpeg) to my.photo@theguardian.com. Send prints to Myphoto, Guardian features dept, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1 3ER. Please include full contact details with all entries. Unfortunately we will not be able to return your prints."}, "isHosted": false}}}
