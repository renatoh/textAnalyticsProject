Arsenal travel to Manchester United on Saturday evening in the sixth round of the Cup and trail Sir Alex Ferguson's side in the league by three points, having played a match fewer. \"We have got great mental strength,\" said Wilshere. \"There is disappointment in the dressing room, yes, but we have got to pick ourselves up and go to Manchester United to get the win. It is massive. We are still in two competitions, just three points behind United in the league and with a game in hand. Maybe now that we are out of Europe, we can be stronger in the league, concentrate on that more, and really push on to try to win it.\" United, who stand at 0-0 with Marseille before their own Champions League last-16 deciding leg next week, are still on course to repeat their 1999 treble of Premier League, European Cup and FA Cup. Wilshere believes Ferguson may tinker with his side on Saturday to conserve resources for these challenges. \"We know United are a great team, but they have a European game next week, so they might play a weakened side, then we can go there and take advantage of that,\" he said. \"We need to be strong to push on and make sure we get a trophy at the end of the year.\" Arsenal lost 1-0 at United in the league earlier in the season but Wilshere believes his side should have won. \"We could have beaten them,\" he said. \"We will be going there to win [on Saturday], and that's what we will do. United still have to come to our place [on 1 May in the league]. We are going to take the game to them there and really push on hard in the league now. We want to win every game. When they come to us, we want to be in front of them. Hopefully we will be.\" Arsenal have now been eliminated from the Champions League in consecutive seasons by Barcelona and Wilshere claimed the latest defeat will be an invaluable lesson. \"We are going to learn a lot,\" the 19-year-old said. \"We know we have got good mental strength and have to bounce back now. We know we have got great character. We showed that in the first leg, when we came from behind at home against Barcelona. Now we just have to bounce back and go to Manchester and get a win.\" Wilshere's team-mate, Bacary Sagna, claimed that although Arsenal did not record a single shot on target at the Camp Nou the sides were close and that Robin van Persie's 56th-minute sending-off by Massimo Busacca altered the match. The striker received a second yellow for playing on after the referee blew for offside. \"There's not a big gap between the teams,\" Sagna said. \"They had a lot of possession but like last year we conceded at a bad time. We let in a goal just before half-time [Lionel Messi's first] and that was tough to take. We were frustrated because again we had a problem with the referee because of his reaction against Robin. It changed the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
