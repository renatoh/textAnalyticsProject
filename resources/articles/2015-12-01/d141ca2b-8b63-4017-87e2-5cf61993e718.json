The remarkable success being enjoyed by Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team means the almost equally impressive progress being made by Palace, and indeed Stoke, is under less of a potentially off-putting spotlight. It also emphasised that, as Pardew and Mark Hughes both suggested, there really has been an encouraging reduction in the size of the gap between the so-called big clubs and the rest. \u201cBefore the start of the season I certainly said, and I know Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and a couple of managers said, the quality coming into teams like us and Stoke \u2013 I look at the technical quality in Stoke and but for a couple of results it could be them in this position, they\u2019re a great team \u2013 means we really are not far away from the top teams and it\u2019s making for some fantastic games,\u201d said Pardew. \u201cWe were all beginning to worry three or four years ago that it looked like the gap was only going to get bigger. It hasn\u2019t, and for all the money that\u2019s being spent, we\u2019re getting the quality of 11 players on the pitch that are not too far away from some of the top teams. The top teams are probably more concerned than they\u2019ve been for a long time. Good.\u201d Amen to that, though Hughes, understandably perhaps after seeing his team undone by a brilliant 30-yard effort from the Palace substitute Lee Chung-yong, a side-foot shot that curled at pace across and beyond the City goalkeeper Jack Butland just a couple of minutes from time, was a little more cautious. \u201cThis year isn\u2019t a one-off, it would be more prevalent in years to come and I think maybe there has been a changing of the guard somewhat,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe middle group has got stronger, there are only so many players that top clubs can really bring into their squad to make them better. The ones with the most resources will invariably filter their way back up to the top but it\u2019s good that you see fresher faces and it makes it more interesting. Hopefully we\u2019ll be in the mix towards the end as well.\u201d On this evidence the likelihood is Stoke will, along with a Palace side watched by the new American investors who will hopefully make them permanent members of the Premier League\u2019s upper echelons. While Bojan Krkic, Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri got rather less change out of the Palace defenders than they did out of the Manchester City defenders a fortnight earlier, Stoke still enjoyed much the greater share of possession, and created many more chances than a Palace team missing the playmaker Yohan Cabaye. They could not beat Palace\u2019s in-form goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, though, and an exchange of penalties \u2013 Palace\u2019s nailed on, Glenn Whelan clearly fouling Wilfried Zaha, Stoke\u2019s less so, a debatable handball against Damien Delaney \u2013 looked to have ensured a division of the spoils before Lee\u2019s technically outstanding late strike. The Palace defender Scott Dann, up there with Hennessey as contender for the man of match, echoed his manager\u2019s sentiments. \u201cI think there are a lot of teams around there. Leicester are top of the league, then we have West Ham, ourselves, there are not many points between them and it\u2019s all up for grabs. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t be up there and trying to push on as far as we can.\u201d Palace travel to Bournemouth on Boxing Day, while Stoke welcome Manchester United. Hughes was sanguine about the prospects of facing his stagnating former club. \u201cWe\u2019ll look forward to it. Confidence-wise we\u2019re not damaged by the performance against Palace, though the result is obviously a disappointment. but we\u2019ll look ahead to the United game. At the moment it seems like they\u2019re not in great shape so it might be a good time to play them.\u201d Man of the match Wayne Hennessey (Crystal Palace)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
