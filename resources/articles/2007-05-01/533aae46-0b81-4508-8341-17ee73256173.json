Store executives have written to 26,000 employees in its final salary pension scheme warning they are at risk if the data is accessed by criminals. BBC Radio 4 said salary details, addresses, dates of birth, national insurance and telephone numbers were on the machine, which was stolen from a printing firm. The laptop was taken on 18 April during the burglary of a printing firm that had been given the computer so that it could process letters to M&amp;S employees about pension changes. It is believed the machine was taken in an opportunist theft and stolen for its own value, rather than for the information on it. M&amp;S is offering free credit checks to employees who are affected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
