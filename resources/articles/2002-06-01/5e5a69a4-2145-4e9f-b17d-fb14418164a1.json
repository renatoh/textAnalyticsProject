West Indies, chasing a target of 474, were bowled out for 269 in their second innings with 10 overs remaining. The New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond took five for 78, including the wickets of the top scorers Chris Gayle and Brian Lara, who both made 73. New Zealand, who had failed to win in their 11 previous Test matches in the West Indies, were amply rewarded for two patiently constructed innings on a difficult and variable wicket. The tourists, who made 337 and 243 in their two innings, had taken charge by dismissing West Indies for 107 on Saturday when no fewer than eight wickets fell to catches from rash attacking shots. The home batsmen tried to make amends yesterday but the challenge proved beyond them on a deteriorating wicket. The left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori exploited the pitch and took three wickets for 53 runs from 19 overs. \u00b7Australia's one-day captain Ricky Ponting is the latest high-profile sportsman to have suffered a fractured metatarsal bone. Yesterday he entered hospital for surgery but he is expected to be fit for the series against Pakistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
