Comments are open on our series recap blog. We begin where we left off: with Offred \u2013 or June, as she is becoming once more \u2013 being bundled, pregnant, into a van and driven away. Into the darkness within, or else the light; we don\u2019t \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t \u2013 know. Light is streaming through a metal grille when a viewing hatch is opened, but it is slammed shut again. Audible clues offer no comfort: shouting, dogs barking. On the soundtrack \u2013 used sparingly and so effectively \u2013 is the signature falling glissando of doom. The hope drains from June\u2019s eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1,000 words. It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising. June is pulled out by guards with snarling dogs. She \u2013 and the other handmaids \u2013 are muzzled and herded along a tunnel. What hell is this where the dogs are not muzzled, but women are? Well, Gilead. Fenway Park, to be specific, home to the Boston Red Sox; a place of recreation in happier times. Now? A place of execution. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, Guinea in 2009, Chile after Pinochet\u2019s coup in 1973 ... the death knell resonates with reality and with history. A massive scaffold has been erected and a row of nooses are lined up. One is placed over each handmaid\u2019s head, as This Woman\u2019s Work by Kate Bush is played. It is one of those moments in this show that somehow manage to find beauty in the darkest trauma. It turns out to be a mock execution, a lesson to be learned. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd on song) shows up with her interpretation of the Christian message and her instruction to love God. \u201cWalk with him and fear him and cleave unto him and you shall obey his word and the word of his servants here on Earth.\u201d Finally, June speaks, offering her own prayer \u2013 in her head, at least. \u201cOur Father, who art in heaven. Seriously? What the actual fuck!\u201d It is a moment to gasp for air \u2013 of levity, even \u2013 and a reminder that humanity still exists. Because the opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach. And that is not the end of it. After the first flashback, to a decision by June and Luke to try for a second child, it is straight back to the nightmare of the present. Aunt Lydia has the handmaids kneeling in the rain, holding rocks out in front as punishment for refusing to stone Janine to death. Filmed from above, it is more beautifully choreographed horror. Janine, incidentally, is on her way to the Colonies. We \u2013 the series \u2013 will be going, too. And further back, before Gilead, to see how it came about. The first flashback is not all about love and the joy of further procreation. There are warning signs of what is to come. Taking the pill is not a woman\u2019s decision; Luke has to sign off on it. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says, casually, before signing. Next time \u2013 if they had not decided to stop \u2013 he would probably have said nothing and signed. There it is, the creeping normalisation. In the next flashback, June is getting a hard time for not picking up her daughter from school the moment she felt ill \u2026 for having a job, basically; abandoning her child and her duties for her selfish pursuits. In the final flashback, it has begun to kick off: shooting from the gallery in the Capitol building, an explosion in the White House. You are left wondering just how big a leap it is from the Handmaid\u2019s Tale flashbacks to the actual present. It may have been best to leave the show at one season, with Margaret Atwood, open-ended, a hint of better things to come. And with no chance of it becoming diluted or losing the plot. But that was never going to happen \u2013 successful doesn\u2019t walk away from an audience. This is next best, exploring not only forward, but backwards, looking at how it came about. No dilution or loss of plot yet, in an extraordinary first episode that will ring on in your nightmares like Aunt Lydia\u2019s bell. Also, think about what has happened since the first series: #MeToo, mass shootings, you-know-who still in the White House, an abortion referendum in Ireland this week \u2026 dong, dong, dong, dong. It is not just Aunt Lydia\u2019s bell that continues to chime. While The Handmaid\u2019s Tale continues to be relevant, it needs to be told.
