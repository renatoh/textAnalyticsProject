The Dutch firm, still best known for consumer electronics, had skirted around bankruptcy in the mid-1990s after a series of strategic blunders but recovered ground later in the decade. Then the dotcom bubble burst and the business, which was a leading player in semiconductors, went back into a downwards spiral. \"From a number of dimensions, 2000 had been a record year,\" Kleisterlee recalls, in heavily Dutch-inflected English. \"2001 and 2002 were also record years but in reverse order,\" he says with a quiet laugh. \"Then of course with the impairments and the write-downs on acquisitions we had done, we reported two years in a row, the biggest net income loss in the history of the company. That was my start. But from there on, it can only get better.\" Philips, which began as a lightbulb manufacturer in Eindhoven in 1891, has an illustrious past and has been behind some of the most significant advances in consumer technology. It brought to market the first rotary-head shaver in the 1930s and is still widely known for its Philishave brand. It introduced the first cassette tape; in 1972 launched the first video recorder, and in 1982 introduced the compact disc with Sony. The firm also played a pivotal role in developing the DVD and still gets a royalty for each disc and DVD player sold. But in recent decades, the unwieldy company has struggled to increase its revenues, along the way exiting markets including computers and recorded music with the sale of Polygram. It has also often failed to translate its world-beating technology into a commanding position in the market. \"We initially had a good share of the CD market, but then we moved down the path of CD interactive for example, which was basically a precursor to CD rewriteable or Playstation,\" Kleisterlee offers. \"Great technology, maybe too early, or not well positioned. So CD interactive never really made it into the marketplace as a successful application, even if the interactivity was a breakthrough in technology. That is an example of where we had the greatest technology but we were not able necessarily to turn it into the greatest market success,\" he says. When Kleisterlee, who trained as an engineer, began running the business, he embarked on the latest of many overhauls. Investors had become so used to Philips reshaping itself that it had become a \"restructuring play\", he says. In a phrase that might ring familiar to workers at the BBC, he told the management board in his first big meeting as chief executive that they were \"too old, too male, too Dutch\". Today, he says, \"I am the only Dutchman on the management board. I have a French chief financial officer, a German who does innovation and countries for me, an Italian is running lifestyle, an American is running healthcare and a Belgian is running lighting.\" The most significant decision was to sell the semiconductors business. The disposal met two aims. Kleisterlee, 63, wanted to unlock Philips from the highly cyclical semiconductors business and also to move further from components to finished products. He also quickly got out of making mobile phones, a disastrous foray by his predecessor, and now licenses the brand. Battles At the time, Kleisterlee says the business still regarded itself as a high-volume consumer electronics company. But much of that space has now been ceded to manufacturers from Asia and emerging markets, while margins have shrunk. \"We are picking our battles more and more.\" The company, he says, had hardly made a profit in televisions in the United States for 50 years, and now licenses its brand there, focusing instead on Europe and Latin America. The company has been refocused around three areas: consumer lifestyle, which includes televisions, shavers and electric toothbrushes; lighting, where it remains a world leader and sees growth in LED energy-saving bulbs; and healthcare, where it makes products such as CT scanners and home defibrillators. After nearly a decade of restructuring, the company has gone from 189,000 people and sales of \u20ac32bn, to 116,000 and sales of \u20ac23bn. Consumer remains the biggest part of the business but is also the part of the group that has struggled the most during the recession. It is healthcare, competing against Siemens and General Electric, where the company clearly sees the biggest potential for growth, with an ageing population in most developed markets and relatively high margins. Philips has spent \u20ac10bn on acquisitions in the past few years, much in healthcare, including its largest to date, the $5bn takeover of Respironics in 2007, a firm that treats sleep apnoea (a condition that causes people to stop breathing during the night). Kleisterlee struggles to make sense of the three divisions, talking broadly about how they all touch the consumer, and about health and wellbeing, before admitting that one can spend too much in \"intellectual rationalisation\", and that he might be happy with what is \"just a nice portfolio\". Among other changes, he also placed a stronger emphasis on marketing, appointing a chief marketing officer, in the hope that the business might strengthen its branding and better translate its technology into market share. The slogan \u2013 sense and simplicity, which surely owes something to Jane Austen \u2013 was introduced in 2005. Kleisterlee, an imposing business-like presence with ice-blue eyes, has much invested in making a success of the company. Not only did he join straight from national service, but his father had spent his entire career at Philips before him. Working for a large corporation, he says, gives you ample opportunities \u2013 he has worked in manufacturing, sales and run the business in Taiwan and China. But in interviews, he also points out that in post-war Europe, the emphasis was on getting a steady job for life. Doubling profits The headquarters of the business moved from Eindhoven in 2001, and remains in a small cluster of towers in Amstel, a quiet suburb of Amsterdam. It is not yet clear whether the latest reinvention of Philips has paid off. After getting the portfolio into the shape he wanted, Kleisterlee set targets to get the business growing again. Then came the global recession, and the target of doubling profits by 2010 was abandoned. In 2009, sales were down 11% year on year \u2013 its lighting division depends heavily on the construction market, while consumer electronics was hit by the slump in consumer demand. Kleisterlee talks perhaps less with exasperation than as someone used to things not going as planned. \"We set a few goals for ourselves, and then comes the crisis, and we said, God, we were getting in shape and now comes the crisis and we can't show [the improvement].\" The share price in the past year has risen from \u20ac15.59 to \u20ac25.33, but still trades below the level when he started. But he compares Philips' performance in this recession with the years after he joined and finds grounds for optimism. While Philips plunged into the red after the tech bubble burst, it still achieved profit of \u20ac424m last year in a far harsher environment. Could the firm be ready to grow after decades of stagnation? \"I definitely have that feeling; of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You have to unlearn a lot of things in a company that has been focused on risk containment, because so many things went wrong over past decades that almost the institutional instinct, the Pavlovian reaction, is always to focus on the downside. You have to create a culture where people are motivated to go for the upside.
