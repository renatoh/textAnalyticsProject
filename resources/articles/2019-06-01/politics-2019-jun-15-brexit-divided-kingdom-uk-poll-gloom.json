Grand, impressive, prestigious. A split rumbles within the room \u2013 a focus group of older Leave voters from greater London. Perhaps a Jaguar might better represent the country, suggests someone. A debate is had on what car Britain would like to be and what car it actually is. At the moment, sighs another attendee, Britain is a dinky Ford Fiesta. Beerman bristles. A manicurist from Potters Bar who lives with her husband of 22 years, Beerman is one of the 58% of Leave voters who feels optimistic about the future. She is a homeowner with an active social life, her adult children are settled and, despite a pervasive sense of Brexit fatigue, she is content. \u201cWe have security since we downsized, I have a stable marriage, which is important, and as it stands at the moment I feel very confident Brexit will go ahead in October,\u201d she says brightly. All of her friends are \u201con the same page\u201d, given that politics now \u201calways comes up\u201d at dinners and gatherings with friends. \u201cWe don\u2019t want an extension, and if we leave with no deal, so be it, that would be fine. We can work through things once we\u2019ve come out.\u201d But findings from the thinktank BritainThinks, polling more than 2,000 adults across the UK, reveal a starkly despondent national mood; 69% of adults feel pessimistic about national unity and 72% believe that, within a year, Britain will become more divided than it already is. Only 20% of Remain voters feel very or fairly hopeful about the UK\u2019s future. Dean Stevens, a 49-year-old warehouse supervisor from Leicester, lays the blame squarely at the feet of politicians. \u201cWe were a United Kingdom, but we\u2019re a divided kingdom now. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way out of the doom and gloom that isn\u2019t terrible. You see playground antics from the people you\u2019ve elected \u2013 they\u2019ve fuelled a fire in people, made it tribal and everyone\u2019s out for themselves. There\u2019s more deceit in politics now than there has ever been.\u201d Stevens lives with his fiancee and their two 15-year-old boys, and is Leicester born and raised. In December the confectionery factory he works in will close and move to York. \u201cI have no job security. Economically, things are worse. I\u2019m pretty much earning the same wage I was earning 10 years ago: there haven\u2019t been any raises.\u201d The rising cost of living worries him. His son asking for \u201c\u00a3160 trainers\u201d appals him. Stevens mourns the lack of community and closure of pubs in his local area, but won\u2019t go into town because he feels it has become too violent; two of his friends have been mugged there in the past couple of months. According to the survey, anxiety about crime has rocketed up the agenda. One in five adults say it\u2019s likely they or someone they are close to will be a victim of crime in the next year or so; this rises to 29% of those living in London. Homelessness and poverty also rank high; almost 70% of the public feel worried about both. Like almost three-quarters of the UK, and 82% of those aged 65 and over, Stevens and Beerman feel an acute sense of national decline and an erosion of British values \u2013 defined as \u201crespect, manners, pride\u201d. Beerman is bitter about the role she feels immigration has had to play in this. \u201cWithout sounding prejudiced, we have so many immigrants taking advantage of the NHS, so many come here not to work and live off benefits.\u201d That the NHS might have ceased to exist without its immigrant workforce is not an argument that persuades her. The subject remains sore within the focus groups. In London, Simon Liu, 40, believes a lack of integration from immigrants has led to a loss of community. \u201c[They] need to integrate, otherwise there will be more problems\u201d. His parents are Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong and he describes himself \u201cas obviously not ethnically British\u201d, but still proudly feels \u201cingrained\u201d in British society: \u201cI am British absolutely, it\u2019s part of me.\u201d The split between those who identify as \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d stands at 52% to 48%, with the young and those from lower socioeconomic grades far more likely to count themselves in the latter. Voters are no longer simply cynical and apathetic, but are actively engaged in politics \u2013 40% say more so since Brexit, rising to 50% of 18-to-24-year-olds. Yet the majority of Britons have lost faith in the entire political system: three-quarters of the public believe that Britain\u2019s political system is not fit for purpose and that the country is an international laughing stock. Only a fifth believe the next prime minister will be up to the job. Carlo Robbie, 32, who lives and works in east London, says \u201cthe expenses scandal didn\u2019t change the way I viewed politicians necessarily\u201d, but that the current political crisis has had him in utter despair. \u201cI got very emotionally involved and had to take steps to find a way to detach from it.\u201d He is now retraining to become a psychotherapist and does regular volunteer work. Like 72% of those polled, he does not believe that politicians understand the British public. \u201cAny solution has to come from the middle: it can\u2019t come from the far right or the far left because it won\u2019t unify the country. Somehow the majority in the middle needs to be heard above all the name-calling rhetoric about Remoaners and Leavers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
