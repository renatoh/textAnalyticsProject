Hamilton has already had four victories in successive races this season but has now fallen 22 points behind his Mercedes team-mate, Nico Rosberg, after being beaten in Monaco and Montreal. On the eve of Sunday\u2019s Austrian Grand Prix he said: \u201dI\u2019ve just watched M\u00e1rquez win seven in a row in MotoGP. That\u2019s inspired me. I thought, \u2018Jesus, I\u2019ve got to do that. That\u2019s my goal now.\u2019\u201d Hamilton has been the dominant Mercedes driver this year but has been badly damaged by two failures to finish that were beyond his control. He added: \u201cLeading a race is easier than chasing because you\u2019ve got clean air and you manage it a bit better. \u201cBut in terms of points there is more pressure when you\u2019re chasing. You can be affected by a pit stop, a car not finishing, a puncture, and then that gap slips another certain amount of points. It\u2019s harder chasing.\u201d With Mercedes already 119 points ahead in the constructors\u2019 championship it is likely to be only be a short time before they wrap up that title. But Hamilton does not feel he and Rosberg can become more cut-throat with each other and even risk taking each other out when they win the championship. \u201cI think it will be the same,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the team will want to win every race, regardless of the constructors\u2019 title. We want to show that this is a car that can do as the McLaren car did a few years ago.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
