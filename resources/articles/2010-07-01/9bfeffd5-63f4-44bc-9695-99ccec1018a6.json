One of the extensive family of Compositae, its long, tapering and shapely buds suggest an even better show than the common dandelion \u2013 but in general the flower doesn't live up to its youthful promise, lasting only a short time. The fruiting \"clock\" that follows, though, rather puts the dandelion in the shade, being large and spherical and formed of beaked achenes. A habit of the goat's-beard is to close around midday, earning it the old country names of Sleep-at-noon and Jack-go-to-bed-at-noon. Climbing a steep lane immediately below the long gritstone escarpment of Stanage Edge the other day we had a quite different experience of wayside life. A proud mother pheasant (rather unusual on the open moor) led her new family across the asphalt immediately in front of us. There must have been eight or 10 tiny striped balls of fluff following mama in line astern, chicks no more than a couple of days old to look at them. Up there at the edge of the heathery waste this new family must surely be open to risks less common in territory usually occupied by pheasants. They will be easy prey for any lurking Reynard or swooping crow; this mother's fecundity means she'll have her hands full day and night for several weeks until her babes are sufficiently large to fend for themselves. As we came up to the crest of nearby Carrhead Rocks, a tumble of gritstone boulders with a spectacular view across the Hope Valley, the profusion of burgeoning bracken among the heaped stones reminded me that here, beneath the waving green fronds, the chicks could have a sporting chance of avoiding their predators."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
