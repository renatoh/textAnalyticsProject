It is interesting to speculate on what he would be doing now if Live Aid had never happened. While hardly a legendary body of work, the Boomtown Rats' music was certainly popular enough to ensure a long-lived fan base. Geldof might well have ended up exactly where he is: a moderately successful rock musician with a pretty good comeback album headlining a regional jazz and blues festival. He wouldn't, however, also happen to be one of the most famous people on the planet. Geldof's appearance in Nantwich caused quite a commotion, although the party only really got started when he and his band took a break from flogging the new album and whipped through a couple of old Rats songs. If Geldof was wounded by the indifferent reaction to his intensely personal new material, he did his best not to show it. Yet as the sweeping piano introduction to I Don't Like Mondays rang out, he paced back and forth and rubbed his face anxiously, as if girding himself up for the frightful transformation from confessional artist into performing monkey. Fortunately, this wasn't the last we had heard from the Sex, Age and Death album. Despite being drenched in homely sounding fiddles and accordions, Geldof's harrowing tales of his post-Paula Yates existence were allowed to surge cathartically in a manner that evoked the wounded heroism of Neil Young. Pale White Girls had an elegiac quality, but Inside Your Head sounded like a brutal outtake from John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band album, all spitting vitriol and rampant self-pity. Physically, Geldof is a mass of contradictions. Scruffily elegant, he has the weary grace of an ex-Rolling Stone, and the face of an earnest, teenaged singer-songwriter. He can do angst and introspection as convincingly as louche rock-star posturing, and the overall impression is of an immensely confident performer with an uncontrollably troubled heart. It is the perfect recipe for a triumphant comeback, as long as the incessant shouts for Rat Trap don't make him lose his temper."}, "isHosted": false}}}
