The visiting coach's assessment was in marked contrast to Fabio Capello's more guarded concession that his team could now be considered \"contenders\" on an evening tarnished only by John Terry's claim that the Croat substitute, the new Bolton forward Ivan Klasnic, had spat in his face on the final whistle. Bilic denied all knowledge of that incident, but departed with nothing but admiration for England. \u2022 In pictures: England's path to South Africa \u2022 Our guide to buying World Cup tickets \u2022 Paul Hayward: Fabio Capello has transformed England \u2022 Richard Williams: Lennon performed Walcott's role with aplomb \"We didn't expect such a crushing defeat,\" said the former West Ham defender. \"Not in our worst nightmares were we expecting this. It was not a normal defeat. It was humiliation. They played fantastically from the start. Even before the first goal, they looked the sharper, more aggressive side. Simply the better side. We were very happy at half-time that it was only 2-0 because, without our goalkeeper, it could have been five. Our goalkeeper was brilliant. But, in the end, they destroyed us. \"They can definitely win the World Cup. Definitely. It's not easy to play every game like that, but they did not misplace a pass in the first half-hour. All their passes were dangerous, one-twos \u2026 perfect. If they play like that, then of course they can win it.\" Capello, who hailed England's display as the \"best performance\" of his reign, described that opening period as \"the best 20 minutes we have played in the qualification games\". \"We were fantastic, passing the ball quickly and the quality was very, very good,\" he said. \"The first target has been reached. We had to get to South Africa, and now we have time to prepare for the World Cup. We have time and, if everyone is fit, why would we not be contenders? All the players in the squad are really good. The expectations are always really high. But we have to play to win because we are England. We are one of the best teams in the world who can play against all the teams out there. This is my opinion. We have to play always with the spirit we played this evening.\" England's celebrations were unaffected by Kasnic's reaction at the end. \"Their No17 spat at me,\" said Terry. \"It's not a nice reaction. He came on frustrated, but it's not nice at all. He's the first person who's ever spat at me in my career. It's disappointing to see, but let's not let it ruin a massive night.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
