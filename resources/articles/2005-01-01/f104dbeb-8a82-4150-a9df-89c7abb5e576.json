So far the Parkhead manager has not ventured into the transfer market during the January window and he considers the most significant signing as being that by John Hartson to a deal which will keep him at Celtic Park until May 2007, so ending speculation over his future. O'Neill has also offered new deals to his former Northern Ireland captain Neil Lennon and the French central defender Bobo Balde, and has held talks with the versatile Jackie McNamara. The three are among a number of players whose contracts expire in the summer. \"I think that getting sensible and decent offers to your big players at the football club is probably even more important than getting acquisitions in,\" he said yesterday. \"Replacing some of these lads who are out of contract would be extremely difficult and I'm sure that the club is going to do everything it possibly can to make very fair offers to them during the course of this month. \"This will be done bearing in mind what they've done for us and what they'll be able to contribute in the future and, if the players themselves feel that they want to keep their options open, I don't think we can argue with that. But we shall certainly be doing everything we possibly can.\" Hartson scored the winner against Rangers in Sunday's Scottish Cup tie and O'Neill believes that goal served to underline just how important the Wales striker is to Celtic. \"I think that John would have been very difficult to replace,\" O'Neill added. \"We've already lost Henrik [Larsson], who was a big, big goalscorer here and an iconic figure, and to then lose Hartson, whose goal ratio is absolutely phenomenal, would have been a massive blow. \"But thankfully we've got the deal sorted out and there's no doubt that everyone saw on Sunday why we're so delighted that he's staying here for a while longer. His goalscoring record against Rangers is something I know he's very proud of, and justifiably so.\" Hartson admits he was relieved that the protracted talks over his future resulted in him staying at Celtic but claims the financial aspect was never his motivation. \"It was never about the money. I wanted the two-and-a-half years more than anything else,\" said Hartson, who had been linked with a move to Hertha Berlin. \"With my injury problems the club were a little bit reluctant early on in the talks to give me that length [of contract] but once the final details and terms were agreed it was just a matter of us getting round the table and signing.\" Meanwhile the part-timers East Fife have been given an extra incentive to win their replay against Dunfermline and take on Celtic in the Scottish Cup fourth round. Sky have opted to screen the tie live, guaranteeing the home side a windfall of \u00a382,500 from broadcasting rights alone. Jim Moffat's side, who are currently fourth from bottom in Division Three, held the Premierleague side to a goalless draw at Bayview on Saturday. The two teams meet again at Parkhead next Tuesday for the right to entertain the holders on February 6 with a noon kick-off. Celtic will also bank a half share. The Aberdeen manager Jimmy Calderwood believes the signing of the teenager Jamie Winter is a step towards recreating the dynasty once built at the club by Sir Alex Ferguson. The 19-year-old midfielder has signed a two-year deal and joins on a free transfer from Leeds United. Calderwood is hoping to emulate the success Ferguson enjoyed at Pittodrie in the 1980s by building a side around young talent. \"It has been my dream to build a young Scottish team that is going to go on together like the other man from Govan had here years ago,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can build something that can last.\" Calderwood is also hoping to sign the former Charlton Athletic goalkeeper Sasa Ilic on a short-term contract as cover for Ryan Esson while the first choice David Preece recovers from injury. \"The good thing is he has a British passport,\" said Calderwood, \"so there will be no problem with red tape.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
