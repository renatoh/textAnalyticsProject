We would have provided Atwood with a synthesis in her dialectic of Orwellian hard terror and Huxleyan soft terror. John Hoyles Hull Orwell reviewed in Tribune Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, which he had read in French: \"The first thing,\" he wrote, \"anyone would notice about We is the fact - never pointed out, I believe - that Aldous Huxley's Brave New World must be partly derived from it.\" Alan Myers Hitchin, Hertfordshire Atwood didn't refer to EM Forster's anti-Wellsian long short story of 1909, \"The Machine Stops\". Forster describes a future technological mastery, leading to an atrophying of human strength, to complacency on a global scale, and ultimately to catastrophe - material that resonates more and more as the decades pass. Martyn Berry Sevenoaks, Kent Trainspotting Novelist and railway enthusiast Andrew Martin (\"On the right track\", November 17) should read Julien Gracq's A Balcony in the Forest (1958). It opens in October 1939 with a seemingly realist description of a solitary reservist officer cadet leaving, on an empty train, for a posting in the Ardennes. As he reaches a remote station at nightfall, his journey is transformed into a mythological quest. At the local command post he receives orders to proceed to an isolated bunker in the forest where he will undergo a sentimental and spiritual initiation. Yet even here the sound of trains and passing convoys remains present in his experience, a constant reminder of the world outside and the preparations for war. By way of contrast, the opening scene of Raymond Queneau's Zazie in the Metro (1959) is set in a crowded Gare d'Austerlitz, where Uncle Gabriel's bizarre exchanges with other travellers precede an even more disorientating encounter with his precocious niece, Zazie, also on a journey of discovery. Mark Stroud Cardiff I was disappointed that Andrew Martin did not mention WG Sebald's Austerlitz. In the novel, the author meets his eponymous hero, an architectural historian, at the central station in Antwerp, designed by Louis Delacenserie and based on the Pantheon of Rome. As a five-year-old child, Austerlitz was put on a Kindertransport train destined for England at Wilsonova station in Prague in order to save his life from the Nazis. Half a century later, as if in a surreal dream, he remembers being met by two strangers - his adoptive parents - on his arrival at Liverpool Street Station in London. His father had disappeared at Gare d'Austerlitz, bound for one of the gas chambers. Sam Banik London Night flowers Seumas Milne refers to Batista's heirs preparing to reclaim the bordellos that Castro closed or expropriated after 1959 (\"Cuba libre\", November 10). Prostitution in Cuba is one of the most serious issues affecting my country and is a big stain on the many achievements of Castro's governments. Listen to Silvio Rodr\u00edguez's song \"Night Flowers\", about the prostitutes who populate Havana's renowned Fifth Avenue. Mario Lopez-Goicoechea London Act of remembrance Richard Holmes got it almost, but not quite, right in his appreciation of The World at War (\"Armistice day\", November 10). The series contained 26, not 25 episodes, and each lasted about 52 minutes, not an hour. I was puzzled by his claim that the transcripts have been \"embargoed\" by the Imperial War Museum. Many were used by Mark Arnold-Foster in his book that accompanied the 1973 series, and the transcripts have always been available to scholars and members of the public. As for \"Stalingrad\", an episode for which I was responsible, there are no jolly peasants or workers singing at their lathes. When two Soviet armies linked up to seal the fate of the German forces trapped in and around the city, I wrote: \"It had all gone so quickly there was no time to film it. So it was re-enacted for the newsreels.\" Sharp-eyed viewers might have seen that as an invitation, or rather an admonition, to view all examples of jolly peasants and singing lathe turners, as well as smiling SS officers and cheerful concentration camp inmates, with scepticism.
