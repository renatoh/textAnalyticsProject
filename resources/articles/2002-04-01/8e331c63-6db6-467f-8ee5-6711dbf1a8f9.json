Among them, in a nutrition section entitled Keep Fat With Gazza, is \"12 exciting ways to eat a Mars Bar\". Number four is \"Eat it on a bus\". Thirteen years on and with his 35th birthday next month, Gascoigne's appetite and mode of transport have changed. Turkey, it seems, has suddenly appeared on the menu which Gascoigne will appraise as he decides on his football future. That appraisal could begin as early as tomorrow night. Burnley, to whom Gascoigne is contracted to the end of the season, play Coventry City at Turf Moor tomorrow and even victory might not secure a play-off place for Stan Ternent's team. Norwich, who host relegated Stockport, have the same points and the same goal difference. If Burnley lose out, then there is every possibility that Gascoigne will have played his last match in English football, 18 seasons after he played his first. Of course he may not get on. \"I'll pick the team I think is best for the occasion,\" said Ternent yesterday. Gascoigne was in training yesterday morning but the implication in Ternent's words was that he will not start against Coventry. So the 9,275 at Blundell Park last Saturday who saw Gascoigne replace Kevin Ball at half-time when already 3-0 down, may already have witnessed the English end of a remarkable era, one that began as a 17-year-old substitute against QPR in 1985. For, even if Burnley do go up, there is little prospect of Gascoigne going up with them. A season that began with him dreaming publicly of inclusion in the World Cup squad, ended with Gascoigne saying: \"Stan knows what is best for the team; if that means I am best on the bench, then that is fine.\" His final playing days will instead lie abroad. Several countries have already been reported in speculation but the most intriguing perhaps was mentioned yesterday by Gascoigne's Newcastle-based representative, Ian Elliott: Turkey has apparently come on to the horizon. \"I can't honestly say whether it'll be Paul's last game in English football on Sunday,\" said Elliott, \"but there's a chance. We're just waiting until the end of the season; everybody's just waiting to see where Burnley are next season. \"Then we will sit down and weigh up everything, not just on the football side but also the financial aspects. Paul has had a multitude of offers from overseas: Dubai, China, Japan, the United States, Turkey. Dubai's not bad, China's interesting. We'll look at them all and decide in the coming months.\" Elliott would not elaborate on the Turkish interest but Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas are the only clubs who could afford his wages. Galatasaray made a similar signing when Gheorghe Hagi joined three years ago, although Hagi was 31 at the time and was able to inspire Galatasaray to a Uefa Cup triumph. Gascoigne was unable to hold down a place at Everton this season, although one thing that Ternent said when he persuaded Gascoigne to Turf Moor would explain Turkish interest: \"When you sign Paul Gascoigne, you know what you are letting yourself in for in terms of publicity.\" \"Playing abroad would not bother him,\" Elliott said of Gascoigne. \"He's played on the biggest stages in the world. But Paul is a worrier, he takes a lot to heart and this is on his mind; he'd rather know sooner than later.\" Gascoigne has talked in the past of his desire to manage but he has no plans to take coaching badge courses this summer. He will cover the World Cup as a TV panellist but after that he clearly thinks he can play on. The destination is uncertain but one thing is for sure: Jimmy \"Five Bellies\" will go with him. Also known as James Gardner, Five Bellies became a Shakespearean adjunct to Gascoigne as he swept England off its feet with his tears in Turin 12 years ago. With New Order providing the soundtrack, this was one of the definitive moments of English football's reinvention as touchy and trendy after the disasters and tragedies of the 1980s. Gascoigne became a genuine icon but, as Newcastle became Tottenham became Lazio became Rangers became Middlesbrough became Everton and finally Burnley, Gascoigne shared personal calamities that eventually led last year to a declaration of alcoholism. Along the way some public sympathy waned but within football Gascoigne has remained popular and a must-see. \"Ability-wise, I'd say Paul Gascoigne was the greatest,\" Stuart Pearce said yesterday of those he has played with. It is the view of a generation. That is the reason why, when Gascoigne agreed to perform at a fund-raiser for Gateshead FC on Tuesday, 13 years after leaving Newcastle, the event was sold out immediately and extra seats had to be found. It was held in Dunston, where it all began, whose people were the object of the dedication of Daft As A Brush. \"I couldn't let Gateshead die,\" Gascoigne said. \"I'm proud of my roots and this is where my heart is.\" But his immediate future lies elsewhere; he could yet be talking Turkey.
