The first has to do with the exploitation of women, and the habitual depiction of seemingly undernourished, semi-naked girls within the pages of what purports to be a serious newspaper. The second deals with the absurd notion of devoting valuable column inches to a subject as frivolous and nonsensical as frocks when there's a war going on/people are dying in famines/entire cities are being swallowed up by earthquakes. The third and, in my experience as sometime fashion editor of this paper, by far the most vitriolic, is that which complains about the degree of London-centricity in terms of stockists and outlets, and the assumption that beyond the M25, nobody is remotely interested in buying fashionable clothes. I am a little ashamed to say it now, but I recall that most of the letters I received along these lines were greeted with a derisory snort before being swiftly condemned to a file marked Sad Loon, along with the certifiable ramblings of green Biro-wielding perverts and radical feminists. I say ashamed because, having moved to the country from London five years ago, I now classify myself as one of these disgruntled rural folk, and I know exactly how they feel. But I also know that fashion editors aren't malicious dictators intent on alienating those living outside a five-mile radius of Hoxton Square. Nor do they have us all down as welly-wearing sheep-shaggers in egg-stained knitwear. They simply know what I now know: outside major cities, there are precious few interesting, fashionable clothes to be found. And believe me, I've looked. Let's just say that, after years of fruitless searching for a countryside equivalent of Brompton Cross in among the thatch and half-timbering, I have been forced to lower my sights somewhat. I never thought I'd find my pulse quickening at the sight of the Bury St Edmunds branch of Phase Eight, but it does now. I nearly wept when I found my first French Connection concession buried away in a mass of tweed and beige rainwear in a fusty small-town department store, and Debenhams, once a place I would hurry past on Oxford Street en route to somewhere more interesting, has become my Selfridges, my Harvey Nichols, my everything. Generally, though, I despair. If the demographic and social profile of a region was compiled based on the kind of clothes stocked by its shops, you would have to surmise that East Anglia is largely populated by retired dog-breeders and surfers with, perhaps, a smattering of legal secretaries soaking up the middle-age range. You might think that now would be a good time to bring up Johnnie Boden (who, incidentally, I want to slap, if only for those horrible men's brushed cotton checked \"pull-ons\") and that burgeoning list of other mail-order labels willing to help rescue the parched wardrobes of the country-bound. But I refuse to go down the catalogue route. Buying clothes by mail order is like eating caviar in pill form, or having internet sex. A large part of the pleasure associated with clothes buying has to do with personal selection, with touching and feeling and the rush that comes with trying things on in a shop. Not the same as being handed a plastic package by a not very attractive postman in a one-horse Suffolk village. So I will plod on with shops, but it's a thankless task. Even if the name over the door looks promising, the customer in search of something faintly cutting edge is generally scuppered by the personal idiosyncracies of that store's buyer. The out-of-town fashion buyer is someone I would like to meet, because she is one warped individual. I imagine she frequently congratulates herself on her spot-on insight into the sartorial limitations of the average country dweller. She has us down as timid, unadventurous shoppers for whom a barely detectable variation on a jumper neckline is quite enough fashion for one season, thank you. Entire trends pass unnoticed and ignored. She doesn't like florals, checks or floor-sweeping asymmetry (we bumpkins have trailing-in-mud issues) and thinks that any funny business with quirky fashion detail is best left to those racy folk up west. Now I am exhausted, defeated, and, lately, sense in myself a serious waning of interest on the clothes front. How else to explain the fact that I have been rotating the same two pairs of jeans and three jumpers on continuous loop for about eight months now? Significantly, out here there are no style police to monitor my downward spiral (note to self: put in call to the Met to request urgent backup), and no one fashion conscious enough to know or care whether I am bang up to the minute, way ahead of my time or hopelessly locked in a 1980s timewarp. Perhaps I should be worried, but instead I find I am relieved. Lack of choice is, like naked skydiving and shouting \"Arse!\" in church, fantastically liberating. Besides, us folk out here in the sticks find that with fashion duly dismissed as a confounded waste of time, we can turn our hands to other variations on Outraged of Suffolk hate mail, such as - and my subscription hangs in the balance over this one - why, when space is tight, Ipswich UGC cinema is routinely dropped from the entertainment listings. If I didn't know this was destined straight for a file labelled Mad Yokel, I might actually send it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
