The proposal is one idea being put forward by David Freud, the investment banker, appointed by Tony Blair and John Hutton, the works and pensions secretary, to come up with fresh thinking to modernise the welfare state. Yesterday the idea had an enthusiastic response from Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations. \"This marries the need for people to get out of the hands of loan sharks and back into a job.\" Mr Freud has found that one of the major reasons why the long term unemployed refuse to take a job is because they are so much in debt that they see no point of going back to work just to service punitive interest charges on loans. He believes that if an offer of a job was combined with a plan to reschedule debts with a new bank, it would become much more attractive to come off the dole. Official figures show a record 30,000 people going into voluntary bankruptcy while the Citizens Advice Bureau dealt with 1.4m people last year who came for help with debt problems. Mr Freud's proposal will be included in measures including a much larger role for the voluntary and private sectors in delivering welfare to work services . These include a proposal to part privatise Jobcentre Plus which pays benefits and helps the unemployed get back to work. Mr Freud wants to agency to concentrate on paying benefits and helping claimants on Jobseekers Allowance get back to work within a year. Its work with the long term unemployed would be transferred to a new private agency charged with commissioning voluntary bodies and private companies to provide services. Mr Freud also wants a substantial increase in the money on training and employing people to help people get back to work. He says the figure should be more than tripled from \u00a35,000 per claimant a year to nearer \u00a318,000. Mr Freud is said to argue that since most of the unemployed stay out of work for as long as 10 years, such a increase in the budget will be a long term saving. The plans involving the voluntary sector received strong support from charity sector. Mr Bubb ,said: \"We believe the third sector would be well equipped to help the long term unemployed , including the disabled and the mentally ill. Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat spokesman on social exclusion, was keen to see how the proposal to offer cheap loans would be fleshed out. He welcomed the plan to give the third sector a major role in delivering services to the unemployed. \"If anything I am not sure whether the proposal goes far enough.\" Unions, already engaged in strike action over job cuts and pay, were furious about breaking up Jobcentre Plus but privately sympathetic to the idea of helping the unemployed get out of debt. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said: \"You have to question whether there is the capacity, knowledge and expertise within the private and third sector to deliver. The government should look to invest in its own workforce's expertise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
