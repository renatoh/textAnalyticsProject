But for some time, there have been mutterings that the programme is performing below-par - and those defining run-ins are too thin on the ground. In fact it was Paxman who kick-started the debate a year ago, when he used his MacTaggart lecture at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival to highlight the plight of the programme he has worked on for nearly 20 years. Newsnight was being undermined by budget cuts of 15%, he said, with a further 20% cut by 2010.\"We have lost producers, researchers and reporters. Nor can we make the films we once made. It is unsustainable and I cannot see how the programme can survive in anything like its current form.\" His audience may have gasped - but as Paxman has privately acknowledged, his speech had no effect and cuts have continued. In addition, the programme's editor, Peter Barron, who brought a modern, mischievous streak, left last month to join Google. The search is on for his successor, and an appointment is expected by the end of next month. The question is: what will he or she inherit? While Paxman remains silent, sources say his opinion is unchanged: Newsnight's lifeblood is draining away, and it continues to be erratic. Embarrassing technical glitches are also being blamed on cutbacks - last Monday, as he came off air he once again snorted \"bloody shambles\". It is not, however, that simple. The audience - of which 40% are over 65, and 55% are male and upmarket - is not only bearing up, but gently rising. There is no shortage of huge news stories for Newsnight to tackle, and some think the programme is dealing with them very well. \"Newsnight is having a very good period, helped by the riveting nature of recent news flow,\" says the former BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies. \"Its coverage of the financial crisis has been good, and its output on Gordon Brown's political problems has been fair and compelling. If Paxman is not the best current affairs interviewer on television, he is certainly up there with the very best. Michael Crick has picked up the political role very successfully. I have not noticed any drop in quality since the cuts were announced.\" But while David Kermode, the editor of Five news, is largely complimentary - \"I watch it. I enjoy it. I regard it as a luxury item. If I'm not interested in their big story of the night I switch off\" - other competitors are less so. Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's controller of news and current affairs, is with Paxman. \"I no longer see it as a rival,\" she says. \"The programme is insufficiently newsy; it needs more news, it needs more current affairs - more proper foreign affairs films in particular. And less gassing. There's just far too much chat; presenters talking to correspondents.\" C4 News is, of course, a direct rival of Newsnight. Jon Snow is Paxman's equal, and its political correspondent, Cathy Newman, recently told the Labour whip Siobhain McDonagh live on air that she had been sacked. But criticism is not limited to competitors. \"Of course there is concern,\" says one well-placed BBC source. \"There is even talk of whether it should be remodelled as a discussion programme, which would save money.\" Others believe that, at a time of reduced BBC income, there should be a decision about what is most important. \"No one disputes the need to be more efficient,\" says another source. \"But the cuts are pretty swingeing. It is uncomfortable.\" One of the flash points is foreign reporting. \"There is a specific problem faced by independent film-makers, when they pitch to Newsnight,\" says Mark Galloway, director of the International Broadcasting Trust. \"There is now definitely a problem covering stories off the immediate agenda.\" Galloway cites a recent story about comedians in Kenya involved with politics. Newsnight paid \u00a310,000 towards a film that cost double that. \"It's as if the people who control contracts and budgets are making editorial decisions, and the programme is being suffocated by budgetary decisions,\" says Maggie O'Kane, editorial director of Guardian Films. \"The accountants at the BBC are expecting independent film-makers to go to really dangerous places, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, for a low rate. Film-makers are just going to stop going to them.\" Certainly, Newsnight has a modest budget of around \u00a38.5m a year, under half that of C4 News. The programme's defenders, however, point to the way that it manages to retain a top team of correspondents. \"It's all to do with inventiveness; being original,\" one says . Ron Neil, Newsnight's editor during the Falklands war and a former managing director of BBC news and current affairs, is in this camp. \"I still watch it. It is a programme that is so strong when Paxman is at the helm,\" he says. \"When Paxman's there, if there's a strong editor, and if it is on form, the budget is irrelevant.\" Paxman, though, is contracted for only 100 days a year, sharing duties with Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis and Gavin Esler. In addition, the issues go wider than presenting and editing. There is the timing, for instance. Until 2000 Newsnight began an hour after the Nine O'clock News ended. Now it must provide an instant follow-up after a 10pm bulletin. \"Behind all of this is a broader issue, its place in the firmament,\" says Steve Mitchell, deputy director of BBC news and head of multimedia programmes. \"It has to fight hard for its place in a crowded world and exploit its content more widely. When it does the big interview, for example, that needs to be available online. When Paul Mason went to Kenya, we sent a producer versed in audio and online.\" The selection of the next editor is crucial. Mitchell, who is in charge of the process, says that there is a big field. \"I'm interested in innovation, a sense of humour, someone more on the creative side of things,\" he says. \"Peter Barron is a hard act to follow.\" The debate about Newnight's future, including its extended running time and Newsnight Review, will take place after the editor is appointed. But some viewers, such as Professor Brian Winston, an award-winning World In Action producer turned academic, believe that the problems run deep. \"Somebody once said: 'I don't read newspapers, I've read them before' - I fear that seems to apply even more aptly to today's current affairs television,\" he says. \"I don't watch Newsnight. I think that problem is confounded because there is a real sense of having heard it all before ... [But] I am looking at exhilarating, wonderful content, as they insist on calling it, on the digital channels.\" In-house candidates for the editorship include Jasmin Bhuttar, Newsnight's deputy editor and a rising star; Daniel Pearl, deputy editor of the 10 O'Clock News; Eddie Morgan, an ex-Newsnight staffer who worked for the Labour party, before editing The Culture Show; and Peter Rippon, who edits PM and Broadcasting House on Radio 4. Everyone agrees the Newsnight editorship is a crucial role. But there could also be a sting in the tail for whoever emerges as Barron's successor - having to find the next Paxman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
