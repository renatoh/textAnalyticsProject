But there is some good news. First, the newest diesel vehicles produce much less air pollution than the ones they are replacing. By discouraging older vehicles and upgrading buses, nitrogen dioxide from traffic in London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone has fallen by about one third. Second, particle pollution in China\u2019s megacities has decreased by 34-49% in just five years. Third, a recent review across four continents showed that reducing air pollution improved health and brought about changes that could be seen within weeks or months. These examples show what can be achieved in a short time. This might seem obvious, given the huge evidence of harm from breathing dirty air, but these findings take us beyond describing the problem to demonstrating the benefits from fixing it. This is an important message to counter vested interests which benefit from using our air as a waste disposal route. Fourth, is the increased public clamour for action. Local campaigners are closing streets around schools. Extinction Rebellion and striking schoolchildren are highlighting clean air alongside our climate emergency. Next, we need politicians to seize this opportunity to create a step-change in people\u2019s health."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
