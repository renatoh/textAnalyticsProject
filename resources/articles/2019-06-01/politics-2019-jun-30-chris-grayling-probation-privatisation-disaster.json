Probation officers say bigger caseloads and unrealistic targets, ushered in when Grayling was the justice secretary, have meant that they are unable to keep to the same standards as before. More than a third \u2013 36% \u2013 of those interviewed as part of the research admit that they regularly cut corners and compromise professional standards to meet targets. \u201cThe privatisation of probation is unprecedented in terms of its scale and scope and it has proven to be something of an unmitigated disaster for professionals,\u201d write Professor Gill Kirton, of Queen Mary University of London, and Dr C\u00e9cile Guillaume, of Roehampton University, in the journal Work, Employment and Society, published by the British Sociological Association. The pair looked at the effects of the government\u2019s privatisation of about half of the probation service in 2015, in which lower-risk offenders were monitored by 21 private companies and the rest left to public sector organisations. They surveyed almost 1,000 probation officers, and carried out face-to-face research with 100. More than a third said they did not have enough time for their clients. More than half said their targets were unrealistic. In a typical comment, one probation officer told researchers: \u201cI truly believe that offenders will receive a poorer service and staff will struggle to provide the high level of service they have always given. Consequently, the public will be at risk.\u201d Another said: \u201cI do not consider that we are in a position to protect the public, but we will be the scapegoats when tragedies happen.\u201d In their report Kirton and Guillaume said the privatisation had been carried out in the face of \u201cmassive opposition from criminal justice experts, senior probation leaders, the unions representing probation workers, and the workers themselves\u201d and with \u201cno meaningful consultation\u201d. It had created \u201cconveyor belt\u201d conditions in the privatised part of the service that meant officers were having to \u201ccompromise what they regarded as professional standards\u201d. Since the research was carried out, the government has announced plans to bring the probation service fully back into public ownership. The Ministry of Justice said: \u201cWe have already announced plans to reform our probation system to better support officers and ensure stringent, enforceable community sentences. \u201cOur changes will recognise the specialism and value of probation work, while supporting staff to develop the right skills and expertise. \u201cOur previous reforms extended probation supervision to around 40,000 extra offenders each year \u2013 a positive change for public safety \u2013 who would have otherwise been unsupervised.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
