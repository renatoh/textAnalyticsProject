The new Speaker, John Boehner, said he had asked the sergeant at arms, the US Capitol police and the FBI to \"conduct an in-depth security overview\". He also asked them to brief members' staff in offices round the country. US Capitol police on Sunday called for members of Congress to take extra security steps. A member of Congress, Jason Chaffetz, from Utah, said he will investigate whether US marshals, who guard federal judges, can be expanded to guard members of Congress. There could be small changes, such as security being deployed for occasions regarded as particularly threatening. But in reality not much else is likely to change. The White House is like a fortress, relatively difficult for casual visitors to get inside and Barack Obama is protected round the clock. But there are 535 members of Congress \u2013 100 in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives\u2013 and it would be too expensive to mount anything remotely close to the level of security Obama enjoys. Even if members were offered the chance of personal security, many, probably most, would refuse. There is a tradition of accessibility to lawmakers. Members of the public, after passing through a metal detector at the entrance to Congress and its adjoining buildings, are relatively free to wander round the building. They can see their representatives in the chamber, in committee hearings or at their offices. Facing re-election every two years in the case of the house, members are keen to ensure constituents are not cut off from them. Such a free and easy approach is even more evident back in their home districts, where members and their staff make themselves available at a host of meetings. Members report that over the last two years, as the political rhetoric has grown more heated, there has been an increase in the number of threats, but this does not seem to have changed the views of members. Mike Capuanao, a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, told Politico website he was not changing his lifestyle. He had installed a security system in his home when he was elected, but that was it. \"Even if they gave us each a bodyguard many of us wouldn't take it, including myself,\" said Capuano. \"The Capitol is pretty secure as far as I know, but when you're out in the street there's really not much you can do. We all know there are nuts out there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
