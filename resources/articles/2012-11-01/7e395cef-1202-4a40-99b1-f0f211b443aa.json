Even at this late stage \u2013 the white smoke is expected within a few weeks \u2013 there is much furious lobbying, both by those who wish Lord Justice Leveson to turn the statutory thumbscrews on journalists and, on the other side, by those who believe that the judge may be set on sweeping away 200 years or more of press freedom. Into the midst of this heady atmosphere has burst the Jimmy Savile story \u2013 which has been instantly seized on by all sides to prove one point or another. Savile can be a clarion call for an unshackled press or, seen differently, it can demonstrate that statutory regulation is hardly an obstacle to robust investigative journalism (the story was, after all, broken by Ofcom-regulated ITV). In other hands it can demonstrate how admirably transparent the BBC is, or else can be used to prove that the corporation \u2013 which is probably the most trusted and admired news organisation in the world \u2013 is in fact utterly corrupt and contemptible and in need of a Leveson inquiry all of its own. Middle ground The debate has, in other words, become a little overheated \u2013 particularly given that few, if any, have any idea what Sir Brian actually has in mind and that the judge is unlikely to be much impressed by vocal last-minute campaigning by either side. He presumably well understands that the lobbying is less aimed at him as at the politicians who will, in time, have to reach a decision on his recommendations. From his own pronouncements and questions while his inquiry was sitting, we can hazard a guess that Sir Brian is likely to be examining the middle ground between the two extremes being urged on him. There is real opportunity in this space, otherwise known as independent regulation. Sir Brian can build on the real progress made by Lord Black in outlining a new system of regulation which enjoys widespread support across the press. This proposal is not, as its critics claim, the status quo. It promises real investigations, tough sanctions and a commitment to the enforcement of standards that its predecessor, the PCC, did not have. It is, as drafted, far from perfect. It vests too much power in an industry funding body which retains key powers over the regulator, especially the ability to appoint the press members of key committees. Students of the PCC \u2013 and of how it came to produce such a lamentable response to the phone-hacking scandal \u2013 will know these are the very mechanics of the old discredited system. Leveson will surely reject them, as would parliament. Use of statute But there is still merit in the outline Black plan, which goes some way to solving the so-called Richard Desmond problem \u2013 the fear that major publishers could undermine the system by simply leaving it \u2013 by requiring all publishers over a certain size to sign a five-year contract. Critics argue that this is insufficiently enduring. But this is where Leveson's idea of adding an arbitral arm to the regulator for legal press complaints could be critical. The arbitral wing would give cheap and quick justice to complainants and publishers alike. It would reward those in the system by offering legal defences and lower penalties. Some observers point out that such an arbitral system would need to be enshrined in law with the press regulator recognised in statute. That may be true, but this use of statute merely builds on the precedent of section 12 of the Human Rights Act, which asks judges to consider regulatory codes in their deliberations over free expression. For the press to oppose such a limited use of statute as a matter of principle would seem to be counter-productive. This creation of a quick and simplified arbitral system \u2013 along with the defamation bill currently wending its way through parliament \u2013 would do much to address the scandal of Britain's libel laws as well as making the new regulatory system work. One of the most important media lessons about Jimmy Savile may be that, while there was nothing in regulation to stop newspapers exposing Savile during his lifetime, there was plenty to deter them in the libel laws. Some of the victims of hacking are, understandably, sceptical about any voluntary system. We sympathise with these concerns. But the trouble with compulsory regulation is that, in the wrong hands, it could edge us back towards something that looks like the licensing of the press and of journalists \u2013 something that was abolished in the late 17th century and which has no place in a free society. Some counter that this is a baseless fear, claiming that it would be possible to enshrine in law the regulator's independence from both government and the newspaper industry. These are reasonable arguments to make in reasonable times. But will we always live in such times? The question is whether, having once conceded parliament's right to lay down the law about the regulation of the press, a Rubicon has been crossed \u2013 at least politically. Europe may be on the brink of a period of social turbulence \u2013 with all the authoritarian responses that will almost inevitably follow. See this week's arrest of the Greek journalist Costas Vaxevanis for publishing the names of alleged tax evaders. And look at the fury recently directed by the press and MPs at the BBC's news operation and see how ugly the mood can turn against even the most ethical and professional news organisations. Independent regulation There are plenty of laws already affecting journalists in this country. The argument is sometimes advanced that \u2013 given these laws \u2013 we should just leave it to the police. But the phone-hacking saga revealed that Britain's largest police force behaved in an extraordinary way when confronted with the might of one immensely powerful newspaper group. The law on its own is not sufficient \u2013 which is why Leveson has to consider regulation and then ask searching questions about media plurality. He must help politicians see why no media baron must ever again be allowed to carve out the kind of dominance enjoyed for more than a generation by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Our own position remains as we argued it before the inquiry this summer. We believe in independent regulation, both from politicians and the press itself. We do believe in a contract system \u2013 not the use of statute \u2013 to secure participation. But we also believe in an arbitral arm which incentivises the regulated to pursue high standards and penalises anyone who walks away. We believe that the regulator must have real investigatory powers and sanctions. And, above all, we believe in the importance of plurality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
