If you want to know about Friday night airline schedules, ask Duval. So far this season he has taken the early flight home from six of his eight tournaments, and the Masters was the latest. Whatever golfers do on free weekends, Duval has been doing a lot of it. Nobody, least of all Duval himself, knows why this should be so. On the 18th green at Royal Lytham and St Anne's two years ago, when he removed his cap and his wraparound sunglasses to accept the Open championship trophy, nothing could have seemed less likely. It was his first victory in a major, and overdue. At 29, he had long since established himself as the only man capable of consistently keeping Tiger Woods honest. By the time he won the Open, he had accumulated more than $15m (\u00a39.5m) in winnings and probably as much again in endorsements. Lytham was supposed to break the log jam that had held him back from the fullest expression of his talent. As this famously taciturn and sometimes brusque man made his charmingly modest acceptance speech, it was impossible to imagine that one major would not be followed by many more, and that he and Woods would be contending head-to-head for the big honours for years to come. Instead Duval has all but disappeared from the radar of professional golf, and the story of his last two years tells us just how far and fast a sporting hero can fall. In 2002, the year after his Open triumph, he failed to win a tournament for the first time since 1996. In golf, worth is measured in hard cash and he slumped to 80th on the money list, his earnings plunging from $2.8m to $838,000, his lowest since 1994. In 24 tournaments, he missed the cut on eight occasions - as many times as he had suffered elimination in the previous four seasons combined. And eyes were politely averted from his appearance in the US team for the postponed Ryder Cup, for which he had qualified by virtue of his 2001 performances. This season has been worse still. Cut from the Bob Hope Classic, the AT&amp;T, the Doral, the Bay Hill and the Players' Championship, he has pocketed just $14,875 from a tied 42nd place in the Nissan Open and $30,000 from a tied 33rd in the WGC-Accenture Match Play championship. Last weekend at Augusta, where he has twice finished runner-up - in 1998 after being three strokes ahead with three holes to play, and again in 2001 - his second-round score of 83, including four double bogeys, put him alongside such pensioners as Arnold Palmer and Charles Coody. The truly weird thing about all this is that Duval is the last player you would expect to be brought low in such a manner. He was, after all, practically born to play golf. His father and his uncle are club pros, and there can be nothing about the game that he does not know. But maybe that's the problem. Perhaps there has simply been too much golf in David Duval's comparatively short life. Looking at his name on the claret jug that sunlit afternoon in the summer of 2001, he reflected on all the fuss surrounding him in words that carry a very different resonance now. \"It's a silly old game,\" he said, \"I've made it a lot bigger than it is, too, at times. Maybe that's some of the reason I feel so good today. Maybe I finally realised that it's just a game.\" In the PGA's player guide, Duval's hobbies are listed as reading, fly-fishing, surfing, skiing, baseball, mountain biking and snowboarding. Maybe it's time to take advantage of the six-year qualifying exemption that comes with victory in a major. Time to throw the rod, the bike and the Malibu board in the back of the SUV, along with a few good books, and just take off. Time to get golf out of his mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
