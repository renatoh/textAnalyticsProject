Fitness fanatic Mr Bond, who keeps in shape by legging it along the canal towpaths of Leeds, reckons he has detected a little middle-age spread at Asda - coincidentally, also 40 this year. The taut and rather spiky Mr Bond likens Asda's problems to waking up one day and realising that where once there was lean and rippling muscle there is now quivering flab and cellulite. His solution? A swift get-fit campaign. As we all know, there is no gain without pain. In Asda's case that means 200 head office jobs and another 1,200 junior managerial positions in stores. The money saved will be ploughed into the stores in the form of more shopfloor staff - or \"hourly paid colleagues\", as they prefer to call them in Asdaland. It is a strategy that has paid some dividends for Mr Bond's former Asda colleague Justin King, at Sainsbury's. These cuts, however - and let's be clear about this - are absolutely unconnected to Asda's current plight, ie: turning in \"below plan\" profits for his bosses at Wal-Mart and losing market share at a quite alarming rate. According to Mr Bond, Asda doesn't really have any problems and he would be doing exactly the same thing if Asda was growing like Topsy (or like Tesco). He dismisses his Wal-Mart masters as mere stakeholders, \"somewhere between a shareholder and a non-executive director\". Yesterday Mr Bond was promising a new spirit of glasnost at Asda, but the immediate evidence is not particularly encouraging. How much will the job cuts cost and ultimately save? He's not saying. How much will be ploughed back into \"increasing the colleague-count\"? Er, he doesn't have the figure. Could it be about 50%? Can't say, but more than 10% and less than 95%. When does he expect Sainsbury's to steal back its position as the UK's No 2 grocer (as Mr Bond has himself predicted)? Don't know, and he certainly doesn't lose any sleep over it. What do the Bentonville boys think about being No 3? He doesn't know. Why, exactly, is Asda underperforming (its market share is going backwards while Tesco strides ever onwards)? It isn't. We could go on, but you get the picture. Mr Bond's \"five key building blocks\" are going to \"re-ignite\" Asda's dowdy performance. They are simplicity, cost-cutting, low prices, better retail house keeping and concentrating on Asda's points of difference (like, he explained, \u00a35 trade-ins on old ties for Father's Day). These five targets are going to take Asda back to its \"spiritual home of extraordinary sales outperformance\". Frankly, we doubt it will put more than a small dent in the bumper of the Tesco juggernaut. Mr Bond needs more space to compete nose-to-nose with Terry Leahy. Given the current competition commission approach and tough planning laws, he isn't going to get it. Gravy How's this for financial chutzpah? When the flotation of bread and gravy group RHM was formally announced last month, the financial advisers attributed a value of \u00a31bn-\u00a31.3bn to the business. But now that investment bankers CSFB have done their homework, and presumably some quiet market testing, the projected market value has been slashed to between \u00a3875m and \u00a3975m. A bookbuilding exercise was begun with institutions yesterday so as to establish a firm price. Yet despite a huge portion of the potential risk being removed from this share sale, CSFB is still taking an underwriting fee to underpin the issue at 228p a share, or \u00a3875m. The quintessentially English system of underwriting share issues was developed to give sellers of stock, such as a company making a rights issue, certainty that they would receive the full proceeds. Bookbuilding, a system developed in America, does much the same thing - establishing a price at which institutions agree to support an issue. Since with RHM the bulk of the uncertainty has been removed, the need for underwriting falls away. The vendors of RHM, venture capitalists Doughty Hanson don't seem to mind that CSFB are booking themselves a fat fee for taking minimal risk, but then that's probably because the floated company will be picking up the tab. Health addicts After paying \u00a3875m for the Priory yesterday, ABN Amro must be banking on an increasing flow of therapy junkies and booze and drug-addled famous folk. The price is 23 times 2004's Ebitda, which appears to be a record for the healthcare industry in the UK. Slowly but surely a bubble has emerged over the past 18 months as private equity groups have become hooked on healthcare assets, including nursing homes. Some industry insiders were suggesting yesterday that the Priory deal might just be the healthcare equivalent of Lastminute.com. Except if this bubble pops the casualties won't be dotcom whizz kids, they could be the elderly and those with mental health problems, most of which are being funded by the NHS."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
