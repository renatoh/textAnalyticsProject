Queens Park Rangers arrived under instruction to demand a towel from the ballboy each time they took a throw\u2011in, mimicking Stoke City's Rory Delap. Luke Young looked embarrassed about doing so early on in the game, but by the break QPR were making such use of the hosts' linen that the ballboys were sent out empty-handed for the second half. \"You either have the towel or you don't; you can't take them away at half-time because your team are losing. So I went and fetched my own towel,\" said Neil Warnock, whose coaching staff were chastised by the referee for doing so. When a towel later emerged from the home dugout, the ensuing row ended with the Stoke physio Andy Davies being sent off. The denouement of this amusingly absurd subplot was the least of Tony Pulis's complaints, however, after the referee ignored two Stoke penalty claims. When Joey Barton stepped across Jermaine Pennant in the seventh minute the contact appeared minimal, but when play was waved on after Barton's clumsy challenge on Robert Huth in the closing minutes, crowd and bench leapt as one to protest. \"They're decisions that could have gone our way easily,\" Pulis said, though he seemed keen not to be drawn in to a refereeing row. Besides, this was hardly a faultless Stoke performance: after a lively start brought Jonathan Walters's fourth league goal of the season, the home side found themselves pegged back by Heidar Helguson's 22nd\u2011minute header and struggling to keep hold of the ball. In central midfield, Barton and Alejandro Faurl\u00edn showed off the kind of touch that slows the clock, and such composure, coupled with the speed of Armand Traor\u00e9, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Jamie Mackie, left the Stoke defence \u2013 supposedly Pulis's strongest, with the return of Danny Higginbotham \u2013 a step behind. All three QPR goals were struck unchallenged, the second after Mackie had ghosted through the defence to turn the ball back to Luke Young. The third was a simple tap-in for Helguson, with Huth seemingly unaware of his presence at the back post. \"I need the players to stand up and do their jobs,\" said Pulis. After the visit of Blackburn Rovers next Saturday, Stoke host Dinamo Kiev. The deleterious effects of the Europa League have been much discussed but Stoke's poor run (this was a fifth defeat in six) has not yet prompted a change of tack from Pulis: \"We want to do well in Europe, it's been 30-odd years and we're desperate to experience and enjoy it.\" For Warnock, the Premier League is providing enough challenges to his squad management. Jason Puncheon fell ill before the game and reserve goalkeeper Brian Murphy pulled up in the warm-up. Young, Traor\u00e9 and Danny Gabbidon all went home sore and Helguson played most of the game with a black eye after a collision with Peter Crouch. \"It's like an accident and emergency unit at the minute,\" Warnock said. \"Adel Taarabt might have to play centre half next week.\" The question marks over Taarabt's role will not go away while the team is playing so well without him. While he spent the week on international duty, Rangers trained to negate Stoke's aerial prowess \u2013 and it worked, with three-quarters of Stoke's crosses cleared. Warnock singled out Helguson for his efforts in both boxes but all of QPR's front four dutifully tracked back. Ryan Shawcross's 64th\u2011minute goal was one of few Stoke headers to find the target; Huth, Rory Delap and substitute Kenwyne Jones all missed under pressure. \"[Against] Man City I was desperately disappointed with the result because we played some good football,\" said Warnock. \"You've seen the other side of the coin today, we had to roll our sleeves up. If we'd have had any weaknesses I think they'd have capitalised on them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
