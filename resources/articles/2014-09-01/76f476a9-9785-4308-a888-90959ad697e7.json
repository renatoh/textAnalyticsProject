He said he hoped to implement the new policies by the Super Bowl, which will take place in Glendale, Arizona on 1 February 2015. In July, Rice was given a two-game suspension as punishment for a February incident in which he punched his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, in a casino elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey, causing Palmer\u2019s head to strike a railing and her to be knocked unconscious. The length of the ban prompted extensive criticism of the league, particularly when compared to longer suspensions handed out for the use of non-performance-enhancing drugs. Last week, after a video of the punch itself was released by the website TMZ, the Ravens released Rice and the league suspended him indefinitely. The NFL players\u2019 union is appealing the league\u2019s decision and the former FBI director Robert Mueller is, at the NFL\u2019s request, leading an investigation into how the league handled Rice\u2019s punishment. Goodell and the NFL have come in for further criticism after further incidents involving NFL players came to light. The Minnesota Vikings\u2019 star running back Adrian Peterson was eventually deactivated from all team activities, after he was indicted on charges that he abused his 4-year-old son, while the Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges for allegedly head-butting his wife and breaking her nose. On Thursday, the Cardinals placed Dwyer on the reserve/non-football illness list. Two other players are currently involved in domestic violence cases. The Carolina Panthers have deactivated the defensive end Greg Hardy, who is appealing a conviction for assault on a female and communicating threats. The San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald, who was arrested and bailed for allegedly assaulting his fiancee, has not been deactivated. Goodell said \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in terms of how the league might change the way it handles domestic abuse cases, including the possibility that his role as the lead decision-maker on discipline in such instances might change. He said he had not considering resigning, despite widespread calls for him to do so. \u201cI\u2019m focused on my job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do, that\u2019s my focus.\u201d Goodell, who said he \u201cbelieved\u201d he had the support of the league\u2019s 32 team owners, was also asked if he felt under pressure from key sponsors, such as the brewer Anheuser-Busch, which have expressed concern over the league\u2019s handling of the recent cases. He said: \u201cI made it clear to sponsors directly that there are things we need to clean up in our house.\u201d The press conference was at one point momentarily interrupted by a man shrieking: \u201cDon\u2019t take me to the elevator!\u201d The man, who was later identified as Benjy Bronk, a writer for the radio personality Howard Stern, was immediately removed from the room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
