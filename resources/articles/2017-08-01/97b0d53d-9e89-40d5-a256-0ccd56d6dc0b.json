Centre for Cities said the relocation of BBC Sport and other departments in 2011 has brought 4,420 new jobs to the wider Greater Manchester area, the equivalent of 0.3% of total employment in the city. Paul Swinney, the principal economist at Centre for Cities, said the finding showed that cities bidding to be the home of Channel 4 should not expect a \u201cmajor boost\u201d to the local economy from the relocation and should consider whether to focus on addressing skills gaps or improving transport infrastructure instead. Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield and a host of other cities, have told the government they want to be the new home of Channel 4. A government consultation on the organisation\u2019s impact outside London attracted at least a dozen submissions from local authorities across the country expressing an interest in hosting a new headquarters for the organisation. The Centre for Cities report found that employment across all organisations at MediaCity has grown by 4,600 in Salford between 2011 and 2016 after the BBC\u2019s move. This represents a 43% increase. But the impact on the wider Manchester area was less pronounced because many of the jobs at MediaCity included roles that had been relocated from other parts of Manchester, Centre for Cities warned. Swinney said: \u201cThe impact of the BBC\u2019s relocation shows that the government and city leaders should not overestimate the economic benefits of moving public sector jobs from London to other parts of the country.\u201d However, the BBC said it did not accept the findings of the report, while the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said the report was \u201cflawed\u201d. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are surprised by this report as all other independent assessments of the BBC\u2019s move to Salford have recognised the considerable benefit of the move, not just to the immediate MediaCityUK area, but to the wider economy of Greater Manchester and the north west.\u201d Mike Blackburn, chair of the Greater Manchester Local Enterprise Partnership, added: \u201cQuite frankly a report that says the BBC has not had a positive impact on Greater Manchester is ridiculous. \u201cThe report is flawed, is far too narrow and fails to calculate the wider economic impact of jobs and the GVA (gross value added) of direct and non-direct BBC employees and their families and the benefit to the wider economy.\u201d Channel 4 declined to comment on what the report could mean for its own relocation. However, a spokesperson for the government\u2019s Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: \u201cThe government wants Channel 4 to do more to drive economic growth outside London, stimulate regional creative industries, and better serve audiences around the UK. The government has consulted on how best Channel 4 can do this, and we will set out next steps in due course.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
