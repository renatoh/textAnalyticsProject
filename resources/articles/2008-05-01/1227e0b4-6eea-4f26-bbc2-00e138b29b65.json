My date was with Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the young Mexican whose vocal ardour and dramatic intensity have singled him out as the successor to the venerable Placido Domingo; at the appointed time, a dinosaur turned up. No, not some lumbering relic of an extinct species like Pavarotti, but an actual saurian, admittedly made of plastic. Through the door poked the head of a triceratops, its jaws grinning as it chomped on a furry teddy bear. While it ate, the head emitted a jungly, rumbling growl. When the mask came off, I recognised Villaz\u00f3n, a madcap jester who has eyes like burning coals, eyebrows like scorched earth and hair that looks as if it might have been twisted into curls by red-hot tongs. He had spent the day rehearsing the Hamlet-like title role in Verdi's Don Carlos, the most eagerly awaited new production of the Royal Opera's season, sold out months in advance; that, he said, explained his impersonation of a prehistoric beast. 'Ah yes, it is the director's concept. Nicholas Hytner is setting the opera in Jurassic Park, not 16th-century Spain. Interesting, no?' Then a wild burst of laughter jolted him. 'OK, I am joking, I tell you why I wear this. It is because the fans stop me everywhere in the street wanting autographs and this frightens them away!' Another fit of giggles followed, after which, on his third try, Villaz\u00f3n, who siphons off surplus energy by clowning and spends his spare time scribbling caricatures, let slip the dull, domestic truth. He had picked up the mask at a novelty shop in Covent Garden and was taking it home as a bedtime present for one of his young sons. Before the dinosaur unmasked, I noticed that it was carrying a thick paperback. Most tenors have resonance cavities where their brains should be, but Villaz\u00f3n is a great reader and was immersed in The Goose Man, an untranslated novel by German expressionist Jakob Wassermann, which describes the travails of a misunderstood composer. The two accessories sum up his complexity: a child's mask on his head, an adult's weighty, frowningly obscure book in his hand. Villaz\u00f3n claims that novels help him to flesh out the inner lives of the sometimes vacuous operatic characters he has to embody. 'In books I discover the real human beings,' he said in 2006. 'In life, you often meet only the masks.' I met the mask first. But the face underneath the dinosaur's head is another kind of mask, elasticised when Villaz\u00f3n laughs or torn apart by anguish as he surrenders to the rage of Alfredo in La traviata and the sobbing misery of Rodolfo in La boh\u00e8me. When he sings, his head sometimes seems to disappear altogether, engulfed by a mouth that opens preternaturally wide to let out what he calls 'the cry of the unconscious - a continuous primal scream'. I had seen the layered disguises. Would I discover the real human being? The task, I found, was like trying to catch a whirlwind. Unstoppably loquacious in several languages and physically restless to the point of frenzy, Villaz\u00f3n is a self-transformer. His slim body and his thin skin are the cage for a menagerie of creatures as feral as that triceratops: a predatory libertine like the Duke in Verdi's Rigoletto, a crazed stalker like Don Jos\u00e9 in Bizet's Carmen, a morbid narcissist like the poet Lensky in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. The man who lets these alter egos inhabit him, and who voices their neuroses with such eloquence, must sometimes wonder who he actually is. Last summer, overcome by just that anxiety, Villaz\u00f3n cancelled his engagements for five months and retired to an island off the coast of Spain to brood about the forced pace of his career and the emotional self-expenditure it entailed. 'It was,' he told me, 'a physical and vocal collapse. Just before it happened, it was not me performing, it was my reflection. Somehow I wasn't there. My voice is a horse and it wanted to be ridden by a man, not a reflection.' He then treated that voice to a little exercise in mythological metamorphosis, extra evidence of his flair for changing himself. 'When it goes well, the man and the voice are one, like Centaur. And when it goes really well, the horse becomes Pegasus - he flies!' His arms raked the air in anticipation of take-off; Villaz\u00f3n always seems on the point of going through the roof. He is, conveniently enough, married to a psychologist and also has a trusted shrink in Mexico, whom he consults every week by telephone. He has often toyed with the idea of rounding up the operatic characters that are his multiple, optional selves and banging their heads together in a session of group therapy. The medical analogy breaks down, however, because opera is a sickness from which Villaz\u00f3n doesn't want to be cured. 'That's right, the theatre is not a doctor's office,' he said. 'The stage is a playground - a macabre playground, because it's where you set fantasies free, where the demons dance around like ghosts on the Day of the Dead in Mexico.' Villaz\u00f3n applies his knowledge of psychoanalysis to the roles he performs; but having uncovered the reasons for their perverse conduct, he does not restore them to sane, unoperatic normality. Instead he allows himself to be infected by a mania that the analyst would want to dispel. Don Carlos, for instance, is a Spanish Oedipus, defying his tyrannical father Philip II and making abject love to his stepmother. Villaz\u00f3n filled in the emotional history of Carlos for me - his guilt at having killed the mother who died giving birth to him, his fear of a lethal father whose pastime was signing death warrants - and illustrated the schizophrenia of the music Verdi wrote for him. 'Listen to the way he is - sometimes very soft, pleading, lyrical, then he suddenly explodes with craziness.' He crooned a few honeyed bars into my ear, then erupted in a spitting fury that I tried not to take personally. Before I had the chance to recover, he was lying on the floor, acting out the epileptic fits from which Carlos suffered. His eyes popped, his chest heaved, his breath came in rasping spasms; I was about to call for help when he laughed to exorcise this particular devil, jumped back into his seat, and talked about the tricky end of the opera, in which a spurious miracle saves Carlos from the Inquisition. 'When I did this opera in Amsterdam, the director refused to stage the miracle, so Carlos committed suicide in front of his father. I don't know yet what Nick Hytner wants me to do. But I have to say I love to kill myself!' That is actually Villaz\u00f3n's vocation: wearing himself out on stage, shedding blood as he pours forth that molten, plaintive voice. 'I have to give the audience 100 per cent,' he said. 'I can do it no other way.' At lunchtime the day before, launching his new CD Cielo e Mar in a bar at the Royal Opera House, he treated a few dozen guests to three alternately ecstatic and tormented arias, sung with a force that made me fear for the chandelier above his head, then made an equally impassioned speech in which he celebrated music as 'the true nourishment of the spirit'. Corporate honchos from Rolex, with whom he has an endorsement deal, swilled their champagne uneasily: they were there to shift merchandise, not save souls. 'We are living in the decadence of the interior life,' Villaz\u00f3n went on, adding a brief tirade against text messaging and the instant gratification of consumerist whims. 'We feel empty, so we fill up with stupid movies, or with food.' My hand, extended to grasp a passing canap\u00e9, guiltily retracted. 'But art opens our chests,' he continued. 'Art is a scalpel. Of course it can be hurtful. To open the chest you must make a wound, but that wound is a door. It shows the things that live inside a person - what makes it possible for us to jump into the sea or up to the clouds.' Once again, his rhetoric achieved lift-off, as he reached up towards the tinkling, agitated chandelier. No wonder he has described his wife, Lucia, as a necessary anchorage, tethering him like gravity: 'If I am the kite, she is the cord that keeps it close to the earth.' She must need both her hands to tug down her volatile husband, who is as aeronautical as his own high notes. Villaz\u00f3n's messianic earnestness startled his listeners at the launch party. 'People said to me that they never hear speeches like that,' he told me later. 'Usually it's a just a few jokes so they can go back to drinking the champagne. But I meant it all, every word.' He may have meant more than he was saying out loud, because during his months off he questioned his conscience about the hucksterism that keeps classical music in business. His disc of duets with incendiary Russian soprano Anna Netrebko had a booklet in which they were photographed hugging, romping hand in hand and tickling one another's toes. Sex sells, and the recording company needed to unload CDs and DVDs of La traviata and La boh\u00e8me; Netrebko and Villaz\u00f3n insisted that their partnership was confined to the theatre, though the denials sounded teasingly coy. Last July in London, Netrebko began an affair with Uruguayan baritone Erwin Schrott, by whom she is now pregnant. Villaz\u00f3n's period of medical rest began soon afterwards, and he and Netrebko have not sung together since (though they are contracted to make joint appearances at the Metropolitan Opera and eventually, in Massenet's Manon, at Covent Garden). He looked back ruefully on those prurient efforts to brand them as a couple. 'A story was told though pictures about me and Anna that was not true or correct,' he said. For once, his rubbery, animated face had a solemn fixity. He is an idealist, who now knows that he can expect to be disillusioned or, perhaps, betrayed. In his incautious, almost infantile candour, Villaz\u00f3n is a kind of holy fool or, perhaps, a knight riding off on an absurd crusade, preaching his musical gospel to an unworthy congregation of marketers, publicists and gossiping hacks. It was he who mentioned Don Quixote, the literary character who represents the interconnection of nobility and nonsense, aspiration and disaster. 'Living is a Quixotesque thing,' he said. 'We know we are going to die, we fail at whatever we try to do. But this is what gives us a reason to continue.' Growing up in Mexico City, Villaz\u00f3n intended to devote himself to a calling more sacred than the erotically obsessive art of opera. He studied in a seminary and was a candidate for the priesthood. Before his ordination, he went on an Easter retreat to Popocat\u00e9petl, the quiescent volcano outside the city. He climbed to the top, perhaps expecting to hear God boom megaphonically from the crater or erupt in fire as on Sinai. The deity, however, was not in residence. 'Nothing happened for me. And I began to feel sorry for God - I understood that he needs us, not the other way round. So I went back down the volcano through the snow, and I felt the wind, and I looked at the village at the bottom and gradually I saw the people who lived there. Finally, I had this vision of Lucia, who was to become my wife. That revealed what my dream ought to be; to enter the monastery would be hiding. I just wandered away from Christianity - though I still admire Jesus as a man, a socialist maybe.' Or perhaps a singer, who made audible the distress of those he comforted. I recalled Villaz\u00f3n's claim that art performs open-heart surgery, baring our innards: had he been volunteering for the stigmata? Vaulting ahead of me, he denounced imperial Rome for its corruption of Christianity. 'When the Emperor Constantine made it all official, it became the power machine that Jesus fought against. I think religion is a mistake that's now behind us. It was an invention - an invention of the rich, just like opera. I still have faith, but in other things. I believe in a force inside us, not in heaven. People who can afford opera tickets sometimes go for the wrong reasons, and fall asleep when the music starts. I hope that in Don Carlos we will make them cry with joy and sadness. Why not have faith in that? Or in a great violinist - someone who shits and pisses like me, but when he takes up his instrument he grows extra fingers and can do things that are extraordinary? Someone like that is flesh and blood, but he is also spirit.' Physiology blends with metaphysics in Villaz\u00f3n's thinking. He went on to rhapsodise about the division of cells and outlined his belief in creative evolution, which - with opera as its chosen agent - is showing us how to reconcile body and soul. 'I realised two things during those months when I was not singing,' he said. 'One is that what I have to give to opera is unique, just as my colleagues have their own unique contributions to make. The second is that opera can get on perfectly fine without me. The performances I cancelled took place with other singers; evolution continued. I am only a voice among all the other voices, like in Verdi's Requiem.' For a moment, I fancied I could hear a celestial choir making the sky resonate. Villaz\u00f3n, however, is a tenor, capable of surmounting that massed ensemble with a high C or a B flat. Without pausing for breath, he described the 'nucleus of fire' he has inside him and lamented the way it was muffled and dampened by the 'watery sphere' that comes with success. He found his calling on a volcano; his period of retirement enabled him to reignite the blaze. I reminded him that he once told a German interviewer that he felt 'a little like Prometheus, who challenges the gods and steals fire from heaven'. 'Oh shit,' he moaned, 'it was so pretentious of me to say that! No, what happened last year was different: I recovered my humanity.' Despite this modest attempt to ground himself, Villaz\u00f3n is a human being with a gift that seems superhuman, as well as a fondness for pretending to be a subhuman dinosaur. I hope that he tends the fire carefully and doesn't let it burn out. The life story Early Life Born 1972 in Mexico City.
