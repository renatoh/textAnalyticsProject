The state is the first in Australia to sign up to the Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s signature global trade and infrastructure program, earning a rebuke from the prime minister, Scott Morrison. The four-page memorandum of understanding states Victoria and China will work together to \u201cinject new momentum\u201d to achieve common development and promote connectivity of policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people. Businesses and organisations on both sides will develop long-term partnerships, the document says. The parties will enhance policy cooperation and \u201cunimpeded trade\u201d. The agreement is not legally binding and expires in five years. Labor insiders have been quick to play down the agreement as being a \u201cseries of motherhood statements\u201d that doesn\u2019t commit to anything specific. But the Australian Strategic Policy Institute director, Peter Jennings, is alarmed that Victoria may have overstepped the mark, after the federal government declined to sign up. \u201cMy take on it is it was wrong for a state government to sign something like this \u2013 it might even be unconstitutional,\u201d Jennings told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt may not be tested, of course, but it strikes me as something the Victorians would have been wiser not to agree to.\u201d The agreement could be viewed as a form of inappropriate \u201cpolitical interference\u201d by China, he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get the answer they wanted from one jurisdiction \u2026 so they went to another one, really with the effect of undermining the federal government\u2019s position,\u201d Jennings said. He said he hoped other state leaders would be discouraged from copying Victoria. \u201cFrankly, there is a bit of a trend at the moment for state leaders to go over to China with dollar signs rolling in their eyes, with how much money they can make from engagement,\u201d he said. An Australian National University academic, Prof Rory Medcalf, agreed the agreement could be \u201cpushing the boundaries\u201d on Australia\u2019s constitution. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the point of the whole exercise, in terms of the interests of the state of Victoria and the Australian national interest,\u201d Medcalf told the Guardian Australia. \u201cIt contains an uncritical endorsement of everything that occurs under the rubric of Belt and Road. It does hand a propaganda win to China in its own differences with the Australian government over this issue.\u201d The federal government and the opposition have kept the initiative at arm\u2019s length, saying they will look at cooperating on projects on merit. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, insists that the agreement makes economic sense for his state. \u201cThis new Australian-first agreement sums up everything we have achieved with China over the past four years \u2013 it means more trade and more Victorian jobs and an even stronger relationship with China,\u201d Andrews said last month. He was the only Australian state leader to attend China\u2019s Belt and Road international summit in May last year. Belt and Road is a vast Chinese infrastructure plan to connect China via the ancient Silk Road land route and sea routes with Eurasia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe in an attempt to boost trade and economic growth while cutting transit time for goods. The scheme has attracted international criticism for China\u2019s use of \u201cdebtbook diplomacy\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
