A year later she became her country\u2019s darling again as she ended a compelling long jump competition with a silver medal. The Russian\u2019s leap of 7.00m was a season\u2019s best but it was agonisingly short of the American Brittney Reese\u2019s 7.02m that brought her a fourth world championship gold medal. \u201cI\u2019m really glad and I\u2019m really happy,\u201d said the 26-year-old Klishina, who is one of 19 Russians competing as neutral athletes in London. \u201cThis is my first medal from a world championships and, for me, it\u2019s my most important result. I didn\u2019t jump seven metres for six years and I just missed those longer jumps.\u201d She was not allowed to wear Russian clothing or celebrate with her country\u2019s flag, due to IAAF regulations, but her smile at the end of the competition showed her delight. \u201cI wanted to show this result in an Olympic Games but I did not have a chance with the whole situation around me,\u201d she added. \u201cNow it was the right time, at a world championships, to jump this. I had no nerves \u2013 for the first time in my life. It was good for me and I could be focused on just my result.\u201d The top four athletes were separated by only six centimetres, with the American Tianna Bartoletta taking bronze in 6.97m, one centimetre ahead of Ivana Spanovic. Britain\u2019s Lorraine Ugen, who had been talked up as a medal chance, was frustrated after fouling four of her first five attempts and ending up in fifth place with 6.72m, the same placing she earned in 2015. \u201cI wanted to come out here and get a medal,\u201d she said. \u201cThrowing away so many jumps by fouling and not getting everything together is disappointing. My runway just wasn\u2019t quite clicking.\u201d There was more disappointment for Britain in the men\u2019s hammer where Nick Miller could finish only sixth in the final behind the Polish gold medallist, Pawel Fajdek, despite a throw of 77.31m which was close to his personal best. Better news for the home nation came when Lynsey Sharp successfully appealed against what looked a harsh disqualification in the women\u2019s 800m semi-finals when she was accused of pulling back the American Charlene Lipsey. She qualified for Sunday\u2019s final as a fastest loser. But there was frustration for Adele Tracey and Shelane Oskan-Clarke, who both missed out after finished sixth in their respective heats. In the semi-finals of the men\u2019s 1500m Chris O\u2019Hare looked to have plenty in the tank in making it through to Sunday\u2019s final after finishing fourth. \u201cIt\u2019s the most deeply rooted confidence I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked with my psychologist at the start of the year to develop what we call Matthew Centrowitz confidence \u2013 confidence beyond belief. Previously it\u2019s been superficial.\u201d There was chaos in the women\u2019s 3,000m steeplechase when the Kenyan Beatrice Chepkoech forgot to take the water jump early in the race and had to run back. The mistake cost her any chance of a podium place and the race was won by the Olympic bronze medallist, Emma Coburn, a 33-1 underdog, who powered away to become the first US woman to win a global steeplechase championship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
