The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts avoided the tie that had Russell Crowe\u2019s The Water Diviner and the horror flick The Babadook sharing the top honour at the last Aacta awards in January. But while Miller\u2019s return to the road beat the box office hit The Dressmaker to the academy\u2019s vote, Jocelyn Moorhouse\u2019s period drama still took home five of its 12 nominations, including the people\u2019s choice award for favourite Australian film and three acting nods: best actress for Kate Winslet and best supporting actor and actress for Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. Michael Caton, celebrated for his comedic turn in 1997\u2019s The Castle, was named best actor for his cast-against-type role in Last Cab to Darwin. \u201cComedies never win best actor,\u201d he told journalists afterwards, \u201cit\u2019s always drama,\u201d before thanking God for this opportunity \u2013 if God were a man named Jeremy Sims (the film\u2019s director). The biggest television winner was Peter Allen: The Boy Next Door, a biopic starring Joel Jackson as the older Allen and 14-year-old Ky Baldwin as his younger self. Both actors were rewarded, and the biopic took home best mini-series or drama. The Aacta for best television actress went to Pamela Rabe for her chilling turn as Joan \u201cThe Freak\u201d Ferguson in Wentworth, making it two for the actor who also picked up a Helpmann award this year. Also rewarded was ABC\u2019s Glitch, a boon for its star Patrick Brammall, whose film Ruben Guthrie didn\u2019t get a look-in in the film categories. Holding the Man, directed by Neil Armfield, was also overlooked despite multiple nominations. Cate Blanchett, tipped for a second Academy Award for best actress for Todd Haynes\u2019 Carol, took home the Longford Lyell lifetime achievement award, joking that it was payback time for the years she had spent as an Aacta ambassador. Directors including Bruce Beresford, Sam Raimi, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu were among those who paid video tribute to the actor \u2013 as well as Gillian Armstrong in person, who recalled auditioning Blanchett as a Nida graduate. She was presented with the award by her friends Hugo Weaving, who paid tribute to the young Melburnian drama student once known as \u201cCathy Blanket\u201d, and Richard Roxburgh, who praised an actor who always gave her all. Amid tears \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve become one of those ridiculous people who cries, it\u2019s just a fucking award\u201d \u2013 Blanchett praised the Australian film industry as as \u201cgem\u201d and applauded its moves toward gender equality. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic Aactas is coming into the 21st century,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we just get on and do stuff, female achievement gets swept under the carpet, so it\u2019s extraordinary to achieve this.\u201d Presenters on the night included Mel Gibson, Radha Mitchell and Rachel Griffiths, but on the red carpet, crowd excitement was reserved for the reality show winners Bindi Irwin of Dancing in the Stars, newly crowned X Factor singer Cyrus and Oddball the dog, star of the Aacta-nominated film of the same name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
