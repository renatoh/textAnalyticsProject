We will not suffer the Trinidadian blanket that exposed a lack of creativity and cunning, nor have the difficulty of adjustment that led to our second-half retreat in the heat against Paraguay. It is time to make a statement in the competition. Rarely does a side that shows early brilliance maintain that form and, normally, a steadily improving team instead hits the heights towards the end of the last week. Otherwise those selecting Argentina as potential winners (including myself) could collect their winnings now. It will not be as easy as that. Grit, solidarity and consistency allied to skill and luck will provide the winners. It was Sweden's never-say-die attitude that finally nailed Paraguay with Freddie Ljungberg's last-minute header. England's persistence saved embarrassment against T&amp;T. What the third game must give us is a chance to rekindle form and approach the second phase with more confidence. We must cement partnerships and relationships within the team. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard haven't yet progressed the midfield axis as much as hoped for, but we should not now be experimenting with shape or positional changes unless forced to by injury. Let's play the best players. Systems only start the game. After that it is down to a flexible interchange where players cover for one another in a compact team. Speed and accuracy of pass and making space by using the width are essential. I am pleased Michael Owen partners Wayne Rooney. With a big man there is always the temptation to hit the deeper or diagonal ball too early. Only David Beckham and Gerrard play the deep diagonal with the required pace and accuracy. Peter Crouch's main plus to the team has not been his box work but his linking play. We must look for the two outstanding forwards of the last few years to play in unison. They have contrasting styles, Rooney an indefatigable powerhouse with running skills, Owen slightly laidback, a cheetah waiting to pounce. No midfield linking or chasing back from him. He waits, saves energy to strike. At his best he finishes with aplomb. At his worst, he can cut a forlorn figure rarely making decoy runs off the ball. Against Olof Mellberg and Teddy Lucic, ageing centre-backs of over 140 caps, I expect us to play on the deck and sharply, looking to drag them close together and working the ball with one-twos and imaginative movements to get behind them. Against Paraguay, Erik Edman and Niclas Alexandersson, Sweden's full-backs, were cautious coverers rather than raiders, so spinning into channels may not be the way forward. Instead angled passes into feet will be a pleasure to Rooney, who can touch off and spin. If Mellberg doesn't get tight and is worried about the space behind, Rooney must attack him with the ball. Lucic is 33 and Owen will relish running beyond his man. Against Paraguay, Tobias Linderoth and Kim Kallstrom had to cover a big midfield space as Ljungberg and Christian Wilhelmsson worked widish. If that is repeated England will have room to play, allowing our defenders and midfield to pass the ball into Owen and Rooney's feet. England need to get back to good values and forget systems. No system of play can disguise a lack of ability to control and pass early and accurately, move into and make space for others, and make correct decisions. That is the basis of a good side: team before self. England can beat Sweden and should think positively. Self-belief is the key."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
