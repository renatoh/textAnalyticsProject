Measured by the slightly looser gauge in her imagination, though, Jones is a colossus, a towering church-and-steeple of a human being. She\u2019s got a basketballer\u2019s reach and a bodyguard\u2019s doorway-filling bulk. Even in flat-soled shoes, this 36-year-old can go around plucking stranded cats out of trees. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve always felt bigger and taller than I am.\u201d In the past few years especially, the actor has made good use of this inside-outside differential. Whether it was playing the pioneering American judge, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in 2018\u2019s On the Basis of Sex, or earning an Oscar nomination as Jane Hawking, Stephen\u2019s formidable first wife, in 2015\u2019s The Theory of Everything, Jones has had an instinctive sense for the pathos and humour in characters whose physical slightness tends to trick others into overlooking them. In a Star Wars movie, 2016\u2019s Rogue One, she played a watchful and almost childlike guerrilla who ultimately tough-nutted past dozens of baddies to bring down an army. In her coming movie, The Aeronauts, she plays a 19th-century balloonist \u2013 a figure of fun to the scientists and flight enthusiasts of Victorian London, until she has to rescue one of them from death at 37,000ft. Jones meets me for lunch in a pub in north London. She is early, and pumped for some roast chicken. When our meals arrive she sets about eating and talking at an equally brisk clip. Although this can lead to accidents (she points out a stain on her sweatshirt), Jones is a cool bean and has that performer\u2019s knack, just about inexplicable to me, of chatting away fluently even after forking in a mouthful of drumstick meat. She\u2019s interesting and eloquent about her job, stiffer when it comes to talking about herself and her personal life. First we talk about the wider world, which seems, most weeks, to be falling to pieces. \u201cThere was that old-fashioned idea, years and years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cof a movie star who was this godlike being who never deigned to talk about anything mortal. But that\u2019s long gone.\u201d All for the better, she thinks. \u201cI\u2019m a constant news-checker. You can\u2019t not be, now. There\u2019s such chaos in the world. It seems to be our duty to be informed, to be abreast of things. Particularly in my work, now, I\u2019m not shy of things that have a strong ideology, that are political.\u201d Her Ginsburg biopic had an obvious liberal bent. The politics are more subtle in the new film The Aeronauts, directed by Tom Harper, written by Jack Thorne and co-starring Eddie Redmayne. He plays James Glaisher, one of the world\u2019s first meteorologists, a Victorian scientist who hoped to better understand our weather and our climate. In his studies of the upper atmosphere, he took the first steps towards understanding what damage we were doing up there, even then. A timely story to tell, Jones suggests. I ask her what she makes of the current political situation. \u201cUh. I\u2019m pretty disappointed, to be honest. It\u2019s been sort of devastating, the last few years. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d She recalls the time she spent in the company of Justice Ginsburg, becoming close to the 86-year-old while preparing to portray the older woman on screen. \u201cThat was life-changing for me,\u201d she says. \u201cSpending time with her. Getting to know her well. She has such integrity. And, particularly now, when we look around at public figures, when their integrity seems to have been left very, very far behind, and it seems as if everyone is acting out of this horrific personal interest\u2026\u201d She widens her arms, a gesture of vague despair that I take to mean: oh, for one or two more Ginsburgs. On the Basis of Sex, which partly focused on the relationship between Ginsburg and her husband Marty, played by Armie Hammer, got a lukewarm reception when it came out last year. Jones remembers the months spent promoting the movie around America, not always to the most receptive of audiences. \u201cI felt there was an ingrained sexism, at certain points, in response to the film. Even now it\u2019s hard to put out a film like that into the world, about female triumph, female success.\u201d She remembers the amazed reaction people had to Marty especially, who took on a secondary role in the marriage, better to support Ruth\u2019s ambitions. Up to that point, in a varied screen career, Jones had played opposite monsters, witches, a long-dead Peter Cushing who was digitally revived by animators for her Star Wars film, superheroes and aliens. But it was Marty Ginsburg who audiences refused to believe in. \u201cI was asked: \u2018Who is this man? Could he possibly exist? Is he a fantasy?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. Maybe change happens slowly. But it\u2019s hard at times not to get disheartened.\u201d Jones was born in a suburb of Birmingham, to parents who met while working on a local newspaper. They separated when she was young, and Jones has since said that the example of living with a working single mother helped instil in her a definite work ethic. Jones joined a drama group at 10 and got her first paid gig at 13, in an adventure movie, The Treasure Seekers, alongside a young Keira Knightley. They filmed during the school holidays. \u201cI remember liking how we were taken seriously, despite being young.\u201d At 15, she joined the cast of The Archers (playing Emma Carter in the radio soap until she was in her mid-20s) and put in the work while in secondary school as a magic-endowed school bully, Ethel, in a BBC adaptation of the Worst Witch books. Over lunch we talk about some of the complications associated with kids who take on adult jobs. Growing up too quickly. Missing out on parts of childhood. Jones cuts in on my examples. \u201cYou\u2019re asking, did I have the Judy Garland experience? On the uppers and downers?\u201d Sure, I say. How Judy were you? \u201cI was quite low on the Judy scale. Partly because my parents were strong about having an education, and keeping school going alongside acting. And partly because it felt like a hobby then. It was fun. It wasn\u2019t Judy. It wasn\u2019t a grind.\u201d Jones went to Oxford and studied English. Her freshers\u2019 week was unluckily timed. She had just done an ad for zit medication, which was nationally broadcast. \u201cI was one of two girls in a bedroom, talking about a guy named Rob. We bounced around, fell back on the bed, dreamed about this guy named Rob. And then we used some face wipes.\u201d As an undergrad she appeared in some earnest, bad student plays and, after graduating, moved to the southeast to set about auditioning for real. \u201cI look back on that time fondly. But I remember it being hectic. Chaotic. Everything up in the air. You got sent reams and reams of scenes to learn, for auditions that were always in Soho, and which you would never get. I remember always bumping into the same actors who were going through the system.\u201d She reels off the names: Carey Mulligan, Andrea Riseborough, Eddie Redmayne, Andrew Garfield, Tom Hardy\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019d see each other constantly.\u201d One by one, like fireworks, these other careers began to spark and take off. \u201cWe were all going for it. So you were disappointed if you didn\u2019t get something, when someone else did. It was funny. People would have these moments and suddenly go stratospheric. I guess I started to realise that everyone has their own unique selling points.\u201d When I ask Jones what her own unique selling point is, she raises an eyebrow, ironic. Isn\u2019t it obvious? \u201cMy height. My huge stature!\u201d She apes the voice of an imaginary casting director: \u201cShe took our breath away, that tall one. We\u2019ve got to get that tall girl back.\u201d That gang of Soho auditionees, with careers that one by one took off \u2013 was there rivalry between them? Is there still? Jones tilts her head. \u201cWe\u2019re all still friends. I\u2019m always interested in what choices they make. \u2018Ooh. That is interesting. They\u2019re doing a play now are they?\u2019 It\u2019s healthy competition. And it\u2019s nice to feel hungry.\u201d In the late 2000s Jones was in a bunch of TV shows: Austen adaptation, David Morrissey drama, Doctor Who cameo. She appeared in two Michael Grandage plays in the West End, and Julie Taymor cast her as Miranda in a Helen Mirren-led film of The Tempest. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant made her a co-lead in their curious, whimsical romcom from 2010, Cemetery Junction. The film that eventually cut through was an American indie, Like Crazy, a Sundance darling directed by Drake Doremus that came out in 2011. Jones played a British exchange student who fell in love with a Californian, played by Anton Yelchin. Years later, Jones\u2019s co-star Yelchin was killed in a car accident outside his home, at 27. When I ask about him, Jones loses her fluency. \u201cI mean, it takes time, to get to a point\u2026 to find some hope in some of this stuff. I think all decisions in life become more meaningful through grief. You think: \u2018How lucky I am.\u2019 Because it\u2019s\u2026 Because we\u2019re all just here in the balance.\u201d She\u2019s seems a little teary-eyed. Maybe I\u2019m imagining it. In any case we leave the subject there. There is a certain line in Jones\u2019s head, the stuff in life that\u2019s up for discussion, and the stuff that\u2019s not. She will squirm as this line is approached. She\u2019ll prod at her food. Talking about intimacies with a voice recorder running is, plainly, agony to her. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bumpy ride, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m an instinctively open person. I\u2019m used to being quite expressive. But I think, ultimately, you\u2019re just trying to think about people in your life who haven\u2019t chosen the public eye.\u201d Jones recently got married to her boyfriend, the British director Charles Guard. After the wedding, pictures of the ceremony were harvested from her guests\u2019 social media accounts and published in a few tabloids. \u201cTo an extent you develop a level of detachment from yourself,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSeeing images of yourself all the time, you have to, in order not to get too neurotic. But I think in terms of family and friends and partners, you need to protect them.\u201d One friendship she is eager to discuss is that with Redmayne. The pair were cast in The Theory of Everything in the summer of 2013. During the shoot the following autumn, Jones remembers, they developed an interesting method of motivating each other. When it was one of their turns for a close-up, the other would linger off-camera, hurling abuse. \u201cI would stand there, or he would, shouting horrific things, \u2018You\u2019re hopeless, you\u2019re never going to work again,\u2019 anything to get a response. Shooting gets monotonous. You do scenes over and over and over again. To try for something a little\u2026 spicier, it helps if someone is pushing you, provoking you.\u201d Jones says the pair repeated the same trick when they reteamed for The Aeronauts. Every day she and Redmayne would set out to ruin the other one\u2019s day, \u201cto get a fantastic close-up.\u201d When The Theory of Everything came out, both Jones and Redmayne were nominated for the big-deal best-acting awards \u2013 Oscars, Globes, Baftas, all of which Redmayne won. Jones missed out, beaten in every case by Julianne Moore for Still Alice. She remembers it, now, as a blurry, happy period of brilliant good luck. \u201cWhich at the time I totally took for granted. I thought it would happen in every film. \u2018See you on the next red carpet!\u2019 It\u2019s only afterwards you see how special it was. How unique, for a film to hit the zeitgeist.\u201d I ask Jones, what does an experience like that do to the ego? \u201cThe ego\u2026 swells. It can feel as if this film is the most important thing of the moment, and you lose a bit of perspective.\u201d They\u2019d been pushing and pushing to get to Oscar night on 22 February, she recalls, and on 23 February, Jones says, only exaggerating slightly, everybody moved on. \u201cThe whole thing ends. It feels like you start again. But that\u2019s the job. It\u2019s a carnival, it\u2019s a travelling show. The tent comes down. There\u2019s the constant excitement and adrenaline and next minute no one cares. You can see why actors in the past have had such horrific lives. Drugs. You have to have some stability that\u2019s already there in you. You have to be able to ground yourself \u2013 come home. Take time to let your ego un-swell.\u201d A few years have passed since then. Jones went on to helm the billion-dollar-grossing Star Wars film, Rogue One. She married. She played Justice Ginsburg. Recently she signed on to make a George Clooney-directed space movie, out next year. Right now she\u2019s back on the promotional circuit with Redmayne for The Aeronauts. A winter release date, for a film like this, would tend to suggest there are studio hopes for the big awards. Who knows? Jones says: \u201cYou start to realise you have peaks and troughs. It\u2019s an undulating experience.\u201d She\u2019s inclined to go by the theory: \u201cHave a care for what you put out in the world, and then let the world do what it will.\u201d We\u2019ve finished our lunch and reflexively we do that ugly, uncomfortable thing in times of Big News \u2013 we check our phones for updates. Jones says she\u2019s been thinking about Stephen Hawking a lot, in these times of political upheaval, all the disagreements and double-talk. Jones befriended the physicist during the course of making The Theory of Everything and when Hawking died last year, she attended the funeral. She has found herself wondering what he would make of it all. \u201cHe was such an important voice,\u201d she says, standing up. \u201cI miss it. I don\u2019t mean his voice-voice. His voice went, of course, he had a mechanical voice. I mean, I miss his articulacy.\u201d His reason, I suggest. \u201cYeah. I miss his truthfulness.\u201d She shrugs. Gathers her stuff. The world carries on doing what it will.
