Moffett's plan that four provincial teams based around Llanelli, Cardiff, Newport and Wrexham would represent Wales in cross-border tournaments next season with players contracted to the WRU wrongfooted the nine premier clubs last week. They drew up an alternative plan yesterday which they intended to present to Moffett tomorrow but that showdown has been postponed after the clubs agreed that there should be five club-based professional sides but fell out over who they should be. \"We believe the five should be club-based because the provincial model would alienate supporters and have little commercial appeal,\" said one club official last night. \"There is no agreement on who the five should be and we will be meeting again on December 19. We need to be united in this, otherwise we are doomed.\" Five of the clubs - Llanelli, Swansea, Cardiff, Pontypridd and Newport - have formed an alliance and collectively want to absorb the other four: Neath, Bridgend, Ebbw Vale and Caerphilly. Neath and Bridgend last week joined forces and announced they intended to merge next season to play in the Celtic League and the Heineken Cup. Under proposals put forward yesterday Neath would link up with Swansea while Bridgend would join up with Cardiff or Pontypridd, but the meeting broke up with nothing decided. The issue is due to be decided in the new year by the 239 member clubs of the WRU and the indications are that they will back the provincial model and turn their backs on the premier sides. But the clubs, who under Moffett's plan would continue as separate entities in a 12-strong semi-professional premier division, argue that fans would rather watch them than provinces. \u00b7 Cambridge beat Oxford 15-13 in the Varsity match at Twickenham yesterday, their first victory since 1998. Simon Frost scored two early tries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
