Meoni suffered a fatal heart attack today after crashing on the 11th stage of the gruelling event. The news comes 24 hours after Spanish rival Jose Manuel Perez died in hospital from injuries sustained on the rally last week. Meoni, who was married with two children, won the Dakar rally in 2001 and 2002 and had said this race would be his last. He was second in the motorcycle standings after the 10th stage. The 47-year-old, known by Italians as 'The African', crashed a third of the way through the 685-km stage between Atar in Mauritania and Mali's Kiffa. Paramedics treated him for 45 minutes at the scene of the accident but were unable to revive him. Ironically, as one of the elder statesmen of the sport, Meoni had been asked for his thoughts on the death of Perez on Monday. He told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \"This shows the ugly side of the race. The Dakar rally is fascinating, it's part of our passion, but there are certain things you wish would never happen.\" More than a dozen competitors have died on the desert event, in which drivers speed over Sahara dunes, since it was first held 26 years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
