The absence of Mark Lewis-Francis due to injury leaves Chambers as the fastest man in the field this season by 0.06sec, but he will be aware of Francis Obikwelu, the Nigerian making his debut for Portugal. Triple jump (Thursday) In potentially the event of the championships, 36-year-old Jonathan Edwards will try to remain a member of the grand slam club he joined only last week when he won the Commonwealth title. His team-mate Phillips Idowu and Christian Olsson of Sweden are his main rivals. 400m (Thursday) Daniel Caines just missed a medal in Manchester but will hope to succeed Iwan Thomas as champion in Munich. The race looks to be between the Birmingham runner and the local favourite Ingo Schultz, a former marathon runner turned sprinter who tops the European rankings with a best time of 44.97sec. 200m (Friday) Marlon Devonish, Darren Campbell and Christian Malcolm will seek to repeat the clean sweep achieved in Budapest in 1998. But they face a stiff challenge from Konstantinos Kenteris, the Olympic and world champion, and Obikwelu, the 1999 world bronze medallist. 400m hurdles (Friday) Chris Rawlinson was the only Englishman to win two golds in Manchester: the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay. He has beaten all his main European rivals this season, but faces tough opposition from former world champions Stephane Diagana of France and Fabrizio Mori of Italy. 110m hurdles (Saturday) Colin Jackson is seeking a record fourth consecutive title having not lost at the championships since 1990. Stanislavs Olijars of Latvia, like Jackson, has run 13.15sec this year and is likely to be his biggest rival for the gold. 4x100m relay (Sunday) As long as they get the baton round, no-one should beat a rejuvenated British side. WOMEN 10,000m (tonight) Paula Radcliffe is in such outstanding form that the question is not so much will she win but by how much? Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan is reportedly in the best shape of her life, but Radcliffe fears Portugal's 1996 Olympic champion Fernanda Ribeiro. Triple Jump (Saturday) Ashia Hansen is displaying a new-found competitive toughness, demonstrated brilliantly by her last-round victory in the Commonwealth Games. Hansen is ranked top of the world with her Manchester jump of 14.86m, but will fear the Russian trio led by Yelena Oleynikova. 1500m (Sunday) Helen Pattinson and Kelly Holmes are ranked in the top four in Europe but the biggest threat will surely come from Gabriela Szabo, the tiny Romanian with the rocket finish who is running in this event instead of the 5000m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
