Don't be", "bodyText": "Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, who endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president earlier this week, has always been honest about her beliefs and background. When she challenged incumbent Democrat Mike Capuano last year, she didn\u2019t shy from the \u201cKennedy Democrat\u201d label. She told Politico that although she was only 44, \u201cif politics is like dog years, you know, I\u2019m probably 80 right now.\u201d Pressley wasn\u2019t an insurgent plucked from obscurity, after all. In her early 20s, she was an intern and later staffer to Congressman Joseph Kennedy II. After that she became a senior aide to John Kerry and served for nearly a decade on Boston\u2019s city council. During that time she charted a careful course, building up support among her party\u2019s mainstream by campaigning for figures like former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and not rocking the boat. Not all of this is necessarily a bad thing: we might admonish the behavior of our political establishment, but experience is a useful thing if you\u2019re administering a state. And John F Kennedy? Not a favorite of this socialist, but pretty popular among Americans at large. Yet after beating Capuano \u2013 a longtime Congressional Progressive Caucus member, Iraq war opponent, and Medicare for All advocate \u2013 Pressley was lumped in by the media with leftwing congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. Together they were labeled \u201cthe Squad.\u201d Their (relative) youthfulness, their non-white ethnicities, and the fact that they all received backing from the Justice Democrats were obvious factors. So was the fact that the four had all been subject to racist attacks from President Trump. But despite friendship and a shared opposition to the ugly forces of right-populism, Pressley stood out from the rest of the group. She was the only one of the four, for example, to vote for a congressional resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement this summer. At the time, she said: \u201cI am pro-Palestinian and I am pro-Israeli. I am really sick and tired of our buying into this idea that we have to make these binary choices.\u201d It was a statement of centrist equivocation \u2013 between oppressed and oppressor \u2013 that could have been uttered by Nancy Pelosi. Though Pressley stood firm on other important issues, such as opposing June\u2019s border funding bill, one need only look at her views during the 2016 Democratic primary to see her careful political instincts at work: she endorsed Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders back then, not even picking the path of neutrality embraced by Elizabeth Warren. At the time, she even said that Clinton, unlike Sanders, \u201cknows plans without price tags are simply pandering.\u201d This was the kind of anti-populist messaging that, echoed by her fellow Clinton surrogates, helped spell doom in the 2016 general election. With rhetoric like that, perhaps the story that the media should be telling this week isn\u2019t about Pressley breaking with the rest of the Squad to endorse Warren over Bernie, but her evolving to the point that she would risk endorsing Warren over frontrunner Joe Biden. But the real reason I\u2019m interested in Pressley is that she\u2019s a perfect illustration of what happens when we project radical ideas on to people just because of who their enemies happen to be or because of what they look like. Ayanna Pressley is a Democrat who, like many others, is slowly inching leftward. Yet when she says, referring to the Squad, that \u201cwe are not a monolith. We don\u2019t land in the same place on every vote,\u201d she seems to be completely ignored. Let\u2019s stop doing that, and accept that people who are trailblazers might not all be blazing the same path, and that we don\u2019t have to necessarily support them. I knew, for example, that my project was a very different one than Pressley\u2019s when I read an interview where she said her goal was to avoid a \u201cnarrative of binary choices. Are you insider or outsider? Are you privileged or poor?\u201d That\u2019s the opposite of what the emerging New Left is and ought to be doing \u2013 naming enemies, politicizing issues, creating polarizations, all to push the kind of change that can improve millions of lives. Pressley will be an ally in many of these struggles, but out of respect for her own beliefs and tactics, let\u2019s stop conflating her vision with ours.
