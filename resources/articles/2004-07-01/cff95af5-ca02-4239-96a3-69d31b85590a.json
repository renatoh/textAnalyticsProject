Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic was initially banned for two years after failing a dope test for nandrolone, but was later cleared after the ATP said it could not be sure its own trainers had not handed out contaminated electrolytes. Six other players, who have all remained anonymous, were similarly let off. However, it has since been established that the ATP trainers were not culpable, although the source of the nandrolone has never been discovered. Britain's Greg Rusedski, who tested positive for the same steroid last summer, was also cleared of any doping offence by an independent tribunal earlier this year, basing his defence on the fact that the seven other players were exonerated. The Wada review, published yesterday, did not include his case. As well as the eight positives, there have now been more than 50 elevated test readings, with a further 23 this year. Wada praised the ATP for its continued efforts to establish the source, but has advised handing over the process to an independent scientific body. \"The ATP is in an awkward position [as] an association of players who effectively own and run the organisation and, on the other hand, are trying to enforce the sanctions,\" a Wada statement said. It added that this might be perceived to be a \"conflict of interests\" - a view that may ultimately lead to the ATP relinquishing its anti-doping programme to an outside body or the International Tennis Federation. Mark Miles, the chief executive officer of the ATP, is thought to be anxious to follow this path and draw a line under an episode that has done much to besmirch the name of men's tennis. The association, Wada noted, was rather too quick to concur with the theory that its own trainers might be responsible for doping its own players. The testing of the suspect electrolytes handed out by the ATP trainers failed to show up traces of nandrolone-related products, with Wada adding: \"Now it is clearly established that the source of contamination is not the electrolyte, the legal analysis behind the seven cases is not sustainable.\" Wada also criticised the ATP for not taking one or more of the seven cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. This was backed up yesterday by the ITF which noted that at the time it had recommended to the ATP that the cases be referred to the court for final judgments. The ITF said it agreed with the report's conclusions, especially the need for independent research, and has already written to Wada asking it to push ahead with the recommended scientific investigation into the nandrolone \"fingerprint\". None of the cases can be reopened, however. Over the last decade elite tennis has changed greatly, with a huge emphasis on physical power and almost instantaneous recovery. While there is no clear evidence of endemic drug use, it cannot be ruled out. The fudging of the positive dope tests by unproved theories and the ensuing legal arguments has done nothing to clear the air. Whatever the source of the nandrolone positives, under the rule of strict liability - the cornerstone of all anti-doping procedures - the seven players and Rusedski were fortunate to have been let off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
