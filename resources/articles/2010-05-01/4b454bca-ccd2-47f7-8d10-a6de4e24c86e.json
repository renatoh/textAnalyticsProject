Today's deal from the Spring Fours led to the following conversation between a leading player and a young student of the game. YS: \"How did you make that slam? There were two losers.\" LP: \"I lost them, of course.\" YS: \"But I don't understand. How can you make a slam if you lose two tricks?\" LP: \"I didn't say I lost two tricks. I lost two losers, but they were both on the same trick. Of course, I was lucky they didn't find the right opening lead.\" Love all, dealer West. West opened with one heart. North overcalled with one spade and East supported his partner's hearts by one means or another. West became declarer in six hearts and North led the king of spades. Winning with the ace, declarer embarked on a cross-ruff: a spade was ruffed in the West hand, the ace of clubs was cashed for a diamond discard from the table, and a club was led towards the dummy. If North were to ruff in with the queen of hearts (one of declarer's losers), West would discard a diamond (the other one) from dummy, effectively losing both his losers on the same trick. If North were to discard spades as declarer ruffed clubs, a long spade would be established on the table and West could discard his own diamond loser on it as North ruffed with the trump trick he was destined to make anyway. And if North discarded diamonds, declarer could achieve a complete cross-ruff, with North's queen of hearts and South's queen of diamonds taking the 13th trick. It would have been fatal for declarer to draw a round of trumps at any stage, and the LP was right about the opening lead. If North leads a heart, apparently giving up his sure trick in the suit, he can at some early stage ruff a club with the queen of hearts and play another trump. Not even the LP could have coped with that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
