They had bowled resourcefully and with good heart. Yet, if their pride was intact, it had not quite escaped the attention that so was the Indian innings. Six hours' hard labour and all England's bowlers had to show for it were the wickets of a nightwatchman and a wicketkeeper - with the latter, Deep Dasgupta, making a cautious, if immensely valuable, hundred in his first home Test. India, with seven wickets intact, were already 24 runs to the good, and Sachin Tendulkar had not yet broken sweat. Richard Dawson, the tyro Yorkshire off-spinner, did at least have a first Test wicket to celebrate, Anil Kumble's nightwatchman's stint extending until 15 minutes before lunch when he nicked an attempted cut to another debutant, the wicketkeeper James Foster. That wicket perfectly illustrated the nature of this England attack. For a side of old salts, the removal of a nightwatchman after two hours, to a routine delivery, would have brought a furrowed brow and the odd world-weary backslap. But Dawson, successful with only his 12th ball in Test cricket, was beside himself with happiness and was soon submerged by delighted team-mates. This was \"Test cricket: a Fun Thing\", where shortcomings are defensible on the grounds of inexperience. But however skilfully Nasser Hussain cajoles and directs, four members of this attack boast only 15 wickets and 17 caps between them. Not that Dasgupta, one of six Indian wicketkeepers tried in the past year, is exactly steeped in experience. He was in only his third Test and, although he began life as an opening batsman, he had to be pressed into service at the top of the order during India's disastrous tour of South Africa last month and, having played two staunch innings to save the Port Elizabeth Test, finds himself kept on. Dasgupta scored 15 in the pre-lunch session, including more than an hour stuck on 21, and he needed nearly 3 hours to reach 50. His story is considerably more interesting than his innings. In his formative years in Delhi he was coached by a woman, Suneeta Sharma, and has played club cricket in Liverpool and Scotland. The fact that an impatient crowd barracked him and his partner Rahul Dravid with calls of \"Murdabad\" - Urdu for \"down with\" - did not bother him. \"Everybody is impatient to see Sachin bat,\" he said. Dasgupta scored predominantly behind square until awakening with a second 50 from 93 balls, reckless by his standards, and increasingly fortunate too. Andrew Flintoff might have dismissed him with a lethal bouncer on 51 which flew wide of Foster, and had him dropped by Mark Butcher at slip on 75. Dawson forced an edge which flew wide of Flintoff at slip, and Foster's wild attempt to run him out granted him four overthrows. He reached three figures by thick-edging Matthew Hoggard to third man, and then was immediately bowled by Craig White. Dravid reached the close on 78. Struck by Hoggard on the elbow early in his innings, he was badly dropped by Foster, off Flintoff, when 33. Foster had an untidy day. Select a side for the here and now and Warren Hegg would take precedence. Foster, though, is seen as the future. This is a learning tour. Of that you will be forever reminded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
