In the latest of a string of accusations about the expenses of MPs and peers, the Sunday Telegraph claimed Byers had spent more than \u00a327,000 of taxpayers' money on redecoration, maintenance and appliances at the flat in Camden, north London, during the past five years. Byers is the second Labour MP who has been found to have used the expenses system to benefit a partner. Health minister Ben Bradshaw was also accused by the Telegraph of claiming Commons expenses to help pay a mortgage on a London home he shares with his civil partner, Neal Dalgleish. Junior minister Kitty Ussher was reported to have written a letter to parliamentary authorities detailing extensive refurbishments she had planned for her \"second home\" in London. A two-page letter by the MP, whose work at the Department for Work and Pensions includes the reform of housing benefit, specified 12 separate major repairs, including the removal of an Artex ceiling. She wrote: \"Most of the ceilings have Artex coverings. Three-dimensional swirls. It could be a matter of taste, but this counts as 'dilapidations' in my book! Can the ACA [Additional Costs Allowance] pay for the ceilings to be plastered over and repainted?\" Baroness Thornton, a Labour junior minister in the whips' office, was last night also embroiled in the controversy over parliamentary expenses claims after the Sunday Times reported that she was claiming up to \u00a322,000 a year by saying that her mother's bungalow in Yorkshire is her main home. Baroness Thornton, who has a \u00a31m family house near Hampstead Heath, reportedly claimed about \u00a3130,000 since 2002 by designating her mother's current bungalow and, before 2005, her mother's previous home, as her main residence. The latest tranche of leaks will also embarrass former Tory cabinet minister John Gummer, who reportedly claimed \u00a3100 a year on parliamentary expenses to rid his Suffolk estate of moles, and allegedly wrote his own receipts for other maintenance work. The former environment secretary used the parliamentary expenses system to claim more than \u00a39,000 a year for gardening and received hundreds of pounds for costs such as removing jackdaw nests, tackling insect infestations and an annual \"rodent service\" contract. Gummer reportedly has a \u00a360,000 mortgage on the property where he lives in Suffolk and initially claimed around \u00a3200 a month towards the interest on the loan. But the Telegraph's latest story says that he claimed close to the maximum allowance of more than \u00a320,000 every year during most years once his other expenses were added. Leaked letters also suggested that parliamentary officials became concerned that Gummer was not producing receipts to justify his claims, prompting him to forward a number of almost identical statements from gardeners, cleaners and others. Another former minister to be singled out in the latest leaks was the former home secretary, John Reid, who was said to have used expenses claims for a series of furnishings to a flat in Glasgow that he moved into in 2008, claiming for a \u00a3199 pouffe, a \u00a3370 armchair and an \u00a3899 sofa. The MP also submitted a \u00a3486.50 receipt for a series of items such as an ironing board and a slotted spoon bought in Marks &amp; Spencer last August. Yesterday there were signs that some MPs were mounting a fightback against the Daily Telegraph's \"drip by drip\" revelations last week. Immigration minister Phil Woolas described the paper's statement that he had claimed for nappies and women's clothes as completely wrong and said he would talk to his lawyers today about possible legal action. Woolas said the items were included on a receipt that contained food for which he was claiming. But he made clear that the nappies and women's items were not part of the claim. Bradshaw said some of the information published in the paper about him was incorrect. Today, in a leading article, the Sunday Telegraph appears to pull back from some of the implications of wrongdoing. It states: \"There are those MPs who, despite their good intentions, have none the less fallen victim to an overly complex system that has served to portray their actions in an unflattering light.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
