Frustrated when they couldn't track down the Champions League matches they wanted to watch during the 2007 season, they set the site up in their spare time with their own cash, and still run it from their base in Cheshire. Director Wes Lewis takes us through the site. \u2022 Explain your business to my Mum \"WherestheMatch.com is an internet TV listings guide that informs you when sport is being shown live on satellite and terrestrial TV over the next 31 days.\" \"Our home page, by default, shows the TV sports listing for today. It shows you the sport being played, the teams playing each other, the time of the match and the channels that the matches are being broadcast on. Users can navigate to see the next 7 days, or choose to view the month ahead. There's a Facebook application too.\" \u2022 How do you make money? \"WherestheMatch.com is currently a free service to users, and revenue will be made via affiliate marketing, banner advertising, partnerships and sponsorships. Enhanced users (that's a future project) will be charged in the future to use the service.\" \u2022 What's your background? \"I graduated in web design in 1998 and have had several jobs in the industry, most recently for Autotrader.co.uk, re-developing the user experience for its search platform. I have worked on several entrepreneurial projects, including price comparison site priceinspector.co.uk and other affiliate marketing ventures.\" \u2022 Name your closest competitors \"Liveonsat.com is by far the biggest site out there, although they target a wider audience. In the UK, our only competitor is livesportontv.com, although when we came up with the idea of WherestheMatch, we couldn't find the site even when we were looking when a particular match was being played. That's the reason we started.\" \u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months? \"We currently have 4,000 registered users, and currently have 60,000 visitors per month. We hope to have 100,000 registered users within 12 months, with 40,000 unique visitors per day.\" \u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business? \"Personalisation is a major part of our business. The core feature of WherestheMatch.com allows our registered users to select their favourite teams and refine their TV listings to show just these teams. We encourage users to refine the site so that they can quickly find the information that is relevant to them.\" \u2022 What's your biggest challenge? \"Getting the brand out to the masses. Collectively, we have all the technology skills required to succeed but that's worthless if you can't get your name out.\" \u2022 Any weird business experiences so far? \"When you have a deep personal interest in the product and getting it right, you can overdo it sometimes. I was so deeply engrossed in one coding section I worked 30 hours straight. When you watch your own code shuffle itself on the page that's when you know it's time for bed.\" \u2022 How's you work/life balance? \"As with any startup, this kind of goes out of the window at times. We currently all have day jobs, so our 'life' outside work is spent running WherestheMatch. It's an elephant wearing a 'one last bit of work and we'll be there' T-shirt and I can't see him shifting for a while yet.\" \u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble? \"I think the web has changed considerably since the last dot com bubble, although the opportunity to make a quick million has long gone. Expectations are very high these days and users are hard to please. Social interaction and the community web seems to have changed the way people use the web these days, so websites that can enhance the social aspect will do well. WherestheMatch.com is a niche service and will hopefully fill a gap that has been created by increasing levels of competition in sports TV rights.\" \u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch? \"It's hard to list all the essential sites, but the rich internet applications (RIA) space is one to look out for as Adobe Flex and Microsoft Silverlight gain full momentum. Ajax focused sites have already moved the bar up high.\" \u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day? \"Google Analytics - early growth is so important for WherestheMatch.com that we need to know just how we are performing.\" \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years? \"Operated from a beach Wi-Fi connection in Barbados... Seriously, I want it to be a household name, the first site people think of when they wonder who is playing on the TV that night.\" WheresTheMatch.com So what do you think? \u2022 Is this too niche to last? \u2022 How do you think the guys could expand or develop the site further, and how else they could make money? \u2022 Would it make more sense for this service to live on the website of a football body or a national broadcaster, or would you trust it more if it stayed independent?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
