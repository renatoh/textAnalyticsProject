Six days after Swansea City's FA Cup win at Old Trafford, Januzaj was the outstanding player in the 2-0 defeat of the Welsh club, being involved in both goals, scored by Antonio Valencia and Danny Welbeck, as the Premier League champions ended a run of three defeats. \"He has been like that since day one,\" Moyes said. \"Adnan can play in all the positions around the front. I speak to him a lot and he tells me he could play everywhere and he would have no problem. He's not a nervous boy. I wanted to see if it would give us any more creativity, any more [attacking] positions, and help us. \"He needs teaching and understanding because he is still learning the game in a lot of the things he is doing. But his talent and natural ability is up there with the best and I think, in time, he will prove to be that.\" United's next assignment is at Chelsea a week from now and Moyes said he can sense from his players \"that it will not be long before this difficult period turns around\". His team have actually won five of their past six Premier League matches, albeit this being their first victory of any sorts since the turn of the year, and Moyes added: \"I sleep great every night. I hope it will become a long way better. I would like to think it's going to improve a lot but you have to start somewhere and I thought today was more like it. \"We scored two goals, we should have scored more and I can't remember Swansea having a shot at goal. It felt in the main that we had control of the game. We had a chance to the score the first goal in the first half \u2013 Danny Welbeck has a big chance \u2013 but I thought from the start of the second half we played very well and deservedly scored two goals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
