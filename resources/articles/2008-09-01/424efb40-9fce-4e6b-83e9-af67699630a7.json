She was also involved in two other feminist magazines, Outwrite, and, in 1992, Bad Attitude. Katy was inspired by the 1990s Riot Grrrl and Queercore punk bands, some of whom she interviewed for Bad Attitude. She took up DJing and played at lesbian and gay punk clubs, including Up to the Elbow and Sick of It All - the latter which she started with friends. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where her English father was an electronic engineer, she grew up in Barnham, West Sussex and Reading, and graduated in English from King's College, Cambridge. In the late 1980s, she gravitated towards Brixton, south London, and said that, for the first time, she felt at home. Her life was transformed by the birth of her children Orla in 2002 and Joe in 2007. Her happy parenting experiences informed her involvement with the lesbian mothers' group, Out for Our Children. Her first book for young children, Spacegirl Pukes, appeared last year - she was proud that a book could be published in which a child had two mothers without the fact needing any explanation - and her second book, Dangerous Deborah Puts Her Foot Down, will appear soon. Her novel, High on Life, a fictionalised account of heroin addiction, was published in 2002. She is survived by her children, her parents and her sister Anna."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
