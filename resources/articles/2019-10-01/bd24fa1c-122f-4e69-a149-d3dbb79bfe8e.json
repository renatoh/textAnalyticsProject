Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes three and four. Money talks If you\u2019re counting, \u20ac329,510 fell out of that loft last week, which is a decent haul for some dopey kids putting in a few minutes\u2019 work. The current understanding is that Herville\u2019s informant Wang was holding drugs and money for the Curial estate gangsters, headed by Nassir Benslimane. In the garment district, we\u2019ve got pillar of the Wen community Mr Chen running Agathe Passion and Wang\u2019s partner in the Chinese restaurant Wei Xu running Street Fashion. The rag trade washes the dirty money, and so the gears of the black economy keep turning. The vital intel comes from Kader \u2013 but not before he plays Ali like a harpsichord, getting a witness\u2019s name and address from him without lifting a finger. As a result, the witness catches a beatdown and her flat gets trashed. Ali\u2019s misstep is so knuckleheaded it calls to mind prime Gilou. This new kid is fitting in just fine. The squad are nothing if not persistent, though, and they get their first big break when they discover Rayan\u2019s brother Fouad transporting cash for the Chinese. With Rayan now in custody, Fouad\u2019s next visit suddenly becomes a lot more interesting. Gilou Some nice buddy comedy develops between Ali and Gilou, plus laughter and tears at Herville\u2019s funeral where Beckriche gives a funny and moving eulogy. But the real emotional clout comes with the return of Tintin. The divorce, being shot in the head and leaving the squad have given Fromentin perspective, insight, and the certain knowledge that, in the end, it is not some all-consuming career, but love that counts. \u201cDon\u2019t mess it up,\u201d he says intently to Gilou and Laure, like he\u2019s some fanfic writer who has never met them. No offence, Tintin, but messing it up is kind of their thing. Laure Laure misses the surveillance operation, falling asleep in her car as she did during her under-rated homeless period. Her tardiness is, however, the only reason she is able to catch up with the fake postman and identify the Chinatown fashion connection, so yay Laure, I guess? Less stellar is her parenting performance, which hits a new low this week as she risks Romy\u2019s life by dodging Nathalie\u2019s calls alerting her to her daughter\u2019s illness. It lands her in family court, with the Br\u00e9monts seeking full parental responsibility for the child. She doesn\u2019t even put up a fight \u2013 knowing as she must by now that Romy is better off without her. Jos\u00e9phine Over to Ms Karlsson, who\u2019s been putting in some hours doing pro bono family law for heroin addict inmate M\u00e9lanie (it\u2019s just as well for Romy that Laure didn\u2019t have her in her corner). Spotting a fine legal distinction between kidnapping and parental child abduction that M\u00e9lanie\u2019s lawyer missed, she offers her new client knowledge that will secure her release. All she asks in return is that the dope getting hurled over the wall into the yard now goes to Lola. It\u2019s a fair deal. Later, Jos\u00e9phine and Lola bond through the cell bars of solitary after throwing down with Sabine the crooked guard. I\u2019d like to say friendship or romance is on the cards, but the smart money is on an apocalyptic crimewave. Meanwhile, on Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s attempted murder rap, Edelman pulls out all the stops in a crime scene reconstruction that seems to show that Vern could not possibly have identified Jos\u00e9phine on the night in question. That\u2019s just the tonic a girl needs \u2013 but when her old nemesis Judge Wagner insists on a reconstruction of his own, you can hear the facepalm from the moon. Roban Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine Micallef continue to use M Vouters\u2019 fatal haemorrhage as a springboard for their outrageous flirting. It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2013 a principled overworked doc \u2013 struggling to hit hospital targets \u2013 warns the suits about chronic understaffing, is roundly ignored and then forced to carry the can when the inevitable avoidable death occurs. If anyone knows about fighting the system, it\u2019s Roban, and it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s finding the case for the defence very persuasive right now. Someone get a round of Calvados in. Notes and observations \u2022 Below-the-line Flic of the Week goes to MatthewCobb, who could see that Fouad was a wrong \u2019un from the jump. Trust no one on this show. \u2022 Nathalie Br\u00e9mont continues to be the most understanding wife in history, raising her husband\u2019s love child without complaint, phoning Laure around the clock to arrange children\u2019s parties or save her daughter\u2019s life. \u2022 Edelman remains the sleazy lawyer we all love to hate, but as he calls in a favour from his Bar Association president friend for Jos\u00e9phine, we get the strong impression it\u2019s for love. As touching as that is, I don\u2019t see it ending well. \u2022 The prefect (a senior civil servant) lets Beckriche know that any operations in the garment district will need Lenoir\u2019s personal approval. Political expedience trumps law enforcement once again. Procureur Machard would be proud. Just how deep is Fouad in the money-laundering racket? Will Jos\u00e9phine beat the rap? How long before Roban and Dr Micallef are an item? Over to you \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
