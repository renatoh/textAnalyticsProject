Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen episode six. Read the episode five recap here Welcome to our ongoing discussion of Broadchurch, where this week we\u2019ll unpick an episode that managed to largely shake off the exposition-heavy dialogue that has been a hallmark of this series. Instead, we had a tale of family: of those mended, those destroyed, and those still left in limbo. Writer Chris Chibnall picked up the strands of his drama and wove them together with some skill: Ellie\u2019s fury at losing Tom propelling her into drastic action; Alec one step closer to finding some peace with Tess and Daisy; Beth confronted with her husband\u2019s decision to leave her; Sharon fighting doggedly for her son\u2019s safety; Claire and Lee trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to find a life together. I saw echoes of the first season, and its quality, in the scenes of Broadchurch\u2019s inhabitants \u2013 permanent and temporary \u2013 contemplating their worlds in the fading light. Some hopeful of new beginnings; others crushed by regret and guilt. And I liked the journey into Alec\u2019s subconscious, too, as the anaesthetic took hold, and we were pulled down into his mind. Previously, I found the flashbacks a bit intrusive: this worked better as a device, I thought. There were some interesting moments between Hardy and Miller this week, too \u2013 Tess determinedly sending Ellie away from his bedside, Hardy allowing himself to be bossed by his deputy over what to do next in the Sandbrook case. I loved the post-operation exchange between them. \u201cI\u2019ll give you money to shut up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give you more money to be less of a knob!\u201d The Latimer case More of the first series\u2019 loose ends were tied up, with Mark Latimer\u2019s trip to the police cells to confront Joe coming back to haunt the prosecution \u2013 I must admit, the defence had a point when it comes to all the police failings in procedure. But mainly this week was about Tom, and his misguided attempts to save his father from prison, and the man he implicated instead. Jocelyn\u2019s firm-but-gentle cross-examination was the first time she\u2019s really come to life in the court scenes for me: it was a welcome change of pace from all the usual hectoring. (I must say, I think the Jocelyn v Sharon rivalry thing isn\u2019t really working \u2013 until she did her \u201cI must beat her!\u201d speech today, I\u2019d largely forgotten about it.) Andrew Buchan\u2019s performance has been strong from the show\u2019s opening scenes, but in recent episodes his tear-soaked rendering of Mark has been remarkable: his desire to speak for Danny prompting the grieving father to lay his emotions and life bare. Given everything they\u2019ve been through, you\u2019d have hoped for a happier ending for him and Beth; they have been red-eyed for the vast majority of the show. Even Ellie got a break on the crying. Sandbrook Claire is increasingly being painted as the crazed mastermind behind the disappearance of Pippa and Lisa \u2013 a state of affairs Eve Myles seems to be embracing with some gusto. When she\u2019s not throwing cereal/chairs/kitchen tables about, she\u2019s out having furious sex in some ruins, or looking around chocolate-boxy cottages with Lee. (His handyman business must be booming.) \u201cWe need to make a plan,\u201d she tells Lee. \u201cWe made a plan and you screwed it!\u201d he shouts back, before getting down to the actual screwing. Perhaps wordplay is foreplay for them? Next week they\u2019ll be meeting for scrabble on the cliffside. (Talking of sex: Olly appeared to have pulled via the unlikely line of, \u201cAlright, wiggy\u201d. Turned out Abby only wanted him for his paperwork.) We now know that it was Claire that stole the pendant, and that at one point she was wearing it \u2013 although it seemed remarkably careless that she would have kept a photo of herself doing so, and then shown it to Ellie. Not that either of those things will hold up in court. I\u2019m still unsure why everybody is lying about their relationships in Sandbrook: Lee did have something with Cate; Claire did have something with Ricky. From her furious response to Ellie \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s just jealous about Lee\u201d \u2013 we are (or Ellie is) presumably meant to infer that Claire also had some kind of relationship/fling with Alec. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Terrifying woman of the week part one: a rampaging Claire was bloody scary. \u2022 Terrifying woman of the week part two: I loved seeing Ellie take charge of the situation with Tom, and order him home to the family house. The writing here was good I thought: \u201cYes we are because I\u2019m your bloody mother!\u201d I was pleased to see her home and decorating. Next week I\u2019m hoping she buys a new suit and anorak. \u2022 What has Abby taken from the convenient pile of paperwork in the kitchen? And are we meant to infer that she shagged Olly only to get into the house? That seems a bit much even for someone from that London. \u2022 \u201cThis is where you live? Bloody hell, Alec!\u201d Am I alone in thinking that Hardy\u2019s waterside shed/house is actually quite nice? Or could be with some better furniture and wallpaper that isn\u2019t made up of crime-scene photos. \u2022 More picturesque ridge-standing in evidence this week. If I were an asparagus farmer, I\u2019d move to Broadchurch before you could say Jack Robinson. \u2022 I\u2019m presuming the Sandbrook garden gate was there not so children could move between gardens, but to facilitate affairs. Although creeping through the garden to go and shag your next-door neighbour seems really a weird plot point. \u2022 Who puts a hot Le Creuset pan straight onto the table, even if it\u2019s got a cloth on it? Surely you\u2019ve heard of a trivet, Maggie!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
