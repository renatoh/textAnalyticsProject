A survey of 1,515 new parents by the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) also found that more than one in 10 new mothers said they were embarrassed to speak to health professionals about baby bonding issues. Elizabeth Duff, the NCT\u2019s senior policy advisor, said: \u201cThe bond a baby has with its parents acts as a template that shapes the child\u2019s emotions and relationships later in life, so it\u2019s a crucial process. \u201cParents who don\u2019t feel an instant connection with their new baby often experience strong feelings of guilt, shame and inadequacy. \u201cWe hope our research reassures new parents that they are not alone if they don\u2019t instantly bond with their baby and that this can often take time.\u201d Duff said GPs, midwives and other health professionals play an important role in baby bonding and must encourage new parents to speak up if there is a problem. The survey, carried out by polling firm Survation, found that 32% of new mothers said they had experienced difficulties bonding with their baby. Twelve per cent said they would feel embarrassed talking to professionals about it. The research was released to coincide with the UK\u2019s first infant mental health awareness week, starting on Monday. Experts say the process of early bonding between a parent and baby influences the baby\u2019s response to stress, learning behaviours and social skills. Parents experiencing difficulty forming an emotional connection to their newborn are encouraged to socialise with other new parents, embrace physical closeness and interact with the baby regularly by talking, reading or singing to him or her. A report by the Sutton Trust charity in 2014 found overwhelming evidence that the bond between parent and child from birth to the age of three becomes even more crucial to a child\u2019s development if the family is experiencing poverty and other disadvantages. The study urged health services and children\u2019s centres to quickly identify and offer support to parents who are failing to bond with their children in order to head off serious educational and social problems in later life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
