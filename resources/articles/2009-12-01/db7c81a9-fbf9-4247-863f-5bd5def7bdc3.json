The only thing that might get in the way would be either Brive playing above themselves or Scarlets upsetting the pre-tournament form guide. Two wins in their opening two rounds presented the Welsh in an unreal light, but reality set in at a freezing RDS when Leinster wiped them out with a seven-try blitz. So barring a calamity for either London Irish or Leinster in round five \u2013 both of them are tied at the top of the Pool 6 \u2013 the issue will be settled at the Madejski next month. \"We've got to redeem that [loss to London Irish] and we can't do that if we look past the next opponent,\" Michael Cheika said afterwards. \"I know too much about this tournament to get drawn into the battle that's two weeks ahead or whatever. When that time does come we'll be fixed on that match.\" And they will have Jonathan Sexton back at the controls. His stand-in, Shaun Berne, is well removed from the level of accuracy needed to be a frontline kicker and he managed only two from eight attempts here. Sexton should be back for the Connacht game in the Magners League on 2 January. He was not missed last night because an injury-strapped Scarlets side were in big trouble from early in the game attended by a full house of 18,500. Stephen Jones was missing penalties when they badly needed settling, but even those three misses would not have kept them in the hunt against Leinster in this mood. They are now at a stage where their teamwork and understanding is enabling them to keep the ball in areas where other teams are losing it. And they have key players in good form: all their outside backs were rampant but most encouraging was the form of Eoin Reddan who lost out with Ireland last month. He was sharp in everything he did against Scarlets and his judgment was first class. It helped that Leinster picked up where they left off last weekend with the quality of their work at the breakdown. He got lots of ball and he used it well. The only curious thing was the form of Rob Kearney, who had inordinate difficulty with the high ball \u2013 a unique occurrence for him \u2013 and a few other things besides, yet still finished with two tries. Gordon D'Arcy and Brian O'Driscoll also managed two apiece. The bonus point was sorted early in the second half. Leinster turned over 15-0 ahead, and then D'Arcy sorted the extras seven minutes into the second period. The only downside for Leinster was the loss of CJ van der Linde with a recurrence of calf trouble. It would have been a disaster had it been the foot injury that has blighted his time in Leinster but either way they have seen only glimpses of how good he can be. He caused havoc with the Scarlets scrum in the first half and how Leinster would benefit from that if he could stay fit enough for long enough. Instead they had to be happy with the form of their back row especially, where Kevin McLaughlin is doing an excellent job on the short side. Jamie Heaslip picked up the man of the match award but Sean O'Brien and McLaughlin cannot have been far behind him. Shane Horgan, too, is in excellent shape and his intercept try was as memorable as any of the other scores. Horgan is not noted for international gas but having nabbed a pass from Deacon Manu he left two chasers for dead on the 80-metre spring to the line. That was the game's third try and despite Berne's wayward kicking it convinced Scarlets that they would be getting nothing from the game. They caved in after the break with D'Arcy and O'Driscoll donig huge damage in the middle of the field. Scarlets' only positive stat was a late try for Rhys Priestland on a day when they looked like they wanted to be somewhere else. Anywhere else. Leinster looked like they wanted to get on with the London Irish game straight away. They have some time to fill in until then but it will be hard for all concerned not to let their minds drift in that direction. If they can maintain or improve this form it will be a classic encounter.
