In 1998, the current TV belle epoque not even a twinkle in the eye of the US networks, a pilot was filmed for a TV series of the Coen brothers' churningly tense black comedy Fargo, which had been released two years previously. It was the last writing and production credit for the late Bruce Paltrow (father of Gwyneth), starred The Sopranos' Edie Falco and was directed by Misery actor and occasional director Kathy Bates. Set in Brainerd, Minnesota, it featured Falco as police chief Marge Gunderson, the role immortalised by Frances McDormand in the movie. The Coen brothers were not involved. The project, though strangely enticing, fizzled out. Then, in 2012, news emerged that another telly crew had taken an interest in the world of Fargo, beginning a slow drip-feed of information about the project that indicated very good things indeed. Firstly, FX, the maverick Fox spin-off network behind brooding dramas such as Justified and Sons Of Anarchy, would be making it. Writing would be Noah Hawley, a novelist and TV writer with a CV including crime comedy-drama Bones. More convincing still, it would not feature any of the same characters from the film, and was amassing an undeniably classy cast, including Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Colin Hanks, US sketch comedy dons Key &amp; Peele, and Oliver Platt. It was also being ordered \"straight to series\", the holy grail in US TV's cautious pilot system. Finally \u2013 the coup de gr\u00e2ce to any naysayers \u2013 the Coens themselves, unlike with the efforts back in 1998, had read it, liked it, and signed on as executive producers. The Coens' blessing transformed the cautious optimism about the show into outright buzz. And here we are. \"Joel and Ethan read the first script,\" says Hawley. \"They were very complimentary about it. Then they saw the first episode when it was completed, and Ethan said 'Yeah, good'. Billy [Bob Thornton], of course, has worked with the Coens two or three times. He said that 'Yeah, good' is like a rave review from Ethan.\" Hawley's first conversation with FX, which was negotiating with rights owners MGM about making the series, went something like this: \"OK, so you've asked me to create a television series. This is not a television series,\" he says. \"That got their attention, and I talked them through how I would approach it. It's a 10-hour movie.\" Aesthetically, Hawley's take is pretty indivisible from cinema, and there are many reverent nods to the film throughout. The \"Minnesota nice\" mild-manneredness and lilting Nordic twang is, pleasingly, very much upfront. The first episode begins with the same onscreen titles, the blurb beginning \"This is a true story\", changing only the dates. (As with the original film, the \"true story\" bit is a cheerily flagrant fib). The series features a heavily pregnant woman but, unlike in the film, she's not Frances McDormand's character. And in the opening scene, Thornton's character crashes his car along what could be the same bleak, barb-fenced highway where kidnapper Steve Buscemi buried his briefcase of money. There are a handful of more oblique Coens references, too. In a bar, Jeffrey Lebowski's beverage of choice, the white Russian, is on special offer. Newcomer Allison Tolman has slotted into the de facto Marge role, playing small-town policewoman Molly Solverson, who is almost immediately thrust into a world of mindless violence. Seemingly, the references to the movie were not meant to be decipherable only by film geeks. \"When there's a nod to the film, it's a really definite nod,\" she says, \"a deliberate choice that Noah has made. He'll say, 'We're going to set up this shot, and it's going to look just like the shot in the movie.' We don't want people to be only 'kind of' reminded of it. And that's refreshing. It removes any fear of that grey area.\" 'I felt the same trepidation that every person who's a fan of the movie would feel. But by page eight or nine I'd set that aside' Bob Odenkirk Molly's character is soon circling the chaotic Lorne Malvo, played by Billy Bob Thornton, an agent of mayhem in the mould of Anton Chigurh, the malevolent murderer from the Coens' No Country For Old Men. He has an equally bad haircut. Chance throws Malvo into contact with Martin Freeman's Lester Nygaard in an emergency room. Nygaard \u2013 Freeman's accent is excellent, by the way \u2013 is an emasculated insurance salesman, the equivalent of William H Macy's clammy and deceitful Jerry Lundegaard. He is ridiculed by his wife, wound up and about to snap. After Lester is taunted in the street by his old high-school bully, Malvo offers him a chance to claw back some respect. But the cost, as he soon discovers, is more than he can stomach, and a calamitous chain of events is set in motion. Bob Odenkirk, Breaking Bad's sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman, is on the right side of the law this time, playing Bill Olson, a police deputy with an aversion to crime scenes thanks to his sensitive gag reflex. \"I felt the same trepidation that every person who's a fan of the movie would feel,\" says Odenkirk. \"But by page eight or nine I'd set that aside. Saul Goodman was fun to play, but incredibly cynical. This character that I play in Fargo is his polar opposite.\" He continues: \"The dynamic of the movie is in this show: that intense evil and darkness, brought to a comical extreme, mixed with the world of these innocent people who literally cannot get their minds round the possibility of the evil that is around them. It's hard even for them to conceive that it could be happening. And that's really fun to watch.\" Odenkirk also revels in the analog between Freeman's Nygaard and Macy's Lundegaard. \"I remember feeling that claustrophobia watching Bill Macy's character, making one bad decision after another and feeling like, 'Ah, this fucking idiot! He's gonna fuck it up even worse!' I both love and hate that feeling. It drives you crazy. And it's the same here. [Lester] is that nebbishy, constricted character that's just trying to protect his own neck.\" As well as maintaining Coen-esque levels of awkwardness and humour, Hawley also wanted to retain what he refers to as the \"Mike Yanagita moments\". In the film, McDormand's Marge is contacted out of the blue by an old school friend who spins her a yarn about how his wife has died from leukaemia. It's a marvellous scene, and fabulously awkward, though it is entirely extraneous. \"But it's one of those 'truth is stranger than fiction' details that helps the movie feel true,\" says Hawley. \"I asked the network straight away: what are our Mike Yanagita moments? What are we going to put in this show that might feel nonsensical, but play into that 'accept the mystery' philosophy that the Coens have built into their work?\" Hawley is no mug. He knows that, ultimately, this project wasn't crying out for a remake or reboot. \"The reality is it doesn't need to be done, it's television,\" he says. \"Finding material that people want to watch is really the only measure of why [networks] do things. But when someone calls you and says 'Do you want to make a Coen brothers movie for television?', you say yes, because when are you ever going to get that opportunity again?\" One final question needs to be asked: does the new Fargo have its own woodchipper moment? \"All I'll say is that the Coens kill people in some very creative and memorable ways,\" replies Hawley, \"and it was my obligation to come up with ways of my own. I hope I rose to the standard.\" Fargo starts in the UK on 20 April, 9pm, Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
