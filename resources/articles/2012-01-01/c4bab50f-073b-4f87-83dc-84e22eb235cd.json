Few cheerful things have emerged from the financial downturn for me, but a kick in the pants for the roaring TV snob brigade is one of them. I love television. I've spent a lifetime defending that magical box of flashes and bangs in the corner of the room as just as valid an art form as a night watching thesps clank through Chekhov or tickets to see the latest Darren Aronofsky. \"Oh, you write about television? I don't have one,\" thundering dullards often said to me at parties. \"I buy the Guardian and I throw that section out.\" As finances become tighter, it seems even the highest-brows are recognising the low-cost beauty in loose-fitting track pants, a comfy sofa, the humble Kettle chip and Breaking Bad on Netflix or a Sky+ stack of The Hour, Rev, The Shadow Line or The Crimson Petal And The White. \"I can't wait for the new series of Mad Men on Sky Atlantic,\" an academic friend told me recently. \"It's a real event. We stay in especially for it. And we plan meals around it. And get really annoyed when anyone spoils it for us.\" I don't want to darken the glee by saying, \"You mean, you've discovered how to watch television without guilt and bloody love it? Just like a normal person without two degrees and an MA? Well, this is a turn-up!\" So instead I just smile sweetly. My tip for 2012 is Homeland, coming to Channel 4 next month, a spy thriller with Damian Lewis and Claire Danes. It's simply stunning television. But then, you probably don't even own a telly, do you?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
