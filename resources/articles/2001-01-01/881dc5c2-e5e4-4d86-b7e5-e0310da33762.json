Negotiations to bring Toshack back are at \"an advanced stage\", said the San Sebastian club's president Luis Uranga Otaegui yesterday. Toshack, coaching St Etienne in France, is reported to be satisfied with details of the move, but the two clubs have to agree on compensation. A decision is expected tomorrow. \"He is an important person in the history of Real Sociedad,\" said Uranga, referring to Toshack's two previous spells as coach. Real Sociedad are lying bottom of the Liga and Uranga is under serious pressure to bring forward the club presidential elections, scheduled for spring. Hiring Toshack would be a way of deflecting the criticism. \"We are trying to get him to sign without anybody getting annoyed,\" Uranga added. \"The deal is close to completion.\" Toshack has a mixed reputation in Spain: the last club he coached there, Real Madrid, sacked him in 1999 for refusing to answer criticisms for a poor start to the season. Romario is about to sign for Internazionale, according to reports in Italy and Brazil. The Italian club's president Massimo Moratti and Romario are said to have agreed personal terms and a \u00a31m deal for the rest of the season with the option of a further 12 months. Romario's contract with Vasco da Gama has just expired. \"I'm older and better, like wine, no?\" he said. \"I don't smoke, I don't drink and I run as much as I have to on the pitch. That's why I've scored so many goals this season at the age of 34. I'm playing as well as I did in 1994, my best season, but scoring more goals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
