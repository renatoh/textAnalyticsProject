Salman Rushdie declares himself 'pretty happy' with it. It's massively ambitious. The scope of Rushdie's Booker of Bookers is enormous: a family saga and an epic documentary of the history of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh from 1915 to 1978, 'it swoops in and out of dozens of minds'. Its narrator is 'a swallower of lives'. Using his TV version as a basis, Rushdie has come up with a script in collaboration with the director, Tim Supple, and Simon Reade, former RSC literary manager. 'Surprisingly,' Rushdie says, 'we didn't yell at each other.' It concentrates on 'the spine of the story', and Rushdie is pleased with the new resolution of his baby-swap plot, half wishing he'd thought of it originally. He's changed one character's death, killing him off in 'a different, pretty satisfying way'. Rushdie trusts Supple to suggest some of the attributes of his prose. The director is aiming at a 'theatrical cousin' to the book. He's planning 'vivid and vital rhythms' and as 'rich as possible a tapestry' of stage manners to put across the Rushdie idiom. There's to be plenty of straightforward story-telling and plenty of elliptical, teasing story-telling: Supple enjoys 'the slippery authority' of the novel's narrator. And since 'you can't avoid the language of the cinema in Salman Rushdie', movies will be much drawn on, using 'a cinematic language: short scenes, short speeches, sharp quick edits'. The design by Melly Still - Rushdie thinks it 'wonderful to have a director called Supple and a designer called Still' - will include an enormous screen at the back of the stage. Documentary footage will convey the historical aspects of the novel. Rushdie is particularly pleased that the cast - mainly British Asian actors who are routinely presented with parts as hospital orderlies - will have 'meaty Indian roles'. Sameena Zehra and Kulvinder Ghir from Goodness Gracious Me will be appearing. And Zubin Varla, 'recently seen as Caliban', was quickly chosen as the lead. The novelist will be sitting in on some rehearsals, as he did when Haroun and the Sea of Stories was dramatised, and he is again looking forward to being drawn aside by actors with very 'specific, concrete' questions about their characters. And Supple is confident about this next stage of their collaboration. After all, Rushdie 'likes the quick,the vulgar, the playful. His instinct may be poetic, but he's a great showman'.

On 1 February, the Design Museum presents a retrospective of the work of Manolo Blahnik. Born in the Canary Islands in 1942, Blahnik studied law in Geneva before dropping out of college to become a theatre designer. On a visit to New York in 1971, however, he showed his designs to the great fashion editor Diana Vreeland, who suggested he made shoes instead. Thus, a style legend was born. The next year, he made his first collection for his friend Ossie Clark, and, since then, his delicate creations - which, mystifyingly, manage to be both wearable and as beautiful as spun sugar - have been worn by everyone from Bianca Jagger to Madonna, not to mention virtually the entire cast of Sex and the City. The exhibition will include sketches, rare prototypes and memorabilia from the designer's personal archive. Sounds like heaven? Yes, but be warned: a visit may have a highly detrimental effect on your bank balance. RC \u00b7 The Design Museum, London SE1 (020 7940 8790), 1 February - 11 May. www.designmuseum.org 28 JOANNA MacGREGOR The people's pianist Joanna MacGregor, she of the flying fingers and dancing dreadlocks, has shown characteristic chutzpah and set a precedent in the artery-hardened annals of classical music. Such has been the success of MacGregor's own CD label Sound Circus, launched in 1998, with recordings from Bach and Dowland to Birtwistle and Cage, and now a Mercury Prize nomination for Play - which features Bach, Berg and Piazzolla - that she has bought up her own backlist from Collins Classics. Starting with Bach's French suites, early 2003 will see the re-release of a dozen great MacGregor recordings, from Satie and more Birtwistle to her celebrated versions of the Hugh Wood concerto and Messiaen's Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus . AH \u00b7 Details at http://www.soundcircus.com 29 THE LOST PRINCE BBC drama is spending over one million pounds - the biggest ever such budget - advertising this lavish two-parter. Stephen Poliakoff - Perfect Strangers, Shooting the Past - reunites with producer John Chapman and composer Adrian Johnston to reveal the little-known story of Prince John, the epileptic youngest son of George V and Queen Mary, whose life was spent hidden away. Set during the First World War and the Russian Revolution, this is less a biopic than a meditation on a royal family in crisis. Poliakoff's seriously impressive cast includes Gina McKee and Michael Gambon and features outstanding performances from Miranda Richardson and Tom Hollander. DB \u00b7 BBC1, 19 &amp; 26 January 30 MASSIVE ATTACK'S 100TH WINDOW A great deal has happened to Massive Attack since 1998's Mezzanine began its slow burn into people's minds - perhaps part of the reason it has taken four years to produce a follow-up. First, there was the departure of Adrian 'Mushroom' Vowles. Then came various attempts to get the show back on the road, the most recent involving Robert '3D' del Naja and Grant 'Daddy Gee' Marshall teaming up with Lupine Howl (previously Jason Pierce's Spiritualized) and recording 80 hours of music - all of which was scrapped. Now Marshall appears to have taken time out, although, according to del Naja, 'he'll get into the swing of the music again when he comes on tour with us. He'll be back.' Given the absence of two-thirds of the original group, you might expect 100th Window - produced by del Naja and Neil Davidge - to be very different from its predecessors. And it is certainly an evolution. Where Mezzanine was dark and stark, this is lighter and altogether fuller. But it retains Massive Attack's trademark paranoid edge - the album is named after the book The Hundredth Window, by Charles Jennings and Lori Fena, which warns about electronic intrusions into individual privacy. Del Naja says: 'We wanted to make this album warmer than Mezzanine , but we didn't want to make it softer. We wanted to keep the intrigue, but without making it bleak.' Musically, the album is on a more electronic trip than Mezzanine; it begins and ends with a rhythmic electronic bleep, and cycling, filtered harmonics replace the guitars of the last offering. It's a masterpiece of programming, the same kicks, toms and insistent hi-hats pervading every track and giving it a consistent texture. Long-time collaborator Horace Andy takes on vocal duties on two tracks, 'Everywhen' and 'Name Taken', and sounds even more melancholy than he did on Protection (1994) and Mezzanine. Electronic insects feed in the background on the first track, while the latter trips off into narcotic bliss. Del Naja sings on several numbers, including the standouts 'Small Time Shot Away', with its recurring phrase 'It's my favourite chloroform', and 'Antistar', the album's final track. On this last, which features beautiful, slow oriental string arrangements and an oud-sounding flamenco motif, he sneers like Johnny Rotten, and you realise again where Tricky cut his teeth. The surprise - though it's a nice one - is Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. Massive Attack have always chosen well when it comes to female vocalists - think of Tracy Thorn on Protection and Liz Fraser's mind-blowing 'Teardrop' from Mezzanine - and O'Connor is superb on four numbers here. Her Celtic undertones come to the fore, and on the single 'Special Cases' (the shortest track on the album at just over five minutes) blend majestically with a threatening bassline and eastern strings. 'A Prayer for England'- an invocation to Jah that laments the killing of children and warns that 'your [Jah's] teachers are representing you so badly' - may not seem such a good idea in a few years, but musically it's top-notch, building to a fierce ending with an off-kilter, persistent bassline. Massive Attack continue to plough their own furrow, and 100th Window will be one of the albums of the year. It's a grower. MW \u00b7 100th Window is released on 10 February 31 THE DANCE OF DEATH The Dance of Death was an unlikely hit on Broadway, but Strindberg's play about the unravelling of a 25-year marriage is an emotional marathon which, played by a first-rate class, can be devastating. Sean Mathias's production, starring Ian McKellen, is coming, in a slightly reconstituted version, to the Lyric Theatre. Frances de la Tour, taking over the role acted by Helen Mirren in America, will play opposite McKellen - an arranged marriage with which Sean Mathias is said to be 'rightly' thrilled. He always thought they would make 'an amazing pair' and admits he has 'waited all year to get them'. KK \u00b7 Lyric Theatre, London W1 from 20 February 32 YOU SHALL KNOW OUR VELOCITY: DAVE EGGERS With A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, Dave Eggers announced himself not just as an outstanding writer, but also as a kind of all-singing, all-dancing publishing subversive, promoting, through his magazine and imprint, McSweeney's, a group of authors who tended to share his polished mix of tricksiness and confession. This knowing brilliance was always going to be a hard act to follow. Perhaps inevitably, then, this - his first novel proper - lives in the shadow of his 'memoir'. Will and Hand, restless, infinitely ironic American youths, embark on their own wealth redistribution project, travelling the world for a week doling out random cash in Senegal, Morocco, Estonia and Latvia. Eggers brings to this voyage of discovery his distinctive rhetorical invention, but the Salinger-esque voice begins to grate as the twenty-first-century Sal and Dean clock up the air miles. TA \u00b7 Published in February by Penguin 33 20 THINGS TO DO BEFORE YOU'RE 30 This isn't the ultimate lifestyle guide for anxious twentysomethings, but the new comedy drama series from the team behind This Life and Teachers. It follows four friends who tackle the onset of beginning a new decade by setting each other a series of bizarre tasks and reassessing their lives. 'Thirty is still the iconic number,' says producer Jane Fallon who devised the series while working on Teachers. 'It's when people compare their actual lives with what they think they should have achieved.' The cast are relative unknowns, including stand-up comedian Matthew Horne and Chris Polick, who left drama school and walked into his first screen role. 'We wanted to cast new people and surprise the audience,' says Fallon. 'We didn't want actors who were carrying any luggage from previous roles'. AO \u00b7 20 Things To Do Before You're 30 starts on C4 on 30 January 34 ACCIDENTAL DEATH OF AN ANARCHIST The constantly surprising career of Rhys Ifans gets another twist in 2003. Having moved from Twin Town through Dancing at Lughnasa and Notting Hill, the Welsh wizard gets to play a maniac in Dario Fo's farce, Accidental Death of An Anarchist. Ifans is amused by the notion that when the director Robert Delamere was on the look-out for someone to play a maniac, it was he who 'disturbingly sprang to mind'. And he's thrilled to be in a play that he first saw at Theatre Clwyd when he was a teenager. He took to it immediately: 'It had an energy to it, an irreverence and subversion that appealed to an angry 14-year-old.' Drawing on the real-life story of a political activist who 'fell' to his death from a window while in police custody, the play's satire caused a sensation when first staged in Italy in 1970, and Ifans is convinced it's an important drama to put on in a war-threatened world. Not, he's quick to point out, that there's anything 'worthy' about Fo's play: he likes the fact that it's known as 'the comic Hamlet'. And not that there'll be anything ponderous about the new Donmar translation, to be supplied by Simon Nye (Men Behaving Badly). The play's inclusion in Michael Grandage's first season as artistic director at the Donmar puts down a clear marker: Grandage is determined to take the theatre into Europe. And Ifans will be happy to go with him: he loves that Donmar smallness - 'it's like doing it in a lift'. SC \u00b7 Donmar, London WC2 from 20 February 35 THE LABAN CENTRE Despite the unlikely setting of the Laban Centre; a complex of dance studios at the centre of one of south-east London's least prepossessing bits of industrial dereliction, and a shoestring budget, it is already a strong contender for the title of the best new piece of architecture of the year. Herzog and de Meuron see no difference in working with an existing building, such as the old Bankside power station which they turned into Tate Modern, and creating an entirely new building. For the Laban, which officially opens in February, as for the Tate there is a play between inside and out. The Laban however demonstrates the vulnerability of the exterior, with its plastic skin, coloured in collaboration with the artist Michael Craig-Martin, and contrasts it with the toughness of the interior finishes. DS 36 RETURN OF THE PRODIGALS The Royal Ballet, led by director Monica Mason, is mending rifts by welcoming back dancers who left without due acknowledgement. Usually, a farewell performance is marked by emotional curtain calls, masses of flowers, 'We love you' banners in the audience and tears all round. Not for Tetsuya Kumakawa, who slipped away in 1998 to set up his own ballet company in Japan. He left Anthony Dowell, then the Royal Ballet's director, in the lurch by taking five men from the company with him. Forgiven at last, he has been invited to return as a guest from 5 to 26 April. He'll be dancing the pas de deux from Le Corsaire in a tribute programme to Rudolf Nureyev, who died in January 1993. Monica Mason has chosen ballets particularly associated with Nureyev, danced by a glittering array of stars, including Sylvie Guillem, Laurent Hilaire and Carlos Acosta, as well as Kumakawa. April also marks the return of Irek Mukhamedov, airbrushed out of the Royal Ballet's hierarchy the moment Ross Stretton arrived from Australia to replace Dowell. Mukhamedov was told there were no roles for him, so he exited by default. Once Stretton was ejected, Mason invited Mukhamedov back for a triple bill commemorating the tenth anniversary of Kenneth MacMillan's death. A South Bank Show about what he's been up to in the meantime is due to be screened on 19 January. JP \u00b7 Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020 7304 4000), 5 April - 14 May. 37 ZAHA HADID Zaha Hadid's first major project has been a long time coming. Her career has been measured out in unbuilt designs from Hong Kong to Cardiff, and quirky follies, fire stations and ski jumps. But when the Rosenthal Centre for Contemporary Art opens its new building in Cincinnati in May, this British-based architect will show us how she deals with a complex range of uses within an urban context. It will shortly be followed by equally substantial projects in Germany and Italy. The centre accommodates a temporary exhibition space, as well as the usual accompaniments of museum-going; shop, cafe, offices, and education space, piled up into a six storey structure that has to seduce visitors with its striking presence. DS 38 PATTERN RECOGNITION: WILLIAM GIBSON A new book by William Gibson is always an exciting event. After all, this is the self-confessed technophobe who wrote Neuromancer, and introduced the world to cyberspace and cyberpunks. Pattern Recognition, his seventh novel, is notable for being set in London one year after 11 September, and the business of imagining the future takes a back seat to the complexities of the modern world. In a tip of the hat to Naomi Klein, the heroine, Cayce Pollard, makes her living through an unusual sensitivity to corporate branding. When a toothsome ad executive asks her to investigate the source of a mysterious phenomenon on the internet, which could be the most important viral marketing campaign ever devised, Cayce soon becomes entangled in a world of paranoid surveillance and commodity fetishism. Pattern Recognition is a stylish and ambitious novel. Equal parts detective story, travelogue and cultural satire, it is also (dare I say it) about one woman's quest for emotional fulfilment, and proof of Gibson's growing maturity as a writer. BY \u00b7 Pattern Recognition is published in February by Viking 39 JACK NICHOLSON At the Cannes Film Festival last year, the critics reserved the biggest laugh of the fortnight for Jack Nicholson, when, looking every day of his 65 years, he wakes up next to his dowdy sexagenarian wife in About Schmidt. After his wife dies, everyman Schmidt embarks on a comic journey across the Midwest in order to contemplate his life. Nicholson says: 'This is the least vain performance I think I've ever given.' His portrait of the retired insurance salesman is an acting lesson that has made him the early favourite for the Best Actor Oscar. The familiar rakish grin and half-cocked eyebrows are replaced by a series of doleful expressions. Director Alexander Payne (Election) adapted the script from Louis Begley's novel, changing the wealthy and confident businessman Warren Schmidt into a hardworking stiff, then offered Nicholson the most unlikely role of his career. 'He made it very easy,' Payne has said. 'He was willing and able to do anything that the film required.' AO \u00b7 About Schmidt opens on 24 January 40 GARTH FAGAN DANCES Choreographer of The Lion King, Garth Fagan has run his own African-American dance company in upstate New York for 32 years. Its Sadler's Wells season will be the first time the 15 dancers have appeared in London, though the company tours widely outside as well as in the United States. They're spectacular performers, trained in Fagan's own dance technique, which combines ballet with the earthiness and energy of Afro-Caribbean dance. Fagan, born in Jamaica, is much in demand as a choreographer: he has been commissioned by the Alvin Ailey Dance Company, Dance Theatre of Harlem and New York City Ballet - though The Lion King has made him internationally famous. His company is bringing two programmes as an introduction to his work. They include Prelude, showing how dancers train to be expressive: then comes the intoxicating Woza (Zulu for 'come celebrate') to music by Lebo M, South African composer of The Lion King; and Mix 25, to an eclectic range of music by Wynton Marsalis, Brahms, John Cage and Foday Musa Suso. JP \u00b7 Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (020 7863 8000), 4-8 March. 41 SECOND GENERATION Last year, the success of films such as Monsoon Wedding and Bend it like Beckham and Andrew Lloyd Webber's Bombay Dreams musical highlighted a popular interest in contemporary Asian culture. This year, Second Generation, a sprawling two-part C4 drama set in Southall and Calcutta, aims to capitalise on it. The story is simple: Christopher Simpson (White Teeth) and Parminder Nagra (Bend it like Beckham) once childhood sweethearts, now successful young professionals, fall in love, causing a multitude of problems. It's time-honoured star-crossed lovers stuff given a modern spin. 'We're trying to make a drama which will feel both fresh and timely,' says producer Nicholas Kent. 'At its heart is a love story which captures the pulse of life in Britain.' AO \u00b7 Second Generation will be shown in the spring 42 LEONARDO DICAPRIO Five years ago Leonardo DiCaprio was on the brink of becoming the biggest star in the world. Titanic was breaking international box-office records, while the young actor combined the restless spirit of Montgomery Clift with the teeny-bopper appeal of Donny Osmond. Then he misfired in The Beach, becoming a tabloid fixture for his late-night exploits rather than his day job. DiCaprio's career rehabilitation should occur through leading roles in two new films, directed by Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. In Scorsese's Gangs of New York, he is an aspiring gangster bent an avenging his father's death, but his most memorable performance is in Spielberg's romp Catch Me If You Can, in which he plays real-life conman Frank Abagnale, who charmed and tricked his way across America in the Sixties. AO \u00b7 Gangs of New York opens on 10 January, Catch Me If You Can on 31 January 43 GRAHAM SWIFT: THE LIGHT OF DAY Graham Swift hit the headlines in April last year when he jumped from the Picador ship and returned to his first publisher, Penguin. The furore continued when it came to light that Swift intended to sell the republishing rights for his previous eight titles at the same time. The deal cut with Penguin was rumoured at about the \u00a3400,000 mark. The Light of Day is his first novel since Last Orders, which won the Booker Prize in 1996, and was made into a film in 2001 starring Michael Caine, Helen Mirren and Bob Hoskins. This new tale is another incisive character study. Sarah is in prison, and is visited once a fortnight by George Webb, the private investigator she hired to follow her husband's affair. The relationship becomes a consuming one for George. Swift has said of The Light of Day: 'It is my most optimistic book.' KdG \u00b7 The Light of Day is published on 6 March by Hamish Hamilton 44 NEW US SHOWS With long-running US show Ally McBeal and Friends surely finishing any year now, British fans of quality imports will welcome replacements. This month, the most promising new drama to debut on American television last year, Boomtown, starts on C5. The cop show has the feel of a noir thriller, but its unique selling point is the Rashomon-device in each episode whereby the crime is re-run and dissected from various points of view. Steven Spielberg devised and produced Taken (BBC 2, January), a 10-part series about alien abduction that cost $40 million and took three years to make. It is similar in scope and ambition to Spielberg's previous TV project, Band of Brothers. The Pitts are a dysfunctional sitcom family in the tradition of The Simpsons, likewise cursed with bad luck and a terrible credit rating. AO \u00b7 Taken starts this month on BBC2, Boomtown starts 28 January on C5 and The Pitts will air on ITV in March 45 DAYS LIKE THESE Three years ago, the Tate held its first triennial exhibition of contemporary British art. Some people thought it might be the last. The selection of 'representative' artists was controversial. There was very little quality control - a disproportionate ratio of duffers and duds. Even the show's theme seemed to have been conceived in a moment of inattention. 'Intelligence': what a hostage to fortune. This time there is no theme and the 22 artists have been selected purely for 'the vitality of their recent work'. All the usual media are included, plus sound and photography. The exhibition ranges from recent college graduates to some of Britain's most senior artists - Richards, Deacon and Hamilton. In fact, the cast list looks remarkably like a calculated crowd-puller: starring, among others, Cornelia Parker, Rachel Whiteread and Peter Doig. LC \u00b7 Tate Britain, London SW1, 27 Feb-26 May. 46 '8 MILE' SOUNDTRACK Eminem's convincing performance in his debut film 8 Mile was a surprise. But few people were astonished when the excellent soundtrack sold half a million copies in the first week in the US. In the film, Eminem plays a fledgling Detroit rapper, but he only appears on three tracks on the soundtrack, which was released on his own label, Shady Records. Instead he handpicked a number of unsigned rappers from the hip-hop underground, including 50 Cent, Obie Trice and Young Zee, alongside established names such as Macy Gray and Jay-Z. The newcomers' urban nihilism owes much to their mentor, while Eminem deserves credit for introducing a new generation of rappers. AO \u00b7 8 Mile is released on 17 January 47 FASHION AND TEXTILES MUSEUM 'I did safety pins 10 years before Versace, and a lipstick-print design about 20 years before Prada. You can get knotted up thinking: \"Why aren't I making any money out of this?\", but then you're not going to get any work done. In the meantime, at least one can be thought of as the guru of it all.' So says Zandra Rhodes, who has converted a disused cash and carry warehouse in Bermondsey, south London, with the help of Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, into the rainbow-coloured Fashion and Textiles Museum. The opening exhibition showcases 65 designers from around the world, including John Galliano, Dolce and Gabbana, and Alexander McQueen. Each has submitted what they personally consider to be the best dress they ever designed and given an explanation for their choice. The museum is aiming to run three shows each year, as well as courses and lectures. No less than 3,000 of Zandra's original frocks will also be on display. KdG \u00b7 Zandra Rhodes's Fashion &amp; Textile Museum opens in the spring 48 GEORGE CLOONEY AND STEVE SODERBERGH 2002 was an extraordinary year for George Clooney and director Steven Soderbergh. They ruled the box-office with their Brat Pack remake Ocean's Eleven, while their production company, Section Eight, was behind two critical favourites, Insomnia and Far From Heaven. Since they first teamed up in Out of Sight (1998), the film that revitalised their careers, the friends haven't put a foot wrong, though they are not afraid to take risks. Their latest collaboration is the most challenging yet - a remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's philosophical sci-fi, Solaris. 'Solaris is a mind-bender in the best sense of the word,' one leading critic said approvingly. US audiences haven't been as welcoming to the arthouse offering, but it won't deter the pair from continuing to do the unexpected. AO \u00b7 Solaris opens on 28 February 49 TERRY RILEY High priest of the 1970s New Age Movement, Californian composer Terry Riley was the natural choice when Nasa approached the Kronos Quartet to commission a piece to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Voyager space mission. Groups from The Who to Tangerine Dream have been as influenced by Riley's work as have minimalist composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Adams. So it will be a momentous evening at the Barbican on 22 March, as Voyager continues to hurtle around the solar system, when Riley's friend and Kronos's founder David Harrington leads the quartet and an 80-strong choir in the resulting work, Sun Rings, with visuals designed by U2 and Rolling Stones collaborator Willie Williams.

Burroughs starts out with an uninterested father and a mad mother. So he's packed off to live with his mother's shrink, but the shrink is nuts too. Part harrowing, part hilarious, the tale barrels along helped by snippy dialogue and oddball characters. Burroughs has been accused of inventing aspects of his childhood but who cares - you're just thankful to read a memoir that is genuinely memorable, not mawkish.
