So let's go straight to number 10: I want a baby, but I don't want to be a parent. They are weird. Looking at parents from a distance, what's always struck me is the massive preponderance of sentences that start, \"What you'll find ... \" and \"You think that now, but ... \" People ask you amazingly obvious questions, such as, \"Are you going to buy some baby clothes?\", and they don't mean them in a straightforward way. They mean, \"I'm worried you're going to do this wrong, but I am too passive-aggressive to actually say so; instead I shall use this Socratic questioning method.\" The other day, I was having a cup of coffee (I am quite ginormous now: people have totally stopped looking at my face, and started staring at my stomach. I suddenly understand what it's like to have really great - though quite low-slung - breasts), and an acquaintance accosted me and said, \"What are you drinking?\" with such force that I thought maybe the foetus had burrowed a peephole and was mouthing, \"Please! Help me! Not another double espresso! I wanted milk!\" Should I tell her about the Danish study, the largest ever compiled, that showed up to 17 cups a day of coffee had a neutral to mildly positive effect on foetal health? Well, I would, only I can't be bothered, and plus, nobody used to come up to me when I was on my 17th tequila and say, \"What are you drinking?\" Ach, maybe they did. Maybe I can't remember. Early on in the pregnancy, I assumed this was because everyone, everywhere, secretly struggles with the urge to tell one another what to do. The more you know you can't - that is, the older you get - the more you really, really want to. At the point of conception, when you magically become two people, everyone is suddenly freed from their restraint because they're not doing it to you, they're doing it on someone else's behalf. It is not unlike that boarding school convention where you're not allowed to ask anyone to pass you the jam, you have to ask your neighbour if she wants the jam, and then say primly, \"Please could you pass Whatserface the jam?\" I have since changed my mind about this, on the new evidence that it is only parents who ever do this to you (return for a second to the caffeine-fearing acquaintance, who has just offered me a cocktail sausage, and when I demurred, said, \"You probably killed your appetite with all that coffee!\" Seriously, transpose that for a second to a tequila-drinking lady who isn't pregnant, and refuses a Dorito. Can you imagine an acquaintance saying, \"You probably killed your appetite for finger food with all that alcohol\"? Which one of these people would not be invited back?) Ergo, it cannot be a universal desire, the bossiness; it's only parents, and what do they all have in common? Well, children for a sodding start. You'd think they'd be able to take all their overbearing instincts out on them. But they also share the fear that they're not doing it right; the best way to counter this uncertainty is to make sure that at least everyone else is doing it exactly the same. This brings out the most florid failures of courtesy in otherwise normal people. Some publisher sent me a book called 99 Ways to Stop Yourself Going Mad When You're a Mother, and number 45 is: \"Next time a working mother says, 'I'd go mad if I stayed at home. At least by working I'm using my brain', you now have the perfect put-down: 'Oh, I don't have a brain ... but that's OK 'cos none of the doctors or lawyers I meet at coffee mornings have brains either.' If the woman in question has really got up your nose, you could add: 'Still, I was clever enough to find a man who could keep me'.\" That is seriously what it said. Right there in print - \"I was clever enough to find a man who could keep me.\" Never mind the passing drollery of writing a how-to book about not going mad when you are clearly already stark, staring bonkers, what is the matter with these people? Why do people who eschew the nursery and stay off work need everyone else to do the same? Why can't you enjoy a macrobiotic diet on your own time? Why do you care whether someone else is feeding their one-year-old a crisp? You never used to care when you saw someone wearing too-high heels, and being drunk, and standing too near the edge of a train platform. That's way more dangerous than a crisp. You bunch of mum loonies!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
