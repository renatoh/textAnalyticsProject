The midfielder turned down the chance to join Manchester United before he left Ajax for Milan in 1996 and recalls his chat with Sir Alex Ferguson. \"I think it was the best conversation I ever had with a manager,\" the Tottenham player said, reflecting that he had been \"very close\" to moving to United. He refused to divulge what was said but did say: \"When I talked to him at the time he made a big impression.\" Ferguson's team and Old Trafford have not been kind to Davids since then. With Juventus he lost a dramatic Champions League semi-final to United in 1999 and, four years later, suffered defeat in the final to Milan in Manchester. A change of fortune with Spurs would be welcome. Tottenham begin in second place, United a point behind in third with a game in hand, and Davids acknowledges that this match and the following one at home to Arsenal will indicate much about his latest club's standing. Their only Premiership defeat so far has come against the leaders Chelsea. \"They are big games and then we can see what level we are at,\" Davids said. \"It's not going to determine the rest of the season but it's always nice to know on which level you are when you play the very big teams. That's absolutely Manchester United and Arsenal even though they are behind us.\" The Dutchman says he has no regrets about rejecting United - \"no, because I didn't do bad myself\" - but talks admiringly of the club's spirit and believes that they have set the benchmark in England over recent years. \"When they have to be there in the big games they always stand up,\" he said. \"They have this big heart.\" It is something that he and the Spurs head coach, Martin Jol, are trying to instil at White Hart Lane. \"We would love to have that but it's a mentality and also something you grow up with [at a club],\" said Davids, 32. \"When you have that every day it can become second nature. It's also second nature for me.\" There will be no Keane-Davids clash tomorrow because of the Irishman's injury but Davids will come up against his compatriots Ruud van Nistelrooy and Edwin van der Sar and picks Paul Scholes as one of the world's best midfielders. Davids' experience and aggression have helped Tottenham to make a good start in the league and he is positive about the club's future. \"It's really exciting,\" he said, before adding: \"This is what I thought would happen but we are still at the beginning with a young squad, so everything is possible. The main thing now is to stay consistent.\" Ryan Giggs will undergo an operation after fracturing his cheekbone during United's Champions League draw with Lille on Tuesday. The Welsh winger initially played on after sustaining the blow during the second half of the drab 0-0 draw but it soon became apparent that he was badly hurt when he was replaced by Park Ji-sung seven minutes from time. Ferguson stated immediately after the game that Giggs had been caught by an elbow from the former Arsenal defender Stathis Tavlaridis, although he was unable to say whether it was deliberate.The Scot has not spoken further about the clash but after an examination by United's medical staff surgery was deemed appropriate. United are already without a host of stars, including Keane, Gary Neville and Gabriel Heinze. The United manager has clearly written the veteran winger out of tomorrow's encounter and, though club officials do not yet know for how long Giggs will be sidelined, it is likely to be weeks rather than days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
