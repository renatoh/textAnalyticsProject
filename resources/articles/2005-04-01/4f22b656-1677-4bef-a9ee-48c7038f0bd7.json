The Dow suffered a 420-point loss in the final three days of last week amid fears that the American economy was beginning to falter. It slipped another 16 points on Monday as investors searched company earnings for clues on the economy, with little apparent success.

The US labour department reported only a 0.1% gain in prices during March, excluding energy and food.

It reported a 12% gain in profits to $411m (\u00a3214m) and said the pace of demand was picking up. The shares were trading 6% higher at $24.26.

Merrill Lynch reported a 3% fall in first-quarter profits to $1.2bn and said the difficult environment in March had accelerated in April.

The smaller Wells Fargo and US Bancorp both reported record quarterly earnings. Johnson &amp; Johnson beat Wall Street forecasts. Viacom, the media conglomerate that owns MTV, reported a 15% jump in the first three months to $508m, after stripping out a tax gain last year. Revenues were 5% higher at $5.6bn on the back of a strong performance from cable networks. Taser, the stun-gun maker, posted a sharp drop in first quarter earnings after the controversy raging over the safety of its weapons. Profits were $168,000 in the first three months, compared with $3.6m a year ago. The shares fell 10 cents to $7.87 in mid-day trade. They reached a high of $32.59 in December.
