In his role as IAAF president, there has been nothing but a litany of corruption claims, doping cover-ups, bruising battles with Vladimir Putin and damaging allegations that threaten his own credibility. But now, hanging up one of his many hats and enjoying the appreciation of the first gathering of British Olympic sports since their Rio success, Lord Coe is on surer ground. After the former sports minister Hugh Robertson was elected to succeed him as British Olympic Association chairman, Coe cuts a substantially more relaxed figure than he did 12 months ago at the height of the crisis that brought athletics to a new low. Standing down after four years in which the BOA has been put back on an even keel financially, cut costs and shed extraneous responsibilities to focus on its core mission and come home from Rio with a record haul of medals, Coe says it is the right time to hand the baton on to another former Tory MP. \u201cI\u2019m not a great believer in hanging around interminably,\u201d he said of his decision to leave the BOA after four years as chair. \u201cI also recognised that what we did in those four years would probably define the organisation for a long time to come.\u201dWhen he agreed to chair the BOA, Coe was still basking in the glory of his role as London 2012 chairman and pondering a run at the presidency of the International Association of Athletics Federations. \u201cI probably would not have done this under normal circumstances. It\u2019s just that this was an organisation I pretty much owed everything to,\u201d he says of his decision to take on the role. He credits the BOA with enabling his gold medal in Moscow in 1980 in the face of a boycott and opposition from Margaret Thatcher to the British team going. \u201cA large part of my life was defined by Moscow. I owed them something, I really did,\u201d he says. Following the expansionist tenure of his predecessor, Lord Moynihan, Coe says that there was \u201cchronic fragility\u201d in the balance sheet when he arrived. \u201cWe also had to break the feast to famine type cycle. I\u2019m delighted that this is the first quad we\u2019ve come out of where we\u2019ve actually got some money in the bank,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a combination of cutting costs but also, I like to think, if I have any skill it\u2019s hiring the right people.\u201d Coe pared back the BOA\u2019s role, returning it to a focused mission as the organisation responsible for delivering British athletes to the Games in peak condition. He also hired Bill Sweeney, a former Puma executive, as chief executive, who signed a string of sponsors that have eased its financial woes. Relations with UK Sport, the funding agency that dispenses national lottery and exchequer cash to Olympic sports and helped fuel Team GB\u2019s best haul in more than a century in Rio, were also restored to harmony after a spate of turf wars. On the debate that has bubbled away since Rio on whether the no compromise principles that underpinned that Olympic success have somehow gone too far, Coe is unequivocal. \u201cThe elite legacy is powerful. I was in Doha to pick up the national Olympic committee of the year award and everyone wanted 30 seconds of our time to ask how on earth we do this,\u201d he says. If the legacy for elite sport secured by London 2012 is clear, the picture at the grassroots is much more mixed. Coe, like many great former athletes, falls back on his instinctive belief that there is a link between top-level success and grassroots growth. \u201cIt\u2019s not a straightforward linear equation but I will always instinctively feel that Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton are responsible for one million more cyclists from 2008 to 2012. \u201cIt won\u2019t work in every sport. But how many more girls are now joining hockey clubs? I don\u2019t need the numbers to know that is what is happening. I just speak to people in my own local.\u201d He accepts that inactivity and childhood obesity remain one of the country\u2019s biggest failing but continues to maintain that the \u00a39bn investment in the London Olympics did help. \u201cThe worst you can probably say about it is that we stemmed the flow. We were haemorrhaging.\u201d Which is quite a long way from inspire a generation but perhaps more realistic. Coe also wants to set the record straight on another topical legacy issue \u2013 the unhappy story of the Olympic Stadium, with its spiralling costs and hitherto problematic marriage of football and athletics. \u201cThere is a little bit of retrofitting history here. You could not get in the door of the clubs because no one thought we were going to win this. We went to the clubs. West Ham were in receivership, Tottenham just didn\u2019t want to open the door,\u201d he says. \u201cThe commitment we made was a commitment we made across four organisations when we took that bid to Singapore and it needed to be honoured.\u201d Despite the bonhomie around the BOA\u2019s offices, it is impossible to avoid returning to Coe\u2019s other role as IAAF president. Ask about continuing investigations into payments made by the son of now disgraced former president Lamine Diack to Coe\u2019s former right-hand man Nick Davies and he says he just does not know, arguing the IAAF\u2019s independent ethics committee is operating as exactly that. Likewise, the recent French reports that appeared to confirm a 2014 Guardian story that Diack\u2019s son, Papa Massata, requested millions of dollars in payments from a Qatar investment company. \u201cWe have a French prosecution that is still underway. We\u2019re still awaiting the outcome of the CAS [court of arbitration for sport] discussions of last week and we\u2019ve still got an ethics board review,\u201d Coe says. \u201cI have always been very clear about this. If any evidence comes to light that shows that any of these bids have in any way been manipulated then the answer is that of course we will look at them.\u201d But whatever pain there may yet be to come in the shark-infested waters of international sports politics, at home Coe can reflect on a discreet four-year turnaround job. The proof, he says, was in the Rio medal haul. \u201cI just hope that going forward, when the public expenditure rounds are settled and the decisions are made, that we just ponder on one thing: we are the best in the world at this,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nobody that does it better, there is nobody that does it with more meticulous planning. We are the envy of the world and you don\u2019t cede that ground easily.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
