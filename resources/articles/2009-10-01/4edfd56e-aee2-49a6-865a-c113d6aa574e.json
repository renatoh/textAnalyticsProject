As a veteran of derbies from Manchester to Munich to Merseyside, London to Spain, the former United, Bayern, Everton, Chelsea and Barcelona striker was once asked how Blackburn Rovers versus Burnley compared in his experience of local enmity. \"Good God,\" he replied. \"That one's mad.\" Few in east Lancashire will dispute Hughes's sentiment. It is permissible to romanticise the \"cotton mill derby\", which resumes as a top-flight fixture for the first time in 43 years on Sunday, given its insular nature is one in the eye for those who pine for a 39th game while denying the game is losing touch with its roots. This is an antidote to those ambitions, although those who consider it no more than a rivalry between founding members of the Football League are mistaken. \"People south of these towns don't understand how big this is,\" said Rovers' New Zealand-born captain, Ryan Nelsen. \"I get asked by silly reporters if it's like an All Blacks-Australia game. I've been to several All Black-Australia games and they are an absolute yawn festival compared to this thing.\" The intensity of \"Nay Cl\u00e1sico\" does astonish. All 3,000 Burnley supporters with tickets for Ewood Park are under police orders to report to Turf Moor at 9.15am tomorrow and make the 14-mile journey between the stadiums in a convoy of coaches \u2013 even the poor Burnley season-ticket holder who lives a four-minute walk from Ewood and wished to escort his Blackburn-following grandfather to the game. There is no other way in or out of the police cordon for Burnley fans, with the exception of disabled supporters. They must submit their name, vehicle make and registration to Lancashire police before being allowed to join the convoy. Close proximity and the derby's rarity are two theories for the antagonism that exists. \"It doesn't come around very often whereas other derbies in the country are routine, pretty standard. That is why this one has got more of a special edge,\" says Nelsen. But it does not explain all. The rivals have not met since an FA Cup fifth-round replay in 2005 and the violent aftermath of the first tie at Turf Moor is the reason for tomorrow's travel arrangements. They last met in the league in April 2001, when Rovers triumphed 5-0 (commemorative T-shirts of an eight-year-old Championship victory are now on sale in the club shop) and have not met in a top-flight match since New Year's Day 1966. Burnley have not beaten Rovers for 30 years, and arguably harbour the deeper resentment. \"I was naive about this fixture at first,\" adds Nelsen. \"I remember being in the dressing room at Turf Moor and the Blackburn fans were already in their seats. It was two hours before kick-off. The stand was rattling and you could hear the vibrations in the dressing room and I thought, 'Hang on, this is something else'. It was pretty hostile on the pitch. When Morten [Gamst Pedersen] scored in the 86th minute of the replay to put us 2-1 up I've never to this day heard an eruption of noise like it. The fans will always have a soft spot in their hearts for Morten because of that goal.\" Nelsen is being diplomatic. Several fans invaded the pitch in the first meeting and one targeted Robbie Savage before his team-mates intervened. This week the Jack Walker statue outside Ewood was draped in a Clarets' shirt. Blackburn fans retaliated by daubing the James Hargreaves Stand at Turf Moor in graffiti. The hostilities, so local folklore has it, nosedived in May 1991 when Burnley lost a Fourth Division play-off to Torquay and were consigned to another season of fighting for their league status, and financial survival, as a result. Just when matters could not get any worse a plane flew overhead carrying a banner that read, \"Staying down forever luv Rovers Ha Ha Ha\". Forgiveness does not appear in the offing from supporters who chanted \"Bring on the bastards\" throughout Burnley's recent defeat of Birmingham City. The east Lancashire rumour mill had it that Blackburn's all-time leading goalscorer and cult hero, Simon Garner, was responsible for the fly-over that rubbed Burnley noses in the dirt. \"I just wish it was true,\" admits Garner, who will be leaving his painting and decorating job in London behind tomorrow to attend the game. \"I'm always asked about how I arranged that plane to fly over but I didn't do it, although I know who did.\" Garner scored in every game he played against Burnley, whether for Rovers or for West Bromwich Albion, and put Emmanuel Adebayor to shame with his provocative celebrations. \"I remember scoring two penalties against Burnley in 1983 and as I was running up to take the second, bricks were being thrown on the pitch,\" he said. \"After scoring against Burnley in one game for Rovers I was leaving the ground and there was one of them outside in the car park waving a knife around. He asked me if I had seen Simon Garner because he wanted to stab him. I just said 'no' and ran to the players' bar.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2009.
