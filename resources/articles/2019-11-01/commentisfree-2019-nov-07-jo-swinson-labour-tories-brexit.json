That\u2019s just not true", "bodyText": "Once upon a time, words had meanings. Take \u201cmerge\u201d, for example \u2013 to \u201cblend gradually into something else so as to become indistinguishable from it\u201d, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Apparently it means something else to the Liberal Democrats. How else to explain Jo Swinson\u2019s inexplicable claim this week that Labour and the Tories \u201cmerge into one\u201d on Brexit? Are Labour and the Tories indistinguishable on the subject? Labour promises a second referendum with remain on the ballot. The Tories do not. Labour is promising to negotiate a relatively soft Brexit deal as the other option in the referendum vote. The Tories are pledging a hard Brexit. The one constant in Labour\u2019s shifting Brexit stance since 2016 has been opposition to no deal. The Tories are leaving no deal firmly on the table, keeping alive the possibility of an EU crash-out at the end of 2020. Swinson is not a disengaged voter, or a hyperbolic keyboard warrior. She is a party leader. She knows Labour and the Tories are not the same. When she says they \u201cmerge into one\u201d on Brexit, she is lying. She won\u2019t be the only one, of course, during what is already shaping up to be a wretchedly mendacious election. But what particularly rankles about Swinson\u2019s dishonesty is that Labour has more or less adopted the Lib Dems\u2019 own policy from 2017. Two years ago, her party\u2019s manifesto stated: \u201cWhen the terms of our future relationship with the EU have been negotiated (over the next two years on the government\u2019s timetable), we will put that deal to a vote of the British people in a referendum, with the alternative option of staying in the EU on the ballot paper.\u201d The only difference between that and Labour\u2019s policy now is that Tim Farron\u2019s manifesto was explicit that there was no Brexit deal as good as remaining. Labour remains ambiguous, with Jeremy Corbyn refusing to say whether he\u2019d back leave or remain once a new \u201cLabour Brexit\u201d deal has been negotiated. Labour is neither pro- nor anti-Brexit in that sense, though its MPs are mostly pro-remain. Does this ambiguity matter? Arguably not. Labour\u2019s uncertainty relates to its stance in a referendum, not on a referendum. How many people in 2020 are going to decide their vote on Brexit based on what Corbyn thinks? David Cameron had far more support among Tory voters in 2016 than Corbyn did, yet most Tory voters backed leave. It\u2019s clear that Labour has nobody to blame but itself for continuity remainers\u2019 lack of trust in it. Corbyn called for article 50 to be invoked the day after the referendum. After successfully facing both ways on Brexit during the 2017 election, the party hierarchy got drunk on its own hubris in the following years, convinced it had found the winning formula to keep its electoral coalition on board. But as remainers coalesced around demands for a people\u2019s vote, especially before the 2019 European elections, Labour found itself disastrously behind the curve, allowing the Lib Dems to rise from the dead. Labour took remain voters for granted as if they had nowhere else to go. They went. Yet though Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto committed to delivering Brexit, its 2019 manifesto will not. Labour will offer people\u2019s vote campaigners what they asked for. The idea that this is the behaviour of a pro-Brexit party will be news to actual Brexiters. There are plenty of logical reasons not to vote Labour at this election \u2013 antisemitism, national security, the leadership\u2019s tendency to respond to any problem by seeking more control for itself. But the Lib Dems, in their desperation to cast Labour as a pro-Brexit party, have created a fake news factory. Labour may be unfit for office \u2013 but it is not the same as the Tories on Brexit. \u2022 Chaminda Jayanetti is a journalist who covers politics and public services"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
