Their collection filled two whole floors of a house in Fore Street and, as one of the first film museums, it became a focal point for scholars worldwide. The collection continued to grow as William, based in London, hunted for the marvellous at ephemera fairs and auctions, and ran an antiques stall dedicated to photography and cinema. The museum, where John's wife Carmen was assistant curator, closed in 1986; by then he was recognised as a great expert in the field, and he continued to devote ever more time to his work as a historian. He was born in London. His father was involved with WH Barnes, piano manufacturers. John, together with William, developed an early passion for film. In the 1930s, they made films together of Kent and Cornwall, and while at Canford school in Dorset, they ran its cinema. In 1939, they studied film technique and design at the studio of Edward Carrick, in Soho Square, London, and bought several Victorian optical toys from a bookshop in Cecil Court, off Charing Cross Road. This was the start of their collection and of their ambition for it to represent the history of moving pictures from the 17th to the 20th centuries, including magic lanterns, shadow play, panoramas, dioramas, silhouettes, peepshows and the early forms of cinema. After wartime service in the Royal Navy, the brothers moved to St Ives and resumed their collecting. John began to research and write on the histories associated with what they found. An early essay, Dr Paris's Thaumatrope or Wonder-Turner, examined the origins of this early 19th-century philosophical toy and its place in the evolution of vision technology. (The thaumatrope is a card with pictures on each side, which is attached to two pieces of string. When the card is spun, the two images appear to combine into a single image because of the persistence of vision.) Based in a studio that had been used by the painter James McNeill Whistler (and by the twins' mother, Garlick Barnes, a still-life painter who had been a pupil of Walter Sickert), the twins specialised in the 1950s in dealing in secondhand books related to the moving image. They organised the first exhibition based on the collection in St Ives in 1951, and in 1956 objects were loaned to an Observer exhibition, Sixty Years of Cinema. Contact with Henri Langlois of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise led to John being asked to help establish a Mus\u00e9e du Cinema in Paris. He did not take up this invitation, establishing his own museum instead. There was a plan to move the museum collection from St Ives to London in the mid-1980s, but contractual problems prevented this. After the museum's closure, its pre-cinema artefacts, including exquisite painted lantern slides, were acquired by the Museo Nazionale del Cinema in Turin, and part of the early cinema collection found a new home at Hove museum and art gallery. This included cameras, projectors and material associated with the Brighton School of film pioneers - George Albert Smith, James Williamson and Alfred Darling - for which John had a particular fascination. John's greatest contribution to the study of his subject was his five-volume opus The Beginnings of the Cinema in England, 1894-1901, a comprehensive investigation that charts the medium's technological, cultural, economic and geographical development. It was founded on a careful examination of surviving films (largely from the collection of the British Film Institute) and business records, autobiographical accounts, venue programmes and trade periodicals relevant to film and the complementary subjects of music hall, photography and the magic lantern. The Barnes collection provided a significant amount of this primary material. John's methodology demonstrates the need for the historian to dig deep and wide; his painstaking research, an activity that he shared with his brother, can best be described as film archaeology. His major reference work will always serve as an essential tool for historians and archivists with interests in these formative years of British cinema. In 1997 John and William Barnes were awarded the Jean Mitry prize by the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy for their distinguished contribution to silent cinema. In 2006 they received honorary doctorates from Stirling University. In recent years, the films they made in the 1930s, engaging records of farming, fishing and Romany life near Canterbury, have found new and admiring audiences. Always ready to defend passionately his own interpretation of his subject's history, John was the epitome of the independent researcher, working steadfastly for decades without any institutional support. He is survived by Carmen, whom he married in the early 1960s; his son William from his first marriage, which ended in divorce; and his brother. \u00b7 John Stuart Lloyd Barnes, film historian and collector, born June 28 1920; died June 1 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
