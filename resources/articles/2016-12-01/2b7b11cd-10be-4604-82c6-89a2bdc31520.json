Not for the first time, the inner resolve that has been absent from recent title challenges but Arsene Wenger has detected this season was found wanting. His post-match criticism of the referee, Mark Clattenburg, could not detract from a restorative night for Ronald Koeman. Ashley Williams\u2019s textbook header in the 86th minute sealed a spirited comeback by an Everton side who had won only once in 11 matches. They were devoid of confidence, adventure and accuracy for the opening half-hour and Arsenal were on course for a comfortable win that would see them replace Chelsea at the top of the table. But then Everton and Goodison roused. Ross Barkley, James McCarthy and Aaron Lennon of all people snapped into a series of challenges and the mood transformed. Arsenal faded, and Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s woeful defending for Everton\u2019s winner \u2013 backing away as Barkley\u2019s corner arrived at the penalty spot \u2013 was an alarming sight for a manager with designs on the title. Wenger erred in his complaint over a corner in the build-up to Everton\u2019s winner but was correct to inject a sense of perspective after the game. This was Arsenal\u2019s first away defeat in the Premier League since 28 February after all, their first loss since the opening game of the season and they are in the midst of a gruelling schedule. But the return of a familiar flaw \u2013 \u201cYou go face to face,\u201d Koeman said after his latest managerial win against Arsenal \u2013 will be a cause for disquiet at the Emirates Stadium. There was still time for a remarkable finale after Williams\u2019s header. Phil Jagielka picked up a second yellow card for pulling back substitute Lucas P\u00e9rez and as a consequence the Everton captain will miss the Merseyside derby next week. From the resulting free-kick, with Petr Cech challenging his counterpart Maarten Stekelenburg, there was mayhem as S\u00e9amus Coleman blocked from Nacho Monreal, Leighton Baines did likewise from Alex Iwobi on the goal-line, Alexis S\u00e1nchez appealed for a penalty against Barkley, and Everton broke but were somehow unable to release a shot on a goal missing its goalkeeper. There was no time to rue the miss and Koeman, having called for more aggression before kick-off, was rewarded not only with three valuable points but vastly improved contributions from Barkley, McCarthy and Enner Valencia, making his first league start for the club. The Everton manager had claimed his squad were unbalanced and lacking both physically and mentally on the eve of Arsenal\u2019s visit and his concerns were borne out during a poor opening. Arsenal, with S\u00e1nchez\u2019s movement spreading anxiety throughout the home defence, could have been ahead from their first attack when \u00d6zil swept over from Monreal\u2019s inviting pull-back. The contrast between the teams\u2019 attacking styles was increasingly apparent before the visitors took the lead. Arsenal played with the composure and imagination of a settled, confident side while Everton again resorted to hit-and-hope long balls to an isolated Romelu Lukaku. They appeared bereft of any other ploy but needed one after falling behind in slapstick fashion. \u00d6zil opened the Everton defence with an exquisite ball down the left and that was the only touch of quality before the ball nestled in the back of the Gwladys Street net. Having dealt with the danger, Valencia overran the ball on the edge of his area. It fell to Barkley, who was sluggish and dispossessed by Francis Coquelin, then to Ashley Williams, who completely missed the ball and took out Idrissa Gueye instead, leaving Jagielka to collect his first booking with a foul on Coquelin on the edge of the area. S\u00e1nchez applied the coup de mess. His low free-kick deflected off Williams\u2019s calf to leave Stekelenburg floundering as he got a hand to the ball but could not prevent it sailing in. Arsenal were comfortable, Everton lacked the basics but with Koeman despairing at Stekelenburg\u2019s long clearances and the crowd restless, the contest was transformed by nothing more than a show of aggression and commitment from the home side. Lukaku drove over, Lennon sliced a decent chance wide and, with Everton on top, Coleman equalised moments before the break. The goal will have realised Arsenal\u2019s worries about losing Shkodran Mustafi from the heart of their defence through injury. Baines swept a dangerous cross into the area with his right foot where his fellow full-back rose unmarked between Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel to convert a glancing header. Coleman\u2019s celebration \u2013 cupping his ear to the crowd \u2013 perhaps revealed his annoyance with recent criticism and there was a minor melee on half-time involving McCarthy, \u00d6zil, Williams and Granit Xhaka. Koeman could not complain: anger suited Everton and Arsenal, after those early flashes, were relatively subdued in reply. Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain were anonymous and it was no surprise when Wenger withdrew both. Arsenal had their moments in the second half, \u00d6zil missing another cut-back from the left, but they were susceptible to Lukaku\u2019s strength on the counter-attack and the awareness of Barkley. Goodison implored its men forward in the dying stages. Williams answered the call."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
