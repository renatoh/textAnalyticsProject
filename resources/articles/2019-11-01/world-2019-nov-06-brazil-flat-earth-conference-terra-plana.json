By the end of 2015, he was convinced. \u201cThe model that is imposed on us \u2013 that the Earth is spherical \u2013 is full of contradictions,\u201d he said. Today, his YouTube channel Professor Terra Plana (Flat Earth Professor) \u2013 featuring videos such as \u201c25 examples that prove Nasa is a fraud\u201d and \u201cgravity doesn\u2019t exist\u201d \u2013 has nearly 29,000 subscribers. Like Britain and the United States, Brazil is seeing a revival of flat Earth theory: 7% of the population \u2013 11 million Brazilians \u2013 believe that the Earth is flat, according to the polling firm Datafolha. The poll noted believers were more likely to be religious or poorly educated. Last week, Chaibub and three of his flat Earth fellows got their biggest break yet when they appeared on the country\u2019s most-watched talkshow, The Night, to promote Brazil\u2019s first ever flat Earth convention this Saturday in S\u00e3o Paulo. The location of the event will only be disclosed on the day, organizers say, for security reasons. \u201cThere is a lot of prejudice,\u201d said Chaibub Critics attribute Brazil\u2019s most recent flat Earth craze to poor public education, copycatting from abroad and to the increase in social media use. \u201cThe internet gives a voice to these idiots,\u201d said Fernando Lang da Silveira, a professor of physics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. He said that like climate change denial and creationism, flat Earth theory had a base of Christian fundamentalism. In Brazil, the power and influence of the evangelical Christian church has grown significantly in recent decades: around a quarter of the population identifies as evangelical and these voters played a large part in bringing the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to power. Chaibub, who says he is a Catholic, admits that part of flat Earth culture is influenced by Bible verses, but denied that the movement is religious \u2013 or political. Accusations of links to the flat Earth movement have dogged Bolsonaro\u2019s government. In January, the science minister, Marcos Pontes \u2013 South America\u2019s first astronaut \u2013 said that he felt a \u201cknot in the stomach\u201d when he heard suggestions that the Earth is flat. But just a few months later, Olavo de Carvalho \u2013 a former astrologer who is considered the intellectual guru of Bolsonaro and his inner circle \u2013 prompted outrage and ridicule when he tweeted: \u201cI didn\u2019t study the subject of the flat Earth. I just watched a few videos of experiments that show that aquatic surfaces are flat \u2013 and so far I haven\u2019t found anything to refute them.\u201d Carvalho \u2013 who has also claimed Pepsi was sweetened with aborted foetuses and that oral sex can cause cancer \u2013 dined with Bolsonaro and Steve Bannon in Washington during the Brazilian president\u2019s state visit to the US in March. When questioned about flat Earthism, the foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo \u2013 an Olavo disciple who believes climate change is a Marxist plot \u2013 also seemed sympathetic to the movement, saying: \u201cFor me, the Earth is round. But it\u2019s important to have this spirit of questioning,\u201d Brazil abounds in folk legends, and has long been home to a thriving subculture of new-age truth-seekers and UFO-spotters. One of the country\u2019s most popular authors, Paulo Coelho, claims to have had \u201cexperiences\u201d with aliens \u201cmore than once\u201d \u2013 although he recently clarified to the BBC that he knew the Earth wasn\u2019t flat. Marcelo Gleiser, a Brazilian professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College in the United States and winner of this year\u2019s Templeton Prize, described the resurgence of the theory as \u201cvery sad\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re living in very strange times. The idea of being popular for being outrageous is coming from the leadership,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
