The club\u2019s chairman, Julian Tagg, has expressed concern over what message it will send to academy staff and lower league clubs developing homegrown players. Ampadu, who is 17, moved to Chelsea last summer and has played seven times Tagg said: \u201cAbove all we are disappointed for football as we feel this decision sends the wrong message in terms of financial reward for those who are producing talented homegrown players for both club and country.\u201d Ampadu made his Exeter debut aged 15 years 330 days in August 2016 and has two Wales caps. Meanwhile, Antonio Conte has claimed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s eye-catching record over his first century of games in charge of Chelsea reflects the money-flushed ambitions of Roman Abramovich\u2019s early years as owner, with the task the Italian took on at the club \u201cnot simple\u201d in comparison. Victory at Burnley on Thursday left Conte with 65 wins from his first 100 games in charge of at Chelsea, a record that is beaten at the club only by Mourinho with 72. While Although the current head coach admits his team\u2019s toils this season are a source of frustration and regret \u2013 his side go into Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton still clinging to the possibility of securing silverware a trophy this term \u2013 he was quick to put his predecessor\u2019s record into proper context. \u201cI could do better,\u201d said Conte of his own impressive tally of wins. \u201cThis is my mentality. For sure, this is a good stat but I know that, this season, we could have done better,\u201d Conte said. \u201cMourinho was 72 in the first 100? We are talking about a great manager, but don\u2019t forget that the first 100 games with Mourinho were many years ago. Now it\u2019s not simple, I think, to have those types of results in this moment, with this present Chelsea \u2026 it\u2019s a different era now and a different era in the history of the club. I have to consider this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
