PSG take a 2-0 advantage into Wednesday night\u2019s last-16 second leg at the Parc des Princes. However their German manager is wary of Solskj\u00e6r and cited the Norwegian\u2019s famous late winner as a substitute that beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in the final of 20 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s better to always be aware of the qualities of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cHe was one of the key players of the biggest era of this club. He was always ready to help, in 30 minutes, 20 mins, 10 or five. This is the spirit of Manchester United, that they are ready for anything. \u201cThey are a strong club with a strong history. It is totally normal that we respect his quality. It\u2019s a big challenge for us and we can bring the result from the first match and it is a big challenge for us.\u201d Asked how his side will approach the game, Tuchel said: \u201cWe need to forget the first result. Luck is also a factor, but we want to make sure there\u2019s no luck involved. It\u2019s important to reproduce what we did well, to find the right areas and forget the result, just concentrate on the actual performance. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play the same game, whether we won or drew the first match. I can\u2019t let the players be influenced by that result. You have to be 200% ready. The result will be what it will be, we just have to give our best.\u201d Solskajer said United require the first goal to have a chance to overturn the deficit. \u201cFor us too,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cThe first goal is really important, for us to show qualities and play together as a team. My team has been showing a very good level recently. Tomorrow the key is to be confident but not too confident, not be scared, trust in our skills and qualities as a team. We need to be ready in case Manchester score first. The game is going to be very tight, and we cannot waste our time thinking about every possible eventuality. We need to be ready to react to any type of scenario. The challenge is to play at our best.\u201d Tuchel may have Edinson Cavani back following a muscle injury. \u201cHe was with us in the last couple of training sessions. We\u2019ll decide tomorrow together whether he is going to be playing or not,\u201d he said. \u201cI know who\u2019s going to play but I can\u2019t say because we have training. The goalkeepers also know but you\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
