The board of the London mayor's Transport for London organisation, set up to run the city's transport system, is today expected to authorise a legal challenge to the government's part-privatisation plans after hearing a report on weeks of fruitless negotiations from the transport commissioner, Bob Kiley. Mr Kiley, who has blamed the situation on the chancellor, Gordon Brown, was yesterday given last-minute confirmation that a suggestion passed to him on Monday - offering extra powers to intervene in the private companies bidding for the tube - was in fact a firm government proposal. But a source close to Mr Kiley said that although it represented the first time the government had offered \"more than cosmetic changes\" to its plans, the proposal still did not provide the \"essential unified management control\" that Mr Kiley and Mr Livingstone have demanded. Early last month, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, asked Mr Kiley to \"modify\" the government's partial sell-off scheme with the aim of reaching a deal by the end of February. Negotiations were continuing last night, but allies of the London mayor accused the government of reneging on that agreement and complained that sensible negotiation had proved almost impossible, with the Treasury intervening to veto any package floated by other government officials. The Greater London Assembly yesterday voted to \"call upon the government to honour its commitment to Bob Kiley to provide unified management of the London underground,\" with Labour members abstaining. A transport department spokeswoman said that Mr Prescott had not regarded the end of February as a firm deadline. But without a change of heart, the argument looks increasingly likely to end up in the high court. Pressure on the government over the tube also intensified when the largest rail union announced a fresh ballot for strikes over jobs and safety under the part-privatisation scheme. The Rail Maritime and Transport union was banned by the high court on a technicality from joining the traindrivers' union Aslef in a one-day walkout last month. The result of the new ballot of its 7,500 tube members is expected in a week, with renewed stoppages possible from mid-March. The risk of court action and strikes in the run-up to a general election is alarming London Labour MPs. Leftwinger Diane Abbott said last night: \"Risking the loss of a string of London marginals seems a high price to pay for Gordon Brown's stubbornness\". Opposition parties were also keen to capitalise on the impasse, with the Conservatives confirming abandonment of their previous support for outright privatisation of the underground in favour of working with Mr Kiley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
