Not totally safe; even the president concedes that. But safer, and that's quite good enough for us ... Sure, domestic issues are important: the nation's economic health undergirds the war on terror. And folks naturally worry about their pocketbooks. Education is critical ... But in the end, no issue comes close in importance to the war ... \"[Mr Bush] has made enormous headway in eliminating threats from both global terror networks and hostile regimes, like that of Saddam Hussein ... The Bush doctrine of pre-emption and aggressive promotion of freedom abroad has put dictator-thugs and terrorists everywhere on notice.\" Washington Post Editorial, October 24 \"We believe John Kerry, with his promise of resoluteness tempered by wisdom and open-mindedness, has staked a stronger claim on the nation's trust to lead for the next four years ... \"[Mr Kerry] promises more fiscal realism. He sensibly proposes to reverse Mr Bush's tax cuts on the wealthiest and pledges to scale back his own spending proposals if funds don't suffice ... He has a workable plan to provide health insurance to more Americans; the 45 million uninsured represent a shameful abdication that appears not to have concerned Mr Bush one whit ... \"A Kerry judiciary - and the next president is likely to make a significant mark on the Supreme Court - would be more hospitable to civil rights, abortion rights and the right to privacy ... \"[Mr Kerry] pledges to both fight in Iraq and to reach out to allies; to hunt down terrorists, and to engage without arrogance the Islamic world.\" Miami Herald Editorial, October 17 \"Forced to confront a surprise attack on the homeland three years ago, Mr Bush rose to the challenge. He deserves credit for holding the nation together in a moment of great peril. But the president who came to office as a 'compassionate conservative' has often displayed a narrow partisanship. A bold doctrine of preemption replaced the promise of 'a more humble foreign policy'. A stubborn refusal to accept uncomfortable facts and a simplistic approach to complicated issues raise questions of basic governance skills. These grave concerns override mere differences on issues with his challenger ... \"On the basis of experience, a strong campaign and command of the issues that make this such a crucial election, the Herald recommends John Kerry.\" Houston Chronicle Editorial, October 24 \"Mr Bush's strongest qualities are his decisiveness and clarity. As Mr Bush proudly proclaims, for him or against him, everyone knows where he stands. Like many people, Mr Bush finds it difficult to admit a mistake, particularly when under attack on all sides. However, history is replete with instances in which imperfect but confident national leaders proved preferable to cautious, indecisive ones. \"In Mr Kerry's case, many of his supporters are dismayed by their candidate's seeming inability to speak his mind in a way that conveys and inspires confidence. Mr Kerry often crafts positions based on calculated expediency, and then has a hard time explaining the basis for them. \"The ticket of George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney has a proven if flawed track record. The nation is taking demonstrative steps to defend itself, and the economy and job market are improving.\" Newsday Editorial, New York, October 24 \"Mr Kerry has demonstrated streaks of decisiveness and has been willing to take unpopular stands. And he has a deep understanding of national security affairs and a determination to help this country rebuild its alliances in the world. That is critical for the war on terrorism ... \"Mr Bush's presidency has been too radical and too often wrong. Mr Kerry will have a fresh chance to bring the country together, to help heal the wounds of the past 12 years when partisan bickering has reached historic highs ... Mr Kerry is not an ideologue, and his desire for success makes him more likely to compromise and find common ground with his opposition. He is the one candidate who can begin to heal the deeply bitter divisions in the nation. Mr Bush cannot and will not do that.\" Walter Shapiro USA Today, October 22 \"Both candidates paper over the problems they will immediately face if elected. When Mr Kerry talks about his ambitious healthcare plan ... he never explains how he plans to steer it through a Congress that will probably remain in Republican hands. \"Mr Bush is equally mysterious about the details of his social security programme ... [which] would require wrenching transition costs that the nation can ill afford at a time of record red-ink budgets ... In this dire fiscal environment, it is hard to see how either candidate as president can cobble together much of a domestic spending agenda ... \"There is scant hope that either Mr Bush or Mr Kerry will address these potential pitfalls ... That is why, no matter who is elected ... Americans are apt to face a series of unpleasant surprises.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
