St John Simpson, a senior curator and archaeologist in the British Museum\u2019s Middle East department, said a recent report claiming that more than 98% of items on some European markets did not have proven legal provenance \u2013 and in some cases could be linked to terrorist organisations \u2013 was misleading. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong tendency to say that all objects without provenance are the produce of recent looting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some objects have been circulating for decades, if not longer. It\u2019s a case of assessing each item on its own merits.\u201d Simpson said that in his role as an adviser for UK law enforcement on items that have been seized on exit or entry into the country, there has yet to be a proven case of a recently looted item from Syria being discovered in Britain. He said: \u201cI think the really telling statistic is that over the last eight years of the Syrian civil war we have yet to prove any objects have come into Britain that demonstrably come from looting in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are investigating cases at the moment but that is a remarkable figure.\u201d In March, a UN-backed report stated Germany had become an international destination for trafficking illegal antiquities from the eastern Mediterranean, including Iraq and Syria, with almost half of the 6,000 examined items coming from the two countries. The study, released by the German federal cultural foundation, looked at antiquities on sale in Germany between 2015 and 2018, and found only 2.1% had proven legal provenance. Markus Hilgert, general secretary of the foundation, said the report\u2019s findings were shocking, especially in light of EU trade restrictions in place for both Iraq and Syria. \u201cIn view of the ongoing, extensive destruction and looting of archaeological cultural assets in Iraq and Syria, this is an alarming finding,\u201d Hilgert added. Simpson said in Syria there had been \u201cad-hoc and opportunistic looting\u201d but the picture painted by the German foundation\u2019s study was down to \u201crather simplistic\u201d reporting. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like see every one of those objects personally to be confident that they are from recent looting rather than older items or fakes.\u201d The curator said the situation in the UK is completely different from the 1990s, when large numbers of looted Iraqi items were sold. He called for \u201ccaution and curatorial intelligence\u201d to be used when deciding when and where items originated. \u201cSome of these objects floating around on the western market could actually come not from recent looting, they\u2019re probably coming from 1990s or 2003 looting,\u201d he added. The British Museum recently launched the Circulating Artefacts project, to \u201ccounteract looting and trafficking of cultural artefacts\u201d. It created a database of objects designed to help curb the trade in illicit objects from Sudan and Egypt. But it has also been criticised for items in its collection that were acquired by looting, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken in a \u201cpunitive expedition\u201d led by British troops in 1897. Senegalese academic Felwine Sarr co-authored a report that recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa. He criticised the British Museum for acting like \u201can ostrich with its head in the sand\u201d after not addressing calls for items acquired by colonial-era looting to be returned. In response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a \u201ctransparent focus on the provenance of objects\u201d, adding that the museum agreed with the report\u2019s call for the establishment of \u201cnew and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
