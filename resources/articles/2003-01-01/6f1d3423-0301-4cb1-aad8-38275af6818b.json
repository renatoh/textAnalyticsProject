Alarmed at the way that the teachers it trained and needs are being enticed over here to plug British teacher vacancies, New Zealand's education ministry has hired the same teaching agencies that helped to persuade Lynch and her compatriots to come here in the first place, to find ways of getting them back. One of the methods is a relocation grant of NZ$5,000, or nearly \u00a32,000. After training at Waitako university, Lynch, now 23, taught for a year in nearby Taranga. But the British teaching agencies' advertisements in the New Zealand press looked very appealing to her. With the NZ dollar at a low ebb, translating British teachers' pay into local currency made it sound very attractive, even though she knew the cost of living was higher here. \"The advertisements say 'earn up to' and then put the London rates, but I have only worked outside London,\" she says. She's not sorry she came, though. She misses her country's beaches, but being within striking distance of European cities makes up for that. But she finds British schools far more assessment-driven than those at home. \"I can't go in and have fun, maybe teach them a bit about New Zealand, because that's not going to help them with their exams.\" She was a full-time teacher at home, but here she has worked as a supply teacher. \"My behaviour management skills are much better now because children always play up the supply teacher. You know you've got five or 10 minutes to get them onside. You develop a huge range of techniques to deal with it.\" Arriving in the UK in August 2001 with her fianc\u00e9, a professional rugby player, Lynch first worked in Cardiff, where her fianc\u00e9 was with the rugby club, and, in May last year, moved to Worcester. Now she reckons the time is right to go home, and she might well have been going soon anyway - but the relocation grant made her decision easier. \"It pays the air fare with some to spare.\" No one knows exactly how many New Zealand teachers Britain has, but David Rose, of Select Education, one of the agencies that handles the trade in teachers for both countries, estimates that at any one time 2,000 New Zealand teachers are working in British state schools. It is not a huge proportion of the 400,000 or so teachers - there are many more Australians. For Britain, losing them will be more a loss of quality than of quantity. Tish Seabourne, who runs TimePlan, the oldest of the teacher agencies, expresses a widely held view. \"We ask for feedback from heads, and every year for the past 13 years, New Zealand teachers have come out on top. They are considered the best-trained teachers in the English-speaking world. They are also often willing to go the extra mile.\" Many New Zealand primary school teachers are trained in reading recovery, still the most effective way to cure severe reading problems in young children, which was created at Auckland university. Reading recovery is used all over New Zealand, but in Britain, though its benefits are generally accepted, its high cost ( it requires one-to-one teaching for half an hour a day over up to 20 weeks) has ensured that successive governments have paid it little more than lip service. So far as quantity is concerned, Seabourne is less worried. New Zealand provides 5% to 10% of the teachers on TimePlan's books. Another agency, Capita, reckons the country provides about a fifth of its overseas teachers, compared with 65% from Australia. It's unlikely that the supply of them will dry up. Young New Zealanders want to travel, and supply teaching in England is one way of making what they call their OE (overseas experience) possible. The relocation grant may simply speed the return of many teachers who would be going home eventually anyway. But London may be the one place that will struggle without them. As Nigel de Gruchy, of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers has put it, \"London teaching services have been kept afloat by thousands of young supply teachers coming from Australia, New Zealand, and, latterly, South Africa.\" Certain subjects may suffer, too, because New Zealand's shortages are in the same subjects as ours, particularly mathematics, science, and information technology. For New Zealand, getting its teachers back is a big issue, especially in Auckland, where a third of the population lives. Two thousand is a lot of teachers to take out of a country with a population of little more than 3 million and about 43,000 teachers. There are currently 323 teaching vacancies in New Zealand secondary schools alone, and the school population is growing fast. At the same time its teaching force is ageing: six out of 10 are over 40, and many of them retire every year. Irene Lynch, of the education ministry, says: \"We also have an increase in the number of migrant families coming here, and in the number of international students wishing to complete their secondary schooling in New Zealand, particularly from India and China.\" The latest settlement with the country's secondary teachers' trade union promised 373 additional teaching positions for 2003, in addition to the extra teachers required for the growth in the school population. All this will be hard to deliver when more than 300 of the country's 16,800 secondary teachers are going abroad, and 500 of its 27,000 primary teachers. The New Zealand government is particularly anxious to get some male teachers into primary schools - just as we are here - and it urgently needs its Maori teachers back. It is concerned, not just about those who teach in Britain, but those who find other jobs here. Middle-class bits of London are full of families who have hired a New Zealand-trained teacher as a nanny, for example. The government wants to make sure that when they go home, they go back into the classroom. It has asked Select Education alone to recruit at least 70 secondary school teachers by May. The job is not just to bribe them, but also to match them with available jobs. The country is so worried that it has not stopped at trying to lure back its own teachers. It wants ours, too. The money on offer to them is not quite so good, but still attractive - NZ$3,000, or a little over \u00a31,000. David Rose says that, in recent months, Select Education has had a record number of inquiries from UK teachers wanting to work in New Zealand. Often they have 10 years' experience or more, and travel may revive their flagging enthusiasm and keep them in the profession. There are good promotion opportunities for returning teachers, says Irene Lynch. \"The experience our teachers gain from their work in the UK is invaluable, not just to the individuals, but because of the wide variety of educational and cultural expe riences they can bring to our children.\" If they are aged 27 or under, New Zealand teachers often come here on a working holiday visa, and work as supply teachers, partly because that visa does not allow them to work more than 50% of the time. This is what Bronwyn Lynch did. Others have work permits, which can now last up to five years but are usually for two years. These teachers tend to be a little older, and to have permanent or long-term jobs. The UK, which wants to keep them, is again making things worse for New Zealand, which wants them back: \"The lifting of the two-year time limit in the UK means that these New Zealand trained-teachers may stay on longer in the UK than previous cohorts,\" says Irene Lynch. Those wanting to stay longer may be able to get ancestor visas, allowing them to stay for four years in the first instance and then to apply for indefinite permission to remain. For this they have to establish descent from a grandparent born in the UK. The relocation grant helps to explain why Bronwyn Lynch will be on the plane in February, dreaming of the beaches she has missed these past two years. But she has to make sure she works full-time for at least 20 weeks when she gets back. Otherwise her government may ask for some of its money back.
