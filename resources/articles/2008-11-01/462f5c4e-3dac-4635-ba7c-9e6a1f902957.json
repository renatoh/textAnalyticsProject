Luke Watson is the son of the anti-apartheid activist Daniel \"Cheeky\" Watson, who famously refused to don the green and gold Springbok shirt, one-time symbol of white minority rule in South Africa. Cheeky Watson says that \"sinister forces\" are behind the release of the remarks, and is seeking legal advice. Meanwhile, there were rumours followed by denials that several players would boycott the forthcoming Springbok tour of Europe if Luke Watson was in the squad, and that some of the team refuse to play with him. All this is nothing compared with the political storm which has been unleashed in this sports-mad country. Regardless of the truth, the question of whether Luke Watson is a hero or villain is dividing South Africans. People are now asking: is it just a shirt, or the hated symbol of a once racist system? Even the ruling ANC has weighed in on the debate. \"The Springbok divides us. We have a responsibility to unite our country on one national emblem,\" Parliamentary sports portfolio committee chairperson Butana Komphela told delegates at a two-day national sports indaba in Durban recently. He went on to say there could be \"no negotiation\" on getting rid of the Springbok. Komphela implored the minister to \"observe the arrogance of the white people on the Springbok emblem.\" The sports and recreation minister Makhenkesi Stofile disagreed. \"My view is that emblems are not a matter of life and death,\" he said. But then Gwede Mantashe, the ANC secretary-general, upped the ante, telling the press: \"The ANC supports a debate around the Springbok. The ANC's position is that the country must have a single national sporting symbol. Rugby cannot be an island.\" Sentletse Diakanyo, writing for the Mail &amp; Guardian, proclaims that the Springbok emblem must go, and that \"the eradication of relics of apartheid is unfairly seen as an affront on the heritage of certain sections of our society, which is determined to preserve all that is offensive to the majority of this country.\" But he adds somewhat paradoxically \"a lot has happened since then [apartheid].\" When South Africa won the rugby World Cup in 1995 and 2007, \"The Springboks were not representing whites only but all the rest of us, black and white.\" \"The Luke Watson 'outburst' is the clearest sign yet that there are many in our country who are still not willing to acknowledge the injustice that was apartheid.\" says blogger Jeff Mpondozenyathi, in the South African paper the Times. Others have commented that Luke Watson will be remembered as a South African hero. And it certainly looks as if he will end up being a martyr to the cause. He announced over the weekend that he would not be available for the European tour in November. In a nation where the names of airports, roads and even cities have been changed to erase the white supremacists from the psycho-geography, replacing them with the heroes of the liberation struggle, why shouldn't the famous emblem also go? Or is this a symbol too far? It has been suggested that like the South African cricketers, the rugby team should be called the Proteas, after the national flower. But as one blogger writing in the Mail &amp; Guardian says: \"How does a flower give one an image of an indomitable fighting spirit?\" Will changing the badge really teach anyone a lesson? The South African rugby team is known throughout the world as the Springboks. Maybe they could add a rainbow to the emblem to symbolise Bishop Tutu's rainbow nation, but it is hard to imagine them being called anything else. Many people will recall how Nelson Mandela, then president of Republic, wore his Springbok shirt and cap with pride at the 1995 World cup final, embracing and appropriating this once divisive symbol. If it is good enough for Mandela, it is good enough for me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
