Powell, a Guardian columnist during World Cup 2010 in South Africa, was appointed as the first full-time England women's head coach in 1998, leading them to the final of the European Championship last year in Finland, and in 2003 was the first female coach to achieve the Uefa Pro Licence. She was awarded an OBE in 2002. After being named in the honours list Powell said: \"For me personally, I'm honoured and proud to receive such a fantastic award. It's even better for the women's game to be honoured and this award is great recognition for all the hard work and efforts of the staff and players that I work with.\" The Football Association general secretary, Alex Horne, praised Powell's work in developing the women's game. \"We are extremely proud of Hope's achievements with the England team over the last decade,\" he said. \"She is a tremendous ambassador for women's football and has been instrumental in the growth of the game, which will culminate in the launch of the new Women's Super League in 2011.\" Powell also led England at the 2001 European Championship, the 2005 European Championship, the 2007 World Cup finals in China and, last summer, the European Championship in Finland. As a player she won 66 caps for England, mainly as an attacking midfielder, scoring 35 goals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
