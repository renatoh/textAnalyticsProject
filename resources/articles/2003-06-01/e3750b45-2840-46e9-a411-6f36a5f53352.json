After his battle against the elements the Scot, his geniality restored, called it \"one of the best 72s I've put together in a long, long time\". Montgomerie's score, his first competitive outing on the PGA Centenary course, where the 2014 Ryder Cup will be held, left him two shots off the lead in the Diageo Championship and level with a group that included last year's winner Adam Scott. The Australian should have finished well clear of Montgomerie but somehow took four putts on his final green. He rolled his first effort five feet past from 20 feet away, his next attempt scampered two feet past and he did not even touch the hole from there. Montgomerie and Scott are two strokes behind the low-profile trio of Brad Kennedy, a virtually unknown Australian, and two better-known but far from illustrious Scots, Alastair Forsyth and Marc Warren. Their 70s left the leaderboard headed for the first time this season by a score not in the 60s. After missing cuts at the Wales Open and the British Masters Montgomerie hit his target of playing all four rounds at last week's US Open, and yesterday was another step towards rehabilitation. It also helped in his long-term preparations for next month's Open at Royal St George's although, recalling his 84 at windy Muirfield in the Open's third round last year, he said he would not be praying for wind at Sandwich just because he played well in it here. \"I'd like it flat calm, thank you,\" he said. \u00b7 Kirsty Taylor continued her purple patch yesterday when she shot an opening 69 in the French Open to finish the day one shot off the lead, writes Elspeth Burnside in Arras. Over the past 10 days the Lancastrian has qualified for her first US Open, had a season's best tie for fourth in the Irish Open and celebrated her 32nd birthday. In uncomfortably cool and windy conditions Taylor had four birdies and her only bogey came via three careless putts at the par-five 5th. She finished one behind the leading group of three, which included Lynnette Brooky, the defending champion from New Zealand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
