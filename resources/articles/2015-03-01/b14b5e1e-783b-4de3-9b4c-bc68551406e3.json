Kompany was left on the bench at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday evening for the 2-0 win over the bottom-placed team, the central defender paying the price for his latest mistake at Anfield on Sunday, which led to Liverpool\u2019s opening goal in the champions\u2019 2-1 defeat. While the Belgian has struggled for consistent form all season it was the first time in his seven-year City career Kompany had not been chosen due to playing reasons. However Hart, who was left out last season following a 2-1 defeat at Chelsea in which his mistake allowed Fernando Torres\u2019s late winner, said: \u201cVinny appreciates, same as we all do, that sometimes the manager will change the squad. There is no one destined to play every single game \u2013 I have learned that lesson. Vinny\u2019s an unbelievable player, one of the best I have ever played with, and this was his night off. I\u2019m sure he will be back in the team again with that captain\u2019s armband, being one of the best defenders in world football.\u201d Speaking before helping City to what was only a ninth clean sheet of the league season, Hart accepted his side\u2019s faltering title defence has been down to poor defending. \u201cIt\u2019s not been good enough \u2013 we\u2019d all accept that \u2013 myself included,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a team we have to accept that it\u2019s not just the back four and the goalkeeper when we defend \u2013 we defend as a team. I don\u2019t set out to be brutally honest but I\u2019d struggle to say things any other way. I\u2019d always protect my team and protect my team-mates but it\u2019s pretty hard to not tell the truth when millions of people have just watched what happened.\u201d Hart is enjoying a fine personal campaign but is still keen to improve. \u201cI am still learning the game, still growing into it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been here a long time but I want to keep improving and that is not going to change as long as I put on a Man City jersey. I am just enjoying the run of games I am involved in at the moment, and the opportunities that keep coming my way, and hope that I can keep taking them.\u201d City, who trail Chelsea by five points and have played a game more, next play Burnley a week on Saturday as Pellegrini\u2019s side are not involved in the weekend\u2019s FA Cup action. \u201cI have come to love playing every three or four days,\u201d Hart said. \u201cQuite recently we had one game every week, and it just doesn\u2019t feel right, but we are out of the Cup and have to accept it. We have the days off and have to use them to recover and get ready for Burnley.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
