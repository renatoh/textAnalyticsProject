That was David Lepper \u2013 but he had not been defeated: he had announced long before the election that he planned to stand down (Our very own San Francisco, 19 May, page 6, G2). \u2022\u2008A photo caption with a feature on where to find vintage items in Paris \u2013 Le flea c'est chic, 22 May, page 68, Weekend \u2013 attributed the classic three-legged ant chair to Charles Eames (of the United States). The designer was Arne Jacobsen (of Denmark). \u2022\u2008Readers challenged a book extract that seemed to suggest that Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb. To clarify, the breakthrough that was made and publicly demonstrated about a year before Edison's \u2013 by Joseph Swan of Newcastle, in early 1879 \u2013 was acknowledged by the book, but this element had been cut for space (Let there be light, 17 May, page 6, G2). In extract two (First flush, 18 May, page 10, G2) readers challenged the description of garderobe as \"a word now extinct\", noting that it is alive and well in Dutch and French. To clarify, the intention was to say it was extinct in English usage as a word for privy. \u2022\u2008Not for the first time, we've misspelled \u2013 as Minelli \u2013 the film director Vincente Minnelli (Lost without translation, 20 May, page 32). \u2022 This column was amended on 26 May 2010. The original published the ant chair designer's surname as Jacobson, because an editing revision was omitted. This has been rectified.
