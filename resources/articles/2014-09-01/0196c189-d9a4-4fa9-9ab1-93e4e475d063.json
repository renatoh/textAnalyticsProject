Appearing on the ABC on Sunday morning, Lambie also repeated her call for people who believed in sharia to leave Australia, but struggled to explain what sharia was. Lambie said she knew who Kakar was when she shared the image on Facebook of Kakar in a burqa holding a gun, edited with the caption: \u201cTerror attack level: severe \u2013 an attack is highly likely. For security reasons it\u2019s now time to ban the burqa.\u201d Kakar was shot by the Taliban in 2008 outside her home in front of her young son after campaigning for women\u2019s rights and against extremism. The photographer, Lana Slezic, criticised Lambie saying she was desecrating the memory of Kakar. But in a statement released on Saturday night Lambie accused Slezic of \u201cviciously attacking\u201d her, saying her response was \u201can explosion of vitriol\u201d and Kakar would have been \u201cthe first to agree\u201d with Lambie\u2019s anti-burqa campaign. \u201cAs a police officer she would have known how easy it was to conceal weapons or bombs capable of killing large numbers of innocents under a burka,\u201d Lambie\u2019s statement said. \u201cShe would have known how much safer it would be in public if the burka was banned. This story is a disgusting, unprofessional beat up \u2013 which will embolden and put a smile on the faces of the sharia extremists.\u201d Lambie said her Facebook post honoured Kakar and her \u201cdeadly struggle against brutal thugs and extremists\u201d. \u201cThis policewoman fought for freedom against the sharia extremists \u2013 so I would have thought part of her fight, was for the right for Afghan women not to wear a burka,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there was a reason why this brave woman was shot, my guess is that it was because she chose to defy the sharia extremists and submit to their threats - and dressed without their burka.\u201d On Sunday Lambie called Kakar a \u201cbloody hero\u201d and said she did not regret sharing the image. Asked on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program if she thought the image was menacing, Lambie replied: \u201cAbsolutely not. What that woman was trying to do for other women and to be gunned down by the Taliban is extreme, but this is one hell of a heroic woman out there and people should know her story and be very aware of what she was doing every day for the women of her country.\u201d Lambie said the banning of the burqa was a national security issue and called for people who believe in sharia to \u201cget out\u201d of Australia. Lambie said of sharia: \u201cit obviously involves terrorism. It involves a power that is not a healthy power.\u201d Asked in what way it involved terrorism, Lambie replied: \u201cWell, I just think sharia law, you get it mixed up in, well, if you are not going to show, if you are going to be a supporter of sharia law and you are not going to support our constitution and allegiance to our constitution and Australian law, then, you know.\u201d Lambie said moderate Muslims could not pick and choose tenets of sharia to follow and they had a choice between it or the Australian constitution. \u201cIt is one or other. You can\u2019t have 50-50,\u201d she said. Lambie said she did not have a problem with Muslims, only with extremists and sharia. \u201cThere is an issue right now. I want to see their full allegiance, not 50%, to the Australian constitution and Australian law. It is one law for all. That is the Australian law full stop,\u201d she said. The Facebook post using Kakar\u2019s image was originally made by the far-right UK party Britain First, without the permission of Slezic, who has tried to contact both the party and Lambie to ask them to take down the image. The picture was taken in 2005 as Kakar prepared to head out on a mission to free a kidnapped teenager, throwing a burqa over her Afghan national police uniform at the last minute. \u201cThis is not what I wanted for this photograph,\u201d Slezic said. \u201cTo see an image of her and all she still represents used this way is such an insult to her and her family and all the women in Afghanistan. I don\u2019t even have the words to describe it. \u201cHere\u2019s a woman whose life was taken by terrorists, extremists in the most horrific way,\u201d Slezic said. \u201cShe died in front of her son, shot to death outside her home on her way to work. \u201cEverything she stood for, everything she fought for, for herself, her family, her daughters and future of her country, everything has been desecrated by how Jacqui Lambie and Britain First have used this photograph. \u201cI\u2019m outraged actually [that] they would steal a photograph without any sort of consent.\u201d Kakar spoke about the burqa as offering her \u201cprotection\u201d in a documentary before her death. \u201cI am not forced to wear the chaudari [burqa], my husband or the police force does not require it. I want to wear it because it gives me advantages,\u201d she said. \u201cI wear it to protect my family and myself.\u201d In her statement Lambie also criticised the ABC for quoting Slezic. \u201cAnyone reading the ABC story could be forgiven for thinking it was me who gunned down the Afghan policewoman,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder what background briefing this ABC reporter gave to this photographer?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
