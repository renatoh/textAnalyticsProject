Can he do the same for ITV?", "bodyText": "The shaggy, rather shambolic man who made stars of Ant and Dec and revived Basil Brush appears an unlikely choice to take on the key role at the top of Britain's biggest commercial television network. But Nigel Pickard - until last week unknown outside television circles - is now suddenly being hailed as the saviour of ITV. Officially, Pickard, currently controller of Children's BBC, has taken a vow of silence since his appointment as director of programmes at ITV. But through friends, TV executives and other sources close to Pickard, Media Guardian has begun to establish an initial indication of the Pickard vision. He is, to coin a phrase, a quiet man. This genial, bearded 50-year-old could not be more different from the fizzing former Channel 5 chief executive Dawn Airey, notoriously the first choice of ITV bosses. But while the arrival of Airey would have signalled a bloodbath, the Pickard regime will be more of a velvet revolution. Pickard is unconcerned that he was so obviously the second choice. But despite ITV's well-documented travails, it is still the premier commercial broadcaster in Britain, and the job of director of programmes one of the most prestigious. Keen to ensure that his would be a long-term appointment rather than a caretaker role, Pickard has accepted a three-year term at ITV which, if all goes to plan, will take him beyond the proposed merger of the network's two main shareholders. ITV bosses are realistic and have talked to Pickard of \"achieveable\" audience targets. With the green shoots of recovery evident in this autumn's schedule, there is a sense that ITV's ratings woes may be bottoming out. David Bergg, ITV's director of programme strategy, breaks his usual media silence to reveal that Pickard will inherit a four-point recovery plan spanning entertainment, drama, films and daytime. He says there will be more entertainment events such as the second series of Pop Idol and I'm a Celebrity. In drama, money has been thrown at potential returning series such as Life Begins, the new project from Cold Feet creator Mike Bullen; a \"British Sopranos\" called Fury; and a gently romantic series called William and Mary, starring Martin Clunes as an undertaker. Forthcoming films include Mission Impossible 2 and Sixth Sense. And in daytime, there is a 30% budget boost (in the context of an overall ITV budget increase of 8% to \u00a3836m). Bergg is confident that Pickard will take up these reins with ease: \"It's a big beast, but Nigel is big enough to control it,\" he says. Coverage of Pickard's appointment centred on doubts that a children's TV man could cut it with the big boys. But this betrays a misunderstanding of children's television, which is essentially a microcosm of the grown-up variety. From Grange Hill to Newsround via SM:TV and Stig of the Dump, Pickard has had experience of drama, comedy, entertainment and news. There are precious few others who could command the same broad understanding. At heart, Pickard remains a programme maker. He aims to be a creative leader, to work collaboratively with commissioners at the ITV network centre. He wants the ITV commissioning team to be acknowledged by the industry as an elite - so there is unlikely to be a mass clear-out. He is understood to hold Nick Elliott and Claudia Rosencrantz, ITV's astute controllers of drama and entertainment respectively, in particularly high regard. Both have overseen ITV's break-out hits of recent years: in drama - Footballers' Wives, Bad Girls and Fat Friends; in entertainment - Pop Idol, Popstars and I'm A Celebrity. But he regards the revival of daytime as crucial to the channel's overall share and is said to believe it needs a hard rethink. He is also expected to lean heavily on the expertise of Bergg and the marking chief Jim Hytner. Pickard is aware of his limits: blank areas include some crucial elements of ITV's public service remit - current affairs, news and religion. And he has no plans or ambitions to become a high profile inspirational industry spokesman or statesman, as David Liddiment increasingly became in his campaign against the BBC's use of its power. Crucially, Pickard is unencumbered by the baggage of ITV's past, both creatively and corporately. The travails over Michael Barrymore and Richard and Judy passed him by; and unlike so many ITV executives, he is neither a Granada nor a Carlton man, happily neutral in the byzantine labyrinth of ITV corporate politics. Now that the initial surprise has worn off, the realisation is beginning to dawn that an astute decision may have emerged from ITV's notoriously dysfunctional management structure. Elliott who would almost certainly have walked out if Dawn Airey had been appointed and would have undoubtedly clashed with another name in the frame, Peter Bazalgette, can barely hide his relief. \"I know Nigel looks like he has just got out of bed, but he has incredible chutzpah.\" Bazalgette agrees: \"I thought that it was a very imaginative appointment. The same old names were going round the houses and all that speculation got very tedious. Then they come up with someone who wasn't on that list.\" The joint managing directors at the ITV network centre, Mick Desmond and Clive Jones, turned to Pickard three weeks ago, in the aftermath of Airey's decision. The only other name in the minds of Jones and Desmond was the head of programmes at Granada's northern division in Manchester, John Whiston, but he had already ruled himself out of the running. Jones had worked with Pickard (and Greg Dyke) at TVS, the former franchise-holder for the south of England, and the pair have remained friends. Pickard's CV is impressive: he has spent almost his entire career in the commercial sector, at TVS, Scottish Media Group and Flextech, where he gained crucial experience of the multi-channel sector. Latterly, he was the controller of children's TV at the ITV network centre, from where he was plucked by Dyke two years ago. He has launched two new channels at the BBC - CBeebies is now the UK's most popular children's channel, and the less successful CBBC. Pickard was wooed over a series of meetings, and when Jones and Desmond were sure of their man, they sent him to be interviewed by the Granada and Carlton chairmen Charles Allen and Michael Green. The deal was signed last Tuesday. Liddiment leaves at Christmas; while Pickard is on six months' notice at the BBC, bosses at ITV hope he will be in place by February to avoid a damaging hiatus. With the merger of Carlton and Granada finally under way and the disaster of ITV Digital in the past, there is a desperate need to ensure creative leadership. Pickard is said to be an inspirational leader - at Children's BBC, he managed some 500 people, commissioned 1,500 hours of television, and handled a budget this year of \u00a3125m. Thames TV's Alan Boyd, another TVS veteran, says: \"At the BBC, he has had to learn the politics of being political in a large organisation, which will be good for him with the Granada and Carlton thing. But at heart, he's a creative. This isn't an MBA bright young thing, this is someone who has worked his way up.\" Happily for ITV, PR chiefs were able to double up the announcement of a new director of programmes with confirmation of merger terms. Overnight, ITV turned into a good news story. As Bazalgette says: \"They've pulled a rabbit out of a hat.\" The Pickard file by Owen Gibson 1972: Starts at Southern TV, going from film editor to assistant director. 1982: Joins TVS, moving up to be controller of children's and family. 1992: Goes to Scottish TV as controller of entertainment and drama features. 1993: Director of programmes at the Family Channel, then general manager. 1998: After a year at Flextech Television, returns to ITV as controller of children's and youth programmes.

February 2002: Carpets Behr for interview in which she boasts of sex in a car park. Show's ratings fail to match SM:TV even after Ant and Dec go. September 2002: Axes Dani Behr. October 2002: Quits BBC for ITV. So what should he do now? by Matt Wells Nick Elliott controller of drama, ITV For me, the priority is daytime. They have said they are going to put more money into it, but I would put even more. The thing that fuels the story of ITV on the slide is the all-time share. Our peak-time share is still ahead, and quite comfortably so, but daytime is dragging down our all-time share so it's below BBC1. David Liddiment [Pickard's predecessor] will hate me for saying this, but we also need to return to a fixed pattern of scheduling. People should be able to tell the time of day by what is on the telly. And I don't see any point in having two news bulletins directly against each other. Peter Bazalgette chairman, Endemol UK How do you wrest back the initiative after EastEnders every night? Do you move the news to 10.30pm? If they were able to run 90-minute dramas at 9pm against BBC1 new they would do rather well I think. ITV News looks a bit starved. They say they want to raise the ITV1 budget to \u00a3900m in two years, and to me there is a direct correlation between money and ratings. I woud like to see some of that money go back to ITN, because News at Ten just looks a bit thin. Alan Boyd president of worldwide entertainment, Fremantle Build some bankers into the schedule: As Michael Grade said, scheduling is easy if you have got 20 slots and 20 great programmes. But if you have 20 slots and only three great programmes, it is more difficult. But he is instinctive and shrewd. His experience in children's television means he understands young people - that they have no patience, and you have to trap them into a programme. This is a very grown-up, instinctive, workaholic. He is very similar to David Liddiment in that he is a perfectionist at heart. He is a broader animal than first impressions would suggest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
