Fares will start from \u00a349 each way for the service which will be operated by charter airline Air 2000. In line with low-cost carriers such as Go and Easyjet, there will be no complimentary meals but passengers will be able to buy sandwiches and drinks on board. Unijet charter product manager Jeremy Preston said the pared down service had enabled the airline to shave at least \u00a310 off most return flights. Flights will operate on a weekly basis until 27 April. If the service is successful it will be extended to other popular Mediterranean destinations. Preston said the company was also looking into the possibility of offering more flexible durations which would attract people wanting a short break. Most charter tickets are sold for a mini mum weekly duration, but for destinations such as Malaga which have daily flights in the summer, three or four day breaks could soon be an option. Thomson-owned Britannia has a number of seats allocated on certain short-haul flights for passengers booking through its no-frills subsidiaries Britannia Direct and Just. Meals have to be prebooked as an optional extra on Britannia Direct services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
