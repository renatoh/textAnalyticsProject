The existence of the emails was first reported by the investigative website the Insider. According to the Insider, the emails suggest that an aide to the former footballer Franz Beckenbauer promised to deliver his vote in exchange for \u201cgenerous compensation for his consulting services\u201d, later specified as at least \u20ac3m. A Cypriot Fifa executive\u2019s vote could be bought for \u20ac1.5m, and the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner would vote for \u201cwhoever offers him the most\u201d, the Insider report says. The dossier also reportedly contains extensive background information about the council members, and even includes psychological profiles. It reportedly said the British football executive Geoff Thompson could be swayed through \u201cdiplomatic channels [and] expensive gifts to his wife, who has a strong influence on him\u201d. There is no suggestion that the Russian officials acted on the dossier, nor of any wrongdoing by those named. Thompson, who was at the time the head of England\u2019s rival World Cup bid, has denied his wife was offered any gifts. Warner has been banned for life by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee, and Sepp Blatter and the former France captain Michel Platini, who are both profiled in the dossier, each received an eight-year ban from football in 2011. The emails purportedly come from the account of Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country\u2019s national football academy, and are in the possession of an anonymously run Telegram channel called BlackMirror. In an email exchange, BlackMirror told the Guardian that it released the \u201csamples\u201d in order to stimulate interest from potential \u201cacquirers\u201d. The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa\u2019s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot. According to the Insider, it was sent to Igor Shuvalov, then a deputy prime minister under Vladimir Putin, Arkady Dvorkovich, an aide to the then-president Dmitry Medvedev, and Kapkov, who later became the head of Moscow\u2019s culture department. Fifa opened an investigation in 2014, but ultimately decided there was not enough evidence of bribery to re-run the vote. Fifa\u2019s head judge in the inquest noted that it had limited access to potential evidence and that the computers used by the Russian bid team had been destroyed after the vote. The emails were purportedly stolen from Kapkov, who left the government in 2015. Screenshots of the emails were released on the BlackMirror Telegram channel. Reached by the Guardian, the person or people behind the account avoided saying directly that they were selling the emails for money, writing instead that they would discuss \u201cconditions\u201d to \u201ctransfer\u201d the archive with \u201cpotential acquirers.\u201d BlackMirror said it didn\u2019t have any personal reaction to the information revealed in the emails. BlackMirror did not immediately say what price it wanted for the emails, but prices for similar archives can cost tens of thousands of pounds. In 2016, the hacking group Anonymous International reportedly requested 100 bitcoin, then about \u00a343,000, for emails purportedly from Kapkov\u2019s account. It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov\u2019s account. Asked how it had come into possession of the emails, BlackMirror said: \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss technical questions.\u201d BlackMirror said it was already considering another \u201crelease\u201d of files, likely not related to Russia\u2019s World Cup bid. The Insider said it had received originals from BlackMirror of the files allegedly shared between Kapkov and powerful Russian officials. Besides the dossier, they include strategy documents for a wide-reaching influence campaign among the 2018 World Cup organising committee and even large sponsors of the sporting organisation. Alexei Sorokin, the head of Russia\u2019s 2018 bid team, told the RBC news outlet that the documents were fake and that there was never any dossier of Fifa executive committee members. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said, adding that Kapkov took no part in the bid process. \u201cIt seems to me that the whole thing was fabricated from beginning to end.\u201d He also noted that Russia had answered questions during an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d into the vote and said that \u201call of our \u2018influence\u2019 came during open contacts\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
