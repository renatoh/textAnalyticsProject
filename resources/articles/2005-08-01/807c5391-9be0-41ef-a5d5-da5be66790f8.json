Lee Scott, the president and chief executive of Asda owner Wal-Mart, believes the government should investigate the dominance of Tesco, which last week was shown to have increased its share of the food market to a record 30.5%. Asda is in second place, with a 16.7% share. \"As you get over 30% and higher I am sure there is a point where government is compelled to intervene, particularly in the UK, where you have the planning laws that make it difficult to compete,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"At some point the government has to look at it.\" Asda has been particularly badly hit by the success of Tesco. Last week's survey by market researcher Taylor Nelson Sofres showed Tesco's share of the grocery sector stood at 30.5% over the 12 weeks to August 14, up from 28.1% last year, while Asda's had slipped to 16.7% from 26.6% during the previous year. Tesco reckons the 30.5% figure is \"misleading\" because it does not take account of other retailers in the sector, such as Marks &amp; Spencer Asda was this month ordered to stop saying that it is the cheapest supermarket in its advertisements. Tesco had complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that Asda's ads saying it was \"officially Britain's lowest-priced supermarket\" were misleading. The regulator agreed. Asda came top in a survey by trade magazine the Grocer, which said it was the cheapest for the seventh year running. But the ASA said this research was based on only 33 product lines and was therefore \"too limited\" to judge which was the cheapest. Last week Goldman Sachs said Tesco was cheaper than Asda for the first time since the investment bank began its pricing survey in December 2001. To regain the upper hand, Asda yesterday reduced prices on a range of goods in its stores from personal hygiene products to bread, coffee and wine as part of its 40th anniversary celebrations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
