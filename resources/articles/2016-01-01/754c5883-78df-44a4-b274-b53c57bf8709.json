This foregone conclusion was announced as part of a bunch of measures Goldsmith and David Cameron say will produce 10,000 new \u201caffordable\u201d dwellings on top of 50,000 the prime minister claims other policies will generate in London. Under a joint byline in the Evening Standard the pair were explicit about their motive: \u201cOur mission for 2016 is to help Londoners of all incomes find a foothold on the housing ladder.\u201d They described their approach as \u201cradical\u201d. Might it also be \u201cdivisive\u201d? Does it have anything going for it at all? Objections to the Bill have been widely aired, including in evidence submitted by Hackney\u2019s cabinet member for housing Philip Glanville. He foresees the loss of \u201cnearly 700 \u2018higher value\u2019 council homes\u201d from his east London borough in the first five years of the policy (see section three), causing increased temporary accommodation costs for homeless people, more deprivation, disruption of Hackney\u2019s substantial building programme and \u201cthe potential to wreck the mixed communities in Hackney, which the Council has worked so hard to support and on which Hackney and the capital\u2019s economic success depends.\u201d Glanville expresses concerns typical of many Inner London Labour politicians and probably some Conservatives too. They, after all, will have to grin and bear Cameron helping himself to most of the takings from making them sell off their areas\u2019 public housing assets in order to fund extending the right to buy to housing association tenants and various other promises immersed in his opaque, speculative legislative prefab. How might the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d deal play out across Greater London and its 32 boroughs as a whole? I hear that Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan\u2019s camp thinks the whole thing innumerate - more of that to come from them, maybe. But let\u2019s accept for now that it will at least result in more of the money raised from forced London council house sales being spent in London than would otherwise have been the case and more \u201caffordable\u201d housing altogether. The burning questions then become what sort of new \u201caffordable\u201d housing will it buy and where? The \u201cZac amendment\u201d, having been accepted by the government, is now listed under the name of communities secretary Greg Clark (amendment 112 on page 4) to be attached to clause 72 of the Bill (see page 31). It doesn\u2019t provide a \u201c2 for 1\u201d government \u201cbinding guarantee\u201d (to use Goldsmith\u2019s earlier term) but instead places an obligation on boroughs to ensure that \u201cat least two new affordable homes are provided for each old dwelling [sold]\u201d as part of an agreement allowing them to keep more of the proceeds of the sale of their council homes to help them meet the cost. The number of replacements they are required to help supply might be reduced if the Greater London Authority (GLA) under command of the mayor is contributing some as well. Now to those two big question marks. What sorts of \u201caffordable\u201d home might the required two replacements be? An answer is contained in section 7 of the \u201cZac amendment\u201d, which relates to the rest of England too. It says that the term \u201cnew affordable home\u201d means \u201ca new dwelling that (a) is to be made available for people whose housing needs are not adequately served by the commercial housing market or (b) is a starter home.\u201d The essence of this lies in its imprecision. There is no specification for councils to arrange for the replacement of the social rented homes they will be ordered to sell with new social rented homes from any source. Rather, the type of homes covered by section 7(a) encompasses the full spectrum of \u201caffordable\u201d housing as we have come to know it, taking in shared ownership products aimed at low to middle-income households. Section 7(b) augments this with the new starter homes for first-time buyers, which Cameron is to include within the formal definition of \u201caffordable\u201d. Starter homes are to be priced at a 20% discount from market rates, capped at \u00a3450,000 in London. As for where the various replacement \u201cnew affordable\u201d homes will go, there is no mention of any geographical unit other than Greater London. So where does the logic of the \u201cZac amendment\u201d lead? The boroughs and the GLA have been in discussions with each other and the government about how one of the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d replacements could be a rented property, be it at social or the higher \u201caffordable rent\u201d level, for people on the lowest London incomes. I\u2019m told there might still be some work to do on that. Boroughs might club together to pool and maximise resources and they will decide where the two replacements will go. But their choices will be limited by finance and circumstance. As far as I can tell, no one holds out any hope that all the replacements can be put in the same boroughs where council stock is sold. Building in expensive areas is, well, more expensive, not helped by the greater scarcity of land: it looks like ultra \u201chigh value\u201d Kensington and Chelsea will sell the most homes and they are also short of development sites. This means pressure for the replacement homes to be built in the cheaper parts of London, probably largely following and extending the present eastward pattern of new supply. It also means different boroughs reaching agreements among themselves about where the new stuff is to go. It\u2019s thought that Havering, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Bexley and, looking north, Haringey might not mind a bit more shared ownership - and the sorts of people who purchase it - but could, in some cases, be more wary about additional social housing, especially if the Inner London borough responsible for its delivery wants to nominate who lives in it. The mayoral politics of this could be lively. Expect Khan to be highly critical of the Bill while promoting his own range of lower-cost housing policies - including alternative routes into home ownership - and echoing the fears of people like Philip Glanville: the threat of huge losses of social housing from parts of London where the need for it is great could provide him with a strong message. But Goldsmith clearly means to sell his amendment as a True Blue beacon of hope for despairing would-be first time buyers. There will be an audience for that as well. If you, like someone I know and love, spend hours glued to websites offering shared ownership flats and take your laptop with you to the bathroom in case a chance to merely view a potential purchase along with droves of other hopefuls comes and goes during the few minutes you\u2019ve turned your back, you won\u2019t need reminding that the desire to buy even a 25% slice of a half-decent apartment in East Ham can run very deep. As both leading mayoral candidates know, the harder it becomes for such Londoners to get a toenail hold on that rungway to personal finance uplift known as \u201cthe property ladder\u201d the more intense can be their longing for it. And who can blame them? Periodically, some commentariat grandee decries an unhealthy British obsession with home ownership, but none ever proclaim that they are selling their handsome town house in Islington and entering the more beneficial world of the private rented sector instead. There might be a reason for that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
