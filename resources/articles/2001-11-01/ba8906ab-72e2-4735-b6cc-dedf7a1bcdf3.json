No problem: despite the depiction of college life in Tom Sharpe's Porterhouse Blue, there really are very few well-feasted skeletons in the highly-polished walnut-inlay collegiate cupboard (or indeed in the well-stocked wine-cellar). Oxbridge's charitable assets are deployed very clearly in support of the charitable objectives (teaching and research, and having to do so within an expensive-to-maintain listed building \"national heritage\" infrastructure). Some background. The financial accounts of the Oxbridge colleges are in the public domain, as required by the Charities Act 1993 (my college now shares with its student community the management accounts used for decision-making). The same applies to every other UK university and college, which are also all exempt charities (as are, say, the major national museums and galleries and assorted quangos). Being exempt means being accountable in other ways for the proper stewardship of charitable assets, rather than directly via the Charity Commission as for registered charities. Oxford and Cambridge each has \u00a32bn of endowment, mostly held by the colleges. This capital, and the level of income it can prudently generate (say, 4% per annum as the spend-rate), is crucial to underpinning both institutions as world-class universities and enabling them to compete (so far surprisingly well) with the US players, each of which has very much more endowment held on a similar basis under US charity law (Harvard, \u00a313bn; Yale \u00a37bn; Princeton, \u00a36bn - and half the size of Oxford - Stanford, \u00a36bn). Now the government could decide that the Oxbridge colleges fail the test of whether this charitable capital/income is being used for sufficient \"public benefit\". If we fail and hence lose charitable status, then clearly so do almost all \"public\" schools - unless they deploy their tax-exempt income wholly to fund bursaries to the extent of 100% fee relief - not just a bit off the fees for parents on \"only\" \u00a335,000 per annum. And where does all this leave state schools and their PTAs? Charitable status for the PTA of North Manchester high school for boys - my old school - serving a deprived inner-city area, but not for those PTAs at The Oratory or at Holland Park Comprehensive? Casualties would also presumably include the other \"elite\" UK universities where the student intake is just as resolutely middle-class (Bristol, Edinburgh, Durham, UCL), and even \"nicely located\" universities like Oxford Brookes or Bournemouth. Only those universities with, say, 60%, plus working-class students, could be said to be properly serving the public interest (eg North London, East London, Paisley) if, after the review, \"charity\" means helping the poor get educated and not merely providing education to rich and poor alike. Chancellor Gordon Brown would gain, in the short-term: the Inland Revenue would collect tax at 25% on the 4% income from the Oxbridge \u00a34bn (say, \u00a340m per annum to help pay for UK schools or hospitals), plus an amount for capital gains and from other UK universities: perhaps \u00a3100 to 150m per annum in all? Sadly, Mr Brown would also, in the long-term, lose out: Oxford and Cambridge would be unable to compete with the US ivy league, and even the likes of Warwick (which has no endowment assets worth mentioning) would lose financial flexibility if required to pay tax on conference trade earnings and short course activities deemed by the Inland Revenue to be \"profitable\". There would be no more tax relief on donations and legacies to UK higher education. If the flagship UK universities sink beneath the waves of global competition even faster than they are already destined to, the UK HE system will not attract the massive number of overseas students it currently does. The Treasury will not benefit from all that foreign exchange and spending power (nor, if UK HE declines that bit more, from whatever it is that well-taught graduates and university research add to the economy). The overseas market will go to California and Australia, where, anyway, it is sunnier and where HE charitable status will not have been reviewed and removed. All this assumes a cash-nexus decision, but perhaps a wider government view will be taken and (at last) some acknowledgement given that \"UK HE plc\" is a world-leader by OECD norms, with kulture and kudos counting as much (for once) as kash. The colleges themselves, however, do indeed need to be transparent in their accounting and well able to defend their expenditure as the proper use of charity assets. Certainly, nobody could accuse them of abusing charity income by overpaying their academics, who earn about half what they could at a decent US university. That said, your article is hopelessly wrong in comparing \u00a3120,000 on \"corporate hospitality\" at a Cambridge college with \u00a360,000 on \"supervisions\" (teaching). The overall academic bill is likely to be \u00a32m or more (and certainly not \u00a360,000 as just one minor component of it). At New College corporate hospitality as a percentage of the total spent is all of 1\u00cb4%. And, of course, Oxford and Cambridge (and other \"elites\") also need, quite properly, to be fire-proof on the question of access: my college gives a bursary of \u00a3750 per annum - from charitable income - to any undergraduate whose tuition fees are paid in full by the LEA after its means-testing process. The Cabinet office charities review task force is welcome any time in my bursary, but please tell them to bring butties, since to avail themselves of lunch as corporate hospitality could be an abuse of charitable status, unless Cabinet office folk are both in need of education and poor.
