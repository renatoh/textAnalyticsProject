In front of a celebratory crowd of 15,000, overwhelmingly local but including a few dozen Leeds fans, Paul Heckingbottom refused to be drawn on the political row the tour has caused. \u201cWe got what we wanted out of it. We wanted a good game that was more about the occasion. We wanted to represent the club in the correct way, and to make sure that the people here represented the club well,\u201d the Leeds manager said. Leeds lost the game 2-1, but the wider ramifications are harder to quantify. The club attracted significant criticism since it announced the two-match tour to Myanmar, as the country\u2019s government and its military comes under widespread international criticism for its treatment of the Rohingya minority. An estimated 700,000 have crossed the border into Bangladesh since August, fleeing a military crackdown that the United Nations has called \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. After the tour was announced Labour\u2019s shadow sports minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, said the club was \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d for choosing to visit a country that conducts \u201cstate-sponsored mass murder\u201d. The Leeds United Supporters Trust called it a \u201cstrange and controversial\u201d tour. Responding to the criticism the Leeds chairman, Andrea Radrizzani, published a statement acknowledging the \u201cserious issues within the country\u201d but said the tour represented a chance to have a positive impact on the local community. Fans from Myanmar attending the game on Wednesday expressed excitement about it and said it was a historic moment for the development of football in the country. \u201cWe really appreciate Leeds coming here\u201d said Pyay Sone in a rooftop bar overlooking the 32,000-capacity Thuwunna Stadium before the match. \u201cWe know they faced some criticism, but we are really happy that a team like Leeds would come here. This country is about more than what is happening [in Rakhine State]. We don\u2019t want to be seen like this. We are a football-crazy country. We are happy to have this team here.\u201d A similar sentiment was expressed by many of the Leeds fans attending the game after their 5,600-mile journey. \u201cWe had heard the criticism, so we did our research and looked at the pros and cons,\u201d said Nick Dunwell, who travelled with 20 other supporters. \u201cWe heard the stories, but since we have been here we\u2019ve had no problems \u2013 except for the heat.\u201d It was 33C in Yangon when the game kicked off and the Leeds players, who arrived the day after their final game of the Championship season, against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, also appeared to struggle with the weather. The Leeds contingent were vociferous, but attempts to get a rendition of the club song, Marching on Together, going were drowned out by the home crowd. At the interval the Leeds fans\u2019 biggest concern seemed to be getting hold of some beers at a stadium with an alcohol ban. The MNL side\u2019s starting team included five Myanmar players and the rest came from Japan, Cameroon and Nigeria, among others. They took the lead on 22 minutes when Hanthawaddy United\u2019s Ugandan midfielder Joseph Mpande bundled home a header. Four minutes later the Leeds striker Samuel S\u00e1iz, captain for the night, converted a penalty, but Christopher Chizoba followed suit with the winner from the spot. Leeds will now face the Myanmar national team on Friday night in Mandalay. \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about the result,\u201d said Roy Schofield, who had travelled from Yorkshire. \u201cWe\u2019re just here for the experience.\u201d The locals were also upbeat. \u201cThe Leeds players looked tired with the heat, but I\u2019m pleased they came here,\u201d said a fan, Maung Maung."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
