The unbeaten French colt has carried all before him in six career starts so far and though he may not have been tested against the best, the racetimes he has recorded and the manner of his victories suggest he could prove out of the top drawer. Some observers have crabbed the style of his latest success when he beat today's rival, Cacique, by just half a length in the Grand Prix de Paris. However, the muddling pace probably did not suit the winner that day and he is best judged on his smooth three-length beating of the same horse in the Prix Jean Prat. Sulamani will appreciate any cut in the ground, but this is shorter than ideal for him, while in contrast Azamour may find conditions stretching his stamina at this new trip. But the softish ground will hold no worries for Bago (3.00), who romped home on much more testing conditions last year at Saint-Cloud. The Great Voltigeur Stakes features another clash between the Derby second and third, Rule Of Law and Let The Lion Roar. They met again in the Irish Derby when fourth-placed Rule Of Law finished a place ahead of his rival. The Godolphin horse can come out on top again this time, but both may have to give best to Go For Gold (2.25) from the Aidan O'Brien yard which had no less than nine in this race at the five-day stage and relies on a colt who looks just the sort to go on improving. Millenary (1.50), reportedly in good order despite his three-month absence, has a turn of foot rare in a stayer and should be able to exploit that advantage provided the ground does not get too testing. First Charter is feared, but is best on top of the ground. The Godolphin camp are in no doubt that Oude (3.35) is a class act, while in the other race for juveniles the advice is to rely on Lubeck (4.10). He won his Newmarket maiden in eye-catching style and his big-race entries suggest he could prove better than his current handicap mark. The bookmakers go 10-1 in the opener, which tells you everything you need to know. Etmaam (1.20) is the tentative suggestion and the other all-aged handicap at the end of the day provides a more tempting wager in the shape of the Stewards' Cup runner-up Fantasy Believer (4.45)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
