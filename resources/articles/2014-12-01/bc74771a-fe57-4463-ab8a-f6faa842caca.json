There could have been more cards had the officials spotted Mikel John Obi\u2019s stamp on Sone Aluko in the buildup to Eden Hazard\u2019s headed goal. Hull\u2019s Alex Bruce smashed through Willian but was only booked, the same punishment dished out to Diego Costa for diving soon afterwards, despite having clearly been caught by Huddlestone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
