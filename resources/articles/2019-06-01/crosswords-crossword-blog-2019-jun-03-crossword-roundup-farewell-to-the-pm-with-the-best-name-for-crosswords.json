Latter patter Goodbye, then, to the prime minister most useful to crossword solvers. Most PMs are hopeless, having names that mean nothing but names. Sure, you might be able to get some ambiguity out of Major or Brown \u2013 at a pinch, Canning or Thatcher \u2013 but these have nothing on a name that is also a modal auxiliary. What about her nicknames? In 2017, Quentin Letts tried out Glumbucket, a variant of a term once applied to Lloyd George. It didn\u2019t stick. Nor did Teflon Theresa, from the period when various Home Office horrors were failing to do damage to May while she was home secretary; the Economist\u2019s Theresa Maybe (a bit obvious, lads) and Theresa the Appeaser (though surely not because of an excess of politesse in politics). Strenuously ignoring \u2013 for how can we not? \u2013 her MPs\u2019 sobriquet of Mummy, the one that did stick is the one clued with peculiar tact by Paul in a prize puzzle for which the annotated solution is now available: 22ac Political machine cruelly rejecting part of manifesto by a majority (6) [ wordplay: hidden (\u201cpart of\u201d) backwards (\u201crejecting\u201d) in MANIFESTOBYAMAJORITY ] [ definition: political machine cruelly ] The term MAYBOT was coined in these very pages: Guardian parliamentary sketch writer John Crace dropped it into a piece in November 2016. In the Q&amp;A below from last year, he explains how MAYBOT didn\u2019t catch on at first, because the rightwing press was in 2016 portraying May as strong and, it can\u2019t be denied, stable (at 17m41s): Not long after the \u201cstrong and stable\u201d election campaign, though, the nickname took hold, spreading to other papers, This Week and beyond. Incidentally, if youare feeling brave, skip to 28min 40sec, where even the unromantic Crace gives May until \u201cthe middle of 2019, by which stage we will have \u2026 some kind of transitional deal\u201d. Our next challenge concerns another prime-ministerial moniker. We are looking, not at the greatest of all nicknames (The Turf Macaroni, because of Grafton\u2019s love of hanging around at horse races), but at one given to Asquith for a habit celebrated in a music-hall song \u2026 Mr Asquith says in a manner sweet and calm: Another little drink won\u2019t do us any harm \u2026 reader: how would you clue SQUIFFY?
