The defence secretary, Des Browne, will today announce an additional \u00a324m investment for Headley Court rehabilitation centre in Surrey, which caters for all three armed services. The Ministry of Defence has come under pressure from campaigners and service families to expand provisions at the unit, which specialises in caring for amputees and personnel with brain injuries. But an internal review of the rehabilitation services concluded that current provisions were \"spot on\", according to an MoD source. \"The review of medical rehabilitation concluded: yes, we're doing a good job on that. Headley Court is doing a decent job, but needs more money for refurbishments.\" The clinic is a world-renowned facility offering a programme of intensive rehabilitation to prepare patients with the most serious injuries for a return to duty or civilian life. The money will largely be used to refurbish existing bedrooms, and to \"consolidate\" temporary and permanent wards. A workshop for patients with prosthetic limbs will also be expanded under the plans. However, there is no guarantee that the facility will cater for more injured troops than are currently being treated, the source said. MoD officials have welcomed charitable campaigns to raise money for Headley Court, but claim the unit's costs are already being met. The fundraising campaigns have received widespread support from footballers, TV celebrities, newspapers, the chief of the general staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt, and Princes Harry and William. The princes visited Headley Court last month and met several injured servicemen who had lost limbs in action. Tomorrow they will host a military pageant at St Paul's Cathedral, which will also raise funds for Headley Court. Campaigners are understood to have so far raised \u00a35m. The campaigns have coincided with growing disquiet over the treatment and compensation payments for military men and women suffering serious injuries in the field. Critics argue that a surge in casualties has put the military's provisions for injured personnel under strain. Between January 2006 and March 2008 more than 2,000 military personnel were evacuated out of Afghanistan and Iraq because of their injuries, although many of those with less serious injuries are treated by the NHS. Headley Centre can accommodate up to 180 patients, but last year the staff were relocated to a nearby hotel to make room for more patients. There is already a project under way to house them in temporary accommodation on site and part of today's \u00a324m will go towards providing permanent facilities for staff. Last year also saw a dispute over plans to provide accommodation for patients' families in a renovated house near the centre. More than 100 local residents complained to the council that the presence of services families would increase traffic and might lead to terrorist activity in their private road. Some complainants feared it would lower property values in the area. Their objections were opposed by families of injured personnel, and the planning application succeeded. The MoD is expected to confirm the details of the \u00a324m investment in a parliamentary statement, but the defence secretary will personally unveil the plans during a visit to the centre today. He is expected to meet clinic staff and injured personnel, including Lance Sergeant Adam Ball, 23, who lost a leg while on patrol in Afghanistan. Campaigners say privately that it is \"no coincidence\" that the MoD has chosen to announce the investment 24 hours before tomorrow's parade, City Salute, which will include marching Royal Marines, an RAF fly past and the projection of specially commissioned films. Funds raised will go towards building an on-site swimming pool and sports complex, proposals that the MoD is facilitating. \"We've covered the essential services that we have to provide to make Headley world class,\" the source said. \"The facilities that it would be nice to have - like a swimming pool - we're happy for charities to contribute to.\" Bryn Parry, chairman of the Help for Heroes campaign, said campaigners were pleased about the announcement, and would press ahead with their fundraising. \"It's wonderful that this is finally happening - it's been a long time waiting. But whatever the MoD is putting in is for the necessities. It won't change the fact that at the moment we have badly injured personnel being put in a bus and driven 10 miles to use one lane of a public swimming pool. Our campaign hopes to change that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
