The launch in central London this morning was being followed by television appeals on both BBC and ITV this evening, fronted by former EastEnders star Ross Kemp - the first time both networks have used the same celebrity for an appeal. Celebrities will also help staff donation hotlines at the BT Tower. Three attacks on Monrovia by Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (Lurd) rebels since June have trapped 250,000 people who had sought shelter in the city. An estimated one million people are still either trapped in appalling conditions in Liberia's cities or cut off from help in the countryside. But as west African peacekeeping troops continue to deploy in Monrovia, the 11 agencies under the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) umbrella are expanding their work in Liberia and flying in new stocks of aid. Two flights, organised by Oxfam and Save the Children, are preparing to depart for Monrovia this evening from Manston airport in Kent, following a flight last Friday carrying 38 tonnes of aid organised by medical crisis charity Merlin and funded by the Department for International Development. The DEC chief executive, Brendan Gormley, said: \"The appalling conditions caused by the climax of the bloody civil war in Liberia will lead to widespread deaths without an urgent increase in the aid effort. Immediate financial help from the public can ensure that the DEC agencies will be able to step up their vital work quickly.\" Speaking from Monrovia, Merlin's acting country manager, Karen Goodman, described the need for aid as \"desperate\". She said: \"The people here have been out in the open for days without shelter or even the bare essentials such as food and medicine. The peacekeepers may have arrived, but what we really need now is to get drugs, fresh water and shelter to as many people as we can, as quickly as possible.\" The DEC charities involved in the Liberia Crisis Appeal are: Actionaid, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International UK, Christian Aid, Concern, Merlin, Oxfam, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
