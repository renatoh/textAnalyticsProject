Years of mere intermittent threats to Bayern Munich\u2019s dominance have made Borussia Dortmund, Germany\u2019s most visible other club and the champions\u2019 most frequent irritants, the default opposition for a showpiece. More than 40 years have passed since Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were champions for a fifth and as yet final time, an era in which the mantle of top dogs was a real back-and-forth. In the 1970s, Gladbach\u2019s first two titles and last three were split by a Bayern run of three in succession. It may be way too early to declare a similar state of suspense but something has changed, and not only because the last time Gladbach were top for this long was that 1976-77 season in which Jupp Heynckes, Rainer Bonhof, Allan Simonsen and company swept Die Fohlen to the Meisterschale. Bayern were here and worse at this time last year, trailing Dortmund by nine points. It does, however, feel \u201cdifferent\u201d this time around, as Joshua Kimmich remarked in the corridors of Borussia-Park as Saturday evening drew in. It was hard to think any other way, or even to think at all, after this whirlwind of an occasion. This was the sort of afternoon on which Bayern\u2019s motto of Mia San Mia \u2013 we are who we are \u2013 seems meaningful and not just a marketing buzzphrase. Whatever their issues in terms of leadership, personnel and team identity, they always show up for occasions such as this. Having arrived four points behind Gladbach they spent the first half pinning their hosts back, and it was exactly what we expected. Their dominance over Marco Rose\u2019s team continued after the break, until the twists that turned this from an engrossing contest into something which felt even more significant. The sense of throwback lasted into the night as ZDF, whose Sportschau broadcasts free highlights on Saturday evenings, received a raft of complaints after the presenter Matthias Opdenh\u00f6vel accidentally let the result slip before the programme started, not realising his microphone was on. The idea that, in late 2019 and with the ubiquity of social media, viewers can genuinely avoid the result of a Saturday afternoon fixture until the evening is a heartwarming one and fed into the feeling of this being a special day, the suspense of which should be fully embraced. Still, it was one of those rare matches that will continue to bear repeated viewing, even if you know what\u2019s coming \u2013 a version of The Usual Suspects among football matches, if you like, offering finer detail and greater nuance on each watch. It was, improbably, Gladbach who ended triumphant after spending most of the match\u2019s first hour hanging on. Their stirring comeback \u201cleft a whole region in jubilation\u201d, as Westdeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Achim M\u00fcller put it, and the celebrations were full of meaning, even if it\u2019s too soon to talk about pivotal events. As fans in the Nord Kurve behind the goal celebrated with their delirious players Marcus Thuram, a pest for Bayern all afternoon who had won the late penalty which was the game\u2019s decisive moment, wandered over to the corner flag, put Ramy Bensabaini\u2019s shirt on it and waved it in triumph at the fans. The pair were both playing in France last season, Thuram\u2019s efforts failing to keep Guingamp up while Bensabaini played his part in the Coupe de France triumph for Rennes. Here, in entirely another dimension of heat and adrenalin, they played crucial roles. Bensabaini\u2019s towering header on the hour from Jonas Hofmann\u2019s corner equalised Ivan Perisic\u2019s opener and wrested his team back into the game. As stoppage time kicked in Thuram, a revelation in his debut Bundesliga season, improbably found another burst of pace to tear behind Bayern\u2019s back line. Javi Mart\u00ednez stretched and hauled him over, with the referee Marco Fritz pointing to the spot and showing Mart\u00ednez a second yellow card. As Bayern came to terms with Fritz\u2019s adjudication and struggled to retain their composure, Gladbach had to scrabble to find theirs. It took a reminder from the bench \u2013 and specifically the reserve goalkeeper Tobi Sippel \u2013 that Bensabaini was the nominated penalty taker. After Breel Embolo missed against Freiburg last week the Algerian defender, a regular and confident spot-kicker in training, volunteered to step up for the next one, not for a second thinking that it would end up being a kick of such magnitude. \u201cI honestly forgot [having volunteered] when it was given,\u201d he said with a smile. The surety with which Bensabaini struck it home defied the confusion. Manuel Neuer read it, but still couldn\u2019t stop it. Gladbach had their sixth home win in a row, and Bayern were beaten. For Hansi Flick it was \u201cjust like last week against Leverkusen\u201d, he told Sky. His team had played well but failed to take advantage. Both Kimmich and Neuer, meanwhile, talked about Bayern having dropped their intensity after they took the lead. \u201cWe deserved to take the lead,\u201d said Kimmich, \u201cbut then we stopped playing brave football.\u201d Gladbach, on the other hand, rode their luck on occasion but reaped the reward for their show of guts. Rose had thrown on the hero of last week, Embolo, for the midfielder L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e9nes just before Bensabaini\u2019s first, and never looked back. \u201cAfter the equaliser we didn\u2019t try just to manage the game, but to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, the game has two halves.\u201d The question now becomes whether Gladbach \u2013 seven ahead of Bayern but just a single point in front of Leipzig \u2013 can do what Dortmund did not last year and maintain the gap until Christmas. That expectations on them have changed so much is more than just a pinch of nostalgia. It is a huge compliment to Rose and Gladbach, and a shot in the arm for the Bundesliga\u2019s present. Talking points \u2022 Leipzig had been heading for the top until Bensabaini\u2019s late intervention, courtesy of a 3-1 win against Hoffenheim, which wasn\u2019t quite as easy as it looked but Timo Werner took his personal tally to nine in the past five games. The striker also spoke of his aim to \u201ctake the momentum into the summer\u201d, hoping to have more of an influence on Euro 2020 than he did in the World Cup. \u2022 It was a good weekend for Dortmund too, leapfrogging Bayern after sweeping aside a feeble Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf 5-0. Playing in an all-black 110th anniversary kit \u2013 the limited run of 9,009 replicas sold out in three hours \u2013 there were two goals apiece for Marco Reus and Jadon Sancho in a fine tuneup for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League meeting with Slavia Prague, with BVB needing to win and hoping for a favour from Barcelona. \u2022 It\u2019s on again at the bottom after Paderborn\u2019s dramatic first away win at Werder Bremen. Sven Michel\u2019s goal was initially ruled out but then verified by VAR to move Steffen Baumgart\u2019s team off the bottom and within four points of the play-off place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
