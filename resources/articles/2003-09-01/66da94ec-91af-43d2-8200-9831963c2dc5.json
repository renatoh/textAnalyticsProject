Beattie's winner against Manchester United yesterday was his second important contribution of the season after his equaliser during the 2-2 draw at Leicester last month, and the pressure of following last term's 23 goals does not appear to bother him. Strachan and Sir Alex Ferguson paid tribute to Beattie, with United's manager making it plain that the 25-year-old is no easier to deal with just because everyone now knows what to expect. \"Beattie is a good old fashioned centre-forward and he causes you problems,\" Ferguson said. \"He is powerful in the air, but his goal was not about climbing above anyone, it was just falling and nodding it into the net.\" Beattie knew little about his winner - \"It hit me on the side of the head, but they all count\" - though Strachan felt the scorer deserved the goal after running selflessly throughout. \"Hard work gets you everything,\" he said. \"James' tempo was good today. He covered a lot of miles and he deserved [the goal]. He and Kevin were fantastic in making sure they defended for us quickly.\" Strachan feels Southampton's campaign is \"right under way\" after three draws. United, however, have stuttered after an unblemished start and Ferguson admitted his team had not performed well in a generally poor match. \"There was nothing very inspirational out there,\" he said. \"We had only one real attack in the first half and that was from Ryan Giggs. \"Don't take anything away from Southampton but maybe a better result would have been a draw. Of course we're disappointed. When somebody scores at that time of the day it's very difficult to come back but we are a team who have shown we can get over our disappointments.\" Ferguson was full of praise for Tim Howard, who impressed for United but erred for Beattie's goal. \"He had an excellent game, absolutely superb,\" he said. \"He felt he had a little push on the goal, but I didn't see that. We're delighted with his form.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
