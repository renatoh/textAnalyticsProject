Whistleblowers at the University of Derby said the university deliberately withheld or misreported survey returns from some graduates who stated that they were unemployed, and so submitted flattering figures to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), which artificially boosted Derby's position in university league tables. The university denied the allegation and \u2013 following a request by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) \u2013 published an independent evaluation by PwC that it said showed the university acted in accordance with data collection rules. This July, Hesa published employment data for 2012 graduates that placed Derby in the upper echelon of universities with 96.1% in employment or further study \u2013 above Cambridge with 94.9% and Oxford with 92%. The 96.1% figure for 2012 graduates was well above Derby's record in previous Hesa surveys. The previous year, 85.8% of 2011 Derby graduates were working or studying. The data was supplied to Hesa by Derby, which like all universities is required to collect statistics on the destination of at least 80% of its graduates six months after they leave university. But insiders say Derby reached its minimum response rate only after ignoring \"unemployed\" responses received through telephone surveys. \"When we started doing the data entry we were told not to enter the unemployed responses.\" According to some of those who worked on compiling the data, some unemployed graduates' responses were altered in status to \"other\", which is supposed to indicate that an individual might be travelling abroad, pregnant, or unable to work for health reasons. In response, Derby supplied a copy of the independent evaluation by PwC to the Guardian. The report said PwC tested a sample of 100 respondents and found no misreporting that would have improved the university's statistics. The report also said that the increase in employment rates between 2012 and 2013 could be attributed to a number of factors, including better supervision and a concentration on a \"target group\" of students with 1st and 2:1 degree classes. A spokesperson for the university said: \"The university is profoundly disappointed to see these unfounded allegations being aired, particularly when it notified the Guardian that it had commissioned a full and detailed independent audit. \"It will be noted that not only does it wholly exonerate the university, confirming that it acted completely in accordance with the data collection rules, it also highlights instances where the university was unduly cautious in its approach to those rules in the way that it chose to classify students.\" The employment survey forms part of the \"key information sets\", statistics championed by the government as an example of student consumer power. These affect the standing of universities in league tables featured on Unistats, an official website designed to help prospective students make informed choices. Shabana Mahmood, shadow minister for universities and science, said prospective students relied on such resources when deciding where to study. She said: \"Life-changing decisions are made on the basis of this information and so it is crucial that the underpinning data is robust and represents the most accurate picture possible.\" \u2022 This article was updated and amended on Tuesday 1 October 2013 following Derby University's statement and release of an independent evaluation by PwC."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
