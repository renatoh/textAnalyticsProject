It's not wrong to celebrate in style", "bodyText": "Rebecca Mead says she agrees with the Rev Dr Giles Fraser, who claimed on Radio 4's Thought for The Day that weddings have become \"overblown, narcissistic productions\" and that such ceremonies have \"become a threat to marriage itself\" (Princess for a day, 7 August). Mead uses Chelsea Clinton as an example to back up her argument. However, I thought Chelsea looked beautiful: she's the ex-US president's daughter, so of course her wedding was going to be over the top! Yes, some brides do put themselves under undue pressure to look their best, to have the most talked-about wedding, to have the most expensive venue. But when that same bride has a baby, or moves house, she'll be equally obsessive about which buggy brand to buy, or which kitchen to have fitted. In the past, brides had no say in their wedding, as it was generally paid for and organised by her parents. Nowadays, with the average bride and groom being 29 and 31 respectively, the couple are already financially and socially independent, and therefore want greater control over the most important day of their lives. Here I agree with Mead, who says: \"With the transition into marriage meaning so much less than it once did, weddings must be made to mean so much more.\" I edit Brides magazine, and with more than 90% of our readers living with their partner before their wedding day, the wedding night is no longer the first night of intimacy. Now, of course, modern couples split the bills, and many have already lived alone at university; the main shift from being engaged to marriage for a lot of couples I speak to is \"just a lovely feeling of feeling more secure and committed\". The reality of marriage often hits later, but it is ridiculous for Mead to say that \"the notion that the idealised moment of a wedding day has anything to do with the messy, lived-in reality of marriage is something that the wedding industry has an astonishing capacity to gloss over\". Would she prefer that wedding shops posted recent divorce rates in their windows, or that vicars handed out warnings that marriage can be bad for your ego and bank balance? Would anyone get married if they truly knew the emotional compromise, hard work, family pressures and financial worries a long-term marriage really requires? It's unlikely. And why dampen the happiness of a couple who go into their union with excitement and belief that they've met their lifelong partner? Finally, Mead blames the wedding industry for the ills of marriage, claiming \"the fact that [a wedding] has been turned into an extended shopping opportunity amounts, inevitably to a degradation of its larger significance\". As someone who wholeheartedly embraced what the industry had to offer for my own wedding, I simply don't agree. We live in a consumer society. To suggest that weddings are somehow above this is naive. The demand is there before the supply. Our readers are desperate for ideas, images of dresses, great honeymoon destinations. Who says that just because you want to celebrate in style \u2013 with a show-stopping dress, fabulous Louboutins, \"freeze-dried rose petals [and] butterfly-release kits\" \u2013 you're not taking your marriage vows seriously?
