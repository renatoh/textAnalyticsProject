The draft, which is still subject to widespread consultation with the wider party, would change the role of associations as well as returning the final choice of leader to MPs. But ahead of today's official publication, complete with its new \"statement of values\", it also confirmed there will be 15 reasons why a sitting candidate can in future be removed, ranging from \"falsification of a CV\" to \"inadequate performance\" and causing \"embarrassing media coverage\". When the package was shown to Tory backbenchers at Westminster last night shortly after receiving shadow cabinet endorsement, a string of MPs, including supporters of the unseated ex-MP Howard Flight, attacked it. None spoke wholeheartedly insupport. Edward Leigh, Douglas Hogg, Alastair Burt, all former ministers, and John Hayes were said to be among last night's critics. The setback for Mr Howard, in a party not given to full-frontal attacks on its own leaders, reflects repressed anger during the election campaign over the ruthless ditching of Mr Flight as a party vice chairman and MP for Arundel because of his rash views on public spending cuts. Since David McLean, the Tory chief whip, has spoken of the need for a performance-based contract for MPs they took the 15-point list, drafted by deputy Tory chairman, Raymond Monbiot, as being aimed at them. Most Tory backbenchers favour the changes to the leadership rules, on the grounds that they know candidates better than activists do and that the leader should have the full support of the parliamentary party. But there is concern that the package of measures is part of an attempt to centralise power, at a time when all the main parties are preaching decentralisation. Party officials stress that the advice, distributed by the whips, is entirely separate from proposed changes to the constitution and say that the guidance was provided because of requests from new MPs. They also argue that the constitution would give activists more influence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
