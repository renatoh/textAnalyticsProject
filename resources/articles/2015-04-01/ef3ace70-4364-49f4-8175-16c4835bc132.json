The important thing to remember about the spin room is that if one of the leaders took a kitten out of their pocket and shot it live on stage, there would be someone from their party on hand afterwards to cast the incident positively. \u201cOoh, I think you\u2019re wrong, Emily, I think he showed real guts out there. His own, as well as the kitten\u2019s. Being prime minister is about doing some very difficult things and doing them decisively.\u201d It is the Westminster museum of artless bullshit, containing well over 300 talking exhibits. More lies are told here than on all the world\u2019s dating profiles put together. Hacks, politicians and spin doctors are condemned to scurry about, indulging in wanton political frottage, while the TV networks flaunt their ever expanding array of debate-related gizmos: live worms, insta-polls, giant malfunctioning touchscreens, mobile Karen Silkwood shower units. As far as spin-room formalities go, you know the drill: once the telly debate has finished \u2013 in fact, well before it has finished \u2013 party operatives are released to explain to TV and print journalists why that shambles is exactly what a rainbow coalition would look like, or why Nigel was absolutely right to attack the studio audience because it just shows how relaxed he is out there. People who genuinely want to be foreign secretary \u2013 people who already are the actual chief secretary to the actual treasury \u2013 wander round trying to parrot the same centrally scripted \u201cobservation\u201d to as many anchors and reporters as they can. Naturally, the spinners-in-chief clamber out of their coffins for a feed: your Craig Olivers, your Tom Baldwins. Think of them as the League of Extraordinarily Awful Gentlemen, their mission being to save the electorate from the peril of forming its own opinions. \u201cIt\u2019s already clear the biggest loser tonight was David Cameron,\u201d Douglas Alexander was saying repeatedly. \u201cThere was a real alternative prime minister on stage, and that was Ed Miliband.\u201d Fairly sure he said those precise words at the last debate a couple of weeks back, so Labour might want to check there isn\u2019t a problem with the software. Taking a slightly different tack on Cameron\u2019s absence was Jeremy Hunt. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t invited,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThe format the broadcasters wanted was for the challengers.\u201d He turned to repeat himself to the next camera crew, only for the smile to fall off his face at the discovery that they were from Vice News. \u201cVice News \u2026 I\u2019m sorry \u2026 I\u2019m going to \u2026\u201d Pretend you\u2019re getting a phone call? Ah no \u2013 you\u2019re going to let them chase you as you make a panicked trot away in search of someone you perceive as more worthy of your soundbite. \u201cOur lot at home would have been getting more and more worked up during that,\u201d a Ukip huddle were agreeing. You could see a TV producer wondering whether pickings were slim enough to get one of them on, or whether she could get away with waiting for Douglas Alexander without being bawled out by her studio anchor, like that bit in The Day Today where Chris Morris shouts at his hapless correspondent: \u201cPeter! You\u2019ve lost the news!\u201d Despite having no skin in the game, the Tories were allowed spin in the game, with the broadcasters cravenly having agreed to let their people into the room to trash the leaders who did show up. I\u2019d like to tell you that everyone ignored the likes of William Hague on principle, but you might have seen the telly footage of hacks crowding round him like he was giving out free girlfriends. \u201cCoalition of chaos,\u201d was the Conservatives\u2019 pre-programmed soundbite, and they weren\u2019t going to let up on it. Notable absentees? I didn\u2019t spot either David Axelrod or Jim Messina, the former Obama campaign bigwigs who have been hired by Labour and the Tories respectively for seriously big bucks \u2013 or rather, seriously big pounds. They would both always have been locked-on fixtures for Spin Alley during US elections, but presumably regard it as way too infra dig to get involved in this excruciating tribute act. Frankly, the spin room is a location desperately in need of a sinkhole. Failing that, it is crying out for live infiltration by some telly satirist. There is a precedent for that, which I\u2019m afraid I had cause to mention last time I was forced to spend an evening in one of these spaces. After one US election debate, the Conan O\u2019Brien show somehow contrived to get its sensationally impertinent puppet, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, into Spin Alley. I urge you to watch the majestic clip that results, in which Triumph asks spinners like Karl Rove things like: \u201cSo, tell me, how painful was it when the doctor removed your sense of shame?\u201d and apologises for aiming his microphone beneath their backsides. \u201cSorry \u2013 I forgot which end the shit came out!\u201d A virulently conservative commentator got halfway down an answer about gay marriage before thinking better of it and sniffing: \u201cI don\u2019t take questions from dogs.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019ll take it, bitch!\u201d barked Triumph. That was all the way back in 2004. Unfortunately, this is Britain, 2015, where the political class still has such a tragic hard-on for all things American that it is simply unthinkable that anyone would dream of introducing a note of wanton disrespect into the venerable institution that is the post-challengers\u2019 debate spin room. Atmosphere-wise (to this outsider at least), the spin room reeks of a perverse form of chemistry as the evening wears on, a sense that something unspeakable could happen the minute the last cameras are switched off. Happily, that moment appeared to be scheduled for well after my deadline, so \u2013 in time-honoured parlance \u2013 I made my excuses and left."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
