Director Frank Henenlotter's take on things is less wholesome than Spielberg's: far seedier and gorier but, oddly, just as moving. A shy young man, Duane, comes to the rotten core of the Big Apple with a dream of revenge on the \"doctors\" who separated him from his conjoined twin, the grossly deformed and incredibly violent Belial, whom he carries around in a basket. Costing around $30,000, and shot in a flophouse motel, with many of the residents performing in the movie, this is the real deal as far as exploitation film-making goes. It has edges so rough you could injure yourself on them, the acting barely deserves the name, but the idea is so novel and the story so captivating (and bloody) that it pushes through its budgetary and technical limitations. Belial never looks even slightly realistic by Jess Pinkham but he's one of the most memorable, terrifying and involving characters in cinema. The bigger-budgeted sequels tone down the gore a bit, exchanging it for a parade of even more freakish creatures (heavily inspired by comic artist Basil Wolverton). Though diminishing returns kick in, even at their lowest ebb these films still deliver the sort of insane, unhinged thrills that today's more expensive fare never quite manages to reach.
