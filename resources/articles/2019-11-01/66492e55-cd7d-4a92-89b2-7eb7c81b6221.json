But The Art of the \u00c9tude, Tamara Stefanovich\u2019s hugely ambitious survey, confined itself to exploring the ways in which composers have taken the form in the last 100 years or so, after Chopin and Liszt had established it as a musical genre in its own right in the 19th century. Her hugely demanding recital, almost three hours of music taking in 50 piano pieces, started with Scriabin and ended at the present day. Only the first of the three parts of Stefanovich\u2019s programme was more or less chronological, taking in the iridescent chromaticism of Szymanowski\u2019s 12 \u00c9tudes Op 33, and pieces by Scriabin, Debussy and Bart\u00f3k, as well as less familiar music by Nikolay Roslavets, Arthur Louri\u00e9 and three of Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz\u2019s 10 Concert \u00c9tudes. Her mastery of the technical challenges in every one of these pieces one quickly took for granted, but the textural imagination she brought to every piece was a constant delight. She ended the sequence with Messiaen\u2019s Ile de Feu I, one of his Quatre \u00c9tudes de Rythme from 1949. The second part was devoted to studies by living composers, many of them written specifically for Stefanovich. Pieces by Unsuk Chin, John Woolrich, George Benjamin and Hans Abrahamsen were preceded by the first performance of Milica Djordjevi\u0107\u2019s Role Playing 1: Strings Attached, which doesn\u2019t involve the keyboard at all, instead using EBows to create a delicate, resonating web of sounds directly from the piano strings. A group of Vassos Nicolaou\u2019s \u00c9tudes followed, which use the sostenuto pedal to create haloes of resonance around the intensely pianistic figuration. It\u2019s hard to think of other pianists today who play contemporary music as convincingly as they play core repertoire, and even fewer who would programme Rachmaninov and Ligeti together as Stefanovich did in the last part of her marathon, alternating six of Rachmaninov\u2019s \u00c9tudes Tableaux, two from his Op 33 set, four from Op 39, with six of Ligeti\u2019s late studies. Her approach to the Rachmaninov was refreshingly unsentimental, her playing of the Ligeti pieces dazzling, with the towering, terrifying 13th \u00c9tude, L\u2019Escalier du Diable, as the coup de grace. Conceptually, musically and technically, the whole recital was a magnificent achievement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
