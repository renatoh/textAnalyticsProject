Indeed, the corpse will be so visible that even the media, which loves to pit one loud mouth against another, will avoid the subject. When historians look back on the last two decades of the twentieth century and wonder why so much attention was paid to abortion and gay marriage, they may conclude that the culture war filled a vacuum. Communism, America's great enemy during the cold war, had collapsed. The economy was either roaring or purring but in any case not coughing and wheezing. Without significant issues involving either national security or domestic life, politicians had to find something to talk about - and so they talked about sex. Privately sex is full of fascination, but publicly it is not that interesting a topic; once liberals allowed that abortion, though legal, ought to be rare - and even more strikingly, when gay activists who once defended bath houses came out in favor of marriage - little was left to say on the subject. Meanwhile the Republicans decided to redistribute income in ways so manifestly unfair that even American voters, who are almost never moved by considerations of fairness, noticed. And George W. Bush decided that fighting a successful war would enable his party to rule forever, only to discover that losing one is a recipe for electoral disaster. A failed war and an unfair economy are now on everyone's mind. Every indication suggests that this return to normal politics will continue through 2007, inevitably influencing the presidential election of 2008. Republicans will discover that mobilizing their religious base loses more voters among independents than gains them within their own party. Democrats, who once were afraid of angering feminists and non-believers, will choose between Barack Obama, who is quite public in his religious views, or Hilary Clinton, who has always sought the middle ground on the abortion issue. When I was in graduate school in political science in the 1960s, I learned that politicians always gravitate toward the center. They have not done this for some time. Now they will, and as they do, American politics is likely to become far less inflammatory - and, for that reason, far more sensible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
