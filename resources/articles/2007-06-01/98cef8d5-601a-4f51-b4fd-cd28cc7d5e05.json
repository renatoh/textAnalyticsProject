Jonathan Cape \u00a320, pp672 Jack the Ripper: the 21st-Century Investigation, by Trevor Marriott. John Blake \u00a37.99, pp288 Establishing the identity of the psychopath who killed and mutilated somewhere between five (the 'canonical' number) and 11 prostitutes in Whitechapel in 1888-89 has launched both ingenious and lunatic flights of fancy almost since the crimes were committed. But the best books produced by the Ripper industry are the ones in which serious researchers have trawled local history archives to add to what little is really known. Then someone such as Charles van Onselen comes along. The Fox and the Flies is the biography of Joseph Silver, a 'racketeer and psychopath... a brothel-owner, pimp and trafficker in women on four continents... burglar, gun-runner, jewel-thief, rapist, safe-cracker and sodomist... police informer'. Phew. Oh, and he was also Jack the Ripper. As an insight into the dark underbelly of urban life in the late Victorian and Edwardian era, The Fox and the Flies is compelling reading. Van Onselen, an academic by training, has searched many archives to find important but depressing details about the white slave trade, in which women from Eastern Europe were trafficked for prostitution around the world. The central focus is on Silver, born Joseph Lis in Kielce, Poland, but with numerous other aliases. And those aliases are where things start to go wrong in this obsessive biography. For what emerges is a Zelig-like figure that van Onselen puts into a range of historical situations. In doing so, he piles detail on ancillary detail, with footnotes that don't say much that's pertinent. What Van Onselen essentially produces is a postmodern biography - which means he's producing faction. He strings together a list of incidents that he applies to Joseph Silver, although there seems little evidence that his subject was involved in many of the events described. And, weirdly for a book partly sold on this premise, he produces no real proof that Silver was Jack the Ripper. There is a template to Ripper writing. First, review all the available evidence and theories, then come up with your own suspect. That is ex-cop Trevor Marriott's problem. In Jack the Ripper: the 21st-Century Investigation he provides an overview well enough (plumping for nine victims) but is saddled with the need to say who the Ripper was. He then turns initial speculation into assumed fact and presents a wodge of information that leads nowhere. For example, he gets excited about merchant ships docking during the period of the Whitechapel murders and focuses on The Sylph. You wade through the detail assuming it's going to go somewhere. It doesn't. The main problem for all Ripperologists is that the contemporary evidence doesn't provide any clue about the identity of the Ripper - and what remains of that evidence is pretty scanty. The few original documents that have survived in the National Archive in Kew are published this month. Most of the rest have been lost or stolen. What remains has a gruesome fascination but shows the police were as clueless as anybody else. Not that that will stop other theorists using them like the Kabbalah to produce other interpretations. Until the next time, then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
