The Lebanese millionaire is a master at employing the 'us-and-them' approach to squeeze the gain from every situation, Wimbledon's unlikely FA Cup victory over Liverpool in 1988 being the prime example. And having trousered \u00a338million from the sale of the Dons, he then spotted the same potential at Cardiff City, broadening his mandate from leader of the Crazy Gang to unelected leader of Welsh footballing ambitions. Hammam, whose public displays of wackiness personified Wimbledon, has been keeping a low profile since last season's infamous Ninian Park walkabout during Cardiff's 2-1 FA Cup defeat of Leeds United. But in an interview published last week in a local newspaper, and actually conducted two months ago, Hammam was playing the nationalist card. 'Wales have moved up to fiftieth in the Fifa rankings and people think that is great, which it is, compared to being 104th,' he said. 'But Mark Hughes is a street fighter like I am and I bet he's not satisfied. If we have a powerful Premiership club here, full of good young Welsh players, then the national team will be advantaged. And those players who don't make it with us at the highest level can filter through to other Welsh clubs... making them stronger too. So everyone gains.' Owner-chairman Hammam is, not surprisingly, extremely popular with the Ninian Park crowd. This season the Bluebirds have attracted an average home gate of nearly 13,000. Today's final is Cardiff's biggest game since they beat Leyton Orient at Ninian Park, 20 years ago, to gain promotion into the old Second Division. Hammam has brought the good times again. 'Ultimately I want us to produce a Premiership team here which every Welsh person can take pride in and feel a part of,' he said earlier in the season. 'I'm not just talking about the three million population, but the millions of others from places like Australia, America, Argentina who have Welsh ancestry. I don't have the statistics, but if I'm guessing I would say we can draw upon the support of 10 million to 15 million people. If we organise this properly, we are a country that can really go far.' It would not harm Cardiff's finances, either. Having squeezed into the play-offs in sixth place, Lennie Lawrence's team made the final by a single Peter Thorne strike against Bristol City. If they do go up, City's home of nearly 100 years may go. The club are in talks with the council for a new 30,000-capacity ground at Leckwith - with the option of expansion to double that amount - just across the Ninian Park car park where a half built athletics stadium currently stands. Negotiations have rumbled on for a time, though, and they are not counting on it. Much depends on today's result. Lawrence's men trounced QPR at Loftus Road 4-0 early in the season and lost the return last month 2-1. With all of their 33,000 ticket allocation gone within 10 minutes of going on sale - their internet server crashed under the weight of more than 100,000 enquiries - the Millennium Stadium today will feel very much like home.
