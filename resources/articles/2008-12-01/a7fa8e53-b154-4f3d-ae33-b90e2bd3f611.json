Seven years earlier Watford had reached a different conclusion about Young and, but for Cummins, the club's assistant academy director at the time and the scout who discovered \"this skinny lad from Stevenage\", a promising talent might have gone to waste. Young was informed at 16 that he would not be offered a full-time contract at Vicarage Road because of reservations over whether he would be strong enough to become a professional footballer. Normally a rejected teenager would try to find another club or consider an alternative career but, through a combination of Cummins's unwavering belief, the player's perseverance and a chance meeting with David Platt his fortunes changed. Young, encouraged by Cummins, reached an agreement whereby he could play for Watford's youth team on a non-contract basis. It allowed him to retain an involvement with the club although there were no wages on offer while training sessions took place with a younger age group rather than the full-time scholars. It was hardly the basis for breaking through but fate was smiling on Young when Platt, then the England Under-21 manager, telephoned Watford. \"We knew David at Watford and he wanted a practice game but he was short of a couple of players,\" said Cummins. \"We had a youth team game but we said to David, who was after a winger, Ashley will come along and play for you. It turned out he was the best player there yet he didn't have a contract with us. David Platt said he was fantastic. From then on he went on to get a pro contract, didn't end up playing in the reserves and went straight into the first-team and scored on his debut.\" Young has been doing more than making up the numbers since Platt's phone call, with his emergence at Watford and subsequent \u00a39.5m transfer to Aston Villa completing a turnaround that has rewarded the player's determination as much as Cummins's faith. Although Watford have not been so quick to reward Cummins, a settlement is close to being agreed for the part that he played in identifying Young and bringing him to the club as a schoolboy. \"Ashley was picked up when he was about 10 years old,\" recalled Cummins, who is assistant manager of Toronto FC after a brief spell at Luton. \"I actually scouted him and invited him to the club. He liked to get on the ball and run with the ball and that was the first thing you saw in him. He wasn't blessed with great physical attributes. I've got pictures of the teams he played in and, when you look at them now, you would think that he was the mascot. But I'm a great believer in talent as opposed to physique. \"When it got to decision time at 15 and 16, people were umming and ahhing. I think if people are honest about it, a lot of them were questioning his size. I kept saying, 'be patient, give it time', because he was technically gifted, a great athlete and he knew the game. In the end he was given a non-contract and he would train with the U-16s in the evenings when he was an U-17. He stayed with it, which is credit to the lad, because people had said 'we don't think you're going to make it'.\" Cummins, who was sacked by Watford two weeks before Young was sold, admits that he smiles now when he hears O'Neill joke about the England international's slender frame. \"We used to say he was four stone wet through,\" he says. He never questioned his ability, however. \"When you are a youth coach you have to put your faith in players. There will be plenty that I got wrong and Ashley is one of the lucky ones who I could see something a little bit different in. Those who doubted him at Watford, and he knows who they are, he's gone on to prove them [all] wrong.\" For Cummins, the sense of satisfaction is understandable. \"You're always looking for your first million-pound player. That's when you think 'we've cracked it'. All of a sudden this skinny lad from Stevenage goes for about \u00a39.5m which is unbelievable. It's great that someone like Martin O'Neill saw more development in him. People might have been questioning the price tag but it's money well spent now. I've saw both of his goals against Everton last weekend and I was chuffed to bits. He's got a fantastic future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
