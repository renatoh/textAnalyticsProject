When Barty finished the final here on Saturday with a smash that sent the ball bouncing high into the seats on Court Philippe Chatrier to beat the Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova, 6-1, 6-3, in an hour and 10 minutes, she looked dumbstruck and mouthed: \u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d It was a typically down-to-earth reaction from a widely respected player her compatriot Pat Cash describes as \u201cextremely popular\u201d in the locker room. Cash, who reached the fourth round here in 1988 and now works for Eurosport, added: \u201cWhere she has come in the last year is just incredible. She was a decent player and a very good doubles player \u2013 and the next thing you know, she\u2019s a grand slam champion.\u201d Collecting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (a free spirit from the Jazz Age who would have cheered her immediate reaction to winning), Barty emulated Court but ignored that courtside observation, preferring to namecheck her fellow Australian and contemporary Sam Stosur, who reached the final in 2010. Court, 76, is very much from another era, with different values. The West Australian, whose 24 majors are unmatched in tennis history, said in an interview two years ago the sport was \u201cfull of lesbians\u201d, provoking anger inside and outside the game. Barty was moved to support her doubles partner, Casey Dellacqua, who has two children with her partner, Amanda Judd. But beaming non-stop in one interview after another, Barty on Saturday nominated one former champion above all others as her inspiration: Evonne Goolagong Cawley. Victory made Barty the first Australian woman since Cawley in 1976 to reach No 2 in the world. It is doubly satisfying for her because they share an indigenous heritage, proud representatives of their race and their country. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Barty said. \u201cEvonne sent me a text a couple days ago and said this was her first grand slam [among seven]. I spotted her name on the trophy. I\u2019ll give her a call a little bit later on. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing she\u2019s created this path for indigenous tennis in Australia. Now it\u2019s becoming more nationwide. There are more opportunities for kids to start playing tennis, both male and female. Hopefully we can continue to create those opportunities and let kids know that this is an option for a career and they can enjoy it. And even if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a sport they can play for life.\u201d Barty is also a straight-talking hero to other players, present and former \u2013 including Gabriela Sabatini, who earlier in the week nominated her as her favourite player. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely kind of her. When I started playing tennis, I tried to build a unique style. I tried to build my own style. There were players that were dominant who I looked up to. In particular that was Evonne. When I got a little bit older, I began to realise what she achieved and just how remarkable that was. But there are so many amazing players, gracious players, who have this style and this flair that I always tried to emulate when I was a kid. \u201cMy coach always used to bring me back and say: \u2018We\u2019re creating our style.\u2019 That\u2019s probably one of the most magical things that\u2019s happened to me.\u201d Barty quit tennis in 2014 when the pressure of expectation became too much for her. She was marked down as a prodigy from her earliest days, and nine years ago spent time in Las Vegas with Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi as part of a youth development programme. At 15, she was girls\u2019 champion at Wimbledon. Within two years she was a three-times doubles slam finalist. In September 2014, after losing at the US Open, she was burned out \u2013 and turned to cricket, where she did well enough to play in the women\u2019s Big Bash tournament in Australia. \u201cIn 12 months she could\u2019ve played for Australia,\u201d the Queensland coach, Andy Richards, told AAP\u2019s Darren Walton this week. However, while her sabbatical cleared her troubled mind, tennis drew her back in 2016. She admits she might never have played again had she not taken that break. \u201cI needed time to step away, to live a normal life, because this tennis life certainly isn\u2019t normal. I needed time to grow as a person, to mature. I left all of my options open. It was just a natural progression for me coming back to tennis.\u201d On Saturday it all came together as she dismantled the hitherto unassailable Vondrousova, who did not drop a set reaching the final, and came from 5-3 down twice to beat Johanna Konta in the semi-finals. Barty\u2019s serve, the core of her game, was too strong and incisive for the elegant Czech, and she took her ace count to 38, the most in the tournament. \u201cMy serve is a massive part of my game,\u201d she said, \u201cand I try and think my way around the court. I know where opponents like to return and, if they shift their position, where they return. I try and expose those spots as best that I can.\u201d Barty now heads for Wimbledon and her favourite surface. \u201cI know I\u2019m playing good tennis,\u201d she said, without a hint of arrogance. \u201cWimbledon is a long way away, and I have to be able to celebrate this with my team, take a few days off, make sure I get my body and mind right so that, when I come out to play my next tournament, I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d She has pulled out of Nottingham but will play Birmingham and Eastbourne before Wimbledon. She will, no doubt, receive the warmest of receptions \u2013 including from her parents, Josie and Robert, who flew into London on Saturday and watched her triumph on television there. \u201cI love the grass court season. Hopefully I can bring some really good level of tennis again to give myself a chance to go deep in a major again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
