Martyn Day, of the law firm Leigh, Day &amp; Co, said that if the MoD did not come up with an out-of-court compensation scheme in two months, a no-win, no-fee group action on behalf of 350 veterans would be launched in the high court. The veterans say they were not told they were being subjected to chemical warfare agents at the MoD's chemical defence establishment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
