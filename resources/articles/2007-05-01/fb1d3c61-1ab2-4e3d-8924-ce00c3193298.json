The burger chain may offer super-size meals but it wants to slim down the English language, by losing the word \"McJob\". That, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is \"an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects.\" Not true, says the fast-food giant, which yesterday formally began a campaign to rub the word out of existence. On its side are such lexicographical experts as Digby Jones, former head of the CBI and possibly the real-life incarnation of David Brent (he even ranked Tina Turner's The Best among his Desert Island Discs). The folk at the OED have been lobbied before. Last year potato growers protested outside their smart Oxford offices. The cause of their ire? The entry \"couch potato\". Dictionary compilers point out that their definitions describe, rather than prescribe, how a word is used. They also usually wait a decade before entering a neologism. The OED has far more offensive terms: racist epithets and other abusive language, such as \"chav\" and \"pikey\". \"McDonald's\" is in there too, as \"any service ... operating in a highly efficient, standardised manner\". The company finds nothing to complain about there. Might this campaign be a clever bit of publicity-seeking? The firm spent \u00a333m last year on UK advertising, yet can't win the public's love. If that's what McDonald's wants, it should concentrate on redefining itself rather than our language."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
