Acknowledging there has been a complete breakdown of trust in the sport, the president outlined a 10-point plan to begin the task of rebuilding the International Association of Athletics Federations and the sport itself. \u201cBe under no illusion about how seriously I take these issues. I am president of an international federation which is under serious investigations and I represent a sport under intense scrutiny,\u201d he said. French prosecutors have accused Lord Coe\u2019s predecessor, Lamine Diack, and his son, the former IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack, of conspiring to cover up positive drug tests in return for payment along with other senior IAAF officials. \u201cMy vision is to have a sport that attracts more young people. The average age of those watching track and field is 55. This is not sustainable,\u201d Coe said. \u201cThe key to making that vision a reality is creating a sport that people once more trust in. Athletics must be a sport that athletes, fans, sponsors, media and parents alike know is safe to compete in on a level playing field and one in which clean effort is rewarded and celebrated.\u201d Since being elected in August, Coe has been beset by problems including corruption and cover up claims that go right to the heart of the previous administration, during a period when Coe was a vice-president, and evidence of systemic state-sponsored doping by Russia. The double Olympic gold medallist was also forced to relinquish his role as a global ambassador for Nike amid claims of a conflict of interest and blindsided by leaked emails that showed his right-hand man, Nick Davies, appeared in 2013 to be considering how to suppress news of positive Russian tests. Coe has outlined many of the reforms before but has now promised to deliver most of them in six months. They include a complete reorganisation of the governing body with clear lines of responsibility, including the appointment of a chief executive, and greater vetting of IAAF officials. He said the work being undertaken by Deloitte and Freshfields to review the IAAF\u2019s operations and finances, overseen by the former London 2012 chief executive Paul Deighton, would be delivered to the IAAF Council by March and completed by mid-2016. By the same date, he promised a new \u201cintegrity unit\u201d dealing with doping, corruption, betting and age manipulation issues would be operational and the anti-doping budget of $4m (\u00a32.7m) a year would be doubled. The IAAF has come in for intense criticism over the way it has handled the wave of doping revelations sparked by an explosive German documentary broadcast by ARD in December 2014 and associated cheating and corruption allegations in the French and British media. Next week, Dick Pound is expected to deliver the second part of his Wada commissioned report into the issues, including further detail on \u201ccorruption and bribery practices at the highest levels of international athletics\u201d. Michael Beloff\u2019s independent IAAF ethics committee is considering its own sanctions against some of the individuals involved in the Russian case. The IAAF has banned the Russian athletics federation from competition pending an overhaul of its anti-doping system and will decide in March whether it should return in time for the Olympics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
