Opens Thursday We think of the author of 'La Gioconda' as the most famous painter of them all, but while he sometimes signed his letters 'Leonardus Vincius, pictor', he thought of himself first as a sculptor. But perhaps even more so as an engineer: the term 'design' to suggest the practical application of ingenuity and art had not yet gained currency, although its etymology goes back to Leonardo's day. 'Disegno' literally means drawing, but Leonardo took mere draughtsmanship beyond craft. Drawing became in and of itself a part of the creative process, as the V&amp;A's superb new exhibition shows. 'Obstinate vigour' were his watchwords. Throughout his life intolerant of the commonplace, Leonardo was indefatigable in his pursuit of invention, worrying out new ideas in thousands upon thousands of drawings, each one a curious mix of inventive clarity and what Giorgio Vasari in The Lives of the Artists called a refined and graceful mystery. The practice of drawing to present a proposition is so familiar today that only with an imaginative effort is it possible to understand Leonardo's astonishing originality: in the late-15th and early 16th centuries, paper was an expensive rarity, a luxury product. It is estimated that in his working life Leonardo used more than 6,000 sheets of it. Only at the beginning of the 19th century when the educationalist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi published his studies on Anschauung (or 'perception') was it generally appreciated how seeing and drawing and imaginative thinking were related. Significantly, it was at just the same time that Vasari's conventional view of Leonardo became ready for development and alteration. To Vasari, Leonardo was a 'bold speculator, holding lightly by other men's beliefs, setting philosophy above Christianity'. To Walter Pater in a famous 1869 essay, he was an international man of mystery who fascinated and repelled by turns. Perhaps because of this intractable personality, fame came relatively late. A job application to Lodovico Sforza, tyrant of Milan, written aged 30, is both revealing of his personality and equally revealing of the status of the artist in the Renaissance. Leonardo says he can design bridges, waterworks (civil and military), be a demolition contractor, engineer tunnels and canals, make tanks and armoured ships as well as palaces and public buildings and other curious tricks of design. He just adds as a footnote that, by the way, he is also the best sculptor and painter of his day. He got the job and kept it for 20 years, enjoying a life of 'brilliant sins and exquisite amusements' while building the Lombard capital's impressive Navigli, nowadays a wonderful quartiere of canal-side restaurants. In Milan he made a list of life's necessities and these included books from Venice, concave mirrors, a diary note to dilate the lungs of a pig for experiments, as well as an aide-memoire to 'go every Saturday to the hot bath where you will see naked men'. Leonardo was an illegitimate homosexual, although neither was a greatly distinguishing characteristic in Renaissance Italy. Although Leonardo understood non-return valves, gear trains and roller-bearings, as well as successfully anticipating heavier-than-air flight, the key to understanding a prodigal creativity is his relationship not to mechanics but to nature, which he believed was the source of high intelligence. William Blake later realised you can see the whole world in a grain of sand, and a similar perception had led Leonardo to an amazing sequence of inventions. Importantly, the drawings reveal wilful confusions that had to wait for Freud's insights before making full sense: smiling women and turbulent waters were consistent fascinations, and one drawing on display in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum shows a torrent doing a Freudian slip into a cascade of curls. In his drawings there were always natural parallels. Studies of men and horses show how each bares teeth in extremis. Leonardo describes how a masonry dome deforms in the same way as a crushed pomegranate. Beauty and terror sit side by side in his drawings. Always there are mysteries. Yes, Leonardo designed a parachute, but what use would this have been before flight? And 'La Gioconda' has always fascinated. To Walter Pater: 'She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave.' I doubt that Mr and Mrs Dan Brown read Pater, but whether in designs for a jack or a portrait of a Milanese woman, Leonardo is a profound source of enigma. And then there is sex. Freud's 1910 essay Leonardo da Vinci and a Memory of his Childhood was inspired by the curious fused images of the Virgin and St Anne in his famous painting - perhaps a symbol of affections conflicted between his natural parent and his stepmother.Freud used Leonardo to introduce concepts of narcissism, homosexuality, oral sex, parenting and sublimation into the history of art. And it is certain Leonardo was not squeamish about such matters. In the Codex Arundel there is a list where he makes cheerful play with the word 'cazzo', Italian slang for the male intromittent organ. I asked Martin Kemp, the Oxford academic who curated this London exhibition as part of the worldwide Universal Leonardo project which he co-directs, what there was about Leonardo that made Dan Brown possible: 'He went to enormous pains to describe art and science as the remaking of nature on mathematical principles. But he knew there was something else, lying outside the compass of rational definitions. This something else, whether defined as spiritual, psychological or sexual, haunts his paintings. It has tantalised every generation of interpreters.' Indeed, the mysteries of the world are the visible not the invisible ones. On the one hand, Leonardo was a practical man. A close friend in his Milan years was Luca Pacioli, the Franciscan monk who, with his invention of double-entry book-keeping and coinage of terms such as receivables and inventories, may be considered the father of accountancy. Yet divination and clairvoyance were part of his world too. That signature mirror-writing is closer to medieval minuscule than it is to the more refined and modern italic of Michelangelo. Imagine his studio full of smoke and those concave mirrors and vials, wax, and quicksilver. As a pioneer of experimental flight he was closer to Daedalus than to Burt Rutan or Richard Branson. To Leonardo, medicine was an art and painting was a science. Pater said the smiling Mona Lisa appeared to have 'experienced the last curiosity'. Marcel Duchamp's irreverent take on his was to inscribe a copy of the painting with the letters LHOOQ, which pronounced in French comes out as 'she's got a hot arse', which explains that it is no mystery at all. Leonardo for his part saw no end to curiosity. He was magnificently and restlessly inventive, but it is perhaps wrong to interpret him as an anticipation of the modern engineer or designer. His works on paper are not engineering drawings, they are products of a ferocious artistic intelligence engaging with nature. And the results included radical designs for high-pressure pumps as well as the world's most misunderstood painting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
