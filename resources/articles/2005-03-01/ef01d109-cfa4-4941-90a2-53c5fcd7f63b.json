As well as making this Britain's most successful world championships, the madison gold broke new ground for the team: at 19, Cavendish is Britain's youngest senior track world champion, while he and Hayles are Britain's first medallists in this discipline at a world championships. Their success followed gold medals for the team sprint trio of Chris Hoy, Jason Queally and Jamie Staff in Thursday's opening session, and further golds on Saturday in the women's sprint for Victoria Pendleton and the team pursuit for Hayles, Chris Newton, Steve Cummings, Paul Manning and Ed Clancy. There were also silver and bronze for Queally and Hoy in Friday's kilometre time-trial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
