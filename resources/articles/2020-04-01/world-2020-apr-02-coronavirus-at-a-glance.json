The death toll is also close to the 50,000 mark with the current number on 47,235. British government faces testing crisis UK ministers are facing a torrent of criticism about the country\u2019s low rate of testing for coronavirus in the wake of the revelation that only 2,000 NHS staff have been tested out of more than 500,000. After the UK\u2019s record daily increase in the number of deaths, there is mounting concern and anger that the government followed a flawed strategy based more on mathematical modelling than established public health practice. Here is what the UK papers think of the testing mess. As well as facing the threat of contacting Covid-19, medical staff also face the dilemma of choosing which patients to keep on ventilators as the machines remain in short supply. US running out of protective equipment Donald Trump has admitted that the US is running down its stockpile of protective personal equipment as the nation faces a rapid rise in the number of virus cases. The US president urged states to \u201cmake a deal\u201d with manufacturers to obtain the much-needed equipment as US cases rose well past 200,000. One of the experts on Trump\u2019s virus taskforce, Anthony Fauci, has reportedly been given extra security after it emerged that he had received some threats from people critical of his views sometimes seen as contradicting the president\u2019s pronouncements Director of WHO \u2018deeply concerned\u2019 Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection\u201d. \u201cOver the past five weeks, we have witnessed a near exponential growth in the number of new cases, reaching almost every country,\u201d he said. Hope for stricken cruise ships Trump also said that Florida must allow two virus-stricken cruise ships to dock in the state to get passengers to safety. Four people have died \u2013 including one British man \u2013 and dozens of people are sick with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise liners, which are awaiting permission to enter port in Fort Lauderdale. After Trump said: \u201cWe have to help the people\u201d, Florida\u2019s governor indicated he would allow the ships to dock in Fort Lauderdale. But authorities in Guam are angry that they may have to welcome thousands of US navy personnel off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. Philippines police told to shoot unruly quarantine breakers Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has been criticised after he ordered police to shoot dead residents who break quarantine rules and refuse to co-operate. His violent threat follows the arrest of 21 people who had apparently taken to the streets of Manila to demand help from the government. Also in Asia Pacific, Australia has announced free childcare during the crisis as it continues to rollout massive financial support for the economy. And New Zealand reported its biggest one-day rise in cases. Musicians fall victim to disease Two prominent musicians have died from the disease. Adam Schlesinger, from the band Fountains of Wayne, has died aged 52. Over his career, Schlesinger earned nominations for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, Tonys, Grammys and Emmys, winning the latter two. Also, the 80s underground pop singer Cristina, from the band Things Fall Apart, has reportedly died at age 61 after being diagnosed with coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
