A week after the Commons voted by a majority of 31, less than half Labour's May 5 majority, to give the bill another chance, the standing committee which will review it clause by clause met for the first time. But Edward Garnier, the barrister leading the Tory attack, immediately protested that only one of the 10 Labour MPs serving on the 17-strong committee - David Drew, for Stroud - has shown any public doubts about the plans. Mr Drew signed the Campaign Group's critical amendment which would effectively have killed the bill, but voted with the government last week. He is said to be most concerned about mounting costs, a fear that some MPs believe will eventually allow the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to veto the whole scheme. Mr Garnier later told the Guardian it was \"intellectually dishonest that the government should construct a standing committee that does not reflect the balance of the second reading debate\" when 24 out of 33 speakers were critical. The Tory call for \"safety valves\" to help the government find a way through to an acceptable formula was echoed by the Campaign Group. Its chairman, John McDonnell, warned that \"if the government wants to ensure the bill fails by stacking the committee, they are going the right way about it\". Liberal Democrats, who have two MPs on the committee, share the concern that public dislike of ID cards will be worse when the bill returns to the Commons. Simon Davies, the privacy campaigner who helped orchestrate the fierce critiques published recently by the London School of Economics, has urged MPs to work together to find a more modest solution, possibly based on Swedish experience. They should \"break with tradition and work cooperatively\", Mr Davies told the BBC. Under the Swedish model people would retain much more control over the process of registering their identity, would be able to decide what information is stored, and would not become part of a national identification register. Mr Garnier said last night: \"The ID card is a red herring. It is really an ID registration bill. It will provide all sorts of people with a pretext to stop and ask you to prove who you are and what you are doing.\" The bill is being steered through the committee by the tough-minded new immigration minister, Tony McNulty, and Andy Burnham, his Blairite junior minister. To the dismay of some Tories, Vera Baird QC, who was recently promoted to be the home secretary's unpaid parliamentary private secretary, is also on the committee. \"She's lost her reputation for independence,\" complained Mr Garnier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
