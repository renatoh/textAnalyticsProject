McEnany, who turns 32 next week, worked for the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee on his Fox News show and as a pro-Trump commentator on CNN during the 2016 presidential election. She became national spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, then for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. A survey of past remarks and tweets suggests she is perfectly qualified for the job of being his master\u2019s voice \u2013 and attacking his nemesis, Barack Obama. For instance, she embraced the original sin of Trumpian politics: birtherism. It is the conspiracy theory that Obama, America\u2019s first black president, was not born in the US but rather in Kenya. On 29 August 2012, McEnany tweeted: \u201cHow I Met Your Brother -- Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows\u201d. Along with the spurious dig at Obama, who was born in Hawaii, the tweet also traded on stereotypes of Africans living in huts. Highlighting the tweet on Tuesday, Richard Painter, a former White House chief ethics lawyer, wrote: \u201cWhat is this? A KKK rally in the White House?\u201d As president, Trump reportedly called African nations \u201cshithole countries\u201d and said of a deadly white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia: \u201cYou also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\u201d But McEnany told the Fox Business Network in May 2018: \u201cThe president has come out multiple times saying he denounces all racism. We all denounce racism, that would include the president.\u201d In March 2017, she tried to defend Trump\u2019s frequent golfing by turning the tables on Obama over the killing of Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan. \u201cYou had President Obama, who after the \u2013 I believe it was the beheading of Daniel Pearl \u2013 spoke to how upset he was about that, then rushed off to a golf game,\u201d she claimed on CNN. \u201cI think when we\u2019re in a state of war, when we\u2019re in a state of mourning, you should take time off from the golf course.\u201d But when Pearl died in 2002, Obama was still a state senator. McEnany subsequently apologised, explaining she meant to say James Foley, a photojournalist kidnapped in Syria and beheaded by the Islamic State in 2014. According to a Washington Post count, Trump made 16,241 false or misleading claims in his first three years in office. But on 28 August 2019, McEnany told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe the president has lied.\u201d And taking her cue from the president, McEnany played down the threat of the coronavirus. On Trish Regan\u2019s Fox Business Network show in late February, she praised Trump\u2019s partial Chinese travel ban and asserted: \u201cWe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. And isn\u2019t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d Regan later parted ways with the network after calling the coronavirus an \u201cimpeachment scam\u201d. McEnany has been rewarded with a senior job at the White House. On 28 February, McEnany appeared on Fox News. \u201cWhat is bad for America is good for Democrats. It\u2019s incredible that they think this way. They root against the stock market. They root for this [coronavirus] to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking down President Trump. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there.\u201d On 11 March, with the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and then candidate Bernie Sanders having cancelled campaign rallies, she was asked on the Fox Business Network whether Trump would follow suit. She wasn\u2019t worried, she insisted. \u201cLook, we have the commander-in-chief, we have the best health experts, we are taking it day by day, we are currently proceeding as normal,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cAnd look, Joe Biden, he\u2019s suspending his rallies. He\u2019s been dying to get off the campaign trail. The man can only speak for seven minutes \u2026 The media\u2019s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies \u2026 they know it\u2019s his avenue to speak directly to the American people.\u201d Later that day, the Trump campaign did cancel rallies. Meanwhile, when it comes to the climate crisis, McEnany has a history of denying the scientific consensus that humans are heating the planet, primarily by burning fossil fuels. In 2014, when climate protesters marched during a cold winter in Washington DC, McEnany told Fox News: \u201cThe science is not settled, so let\u2019s stop the liberal hysteria, take a break from the protesting, go get some hot cocoa, sit inside.\u201d The Fox host Neil Cavuto and McEnany laughed as an Occidental College professor explained that the vast majority of qualified climatologists agreed on the climate threat. McEnany countered that \u201cin the 1970s it was global cooling\u201d and \u201cthey always change the verbiage. It\u2019s the verbiage to justify the liberal mechanisms that they would like to put in place.\u201d McEnany also claimed corruption of the scientific process, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s be real. Who\u2019s getting the grants? Who are the liberal universities giving the grants to? Of course it\u2019s going to be people who buy into the fact that global warming does exist.\u201d More recently, McEnany has shifted to focusing on the costs of addressing the climate crisis. In February, McEnany tweeted that the Democratic plan for climate change was \u201cto eliminate more than 1 million jobs in America by eliminating the fossil fuel industry. Kill the economy!\u201d Last July, she mocked the former 2020 candidates Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke for emphasizing the narrowing window for addressing the crisis. Trump\u2019s first two press secretaries were caught in lies. Sean Spicer began by claiming about Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period \u2013 both in person and around the globe.\u201d Sarah Sanders admitted that her claims that she personally communicated with \u201ccountless\u201d FBI officials about Trump\u2019s decision to fire James Comey was a \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d. Then came Stephanie Grisham, who became the press secretary and White House communications director last June but never gave a formal press briefing. Grisham will rejoin Melania Trump\u2019s office in a new role as chief of staff. McEnany is a rising star in Trumpworld despite \u2013 or because of \u2013 her misstatements. Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, said: \u201cKayleigh McEnany is a first-class professional who will serve President Trump and the American people well. She has been one of the strongest assets to the president\u2019s re-election campaign with her keen mind, positive attitude, strong faith, and tireless work ethic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
