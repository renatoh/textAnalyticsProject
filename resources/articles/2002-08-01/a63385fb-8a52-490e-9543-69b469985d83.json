This is Jackson's Law No 37. It is to do with the appreciation of aromas, flavours and diversity of style. Take my friend Tim Atkin, a man devoted to the grape. Musing one recent Sunday on summertime drinks, he opted first for wheat beers, his tone suggesting that wheat beers are familiar to all sophisticated drinkers. Not in my local, it seems, where the public bar was locked in debate as to the merits of New Zealand Chenin Blanc versus Sauvignon Blanc. Would they be so knowledgeable on the virtues of Golden Promise versus Maris Otter, two classic British malting barleys, let alone the attributes of wheat in brewing? Perhaps we are asking too much of such publicans, expecting them to understand that there are styles of beer other than lager, bitter and stout. None of those three is as refreshing as a wheat beer. Not that Britain's brewers, especially the old-established famous names, are always ready to offer such delights. Most would rather go out of business than make a more interesting beer. This is a shame, as most traditional British brewing equipment is well suited to producing wheat beers. The St Austell Brewery has deservedly won several awards for its Clouded Yellow, launched two years ago. This is flavoured with American hops from Oregon, coriander, vanilla pods and cloves. It is less obviously spicy than it sounds, with a crisp suggestion of sliced apples in cream. I cannot imagine a more suitable accompaniment to a picnic lunch. While barley's husk acts as a natural filter in the production of beer, wheat does not have this attribute, which is why barley is more commonly used in brewing. Wheat beers would typically have been cloudier than barley brews in the days before filtration. Today, most British wheat beers are bright, while the Belgians tend toward the traditional cloudy style. The Germans produce both. The Belgian town of Hoegaarden revived its wheat-beer tradition in the 60s. Many drinkers seem to have discovered Hoegaarden without realising that it is a wheat beer. For others, it is the only wheat beer, or the only one they know. It is flavoured with coriander and Cura\u00e7ao orange peel, which has become the classic Belgian way. Almost every Belgian brewing company makes one now, but only Hoegaarden has the distinctive chunky hexagonal glass. The typical haziness of most wheat brews may have contributed to their sometimes being identified as 'white' beers (Wit, Blanche, Weiss[e] in Dutch/Flemish, French, German). Or the label may simply say 'wheat' (Tarwe, Froment, Weizen). In Britain, it is hard to find the quite different North German style, Berliner Weisse, which has a lactic sharpness, usually softened by a lacing of raspberry syrup or herbal essence of woodruff. If you go to Berlin, look out for the Weissbier of the Kindl or Schultheiss breweries, The South German style, primarily made around Munich, has no added flavourings, but a fruity (often banana-like), spicy (sometimes clovey) character, deriving from the yeasts of the region. Almost every brewery in Bavaria makes a range, usually including hazy, filtered, dark and strong versions. Schneider produces spicy classics; Erdinger milder examples for the popular taste. A friend ordering a German wheat beer in an Irish pub in Kentish Town, London, the other day was told, 'Yes, we do carry one, but no sooner is it delivered than it sells out.' He went to his neighbourhood supermarket and found half a dozen variations on the theme. There's no demand for it, you see."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
