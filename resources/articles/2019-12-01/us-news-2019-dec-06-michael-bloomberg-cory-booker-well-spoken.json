Booker is one of only two African American candidates remaining in the race. Bloomberg was asked about Booker\u2019s complaint that there are \u201cmore billionaires than black people who\u2019ve made the December debate stage\u201d following the withdrawal of the California senator Kamala Harris earlier this week. \u201cCory Booker endorsed me a number of times, and I endorsed Cory Booker a number of times,\u201d Bloomberg told CBS\u2019s Gayle King. \u201cHe\u2019s very well spoken; he\u2019s got some very good ideas. It would be better the more diverse any group is, but the public is out there picking and choosing and narrowing down this field.\u201d Bloomberg argued those who are complaining about the lack of diversity among the Democratic frontrunners should have fielded their own candidate. \u201cLots of people can enter,\u201d the former New York mayor said. \u201cIf you wanted to enter and run for president of the United States, you could have done that. But don\u2019t complain to me that you\u2019re not in the race. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d But Bloomberg\u2019s comments about Booker kicked off a round of criticism that he had promoted a racist trope that belittled the New Jersey senator\u2019s intelligence. Booker responded by saying he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s comments. \u201cMike and I have known each other for a long time,\u201d Booker told the podcast Signal Boost, adding that he has a \u201cgreat deal of regard\u201d for the former New York mayor. But Booker added: \u201cIt\u2019s sort of stunning at times that we are still revisiting these sort of tired tropes.\u201d The senator expressed hope Bloomberg would revisit the comments, but he said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that so many people still did not see what was wrong with such language. Booker also made a point to return to his concerns about the Democratic party taking black voters for granted, particularly in the wake of Harris\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cWe can\u2019t win without the enthusiastic support of black voters, and we saw that between 2016 and 2012,\u201d Booker said. Deval Patrick is the only other African American candidate in the Democratic field. Bloomberg\u2019s comments seemed to echo controversial statements made by fellow 2020 candidate Joe Biden when the former vice-president was running for the white House in 2008. At that time Biden called his then rival Barack Obama \u201carticulate and bright and clean\u201d. Biden was widely condemned for the remarks and his campaign never took off, though the spat did not prevent Obama from choosing him as his running mate and successfully winning the White House twice. Bloomberg\u2019s late entry into the race has been marred by controversy after it was revealed the eponymous news service he owns \u2013 Bloomberg News \u2013 would not investigate his campaign. He has also been criticized for a strategy of saturating the air waves with television ads, using millions of dollars of his own fortune and far out spending his more conventional rivals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
