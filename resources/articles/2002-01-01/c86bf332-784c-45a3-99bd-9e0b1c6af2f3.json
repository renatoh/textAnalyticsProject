In talks at the EU's head office, Stanislaus Mudenge said monitors will be invited, according to Hegel Goutier, a spokesman for a 77-member group of African, Caribbean and Pacific nations that co-hosted the talks. The EU wants observers in place at least six weeks before the vote and to have freedom of movement, which is in apparent conflict with a law the Zimbabwe legislature passed yesterday. Echoing worldwide concern about deteriorating human rights in Zimbabwe, the EU told Mr Mudenge to end political violence and stage fair presidential elections. Officials said that Mr Mudenge stressed the need for land reform in Zimbabwe, the issue that first sparked political violence in March 2000. Most of Zimbabwe's commercial farmland is owned by whites, who make up less than half a percent of the population. Wholesale occupations of white-owned farms have gone unpunished and president Robert Mugabe's government has curbed opposition parties and the independent press. Mr Mudenge held a 25-page speech accusing Britain, the former colonial power, of enrolling its European and North American allies in an anti-Zimbabwe campaign. \"There is grave concern that the strategy of the United Kingdom is to make promises of assistance, then mobilise international opinion through its unfair access to global media outreach and the empathy of some of its North Atlantic friends to oppose such assistance in practice,\" he said. In legislation adopted yesterday, Zimbabwean police were given sweeping new search-and-arrest powers and the right to curb monitors of the March 9-10 elections. Over the past two years, the EU has cut annual development aid to Zimbabwe because of the worsening human rights situation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
