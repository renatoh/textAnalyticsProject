He was born in Paris to an Irish actor, Ann Heffernan, and a French avant-garde poet and author, Jean-Paul de Dadelsen, who was also adviser to Jean Monnet and his European Coal and Steel Community, precursor to the European common market (EEC). The relationship was a brief one, and Michel and his mother settled in London so that she could pursue her acting career. He was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais in London, Ratcliffe college in Leicestershire and at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast. He first worked for the Prices and Incomes commission as a number cruncher and after five years moved to the Netherlands to work for the EEC\u2019s assistance programme for Africa in a similar role, rising to be deputy head of finance and personnel. He left in 1998, remaining in the Netherlands for a year as a freelance consultant before returning to the UK. In London he spent almost 15 years working for Precise Media Monitoring, responsible for translating French, Dutch and German news stories for clients until he reached retirement age in 2014. In his 20s and 30s he had served as a reservist with the British army. A gentleman with old-fashioned good manners, after retiring he worked part-time as a language exam invigilator. He was also a volunteer and fundraiser for a number of charities, was involved with several amateur dramatic societies, including the Carlton theatre group of Wimbledon, and sang in the Morley College choir in south-east London. His marriage to Christine (nee Swayne), in the early 1980s, ended in divorce a decade later. He is survived by two half-sisters, Anne and Alice, from his father\u2019s marriage to Barbara Windebank. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to clarify family details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
