More than 86,500 tickets have been sold for England\u2019s showpiece friendly against Germany at Wembley on Saturday, close to the stadium\u2019s 90,000 capacity. The attendance could beat the 80,203 who watched the 2012 women\u2019s Olympic final at Wembley between USA and Japan. At the same tournament 70,584 watched Team GB beat Brazil and in 2014 another 45,619 came to watch England lose 3-0 to Germany. The next step, for Neville, is turning those fans into regulars. \u201cThe biggest thing from this sort of circus is that these 86,000 people come back,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like they have done after the World Cup, they tuned in, they watched and thought: \u2018I want a bit of that, I want to go and see these players play.\u2019 That\u2019s what I want tomorrow and I want to come back to Wembley yearly and make it a regular occurrence.\u201d The match is also being shown live on BBC2 with commentary on Radio 5 Live. English women\u2019s football has had unprecedented projection during 2019, with 11.7m television viewers tuning in to the BBC to see England\u2019s defeat by the USA in the World Cup semi-final in Lyon. Since the World Cup the Lionesses have struggled, that defeat beginning a run of six games with only one win. But Neville said it was time his team put on a show. \u201cMy players have to inspire those young girls, like a little Ellie Roebuck [the Manchester City goalkeeper], who said something in mid-week about how being a fan at Wembley in 2014 changed her, that\u2019s what we want to do tomorrow, those 12-, 13-, 14-year-old girls that are coming tomorrow need to be inspired to put the work in and believe they can become a Lioness.\u201d Roebuck recalled her 2014 visit to the London stadium as an \u201cunbelievable occasion \u2026 It was probably one of my first memories of thinking: \u2018Wow, you could actually probably do something in the women\u2019s game now.\u2019\u201d Germany were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Women\u2019s World Cup, but are second in the global rankings, three places higher than England. England\u2019s record against Germany is poor: one win; four draws; and 20 defeats. \u201cThey have scored 31 goals in the last four games haven\u2019t they?\u201d Neville said of Germany yesterday. \u201cI thought they missed Lyon\u2019s Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n massively in the World Cup. I\u2019ve got to say, if she would have been fit like we know her then they could have easily got to the final instead of the Netherlands. \u201cThey are in a state of transition but they still maintain their spot \u2013 second in the world. They are Germans, they know what they are doing, they are consistent and that\u2019s what you will see tomorrow. You will see a team that won\u2019t fold. You will see a team that will be disciplined, a team that won\u2019t be scared of that occasion and we will have to play probably as good as we\u2019ve ever played under me to get that win tomorrow.\u201d Neville said his players were still learning what it took to be the best in the world. \u201cIn one of the [training] camps I wanted them to go to their bedrooms, and sleep for two hours \u2026 an hour later I came down and 18 players are in a room just having a laugh and a joke because they couldn\u2019t sleep. But the best form of rest and recovery is sleep. There is still that education needed.\u201d The world record attendance for any women\u2019s match is 90,125 for the 1999 World Cup final in Pasadena, California, which the USA won against China in a penalty shootout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
