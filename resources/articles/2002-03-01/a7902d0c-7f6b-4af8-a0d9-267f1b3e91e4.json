The programme, which normally gets around 2 million viewers, could muster just 2% of the audience. It took a hammering from a Coronation Street special focusing on Matt and Charlie Ramsden's unravelling marriage, which brought the ITV1 soap into a rare head to head with Brookside. The 60-minute special pulled in 11.1 million viewers and a 52% audience share between 7.30pm and 8.30pm. Brookside, which starts at 8pm, will also probably have lost viewers to Sky Sports 2, which showed live coverage of England's football friendly with Italy from 8pm. \"It's a blip. Brookside faced strong competition last night from Coronation Street and football,\" a Channel 4 spokesman said. \"This is not indicative of the current audience for the show, which usually pulls in 2 million viewers.\" Brookside was not the only show to be squeezed between Coronation Street and live football last night. BBC1's South American travel documentary Stephen Fry: in Search of the Spectacled Bear had just 2.9 million viewers and a 14% audience share between 7.30pm and 8.20pm. And after that, BBC1 drama Rockface slumped to 3.1 million viewers between 8.35pm and 9.30pm, after attracting 5 million the previous Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
