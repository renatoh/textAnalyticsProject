Just choose the complaint you think is most similar to your own. Different sections are designed to give you a wide range of useful information: How can you complain? outlines the complaints procedure - from talking to the local manager to contacting a national regulatory body. What are your grounds for complaint? explains your legal rights, the remit of the bodies involved and the type of issues you can or can't complain about. Will you get a fair hearing? reveals whether the complaints procedure is fair and independent. If the whole process is a sham, you'll want to know. What will happen if you're successful? is not just about the size of your cash payout. Some complaints may also influence how an organisation is run in future. A perfect combination of altruism and financial recompense. Anything else you can do? lets you know your other options. If you have been unsuccessful so far you'll be able to find avenues for appeal or further action. Useful links directly connects you to related websites - giving you access to useful legislation, explanatory leaflets and advice bodies. If complaints procedures differ between regions, this is indicated under separate categories for England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or other regions. Complaints procedures are constantly evolving as new legislation enacts fresh or tighter regulation of industries. London minicabs will be regulated for the first time from April 2002. The National Care Standards Commission will begin overseeing health and social care in England (also from April 2002) - including organisations previously overlooked, such as voluntary hospitals and boarding schools. The police service has recently reformed their complaints procedures, including greater powers to investigate officers. Recent legislation has also bolstered the rights of consumers and citizens. The Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force on October 2000, is an important foundation for numerous rights-based complaints, both predictable and obscure. New legislation can also produce unclear and transitory guidelines, however. Uncovering the complaints procedure for specific government policies - appealing against immigration and asylum decisions for instance - reveals a labyrinthine process muddled by inconsistent and confusing advice. MP's Surgery does your work for you. Based on information from individual organisations, government departments and internet sources, it sorts through the mire to deliver comprehensive and up-to-date advice. Your complaint has every chance of being acknowledged and redressed. There are some notable exceptions. You could try to register a complaint against the security services, but in the course of their existence, not a single complaint has been upheld against them. Cynics and paranoiacs should watch the newly instated Investigatory Powers Tribunal for further developments. There are a number of useful websites if you want further information or advice. Your first port of call should be your local citizen's advice bureau or law centre. Both will be able to inform you of your rights and possible avenues for action. To find out more about government bodies or legislation see open gov or ukonline. Other complaints sites, such as get me the manager and howtocomplain may also be useful. Complaining is not just people in restaurants who get shirty if their napkins are folded the wrong way. Making a complaint is a fundamental way of ensuring that your rights are respected and upheld. If people didn't object to error or stand up to injustice, businesses would be less consumer-friendly, and institutions - like the police, the prison service or the government - more lax in their treatment of people. MP's Surgery enables you to gain fast and effective relief from poor or unfair service. You have the tools, there is no excuse. Go forth, fellow citizens, and complain. \u0095 Additional research by Meg Clothier"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
