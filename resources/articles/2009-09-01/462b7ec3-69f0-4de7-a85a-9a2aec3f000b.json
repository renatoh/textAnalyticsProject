It was nearly sunset when we reached the spot, a sandy track edged with gorse and bramble bushes. Beyond the bite of grazing animals, the grass by the fence grew long and rank. We walked the path twice before finding our glittering prize. Low down in this mini-meadow, in a clearing barely a footstep wide, we spotted a globular body around a centimetre in diameter, ringed with brilliant, roughly drawn black, yellow and white hoops. The wasp spider sat upside down in the centre of her orb web, her long legs ringed with alternating bands of light and dark brown. Just below her head, she had scribbled a zigzag signature tag of thicker silk \u2013 the stabilimentum, whose purpose is unknown. She had also spun a dense mesh of finer thread under her feet, so that from behind the web her upturned body was harder to spot. Other species of spider lay deeper in the grass, hanging up their webs for the night. Among them sat another creature with something of Darth Vader in its looks \u2013 huge black eyes, and a helmet of a head with a dark shield-plate mantling its shoulders. At the end of her stout abdomen, this female Roesel's bush-cricket had a scimitar-like appendage, a life-giving ovipositor with a deadly appearance. Barely a metre apart in this tiny field, the predator and its prey are unwitting co-travellers in a climate change-driven migration. A generation ago, both species were confined to south-east England below the Thames. The wasp spider recently arrived here on the Cambridgeshire border. The bush cricket is already in the Midlands, leapfrogging inexorably towards Hadrian's Wall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
