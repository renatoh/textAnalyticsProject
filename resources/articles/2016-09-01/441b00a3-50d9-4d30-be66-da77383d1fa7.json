During the election campaign Joyce had announced the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority would move from Canberra to Armidale, in northern New South Wales, in the middle of his New England electorate. He made the announcement before a cost-benefit analysis of the move had been completed. His promise was criticised by hundreds of public servants who will be forced to relocate their families, and by groups such as the National Farmers Federation, Animal Medicines Australia, CropLife Australia, the Australian Capital Territory government, and ACT Liberal senator Zed Seselja. Now he is refusing to release the analysis, saying there\u2019s no need to because the decision has been made. \u201cThe cost-benefit analysis is complete and in some areas it\u2019s indeterminate, some areas it\u2019s saying it\u2019s of benefit, other areas it\u2019s saying it\u2019s marginally not of benefit,\u201d Joyce told ABC TV on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will [release it] at this stage, because the decision\u2019s been made by the Australian people.\u201d Last week Joyce had conceded the cost-benefit analysis did not support the forced relocation of the agency, telling Sky News: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to premise it on the cost-benefit analysis, we wouldn\u2019\u0080\u0099t do it.\u201d On Sunday, when asked what the point of the cost-benefit analysis was if he was not going to release it, Joyce attacked the ABC, saying an analysis of the national broadcaster would probably say to close it down. \u201cIf I did a cost-benefit analysis on public transport they\u2019d probably say it doesn\u2019t pay for itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of the processes before the election, now the election\u2019s over, a higher authority has had something to say on this, and that\u2019s the Australian people.\u201d The acting prime minister could not say how much the analysis cost taxpayers. The Greens said if the cost-benefit analysis was negative, one could only assume Joyce was relocating the agency to his own electorate for personal political reasons. \u201cRight now, it appears Mr Joyce is uprooting the lives of nearly 200 specialist staff and their families for his own political purposes,\u201d the Greens agriculture spokesperson Janet Rice said. \u201cUnless the acting prime minister releases a positive cost-benefit analysis, we can only assume that moving these families over 700km to his own electorate is pork barrelling at its most blatant. \u201cA negative cost-benefit analysis would be an unforgivable waste of taxpayer money.\u201d The relocation of the APVMA would bring 175 jobs to Joyce\u2019s seat of New England by taking them away from the ACT. He made the announcement during the election campaign when he was facing a tough battle from former independent MP Tony Windsor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
