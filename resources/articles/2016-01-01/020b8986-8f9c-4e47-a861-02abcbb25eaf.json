It was Kirk Douglas. A few days later, Laurence Olivier turned up. \u201cHe outstretched his hand for me to shake and the dog got in the way and he tripped over.\u201d Fifty-five years later, she still remembers how starstruck she felt. But besides the excitement, what Mitzi most recalls from those encounters was a feeling of frustration that she couldn\u2019t brag about it to her high-school friends. Her father, Dalton Trumbo, was one of the most famous Hollywood screenwriters of his generation, both for his work (he wrote the Oscar-winning Roman Holiday, starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, and several novels) and for his leftwing politics. In 1947, when anti-communist fear took root in America, Trumbo was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He refused to give the names of colleagues with supposedly communist sympathies and was imprisoned for 11 months. On his release, he was blacklisted and could not work under his own name. He continued to produce uncredited scripts and his three children \u2013 Nikola, Mitzi and Christopher \u2013 were told not to speak about anything that went on at home. When Mitzi opened the door to Douglas and Olivier, her father was writing the screenplay for Spartacus, which would go on to become one of the biggest box office hits of all time. Trumbo was publicly credited as its writer on the film\u2019s release in 1960: an act that effectively broke the blacklist. The extraordinary story of Trumbo\u2019s defiance in the face of politically motivated adversity has now been made into a film, with Breaking Bad\u2019s Bryan Cranston in the title role and featuring Helen Mirren and John Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s an important story to get out there,\u201d says Mitzi, 70, speaking from her home in the Bay Area of San Francisco. \u201cJay Roach [the director] and Bryan Cranston have done a wonderful job. They really care about it.\u201d Seeing her father, who died in 1976, portrayed on screen was a surreal experience. Cranston bore a startling physical resemblance to Trumbo, \u201cespecially when they had him older. At times, I would be on set and I would say: \u2018Gosh, that\u2019s so like him.\u2019 \u201d Other aspects rang less true. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene where he takes me and my sister for ice-cream,\u201d says Mitzi. \u201cI was laughing with her afterwards saying, \u2018That would never have happened!\u2019 My father worked all the time and if we had issues we went to our mum. But he was fiercely entertaining. We learned about language and politics and how to think from him. That was pretty great.\u201d The paranoia whipped up by the Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy throughout the 1950s had a devastating impact on many Americans unfairly accused of leftwing subversion. In Hollywood, more than 300 artists were boycotted by the studios. Some, such as Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles and Paul Robeson, emigrated or went underground. It was a divisive period where loyalties were questioned and friendships shattered. Trumbo, who had joined the Communist party for five years in 1943, was part of the Hollywood Ten: a group of screenwriters and directors who refused to testify and were found guilty of contempt of Congress. Other witnesses called in front of the committee \u2013 including Elia Kazan, the director of On The Waterfront \u2013 named names and were allowed to continue their work. The playwright Arthur Miller, who had been lifelong friends with Kazan, never spoke to him again. When Kazan received an honorary Oscar in 1999, many in the audience refused to clap. Mitzi remembers her father being \u201cpretty stoic\u201d about his blacklisting. \u201cHe just knew he had to figure out what to do. I have to say, honestly, communism was not very important to him \u2026 He hated meetings. He was really an independent thinker and group activities were not his sort of thing. It was the principle of democracy he was fighting for, for justice and civil rights and all those things. Having all of that around you is a good way to grow up.\u201d After he was released from jail, the Trumbo family escaped the increasingly uncomfortable political climate in America by moving to Mexico City for two years. Mitzi was six and had to learn a new language: \u201cIt was a big turnaround.\u201d She credits her mother, Cleo, with \u201ckeeping us all together. She was the rock of our family.\u201d When Mitzi was eight, the Trumbos returned to the Highland Park area of Los Angeles. \u201cYou knew you were different from everyone in the neighbourhood. There were many things you could never say or talk about. We could never talk about what our father was writing, even though our parents were very open with us.\u201d During this time Trumbo wrote The Brave One (1956), which received an Oscar for best story credited to \u201cRobert Rich\u201d \u2013 a name borrowed from a nephew of the producers. His earnings dwindled: over a two-year period, Trumbo wrote 18 screenplays at an average fee of $1,750 each. At school, Mitzi felt like an outsider. \u201cAt some point, they started having secret PTA meetings excluding my mother,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the kids started avoiding me. It was a tough few months until I finally told my parents and said \u2018I just can\u2019t go back\u2019. The kids tortured me for the rest of the year and then I went to a different school.\u201d The effect of the blacklist on families is often overlooked. In most cases, it meant that the main breadwinner was, at best, facing a substantial cut in salary and, at worst, unable to work at all. And then there was the added pressure of carrying around a notorious surname linked with communist sympathies in an era of heightened popular anxiety about the threat from Russia. \u201cWhen you said your name in the 50s, it was almost like a challenge,\u201d says Mitzi. \u201cOver the years it changed. Now, I get \u2018Oh, are you related to Dalton Trumbo?\u2019 \u201d She says that as a result she has a special bond with the other children of blacklisted artists, particularly the family of Ring Lardner Jr, who was also part of the Hollywood Ten and who went on to write M*A*S*H. \u201cThere is a community,\u201d she says. \u201cThere always is a feeling, even if we don\u2019t see them often or know them well, that we know what we went through.\u201d When McCarthy died in 1957, Mitzi remembers \u201ca sense of joy because he represented the whole thing\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t until the 1960 release of Spartacus, directed by Stanley Kubrick, and Exodus, directed by Otto Preminger, that Trumbo was given public credit for his work on both films. The blacklist rapidly lost credibility. Mitzi remembers her parents taking her and a friend to a \u201cfancy Hollywood [movie] theatre\u201d on the day Spartacus was released. \u201cIt was the first time I saw his name on screen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was amazing. It was very cool.\u201d Was her father emotional? \u201cNo, but he didn\u2019t show emotions much. He was fierce and angry about the blacklist and when it was finally broken for him, it wasn\u2019t broken for his friends. There wasn\u2019t a feeling of \u2018Oh, now it\u2019s over\u2019 because it still wasn\u2019t for lots of people.\u201d Trumbo\u2019s career survived and flourished. He was reinstated in the Writers Guild of America, and was credited on all subsequent scripts. In 1975, a year before he died, he was officially recognised as the rightful winner of the Oscar for The Brave One and was presented with a statuette. Mitzi went on to become a professional photographer. She and her husband Richard have two daughters and two grandchildren. As for the blacklist? It\u2019s in the past. \u201cHolding grudges so many years later? My parents taught us not to do that.\u201d Trumbo is being released in the UK on 5 February. THE MCCARTHY ERA \u25a0 Between 1946 and 1952, the number of FBI agents rose from 3,559 to 7,029, as part of President Truman\u2019s loyalty-security programme, which investigated government employees to identify communist sympathisers. \u25a0 In October 1947, the House Committee on Un-American Activities (Huac) began to subpoena screenwriters and directors to testify about alleged communist links. \u25a0 The Hollywood Ten, a group of actors, screenwriters and directors who refused to answer some questions posed by the committee, were blacklisted by studios. \u25a0 Eventually, hundreds of artists were banned by the industry. Among them were Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles and Paul Robeson. \u25a0 Senator Joe McCarthy launched his anti-communist campaign in 1950, when he accused more than 200 state department staff of being communists. \u25a0 By 1959, Huac was being denounced by former presidentTruman as the \u201cmost un-American thing in the country today\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
