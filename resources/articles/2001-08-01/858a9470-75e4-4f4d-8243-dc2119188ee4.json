Wisely, perhaps, he elects not to take the temperature inside the Astoria, which is so cramped and overheated that by 8.45pm - 90 dehydrated, airless minutes before the headliners appear on stage - the debilitated and faint are being led to sanctuary. Why a stoic, wonderfully good-natured crowd should put themselves through such discomfort is down to a diminutive, grey-bearded 56-year-old from Jamaica's north coast. A recording artist since 1969, Winston Rodney - his Burning Spear appellation is a homage to Kenya's first president Jomo Kenyatta - is an unassuming figure in his once-white T-shirt and scruffy jeans. However, his understated dignity and the joyous nature of his wares overcome a muddy sound, the inevitable marijuana fog and, almost, the conditions. Although hitless and destined to remain so, two glorious compilations, Reggae Greats and Spear Burning, have reintroduced Rodney to a new generation keen to hear reggae without hip-hop, DJ or dancehall inflections. Moreover, Rodney's latest threat to retire is given unusual credence by the fact that his once-plaintive voice is a waning force these days. His music is impossible to dislike: straightforward (but rarely simple) roots reggae, with regular invocations of rastafari, condemnations of \"Babylon\" and, hearteningly, no notion that the world has moved on since Ken Boothe and Rupie Edwards graced the British charts. Rodney is mesmerising as he glides serenely over Travelling - a song that inspired 2-Tone's entire output - before skipping across stage and embarking upon a spry bongos solo. He is not one for banter, other than to demand, \"Do you want some more?\" during each song. Behind him, a tightly drilled band follows his every unpredictable nuance - the mischievous old goat in Rodney, you suspect, rather enjoys keeping them on their toes - and the guitar solo that climaxes The Invasion would not have been out of place on a Spin Doctors album. Despite the sauna, the crowd adore the little man. They sway along to Jah No Dead, with its layers of keyboards competing against both brass section and floor-quaking bass. They sing along lustily to Black Disciples and, rivers of perspiration cascading down their backs, spend all evening wondering just how Rodney - under lights and leather pill-box hat - manages not to sweat. Now that is star quality. \u0095 Burning Spear plays the Buttermarket Jazz and Roots Club, Shrewsbury (01743 231142), tonight, then tours."}, "isHosted": false}}}
