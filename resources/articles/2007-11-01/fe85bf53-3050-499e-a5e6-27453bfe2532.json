A survey by the Guardian, along with emissions figures supplied to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) by 1,300 of the world's corporations, also found that 68 of the FTSE 100 companies quoted on the London stock exchange have taken action to assess the amount of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent, that they release into the atmosphere. A further 18 Footsie companies reported their figures but asked that they be kept confidential, while three more gave some information but didn't include their emissions figures or reported them only partially. Eleven companies that failed to supply the CDP with figures were contacted by the Guardian and asked once more if they would contribute this valuable information for our survey, but they either declined or were unable to do so. The costs for those 100 companies to convert to a low-carbon economy at projected prices on the European carbon trading market is \u00a316.3bn, while the social costs \u2014 according to estimates by the Treasury \u2014 would be around \u00a348bn. Launching the CDP's entire report in New York in late September, former US president Bill Clinton emphasised the importance of \"keeping score\" if the battle to mitigate and adapt to climate change is to be won. \"I think climate change poses an existential challenge to the world,\" he said. \"We have to be willing to keep score and then we have to think of ways to ...make this helpful both in developed and developing countries. Because, make no mistake about it, the general consensus is that we have got to cut greenhouse gas emissions 60% by 2050.\" For many companies this score-keeping is new and not fully understood. Often the mechanisms for capturing relevant data are not yet in place or else analysts are working to different standards. Methodology Our table shows two groups working with varying methods. The first group reported according to the internationally accepted greenhouse gas protocol, while the second reported mainly to an earlier standard from Defra, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. The emissions data in our table and those collected on a wider scale by the CDP is still only a beginning. The direct emissions measured are those generated by an organisation, while the indirect only take account of those caused by purchased electricity, heat, or steam. A third level of all other indirect emissions has yet to be added \u2014 everything involved in the rest of the supply chain including transport, waste disposal and the extraction or production of materials. An agreement on how to measure these and avoiding double-counting is due to be hammered out at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January next year. The CDP is providing the secretariat for a group of international standards bodies, which include the major accounting firms KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Ernst and Young. The CDP has begun measuring Wal-Mart's supply chain in the US. \"This partnership is a significant milestone in corporate action to mitigate climate change,\" says Paul Dickinson, the chief executive of the CDP (see page 31). Here in the UK, a similar project was launched last month in the supply chains of Tesco, Unilever, Cadbury Schweppes, Imperial Tobacco, Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle. At the London launch of this year's CDP report last month, Tesco chief Sir Terry Leahy said, \"Too few organisations, governments and companies are alert to the challenge climate change poses.\" However, 77% of FTSE 500 companies responded to this year's request for information from the CDP compared with 72% last year and just 47% in 2002. Responding, though, does not necessarily mean supplying all the relevant figures or information. Cost assessment Our survey also attempts to assess the cost of a cleanup both to the companies involved and to society generally. The figures are only indicative but give some idea of the scale of the task we are facing. The cost attributed to each business in our table assumes that it trades away its carbon emissions on the fledgling EU market. Costs there rose at one point to \u20ac30 a tonne before crashing, when it was revealed that the national allocations given out in 2005 had been far too generous. However, Deutsche Bank has estimated that the new phase of the scheme, which starts next year, will see the price settle at \u20ac35 a tonne and that is the figure we have used. Of course the change to a low carbon economy won't happen like this or in such an immediate way. Carbon trading and offsetting are the least favoured options in a world where technological innovation and a complete rethink of our economic activity will have to take place. Climate change minister Joan Ruddock said at the London launch of the CDP survey that adaptation would involve \"the biggest restructuring of how we live and work since the industrial revolution.\" The Stern review estimated that acting forcefully on climate change now would cost around \u00a3184bn, or 1% of global GDP, but by 2050 the cost will have risen to anything between 5% and 20%. There is an even greater cost than that to be met by individual companies. The Treasury estimates that the social cost of climate change \u2014 its impact on health, agriculture, wildlife, and the consequences of sea level rise and extreme weather \u2014 is \u00a370 a tonne and rising by \u00a31 a tonne every year that no action is taken. Our table shows that the social cost associated with the 68 companies that revealed their figures is \u00a332.8bn. That rises to some \u00a348bn if all of the FTSE 100 is included."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
