If you are a big charity, these are not for you. But if you are a registered charity with turnover of less than \u00a31.5m, read on. Smaller charities tend to be overshadowed by the big players of the voluntary sector. Yet in terms of innovation, flexibility and reach into communities, it\u2019s very often the case that small is beautiful. The Guardian Charity Awards seek to redress that. For 23 years, we have showcased excellence among small and medium-sized charities and given a much-needed boost to organisations struggling to get the profile and funding they need to move forward. Our entry criteria mean that the big names cannot exert their usual dominance. The awards offer a priceless leg-up to organisations that are delivering practical solutions to present-day problems, never more important than at a time of continuing austerity in our public services. Last year\u2019s winners were: A&amp;M Training, a personal and community development charity specialising in the delivery of diversionary group work and physical activities for young people aged 7- 25 in Glasgow. Sky Badger is a charity that finds help and adventure for disabled children and their families. The Back-Up Trust focuses on the psychological impact of spinal cord injury. The Personal Support Unit is an effective and expanding charity currently operating in 10 civil and family court centres across England and Wales. UK Network of Sex Work Projects, a pioneering and innovative project which provides greater access to justice and protection for sex workers. As long as the objective of your charity is improving social wellbeing in the UK in its broadest sense, and provided other entry criteria are met, nothing is ruled out. Will you rule yourself in?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
