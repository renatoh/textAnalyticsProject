Like the same composer's Amadis and Armide , also to libretti by Philippe Quinault, Roland is a duty versus love saga taken from Ariosto and based on medieval legends of chivalry. Never before recorded in its entirety, the work's dramatic unity and seriousness of purpose show through in this fine performance from Lausanne Opera House, with superb French soloists wringing every last drop of emotional lyricism. At the helm of his accomplished Les Talens Lyriques, Christophe Rousset conducts with his trademark panache."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
