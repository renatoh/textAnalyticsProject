Birch\u2019s other novels \u2013 Blood (2011) and Ghost River (2015), both acclaimed \u2013 also read like they were written with ease, so commanding is the authorial voice; so linear of plot, and authentic of character and emotional resonance. But The White Girl, Birch says, came still faster and easier. Birch says he\u2019s most pleased with this latest, as we sit in Mario\u2019s, a cafe that is as quintessentially Fitzroy as Birch. At 62, the novelist is also a short story-writer, poet, academic historian, climate justice-Indigenous rights activist who grew up in inner-city Melbourne with a rich Aboriginal, Barbadian (convict), Irish and Afghani heritage. \u201cTo me it\u2019s the most balanced [novel]. And this is going to frighten some people \u2013 I literally wrote the first draft in about two months,\u201d he says. The White Girl is a black and white story about Australian colonialism\u2019s malevolent legacies, and the courage, strength and dignity of Indigenous resistance. It\u2019s a story about strong women, with whom Birch\u2019s life has been blessed. It is also a profound allegory of good and evil, and a deep exploration of human interaction, black and white, alternately beautiful and tender, cruel and unsettling. The plot begins in the 1960s in fictitious Deane, a country town whose physical, historic and bureaucratic character might place it in southern Queensland, north-western New South Wales or Victoria, where Aboriginal people were at the whim of \u201cprotectors\u201d, be they police or missions, and from whom they required permission for most freedoms, including travel. But Deane, a dying colonial town on a drying river whose waters have been stolen for whitefella agriculture, has national resonance \u2013 just like racist colonial legacies. Deane is anywhere. Deane is everywhere. The story revolves around Aboriginal Odette Brown, a Deane resident since childhood who cares for Sissy, a granddaughter conceived in rape by a white pastoralist, Joe Kane, for whom Odette once worked as a domestic. Odette\u2019s daughter, Lila, traumatised by her violation and unable to cope with life as a mother, fled to the big city, leaving behind Sissy, the white girl of Birch\u2019s title. It\u2019s a multiple quest. First, to the city for a desired reconciliation between Odette, Lila and Sissy so as to prevent the new town cop, Sergeant Lowe \u2013 state-custodian of all Aboriginal people in his district \u2013 from taking (white) Sissy from her (black) grandma carer. Second, to mete out some sort of natural justice to the Kanes, whose colonial pioneering dream settlement has descended into decrepitude, depravity and poverty. Other characters about Deane embody the varying sympathies of non-Indigenous Australians to the Aboriginal postcolonial plight. We have the retiring alcoholic copper Bill Shea, whose story becomes the tragedy of inaction. Birch also gives us junkyard owner Henry Lamb (a name can evoke so much that dozens of pages can\u2019t) who became \u201ctouched\u201d after a knock on the head as a kid, found himself befriended by the Indigenous kids and endured a lifetime of ostracism \u2013 and gained more emotional intelligence than Deane\u2019s collected white populace. \u201cI wanted to write a character who ... is intellectually challenged in some ways, but I hope I didn\u2019t write him in a patronising way,\u201d Birch says. \u201cHe\u2019s much more emotionally intelligent than most people around him.\u201d Henry and the Kanes clash, their resolution a deft dramatic crescendo of The White Girl. There is also a Jewish town doctor possessed of natural empathy towards Odette, and old Millie Khan: Odette\u2019s lifelong Aboriginal friend who is also married to a Muslim Afghan cameleer. Birch\u2019s great grandfather on his mother\u2019s side was an Afghani, Bouta Khan, from the Punjab. \u201cHe came to Australia in the 1890s, and he had to go through the terrible process of getting an exemption from the Immigration Act [under the white Australia policies] in the 20th century so that he could take my grandmother back to the Punjab so she could meet his family ... there were three of those families who settled in Fitzroy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had their own mosque which ran out of a terrace house. And they were really great people. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt for that man because he was a really devout non-drinker, hard-worker, never been in trouble with the police and yet he had to go through the humiliation of getting an exemption.\u201d I\u2019ve met novelists who ponder if their ancestries and life experiences are sufficiently \u201cinteresting\u201d to adequately serve their creativity. Birch could never be among them. Expelled for the second time in a year, he left school early: \u201cAt the age of 15 I began a \u2018career\u2019 riding a pushbike as a telegram boy.\u201d Birch later spent a decade as a firefighter. He went to the University of Melbourne, as a mature-age student, at 30. In 2003 he was awarded the Chancellor\u2019s Medal for the best PhD in Arts. He is now the Bruce McGuinness research fellow at Victoria University, where he applies skills as a writer to climate change research and to advancing justice for those most impacted by it: Indigenous communities and people on society\u2019s margins. Birch is a writer with a profound gift for language and human insight. He writes with razor\u2019s edge emotional clarity and empathy about people and place \u2013 especially on those Australian margins, rural and urban. The White Girl showcases his gift. He\u2019s a knockabout bloke who, despite diminutive height, exudes a formidable physical presence and has something about him of the featherweight boxer \u2013 not surprising, perhaps, given his fighting antecedents. Birch\u2019s great grandfather was James \u201cPrince\u201d Moodie, transported from Barbados to Tasmania. \u201cHis crime, for which he was transported for 14 years, was listed as \u2018disobedience\u2019 \u2013 of which I\u2019m proud,\u201d Birch says. James Moodie\u2019s descendants included Les Moodie, a lightweight who often pursued more lucrative boxing prizes in Sydney where, Birch says, he was subject to extreme racism and announced as \u201cthe coffee-coloured coon from Melbourne\u201d. The White Girl is a novel with national Indigenous themes: colonial oppression, dispossession, the stolen generations, generational violence against Aboriginal people. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an Aboriginal person who doesn\u2019t have a story of that sort of loss [through the stolen generations] somewhere in their family. No Aboriginal person I know is completely intact because of that \u2026 Everyone is missing someone, and someone in that family has got to carry that repository of memory,\u201d he says. It was also always going to be a book about strong black women, he says. \u201cI knew at the outset that I was going to write a novel that could reach Aboriginal women. Again, for all the family experience and all the material I\u2019d read in the public records office and what I\u2019d heard from other people, I was determined to write a really strong, central female character. And really to celebrate the courage and heroics of Aboriginal women,\u201d he says. Birch is unsure if his novel, for all the historical weight he has managed to weave so lightly into the narrative, will dispel the ignorance, much of it wilful, that still characterises Australia\u2019s refusal to process such a dark, violent past. \u201cI think there\u2019s this continuum cycle of push-pull around what we might call enlightenment. And I think what happens in colonial societies is that we never get to move into a postcolonial state of being \u2026 and we can\u2019t until we have a much longer period of contemplation, of ethical thinking, of dignified relationships across different divides,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of this book. But I\u2019m not confident that any book or piece of art has the ability to fundamentally shift many people. When people, for example, talk about climate change and the role of writers and artists \u2013 I believe in that. But if people ask, \u2018Do we write more climate change fiction?\u2019 I say, \u2018No \u2013 we fucking get down on the picket line\u2019.\u201d \u2022 The White Girl by Tony Birch is out now through UQP"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
