As of last Sunday, Italy's footballers have hung up their stockings on the wall and settled down to a hearty three-week break. Thanks to Papal influence and campaigning from the Italian Players' Association, Serie A won't be back in full swing till the 12th of January. Nice work if you can get it. The final round of 2002 though has left things seasonably tight, so with 15 down and 19 to go, here's how they're looking: leaders Milan have been caught on top by neighbours Inter, after Sunday's 0-0 draw at home to Roberto Baggio's Brescia. The result is bad news for the President's men: the last thing they wanted was everyone to see just how quickly man to man midfield marking jams their game up. And With prized strikers Andriy Shevchenko and SuperPippo Inzaghi treading on each others very valuable toes up front, Cuddly coach Carlo Ancelotti has some re-thinking to do over the Yule break. Still, it's the first time since 1995 that Milan welcome Santa in first place, so no one's panicking yet. Inter, meanwhile, have moved up after a win away to Parma, a town that had previously reserved them nothing but hard cheese. Inter had lost eight and drawn four of their previous 12 visits and frankly, this weekend's encounter looked anything but auspicious: Inter were without Hernan Crespo, Christian Vieri and Mohammed Kallon, and the only fit strikers on their books - Adrian Mutu and Adriano - were away playing on loan at, er, Parma. Still, no doubt galvanised by Inter's Christmas gift to the squad of a laptop each, the nerazzurri knuckled down with a decent performance - and their first ever win here in the 12 years since Parma first won promotion. Worryingly for their rivals, by the time the league starts up again they'll have Vieri and Crespo back. What kind of Lazio will we see come the New Year? The Roman side go into the break a point off behind the two Milanese clubs in third, following Sunday's home draw with Bologna. This was a match that marked the final appearance for Sergio Cragnotti as Lazio's president, and as Vincent Van Gogh's girlfriend observed on opening the morning post, it's the end of an era. Cragnotti was the man who won Paul Gascoigne from Tottenham. Cragnotti was also the man who made a winner out of Sven-Goran Eriksson. Lazio's fans may have never forgiven him his 'football is business' mentality (indeed they saluted him Sunday with a barrage of whistles) but in the 11 years that Mr C was paying the bills, Lazio were successful as never before - six trophies, and the all-important Italian Championship. Of course it now turns out it wasn't Cragnotti's money anyway; his Cirio company are chronically in debt and haven't paid his players since the summer. The team have now begun legal action to reclaim their salaries - if they're still unpaid after 20 days, they can walk. The club's only hope of stopping this appears to be selling off 1or two names (say, Darko Stankovic or Jaap Stam) come the January transfer window. It'd be a shame - Lazio's extraordinary run deserves a better end. At least there's always Roma to cheer the Laziali up. Rome's other team managed a win this weekend (against Torino) but they still lie 10 points off the action at the top and are looking royally screwed in Europe too. Word is Manager Fabio Capello will be off come summer. If he's going to leave the former champions in Europe he's got work to do - Sunday's game saw them outplayed by one of Serie A's worst sides, and even with the three points they still lag behind Udinese in 8th. Look to the future now and all that, but as for Juventus, who knows? 2002's most successful side broke their four-game winless streak on Sunday, but in unimpressive fashion: it took an injury time strike by Mauro Camoranesi to snatch three points from the unfortunate Perugia (curiously the Argentine winger is being eyed-up by Italy's scouts for a possible Zola Budd style international call-up). On this showing, Juve don't look bound for glory. Currently they're lying fifth, behind the ever-amazing Chievo on goal difference. Juve don't have the flair or depth of either of the teams leading, but they do have David Trezeguet returning to fitness at last. Above all, they're the club that's won over a quarter of all Italian championships ever played - you'd be foolish to count them out. See you next year - and Buone feste!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
