We are invited to follow three horses over the course of a year: small but plucky Ardalan, potential world-beater Joncol, and the distinctly troubled Cuan na Gra\u00ed. It's to director Liz Mermin's credit that each horse emerges as a distinct personality (though the fractured bit of music that signals Cuan na Gra\u00ed's every appearance gets a tad grating after a while). The tenor of a working racehorse's life is skilfully evoked, and you can't help but feel for Nolan as he tries to strategise his way through the racing season. Mermin's film is a pleasure to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
