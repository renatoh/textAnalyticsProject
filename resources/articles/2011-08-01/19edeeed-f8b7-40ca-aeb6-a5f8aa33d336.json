The pint-sized magician got a black eye after he was hit by a flying pizza while filming a bit of slapstick fun for ITV's Sooty Show. Apparently, after the first take Daniels had complained that the pizza hadn't been thrown hard enough, but on the second he got more than he bargained for.

The tweet @DuncanBannatyne Things got sinister on Twitter as the entrepreneur and no-nonsense Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne took on a Russian blackmailer. Bannatyne initially offered \u00a325,000 to anyone who could track down the tweeter who threatened to harm his daughter, with the reward going up to \u00a350,000 if his arms were broken. Bannatyne later changed his offer to a more considered \"\u00a330,000 reward for info leading to his arrest\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
