Miss! It was the day of the Christmas fete. \"Come and spend all your money on my form's stall,\" she ordered. \"We must beat 1G's takings or die in the attempt.\" Apparently there was an Own-Clothes Day on offer to the class raising the most money for the school on-site Family Planning Clinic fund, or whatever this year's most pressing need has been determined to be. But, in fact, as I informed Miss! as best I could as she fended off a crowd of hyperactive first years deafening her with questions about the top price the home-made mince-pie market would bear, I do not require to be compelled to attend the fete but rather have it as one of the most hotly anticipated events in my social calendar. \"In fact,\" I added, \"I will go further. I will say I attend more willingly the older I get. The joys of the school Christmas fete do not dim but rather are polished to a higher shine by the passage of time, gleaming yet more brightly amid the accumulated dreariness and bleak drudgery of one's adult years, don't you find?\" \"No,\" said Miss! \"But then, I've been up since five making a sodding money tree, so just come and buy all the tickets so I can go home, would you, please?\" A piercing scream rose above the feverish background noise. \"And bring some bandages. Someone's just wedged her head in the tombola drum. I bet it's Rochelle.\" The fete (which was actually this year a fayre, or fair, depending on the orthographic confidence of the various banner-makers) was a resounding success. Enough traditional stalls survived to satisfy the reactionary element: broken-backed books, hand-made cards, bric-a-brac you wouldn't give a dog to chew and, of course, the tombola, staffed by Rochelle (missing an ear, but smiling still), offering the chance to spend 50p trying to win a 30p tube of Smarties. I declined, on the grounds that while I was happy to support the event, nobody likes being taken for a mug. \"You could win a mug instead,\" suggested Rochelle. \"Over there.\" \"That's 1G's stall, you blithering fool!\" snarled Miss! \"Do that again and I'll fail you on your SATs.\" But there were innovations. Pupils walked around selling popcorn and raffle tickets from usherette trays, or ran individual stalls offering henna tattoos, hand massages, manicures and hair braiding, bespeaking the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that I suspect will culminate soon in a management buyout of the PTA. I bought some hand-made bead jewellery as Christmas presents for people I don't like very much, a lavender pincushion embroidered with the words \"Because you are so nearly dead\" for my great-aunt, some decorated boxes to put everything in, and had a go on the money tree. I spent a pound and got a total of 10 pence in coppers back. \"I co-authored the pre-Budget report,\" said Miss! with a mirthless laugh, and slipped the rest into a box marked Trident. As consolation, I treated myself to a 60p manicure, and I must say that the tiny 11-year-old girl who hunched over my fingernails with such care and concentration did an absolutely rubbish job. \"It's all right,\" I said, as she started to cry. \"It's my fault. I shouldn't have been greedy - I came here to restore my spirit, not my body. I'll only take 20p back. Merry Christmas.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
