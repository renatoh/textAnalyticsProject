Current protection for bondholders, who lent banks billions of pounds in the run-up to the crisis, will be abolished by regulators as part of wide-ranging reforms to the financial sector, Tamara Burnell, a senior credit analyst at the bond fund manager M&amp;G Investments, has warned. The measures could result in bondholders accepting steep cuts in the value of their holdings when a bank gets into trouble. Burnell said bondholders would share the pain of restructuring a bank alongside equity shareholders, who face a cut in the value of their stock market holdings. Until now, governments have sought to protect bondholders when financial institutions go bust, despite equity holders often losing all their investment and taxpayers suffering losses, at least in the short term. In 2008, several banks in Europe and the US were rescued by injections of taxpayer funds, while monthly payments to bondholders were maintained. In the UK alone, \u00a375bn was spent on bailing out Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland. But under new rules, governments are likely to back mechanisms that force bondholders to support banks before they need to be rescued by the taxpayer. Burnell said: \"Regulators and politicians around the world continue to demand that, next time around, bondholders are the capital providers of last resort, rather than the taxpayer, and to this end regulators have been tasked with coming up with 'resolution regimes' for global banks. \"As we see in corporate restructurings, debtholders usually have to recapitalise a company to maximise their recoveries \u2013 via a debt-for-equity swap or some sort of debt forgiveness \u2013 and a similar restructuring process is now being proposed for banks.\" She added: \"Ultimately these changes will lead to bond investors being far more careful about which banks they lend to, which could force a painful contraction in bank balance sheets.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
