Today is Lawrence Dallaglio's 35th birthday and Catt himself will be 36 next month. Also starting against France tomorrow will be the 35-year-old Mark Regan. Collectively, the trio are even more ancient than Twickenham, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary as the home of English rugby this week. Yet before the Dad's Army jibes inevitably resurface in France, Catt has news for anyone who assumes that the old boys are past their sell-by dates. He may be the oldest back to lead England since the war, having started his career alongside such long-retired names as Rory Underwood, Dean Richards and the former captain Will Carling, but experience has convinced him that age is irrelevant. He also believes you can still teach an old Catt new tricks. His confidence is partly based on the brutal fitness regime England have been undergoing over the past six weeks. Having been out on exercise with the Royal Marines and sweated buckets during a training camp in Portugal, a number of players look fitter than they have done for a long time. \"I probably wouldn't have thought I would be involved in this World Cup,\" he admitted yesterday. \"But I don't feel 36 and I'm doing everything the young guys are doing. I'll be very disappointed at the World Cup if, physically, I'm not up to it.\" Dallaglio was similarly bullish earlier this week, content that his efforts as a replacement against Wales last week had banished any fitness doubts following his return from minor knee surgery. The England head coach Brian Ashton, according to Catt, has not singled anyone out for preferential treatment, in contrast to the last World Cup in 2003, when the centre was recalled at the 11th hour, having spent \"five weeks in Spain on the piss\" while his colleagues flogged themselves in the gym. \"Myself, Lawrence and Vicks [Phil Vickery] have just put our heads down and boshed on,\" revealed Catt, who is allowed to train sparingly during the domestic season by his club London Irish. \"There are no special people in this squad. I've actually felt better the more work I've done.\" With a new close-shaven haircut and a transparent desire to make an impact in his fourth World Cup, Catt's optimism could not be more of a contrast from his latter days at Bath, when he alleges that mistreatment of a persistent lower back problem almost cost him his career. \"If I'd stayed at Bath, I'd have had to finish,\" he says bluntly. His move to London Irish has been a blessing and he is determined to secure a final World Cup hurrah by steering England to a morale-boosting victory over Les Bleus tomorrow. For that to happen, players of all vintages will be expected to make an impact. Catt is a huge fan of the new, young full-back Nick Abendanon - \"He's a mega-talent\" - and will do his best to assist Olly Barkley, who will be starting at No10 for England for only the second time since March 2004. Even so, his own ambitions burn just as brightly. \"I'm not there to nurse anybody,\" Catt warned, aware that he occupies one of the more hotly contested positions in Ashton's squad. \"I don't think any of us take our places for granted.\" If anyone can roll back the years in a sport increasingly populated by the under-30 brigade, Catt, Dallaglio and Regan are surely the men. However, Dallaglio and Regan operate in the area that presents England with their only concern against France, which the forwards coach, John Wells, reiterated yesterday. It is the likelihood that Bernard Laporte's side will offer a much stiffer forward test than Wales did during last Saturday's 62-5 thrashing. \"This week, I suspect things up front will be very different,\" said Wells, unruffled by criticism from South Africa's coach, Jake White, about his side's rucking technique. \"I'm delighted that we've got international coaches around the world picking on us. It's the first time that's happened for 15 months, so we've obviously rattled a few cages.\" The defence coach, Mike Ford, reckons England can also disrupt France's preparations. \"If you can frustrate the French you can be successful against them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
