Steve Field, the super-bright, straight-talking director of communications at the Treasury, will take over from Simon Lewis as the prime minister's official spokesman on an interim basis. A civil service high-flier, he was previously head of the Treasury's European economic reform team. One of the job's primary tasks is to conduct regular lobby briefings with journalists. As head of the team of civil service press officers, however, he is supposed to maintain political impartiality and is distinct from Conservative spin doctors and other appointees. Lewis, who was appointed official spokesman to Gordon Brown last summer, is to become strategic communications adviser to UK Trade and Investment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
