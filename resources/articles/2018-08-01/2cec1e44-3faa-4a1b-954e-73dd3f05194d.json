Top stories The race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, has offered a blistering assessment of contemporary Australian politics, warning in his farewell speech that \u201crace politics is back\u201d and expressing his disbelief that \u201cthe biggest threats to racial harmony\u201d come from \u201cwithin our parliaments and from sections of our media\u201d.

More than seven in 10 Australians want the government to set a high renewable energy target, a poll has found, with a desire to put downward pressure on power prices the motivating factor. On Friday the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, will meet state and territory ministers to discuss the national energy guarantee, which imposes reliability and emissions reduction obligations on power retailers from 2020.

Amateur stargazers create crowdsourced star maps; gamers with spare CPU capacity link up in mass computing events that model the way protein strands work; and CSIRO is calling on householders to track their energy use.
