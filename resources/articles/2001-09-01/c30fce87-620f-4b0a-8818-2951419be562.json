When they emerged in 1998, the McNamara brothers talked of their band toppling Oasis by emulating the mercurial angst of Nick Drake and Jeff Buckley. Noel Gallagher was not impressed (he advised singer Danny to \"get some singing lessons\"), but the Yorkshire band certainly had a go, producing a clutch of hits with Gallagher-sized choruses, together with several painstakingly fragile ballads. Nowadays, Embrace are bigger than Oasis, but only in sound. If You've Never Been, their third album in three years, is enormously orchestrated, although some critics have speculated as to the whereabouts of the tunes. It's being promoted by a string of secret gigs at stately homes and manors, with loyal fans buying their tickets via the band's website (www.embrace.co.uk). Leeds Town Hall is a magnificent venue and home to several classical orchestras, but the number of rock bands who have played here in recent years can be counted on one hand. Nobody has wondered why. As Embrace limber up for their epic homecoming, what begins as a bold adventure immediately descends into grand folly. The sound is awful, transforming Embrace's everything-bar-the-kitchen sink productions into what might as well be very bad bootlegs being played at high volume in a wind tunnel. If not something worse than that. Only two songs, All You Good, Good People and newie Make It Last, escape the sonic mauling. The spectacle - the architecture, fairy lights, video screens, and the hall's enormous piped organ - is quite something, but Embrace are so determined to make this an event that they end up making a spectacle of themselves. We're treated to live videos of the band before the band comes on, a two-hour set (even Bruce Springsteen, with a 30-year career behind him, only does two and a half), and barely audible speeches about \"soul\". Once, Embrace's soul produced songs such as the unutterably lovely Fireworks, but now their epic egomania results in a succession of bizarre Spinal Tap moments. Danny McNamara judges an onstage competition with fans in fancy dress, including a girl dressed as a sunflower, while the always suspect Save Me degenerates into tuneless prog-rock bluster. Naked ambition is one thing, but when it's this bare, it really should go home and put some clothes on."}, "isHosted": false}}}
