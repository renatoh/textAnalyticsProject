Initially, she would tell me, like the occasion she told a friend about a medical condition I have. I've expressed my unhappiness about this, but now she continues to do it covertly. When times have been difficult between us I've found text messages to friends saying how egocentric and selfish I am. That's quite a fair description of my behaviour at one time, but surely this should be something between us? Now she's locked her phone and changed her all her online passwords. She says that her friends will not judge me even though I've explained that, for me, it feels like she is having an affair. We're getting nowhere. How can I get her to understand that a relationship should have privacy and boundaries, or should I simply accept that she has a need to share her feelings about me with her friends? \u2022 This article was launched in error with last week's question as the headline.
