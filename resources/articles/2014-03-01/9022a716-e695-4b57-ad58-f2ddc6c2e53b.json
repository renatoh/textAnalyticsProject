Abbott referred to the Greens as \u201cthe devil\u201d, lectured that \u201cyou intelligently make the most of the good things God has given us\u201d and laboured his key message, a steal from Genesis, that \u201cthe environment is meant for man\u201d. His audience was the cream of the industry which has marauded the nation\u2019s forests since industrialised logging for woodchip exports to Japanese and Chinese paper mills began in 1970. Abbott said \u201cI don\u2019t see people who are environmental bandits, I see people who are the ultimate conservationists ... I salute you.\u201d So clear-fall logging and burning of the tallest flowering forests on the planet, with provision for the dynamiting of trees over 80 metres tall, is an ultimate good in Abbott\u2019s book of ecological wisdom. Abbott began with a homily to his shipwright grandfather and a story about how, as a schoolboy, he paddled his timber canoe in Sydney Harbour\u2019s Lane Cove National Park. But the boy who bypassed industrial foreshores to find a local forest for his own special experience has become a prime minister with no worries about issuing a death warrant against distant pristine forests which he has never seen. There is a parallel here with his easy ability to lock up desperate, warm-hearted but unfamiliar human beings in the murderous conditions of Manus Island. They are secondary to his own progress. H G Wells observed a century ago that history is a race between education and disaster. Yet all the signs are that, in terms of earth\u2019s environment, no amount of education and information will deter seven billion Homo Sapiens from making decisions which, like Abbott\u2019s, prescribe a more barren and forlorn planet in the years to come. Oxonian Abbott is a Rhodes Scholar but intelligence can be counter-productive, if not dangerous, when it comes with a lack of empathy and compassion for other human beings and our natural living environment. Australians, amongst the best educated people in the world, voted in droves for Abbott because he was discriminatory, pugnacious and simplistic: \u201cstop the boats\u201d, \u201cno carbon tax\u201d, \u201cno mining tax\u201d and \u201clog Tasmania\u2019s World Heritage forests\u201d were all up-front in his winning election campaign. He made a highlight of cutting $4bn from aid to poor people overseas, promising Australians he would use the funds to build them better highways instead: it was another winner. Abbott is an outstanding advocate for me-now materialism and he was elected without subterfuge. He is what he stands for. A minority of people rate the environment, or the wellbeing of the world their grandchildren will inherit higher than the wellbeing of their wallets. However, Abbott also knows that hard-hearted exploitation of people and nature has its limits in any democracy. So he covered his homily to the loggers with an excuse to small-l liberal voters based on a studied lie. One of the first acts of the incoming government was to begin the process to try to get out of the World Heritage listing 74,000 hectares of country in Tasmania, because that 74,000 hectares is not pristine forest. It\u2019s forest which has been logged, it\u2019s forest which has been degraded; in some cases, it\u2019s plantation timber that was actually planted to be logged. Less than 10% of the forests he was referring to have been logged. If that were not so, why would the loggers want them? As with California\u2019s giant redwoods World Heritage area, there are small areas of damage from industrial logging included to give integrity to the protected zone but the vast majority is stunningly intact tall eucalyptus and rainforest filled with bird and animal species, including some threatened with extinction. Although 1% of Tasmanian jobs are in logging forests and 15% in tourism, the Tasmanian Liberals, emboldened by Abbott, are promising draconian penalties for anyone who gets in the way of the chainsaws which will destroy the wild and scenic forests. A law proposed by the Liberals put forward mandatory $10,000 fines for first offences and mandatory three month jail terms thereafter \u2013 penalties that don\u2019t apply to, say, white collar criminals. Whichever way you look at it, the logging of Tasmania\u2019s World Heritage value forests is unreasonable. But reason will be no barrier to more of the sort of visionless and destructive dogma the Australian prime minister regaled the loggers with in Parliament House this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
