The History Man by Malcolm Bradbury (1975) 'An elegant display of comic determinism, as smart as they come.' Money by Martin Amis (1984) 'A brilliant, frightening novel ... devoid of such outworn properties as charm.' The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks (1984) 'Sinisterly powerful, stylish and authoritative.' Nights at the Circus by Angela Carter (1984) 'A lavish, sumptuous invention.'
