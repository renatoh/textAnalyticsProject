(Well, Office Live will appear as an invitation-only beta early next year.) According to Reuters: Windows Live and Office Live will give users much of the functionality of the software giant's two most-profitable products, but without the complexity of installing and maintaining the software in computer hard drives, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Ray Ozzie, a longtime software services pioneer who recently joined Microsoft, told reporters in San Francisco. Windows Live will integrate instant-messaging, a new online email service, security, data storage and other features, all of which will be accessible over the Internet. Office Live will give smaller companies access to many of the features in Microsoft's collection of programs for business tasks, as well as the ability to maintain corporate email accounts and data. Michael Arrington of TechCrunch has some good pictures of the event on Flickr Comment: This is Microsoft's entry into the Web 2.0 market with AJAX-style applications. The Live site is clearly based on the experimental Start.com personalised home page site, which not only showed Microsoft could do something before Google, but do it better. However, it's one thing to do it in a sandbox, and quite another to do it on a commercial platform supporting millions of users. That's the challenge Microsoft faces now. The other thing that should be obvious is that the new sites are extensions of Windows and Office, not replacements for them. (Microsoft is not trying to get rid of $20bn worth of desktop software business.) However, as you can see at Windows Live Ideas, Live will eventually take over a lot of things from MSN, including instant messaging, horrible Hotmail (see Kahuna, below) and the hugely successful MSN Spaces blogging service. And as Jupiter Research analyst Michael Gartenberg says: There's been a lot of chatter about how this is a response to Google or how it's Microsoft being dragged into offering these type of services at the expense of losing it's traditional market for Office apps. Well, that analysis is all wrong. Microsoft has been planning this for quite some time, long before it would appear as a response to Google or anyone else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
