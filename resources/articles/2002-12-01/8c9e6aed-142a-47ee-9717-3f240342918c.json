Uefa has agreed to hear O'Neill's appeal against a two-game ban after his dismissal by the French referee Claude Columbo in the first leg at Celtic Park. The decision means O'Neill's punishment will be suspended until the appeal is heard at the start of next year, leaving him free to man the touchline in Spain. \u00b7 Everton have appealed against their defender David Unsworth's red card against Chelsea on Saturday, the Football Association said yesterday. Unsworth was sent off in the last minute of Saturday's match at Goodison Park after tangling with the Chelsea midfielder Jesper Gronkjaer but TV replays suggested the referee's verdict of violent conduct was harsh. \u00b7 Birmingham will be without Stern John for three weeks after the Trinidad and Tobago international had a knee operation yesterday. John has been playing on because of a striker shortage at St Andrews. \u00b7 Steve Paterson is expected to be named as the new Aberdeen manager today. Paterson's club Inverness Caledonian Thistle had given permission for him to speak to Aberdeen but a stumbling block developed over his assistant Duncan Shearer, the former Aberdeen striker. Shearer had been offered the job at Inverness and would have been on more money to stay, but after negotiations with the Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne, both men are expected to leave their posts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
