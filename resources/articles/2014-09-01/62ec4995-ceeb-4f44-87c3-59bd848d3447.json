At 34, the Englishman has featured in two clashes with the USA but not one as a home player. He played for Europe in a comprehensive 2008 loss at Valhalla and four years later at Medinah, where a dramatic singles victory over Phil Mickelson proved so influential in a stunning team recovery. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time so it\u2019s nice to get that one out of the way,\u201d says Rose of finally securing Ryder Cup home comforts. \u201cI\u2019d imagine Celtic Manor in 2010 was somewhat of a disappointing Ryder Cup; the way the weather was and the way the matches went, and going into a Monday. So I think Gleneagles will be a really great Ryder Cup to experience as my first one at home.\u201d Rose can testify to this event not always proving a friendly affair. He was one of the European players to be heckled at Medinah, along with his close friend, Ian Poulter. Rose had encountered similar treatment on his Ryder Cup debut. \u201cIt\u2019s not always friendly outside the ropes at the Ryder Cup,\u201d he explains. \u201cChicago was a tough, rough sports crowd, but there were definitely some occasions when it was \u2018woah, too far.\u2019 \u201cIt just makes it all the more enjoyable when it works out the way it did there. You really want to hear your crowd and, to be honest, on the Sunday when it went quiet it was a case of saying \u2018the silence was deafening for them.\u2019 When the place went quiet it was an eerie type of atmosphere. \u201cHopefully we can avoid that this week. The crowd do play a big part. I was on the receiving end of a crowd at Valhalla, as well. They were fantastic for the home team, Paul Azinger made them the 13th man and that was important. Paul McGinley will be recruiting the crowd to be as much on our side as possible.\u201d If Rose\u2019s Medinah Sunday was the stuff of dreams, he acknowledges the opposite applies to what came before. \u201cI have experienced six days of Ryder Cup golf and five of them have been pretty bleak,\u201d says the 2013 US Open champion. \u201cThe way things turned around at Medinah was phenomenal. \u201cTo be part of a winning team was something I had undervalued. It was an incredible experience and something I want to make sure we do again this time around.\u201d Still, Rose had to watch a television replay of that triumph over Mickelson to fully appreciate its significance. \u201cThe only thing I really remember is telling myself to stay aggressive, that I needed to deliver a full point,\u201d Rose recalls. \u201cEven at one down with two to play I was saying: \u2018You have to win this match, you have to win this match.\u2019 \u201cSometimes you would feel \u2018just get a half out of this, no damage done\u2019, but the situation that we were in meant you had to get everything out of it. It really was amazing how it all played out.\u201d It would be a surprise if Rose and Poulter aren\u2019t paired together at least once in this, the 40th Ryder Cup. Rose is among those best placed to assess Poulter\u2019s almost super-human attachment to facing the Americans. \u201cOn tour he gets in, gets out and does his business,\u201d says Rose of Poulter. \u201cBut in the Ryder Cup he\u2019s definitely vocal and will be talking to everyone. That\u2019s the thing about Poulter; he\u2019s not scared to be the leader in that environment. A lot of guys, although they think they have got good things to say, might just hold back and be introverted. That\u2019s certainly not Poults. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes him such a good team-room guy, he\u2019s not scared to speak his mind. He now has some great experience and with his record, he\u2019s even more confident to say what he feels.\u201d Despite a relative lack of Ryder Cup experience, Rose\u2019s own position in the European set-up has been strengthened by a major championship success and consistent placement with the world\u2019s top 10 golfers. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there should be a hierarchy in a team room,\u201d says Rose. \u201cI think you want to be a collective force but I also think the captain will also put a lot faith in me. He\u2019ll expect me to go out there and do a good job. I\u2019m comfortable with that, you have to be. It is not easy because you have seen guys like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, who don\u2019t have particularly amazing [Ryder Cup] records, relative to how good they are individually or in major championships. \u201cRyder Cup is an interesting thing. It is the team who gets the momentum, the team who gels and the team who has the great natural pairings, I think.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
