The bank warned that growth could stagnate until the middle of 2012 and was likely to reach only 1% for the year as a whole \u2013 half its previous forecast \u2013 as Britain battles pressures from the eurozone debt crisis. Delivering his quarterly inflation report, Sir Mervyn King, the bank's governor, said Britain would see inflation fall from its current level of 5% to nearer 1.5% by the middle of next year and stay below the bank's 2% target until at least 2014. The prospect of low growth and low inflation next year is also expected to take the pressure off the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) to raise base rates from their historically low level of 0.5%. Some analysts dismissed the Bank's prediction that growth would return to more than 2.5% by 2013 and 3% by 2014 as unrealistic. The City experts argued instead that a prolonged period of low growth would keep base rates below 1% over the next couple of years and under 3% for a decade. Phil Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he expected rates to stay at 0.5% until the end of 2013. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"The report both endorses market expectations that rates will stay on hold for the foreseeable future and suggests more policy loosening will yet be needed. What's more, even the MPC's downgraded growth forecasts still look optimistic to us \u2013 we expect zero growth next year. We had pencilled in another \u00a375bn of quantitative easing in February, but if the economic news over the next couple of weeks remains weak, the MPC might feel compelled to announce extra support as soon as next month.\" The bank is due to purchase an extra \u00a375bn of government debt from UK banks and major corporations by next February, taking the total quantitative easing (QE) spending to \u00a3275bn. QE floods the financial system with cash to replace some of the funds withdrawn from the economy, especially by foreign banks. One knock-on effect is to drive down long-term interest rates. A report by the bank this year argued the project had supported growth in the economy by making lending by UK banks cheaper and easier, though many City economists remain sceptical of the benefits. King has printed more electronic money as a proportion of national income than any other central banker. Michael Saunders, the chief UK economist of US investment bank Citi, has predicted the bank would need to generate a total \u00a3500bn of QE to offset the withdrawal of funds and a lack of demand while households and businesses pay down their debts. King joined the chancellor, George Osborne, in blaming the eurozone crisis and a slowdown in global growth for the UK's ills. UK banks were in better shape than many of their European counterparts, he said, but still struggled against a backdrop of sluggish growth. \"The immediate impact of the decline in sentiment is that the outlook for growth of the world economy has worsened since August. That is also true here in the United Kingdom, where activity could be broadly flat until around the middle of next year. We continue to face a difficult economic environment,\" King said. He claimed the failure of governments to recognise that indebted countries could be helped only if some of their debts are written off was holding back progress in the global economy. \"The underlying global problems of trade imbalances, unsustainable levels of external and internal indebtedness and loss of competitiveness remain. Sovereign and bank funding concerns are symptoms of these underlying problems,\" he said. \"The journey to a more balanced world economy will be long and arduous.\" The bank saw some recovery in 2013 with growth pencilled in at around 2.5%, down from the 3% previously predicted. Overall the \"prospects for the UK economy have worsened\", the report said. The bank's 1% forecast for growth in 2012 is well below the 2.5% predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent body responsible for the government's economic forecasts. The OBR is widely expected to cut that forecast when it publishes its latest predictions on 29 November when the chancellor will deliver his autumn statement. That follows several gloomy consumer and business surveys that indicate companies and households are reining in spending amid worries about the economy at home and abroad. King said he had \"immense sympathy\" with the people he meets on his visits around the UK who are suffering as they try to keep their businesses going and to stay afloat despite the squeeze on incomes. \"These people were not responsible for the crisis and they are suffering enormously as a result of it,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
