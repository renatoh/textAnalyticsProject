Mr Mandelson was summoned to No 10 to explain his involvement with the passport application of Indian tycoon Srichand Hinduja. After meeting the prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr Mandelson said outside 10 Downing Street that he did not accept he had acted \"improperly in any way\" over the passport for favours row. But he said he wanted to distance himself from the \"countless stories and controversies of feuds and divisions\" that had surrounded him. \"I want to lead a more normal life,\" he said. This afternoon, Mr Mandelson took Northern Ireland questions in the Commons where he defended the government's handling of the RUC reform. But he did not expand on his decision to resign. Northern Ireland's first minister, David Trimble, thanked Mr Mandelson for his work in the province over the past year and said: \"I and many others appreciate the efforts he has done.\" Tony Blair told the Commons that Northern Ireland had Mr Mandelson to thank for sustained peace in the province. Responding to an attack on Mr Mandelson by the Tory leader, William Hague, Mr Blair retorted: \"He's a bigger man than many of his critics.\" News of the resignation has sent shockwaves through Westminster, Northern Ireland and beyond, with Mr Mandelson saying that working on the Ulster peace process was the \"greatest privilege\" of his political life. The Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, urged the government not to be distracted from the search for a solution in the province by the fallout of Mr Mandelson's resignation. \"It is a matter of public record that Peter Mandelson and Sinn Fein were in disagreement over many issues. Notwithstanding that, I wish him well for the future,\" he said. Dermott Nesbitt, an Ulster Unionist minister at Stormont, said it was sad for Mr Mandelson personally, but that the political process would continue. \"We in the Ulster Unionist party want to see stability and we will work with whoever is appointed to replace him.\" Mr Hinduja, whose naturalisation request set off the row, said in a statement: \"We are sad to see Mr Mandelson's resignation. I wish to reiterate that I have never at any time linked our support for the faith zone of the Millennium Dome with our request to Mr Mandelson for information in 1998.\" Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP who asked the original parliamentary question about Mr Mandelson's involvement with the Hinduja passport application, said the resignation had been inevitable. \"He had exposed the prime minister and his colleagues in a very unhelpful way,\" he said. \"The government is keen to distance itself from the Tory years of sleaze and Mr Mandelson was not helping that process.\" Former No 10 press officer and long-time friend of Mr Mandelson Tim Allan today said the Hartlepool MP would think \"long and hard\" before dropping his constituency, and also insisted the ex-Northern Ireland secretary would want to remain in public life. But following the announcement of Mr Mandelson's resignation, the prime minister's spokesman told reporters: \"I think Peter's making clear from his statement that he is clearly looking to wind down his political activity.\" This is the second time that Mr Mandelson has resigned from the government. In December 1998, he quit as trade and industry secretary after the Guardian exposed a secret \u00a3373,000 loan from fellow minister Geoffrey Robinson.
