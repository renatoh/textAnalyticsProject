Australia\u2019s mortality rate from coronavirus is thankfully one of the lowest in the world so far, but most of the deaths have been people aged 70 and over. Globally, the mortality rate is highest for the 80-plus age group, which now stands above 10%. Children, meanwhile, seem less susceptible to the worst effects but carry the risk of infecting others. For the grandmother of four and her husband, an 80-year-old psychiatrist, that means a strict new diktat: grandparenting from a distance. With their grandchildren living over the garden fence and their daily lives deeply entwined, familial distancing is no small undertaking. \u201cThe last time we had any physical contact was the 14th of March,\u201d Susan says. \u201cAll my time was geared around the children but it\u2019s all changed. They\u2019re not allowed into the house any more and so we see them over the fence and on FaceTime. \u201cI understand it but it\u2019s hard. It goes against all our ideas of togetherness and contact and the bonds that you make with children. I keep thinking, \u2018Why aren\u2019t they here?\u2019\u201d Susan\u2019s daughter Lizzie is getting used to a new daily juggle of work, childcare and family life without the parental support she and her partner relied upon. \u201cThe hardest thing is that, because we are working, we don\u2019t have the option of taking our children out of school and daycare without the normal help from my parents,\u201d says the medical device specialist, 42. \u201cBut letting them spend time together is not worth the risk.\u201d By erring on the side of caution, they are among the growing number of families without underlying illnesses who pre-empted, and went further than, the warnings of the likes of the Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who this week told parents: \u201cIf you have a grandparent who is unwell, who has one of those chronic conditions, you must not take your children to visit those grandparents. These are very clear messages.\u201d Prof Linda Selvey, infectious diseases epidemiologist with the school of public health at the University of Queensland, acknowledges that with evidence about the disease constantly emerging, the best course of action can, in fact, feel less than clear. \u201cAre children at greater risk of transmitting the infection than anybody else? Probably not,\u201d Selvey says. But, as she points out, they are less likely to wash their hands properly and they want more physical contact than others, both factors in Covid-19\u2019s spread. She adds that it\u2019s important to include elderly people in decision-making processes around family distancing. For grandfather and clinical professor in paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, David Isaacs, older people need our protection, no matter the age group they are exposed to. \u201cWhat evidence there is suggests that older people give it to children, if anything,\u201d he says. \u201cIt then spreads within family groups.\u201d But children are often mildly infected or asymptomatic, and we don\u2019t yet know how likely an asymptomatic person is to spread the disease. Because of that possibility of exposure to the virus, no matter how minimal, Isaacs is unambiguous. \u201cThe actual risk that the children will give it to [grandparents] is probably not that high, but how would you feel if your children gave your parents the virus and then they got desperately sick or died?\u201d The question, then, becomes how to enforce separation without plunging vulnerable people into a contact void. Isaacs \u2013 whose children have barred visits from his toddler grandson \u2013 stresses that this is no time to step away from interaction with elderly people. Now, more than ever, is a time for support \u2013 and physical distancing, not social isolation, is key to the health of our older population. Complete separation comes with its own set of complications, their importance often drowned out by the din around the immediate dangers of the virus. Scientia Prof Henry Brodaty, co-director of UNSW\u2019s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, is physically distancing himself from his own grandchildren yet warns that, for some elderly people, the dangers of not seeing their grandchildren might outweigh the alternative. \u201cOne of my patients is very isolated and she\u2019s depressed and she\u2019s bereaved and really the one light in her week is her visit from her grandchildren,\u201d he says. For now, though, the official word remains. This virus kills. Stay at home, stay apart where necessary \u2013 but, also, make sure to stay in touch. And so the new normal for family generations living close is love at a sensible distance. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly made a difference to the house, it\u2019s much tidier and quieter, but I do hear the occasional pierced scream and laughter from next door,\u201d Susan says. \u201cI\u2019m finding it hard but it\u2019s still new. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that this isn\u2019t short term \u2013 it\u2019s strange to think that there\u2019s a big expanse of time ahead and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She pauses: \u201cNo one really knows.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
