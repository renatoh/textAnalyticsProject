Eleven years on, could I find out what happened to my attackers?", "bodyText": "In early 2017, I was invited to a four-week artist residency in Lisbon, Portugal. The residency was not particularly prestigious: it charged a fee for the room I was to stay in, a barely habitable space perched above a gallery behind a series of locked doors. The bed for my partner and I was a mattress on a stack of shipping crates; the kitchenette was little more than a microwave and a bar fridge. To cover the residency fee, I applied for and received a small literary grant. In my application, I wrote that \u201cengaging readers and collaborators internationally\u201d would be a \u201cvital step in my career development\u201d. The residency would enable me to \u201clearn new creative methodologies in transdisciplinary artistic workshops, alongside a host of international artists\u201d and give me the opportunity to present my work \u201cwithin an international context\u201d for the first time. None of this was technically a lie. I was a resident at the gallery; I did share pasta dinners and cheap wine with the other artists \u2013 from Brazil, Wales, Argentina. And we did discuss our respective projects, which might have been called presenting my work within an international context. But it wasn\u2019t the whole truth, either. My reason for being in Lisbon (I had plotted and planned to get back there) was to find court documents related to a sexual assault that had been committed against me in the city 11 years earlier, when I was 18 years old. I read somewhere that the average age of a first violent sexual assault \u2013 for victims and perpetrators of rape or attempted rape \u2013 is 18 and a half. I haven\u2019t been able to verify this statistic. Online, there are many different authoritative-sounding claims about ages and likelihoods: 16 to 19 for victims; 28 to 33 for perpetrators. Because of taboos and improper reporting methods, sexual assault data is not as strong as it should be. But that number, that 18 and a half, seemed right to me, stuck with me, because it was my number. That is exactly how old I was when, overseas for the first time, on a sabbatical from full-time study, I was lured, then kidnapped, then subjected to an attempted rape by two young men, Tomas and Salvator, in an apartment just outside Lisbon. It is exactly how old I was when I fought and screamed and ran, early morning, down a hill, through shrubbery, along a highway, where a cop picked me up and drove me back to the city, and groped my leg as I considered rolling out the door of the moving vehicle. Eighteen and a half: just old enough to make serious claims on my independence; old enough to insist on taking responsibility for the risks involved in becoming a whole person. Eighteen and a half: so unbearably young. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Lisbon, May, 2006. Outside the club, I dangled my legs over the edge of the wide river, my feet swinging like a purse at the end of a long strap. Above me was Lisbon\u2019s big red bridge, just like the Golden Gate in San Francisco. The girl I had gone to the club with, the woman I had bonded with earlier in the night, was kissing her new man inside while I waited. Her hair was long and wavy, and she laughed at all my jokes. I was vaguely embarrassed that she\u2019d brought me there to sit and wait for her. I smoked cigarette after cigarette and talked to two young men at the edge of the water. Boys, really. Were they business students? I am Australian. They longed to visit Australia. So we swapped email addresses, just as I had swapped them, dropped them, in every city I had stepped through along the way. At daybreak, 6am or so, the club closed and the boys suggested we get breakfast, \u201cthe best pastel de Bel\u00e9m in Bel\u00e9m\u201d. I went to say goodbye to my new friend. She told me not to go with them. \u201cI\u2019ll go with them,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d The woman with long wavy hair wrote her number on a piece of card that I slipped into my wallet. I didn\u2019t have a phone. At 29, in 2017, I was not in denial about any of it. Not really. I had told the story of me in Lisbon at 18 hundreds of times. From the morning of the assault, I told anyone who would listen. The more I simplified the story, the more comfortable with it I became; I integrated the facts of it into my identity. I had been terrified, I said, but I wasn\u2019t harmed, not beyond repair. While afterwards I trusted people a little less, I said, I didn\u2019t fear sex, or men, or even travelling alone. I even told a psychologist about it once, and then quickly assured him that it was absolutely not the cause of my distress. I didn\u2019t think about the word \u201ctrauma\u201d until years later, when I noticed that my nerves could not hold still, not even in a minor crisis. Like when a little white dog we all thought had been killed at the traffic lights, popped out from under the bonnet a second later, unharmed. A kinky nothing said to me by a lover in bed, the same words that one of my assailants said as he pinned down my wrists, urging his friend to violate me. A kitchen fire at a dinner party, where the thud of terror yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t try to fight it \u2013 run\u201d, to my embarrassment, while friends successfully smothered the flames with tea towels. The fantasy that things are somehow safe, which you need to have if you are to do anything at all, had been pulled right out from under me. By the third day of the residency, I had settled in, and felt ready to start looking for the documents from the trial. I got the number for the police station and made plans to call. I did not call the police that day. Instead I read, I chatted with other artists, I walked around the city. I looked out at the Atlantic Ocean from the edge of Lisbon, and I felt the mound of tension in my stomach grow. I wouldn\u2019t work up the courage to call the number for the police until the sixth day. \u201cI have a strange request,\u201d I said to the officer on the other end. \u201cIn 2006, I was the victim of a crime in Lisbon, and it went to court. But I had to leave Portugal before I was able to find out what happened, so I\u2019d like to see if I can track down the documents from this time.\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was 11 years ago. The problem is, 11 years later, our paper has absolutely no meaning whatsoever.\u201d \u201c\u2018Absolutely no meaning whatsoever\u2019,\u201d I repeated. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d The man explained his brilliant mistranslation: \u201cIt means,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the situation was a long time ago and the situation is in the archives; it has been archived for 10 years.\u201d \u201cIs it possible to access the file from the archives? I don\u2019t intend to pursue the matter, I just want to read it.\u201d \u201cI can print it for you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has absolutely no meaning. If you want, you can send an email to the police. The situation is that we don\u2019t give the police report in an email.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come in person,\u201d I said, and hung up, put my shoes on, and left the gallery. My partner and I walked to the police station downtown. I sat on a plastic chair to wait my turn, just as I had 11 years earlier. Back then, my organs had felt heavy from no sleep, from the trauma, from the traces of alcohol still in my blood. Yet I managed to perform the role of a strong, reliable, resilient witness to my own assault. I was chipper and businesslike. I buried my shame deep alongside my fear and I gave my statement, describing how two young men had conspired to rape me and almost succeeded, but I had escaped by agreeing to other acts of violence, and then by my hysteria, and then by my physical desperation to flee. I was so chipper that, once I\u2019d finished and signed my statement, the policeman taking down my report wrote his number on a piece of paper and said, \u201cI finish at 10 \u2013 let me take you out and show you the real Lisbon.\u201d At the station in 2017, I explained myself. I was looking for the documents, the paper that has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. The officer behind the desk printed off what he could find: the initial report I made in 2006. Then, he sent me to another office, an enormous, modern building a half-hour\u2019s walk away. At the Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria, I explained six, seven, eight more times what I was now referring to as \u201cthe situation\u201d. Finally, someone seemed to understand what I was after. The report. The file. The verdict of the trial that I never found out. I was told to wait. After an hour waiting in the vast lobby, a detective, Cristina, came out to explain that I would need to call yet another department. There would be a different reference number for my case: my name had been incorrectly spelled in the initial report. I thanked her, and walked the five miles back to the gallery. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 In court, in 2006, before I left Portugal, the two boys\u2019 lawyers were each allowed to ask me a question. Tomas\u2019s lawyer wanted to know if I thought that his client was sorry for what he\u2019d done. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, knowing that this was true. He was, I believed, horrified by what he had done. Salvator\u2019s lawyer asked whether it was true that I\u2019d said, before his client took me to an apartment, locked me in a room and pinned me down with the intention to rape me, \u201cTake me home and I\u2019ll fuck you\u201d? I leapt up. \u201cNo! No, that\u2019s not true. No, I\u2019ve never said that to anyone.\u201d Which was true. I had never even thought of that constellation of words before. While it was Tomas\u2019s cowardice that got me into that room that sorry morning (he could not stand up to his domineering friend), it was his cowardice that got me out, too. As I kicked and screamed under the boys\u2019 weight, heaving-crying and thinking that I would die, I desperately repeated, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, just please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d In that moment, I had a split-second vision that determined everything else I did to survive. The picture was viewed from above: my body being dismembered and thrown into the Atlantic. Tomas \u2013 the coward, my hero \u2013 lost his cool. He burst into tears and rolled off the bed. And it was suddenly clear to Salvator that he couldn\u2019t handle the rape on his own, not under the witness of his failed collaborator. And I repeated the mantra, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, just please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d And Tomas continued to cry and shouted at Salvator in Portuguese. And Salvator shouted, in English, \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving.\u201d I found my shirt and my skirt and my shoes and I bundled them up in my arms. Salvator and Tomas screamed at one another. I pulled on some of my clothes. And Tomas said to me, \u201cCome on.\u201d And I moved towards the door. And Tomas made as if to open it. And we, one of us, opened it. And Salvator slammed his arm between me and the door. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d And I knew he was a psychopath. So when Tomas\u2019s lawyer asked if I thought he was sorry, I thought: yes, Tomas was sorry. I am convinced that if Tomas had not been there, I would not be alive, that Salvator would have raped and murdered me right there. I am convinced that my family and friends might never have discovered what had happened to me. Decades would have passed, and my mother would still be looking for me. A week into my residency, I had the number of the office that was holding my files. I called every day. Yet every time I called, something intervened. My Skype app automatically updated itself. The sketchy gallery internet dropped out. The receptionist couldn\u2019t understand me and hung up. After days of this, I tried the other number, the number that Cristina had given me in case I needed to reach her, and no one picked up. When finally I got through, I explained myself to an English-speaking receptionist, who put me on hold while I was transferred to another officer who didn\u2019t speak English. Each time I spoke to someone new, I explained \u201cthe situation\u201d. Each time, it felt like a punch in the face. Like a boxer, I prepared myself for each blow. Yet when each one came, I was stunned. Finally, I reached Cristina. \u201cYou want a copy of the investigation? Call back on Monday,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a lot of work today.\u201d I crossed my fingers and set an alarm, as if I could forget. I absent-mindedly wrote in my notebook: \u201cThis is my story. Yet I cannot find the documents. They are mine.\u201d I understood that just because something happened to me, it didn\u2019t suspend the suppressions of time and the failures of memory and the most human of all errors, bureaucratic filing systems. It did not escape me, either, that what I was looking for did not exist. Closure. Resolution. The true story. I wanted a copy of the investigation, which had been archived for 10 years and was seemingly impossible to dredge up; I wanted to find out how Salvator and Tomas described the events in their words, if only so I could scoff at their lies; I wanted to know what judgment concluded the trial, if only to suffer through a not-guilty verdict. But none of it mattered, not really. None of it could push the factory-reset button, or assist my interior life, except to make me remember things my body had buried. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 On the 17th day, Cristina called and said I was to go to the district court in a distant precinct where she had discovered the file had been archived. The regional train raced past the docklands, beneath the red bridge, out towards the beach. To the left, the Atlantic Ocean opened up before me, slick and chilly. To the right, blond apartments emerged in rows from the thick green hills strewn with wild yellow flowers. It was in there, in one of those apartments, that it had happened. We found the courthouse, stark, fascist, Latin-white. I gave the young receptionist my notebook, where I had written my list of demands in Google Translate Portuguese. She called over an older woman with plump cheeks who spoke English. \u201cYou must apply to see the process file,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has already been archived.\u201d \u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d \u201cWhat is your reason?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you want to see it?\u201d \u201cI had to leave Portugal. I never found out what happened.\u201d The woman looked at the computer screen and typed. Finally, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the sentence, but I can say the man, the accused, his sentence was annulled.\u201d I blinked. \u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cYou will need to fill out a form to find the senten\u00e7a, the precise judgement. The court will telephone once the judge has decided whether you can see the file.\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in Lisbon for another 10 days.\u201d Five days later, I received the email saying that I had permission to access the files. The police report, the court notes, the verdict. The court\u2019s archivist, Jo\u00e3o, was gentle and authoritative. Exactly as he ought to be, I thought. He smoothed his hand over the open pages of the two thick binders, talking me through everything that had happened after I left. Salvator corroborated my testimony. He was not charged. Tomas was prosecuted. He was given a suspended sentence of 12 months and required to pay \u20ac500 to a victims\u2019 support organisation. Tomas then appealed, and his sentence was annulled. As Jo\u00e3o methodically copied the documents, I swung around to my partner. \u201cBut Salvator was the evil one,\u201d I say. \u201cSalvator. Not Tomas.\u201d And, of course, I knew in an instant that my memory was wrong. I must have, at some point, switched the names and faces. And if I had been so certain about something so wrong, what else? What else had I changed? Another day, another anxious train ride home, I thought. But this time the anxiety had an object. I had their full names. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Back at the gallery, I typed their names into a search engine, but not much came up. Their names were common. I wanted revenge. I thought about hiring a private detective. And then, I found the private Facebook account of one Tomas with the same succession of middle and surnames as my assailant. I wrote him a message: \u201cDo you know me.\u201d Back at the gallery, I began to type passages from the court documents into Google Translate. I began to read a broken translation of Salvator\u2019s statement. What it revealed stopped me in my tracks. The two boys had been speaking in Portuguese as they assaulted me, and I was too traumatised to notice. I am lucky I didn\u2019t understand what they said to one another. Tomas\u2019s deliberation and cruelty had been much worse than I\u2019d known. I read as much as I could, which was not much, and closed my laptop. My partner and I packed our things and flew home. The documents are in a folder at the bottom of a box in my wardrobe. Tomas never responded to the Facebook message. I never hired a private detective. Something in me settled. I didn\u2019t like the story \u2013 I still don\u2019t like to think what might be necessary for a perpetrator of sexual assault to get a conviction \u2013 but I accepted it as a small part of my life that I could know, as much as I could know anything. Which is to say I knew the story now. Blueberries: Essays Concerning Understanding, by Ellena Savage, is published by Scribe on 9 April, priced \u00a39.99.
