Ive\u2019s departure, which was announced in an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, is sure to set off shock waves in the tech and design worlds, but the 52-year-old Briton will remain involved with Apple. He plans to launch a new creative company called LoveFrom \u2013 and said Apple will be his first client. \u201cWhile I will not be an employee, I will still be very involved \u2013 I hope for many, many years to come,\u201d Ive told the FT. \u201cThis just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change.\u201d \u201cJony is a singular figure in the design world and his role in Apple\u2019s revival cannot be overstated,\u201d chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cApple will continue to benefit from Jony\u2019s talents by working directly with him on exclusive projects, and through the ongoing work of the brilliant and passionate design team he has built.\u201d Cook further paid tribute to Ive in an interview with the FT, highlighting his role in rescuing the company from its early-90s doldrums: \u201cThe work on the original iMac was sort of the point at which people began to pay attention to Apple again on something other than how badly economically the company was doing. \u201cWe get to continue with the same team that we\u2019ve had for a long time and have the pleasure of continuing to work with Jony,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a better result.\u201d Ive\u2019s departure comes at a tricky moment for Apple, which became the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company in August 2018, but has faltered amid increased competition, slowing demand for smartphones, and the escalating trade war between the US and China. The company shocked investors in January when it was forced to downgrade sales forecasts , the first such warning the company had issued since 2002. In recent months, Apple has moved to diversify its revenues away from hardware sales and toward subscription services, including a bid to take on Netflix with original entertainment content. Apple\u2019s stock fell approximately 1% in after-hours trading on news of Ive\u2019s departure. Ive\u2019s influence at Apple pre-dates his employment there. He worked on the company\u2019s original Apple PowerBook 140, released in 1991, while still employed by the British design firm Tangerine. His first truly iconic hit after joining Apple was the 1998 iMac with its translucent \u201cBondi blue\u201d casing. Next came the iPod, the iPhone and the Apple Watch. But Ive\u2019s influence extended beyond hardware design. Starting in 2012, he took over design of Apple\u2019s software, which resulted in a total overhaul of the iPhone\u2019s operating system, iOS. Ive jettisoned the cutesy faux leather and paper icons and pseudo-3D textures, opting for flat and abstract iconography. He was also involved in designing Apple\u2019s new headquarters, Apple Park, the $5bn futuristic \u201cspaceship\u201d that opened in 2017. The designer also had his share of misses \u2013 and critics. As stunning as Apple Park\u2019s four-story glass walls may be, the minimalist design failed to include the usual markings that can prevent birds \u2013 and humans \u2013 from walking into them, resulting in multiple 911-call-inducing accidents. In March, Apple debuted a beautifully absurd \u201claser-etched\u201d titanium credit card that drew instant ridicule. No immediate successor has been named to fill Ive\u2019s role as chief design officer. The heads of the company\u2019s user interface team and industrial design teams, Alan Dye and Evans Hankey, will both report to the chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, Apple said. \u201cI certainly have an ambition and feel almost a moral obligation to be useful,\u201d Ive told the paper. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to work with remarkable people over the last 30-plus years and have worked on some very interesting projects and solved some very difficult problems. I feel keenly aware of a responsibility to do something significant with that learning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
