At that meeting, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, promised to dismantle a missile engine test site and launchpad, and made a conditional offer to shut down his country\u2019s main nuclear complex at Yongbyon. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Wednesday he had invited his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, to meet in New York next week where both diplomats will be attending the UN general assembly. Other North Korean officials have been asked to meet US special envoy, Stephen Biegun, in Vienna. Donald Trump also welcomed this week\u2019s Pyongyang meeting between Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. \u201cWe\u2019re making tremendous progress with respect to North Korea,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding: \u201cWe have a lot of very good things going.\u201d In a written statement, Pompeo said: \u201cThis will mark the beginning of negotiations to transform US-DPRK relations through the process of rapid denuclearization of North Korea, to be completed by January 2021, as committed by Chairman Kim, and to construct a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula.\u201d A day after their joint address, Moon and Kim headed out for a visit to the symbolic home of the Korean people, Mt Paektu, which sits on North Korea\u2019s border with China. Travelling to Mt Paektu has been a long-held dream for Moon, who is an avid hiker and has previously trekked in the Himalayas. The mountain is a key piece in North Korean propaganda, and the official biographies of the country\u2019s founder and its second leader \u2013 Kim\u2019s grandfather and father \u2013 say they were both born in the shadow of the mountain, bolstering their claim to the leadership. The mountain is also mentioned in South Korea\u2019s national anthem and it features prominently in traditional Korean art. Since Trump declared North Korea \u201cno longer a nuclear threat\u201d following his own summit with Kim in Singapore in June, progress in disarmament negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang has stalled, as it has become clear the two leaders had very different conceptions of what the process would entail. Observers noted on Wednesday that Pompeo was similarly exaggerating what Kim had agreed on Tuesday in Pyongyang. In a joint declaration, it was agreed that the two sides would \u201ccooperate closely in the process of pursuing complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\u201d. For Pyongyang, the phrase signifies a phased process of mutual confidence building and arms control that would involve significant US concessions, not unilateral disarmament by Pyongyang. There was no mention of a deadline, as Pompeo had claimed. At his summit this week with Moon, Kim agreed to complete the dismantlement of a missile engine test and launch site in the north-west of the country, something he had previously offered to do in Singapore. The secretary of state also noted that Kim had undertaken to dismantle facilities at Yongbyon \u201cin the presence of US and IAEA inspectors\u201d. That would be a more dramatic step, although one that Pyongyang has partly carried out before, blowing up a reactor cooling tower 10 years ago. However, in the joint declaration in Pyongyang, Kim did not mention inspectors and made the offer to dismantle Yongbyon contingent on the US taking \u201ccorresponding measures\u201d. He did not make clear what those measures should be. \u201cThe North Koreans want reciprocal action. What is that reciprocal action? They don\u2019t specify so we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sue Mi Terry, a former senior CIA Korea analyst now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt is more than a peace declaration \u2013 a peace treaty, we have a problem.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think this really moves the ball forward. The different definitions of denuclearization are still there.\u201d When asked about what concessions the US might make to North Korea, Trump replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s looking at. We\u2019ll see. But in the meantime, we\u2019re talking. It\u2019s very calm. He\u2019s calm, I\u2019m calm. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Jung Pak, another former US intelligence official, noted the Pyongyang declaration had come on the anniversary of a 2005 multilateral agreement in which North Korea had \u201ccommitted to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs\u201d. \u201cWe should recognise that 13 years ago they agreed to far bigger concessions,\u201d said Pak, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cKim is trying to turn back the clock and set the terms of what he is willing to talk about. These are minuscule moves on Kim\u2019s part and we should treat them accordingly.\u201d In contrast to the vague undertaking on denuclearization, the military annex to the Pyongyang declarations included very detailed steps both North and South Korea are to take to reduce the chance of any unintended border incident escalating into war. Areas around the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas are to be declared no-fly zones, the defence forces of both sides are to follow multi-step protocols to defuse border incidents, and guard posts along the DMZ are to be withdrawn. \u201cLessening the danger of a conventional military confrontation, which could escalate to the use of nuclear weapons is essential,\u201d said Joel Wit, a former state department official and senior fellow at the Stimson Centre thinktank. \u201cThe agreement reached at the Moon-Kim summit, which begins to move away from 60 years of confrontation since the Korean war, is a first step in that direction.\u201d Kim and Moon also agreed on measures to revive economic cooperation, which could run afoul of Washington\u2019s efforts to maintain sanctions on North Korea. \u201cThe 600lb gorilla in the room is sanctions,\u201d Victor Cha, a former director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. \u201cSouth Korea is promising all of these goodies to the North but can\u2019t do any of it with sanctions in place. The subtext is clear: Seoul is going to approach the US to lift sanctions so it can pursue the inter-Korean peace, but the sanctions are on the regime for denuclearization and human rights abuses. Crossed lines that look like we are headed for a train wreck.\u201d Cha said the progress in Pyongyang towards denuclearization was minimal. \u201cTrump is praising it all which is astounding to me. You have a president taking credit for things that have not yet happened [denuclearization] and a DPRK leader agreeing to do what he has already done with the South Koreans applauding it as new.\u201d Joseph Yun, a former US special envoy on North Korea, said that while vague and conditional, Kim\u2019s offer to dismantle Yongbyon at least offered a route out of the current impasse in nuclear negotiations. \u201cIt opens the door a little bit,\u201d said Yun, now a senior adviser at the US Institute of Peace. \u201cIt could be the beginning of a process. I would very much hope that Washington would respond constructively to this opening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
