A couple, newly broken up, are now confined in their tiny apartment. And a woman rejoicing that her partner has finally moved in: \u201cAll it took was worldwide quarantine for him to finally commit.\u201d All are slices of life under lockdown, submitted by strangers anonymously to The Social Distance Project: an online community documenting the everyday, domestic dramas sparked by a pandemic. Inspired by the popular PostSecret blog, it is an irresistible look through the keyhole into other people\u2019s quarantines, from the woman who decided to quarantine with her boyfriend \u2013 and his mother \u2013 after only three dates; to the college student and long-time knitter, irate that her mom\u2019s new \u201cquarantine hobby\u201d of making pom-poms is using up all her best yarn: \u201cGod help us all get out of this fast.\u201d The project came about through a tweet. Midway through March Meg Zukin, a writer in Los Angeles, had realised the toll that quarantining would likely take on her own relationship. She tweeted: \u201cif u live with a significant other and think all the co-quarantining will cause u to break up, email me \u2026 i\u2019m not writing a story im just messy and love drama.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d really been thinking about how this will have such a profound effect on people\u2019s personal lives, and that isn\u2019t being talked about in the news because there are more important things going on on the macro scale,\u201d Zukin says now. \u201cBut if you break up with a partner during this \u2013 or because of this \u2013 that\u2019s still a major life adjustment.\u201d Zukin\u2019s tweet went viral, and her inbox was flooded with messages from people wanting to confide in a stranger about how their personal lives had been changed by coronavirus. Whether it was heartbreaking or petty, there was a sense of relief to having been asked, she says. One woman wrote a seven-page \u201cessay\u201d about the difficulties she was experiencing with her husband. \u201cShe was just so thankful that someone was opening up a space to talk about relationship issues during quarantine,\u201d says Zukin. \u201cPeople were definitely looking for a place to vent.\u201d Another woman, a teacher, wrote that her husband was so worried about contracting coronavirus from her, he had moved in with his mother. \u201cThe impact on people\u2019s personal lives \u2013 it\u2019s almost overwhelming to think about,\u201d says Zukin. \u201cI feel like a lot of people feel as though their personal anxieties or fights with their partner or family member are not important and they should just be grateful that they have a place to live \u2013 but it\u2019s not nothing, just because it\u2019s not top-billed news.\u201d In that first flood following her tweet, Zukin received some 500 messages. When her friends started asking for the juiciest stories she\u2019d been told, she realised that there was a market for them. With permission, Zukin brought together their stories anonymously in a Google document \u2013 then requested a small donation in exchange for the link to access it. From an average donation of US $1, she has raised almost $9,000 for food banks, housing support and Covid-19 relief. Though the rate of giving has slowed, Zukin continues to be sent slices of life from strangers in lockdown, which she shares on The Social Distance\u2019s website and Instagram account, which now has 15,000 followers. \u201cI don\u2019t really see the project slowing down, as long as we\u2019re still in isolation,\u201d she says. One man, while browsing the \u201cwonderful project\u201d, realised he was reading about his own infidelity \u2013 then submitted his own follow-up, about sharing \u201ca break-up cake\u201d with his now ex-girlfriend. Zukin\u2019s aim now is to create a sense of community, in spite of quarantine \u2013 \u201cjust reminding people they\u2019re not alone during this\u201d. Plus, Zukin points out: shut in our homes, away from our friends and coworkers, we might be feeling a little starved of gossip right now. \u201cI think we\u2019re all fascinated by other people\u2019s business \u2026 When not much is going on in your day, there\u2019s only so much to say or do.\u201d But it has not been just the drama that has registered. A 68-year-old woman wrote this week about how her husband of almost 50 years had come across their old love letters. \u201cFor the next hour or so he would run in with another letter, I would read it, and we would laugh and reminisce about how young and in love we were,\u201d she wrote, of the \u201cmoment of togetherness, caused by the Covid-19 shutdown\u201d. Zukin says readers have responded well to such positive stories. \u201cAt first I was thinking that misery loves company, but \u2026 it\u2019s about feeling connected when we are physically isolated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
