Scarlatti considered it his finest oratorio, and its dramatic structure, rapidly interweaving brief scenes in Holofernes's camp with events in the troubled city, is remarkable. Apart from the closing pages, however, the music is efficient rather than inspired. The recording, based around performances at the Ambronay festival in Alsace, is carefully conducted by Martin Gester. As Judith, C\u00e9line Ricci is implacably steely and not always convincing in the seduction scenes, while countertenor Martin Oro's Holofernes sounds far too genteel. The best performance comes from tenor Vincenzo Di Donato as Achior, the captain so revolted by Holofernes' brutality that he defects to the Israelite army."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
