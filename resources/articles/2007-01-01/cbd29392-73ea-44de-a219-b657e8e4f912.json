Officially open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays, it's also open on Fridays to wholesalers, although individuals won't be turned away. More than 200,000 people shop at the market each day, buying everything from clothes to watches - imitation, brand new and second-hand - leather goods, silk, food and livestock. Don't forget to bargain for the best price and beware when buying 'antiques' as many are simply good fakes. Take the Skytrain to Mo Chit station and follow the crowd, or ask your tuk-tuk driver to take you to Suan Jatujak (Chatuchak park)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
