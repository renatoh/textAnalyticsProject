The New York Post, for example, is all for extending the war to Iraq. Under the headline \"On to Baghdad\", its main leader praises President Bush for demanding that Saddam Hussein once again allow UN weapons inspectors into the country. It goes on: \"But while Bush did not make clear what consequences await the Butcher of Baghdad, the need to take him out has been obvious ever since the president's father declined to do just that at the end of the Gulf War. All available evidence shows that Saddam never abandoned his dream of building a nuclear and biological arsenal. And his connection to terrorism is even more direct; according to recent reports, he has established a secret camp that has trained an array of Islamic terrorists from across the Middle East.\" Over in California, the San Diego Union-Tribune is also predicting that Baghdad could be the next target: \"In handing a blunt warning to Saddam Hussein that Iraq will suffer consequences if it continues to bar United Nations arms inspectors, President Bush has laid bare a constructive debate in the war on terrorism. At issue are what measures, if any, the international community should take to contain Iraq's threatening weapons programs, which are widely believed to include nuclear, chemical and biological arms. President Bush, emphasising once again that \"Afghanistan is still just the beginning,\" has plainly signalled that a showdown with Baghdad could become the next phase in the anti-terror campaign. In the Washington Post, columnist Michael Kelly launches into critics of US military tactics in Afghanistan, who said that the war was unjust and could never be won. Instead, he writes: \"We have learned conclusively that the Taliban were not the government of the Afghan people. They were a foreign tyranny imposed on the Afghan people. The power that came from the barrel of a gun in Afghanistan came ultimately from guns held not by Afghans but by tens of thousands of foreign mercenaries imported by the Taliban and al-Qaida. \"Destroying Afghanistan's occupiers did not mean killing innocent Afghans but freeing them from fascist oppression. We have learned that bombing did not result in the death of millions, but in the rescue of millions. Thanks to liberation, food is pouring into Afghanistan now, and the millions of refugees who fled the Taliban are beginning to return home. We have learned that the Taliban would rather switch than die. We have learned that al-Qaida had constructed in Afghanistan a system for training, dispersing and financing thousands of anti-American terrorists now at large in the world.\" But not all US commentators are gung-ho about recent events. Regular Boston Globe columnist James Carroll offers a bitter critique: \"As perhaps the most savage crimes in history, the terrorists' acts [on September 11] should have been met with a swift, forceful response far more targeted than the present war has been. Police action, not war. The criminals, not an impoverished nation, should be on the receiving end of the punishment. Instead, a massive war against a substitute enemy leaves the sprawling criminal network intact - perhaps in Afghanistan, certainly in major cities elsewhere. Meanwhile, because of the war, the rule of law at home is being undermined. Because of the war-driven pressure to be 'united,' the shocking incompetence of US domestic security agencies goes unchallenged.\" A thoughtful leading article in the Chicago Tribune examines the role of Afghanistan's neighbours in backing competing factions. It concludes: \"Iran, Russia and Pakistan could cause trouble if they see the Taliban's demise as a chance to impose a client government in Kabul. That can't happen. The world was intent on using Afghanistan as a cold war battlefield for years. Now it has to be intent not on who controls Afghanistan, but on how Afghanistan controls itself.\" Canadian prime minister Jean Chreti\u00e9n is visiting Texas today. The Dallas Morning News takes the opportunity to heap praise on America's northern neighbour for its stand on and since September 11: \"Canada didn't just condemn the atrocious attacks on the United States. It unhesitatingly enlisted to defeat the people and countries that perpetrated them. It immediately opened its territory to commercial airplanes that were diverted from US airports, taking in 226 and their 33,000 passengers. It offered troops and treasure. Canadian warships and warplanes serve in the Afghan theatre of operations. And though Canadians haven't joined US and British troops in combat, they are ready to do so.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
