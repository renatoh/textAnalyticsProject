Gala launched its bid for the Spanish airline after its attempts to join BA's consortium were rebuffed this year. BA and the US buyout group Texas Pacific Group, backed by three Spanish private equity investors, are expected to lodge a bid next month after securing funding for their \u20ac3.4bn (\u00a32.4bn) indicative offer. However, the BA consortium will be under pressure to raise its offer of about \u20ac3.60 a share for the airline after Gala proposed between \u20ac3.60 and \u20ac3.90 a share. The Basque savings bank BBK and the chairman of the Spanish airline Air Europa are part of the Gala consortium, which is advised by Iberia's former chief executive Angel Mullor. Gala expects to make an offer in a month after conducting due diligence. It said Iberia would remain independent and under the same management. BA, which has 10% of Iberia, is backing the Texas Pacific consortium but will not raise its investment. Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said this month that the consortium was making \"good progress\". The biggest investors in the BA consortium will be three Spanish private equity firms: Vista Capital, Ibersuizas and Quercus Equity. They will control 51% of Iberia if the bid succeeds, to meet a government requirement that the airline does not fall into foreign majority control. Shares in British Airways closed down 9.5p, or 2.6%, at 359.25p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
