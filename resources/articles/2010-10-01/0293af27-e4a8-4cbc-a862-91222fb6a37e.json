Recorded live in Cleveland in February, Boulez and Pierre-Laurent Aimard make a combination that's almost equally formidable, though, especially in the left-handed work, where Boulez conjures up all the serpentine hues of the orchestral writing magnificently and Aimard gives a savage edge to the solo part. They are perhaps not so convincing in the G major concerto \u2013 Aimard's playing does not have quite the range of colour and gradations of touch that Zimerman, and before him Michelangeli (on EMI), bring to the piano writing, nor the infectious energy of Argerich's performance with Abbado (DG again). It's a distinguished disc, however \u2013 easily the most convincing of the three Boulez releases of this autumn \u2013 and Aimard completes it with the set of Miroirs, beautifully tooled and moulded, if just lacking a little in warmth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
