In a report on \"tier one\" visas, which cover investors, talented and highly skilled workers, John Vine discloses that a backlog of more than 9,000 applications for \"entrepreneur visas\" built up after the \"post-study work route\" was closed in April 2012. Vine said this backlog had been reduced by 70% by July this year to 3,445 outstanding applications. But more than a third of decisions to allow these \"entrepreneurs\" to stay in Britain were unreasonable, he said: \"It means that some individuals may have been allowed to enter or remain in the UK who should have been refused.\" The number of entrepreneur applications rose 1,520% between February and December last year after the closure of the scheme that allowed overseas graduates to apply for work when their studies had finished. The chief inspector said the resulting backlog peaked in March this year at 9,191 outstanding applications and the lack of foresight meant that there was insufficient staff to deal with them. \"While the Home Office had reduced this by over 70% by late July, it must ensure that dealing with these applications is not achieved at the expense of decision quality,\" said Vine. \"It must also improve its internal forecasting so that it can allocate resources effectively to prevent future backlogs.\" He reported that only 61% of the decisions taken of a sample of 1,682 entrepreneur cases in the 12 months to April 2012 could be described as reasonable. Many of the other 39% lacked evidence that the applicants had the funds they claimed to back them, he said. This compares with 91% of \"reasonable\" decisions taken on 594 applications under the separate investor route over a similar period. Vine also revealed that some of those who had applied to live and work in Britain under tier one of the points based system had to wait an average of 63 days for a decision on their applications, despite paying standard visa fees of more than \u00a31,000. The delays experienced by those whose applications were determined by staff in Sheffield compared with an average wait of only 7.5 days for similar applications decided at the Home Office's overseas post in New York."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
