If you're looking for a bargain farmhouse ruin, a select bottle of champers or snail-based snack product, the show has hundreds of stalls offering such delights, plus travel deals, seminars and celebrity-chef antics. Tickets are \u00a39 per adult in advance (0870 902 0444). Throughout the week, London hotels will offer French meals and classic French film packages, (Amelie at One Aldwych and A Bout de Souffle at the new Court House Hotel), and participating restaurants across the UK will offer French-themed menus. Competitions to find Britain's best young fashion designer, young artist and mature watercolourist are in swing, and top patisserie chef Eric Lanland will demonstrate his skills in Divertiment's cookery school, London. All details can be found at www.frenchweek.com, and read our special French issue of Escape next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
