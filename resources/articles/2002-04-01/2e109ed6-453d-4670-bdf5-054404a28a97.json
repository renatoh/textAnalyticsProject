The project opened a fascinating new chapter in interplanetary exploration. The atlas constructed from the surface probings of the Vikings' instruments ended a century of speculation about whether the planet had once supported civilised life. A picture emerged of a cold, dry desert, whose plains were strewn with rocks and sand dunes. The spacecraft's colour cameras showed a rusty-red, iron-rich terrain, and a reddish-yellow sky from its high dust content. Deep canyons, tall mountains, and a network of tributaries suggested that tectonic and volcanic activity, and water and wind erosion, had shaped the landscape over millennia. These findings were the signpost for Martin's successors, designing the next generation of robotic spacecraft to the red planet. Martin was born in Washington, and graduated in aeronautical engineering from Michigan University in 1942. He worked for 20 years at Republic Aviation, rising from assistant chief technical engineer to manager of space systems requirements. In 1964, he was recruited to the Nasa research centre, at Langley, Virginia, as assistant manager for the Lunar Orbiter project. This was a politically critical time for the American space programme, bedevilled by splits about the best way to recover the lead in space exploration from the Soviet Union. There were fundamental differences between the US government's principal science policy advisory group, the advanced projects research agency, the US air force and army, the jet propulsion laboratory (JPL, Nasa's premier centre for solar system exploration and first successful space- craft designer) and Nasa HQ. The argument came down to a choice between lunar and planetary exploration. With the Soviet Union having flown a spacecraft close to the moon, Nasa gave top priority to a lunar investigation by robotic spacecraft, whereas JPL wanted to send probes to Mars and Venus. In 1963, Nasa decided on the Lunar Orbiter project as a scientific study supporting the Apollo manned space programme. The Langley centre was asked to develop five reconnaissance spacecraft to send back one-metre resolution photographs and other data about the moon's surface, from which to plan Apollo landing sites. From the first launch in 1966, all five lunar obiters developed by Martin's group succeeded, providing lunar surface maps of unprecedented detail, and giving flight operators experience of tracking spacecraft in orbit around the moon. For this achievement, Martin was awarded Nasa's exceptional service medal in 1967. That same year, following new concern about catching up with the Soviet Venera 4 landing on Venus, the US government allocated more money for interplanetary space science. The result was collaboration between Martin's Langley team and the JPL on the Viking mission to send two orbiter-lander pairs to Mars for $415m. The lander's sophisticated computer, and biology gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer instruments, led the costs to escalate eventually to $1bn. But the returns made up for the price. Viking 1 functioned on Mars for 6 years - far longer than expected - and Viking 2 for 3 years. Their success set the stage for further Mars missions, including those of Pathfinder, Sojourner, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey. The Viking flights contained a fascinating illustration of how, with the high costs of space exploration, science and politics become closely intertwined. When Viking 1 began photographing the Martian surface for a landing site, the pictures showed the choices of earlier landing sites to be littered with craters, depressions, grooves and ridges. This dismayed the Viking team, who had hoped to make the first landing on July 4 1976, the bicentennial of the declaration of independence. But they had to delay it while they found a suitable site. Martin left Langley in 1976 to become vice-president for advanced programmes and planning at Marietta Aerospace. Nasa coaxed him out of retirement for a time in 2000 to supervise an overhaul of its Mars exploration programme. His wife Frieda, and a son and daughter, survive him.
