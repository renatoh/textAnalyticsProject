However, for a time I dabbled with a bizarre off shoot, 3 Nc3, sometimes named after the 19th-century Irish-American player James Mason (though he seems to have played it just once and lost), sometimes after Paul Keres (though he was once checkmated with it in just 12 moves ). 3\u2026 Qh4+ is obvious and good. White is forced to play 4 Ke2, blocking his king's bishop, and, crucially, losing the right to castle. However, there's method in this madness. White will gain time against the queen on the next turn by playing Nf3, and can build a strong centre with d4. To refute White's idea Black must play with energy and some accuracy. The outrageousness of this gambit appealed to the King family, but I ditched it when my opponents got too strong. My brother, nowadays an occasional but enthusiastic online player, has continued playing the opening, apparently with some success. His opponents often cop out of the queen check and play 3\u2026 g5, appropriate with a knight on f3, but here disastrous. 4 h4! breaks up the kingside pawns and leaves White, after moves such as d4, Bxf4 and Bc4, with a beautiful attacking position. It's a classic case of how an unusual opening can throw stereotyped players. In serious competition, the gambit has always had mixed results \u2014 to put it kindly \u2014 but as a surprise weapon it has claimed some calps. The player of the black pieces in this encounter is International Master strength and is about to get mated spectacularly. White sacrifi ced his second rook with 1 Be2! Qxh1 2 Bg4+ f5 3 Bxf5+ Kc7 4 Qa7+ Kd8 5 Qxb8+ Ke7 6 Qxd6+ Kf7 7 Qe6+ Kg7 8 Be5+, and mate follows shortly. This concludes our gambit series \u2014 for the time being. Feedback has been so enthusiastic that we will no doubt revisit the theme ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
