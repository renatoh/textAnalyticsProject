It\u2019s not only the state of Myanmar that is on trial here, it\u2019s our collective humanity that is being put on trial.\u201d Before dawn on Tuesday, a long queue had formed outside the Peace Palace in the Dutch city to witness the first of three days of hearings that will focus attention on military clearance operations in 2017 against the Rohingya Muslim minority, 700,000 of whom were forced to flee across the border to neighbouring Bangladesh. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s state counsellor and effective prime minister, is expected to defend her country\u2019s military on Wednesday by arguing that the operations were a legitimate counter-terrorism response to attacks by Rohingya militants. Her decision to fly to the Netherlands has proven popular in Myanmar, a mainly Buddhist country that considers the Rohingya to be in the country illegally and denies them citizenship. She has the status of official \u201cagent\u201d for Myanmar at the hearing, meaning she is the designated leader of her country\u2019s delegation. On Tuesday, she sat in the front row, her hands resting on a table. As a list of atrocities was read out, she stared ahead at the raised bank of judges in front of her, her face expressionless. With accusations accumulating, her body appeared to tense and her rapidly blinking eyes glanced occasionally up towards the courtroom\u2019s stained glass windows and chandeliers. The case has been brought by the Gambia, a predominantly Muslim west African state that alleges Myanmar has breached the 1948 genocide convention enacted after the Holocaust. The Gambia\u2019s claim states that Myanmar has perpetrated \u201cmanifest\u201d contraventions of the convention through the acts of its military, and continues to do so. Those acts, the court was told, included \u201cextrajudicial killings, rape or other forms of sexual violence, burning of homes and destruction of livestock \u2026 calculated to bring about a destruction of the Rohingya group in whole or in part\u201d. Detailing events at the village of Min Gyi, the Gambia\u2019s lawyer Andrew Loewenstein drew on witness accounts recorded in a report by UN investigators, who estimated 750 people were killed there, including more than 100 children under the age of six. \u201cThere were dead bodies on the floor; young boys from our village,\u201d Loewenstein quoted from one survivor\u2019s testimony to the UN fact-finding mission. \u201cAs we entered the house, the soldiers locked the door. One soldier raped me. He stabbed me in the back of my neck and in my abdomen. I was trying to save my baby, who was only 28 days old, but they threw him on the ground and he died.\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s alleged personal responsibility for the military\u2019s clearance operations was raised by Paul Reichler, a US lawyer speaking on behalf of the Gambia. He showed the court a photograph of billboards that appeared across Myanmar in which she featured in front of three leading generals above the caption \u201cWe stand with you\u201d. \u201cThis shows \u2013 it can only have been intended to show \u2013 that they are all in it together and that Myanmar has absolutely no intention of holding its emboldened military leadership to account,\u201d Reichler said. Prof Philippe Sands QC, the last lawyer to make submissions for the Gambia, told the ICJ that it was \u201cthe ultimate guardian of the [1948] genocide convention; it\u2019s on you the eyes of the world are turned\u201d. Sands quoted from the UN fact-finding mission which said Aung San Suu Kyi had not used her \u201cde facto power or moral authority to stem or prevent the unfolding events or to protect the civilian population\u201d. Among those in court were several Rohingya survivors who had flown in from Kutupalong refugee camp, the largest in Bangladesh outside Cox\u2019s Bazar. Hamida Khatun, Yousuf Ali and Hasina Begum were supported by the human rights organisation Legal Action Worldwide, which was founded by a former UN investigator of the violence, Antonia Mulvey. \u201cThis is a momentous occasion. They have travelled a long way to be here,\u201d Mulvey said outside the court. \u201cThey are seeking justice and this is the first and most important step. \u201cAung San Suu Kyi did nothing to stop the killing. She could have asked for help from the international community at the time. And now, as the final insult, she\u2019s defending the army\u2019s behaviour in court.\u201d Khatun, 50, is a leader of the Shanti Mohila, a group of 400 Rohingya women in the Kutupalong camp. Her family and friends were murdered in the 2017 military operations. Begum, 22, was attacked by soldiers; and Ali, 46, was beaten and sexually tortured by police in detention because he was accused of supporting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which the Myanmar army describes as a terrorist organisation. Once internationally feted as a human rights champion, Aung San Suu Kyi has experienced a rapid fall from grace over what the UN has called her \u201ccomplicity\u201d in the military clearances. The contrast has been repeatedly drawn between her 1991 Nobel peace prize win and 15 years spent under house arrest, and her present position. Among Rohingya protesters who gathered opposite the court was Rafique Mohammed, 33. His family fled Myanmar when he was a child and he now lives in Ireland. In 2012, he accompanied his niece to Dublin airport where she presented Aung San Suu Kyi, then at the height of her international renown, with flowers. \u201cWe are horribly disappointed in her,\u201d he said. \u201cMy uncle was shot dead in 2017. We are here for justice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
