The American came on as a substitute and should have equalised in the 77th minute after Jack Rodwell picked him out with a pass to the far post. It would have been a just result for an Everton side who dominated the second half after being outplayed in the first. \"Landon said sorry to us afterwards,\" said the midfielder Mikel Arteta. And Donovan himself said: \"This is just a really disappointing moment for me personally. I've put a lot into my time here and another goal would have been a nice reward. \"I got myself in a good position at the back post and was hoping Jack was going to put the ball across goal. He did that and it came perfectly for me. It's hard to understand what went wrong. I felt like everything was right but then I looked up to see the ball had hit the side-netting. It's so frustrating because if we had scored then it's possible we might have gone on to win the game.\" Everton's manager, David Moyes, who sank to his knees and clutched his head in despair, at least found some consolation in the performance of the defender Phil Jagielka, who is returning to full fitness after a serious knee injury. Although Jagielka only came on as a substitute his form will interest England's manager, Fabio Capello, in view of the number of defenders who are injured or in poor form. \"Phil made a massive difference when he came on against Spurs,\" Moyes said. \"On his day he's a really top defender. He's probably not ready for 90 minutes yet. But if he plays like he did against Spurs he's not far away [from England].\" Everton captain's, Phil Neville, also praised Jagielka's performance when he said: \"He was probably a catalyst for that second-half performance. It's great to have him back as he is a real voice around the place. He probably only trained 10 or 15 days and that shows what a character he is.\" Meanwhile Tottenham's manager, Harry Redknapp, who was upset to see the midfielder Tom Huddlestone added to an already lengthy injury list, has found consolation in the form of Luka Modric, who himself has had to recover from a fractured leg. Redknapp said: \"I think Luka is back to his best; he could play in any team in the world. His goal against Everton was a fantastic finish from a great player.\" The Spurs midfielder Niko Kranjcar, Modric's international team-mate with Croatia, added: \"I think he proved it when he came on at Wigan and was sublime. Against Everton, again he had a great game. Since we started playing together in the national team I think the team benefits from us playing together and we get the best out of each other.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
