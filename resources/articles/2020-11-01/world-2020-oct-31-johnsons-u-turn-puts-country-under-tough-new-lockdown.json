With immediate warnings of the grave economic fallout and a mounting backlash among Tory MPs, the prime minister announced that a series of measures would come into force on Thursday to combat growing Covid infections. They will remain in place until 2 December. Under the new measures non-essential shops and venues, as well as pubs and restaurants, will be closed. Schools, colleges and universities will remain open. The public will be told only to leave home for specific reasons, such as work if they cannot work from home, to shop for food and essentials, exercise, medical appointments or caring for the vulnerable. The vulnerable and those over 60 are being advised to be especially careful and minimise their social contacts, but there will be no return of a formal request to shield themselves. Government insiders said the \u201ctime-limited\u201d measures would then see a return to a regionalised approach. In another major reversal, the original furlough scheme under which the state paid 80% of workers\u2019 wages will be extended for the duration of the new lockdown. Ministers had been resisting an extension of the scheme. The move angered regional leaders who had been pleading for extra support for weeks. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, said the Treasury had refused to extend furlough when Wales\u2019 \u201cfirebreak\u201d lockdown began. At a press conference, the prime minister said that he had decided to reimpose a national lockdown because \u201cwe could see deaths running at several thousand a day\u201d. The virus, he said \u201cis spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario of our scientific advisers\u201d. He added: \u201cThe risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families.\u201d His chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said the data painted \u201ca very grim picture\u201d. Deaths over the winter, he warned, could be \u201ctwice as bad or more than the first wave\u201d. The government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had called for a \u201cshort period of lockdown\u201d five and a half weeks ago, but was rebuffed. At that stage, the UK was averaging 4,964 new cases per day, with 1,502 Covid patients in hospital and 28 deaths. Yesterday, there were 21,915 more cases across the UK, more than 10,000 Covid patients in hospital and 326 deaths. Johnson said he still believed a regional approach had been \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d. However, he said the government had to be \u201chumble in the face of nature\u201d. He said that taking no further action would lead to the NHS being overwhelmed, with doctors and nurses being forced to choose \u201cwho would live and who would die\u201d. \u201cChristmas is going to be different this year, perhaps very different,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s my sincere hope that by taking tough action now we can allow families across the country to be together.\u201d He said while the lockdown was not as strict as in the spring, the \u201cbasic message is the same: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d The move comes less than two weeks after Johnson accused Labour of attempting to \u201cturn the lights out\u201d following Keir Starmer\u2019s endorsement of a circuit-breaker lockdown timed to overlap with half term. It is also an admission that the three-tier system in England, designed to contain local outbreaks, has failed . Starmer said that the government\u2019s delay in imposing a lockdown will come \u201cat an economic cost and a human cost\u201d and that the government had resisted scientific calls for it since September. He said it was unfair to pretend to the public that Christmas \u201cwill be normal\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think Christmas will be normal and I think we need to level with the public on that,\u201d he said. Johnson revealed the measures after presenting his cabinet with dire data warning that the NHS could surpass its fixed and surge bed capacity by the first week of December, even after elective procedures are cancelled. Ministers were told the growth in this virus is national, and quicker in areas with lower case rates. A Commons vote on the measures will be held on Wednesday. Tory MPs are demanding an urgent improvement of the test-and-trace system to ensure the \u201cnightmare\u201d of the new measures is not needed again. There is also private anger among the government\u2019s scientific advisers, who say that concerns about exceeding the reasonable worst-case scenarios had been known about for weeks. Insiders expressed concerns about the government\u2019s unwillingness to do anything seen as unpopular, adding that restrictions now had to be more severe and longer than would have been the case with earlier action. Ministers are already being warned a second national lockdown would hit the economy with the same force as the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Industry experts said retailers and hospitality businesses, many already teetering on the brink, would join a growing queue of businesses filing for bankruptcy without further government support. The TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe extension of the furlough scheme is long overdue and necessary, but ministers must do more to protect jobs and prevent poverty.\u201d Thousands of self-employed were said to be facing \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d without more support, according to the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said health service figures had been dismayed by the handling of the new lockdown plans. He said NHS trust leaders learning of the lockdown plans from newspaper reports had concluded the government\u2019s actions were \u201cnot quick enough, decisive or clear\u201d. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College London professor whose modelling still informs the government, said urgent research was taking place into whether schools and universities could continue to function as at present, given the role teenagers could be playing in the transmission of the virus. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were now facing a \u201cnightmare before Christmas\u201d, adding that there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d in which any retail premises should have to close in a second national lockdown. \u201cIt will cause untold damage to the high street in the run-up to Christmas, cost countless jobs, and permanently set back the recovery of the wider economy, with only a minimal effect on the transmission of the virus,\u201d she said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a senior figure on Sage who had pushed for additional measures, said that the lockdown was right and warned that the lockdown should probably be imposed for the next two months. \u201cIf we can steel ourselves now for a few weeks of greater restrictions, there\u2019s a chance we could ease up a little between Christmas and new year without the virus getting out of control,\u201d he said yesterday. Many scientists remained angry that the government has taken so long in heeding their advice. \u201cYet again, the UK has been slow to act and delayed decisive action until the last moment,\u201d said Stephen Griffin, associate professor at Leeds University\u2019s School of Medicine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
