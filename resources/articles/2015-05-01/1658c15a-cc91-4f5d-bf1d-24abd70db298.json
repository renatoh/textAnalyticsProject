And the result is chaos.\u201d While most of the policy prescriptions Rubio made on Wednesday \u2013 arm the Ukrainian military, pull back from negotiations with Iran, increase air strikes in Iraq, increase naval activity in the China Sea, reverse the \u201cnormalization\u201d of relations with Cuba \u2013 were hawkish in nature, on the most hotly contested foreign policy issue of the last decade \u2013 the Iraq war \u2013 the candidate seemed to reverse himself in the direction of restraint. During his run for the US Senate in Florida in 2010 Rubio was asked whether the Iraq war had made the United States \u201csafer and better off\u201d. \u201cI think ultimately yes,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cbecause Saddam Hussein is no longer in charge.\u201d Rubio seemed to contradict that view on Wednesday when moderator Charlie Rose asked whether he would have been in favor of the Iraqi invasion \u201cafter finding out that there were no weapons of mass destruction\u201d. \u201cNot only would I not have been in favor of it, President [George W] Bush would not have been in favor of it,\u201d Rubio replied. \u201cAnd he said so. President Bush has said that he regrets that the intelligence was faulty. I don\u2019t think Congress would have voted in favor of the authorization if they didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Likely Rubio presidential opponent Jeb Bush had told a questioner days earlier that \u201cknowing what we know now\u201d, he still \u201cwould have\u201d authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq had he been president. Bush later said he had misunderstood the question. The relatively measured talk on Iraq was the exception, however, in Rubio\u2019s appearance Wednesday, which he otherwise used to sharply condemn a White House foreign policy that he characterized as too passive and \u201cunhinged from its moral purpose\u201d. The speech fed perceptions that Rubio, who recently backed an amendment that would have crippled the Iran nuclear negotiations and who vehemently opposes the \u201cnormalization\u201d of relations with Cuba, has raised the temperature of his foreign policy views in recent months, possibly with an eye on the proclivities of Republican primary voters. In the world view Rubio outlined Wednesday, which he billed as a new doctrine, certain regional conflicts that look very difficult \u2013 the ongoing war in Syria, the failed state of Libya \u2013 in fact began as tractable problems that spun out of control due to tragic US negligence. Other regional conflicts that look very difficult, meanwhile \u2013 the demise of a two-state solution for Israel-Palestine, for example \u2013 Rubio presented as every bit as confounding as they seem, with the United States powerless to act. \u201cMost threatening of all,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cwe have seen Iran expand its influence throughout the Middle East, and threaten to annihilate Israel, as it moves closer to a nuclear weapon capability. The president\u2019s proposed deal with Iran will likely lead to a cascade of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, and it could force Israel to take bold action to defend itself, making war with Iran even more likely.\u201d Rubio offered a similar prescription for flashpoints in Ukraine, the Gulf and the Pacific, describing a need for gestures that would demonstrate a US willingness to defend its interests with military might. Such a gesture might be directed at China, which Rubio accused of arrogating territory near Japan and the Philippines. \u201cWe should never accept it as a truth that they control that,\u201d Rubio said, referring to artificial islands built by the Chinese. \u201cAnd I would in fact take all sorts of naval actions \u2013 not military actions, per se \u2013 but military naval vessels transiting through that zone, to clearly show this is international waters, open to transit to anyone who wants to go through there.\u201d Rubio called for increasing airstrikes against Isis militants in Iraq, to be supported on the ground by a \u201cpan-Arab Sunni force\u201d including troops supplied by Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who to many eyes appears to be the kind of \u201cpro-American dictator\u201d that Rubio dismissed as an \u201coxymoron\u201d in his last outing before the council on foreign relations, in 2012. \u201cI still think that it\u2019s good we\u2019re conducting air strikes \u2013 the truth is that we probably need more\u201d in Iraq, Rubio said Wednesday. \u201cBut I really think it\u2019s critical that a Sunni force confront them on the ground, and part of that can be Iraqi Sunnis, and I see today that they\u2019re starting to train some, but I also think it\u2019s important to go to our allies in the region \u2013 the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the GCC countries \u2013 that are willing to also put forces on the ground to help stabilize that country.\u201d Rubio took particular aim at Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and presidential contender on the Democratic side, calling her the \u201cchief architect and spokesperson of a foreign policy that will go down in history as disastrous\u201d. \u201cWe simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cA leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best, and dangerously negligent at worst.\u201d Rubio denied an assertion by Rose that his intensifying proximity as a presidential candidate to mega-donors such as Sheldon Adelson, the staunch supporter of Israel and opponent of a two-state solution, had pulled him in a hawkish direction. \u201cMy interest in Israel is not about the people who will support me politically,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt\u2019s a longstanding belief.\u201d Asked whether he considered Iran as dangerous as Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu seems to, Rubio replied: \u201cI view them as the same threat he does. The difference is, he lives a lot closer to them than I do.\u201d After Rubio concluded his prepared remarks, Rose asked him: \u201cShould we be the world\u2019s policeman?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the role that I would advocate,\u201d Rubio replied. \u201cThe title is not world policeman.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
