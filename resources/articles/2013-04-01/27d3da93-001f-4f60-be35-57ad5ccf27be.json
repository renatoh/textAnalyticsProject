The catch-up campaign is aimed at 10-to-14-year-olds who as babies either had only the first of the two shots of the combined measles, mumps and rubella jab, or neither. It is aimed at vaccinating nearly 1m children as they get older, mix more and are more likely to come into contact with the disease. Measles has swept through Swansea in south Wales. Immunisation rates have dropped as low as 70% in parts of London and south-west England \u2013 when 95% is necessary to prevent measles outbreaks. Unvaccinated children are at risk of the measles virus, which is one of the most infectious in the world. Public Health England said there were 587 confirmed cases of measles in England in the first three months of this year, with the greatest number in the 10-to-14-year age group. That is three times more than the same quarter of 2012, the year with the highest number of cases (1,902) since the MMR booster was introduced in 1996. At the campaign launch Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said: \"The situation in Swansea, I believe, is a wake-up call for parents who, for whatever reason, quite a few years ago chose not to vaccinate their children and for whom vaccinations are these days not things they think about very much. But what is happening in Swansea could happen anywhere in England. \"You can catch measles but you can't catch up with measles \u2013 it is a forlorn exercise. We have to prevent measles. We have to get ahead before we have huge numbers of cases and huge outbreaks in England.\" Most parents are thought to have stayed away from clinics because of alarm at the now discredited research of Andrew Wakefield, the gastroenterologist, who hypothesised a link between the MMR and autism in 1998. Wakefield has been struck off the medical register and is now in the US. Vaccination rates among babies at 13 months and boosters for toddlers at three and-a-half years are now high once more \u2013 at over 90% \u2013 as public confidence returns. Public Health England hopes that if that can be maintained, measles may be effectively eliminated from the UK as it was prior to 2001. The three areas of England which have had the highest numbers of cases are the north-east, north-west and London. Vaccination rates in children born between 1997 and 2003 were low in those areas. So far this year, there have been 179 cases of measles in the north-west, 175 in the north-east and 67 in London. The worst years for MMR take-up were 2001-2007, said Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation for Public Health England, \"at the time of the worst publicity in relation to the MMR\". The numbers are not as high as in south Wales \u2013 although comparisons are difficult because the demands of the outbreak have caused officials to stop lab testing, so the Welsh cases will not all be confirmed. As many as a third may not be measles after all. Authorities in Wales are investigating whether a private clinic chain is breaking the law by offering single injection alternatives to the triple measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The healthcare inspectorate in Wales is examining the role of the Children's Immunisation Centre, a Cheshire-based company that operates from a number of sites in England and has offered measles jabs in Swansea at a cost of \u00a3110 plus \u00a350 prescription fee. It is not registered to operate in Wales. As the total number of suspected measles cases in Swansea nears 900 and tests continue into whether the disease has claimed its first fatality in the UK for five years, Public Health Wales, the body co-ordinating the response to the epidemic, has asked the centre to substantiate claims it makes on its website as regards the efficacy of the vaccine. Regarding England, Ramsay said: \"We are concerned. We have this legacy of older children who were not vaccinated as toddlers and they are now of secondary school age, when they can spread infection very efficiently. There is no routine opportunity for them to be vaccinated again.\" There were particular worries about parts of London and the south-east, where the legacy of the MMR scare had left more unvaccinated children than in the north, she added. GPs will be asked to check their records for unvaccinated children, who will be invited to the surgery for a catch-up jab. Local authorities, who have responsibility for public health, will also be involved and there will be clinics in schools. As well as parents, children aged 10-14 are being urged to take the initiative themselves if they know or suspect they were not vaccinated. A Facebook page is being launched, as well as the Twitter tag #getthemmr. Children who have received one dose of MMR have 95% protection from measles, say experts, but some of them will still be at risk. Some children were given single vaccines rather than MMR against government advice, but may not have received the whole course. Their families should seek an appointment with their GP, said Salisbury. \"If your child has had six doses of single vaccines and you know the quality of the vaccines and the way in which they were stored, your child does not require more vaccine, but if you can't answer those questions, you should go to your GP for a dose of MMR. It won't do any harm to a child who is already immune to have a dose of MMR.\" A previous MMR catch-up campaign in 2008 was not thought to be particularly successful, but Salisbury said the new one would be better co-ordinated, higher profile and would also work more effectively to identify those children who missed out on vaccination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
