Our roving (Rovering?) reporter, Martin Plimmer, went along to Alicia and Bill Eykyn\u2019s Featherbed Country Club for Dogs in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire \u2013 where pets can stay for \u00a3125 a week, or \u00a3265 in today\u2019s money (or to put it another way, four times as much as my student room cost at the time) \u2013 to find out about this piece of \u2018canine heaven\u2019. Though that\u2019s if they get past the \u2018gruelling\u2019 24-hour vetting service \u2013 a one-night trial for which owners will have to stump up \u00a325. \u2018Candidates have to satisfy Mrs Eykyn,\u2019 writes Plimmer, \u2018who has a marked bias towards neutered males, that they have other things on their mind than sex and doing not very nice things on furniture.\u2019 Rooms that dogs can stay in include the Dynasty room, which has a round bed, the Dallas suite, with chandelier and four-poster bed, and the Barbara Cartland room, which was such a disturbing shade of shocking pink that they had to tone it down. \u2018Short of living with Brigitte Bardot,\u2019 reckons our man, \u2018a dog couldn\u2019t wish for a more sublime existence.\u2019 Mrs Timms will groom them; Alison will bring them their room-service snacks. \u2018Some members require ice cream, cups of tea or toast,\u2019 writes Plimmer, \u2018and, in one case, seven regular daily feeds of mozzarella and mortadella.\u2019 Some lessons perhaps for Britannia hotels, just voted the worst hotel chain for the seventh year in a row. Damning with faint praise, he says that the Eykyns\u2019 own dog, Mungo, has the \u2018nonchalant self-importance of the top roadie at a Barry Manilow concert, with access to all areas\u2019. I wonder whether he was thinking what I was, that Manilow, in his 80s pomp, was a dead ringer for an Afghan hound?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
