Drummer Laura Harris and bassist Betsy Wright join Timony for a power trio that seems intent on celebrating and rejuvenating some of rock\u2019s enduring pleasures: here are 12 succinct, speedy, riff-happy gems smothered in snarling backtalk and shameless, glorious guitar solos. Ex Hex sit somewhere near the middle of a Go-gos/Ramones/Sleater-Kinney Venn diagram, and join latterday power-pop aces like Warm Soda, the Love Triangle and Sheer Mag in making some of the most endlessly repeat-listenable should-be-hits of recent years. From the hurtling clang of Beast; to How You Got That Girl\u2019s gleaming, twirling chorus; to New Kid, with its whiplashing pickslides and turbo-booster solo \u2013 these songs will be echoing in your ears long after Rips\u2019 lean, mean 35 mins are over, and very welcome they will be there, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
