Yet James's complicated explorations of American innocents (supposed) and their European corrupters (assumed) is strongly brought to mind in Moorhouse's duo of novels about the interwar activities of the League of Nations, of which Dark Palace is the concluding part. Edith Campbell Berry, a young Australian science graduate of pioneer stock, comes to Europe to work in Geneva for the newly established League soon after the first world war. Her adventures are the substance of Grand Days, Dark Palace 's predecessor. In the new novel it is 1931, and the League is already beginning to crack up. The United States has never joined, Japan is invading Manchuria, and the idea of sanctions is about to be born. Thereafter, for 650 pages, Moorhouse charts the steady decline of international idealism in the face of encroaching of fascism, nazism, isolationism and appeasement. The last part of the book is devoted to the League's ghost-life during the second world war. Final disillusionment comes when the survivors are all but excluded from the conference which establishes the United Nations in San Francisco in 1946. Russians and Americans alike have lost any appetite for disarmament and pacifism. Moorhouse handles these historical events with virtuosity. He is especially adroit at mixing real-life people with his invented characters. To have Edith talking convincingly with Anthony Eden, Pierre Laval, Enoch Powell (in an interlude back in Sydney where Powell is a young university lecturer) and James Joyce is a considerable achievement. Even more admirable is the natural way Moorhouse builds up readers' anxiety that the League should succeed, and caps their disappointment at the way the \"low dishonest decade\" of the 1930s destroys all hope of peace and rule of law. The fall of Paris, bringing about a treacherous change of heart in Avenol, the French deputy director of the League, is the dramatic highlight of Moorhouse's narrative. However, it is the Jamesian tone that remains Dark Palace 's chief adornment, though Edith is no Isobel Archer. She is shown as someone able to hold her own with European sophisticates, and, more originally, as an embodiment of how far morality has moved since the 19th century made its easy identification of the dichotomy of innocence and corruption as the received way of presenting encounters between the new world and the old. The League, as well as the people caught up in it, demonstrate for Moorhouse that human frailty is independent of country of origin. He deserves particular praise for eschewing any notion of Australia as a new-found land free of traditional duplicity. Nobody now, he suggests, comes to Europe to have his or her idealism exposed or exploited. Henry James let such doubts show in his confrontations between old and new, but he was wedded of necessity to a starker, if richer, opposition. Today, the stain is universal. Dark Palace is also a love story, and a voluptuous one. In Grand Days Edith meets two British officers, survivors of the trenches. She becomes the lover of the first and the wife of the second. They are very different sorts of men. Ambrose is suave, intelligent, a master of good taste, and possesses a sardonic humour. He is also a cross-dresser, a lover of women and men alike, and unashamedly at home in female underwear and night attire. Robert is a journalist, forever following disasters across new frontiers. He is straight, but he offers Edith less satisfaction than Ambrose does. This is the sexual imbroglio, but it is shown as mattering less than the ordering of love in Edith's life. Moorhouse presents Ambrose's ambiguous nature and that of Edith herself, a more determinedly heterosexual person, as coordinates of the quest for true love. He outfaces all assumptions that such a thing could not coexist with transvestism. In Geneva, those on the side of \"good\" are bizarre, while the \"wicked\" are orthodox and unimaginative. Plans to save Jewish refugees and keep the flag of liberalism flying in Switzerland are plotted at the Molly Club, chosen relaxation point for Geneva's queer community. But Moorhouse is not purveying any sort of upside-down morality. His handling of sexual conduct, from self-pleasuring to fetishism, is uncensorious but also without illusions. He understands that in life, love stories can bear a great deal of reality. At the novel's end, Edith and Ambrose have nowhere to go. The world, of course, has watched the United Nations fail almost as disastrously as the League did. I hope Moorhouse will take a deep breath and send Edith and Ambrose into the field again to treat the horror stories surrounding Korea, Suez, Hungary, the Berlin Wall - all the way to the Twin Towers. They'll be very old, but Dark Palace suggests that they have the stamina for it. \u00b7 Peter Porter's most recent book of poems is Max Is Missing (Picador, \u00a37.99)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
