Lee Carsley.\" Recognition will have to wait. This club has seen so many apparent saviours come and go over recent years that it was perhaps apt that the latest big hope's initial impact should be tinged with farce. The mistake was soon corrected, the Tannoy operator acknowledging that Johnson and Carsley share similar pates if not pace or potency in front of goal, although the Republic of Ireland international still had to convince his three children watching in one of the lounges that he had not been the No8 singeing Watford. Everton needed this. It took them nine league games last term to score as many goals as they managed at their first attempt on Saturday, yet there was enough dash to their attacks here to suggest they will not be as shot-shy again. Johnson is key. \"We were a different Everton with him up front than we would have been last year,\" admitted David Moyes. \"Everybody can see he's bright, sharp and something's liable to happen when he gets the ball. We needed him today.\" It is some 18 months since the Everton chairman Bill Kenwright first contacted his opposite number at Crystal Palace, Simon Jordan, to inquire about the player's possible availability. The Evertonian was politely deflected at the time, although his \u00a38.6m eventually proved persuasive in June. Scoreless in six pre-season friendly matches, Johnson took 15 minutes to link with James Beattie, cushion a pass on his chest and see his sliced shot loop off Lloyd Doyley and over the stranded Ben Foster to choke the tedious chants of \"cheat\" from the away fans. Watford love to hate the 25-year-old, their antipathy born of a penalty won and converted last New Year's Eve. The Hornets had the last laugh in May with a resounding play-off victory over Palace, but Johnson still pursued them into the Premiership and tormented them here. He will benefit from the excellent Mikel Arteta's clever passing, the Spaniard duly converting from the spot after Tim Cahill's cross struck Chris Powell on the forehead and a penalty was awarded for hand-ball. The decision was ludicrous and ultimately cost Watford a point, even if Everton should have eased themselves clear with Arteta and Cahill both striking the woodwork in the first period. The penalty was awarded by the referee Peter Walton and not his assistant, who was better positioned. \"I'm still flabbergasted,\" said Powell. \"The assistant referees and the referee are supposed to be a team, but that's the first hand-ball that's been given against me when it's hit me on the head. But what can we do now?\" They can continue in the same vein. Watford may lack finesse, but they are horribly awkward opponents who, while still imbued with the confidence generated by last season's staggering success, could bustle their way to Premiership safety. Marlon King and Damien Francis may have missed excellent chances, but they made Everton's experienced back line quake at times. Francis eventually pierced the home side in stoppage-time, his shot cannoning off Alan Stubbs and in, although much now will depend upon Aidy Boothroyd's ability to cajole a ruthlessness from his side. \"We need to show a bit more composure at times but, if we do that, I can't see too many teams really holding out against us,\" added Powell, who joined Watford in June. \"I like the way the manager and this team go about their work.\" Watford lost their first game last season 2-1 to Preston and finished third. This time around, fourth bottom would do. Man of the match: Mikel Arteta (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
