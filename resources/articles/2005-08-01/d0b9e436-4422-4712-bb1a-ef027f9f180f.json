For more than 30 years its demise has been heralded: first through the miner's strikes of the Seventies and Eighties, which saw government confront a state-owned industry it believed to be inefficient, then through the dash for gas, which saw it displaced by cleaner, newer plants in the Nineties, and most recently through the adjustment of energy policies in the West (except, of course, for the US) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, coal now supplies around half as much of the UK's electricity as in 1990. But that is not the end of the story, in Britain or further afield. Here, for example, coal's contribution has increased since 2000. Then, it made up 30.9 per cent of electricity generation. In 2001, this jumped to 33.5 per cent, in 2002,was 31.5, in 2003 it peaked at 34.5, and last year was 33 per cent. The reason has been the spiralling cost of the natural gas used in gas-fired power stations. The price of oil has risen some 50 per cent this year and by 100 per cent since 2003. Simon Skillings of Powergen, the German-owned UK generator, says: 'Our coal-fired generation has increased from 2001/02, when gas prices were at their lowest, to much higher levels today.' The government line is that it expects coal to remain a significant contributor to Britain's energy needs for the foreseeable future, and that, as energy markets in the UK are open and competitive, the choice of energy source is for generators. But at what levels? With oil prices expected to remain high - if not at their current $60 a barrel levels - can coal expect to hang on to its share or even increase it? Several mitigating factors are emerging. First, the price of coal has risen considerably as global demand has increased, a factor that has been concerning energy companies, which have already had to pass on gas price increases several times to UK customers. The reasons for the global increase are not identical to those in the UK. Much of the demand has come from China and India, which have sucked in a lot of South African and South American supply - not because of the rise in gas prices, but because of raw industrial growth demanding greater output from all energy sources. Coal prices have gone from $34 a tonne in January 2002, peaking at $78 in July 2004. Gareth Davies, managing consultant at energy specialist Oxera, says: 'Coal prices have been very high, partly thanks to high demand globally and also high freight costs [also driven by Chinese industrial growth]. However, there seem to be signs that freight costs are slowing.' This may be a sign of slackening demand that could see the price come off. Skillings points out: 'Coal and freight prices have risen, but not by nearly as much as oil and gas.' But, as Davies observes, there are other factors. Part of Europe's response to Kyoto has been to introduce an emissions trading scheme where firms that use 'dirty' CO2-intensive electricity, and generators that make it, are penalised if they exceed an agreed limit. Carbon prices rose from around \u20ac7 a tonne to \u20ac30 since the inception of the 'grey' market last year and are now around \u20ac22.50. For a generator in the UK, the carbon cost of burning coal is two to three times greater than that of burning gas. Another factor is that, under European legislation, large coal plants must either install equipment that strips out sulphur and nitrogen emissions or have their operation limited between 2008 and 2015 to 20,000 hours before final closure. Skillings says Powergen will opt some of its plant into the scheme, but leave some out, committing to running it only for 20,000 hours. Davies says: 'If you take the scenario that climate change does not change in importance, you are not going to see coal becoming a major contributor in the medium term, unless you see a major improvement in clean coal technologies.' The last point is important. Ministers and analysts believe that a solution through 'carbon sequestration' - fitting plants to 'scrub out' CO2 from coal emissions, before piping them under pressure to underground reservoirs such as in the North Sea - is a key method of maintaining energy levels consistent with growth while hitting environmental targets. In such a scenario, coal remains an important part of the mix. Tony Grayling, of the IPPR think-tank, says: 'Carbon sequestration will have to be part of the solution to bringing down emissions.' The government recently launched a \u00a340m project to develop the technology, along with industrial partners such as BP. From a company perspective, the success of the technology, and the incentives to adopt it, will have a dramatic impact on the kind of generation in the UK by 2015. 'With old coal and nuclear plants coming offline after 2008, there will be a major need for new capacity. If we are clear that CO2 capture and storage will make sense, you could see new coal plants being built. Otherwise, what you will see is a massive increase in gas plants - with big exposure to price.' Perhaps the real significance of clean coal technology lies outside Europe. China, India and the US plan more than 800 new coal-fired power stations between now and 2012. The CO2 emitted by these is estimated to be five times the savings made by those adopting Kyoto. In that context, what happens in the UK is a mere puff of smoke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
