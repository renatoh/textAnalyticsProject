Born in Widnes, he attended Wade Deacon grammar school before studying engineering at Manchester University. He then worked for the Atomic Energy Authority at Windscale (now Sellafield) but in the mid 1950s, when his name moved towards the top of the list of \"volunteers\" to sort out a serious accident, he thought it was time to leave. He turned to copywriting in London, working for various agencies including Hobson's, Bloxham's, and Benton and Bowles, and lastly at the Thompson Organisation as copy chief, where he was involved with every available medium: press, TV, posters, mailshots and film. His first book, Travels of a Capitalist Lackey (1965), recounted his journey through Russia in a 1926 Alvis with his copywriting chum Paul Redfern. Deciding to write full-time, his Country Matters (1971) describes the adventures of a young Catholic man who leaves the north of England for London, determined to lose his virginity. Gropers, or a Splendid View of St. Pancras (1977) is about the inhabitants of an elegant but seedy house in an Islington square during the three-day week; it is interspersed with newspaper items and descriptive passages about Islington. Critical Mass (1998), a lightly fictionalised but dark comedy, is based on his time at Windscale. He had problems getting this book published, as few were willing to believe the cavalier way in which the nuclear industry was run in its early days. Before he died, he was working with Susie Norris, his partner of 35 years, on a design reference book. His work for the BBC included plays and talks. The last of these was a series based on Travels of a Capitalist Lackey, entitled Ten Thousand Miles on an Overdraft, broadcast in 1986. Fred could speak with enthusiasm across a wide spectrum of subjects. He was well read, and had a memory to match. A name here, a date there, or an apt quotation, and all of them instantly, as if the normal rhythm of his speech was a highly polished piece of prose. Engineering, physics, history, travel, languages, cinema, art, archaeology, design, gardening, novels, poetry; all of them seemed to come alike to Fred, to be explored and relished in equal measure. We usually met once a week, over a pint, another of Fred's great passions. He chose the venues carefully, but changed them immediately if the beer was anything less than perfect. He enjoyed company, but, if alone, was perfectly happy with a book or the Guardian crossword. \u00b7 Has someone you know died since November who should feature in Other lives?
