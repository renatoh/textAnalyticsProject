He scored the goal against Bristol Rovers to give his team a 2-1 win and a lead of six points, but he was then sent off for a clash with Kevin Austin which brought Austin the red card as well. The biggest surprise was Mansfield's 1-0 defeat against struggling Darlington . It was no fluke because, apart from the decisive goal by Matt Clarke, Darlington's Danny Graham hit the post twice and a Barry Conlon header struck the bar. Much water has passed under the bridge since Northampton Town 's 5-1 home defeat by Hull City in October - as they emphasised with their 3-2 win at Hull. Eric Sabin scored two Cobblers goals. The striker who is attracting the most interest is Scunthorpe United 's Steve MacLean, the leading scorer. MacLean, on loan to Scunthorpe from Rangers, scored his twenty-fourth goal for them in their 2-2 draw against Rochdale . In addition to Darlington, other teams at the bottom to get maximum points were Carlisle and Macclesfield .
