The documents contain a map that highlights the Australian hotspots where radicalisation is more likely to occur in Australia\u2019s two largest cities. Asio chief Duncan Lewis laid out the maps during a briefing with Abbott and justice minister Michael Keenan at an official event attended by journalists, photographers and camera operators on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a map which shows the two cities of Melbourne and Sydney, where fighters who\u2019ve gone off to the Middle East have emanated from, the home addresses if you like,\u201d Lewis told Abbott. \u201cNot surprisingly you see a concentration down here and up here in Melbourne, and then to the west of the city of Sydney over here.\u201d He went on to say that the maps would be effective in targeting the government\u2019s anti-radicalisation program. \u201cThis obviously will inform very much some of the work that needs to be done around that planning,\u201d Lewis said. An Asio spokesman admitted to the ABC on Wednesday that the documents were not for publication, marked \u201cofficial use only\u201d. Shadow assistant defence minister David Feeney wants urgent clarification on whether the documents were classified, adding that Labor never used \u201ctop-secret material as props\u201d. The timing is a major embarrassment for the government, coinciding with the introduction of national security laws that strip dual nationals of their Australian citizenship if they are accused of terrorism. \u201cHow can it be that the prime minister who tells us day after day that he\u2019s at the heart of a very serious security conversation ... can suddenly be in a meeting being appraised of sensitive material and not recognise it for the sensitive material that it is?\u201d Feeney asked reporters on Thursday. \u201cHow can his own instincts, which he tells us are very finely honed, not ring with alarm bells when being briefed with material that is secret in full view of our cameras?\u201d Liberal backbencher Craig Laundy, whose western Sydney seats takes in many of hotspots shown in the map, said he is aware of the problem of radicalisation. \u201cThis is a known issue,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWe know where these areas are... and this should be called for what it is, a beat up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
