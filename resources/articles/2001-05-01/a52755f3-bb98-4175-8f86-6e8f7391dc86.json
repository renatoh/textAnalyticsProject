At the Coliseum there is no sunny, gaudy setting; instead there's a neutral-coloured box of a stage, with the exaggerated perspective and pure spots of colour of a Fra Angelico fresco. Although this is Verdi's last and most autumnal opera, we bypass that season, heading straight into winter; the final scene opens with the gentle whirr of the snow machine. That's not to say that the humour is frozen out. Matthew Warchus, whose production is revived by Steven Stead, has brought the same sure comic touch to this as he did to Art. But the light is balanced by shade. Darker touches that can all too easily slip by in an Italian melee are made starkly apparent when sung in Amanda Holden's flowing English translation. These extremes are defined by Andrew Shore's hugely enjoyable - and enjoyably huge - performance as Falstaff. Shore seems at home in this role. His timing is spot-on, both in the comic one-liners and the sombre moments. When in the third act he sings \"I am growing old\", it resonates, amazingly, with the same kind of fearful self-realisation Strauss gives the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier; but before the mood becomes too unsettling, a pint of wine is thrust into Falstaff's hand and all is happy again. But vocally Shore seemed a little off his top form, his higher notes becoming a little thin. There was little that was autumnal, though, about Yvonne Kenny's vivacious Alice, Rebecca de Pont Davies's bookish Mistress Quickly or Alice Coote's WI intriguer Meg. Susan Gritton and Toby Spence were well paired as Nannetta and Fenton. However, with the exception of Shore and the impressive Ashley Holland, singing Ford, the principals had trouble getting their words across. The orchestra played warmly under Paul Daniel, but needed to be more disciplined and transparent. Verdi's Falstaff may praise his own girth, but he has a job making himself heard unless his conductor thinks slim. \u0095 In rep until May 26. Box office: 020-7632 8300."}, "isHosted": false}}}
