The 25-year-old, who led a historic 1-2-3 USA sweep in Rio, with Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin finishing second and third, was punished under the World Anti-Doping Agency Code for failing to properly file whereabouts information on three occasions in a 12-month period. Rollins said: \u201cIt is with my deepest regrets that I have to miss the 2017 outdoor season. I accept full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension, and I am disappointed that I will have to miss this coming outdoor season, as a result of my confusion over how the whereabouts system worked. I have always been a supporter of Usada and their fight to keep our sport clean, and I will continue to do my part to prove that success can be achieved without shortcuts. This is a very unpleasant experience, but I am able to see where errors were made. I will accept the sanction and prepare myself for my return in 2018.\u201d Usada said that Rollins had received her first failure after being unavailable for IAAF testing on 27 April 2016 because she went to catch a flight. The others were in September 2016 when she forgot to update her details, first when she was travelling for a parade of honour in her hometown and then when she went to Washington to meet the then president Barack Obama. In a statement, the American Arbitration Association, which ruled on the case, said it had sympathy for Rollins, who has run the fourth-fastest 100m hurdles\u2019 time in history, because of the unusual circumstances surrounding two of her three missed tests. \u201cThis is a difficult case because it involves the imposition of a serious penalty on a brilliant athlete who is not charged or suspected of using banned substances of any kind,\u201d it said. \u201cRespondent is justly admired. Respondent won an Olympic hold medal during the months in question. She has never previously been charged with an Anti-Doping Rule violation. She successfully submitted to in-competition tests eight times and out-of-competition tests eight times during 2016. \u201cThe two conceded whereabouts failures, Incidents 2 and 3, were when she was travelling to have a parade in her honour in her hometown in Florida and to celebrate \u2018Brianna Rollins Day\u2019 and when she went to visit the White House to be feted by the President. However, while there is much at stake for Respondent, there is not much in dispute as to the facts or law of this case.\u201d The start of Rollins\u2019 12-month period of ineligibility was backdated to 19 December 2016, the day on which Usada formally notified her of her potential rule violation. As a result, Rollins\u2019 competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 27 September 2016, the date of her third whereabouts failure, have been disqualified and any medals, points, and prizes are forfeited."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
