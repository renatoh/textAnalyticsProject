The Speaker said it would not be an option after outrage across the political spectrum when the leadership hopeful Dominic Raab suggested he might try to take that path. \u201cThat is simply not going to happen. It is just so blindingly obvious that it almost doesn\u2019t need to be stated, but apparently, it does and therefore I have done,\u201d he told MPs. Matt Hancock, another Tory leadership contender, called for all his rivals to rule out the possibility of ending the parliamentary session to stop MPs from voting on whether there should be a no-deal Brexit. He said it undermined parliamentary democracy and risked a general election. Rory Stewart, another contender, called the suggestion \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d, adding: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Andrea Leadsom and Boris Johnson are also among those who have said they would not pursue such an option in order to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Amid suggestions it could even be unconstitutional, Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, asked the government for clarity on whether prorogation to avoid a decision from parliament would be allowed. In response, Mel Stride, the leader of the Commons, said prorogation was \u201cultimately in the gift of the Queen\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat I would say is, that I do think Her Majesty should be kept out of the politics of our parliament. \u201cI\u2019m sure that will be a matter that will be at the forefront of those who toy with those decisions in the future.\u201d Several senior Tories spoke out against the idea, including Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, who said: \u201cI think it\u2019s outrageous to consider proroguing parliament. We are not Stuart kings.\u201d Pete Wishart, an Scottish National party MP, called the proposal a \u201csubversion of democracy\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
