The midfielder has found that his face does not fit under the new Spurs manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who has also made the central defender Michael Dawson available for transfer. Huddlestone and Dawson were omitted by Villas-Boas from the squad that lost to Newcastle United at St James' Park on Saturday and both appear surplus to requirements as they lack the mobility that the Portuguese demands. Huddlestone has fought back from a long-term ankle injury that required two operations last season. He last played a competitive game for Spurs on 28 August against Manchester City. He was determined to hit the ground running in pre-season and he had investigated the possibility of a temporary move to a Major League Soccer club at the end of the Premier League season. DC United and San Jose Earthquakes were interested and the idea was that he could play some football with them for eight weeks or so before he linked up with the Spurs squad in the final week of July, upon their arrival in the United States for their pre-season tour. The move, though, was not permitted under MLS rules and Huddlestone suffered the disappointment of being largely overlooked by Villas-Boas in pre-season. According to sources at Tottenham, discussions have taken place over Huddlestone's future and the decision has been taken to loan him. Stoke are the favourites to sign him for the season, with Tottenham likely to seek a January recall clause. The decision comes at a time when Luka Modric is not in consideration as he awaits the outcome of his proposed transfer to Real Madrid and Scott Parker is out until October with an achilles injury. Villas-Boas's other options in central midfield are Sandro, Jake Livermore and Jermaine Jenas. Dawson has found himself down the central defensive pecking order, behind Younes Kaboul, William Gallas, Jan Vertonghen and Steven Caulker. Villas-Boas had used Dawson as the club captain during pre-season but Gallas, who was selected alongside Kaboul at Newcastle, wore the armband and there was resonance to Villas-Boas's words from last Thursday when he said that he would not name the club captain until towards the end of the transfer window, when \"we will have a better idea of the players that stay with us and come in.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
