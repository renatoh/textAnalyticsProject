Hollywood high-concept productions, which can be explained in short sentences or words on the back of a matchbox, fit the go-go-go \u201ctime is money\u201d ethos of the studio system hand in glove. How the producer Robert Kosberg got New Line Cinema to green light a schlocky American B-movie about a mutant killer dog is the stuff of legend. In the early 90s, as the story goes, Kosberg marched into an executive\u2019s office and said: \u201cIt\u2019s Jaws with paws, it\u2019s Man\u2019s Best Friend.\u201d The bloke behind the desk couldn\u2019t reach for his chequebook fast enough. In the Australian film industry, a system dependant on grants and subsidies, there is a slower and more sophisticated pitching process, with less onus on marketing speak and \u201cselling the sizzle\u201d. Nevertheless, the producer Hal McElroy pipped Kosberg\u2019s Man\u2019s Best Friend line to the post by almost a decade when he sold his 1984 Ozploitation classic Razorback as \u201cJaws on trotters\u201d. The film, a hyper-stylised outback creature feature about a humongous boar that causes all manner of death and mayhem, accrued an army of devoted fans including Quentin Tarantino and the man at the helm of the big shark movie himself, Steven Spielberg. The writer, Everett De Roche (who wrote classics Patrick, Long Weekend and Road Games), begins with a racy prologue in which grizzled Jake (Bill Kerr) is babysitting his grandson. After putting bub to bed the eponymous beast roars into his house, goes straight for the kid and drags him away. After this action-packed intro Jake is brought before the court. His unlikely tale is scrutinised and interrogated (\u201cWhat razorback? Where is it? Why hasn\u2019t anybody else seen it?\u201d). He is acquitted but regarded with uncertainty by the eyes of the public. Four years before Razorback opened in cinemas \u2013 perhaps a coincidence, perhaps not \u2013 Lindy Chamberlain\u2019s baby was taken from a camping ground near Uluru. She too was put on trial for the actions of a wild animal. The story revolves around two people on desperate searches. An American, Carl (Gregory Harrison), is trying to find his missing girlfriend, a wildlife reporter called Beth Winters (Judy Morris). Unbeknown to him she met a horrible fate, sexually assaulted by a pair of scabby Australian hicks then mauled by the boar. Jake has made it his life\u2019s purpose to find the beast who took his grandson. He is Moby-Dick\u2019s Captain Ahab reimagined as a salt-of-the-earth Aussie, one part Harold Lasseter and one part Wolf Creek\u2019s Mick Taylor. \u201cThere\u2019s something about blasting the shit out of a razorback that brightens up my whole day,\u201d is one of his true blue zingers. McElroy hired the music video specialist Russell Mulcahy, who had just made the classic clip of the Buggles\u2019s Video Killed the Radio Star, to direct the film. Nowadays the transition from music videos to motion pictures is a standard career trajectory; Razorback helped establish this process. Mulcahy went on to direct 1986\u2019s Highlander (starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery) which also became a cult classic. Mulcahy follows the Jaws model of rarely showing the beast, and only in quick bursts. By all accounts the animatronic contraption intended to bring the swine to life, and which consumed a sizeable portion of the budget, never looked realistic. This forced Mulcahy to work harder to create frightening sequences. The director took on the challenge with gusto, creating a berserk aesthetic infused with POV shots, busy backgrounds, images graded with extreme colour and shadows and mega close-ups of the creature\u2019s tusks and mouth. Razorback is a work of gut-busting visual bravado. Its graphic novel-esque look, stunning to this day, might never have eventuated had the fake pig worked. As Orson Welles put it: \u201cthe enemy of the art is the absence of limitations.\u201d Fellini it ain\u2019t, but great moments are strewn throughout. There\u2019s a kangaroo hunting scene that rehashes the danger and dread of the infamous roo sequence in Ted Kotcheff\u2019s seminal Wake in Fright. A moment when old man Jake is stuck in a creek, surrounded by ravenous boars itching to tear him apart, feels like a proto-version of the death of Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) in Ridley Scott\u2019s Hannibal (2001). A dream sequence in which Carl walks across a desert of white sand and is attacked by the bones of a dinosaur is weirdly and disturbingly beautiful. For a country known for its great outdoors and vicious wildlife, Australia has made few movies about humans fighting animals for survival. Crocodile fright fests Rogue and Black Water (both released in 2007) and shark films The Reef (2010) and Bait (2012) are rare exceptions. Razorback, or \u201cJaws on trotters\u201d, will be hard to beat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
