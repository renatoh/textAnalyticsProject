Ashton has spent the past two days observing the squad\u2019s training camp at the invitation of the coach, Stuart Lancaster, and will also be at Twickenham on Saturday week. Ashton, who coached England to the 2007 Rugby World Cup final before being replaced by Martin Johnson, has long been a confidant and friend of Lancaster and remains one of the most creative rugby thinkers around. He has also worked extensively over the years with the squad\u2019s attacking skills coach, Mike Catt. Lancaster was quick to stress Ashton is not about to be recalled as a full-time member of the national coaching panel but he is keen to explore all avenues to ensure England keep improving in the build-up to next year\u2019s World Cup: \u201cHe\u2019s a very creative attacking coach. That was a point of reference. It\u2019s good just to bounce ideas off him and clearly he\u2019s worked closely with Catty for a long time. He\u2019s an experienced coach and it\u2019s good for us to have someone like that around. I think he\u2019s enjoyed it.\u201d From Lancaster\u2019s perspective Ashton\u2019s input will also improve England\u2019s chances of entering next month\u2019s autumn series with a positive mental attitude. \u201cHe had a big influence on me as a coach,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cWhen I was an academy manager at Leeds he was in charge of the national academy and played a big part in shaping a lot of coaches\u2019 philosophies and influencing their mindset. \u201cHe\u2019s developed a lot of players, but also a lot of coaches. He\u2019s somebody I\u2019ve always stayed in contact with. After the New Zealand tour we had a chat about the games and I invited him in to get his thoughts on what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not something that will be a regular occurrence.\u201d England are resigned to being without the Northampton centre Luther Burrell for the New Zealand fixture. Burrell does not need surgery on his hand injury but is not expected to resume training before next week at the earliest. The management remain hopeful half a dozen other players will be fit to train fully by next Monday. Joe Marler (quad), Billy Vunipola (concussion), Kyle Eastmond (rib cartilage) and Marland Yarde (ankle) missed training on Tuesday while the flanker James Haskell and the prop David Wilson are recovering from a virus and a tight calf respectively. Lancaster is refusing to use England\u2019s lengthy injury list as an excuse for a sub-par autumn. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create any excuses or reasons why we shouldn\u2019t perform. We have got to turn up and deliver. We have been together now for two and a half years. When we meet up now we don\u2019t have to go back to square one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
