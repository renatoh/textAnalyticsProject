With a bit of pre-planning and careful cultivation of what they do have, they don't have to graduate with unmanageable debt. First, the good news. In 2003, the median starting salary for a graduate is expected to be \u00a320,000 a year, and employers are predicting a rise of nearly 8% in graduate vacancies. Most graduates end up in well paid, interesting jobs because they are graduates. The less good news is that this kind of leg-up does come at a price. Many UK students now have to pay at least part of the cost of their tuition - currently a maximum of \u00a31,125 a year. Tuition fees are not levied in Scotland, but students do have to pay back a \u00a32,000 endowment once they have graduated and are earning more than \u00a310,000 (soon to rise to \u00a315,000). Be warned, though: tuition fees are set to increase. Last January's white paper on the future of higher education funding would allow universities in England to increase the fees they charge students to \u00a33,000 a year from 2006. Bursaries and grants to help students from the least well-off families are available (although a grant for the poorest students is due to be introduced in 2004). These funds are designed to help with course costs such as books, and are not enough to live on. More information on what they can be worth is available from your local education authority, or education and library board in Northern Ireland. Currently, students graduate with an average of \u00a310,000 of debt accrued over their student years, according to the latest available NatWest student survey. With the introduction of higher tuition fees, this is likely to rise to an average of \u00a315,000 a year, or even up to \u00a321,000, according to the government's own estimates. The National Union of Students believes it could be much higher, maybe more like \u00a330,000. So big money is involved, but the financing of it can be cheap in comparison with taking out a car loan at high street bank rates. Take living costs, for example, the most expen sive item for the student living away from home. All students qualify for a student loan to help with these, regardless of their parents' income. The loan is partially means-tested; the amount that is free from means-testing does differ from country to country within the UK. If your son or daughter qualifies for all the loan available in the academic year 2003/04, they would get \u00a34,000 if they are living away from home; \u00a34,930 if they are at university in London and living away from home; or \u00a33,165 if they live at home. These loans attract a rate of interest that is roughly equivalent to the rate of inflation, so, in money-borrowing terms, it's a fantastic bargain. The current earnings threshold at which they will start paying back their loans is \u00a310,000, although this will rise to \u00a315,000 for repayments from April 2005. Tuition fees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are waived if the family income is low - around \u00a320,000 or less a year. Everyone else must pay them (or a contribution) upfront, but this would change under the proposals to charge top-up fees from 2006. These fees would not begin to be repaid until after the student graduates and is earning at least \u00a315,000 a year. This will be your son or daughter's debt rather than yours. What can your son and daughter do to prepare for the costs of higher education, and what can you do to help? If they have a job while they are doing their A-levels, you could encourage them to save some of the money towards their university or college career. They can soon build up a nest egg which, if saved somewhere sensible, such as in a tax-free Isa, can keep them in baked beans and bus fares if the going gets tough. If you can afford to put money aside into a university or college fund for them, all the better (even Marge Simpson has one). How much are living costs for a year in higher education? It depends. If your offspring live at home and you don't charge them any rent and still provide food, then not much. If they go away to university and have an expensive social life, an awful lot. Universities in big cities are more expensive than those in more out-of-the-way places because the cost of living, particularly accommodation, is so much higher. Universities tend to quote between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 a year as the cost for the typical student living away from home. The NUS put it higher, at between \u00a37,000 and \u00a38,000 a year, depending on location. Just to give you an idea, your daughter or son could be paying anything between \u00a370 and \u00a3120 a week for a room in a student hall of residence. The cost will vary around the country and on the number of meals provided in the package. Cook for themselves and they pay \u00a340 or \u00a350 less. They could also cut costs by sharing a room - probably by \u00a310 to \u00a315 a week. Most young people fresh out of school need help in managing money, even the ones who've had part-time jobs. The temptation to blow their student loan in the first few weeks of term on clubbing and clothes is a hard one to resist. So is the temptation to take out credit cards offering introductory low rates that can trap the unwary in debt once the rates inevitably rise. You would be doing them a favour if you took them supermarket shopping before they move away to show them how much everything costs and how to eat well but cheaply. Showing them how to budget so they know how much they have to spend on having fun would also be time well spent. The NUS provides a money management leaflet (www.nusonline.co.uk) that's worth a look. A cookbook specialising in cooking cheap food well would be a good investment. So would a pair of scissors for cutting up credit cards if the debt levels begin to rise scarily. Do warn them against the dangers of doing too much work to finance their extra-curricular activities. Studies show that students who do more than 15 hours a week are at risk of reducing their grades. And, if they hit the financial reefs, they need to know they mustn't stick their heads in the sand. There are hardship funds available from universities, and banks and credit card companies will try to work out repayment plans for people in financial strife. If they are in trouble, the best thing they can do is talk about it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
