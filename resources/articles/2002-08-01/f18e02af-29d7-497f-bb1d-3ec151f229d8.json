It suggests that the informal links between Westminster and Whitehall, which would really rather avoid responsibility for censorship and the film industry, which is happy to regulate itself, are strong and co-operative. However, there are worrying signs too. The outgoing president, Andreas Whittam-Smith, is a renowned liberal. Though no stranger to the establishment - he's now taken a job with the church - he is, as one of the founding fathers of the Independent, someone with a laudable history of promoting media freedom from vested interests in government and business. In short, if not exactly an outsider, Whittam-Smith was a man who was prepared to rock the boat a little. The new man, Sir Quentin, was with Messrs Mandelson and Campbell, one of the half-dozen people who made up the prime minister's \"war cabinet\" during the discussions with Sinn Fein that would lead to the Good Friday agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process. It's hard to avoid the suspicion that Sir Quentin, as a close associate of Mr Blair, will not be receptive to the odd call from No 10 while in charge of the BBFC. His comments on taking over are themselves typically Blairite. \"The BBFC model is a good one. It is independent, self-financing, effective and efficient.\" The BBFC, then, is all that is great about public-private partnership. (In the old days, we called it a quango.) Sir Quentin's reminder that the board is good value for money - it gets its revenue from charging distributors to have their products classified - is also a reminder of how little film classification in Britain owes to the democratic process. A cynic, not I, might propose that the appointment of Sir Quentin is an attempt by the BBFC to stay close to Tony, and so ensure its own survival. The communications white paper published in 2000 proposed that responsibility for video classification be taken away from the BBFC. This would have mean that a very large amount of the money the BBFC currently makes would disappear overnight as it lost its responsibility for video classification, and have reduced its influence overall. The government has subsequently agreed that the BBFC should retain video classification responsibility, and independence from Ofcom, the media regulator. Indeed, Sir Quentin alludes to the issue today. \"At a time when the arrangements for overall regulation for the media and telecoms are being revised, the need for a separate body dedicated to prior classification of films and videos is clear, as the government has recognised.\" My cynical friend might suggest that the government's recognition of this need is contingent on its having a strong hand in the activities of such a body, perhaps by ensuring that the body be run by someone friendly to it. None of this is to criticise the effectiveness of the BBFC, which does a tremendously difficult job astonishingly well. Its decision to award a 12 certificate to Spider-Man, contrary to industry interests when the film could have garnered a large under-12 audience, was both brave and justified. Likewise, its continued refusal to bow to the hysterical scissor-wielders at the Daily Mail when it knows from public and professional consultation what protection the public wants and needs, is in the best British traditions of informed, unpatronising liberalism. Nor is it to damn Sir Quentin from the outset. The president's job at the BBFC is, if not ceremonial, at least largely philosophical. The hard day-to-day work of classification has always been done by the director, and the present incumbent Robin Duval is committed to the broadly liberal and consensual stance set out over the past few years. Sir Quentin may turn out to be as considered and as admirable a president as his forerunner. Certainly his work in Northern Ireland would strongly suggest that he will be able to tackle vested interests and entrenched positions with firmness and diplomacy. What the appointment does highlight though, is the absence of democratic accountability in our system of censorship. The BBFC is an industry body which we, the public, neither fund nor elect. Its president, it is fair to infer, is appointed with the connivance of the prime minister and the Department of Culture, but not through any official channel. The subsequent parliamentary designation as classifier of videos is a fudge which looks like nothing so much as a check to make sure the BBFC behaves. If the BBFC is independent, we should expect that its major appointments do not look so much like placements by president Tony. If it isn't, then its running should be brought within the control of a governement department whose minsiters are answerable to parliament. The cosy gentleman's agreement which prevails at the moment is too 19th century by half."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
