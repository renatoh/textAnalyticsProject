Opening with a quote from Paul Monet, \u201cGrief is a sword, or it is nothing\u201d, France\u2019s book chronicles how the activist community fought to develop the drugs that would turn HIV into a largely treatable condition. It covers the years between 1981 and 1996, when, as France puts it, \u201cthere was no effective medical treatment for an HIV infection and death was almost certain\u201d, and how with the founding of Act Up (Aids Coalition to Unleash Power) and TAG (Treatment Action Group), activists paved the way towards a medical breakthrough. France, an investigative reporter and film-maker who has followed the rise of Aids since the beginning of the outbreak, beat titles including Simon Schama\u2019s Belonging and Christopher de Bellaigue\u2019s The Islamic Enlightenment to win the \u00a330,000 award, the UK\u2019s top prize for non-fiction. Bazalgette, the author and chairman of ITV who chaired the judges, said the panel had been looking for books that were \u201cvery well-written, engaging and enjoyable, and revelatory \u2013 saying something important\u201d. \u201cHere\u2019s a book that works in at least three really interesting ways,\u201d he said of France\u2019s winning title, which draws from his 2012 Oscar-nominated documentary of the same name. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly visceral, personal story of someone who was a young gay man in the 80s in New York as the Aids epidemic developed. On a wider level it is the story of how society reacted to [the illness], and the enormous prejudice against gay men. And the third really interesting story is the relationship between the gay community and big pharma \u2013 the hunt there was to find a palliative, and how David France and his contemporaries became the guinea pigs for the drug companies.\u201d Bazalgette said that France\u2019s book had \u201cso many layers, and is substantial \u2013 it\u2019s a really important historical document\u201d. France has also written about the Catholic sexual abuse scandal, in Our Fathers, while his latest film is a documentary about a transgender activist, The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson. According to Bazalgette, the panel took two hours to pick a winner from a shortlist that also included books from Kapka Kassabova, Daniel Mendelsohn and Mark O\u2019Connell. \u201cEach book on the shortlist of six examined what it means to be human \u2013 what it means to be Jewish, to be Muslim, to be an exile, to be a son, to be a father, to be gay,\u201d said Bazalgette, who was joined on the judging panel by the science writer Anjana Ahuja, the tenor and writer Ian Bostridge, academic and writer Sarah Churchwell, and the journalist and broadcaster Razia Iqbal. After working with his fellow judges through more than 150 books, Bazalgette said that non-fiction today was in very healthy condition, and spoke out for its importance in an age of fake news. \u201cThese are profound, thoughtful pieces of work, which are all about us now, even when they\u2019re works of history,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are serious pieces of work, well-sourced, published by bona fide publishers whom we trust. In a world of wild fabrications, paranoia, rumours and fake news, here is an antidote. These are more than enjoyable reads. It is very important to have these books.\u201d The Baillie Gifford prize, formerly known as the Samuel Johnson award, has been won in the past by, among others, Philippe Sands and Helen Macdonald."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
