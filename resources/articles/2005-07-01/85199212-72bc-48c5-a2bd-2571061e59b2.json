Britain's most authoritative foreign policy thinktank publishes a devastating assessment of why we have become so vulnerable to attack. There is 'no doubt', says a report [by Chatham House, formerly the Royal Institute of International Affairs], that the invasion of Iraq has left Britain more exposed ... \"As the government's many critics predicted ... this misbegotten war has only served to offer terrorism new opportunities. But that doesn't mean ... a direct link with the London bombings. The hatred that drove the killers to murder their own countrymen was poisoning impressionable young minds long before the invasion ... That said, the ... report can't be brushed aside. Without question, Iraq has damaged Britain's reputation, radicalised some young Muslims and proved a propaganda gift for the apostles of hate.\" Gulf Times Editorial, Qatar, July 19 \"[The report] is unlikely to surprise many people. However, it has infuriated the British government, which feels vulnerable to criticism in the aftermath of the London bombing. Particularly stinging is the ... suggestion that the Blair government has been playing poodle to its American masters ... \"Despite official rejection of the report its observations are hard to deny. That is apparent from the reply given by Tony Blair's spokesman: 'Is the report simply suggesting we should have put our heads down and hope we wouldn't be attacked?\" ... But that was not what the report said. The point it made was that the UK should have fought terrorism instead of attacking Iraq.\" Steve Richards Independent, July 19 \"Britain's vulnerability is not a reason in itself for withdrawing support from the United States, but the cause of the alliance must determine whether the risks are worth it ... What is happening in Iraq now and to other countries, including Spain and Britain, should ... come as no surprise at all to George Bush and Mr Blair. The intelligence agencies warned in advance that the war would increase the threat posed by terrorists ... \"It is becoming increasingly clear that Mr Blair decided to back the war against Iraq in spite of warnings from a range of close colleagues and advisers. The recent bombs in London, Turkey and of course Baghdad call this judgment into question once more.\" Australian Editorial, July 19 \"The western self-blamers have talked about the London bombings as blowback for the thousands of civilian deaths in Iraq since April 2003, but their macabre calculus overlooks a simple point: coalition troops are not behind the slaughter in Iraq. The attacks ... are being perpetrated by the same people - loosely speaking, Islamist fanatics opposed to the spread of democracy and enlightenment - who organised and executed the London bombings ... \"Amid all the wild claims of the self-blamers, it must never be forgotten that Iraq has a legitimate, democratically elected government that welcomes the toppling of Saddam Hussein and has called on coalition troops to stay put. Unfortunately, that government still has a long way to go before it enjoys a monopoly on violence.\" Financial Times Editorial, July 19 \"The false debate is whether Britain is (or was) more likely to be attacked because of its involvement in Iraq alongside the US. The primary question of which countries were targets was settled a decade ago when Osama bin Laden published the manifesto of the International Front to Combat Jews and Crusaders. Under this definition, while Britain and France, say, may have taken opposing sides in Iraq, they are equally complicit in the post-Ottoman carve-up of Arab and Muslim lands and, for varying reasons at different times, equally subject to jihad. \"But the real debate before the war ... was whether Iraq was the right target given that al-Qaida and its franchise was the clear and present danger, and the foremost threat to liberal values and international stability. Just as the answer was no then, the consequences of this misguided strategy should be clear now.\" Linda Heard Gulf News, United Arab Emirates, July 19 \"What is needed is honest and open debate as to the real roots of the extremist threat, a concept which Mr Blair equates to heresy. Instead, his argument hinges on educated young men from respectable families turning on the societies which nurtured them out of misguided religious fervour completely divorced from their country's foreign policies. The devastation wrought by allied forces during an illegal war waged on false pretexts has nothing to do with the July 7 bombs, he insists, a belief which lets him personally off the hook, provided he can sell it to the nation ... \"While [British Muslims] all unreservedly condemned the London blasts and avowed love of the country, they also expressed their fury at the suffering of their 'brothers and sisters' in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine ... It is surely this type of anger, valid anger, which is exploited by recruiters for al-Qaida and its cancerous franchises. And by attempting to gloss over this anger, Mr Blair is in danger of further marginalising young British Muslims.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
