The England selectors will be looking little further than the one-day squad today when they announce the party for the brief two-match Test tour of India that follows the intensive seven-game ODI jaunt across that country. Two certain additions in Andrew Strauss and Monty Panesar, neither part of the one-day scene, and perhaps a second wicketkeeper, should such a truncated programme demand it, will come at the expense of Luke Wright, Ravi Bopara and Samit Patel, the latter's left-arm spin not yet up to Test-match standard beyond occasional use and offering no variation to the senior spinner, Panesar. Any thoughts of including the young Yorkshire all-rounder Adil Rashid to give him experience should have been shelved. A single warm-up match in Baroda, in which presumably the projected Test XI will play, is all the cricket outside the Tests in Ahmedabad and Mumbai so there would be scant opportunity aside from assimilating a little dressing-room atmosphere, for which there will be time aplenty in the future. He is barely out of his teens and with astute handling may provide the fulcrum of England's spin attack for a decade in the future. He must not be rushed. For now his progress has flattened off and his development will be served better on the Lions tour. Parties for Test tours usually comprise 16 and sometimes 17 players, a couple of whom generally disappear into oblivion to become known as Lucans. In this instance, even 16 players would appear an unnecessary extravagance. The need to maintain options in the structure of the team remains, although there is little clue as to what that might be in the most recent history of the two venues. The Gujarat stadium in Ahmedabad last hosted a Test match back in April, and if the website blurb on the ground suggests the pitch has become low and slow, with draws the norm, then no one bothered to tell the South Africans, whose pace trio of Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini and Morne Morkel bowled the Twenty20 champions out first time around in precisely 20 overs for 76 and went on to win by an innings and 90 runs. The Mumbai Test will be played not at the dump that the Wankhede Stadium has become but at the grand old Brabourne just half a mile up the road, which saw a dull draw last time out. But as that was against Tony Lewis's England 35 years ago, it offers not much of a steer. Given the nature of England's bowling strength, however, it would be a surprise if either venue produced anything remotely likely to offer undue assistance to pace or far from crumbling. This being the case, a second front-line spinner will be required, one capable of performing a major role, and the only one who fits that bill is the off-spinner Graeme Swann, who will also have been in India with the one-day team. The absence of Michael Vaughan, confirmed by the chairman of selectors, Geoff Miller, over the weekend, was predictable and strongly flagged at the time of the central-contract announcements, of which the former captain was a beneficiary. His retention clearly had a longer-term objective than the India tour so expect him to be in the Caribbean in the new year to wipe away any complacency in batsmen whose position, unlike that of the bowlers, has scarcely been challenged in the last year or so. The absence of strong thrusts from the shires means that Owais Shah, who enjoyed a vibrant Test debut in the Wankhede when England won there three winters ago, should once more be included, presumably on the sidelines, a position to which he is well used. Given that he is a central plank of the one-day side, however, he will at least have had competitive cricket during the lead-in to the series. He is an adept player of spin so his one-day form may decide his ultimate role. Will two wicketkeepers be necessary? Tim Ambrose will have been jettisoned, to be replaced by the resurgent Matt Prior as the first choice. For a reserve, the temptation might be to pick a like-for-like cricketer, which would still point the finger at Ambrose, who is included in the ECB's new secondary list of contracts. That apart, though, this would make no sense, not least because his batting, the reason for his inclusion in the first place, proved fallible once the opposition had twigged his limited method. Instead the selectors could do worse than treat the wicketkeeper as they might a bowler in balancing the side. Should England choose to go into a match with five bowlers, necessity demands that the best batsman/wicketkeeper plays, which means Prior. Four bowlers only - unlikely but possible - and the strengthened batting would leave the opportunity to select the best gloveman. James Foster has been touted continually as the neatest around, and his century in Essex's final match will have signified that he is no fool with the bat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
