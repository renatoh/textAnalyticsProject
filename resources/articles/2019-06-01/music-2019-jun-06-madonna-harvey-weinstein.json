In an interview with the New York Times, the singer described Weinstein as \u201cincredibly sexually flirtatious and forward with me when we were working together. He was married at the time, and I certainly wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d She said she was aware he had acted similarly with her female peers. \u201cWe were all, \u2018Harvey gets to do that because he\u2019s got so much power and he\u2019s so successful and his movies do so well and everybody wants to work with him, so you have to put up with it.\u2019 So that was it.\u201d When allegations that Weinstein had raped and assaulted women were reported in October 2017, Madonna said she wasn\u2019t \u201ccheering from the rafters because I\u2019m never going to cheer for someone\u2019s demise. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good karma. But it was good that somebody who had been abusing his power for so many years was called out and held accountable.\u201d In the interview, Madonna also denied the rumour that she had once asked Donald Trump on a date. She recalled that while she shot a Versace campaign with Steven Meisel at the photographer\u2019s Palm Beach home, Trump repeatedly called to talk to her. \u201cHe kept going: \u2018Hey, is everything OK? Finding yourself comfortable? Are the beds comfortable? Is everything good? Are you happy?\u2019\u201d She said Trump had a weak character: \u201cA man who is secure with himself, a human who is secure with themselves, doesn\u2019t have to go around bullying people all the time,\u201d she said. After the New York Times published its story, Madonna had similarly strong words for the journalist, Vanessa Grigoriadis, in a post on her Instagram account. \u201cTo say that I was disappointed in the article would be an understatement,\u201d Madonna wrote. She criticised Grigoriadis from \u201c[choosing] to focus on trivial and superficial matters\u201d including \u201cnever-ending comments about my age which would never have been mentioned had I been a MAN!\u201d In the original interview, Madonna said of the leak of her 2015 album Rebel Heart: \u201cI felt raped.\u201d Grigoriadis remarked: \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right to explain that women these days were trying not to use that word metaphorically.\u201d In her Instagram post, Madonna said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I spent five minutes with [Grigoriadis]. It makes me feel raped. And yes I\u2019m allowed to use that analogy having been raped at the age of 19.\u201d She concluded that this was \u201cfurther proof that the NYT is one of the founding fathers of the patriarchy. And I say DEATH TO THE PATRIARCHY woven deep into the fabric of society. I will never stop fighting to eradicate it.\u201d Madonna releases Madame X, her 14th studio album, on 14 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
