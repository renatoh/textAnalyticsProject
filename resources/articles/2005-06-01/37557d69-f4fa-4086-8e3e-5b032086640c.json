I'm 30-years-old, have about \u00a31,000 in a pension pot from an old employer and currently do not make any contributions. I have heard figures ranging from \u00a350 a month up to around \u00a3300 to give me a \"comfortable\" retirement. If I wanted a \u00a324,000 a year retirement pot, from age 65, how much do I need to save? Nobody seems to be able to give me an answer. SS A I'm not surprised no one has answered your question, as it is impossible to provide the specific information you want. There are so many variables as to what will happen over the next 25 to 30 years. Insurance companies use standard annual growth rates - ranging from 4-8% - to try and calculate the size of pension fund that might be built up over a period of years - but they admit these are rough estimates. No one can foresee what actual growth rates will be achieved. It is also impossible to know the annuity rate at the time of taking the pension and indeed whether annuities will continue to exist. There are likely to be huge changes in the whole pension savings industry, as the government seeks to solve the massive potential problem of many pensioners facing poverty levels in the years to come, primarily as a result of the continuing rise in life expectancy. All I can say is that the more you are able to save now, the better your chances of providing a reasonable retirement income. At present, there are restrictions on the amount you can contribute to a pension, but from April 2006 there will be far greater flexibility to put more money aside for your retirement. Nevertheless, the sooner you start saving the better, especially if you are a higher-rate taxpayer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
