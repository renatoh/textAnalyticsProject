Sally-Ann Hart was heckled as she made the remarks at a Hastings and Rye constituency hustings on Thursday evening, where she is vying to defend the Tories\u2019 wafer-thin majority after Amber Rudd stood down. A furore ensued after Hart, a councillor in East Sussex, was challenged over an article she had shared on Facebook that said \u201cpeople with learning difficulties should be allowed to work for less than the minimum wage\u201d. \u201cIt was about people with learning difficulties,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cAbout them being given the opportunity to work because it\u2019s to do with the happiness they have about working \u2026 Some people with learning difficulties they don\u2019t understand about money. \u201cIt is about having a therapeutic exemption and the article was in support of employing people with learning difficulties, that\u2019s what it was. You should read the article.\u201d One attendee tweeted: \u201cI attended the hustings meeting last night and was shocked by Sally-Ann Hart\u2019s reactionary and callous views that are more suited to the Victorian era than the 21st century.\u201d Labour also condemned her remarks and claimed the Conservatives had created a \u201chostile environment\u201d for disabled people that would continue to push people into poverty unless the party was voted out. \u201cDisabled people are already shut out of employment and have been disproportionately harmed by the Conservative and Lib Dems\u2019 cuts,\u201d said Marsha de Cordova, the shadow minister for disabled people. \u201cNow, these comments further expose the contempt the Conservatives feel for disabled people, which underlie their policies towards us.\u201d She added: \u201cThese aren\u2019t comments Sally-Ann Hart made years ago. She made them during this election. Anyone with such hateful views has no place in parliament.\u201d Hart was due to be interviewed by the BBC on Friday morning but pulled out at short notice saying she did not feel well. She told the Guardian in a statement: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, I was trying to emphasise that more needs to be done to help those with learning disabilities into the workplace and having properly paid work. \u201cMy comments have been taken out of context, but I do apologise if any offence or alarm has been caused. The number of disabled people in work has hit a record high under this government, and I am committed to doing more to supporting those with learning disabilities into good, secure jobs.\u201d It is believed that the article in question appeared in the Spectator in 2017. The businesswoman Rosa Monckton, whose youngest daughter has Down\u2019s syndrome, had argued that people with disabilities would be denied the \u201chuman dignity that comes with work\u201d unless there was a change in the law due to the \u201cratcheting up\u201d of the minimum wage. Ciara Lawrence, who works as a campaigns support officer at the charity Mencap and has a learning disability, said: \u201cPeople with a learning disability, like me, can work and can make really fantastic employees with the right support. \u201cWe have a right to be treated and paid equally \u2013 it\u2019s the law. I\u2019m proof that with the right support people with a learning disability can make some of the best and most committed employees.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
