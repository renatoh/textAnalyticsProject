The National Theatre of Scotland and the London-based National Theatre of Great Britain, as it's known overseas, come together as co-producers for the first time just as their capital cities are threatening to wave goodbye. When Rona Munro's trilogy begins its run in London, the Scottish referendum will be only days away. If it comes up with a yes vote, will the National Theatre of Great Britain be obliged to edit down its name? The James Plays are a tacit rather than explicit argument about Scottish independence. Struck by the influence that Shakespeare's Histories have had on the way the English think about themselves, Munro has dramatised the lives of the three generations of Stewart kings who reigned in Scotland for the greater part of the 15th century. The records and testimony are scanty but Munro has dug up facts, amalgamated some characters, shifted some chronology and made a narrative with episodes that are likely to come round again. The result is an adventurous leap for the Edinburgh festival. Not only in scale but in immediacy: it's unusual to find something in the international programme which aims to press urgently on the audience's pulses. It demonstrates the panache of Laurie Sansom, who took over as artistic director of NTS last year, and who gives the productions a broad sweep and considerable drive. Yet let's not get festivalitis, particularly likely to be contracted by audiences and critics who have sat through a long drama \u2013 this lasts nigh on nine hours \u2013 and need to justify the spending of their time. This is an ambitious enterprise, studded with vivacious episodes, sometimes delighting with the information it has quarried. Yet it rarely startles with its view of Scotland and politics. More surprisingly, from the author of the searing prison drama Iron, its dialogue is often flatly demotic. You get an arc and a roll from this trilogy, you get recurring themes, and a great and welcome line of mighty women. But you get little texture in the language, or psychological intricacy. Jon Bausor's bold, dark design sets up the audience for confrontation from the beginning. An onstage tier of seats is set against the stalls. The stage is duskily lit, invaded by belches of smoke, the quintessence of Auld Reekie. It is dominated by a two-storey-high sword, stuck into the ground like a gauntlet. That sepulchral challenge remains through the three plays, though the style of each is quite different. Hectic and effective, The Key Will Keep the Lock shows how James I, imprisoned as a child in England, imposed his reign on the land-hungry, axe-chucking big families of Scotland. James McArdle plausibly makes him tight-voiced with nervousness, though why after years of incarceration he should sound so Scottish is puzzling. Jamie Sives's Henry V is chiefly notable for his swearing. He can't open his mouth without saying fuck: presumably because the education is bad in England. This most exciting play of the trilogy begins with roars and man pigtails and goes on to expose a barbarity that may be brilliantly cruel invention or brilliantly retrieved fact. One of those ranting lords is so fed up with a poor female complainant that he nails horseshoes to her feet and hands. \"Well,\" the mother of the nailer says, \"she could be annoying.\" That mother is played by the excellent Blythe Duff, fiery but not expostulating, who cuts like a blade with gesture and voice. She can subdue a line of big-chested thugs with a flare of her nostril. The second and weakest of the plays, Day of the Innocents, traces the troubled history of James II, a child king with a blotch on his face, who is locked into an intense friendship with a lord, which is debated for far too long. Puppets are wheeled on to play the nightmare childhood, but they simply muddy the scene: are they little dummies or do they have a metaphorical force, suggesting that no one at court is a free agent? The high point is Stephanie Hyam as the young French queen, giving a dainty, acute performance which lightly summons a sense of a period. She is like a tiny figure glimpsed through a window in a medieval painting. She is an actor to be watched. The True Mirror \u2013 the final play, costumed halfway to the 21st century \u2013 has one brilliant notion: the idea that a real mirror might turn everyone's notion of herself topsy-turvy. It features as its strong centre a Danish princess. Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l \u2013 known to British TV audiences from The Killing but long established as a stage actor in Denmark \u2013 gives all you might have expected from her once she got out of that sweater. As Queen Margaret she is contained, gracious, betrayed and forceful. The focus of her nut-like face tightens a sprawling episode in which the period is indulgently undetermined. It is up to her towards the end of the evening to speak directly to today's audience and its concerns. When James III shimmies out of his penitent robes to show shiny scarlet trousers and a liking for a bloke in a leather skirt, Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l takes over. She looks into the audience and proclaims: \"All you have is attitude.\" Of course this is a political accusation: you're not going to follow through and convert feeling into principled action. Yet it is also ingratiating: praising a nation for bella figura. What could be more quintessentially Scottish than a compliment disguised as an aggression? The James Plays are at Festival theatre, Edinburgh until Friday, then at National Theatre, London SE1 from 10 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
