When Victoria Derbyshire became the latest of many broadcasters to use a derogatory term for female genitalia to refer to the Conservative leadership hopeful \u2013 there\u2019s even a Viz cartoon about it \u2013 experts at the University of Pennysylvania\u2019s Language Log started asking why. \u201cI wonder if the leading K sound is because they expect to say Corbyn then change to Hunt too late,\u201d pondered one. Another wrote: \u201cIt seems to me that the similarity between a \u2018h\u2019 and a \u2018k\u2019 sound (at least when it\u2019s a strongly pronounced \u2018h\u2019) is part of the picture.\u201d Sam Steddy, a linguistics lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, believes there are a few factors leading to the constant slips of the tongue. First, there\u2019s the spoonerism dating back to the current foreign secretary\u2019s former cabinet role. Or, as Naughtie said on the Today programme in 2010: \u201cFirst up after the news I\u2019m going to be talking to Jeremy Cunt \u2013 Hunt, the culture secretary.\u201d \u201cThere are particular circumstances which make that spoonerism so predictable,\u201d says Steddy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good rhyme. The vowels are all the same, particularly in hunt and culture secretary and the expletive. The \u2018u\u2019s are all virtually the same, there\u2019s only one consonant and the rhymes of the syllables are identical. They\u2019re all really alike \u2013 and the more alike things are, the easier they are to get mixed up.\u201d Adding to this is that the scansion of \u201cJeremy Hunt, the culture secretary\u201d falls on both Hunt and culture. \u201cWhen we make sentences we don\u2019t tend to string nouns together, at least not in that number, and that can do funny things with stress,\u201d says Steddy. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a name like Jeremy Hunt, there\u2019s an identifiable stressed syllable in Hunt and then culture, so they\u2019re both the most emphasised syllable. Probably by virtue of that, the \u2018h\u2019 and the \u2018c\u2019 are more liable to being swapped around.\u201d Then there is the fairly similar tongue movement required to make the two sounds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get your tongue a little further back in the mouth to make the \u2018h\u2019, but the \u2018c\u2019 is created at the back of the mouth cavity so the similarity there could well lend itself to confusion,\u201d says Steddy. \u201cMaybe he should have insisted people describe him as state secretary for culture.\u201d But even this might not have solved the issue: presenters might be getting their Jeremies muddled up at the last minute and introducing him as Corbyn. Or, as Steddy says: \u201cThere\u2019s also people being afraid of making exactly this mistake\u201d \u2013 Andrew Marr made the same slip-up as Naughtie just a week later. \u201cThere had been some outcry and he was trying really hard not to do it \u2013 and then did.\u201d For anyone clutching their pearls over broadcasters dropping the C-bomb, even Hunt has become accustomed to it, telling the Telegraph that it wasn\u2019t always an accident. \u201cI had this when I was at school. Personally I think people should just grow up and get over the fact that my last name rhymes with a rather unpleasant word,\u201d he said. Could the presenters\u2019 views of Hunt\u2019s achievements in politics have anything to do with it? \u201cWell, he\u2019s not popular is he. He\u2019s never been popular,\u201d says Steddy. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously a contributing factor, too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
