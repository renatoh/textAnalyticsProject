Gary Neville 7 Rock-solid in defence and a potent attacking weapon with his buccaneering overlapping runs. More than just a right-back Rio Ferdinand 4 Looked unusually nervous from the start and his mistake for Celtic's first goal, when he mis-judged the flight of the ball, was inexplicable Wes Brown 6 The England defender kept his head while Rio Ferdinand was struggling to keep his and did his job in his usual under-stated way Mika\u00ebl Silvestre 6 Won a surprise recall ahead of the in-form Patrice Evra and he had his hands full with the impressive Nakamura Darren Fletcher 5 Steady but rather un-spectacular. Will never offer the flair of Ronaldo and lacked the attacking intent of the suspended winger Paul Scholes 6 Showed signs of ring rustiness after a three-game ban in the early stages, but grew into the game in the second half Michael Carrick 7 Proved he is a ball-winner as well as a creative force. Displayed his range of passing, but also relished physical battle with Gravesen Ryan Giggs 7 Looked set for a pivotal role until he was injured in a collision with Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc that resulted in United's penalty equaliser Wayne Rooney 5 Subdued in first half and found it difficult to make an impression in the second. Still waiting to end two-year European goal famine Louis Saha 8 Asked to fill the hole left by Ruud van Nistelrooy, he more than justified the faith placed in him with two goals in a confident performance Substitutes Solskjaer (for Giggs, 33), O'Shea (for Scholes, 80) Richardson (for Rooney, 86) Not used Kuszczak, Evra, Smith, Vidic Celtic Artur Boruc 6 Rash decision to charge out to Giggs resulted in a United penalty, but the Pole made up for his error with some fine second-half saves Mark Wilson 5 Struggled to cope with the pace and trickery of Giggs before the winger went off injured. Inexperience showed at times Gary Caldwell 5 Manfully took on the challenge of facing Rooney, Saha and then Solskjaer, but the United forwards always seemed one step ahead Stephen McManus 6 Started brightly and looked commanding but Saha quickly gained the upper hand and the centre-half endured a testing evening. Lee Naylor 6 A big step-up from Wolves, but Naylor was steady at left-back. May have been different had he been up against Cristiano Ronaldo Neil Lennon 7 Kept it neat and simple, but lost his rag with McManus when he angrily shoved his team-mate in the chest after a defensive mistake Shunsuke Nakamura 7 The Japanese midfielder had the measure of Silvestre and he highlighted his obvious ability with his free-kick equaliser Thomas Gravesen 5 Tenacious as usual, but he was at fault for two of United's goals and he will not look back on this game with too many fond memories Jiri Jarosik 5 Floated between his midfield role and the forward line, where he supported Vennegoor of Hesselink as an auxiliary striker. Aiden McGready 5 The Republic of Ireland youngster contributed little going forward and failed too often to keep the raiding Gary Neville in check Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink 7 Gave Ferdinand a torrid time, especially when he outmuscled the \u00a330m defender and beat Edwin van der Sar for the opener Substitutes Telfer (for Wilson, 52) Miller (for Jarosik, 56) Not used Marshall, Balde, Sno, Zurawski, Miller, Maloney"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
