They\u2019ve all come here, to Istanbul\u2019s Emin\u00f6n\u00fc district, to document the last day of the bal\u0131k ekmek boats. According to Istanbul lore, they have been catching fish here, cooking it on deck and selling it in sandwiches since the 1800s. The product is bal\u0131k ekmek (\u201cfish bread\u201d) \u2013 fish (typically mackerel or a similar oily fish), onions, lettuce, a squeeze of lemon juice, all inside a white roll \u2013 its basic ingredients hinting at its origins, a way for fishermen to flog their excess catch after rich hauls. And while the boats have dwindled over the years \u2013 with city authorities keen to clamp down on this mostly unregulated, sometimes unhygienic trade \u2013 it\u2019s a tradition that has been carried on by three boats moored just off Galata Bridge, which spans the Golden Horn. More gaudy, golden, floating kitchens than fisherman\u2019s skiffs, they have been operating under a municipality tender since 2007; the garsons in faux-Ottoman blazers and captain\u2019s hats serving hundreds of Turks and tourists every day. But no more. As \u0130stanbullus found out this week, all three boats \u2013 together forming the Bal\u0131k Ekmek Tur\u0131zm Kooperatifi \u2013 see their lease expire on 1 November. The owners have vowed to stay open, and a dispute first with the police, and then in the courts, may ensue. But the municipality seemingly has no plans to replace them, with designs for a \u201cmore holistic\u201d approach to Istanbul\u2019s historic centre. As the mayor explained to journalists, \u201cNo-one owns a permanent property in any part of Istanbul.\u201d As a woman tells a TV camera how much she opposes the decision, the surrounding crowd burst into applause. It seems in part a confected controversy \u2013 stirred up by a media eager to show the new mayor as out of touch \u2013 and more than one resident rolled their eyes at the mere mention of the boats. Others pointed to online gossip about the darker side of it all, about the alleged connections the owners must have to have secured such a lucrative spot. But there is genuine sadness here too. Ibrahim, a retiree with jet-black dyed hair and a military jacket, tells me with some sense of fury that he comes to the boats maybe every other day. With a lunch costing just 15 Turkish lira (\u00a32), it is, he reasons, simply the cheapest meal around. Indeed, while Istanbul\u2019s other central districts can be prohibitively expensive \u2013 particularly for those from the city\u2019s fringes \u2013 Emin\u00f6n\u00fc has retained some popular appeal. The famous lyrics of an 1980s Turkish song even long for the days of taking a minibus around town, and \u201ck\u00f6pr\u00fcde bal\u0131k-ekmek yemek\u201d \u2013 eating bal\u0131k ekmek on the bridge. Which taps into something deeper too, for few places can be as ever-willing to embrace nostalgia \u2013 and the bitter-sweetness of loss \u2013 as Istanbul. Karin, who has now moved far away to the Black Sea coast, told me she lived here for years and did not go to the bal\u0131k ekmek boats even once. Now, somehow, it\u2019s the thing she misses most, the first place she visits when she returns. \u201cThere is no Emin\u00f6n\u00fc without this,\u201d she says. It is an open secret that the bal\u0131k ekmek fish no longer comes from the Bosphorous strait. The Golden Horn \u2013 the point where the strait meets the Sea of Marmara and so-called for the abundance of dolphin and fish that once passed through it \u2013 no longer teems with life. It now comes from Scandinavia, via Istanbul\u2019s wholesale fish market. It is but one small change in a city that has transformed beyond all recognition since its fishermen started selling sandwiches on the side two centuries ago. But no matter the boats\u2019 tenuous connection to the past, for some \u0130stanbullus, it was enough: this is the tradition now, in all its kitsch glory. As Ibrahim shouted to me, and all passers-by, \u2018This is history!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
