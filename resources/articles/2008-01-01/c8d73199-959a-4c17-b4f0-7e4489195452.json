The Turkish midfielder Emre has been linked with a move to France to join Monaco or to Germany with Bayer Leverkusen, while the striker Shola Ameobi is wanted by the former Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder at Norwich City. There has also been interest in the former England Under-21 international from Middlesbrough and Bolton. Allardyce said: \"I do not want to lose any players really, but I'm in the same boat as everyone else. If a large enough offer is made for one of my fringe players, and we can use the money to bring in a replacement who will strengthen the side, then we will look at it. If clubs are interested, and I'm not specifically talking about Shola Ameobi or anyone else for that matter, then they have to come up with a sizeable bid.\" Allardyce had previously refused to contemplate the possibility of allowing anyone to leave this month, but he realises there is no point keeping unhappy players at the club, particularly if he can quickly invest the money in his own type of players. Newcastle made an offer to Manchester United for the defender Wes Brown last week and completed the signing of the 18-year-old French striker Wesley Ngo Baheng from Le Havre yesterday. Ameobi, whose recent absence from the first-team squad has been put down to a knee injury, is understood to be disillusioned at his hometown club and would welcome a move. Emre is also frustrated at being a substitute under Allardyce and will almost certainly be allowed to leave if the Magpies can land Arsenal's French midfielder Lassana Diarra. However, Emre could get the chance to start for Newcastle next week as Nicky Butt will serve a two-game ban after the trip to his former club, Manchester United, and Joey Barton cannot play, as he is awaiting trial for assault and affray following an incident in Liverpool over the Christmas period. Celtic are confident they can succeed in their bid to add a second Japanese midfielder. Koki Mizuno, a 22-year-old who plays for JEF United, has been earmarked for a move to Scotland where he would join his compatriot Shunsuke Nakamura at Parkhead. Mizuno has been targeted by a host of European clubs since making his J-League debut four years ago but with four international caps would appear to fall short of work-permit criteria. However, Celtic officials will stress the player's age as a mitigating circumstance, and will point to the success enjoyed by Nakamura as cause to believe Mizuno will benefit the game in Scotland at a department of employment meeting today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
