She generated a colossal archive of American public life: tens of thousands of videocassettes that had to be stored in nine apartments. This documentary shows Stokes to have the fanatical energy of a hoarder, the zeal of an evangelist and the intensity of a visionary. As a young woman, she was a socialist, fiercely aware of her own status as an African American, which she made the point of debate in the local discussion TV show she produced in the 60s. It was there she met John Stokes, a wealthy white liberal: they married, and it was the second time around for both. Marion\u2019s flash of insight came in the late 70s when she saw how TV news was being revolutionised. With rolling news and the arrival of late-night news programmes, there was simply much, much more being broadcast. Previously, news had been carefully edited and curated by the powers that be for relatively brief programmes: important things happening to important people. Stokes saw that this vast new output would, almost accidentally, show more of the lives of working people and people of colour. She wanted to capture it \u2013 like Britain\u2019s Mass Observation Project \u2013 and the TV stations were not keeping their own recorded footage. But is this the whole story? Was the Marion Stokes project also a symptom of her own emotional dysfunction? She didn\u2019t just hoard news: it was also books, Apple computers and piles of mouldering old newspapers, and it isn\u2019t clear even from this film if Stokes herself ever rewatched any footage. After her death, the project was handed over to the Internet Archive in San Francisco, which digitised it and made it a searchable archive using the closed-caption subtitling: a resounding vindication of Stokes\u2019s obsessive life\u2019s work. Having watched this documentary, I now think the project could also be seen as a gigantic adventure in conceptual art, and this is not to denigrate it in any way. \u2022 Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project is available on digital platforms from 6 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
