The National Division One club is fed up with its continued failure to break into English rugby's elite division and is considering applying to the Welsh League, where it feels it might be able to enjoy more success. One small snag may be that London Welsh do not want to move from their base in the capital and that is unlikely to go down too well with Welsh rugby union officials considering their application. \u00b7 Entertainment has been in short supply for England's cricketers in India, but Mark Butcher managed to lift spirits in Hyderabad. When the Taj Krishna hotel's Bulgarian singer offered her lame rendition of Tina Turner's What's Love Got To Do With It? Butcher could not resist helping her out, donning a black wig and belting out his own memorable version."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
