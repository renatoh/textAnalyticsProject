This familiar character on Portugal\u2019s beaches in the 1940s has been transformed into a menacing Sibyl. With her ambivalent smile and androgynous, mighty form, she is reminiscent of Michelangelo\u2019s oracles in the Sistine Chapel. Shifting sands \u2026 The setting is Estoril, where the artist went to school during the second world war, when Portugal was neutral territory. The town was coming into its own as a high-class tourist destination and as a centre for both Nazi and allied spies. Sweet death \u2026 Above a sunbathing Aryan poster-girl, a death-headed figure worthy of James Ensor stalks the sands, while a man gets cosy with a child-sized figure with receding hair. The composition is balanced, but everything else is out of whack. Once upon a time \u2026 This 2004 work is typical Rego, conjuring an open-ended folk tale from shadowy, everyday power struggles. Generally, though, she has preferred more brutal fare: twisted tales where women might eat their children. Paula Rego: Obedience and Defiance, MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, Saturday 15 June to 22 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
