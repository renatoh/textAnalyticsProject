The environmental elite, led by Zac Goldsmith and featuring celebs such as Sting and Sienna Miller, preach the horrors of carbon footprints and airport expansions. The Prime Minister wants to get in on the act. But have they sampled, I wonder, the torture of train delays, bruised local produce and limited mobile phone coverage? We have spent the past fortnight in East Prawle, a seaside village on the southernmost tip of Devon where Kate Bush and Jennie Bond have holiday homes. Its unique topography has made East Prawle a favourite with the Manic Organic crowd: travel by car is arduous and mobile phone coverage available only to those who risk balancing on top of a bench on the village green. Many of the cottages have electricity by the pound meter, no broadband and no television. Ours didn't even have a telephone line. For about 10 days, this Rousseau-like simplicity delights. The teenagers couldn't text constantly and had to play charades after supper. The grown-ups felt virtuous after yet another two-hour trek. The lovely feeling began to wear off when contacting friends meant long waits for my turn while media execs barked about contracts and deadlines on the bench on the village green. I quickly wearied of the Manic Organic mentality that infects locals and visitors. Talk at the pubs was of Crocs vs sandals and of Devon's sterling recycling record (the county ranks among the most environmentally conscientious in the UK, with 40 per cent of refuse recycled). The weekly refuse collectors studied each transparent bag left by our gate with forensic care and turned down one because they'd spotted a small glass jar; back came the bulging bag into our crowded kitchen. Green conventions are as inflexible as their countless regulations. Driving 20 minutes to the nearest supermarket was a sin, so we were reduced to a diet of local vegetables and fish; no criminal air miles but plenty of mildew and bruised fruit. Coming down by train was 'sound'; it didn't matter that I got back to London hours later than scheduled. I admitted to missing my power shower and was told sharply that baths are more energy-efficient. Anyone who hinted at deviation from the norm was browbeaten into submission: you are either in the tent (accepting communal showers and wrinkled veg) or you're out. The moral divide could not have been clearer. No one wants the polar caps to melt, but those who listen to their environmental conscience should know that their programme is fine in small bursts on short holidays. In terms of life-long rules and habits, though, it's as impractical as walking everywhere. One to dine out on The Restaurant stars Raymond Blanc, the restaurateur behind Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons, judging a group of wannabe chefs. Blanc's TV appearance comes as a surprise: for years, he had dismissed rival Gordon Ramsay for being a TV chef. Blanc also seemed convinced that Ramsay was in awe of his own 'serious' cuisine. During an interview with Jan Moir, whose website www.areyoureadytoorder.co.uk features an excoriating review of Le Manoir, the Frenchman claimed that Ramsay was a fan, full of admiration for Blanc's talent. 'When he found out that I knew Ramsay,' Moir tells me, 'he kept badgering me to confirm that Gordon had praised him. It was very embarrassing, but in the end, I thought, \"He cooks overpriced food in a suburban blister of a conservatory and not even the talc in the bedrooms is fresh - he deserves it.\" So I said, \"Actually, Gordon says you're nothing but a f***ing two-faced French twat.\"'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
