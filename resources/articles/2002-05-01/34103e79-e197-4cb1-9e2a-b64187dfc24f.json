Absolutely, I thought: overrated, you drink too much, and somebody else usually ends up getting what you wanted. Or maybe he meant it was like Christmas because it was bound to disappoint, having become invested with a mythic significance its history does not warrant. More likely, the Madness front man merely meant the Cup final was, you know, a bit special. In fact, as he was talking on the BBC, which has been in the forefront of the Keep the FA Cup Special campaign ever since it acquired the rights, that is almost certainly what he meant. Like many of us of his vintage, what marked out Cup final day as special for the Chelsea-supporting TV personality was the chance to watch television first thing in the morning. It must be difficult for a younger generation that has grown up with a vast choice of viewing at breakfast time - only this week Channel Four launched a new breakfast show whose sole selling point appears to be that it dares to put a colon into the middle of a wo:rd - to understand how special TV with your cornflakes was to people like Suggs and me. And Christmas morning and Cup final day were the only occasions on which we were allowed this guilty pleasure. Pleasure, actually, might be pitching it a bit strong, since one of those Cup final build-up programmes of old, apparently, was Lennie Bennett's FA Cup Punchlines on ITV, evidence of which was unearthed by the BBC for its clips show, There's Only One FA Cup, in an extraordinary act of retrospective revenge against the corporation's former Cup-final day rival. Not that the BBC had anything to be too smug about, since its own example of what passed for pre-final entertainment was It's a Cup Final Knockout from 1975 when supporters of the finalists, West Ham and Fulham, competed to bung soaking sponges into various football-related edifices. There's Only One FA Cup did well to dig up two of the Knockout participants. I particularly enjoyed the testimony of the chap who said there was a break in the recording during which they were milling around wondering what to do, when they saw Stuart Hall \"leading the way at the bar\", and so decided to follow his fine example, as a result of which some of them would have had difficulty walking straight even without the comedy shoes, the high wire, and the sloshing buckets of water they had to carry around. As the afternoon wore on, keeping dry became a real problem for those contestants who had followed Stuart into the bar - and then they had the buckets and soaking sponges to contend with as well. The programme had a longish section on the 1975 final, which was in fact the first Cup final I attended, and which lived up to expectations about as much as Christmas dinner does after the days of shopping and hours of cooking. I remember it as a drab affair - the match, not Christmas dinner - enlivened only by Alan Taylor's two predatory strikes. The Arsenal-Ipswich final a few years later was similarly prosaic, and also featured prominently. What these two rather poor finals had were unlikely heroes in West Ham's Taylor and Ipswich's Roger Osborne, both of whom have been the subject of countless where-are-they-now features ever since. Taylor, as has been well documented, now owns a newsagent shop in East Anglia, from where he revealed that he regards his brace at Wembley as \"probably\" the highlight of his career. What does he mean, \"probably\"? Is it a close-run contest between those two goals at Wembley and the morning the Sunday Times arrived without the supplements? Barry Davies was spot on when he said FA Cup heroes plucked from the lower leagues like Taylor, or home-grown like Osborne and Southampton's Bobby Stokes, were almost certainly a thing of the past. Why waste time and money growing your own footballers, when you can import them ready-made from Scandinavia or Holland? Other than that, though, it seems to me that FA Cup final day is much as it ever was. About one in five finals is a classic, the same proportion are stinkers, and the rest are much like this year's - half-decent football matches that do not quite justify the build-up. But then what would, especially when the preliminaries include a marvellous performance by Ricky Gervais from the sit-com The Office? In his character of David Brent, manager of paper distributors Wernham Hogg, Gervais offered management tips to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Claudio Ranieri: \"You've got to boost your players. It's important. You know, like, 'Mr Seaman, you are the greatest goalie in the world. Course your hair doesn't look silly. Course moustaches are still fashionable - in the north.' Or 'How do you know it's you they're booing, Mr Jokanovic?'\" I cannot say for sure, but this struck me as a distinct improvement on Tarby and Kenny Lynch of blessed memory. Cup finals, like Christmas, pop music, or sit-coms, are always said to be not what they used to be. But we forget that for every Fawlty Towers there was a Love Thy Neighbour, jokes from which, interestingly enough, are still being used in Stan Boardman's act. martin@kelner.demon.co.uk \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
