From Indian dosa to Ethiopian injera, Vietnamese b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o to Russian blini, the world loves a pancake, but perhaps nowhere more than the US, where fluffy stacks drenched with maple syrup are the weekend breakfast of choice for millions \u2013 not least because they\u2019re simplicity itself to make. Prep 5 min Cook 10 min Makes About 10 45g butter, plus extra for frying 115g plain flour 115g fine cornmeal/polenta \u00bc tsp salt 2 tbsp caster sugar 1 tsp baking powder \u00bd tsp bicarbonate of soda 100ml whole milk 300ml buttermilk 1 egg 1 Organise your toppings Turn the oven on low and put a wire cooling rack inside, to warm up. This is to keep the first pancakes warm while you cook the rest, so if you plan to serve them up straight from the pan, skip this step. Prepare your toppings \u2013 see steps 7-9, if you fancy them. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small pan. 2 Mix the dry ingredients Put the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, baking powder and bicarb into a large bowl and whisk to combine. You can use all plain flour if you don\u2019t have cornmeal, but the corn gives the pancakes a lovely, yellow colour and a sweet flavour, as well as making them slightly crisp. It\u2019s often in the Caribbean section of supermarkets, or look for polenta instead, which is the same thing. 3 Add the wet ingredients Measure the milk and buttermilk into a jug, then crack the egg on top. Beat this all together until it\u2019s well mixed, then stir in two tablespoons of the melted butter. Make a dip in the top of the dry ingredients (the flour, etc), then pour the milk mix into it. Stir just until you can see no more dry patches, then stop; if you stir it too much, your pancakes will be tough. 4 Prepare the frying pan Put a large, heavy frying pan on the hob over a medium heat, and brush all over with a thin layer of melted butter, so it\u2019s completely covered. Once it feels hot when you hold your hand above the pan, you\u2019re ready to cook. Put the bowl of pancake batter near the hob. 5 Start cooking Use a large spoon to dollop circles of batter of whatever size you\u2019d like (they\u2019re normally about 5-8cm diameter) into the pan, leaving enough room between them so they don\u2019t run into each other \u2013 you won\u2019t be able to do them all at once. Cook until the pancakes begin to look dry and bubbly on top, which, depending on the size of your pan, should take about three minutes. 6 Flip and finish cooking As they become ready, flip all the pancakes over using a palette knife or tongs, and cook on the other side for a couple of minutes, until golden brown. Serve immediately, or carefully arrange them on the rack in the oven to keep warm while you cook the rest of the batter. 7 Top with maple syrup and bacon \u2026 These pancakes are lovely with a drizzle of maple or golden syrup or honey, and a knob of butter, but there are other delicious things to serve with them, too. A few rashers of bacon are a classic accompaniment \u2013 you can cook this under a hot grill until crisp, or fry it in a pan with just a dash of oil, if you prefer, turning it once halfway. 8 \u2026 or fruit To add some fruit to your breakfast, beyond a scatter of berries or slices of apple, make a quick compote by heating 500g fresh (or frozen and defrosted) berries in a saucepan with four tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a simmer and bubble gently for three minutes, then taste (remember, it will be hot!) and add more sugar, if you like. This is good with thick yoghurt. 9 \u2026 or chocolate To make a chocolate sauce for pudding pancakes, break 100g chocolate (dark works best) into pieces and put in a saucepan with 150ml water. Heat gently, stirring to melt the chocolate, then stir in 60g sugar until dissolved. Turn up the heat a bit and simmer until the sauce is thick. Pour over the pancakes and top with sliced banana, flaked almonds and ice-cream, if you have it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
