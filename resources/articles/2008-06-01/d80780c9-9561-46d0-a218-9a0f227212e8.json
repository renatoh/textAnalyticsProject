Not only does FE seem to have more quangos, but they get culled more frequently, too. The latest addition to the \"quangocracy\", to be named today by the skills minister, Bill Rammell, looks like a slash-and-splice job. Two bodies, the Centre for Excellence in Leadership (CEL) and the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA), have been bound together into one. The former had been around for barely four years and the latter had notched up two. That is the other feature that sets further education apart. The quangos Labour has set up for it in the past decade have rarely been allowed long lives. Dame Ruth Silver, chair of the new quango, accepts that further education sees a more frequent coming and going of agencies than the school or university sectors. \"There's a very good reason for that,\" she says. \"Further education is the adaptive layer in the education system. Schools are statutory and protected by law. Universities are selective and protected by their royal charters. FE is none of that, and we have to change with society - and we do, rather brilliantly.\" FE has always changed with the demands on it, she says. \"We started with an industrial slant. We were the mechanics institutes. We trained the workforce. Then in the days of unemployment and migration we were agents of inclusion. And now it's both.\" But the rate of change of quangos has been faster in the past decade. Some people say the sector is never allowed to get on with things. \"People might say that, but if you're observant, reflective and analytical, then the proposition makes sense about us being the adaptive layer,\" says Silver. But the CEL and QIA were surely not granted enough time to settle down. \"That's one way of seeing it. I have another way,\" she says. \"A lot has changed in these four years. The joy of FE is that it's so fleet of foot.\" The winning feature of the new body, which finished the interview process for the 12-strong board only on Friday, is that the sector will control it, she says. \"The new body will be sector-led, and it's the time for self-regulation in FE. This is highly significant.\" The Conservatives do not see it this way. \"The system is immensely clogged up with all this centralised control and micromanagement,\" says John Hayes, shadow skills spokesman. \"One accepts that when there's public money being spent that there should be ways of guaranteeing quality and probity, but you don't need a very big bureaucracy.\" In 2005, the Foster review of the future role of colleges pronounced that FE had \"a galaxy of oversight, inspection and accreditation bodies. They need to be rationalised, coordinated and focused.\" According to Hayes, Labour has half-heartedly accepted this but has ended up with even more agencies. \"They are abolishing the Learning and Skills Council and replacing it with a series of other agencies with no savings in manpower or cash,\" he says. \"You now risk just as much bureaucracy but less coherence.\" Mick Fletcher, a further education consultant, sees a simple explanation for the plethora of quangos. \"It's because government feels able to interfere in FE and the quango is the instrument by which it seeks to exercise control. It treats schools and HE with rather more respect.\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills says: \"FE colleges are leaders in their community. Not just in education but as institutions that can drive economic development and regeneration. This means that the FE sector impacts on a range of different agendas - coming into contact with many different 'quangos'.\" Nonetheless the government is committed to simplifying the sector wherever possible, she said. \"We have taken steps to clarify the role of organisations working across the FE service - reducing the number where appropriate. And we have sought to ensure that the sector has more ownership of these new organisations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
