The government-backed 150-page travel guide and fanzine provides tips on city orientation, travel links between venues, match fixtures and things to see and do, that don't involve drinking, chanting or mentioning the war. However anyone who hopes the guide will convert your average England fan into a culture vulture will be disappointed. The \"eating and drinking\" section - which, due to the onus placed on the latter might be better labelled the \"drinking and drinking\" section - enjoys a prominent place in each city guide, second only to information on the stadium and transport links. \"Despite Frankfurt being equal to New York and Paris in terms of its culture with 109 galleries, 33 theatres and 39 museums, there is little else to do in the city centre that isn't heavily centred around eating and drinking and watching the world go by,\" states the first chapter of the guide, which was researched by members of the Football Supporters Federation (FSF). Being launched alongside the guide is the mobile \"fans' embassy\" - a vehicle which, armed with a team of FSF volunteers, will follow the England squad around Germany, parking itself in town and city centres where the team is playing. The idea follows on from the first fans' embassy of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. An embassy has been present at each of England's away qualifiers and friendlies over the last two years and serves to offer information and advice for football fans. Travelling fans can also sign up for text message updates and make use of the FSA's 24-hour telephone helpline. \u00b7 The Free Lions England Fans' Guide to Germany 2006, is backed by the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the Football Association and is not available for purchase. It can only be obtained by downloading a voucher from the Football Supporters Federation website and taking it to a Nationwide building society branch in exchange for a copy. There will also be 100,000 free copies of the guide; 25,000 of these will be sent out to members of the FA's English fans ticketing scheme and rest will be distributed on a first come first served basis at Nationwide branches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
