Steve Jobs declared last night that Apple had enjoyed a \"phenomenal quarter\", after it smashed analyst forecasts. Revenues rose 88% to $15.7bn (\u00a310.2bn) in the three months to 26 June, with net quarterly profit up 78% at $3.25bn. Jobs also insisted that the iPhone 4 was the most successful launch in the company's history despite the well-documented problems with the handset's antenna. Shaw Wu, analyst at Kaufman Bros, said the results were \"spectacular\". The company sold 3.47 million Macs worldwide, and 3.27 million iPads. \"iPad is off to a terrific start, more people are buying Macs than ever before, and we have amazing new products still to come this year,\" said Jobs. Apple's results were released after the close of trading on Wall Street, and its shares jumped by more than 2.5% in after-hours trading. Apple's Mac computers have taken something of a back seat in recent months, with attention being mainly devoted to the iPad tablet computer and the new iPhone. Last night's results suggest a growing trend. \"There is a virtuous circle going on with Apple, as customers who are exposed to the iPhone and iPad also want a Mac,\" said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners in a research note. Tim Cook, Apple's chief operating officer, said that around half the Macs sold during the quarter went to new users. He also revealed that 50% of Fortune 100 companies in America are either testing or deploying the iPad. Apple has deferred revenue of $175m to cover the cost of providing cases to address antenna problems with the iPhone 4, but denied that the issue had hit sales. \"Let me be clear about this \u2014 we are selling every unit we can make currently,\" said Cook. \"My phone is ringing off the hook with people who want more supply.\" Sales of the iPhone fell slightly quarter-on-quarter, to 8.4 million from 8.75 million, as customers waited for the launch of the iPhone 4 in late June. The figures also suggested that the iPod's best days are well behind it. Apple sold just over 9.4 million units, the lowest figure since the summer of 2006. Apple predicted that revenues in the current quarter would hit $18bn, which is higher than analyst forecasts. Some critics have claimed Apple has been deliberately restricting the availability of the iPad and iPhone 4 to push up demand, a charge Cook robustly denied: \"We are selling both products as fast as we can make them, so we are quoting longer lead times than we'd like, and we're working round the clock to alleviate this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
