Aged 48, hair going - all right, gone - grey, a motorbike licence, a month off work and a very understanding wife. Thus it is that today my Hampstead doctor friend John (who also has a very understanding wife) and me take the afternoon Virgin flight to New York. And tomorrow we pick up a couple of Harley-Davidson Road Kings from a dealer on Long Island and start driving across America. Coast to coast, sea to shining sea. More than three weeks through the heart of the United States on a one-way road that will be at least 3,500 miles long. So it's two sad middle-aged bastards on big bikes trying to avoid their mid-life crises by pretending they're Peter Fonda. Or it's two middle-aged blokes setting off for one of the times of their lives, excited like children, unable to sleep and wondering, for the umpteenth time, how many pairs of underpants to pack (one on and three more - apparently they dry quickly if you tie them to the bike). There are real anxieties too. Neither of us has ever driven anything like this distance before. Will we fall off? Will we run out of conversation? Will we remain friends? Do his feet smell? Does he snore? (You gather we will be sharing motel rooms.) And then there are the bigger issues. Will we go mad after hours on the road or will we emulate Robert Pirsig and come up with something like his 1974 masterpiece, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance? Fat chance, really. The longest piece I have ever written was 3,000 words for the Face, and that, funnily enough, was a profile of a cyclist. But he pedalled. Dr John is the gadget man on this trip. He's got a GPS machine which means we can pinpoint where we are to within a few yards anywhere in the country. He has also managed to fathom how to work the smart mobile, a Sony Ericsson T68i, which we have borrowed. It has a camera attachment, and you can email the photos to anywhere. The evidence will be seen here. He's also got a watch which incorporates a compass and an altimeter as well as all the usual stuff. Plus there's the regular digital camera, the handheld computer on which we can write our stories, and the APS camera. Clothes have been kept to a minimum because everything has to be packed into the panniers and there's not much space. The aforementioned underpants are accompanied by four pairs of socks, a T-shirt, a polo shirt, a Hawaiian shirt, two long-sleeved shirts, a jersey, a pair of jeans, a pair of chinos, a pair of shorts, walking boots for riding, docksiders and trainers, and a new leather jacket. The latter is designed in what is called Brando-style: that is, the zip goes out towards the shoulder and the collar clips back. Then there is the music. Mine is all ancient - the music from Easy Rider (obviously), some Eagles (we hope to stand \"on the corner of Winslow, Arizona\", a line from Take It Easy), some Otis Redding, Willie Nelson, The Doors and some country. OK, OK. I'm not asking you to listen to it. A helmet and waterproofs are provided by Lighthouse Harley-Davidson, the people from whom we are hiring the bikes, who are part of the authorised Harley-Davidson Rental programme. We had a go on a Harley last week at the Harley dealer just off the North Circular in Chingford. At 1450ccs Road Kings are big machines, but they were easier to handle than we had thought and they felt comfy. They'll have to be. At least we feel less likely to make prats of ourselves by dropping them on Lighthouse's forecourt - although this is not improbable. From there, if we stay upright, the basis of our route is US50, a road that Time magazine called the \"Backbone of America\" a few years ago. Up until last week, having pored over maps on the kitchen table for a couple of months, the plan was to head south. But then we went off the south and decided to head almost due east to begin with. US50 goes through a dozen states. According to Road Trip USA (Moon Travel Handbooks, \u00a317.99) we will travel through hundreds of small, time-worn towns, the great majority of which remain untouched by the modern onslaught of Wal-Marts and fast food franchises. Along the route are some of the country's most magnificent landscapes - the Appalachian, Rocky and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, the endless farmlands of the Great Plains and the desiccated deserts of Utah and Nevada. We plan to head south after crossing the Rockies to take in Monument Valley and the Grand Canyon before dipping our toes in the Pacific in Santa Monica when we finally run out of road. Then we ride up the California coast to San Francisco. Out there on US50, which is also dubbed the Loneliest Road, is the loneliest phone box, a solar powered booth somewhere in Utah. We hope to find it and lots more. Get that motor running."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
