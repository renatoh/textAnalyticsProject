The Which? survey tested 60 takeaway lamb curries and minced lamb kebabs and found that 24 of them contained other meats such as beef and chicken. Seven of the samples contained no lamb at all, the tests found. The meat in five samples could not be identified because it had been so highly processed. The study adds to growing concern about what appears to be the widespread mislabelling of meat. This year it emerged that a third of foods tested by West Yorkshire councils were mislabelled, with meat products most likely to be adulterated. Last month Leicester trading standards officers said almost half of meat products they had checked, including burgers, curries and sausages, were adulterated. The Food Standards Agency said it had now asked for new tests on lamb takeaways to be conducted as a priority by local authorities. The tests will be funded out of the existing \u00a32m budget the watchdog makes available to local authorities to check the authenticity of foods on sale in their areas. The FSA chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, said: \"Substitution of lamb for cheaper meats in takeaway food is unacceptable and we are working closely with local authorities to ensure robust action is taken against any businesses misleading their customers.\" Which? chose areas for sampling where local authority testing had been reduced. An FSA review of results submitted from local authorities around the country last year found that 43 out of 145 samples of lamb takeaway meals contained meat other than lamb, including chicken, beef and turkey. In 25 samples the meat was entirely beef. The Trading Standards Institute has said budgets to detect food fraud have been heavily cut. The trading standards workforce survey found that by 2016 most services in England and Wales will have had their budgets cut by an average of 40% compared with their 2010 levels. Which? said it was shocked by the level of fraud it had uncovered. \"The government, local authorities and the FSA need to take tougher action to crack down on offenders. This is vital to restoring trust in the industry,\" said the executive director Richard Lloyd. Professor Chris Elliott, who is leading a review of the horsemeat scandal for the Department of Environment, said he was not surprised. \"Whenever issues about food contamination and adulteration are looked for in a serious way, they are found. Without rigorous monitoring programmes, cheats will always try to take advantage,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
