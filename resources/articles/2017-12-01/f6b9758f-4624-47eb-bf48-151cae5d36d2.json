The fridge belonged to a milk bar in the Melbourne suburb of Westmeadows, and for a flat fee of $5 \u2013 and a promise that he could eat anything he wanted \u2013 Preston got to rotate its contents after school. It made him feel like a local legend: the kid who visited the milk bar so often, he got a job there. \u201cEveryone I knew growing up went into that milk bar,\u201d he says. \u201cI got to see the behind the scenes ... it was a cool little status thing.\u201d On Friday, the Melbourne-based artist launched his own tribute to the Australian suburban milk bar experience: a room-size replica full of faded, long-gone snacks, each handmade from plywood. \u201cI went the extra mile and built the whole shop. You\u2019re standing inside the artwork rather than standing looking at it on a wall.\u201d Preston has created more than 500 handmade items, from magazines and chip packets, to wooden Panadol containers and dish soap. Most are 2D, painted on, and mounted upright like small trophies. \u201cA bag of Twisties has a natural bulge to it that doesn\u2019t work in a rectangle,\u201d he says. It\u2019s an artwork primarily concerned with nostalgia and aesthetics, but Preston says the experience of remaking hundreds of retro items also revealed a lot about how consumer goods, multinational companies and food had changed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good exercise in reminding myself,\u201d he says. \u201cThese products change over time and we don\u2019t really notice it. Big companies change the branding, chip away at it. A can of Fanta from 1996 is very different to one now \u2013 most things you buy these days have extra things attached to the design\u2013 the \u2018limited release chocolate caramel\u2019 version of the Mars bar or whatever. \u201cA dozen flavours of soft drink now seem silly when there\u2019s basically a dozen flavours of Red Bull you can get. The beauty I\u2019ve seen, in making them all, is there was a very level playing field [back then]. Things weren\u2019t designed to trick you into thinking they were something else.\u201d Callum Preston\u2019s Milk Bar, which will live in Collingwood\u2019s RVCA Corner Gallery, is also an attempt to recreate the sense of community he discovered as a child, \u201cin the teenage gap where you\u2019re old enough to have freedom, but too young to go to a pub or club\u201d. \u201cWhen I was a kid, the guy who ran the milk bar was kind of the neighbourhood directory. In those suburbs you\u2019re a bit of a local gatekeeper I guess.\u201d Callum used plywood (\u201cThe A4 of building materials\u201d), and cut, glued and painted each piece by hand. He spent a lot of time researching, but ultimately every item was created mostly from his own memory, and they are not exact replicas. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely liberties taken throughout the show,\u201d he says. \u201cI tried to work in a limited colour palette \u2013 not everything has to be the exact right shade. I also tried to not use the same paint twice. \u201cWhat I love about milk bars is that they\u2019re not intentionally set-dressed to look that way: it\u2019s just dysfunction,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever the chip companies send them, they put them on the wall. The ice-cream brands might want the fridge painted a certain way. \u201cYou get a real clash of colours and signs, it\u2019s like a mini Las Vegas. As opposed to a modern cafe, where you would consult with people. It\u2019s got an aesthetic that is unintentional.\u201d But while a lot has changed, the milk bar where Preston first worked at remains. \u201cI visited it recently,\u201d he says. \u201cThe original owner is a few generations gone, it\u2019s been sold on and sold on. But the store itself is still there. \u201cI imagine there\u2019s probably people who used to be kids in the neighbourhood who grew up going there, who still have a connection to it and shop there. There\u2019s a supermarket now just down the road, but it seems to be standing up.\u201d When asked to pick a favourite item from the time \u2013 the one that brings back the most nostalgia \u2013 he can\u2019t. \u201cEveryone has a product that they reminisce on ... but not for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted the whole store, so I built the whole store.\u201d Callum Preston\u2019s Milk Bar is open 2, 3, 8, 9 and 10 December, from 11am \u2013 4pm, at RVCA Corner Gallery, Collingwood, Melbourne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
