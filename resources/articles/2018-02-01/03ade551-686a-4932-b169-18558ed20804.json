Still in early 17th-century Virginia, with the first English settlers. Alice and Verity are taking a stroll inland into the New World. Both are hitched now, and Alice is heavily pregnant. Verity would like to be too, but her useless husband is a drunk and can\u2019t live up to his name: Meredith Rutter. Alice slips, she tumbles, screaming, down the bank and into the river, where she has an impromptu water-birth and delivers Jamestown\u2019s first-ever boy. You don\u2019t see that on One Born Every Minute. And he\u2019s helped into the world by Maria, an enslaved midwife. Yes, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s slavery here now; the slaves are picking the colonists\u2019 Golden Virginia for them. It\u2019s one in, one out, though, because here\u2019s Samuel, Jocelyn\u2019s fella, dead on the river bank, a vulture having a little peck at one of his eyes. Was it the indigenous people who killed him? Perhaps. Relations with them seem to have soured since the last season. Not that Jocelyn seems at all bothered by her loss \u2013 until she finds out that losing her husband means losing her house and everything else as well. \u201cWithout a husband, a woman simply has no position in Virginia,\u201d Temperance, the governor\u2019s wife, tells her. Girl power hasn\u2019t broken America yet \u2026 Hold up though, Jocelyn\u2019s not going to take this lying down. \u201cSir, you may cut me down,\u201d she hisses to the tobacco company man. \u201cBut not so low that my nails cannot reach your eyes.\u201d Ouch, you have to be careful of your eyes around here, what with the vultures and with Jocelyn. Pedro, another of Jamestown\u2019s enslaved inhabitants, is getting a bit cocky too. I think it\u2019s a race between him and Jocelyn as to who ends up running the place. Maybe both. Jamestown shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously. Nor as a history lesson. Don\u2019t be fooled by the authentic brutality and dirt, or by any accuracy there might be in the events, stuff that actually happened. Look at the storylines and the attitudes, and what you see is modern-day soap opera dressed in period costume with a sailing ship parked up at the quay. Once you accept that, it\u2019s actually quite fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
