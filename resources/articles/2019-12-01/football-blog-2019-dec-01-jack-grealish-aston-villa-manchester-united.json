United spent more than \u00a3100m on two members of their present back four in the summer, yet you would never have guessed from their uncertain start. Aston Villa took the lead in the 11th minute, and even by that early stage Harry Maguire was in the book for wrestling Anwar El Ghazi to the floor after being beaten by the winger for a second time, Victor Lindel\u00f6f had been dispossessed on the edge of his own area by Wesley and Jack Grealish had been fouled twice by Andreas Pereira. Within a couple more minutes Fred, too, received a caution for his second cynical hack at the Villa captain, all of which suggested United had identified Grealish as a potential threat. Fair enough, you might think. Not for nothing has Grealish become the most fouled player in the Premier League this season, and if he continues in his current form the clamour for an England call-up will not die down either. Yet when El Ghazi pumped over a cross from the right, injuring himself in the process of delivering it, Grealish was allowed all the time and space he needed on the left to measure his angles and put the ball in the one place where David de Gea could not reach it. Pereira was particularly slow in getting tight enough to Grealish to prevent a shot, as if he imagined the talented Villa player would be stuck for something to do with the ball if left to his own devices. Aaron Wan-Bissaka should have been around to help out, but he was caught out of position under the cross and found ball-watching as Grealish easily stepped round Pereira to make space for a right-foot curler. Pereira made some amends with the precision cross that allowed Rashford to equalise before the interval, but the Villa defence had been handling the United attack quite comfortably until Tyrone Mings misjudged a clearance to put Tom Heaton under pressure, the goalkeeper conceding a corner his side were unable to fully clear. The Villa goalkeeper made a good save early in the second half from Wan-Bissaka and when United briefly took the lead it was another defender who put the ball over the line, Lindel\u00f6f taking advantage of an unintentional assist from Wesley, whose attempt at a clearing header only sent the ball into the centre half\u2019s path. United were able to hold their lead for all of two minutes before another defensive lapse let Villa straight back. Mings supplied a tidy enough finish when he intercepted a Matt Targett cross that was probably intended for Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet, though he would have been offside by a distance had not Brandon Williams hung back just long enough to play him on. The Villa fans at the same end vented their displeasure at VAR being used to check its validity, though here was an example of the technology being used sensibly and correctly. Mings looked offside, but wasn\u2019t, and though the on-field officials did well in real time there was no harm in making certain. A draw was a fair result, neither side doing quite enough to deserve victory, but what summed the game up best was Luke Shaw coming on in the 79th minute and still finding time to join the list of players booked for fouling Grealish. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s players might have done most of the attacking in the second half but Villa created the best chance to win the game, Grealish somehow managing to miss the target when Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet\u2019s pass had presented him with an open goal in the second half. Here is a player who can bend the ball in from the angle of the area and worry a goalkeeper of De Gea\u2019s ability with free-kicks from outside the box, yet struggles with a tap-in from the six-yard line. United should consider themselves lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
