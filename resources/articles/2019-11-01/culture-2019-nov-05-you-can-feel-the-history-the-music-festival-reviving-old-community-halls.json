It took weeks and weeks.\u201d The hall, which first opened in 1955, is a 50-minute drive from Toowoomba, and serves a town of just 60 or so people. It was originally lit by kerosene lamp, and cost \u00a3422 to build \u2013 with money raised by the community of mostly cotton farmers. One fundraising dance, held in a local\u2019s barn, featured a chocolate wheel, pillow fight and a \u201cbelle of the ball\u201d, according to records. It made \u00a343. In a swimming carnival, one Mr VW Fysh donated a duck for the \u201ccatch the duck in the water competition\u201d; other fundraising events included tractor races, tug-of-war and \u201cthrow the broom\u201d. More than six decades later, the rural Queensland hall \u2013 which still stands handsome and strong, with a corrugated iron roof, hardwood floor and warm panelled wooden walls \u2013 has seen grand balls, boxing tournaments, movie nights and bowls, although these days is mostly used for craft groups and meetings. But last week it hosted something more novel: a live gig, for the first time in maybe a decade. To a crowded room, which included a grey-haired lady in bright blue nylon stockings who spent the concert knitting, three acts belted out their songs. Decorated with bunting and coloured bulbs strung up from the ceiling, the evening was part of the Festival of Small Halls: a series of seasonal tours that take local and international bands through rural and remote regions, and has been running in Australia since 2013. \u201cThere was a long period when the halls were dormant. People want to see live music, musicians want to play and the venue is there,\u201d says Ash Bell, 39, one half of the Aussie folk duo Ash Bell and Sara Tindley. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing in a hall from forever ago. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d \u201cThe hall breathes,\u201d gushes Tindley, 52. \u201cYou can feel the history.\u201d Produced for Australia by Woodfordia Inc, which also put on Woodford folk festival, the Festival of Small Halls has three goals: to grow the market for folk music; to provide access to high-quality live music in remote areas; and to carve out a regional touring circuit for the music industry. \u201cRegional Australia doesn\u2019t have a touring circuit in the way that Europe and America does: venues and deals aren\u2019t set up to support artists,\u201d says the festival\u2019s producer Eleanor Rigden. \u201cWe work with these [communities] for at least six months to support them to put on a show.\u201d The idea is simple: by showing the communities who manage the halls that live music is an option, a touring circuit will slowly be carved out, which, in turn, will help provide space for music across the country to flourish and grow. Critically, it will also show bigger acts that these rural areas are worth visiting and have the infrastructure to host them. \u201cNormally when international acts come to Australia they hit up the cities and that\u2019s it: done,\u201d says Emily Kelly, 27, of Scottish acoustic duo The Jellyman\u2019s Daughter, who will travel this November by bus everywhere from regional New South Wales to Queensland to Victoria. The festival is \u201ctaking the initiative to go to these places\u201d. The seasonal tours usually encompass 20 dates over five weeks, with most shows featuring a local act (from highland dancing to teenage singer-songwriters), followed by touring bands: one international, one Australian. Each tour is non-profit, with state governments, local councils and communities subsidising the events to help keep prices low. In Pampas, tickets cost just $15. But if supporting the growth of Australian music is one aim, so is a celebration of the halls themselves, the oldest of which date to pre-federation. Of the Pampas memorial hall, Ted Kelly says, \u201cIt\u2019s a good solid building.\u201d It is also a hub for a community under considerable strain as Australia suffers a crippling drought. \u201cWe haven\u2019t grown a crop for 18 months now and we\u2019re hanging out for some good rain,\u201d says his 64-year-old son, Graeme, a farmer who is also president of the hall committee. \u201cTo have this many people on a Thursday night in the middle of the drought just shows there\u2019s still some community spirit around.\u201d \u201cA community hall is a reflection of a community,\u201d agrees 55-year-old local Michael Hegarty, as he mans the sausage sizzle and hands out $1 cups of coffee. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t keep the hall in good nick, it would be the start of the fragmentation.\u201d It isn\u2019t just extreme weather that is proving a challenge, but the ageing population. Graeme Kelly sighs. \u201cEveryone is getting old,\u201d he says, eyeing up the crowd of mostly seniors. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be looking for some new blood, which is going to be hard. Not a lot of young people round here anymore.\u201d For the moment, however, the Festival of Small Halls is providing some respite. \u201cThis is the pinnacle of touring Australia,\u201d insists Bell. \u201cBecause you are playing to people \u2013 you\u2019re not playing to massive rooms or auditoriums or huge festival audiences. You are playing to people who you can see, talk to and have a cup of tea with. You have to let yourself be hosted rather than think you\u2019re hosting them.\u201d \u2022 The spring tour of Festival of Small Halls takes the Jellyman\u2019s Daughter and Ash Bell &amp; Sara Tindley from Dorrigo to Queenscliff, through November. Upcoming summer tours travel from Mullum to Woodford; and Cygnet to Illawarra.
