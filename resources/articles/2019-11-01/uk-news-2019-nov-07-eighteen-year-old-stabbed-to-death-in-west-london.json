Officers were called at about 4.40pm on Thursday to reports of a stabbing at Hillingdon Civic Centre in High Street, Uxbridge. The victim was taken to hospital with a stab wound to his chest, but was pronounced dead less than an hour later. A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and remains in police custody for questioning. Another teenage boy suffered a non-life-threatening knife wound to his ear. An area inside the centre has been cordoned off by police and forensic teams are working at the scene. The victim is the 21st teenager to be murdered in London this year. DCI Noel McHugh, who is leading the investigation, said: \u201cThis is a tragic loss of life. A young man with his whole life ahead of him has been fatally attacked.\u201d He urged witnesses to contact police, and said the Metropolitan police were doing \u201ceverything we can to find those involved\u201d. Knife crime in the capital has soared in recent years, with 44,076 knife or sharp object offences recorded in the 12 months prior to June 2019 \u2013 the highest figure since comparable data was first collected in 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
