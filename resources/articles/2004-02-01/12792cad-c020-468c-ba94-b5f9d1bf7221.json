In the half light of falling slow and low cloud I would like to think that fun is at my fingertips - or at least my ski tips - but I remain unconvinced and make my way down the slope like a constipated coathanger. No wonder they lump me in the group of tentative, nervous skiers. The start of a four-day course to learn 'inner skiing', designed to take the fear out and put the fun back into being on the slopes, is quite definitely not working. It had sounded good over the breakfast table when coach Ian Prosser chatted us through the Inner Game philosophy, developed on the tennis court and now used in modern business management. 'Inner skiing is very simple,' he says. 'It suggests there is a natural ability to do things such as speak languages, walk, talk. Kids just learn but grown ups can't because they have a voice in their head that gives them a running commentary. We are going to make that running commentary quiet so your natural self can go out and learn.' Going round the table, we all say what we want to achieve that day. Virginia wants skiing to be less survival and more enjoyable, so she can reach lunchtime without that great feeling of relief that she can down skis for the rest of the day. And Tom wants more control - he manages to injure himself on most ski trips - while his girlfriend Rowena hasn't skied for 10 years and is seeking confidence. As for me, I seem to be the ideal guinea pig for Inner Skiing, having clocked up about five weeks' experience and a growing feeling that every time I clamber into the bindings, I am regressing rather than progressing. In the past, I've had more theory jammed into my head than you'd need to set up a special ski section in the library and none of it seems to be helping. So when Ian talks about 'learning through larking about', I like what I hear. Except that now we are on the slopes, I am not having fun. In fact, I feel really stupid, crouching down low on the traverse, then jumping up with arms in the air just before the turn to get a feel for the bouncy up-down-up movement. We do a few other exercises when Ian asks us to be conscious of how our shins feel on the front of the boots and tells us to move our weight from toe to toe rather than foot to foot. It doesn't feel revolutionary - most of what he's teaching us is stuff I've already covered in other lessons. And rather than being in 'the zone', that state of relaxed con centration that Tiger Woods seems to find so easily, I feel more like Eddie the Eagle or a member of the Jamaican bobsleigh team. But something is happening to my fellow skiers. Virginia gets to lunchtime still waxing lyrical about how much she is enjoying herself, and Rowena is finding her ski legs, talking of how it all clicked when Ian told her about the 'toe-to-toe' movement. At the end of the day, it is the same story - lightbulbs have pinged on for everyone but me. Only the luxury of Ferme de Montagne where I am staying cheers me. This boutique hotel on the slopes of Les Gets is taking ski accommodation to a new dimension, a cross-breed mixing the homely atmosphere of a chalet with the luxury of a five-star hotel. With a staff of nine to cater for 18 guests, it possibly has the highest ratio of staff to guests in the Alps. And it shows, with your every whim catered for by staff who address you by name and remember how you like your drinks. With an outdoor hot tub and a spa therapist imported from heaven, plus rooms containing everything from an espresso machine to an internet plug, it's hard to grumble about how tough it was on the slopes. I completely forget the day's trials as I wallow in the bath, which comes complete with huge bottles of Jo Malone products, before emerging for dinner. We are not talking everyday chalet fare here either - the menu, which changes daily, sports such delicacies as blue cheese souffle with pear and walnut, seared red mullet with dauphinoise and bouillabaisse and a white-chocolate souffle to die for. The only blot on the horizon is Ian, still reminding me of what is meant to be happening to my skiing. 'I think if you get a professional ski coach and an Inner Game ski coach, the latter will make more progress every time,' he tells me. 'I am very confident I can help anyone who wants to come.' Anyone but me, I think as I head off for a sleepless night, despite the amazingly comfy bed. The next day, I am prepared to do almost anything rather than go out on the piste. But the weather has cleared up, we can see what we are skiing down, and our small group heads off with Ian's partner, Paula, until the afternoon. Clocking up an enormous amount of mileage, we cruise easily down red runs I had fallen down the previous day. Paula is so patient and shares so many tips that I feel I'd like to stay with her for the rest of the day. But having teed me up, Paula lets Ian take over with a swing lesson in the afternoon. 'Skiing is all about rhythm; you've got to imagine you're swinging on the slopes. You can't feel a thing if you ain't got that swing', he tells us, demonstrating the position we are supposed to assume by making us resist as he pulls on the other end of our ski pole down the mountain. So we head off, our legs going pendulum-style down the hill, swinging for all we're worth to any tune we care to sing to ourselves. And that is when it all clicks into place. Suddenly, I realise that I am carving, driving the edge of my skis into the slope. It is a mini miracle - I could spout off about the theory of carv ing until I'm blue in the face but I've never actually been able to translate that into practise. And now I'm doing it without thinking, bubbling over with giggles as I swing down the mountain. It feels fantastic... though there are still a few niggling worries to deal with. Does my bum stick out as much as I think it does in this new position? I ask Ian but as soon as the question pops out of my mouth, I realise I should have known better - his Inner Game philosophy means his answer is vague: 'Does it? Does it feel right or not? Try skiing in different positions.' That's the heart of his teaching - not giving you the right answer, but teaching you to notice things yourself. Mercifully, Paula is there to reassure me in the way only a woman could. Which is the beauty of the Ian and Paula team. Sometimes Ian's happy-go-lucky Cockney attitude can be frustrating - 'if it doesn't feel right, you don't have to do it' - but then Paula steps in as the perfect antidote, giving some very helpful advice. There's another advantage to taking an Inner Skiing course at Ferme de Montagne - you get not only Ian and Paula, but two resident ski guides, enabling the 18 people staying there to split into groups of differing levels but always to be skiing with someone. You do, though, need to be prepared to be flexible - there are no fixed timetables or schedules, and some groups definitely get to see more of Ian than others. You must also be prepared for a few unexpected events. For instance, Ian took one group of three skiers up to one of the highest peaks only to ski off and force them to make their own way down, which they managed both successfully and jubilantly. 'I can't pinpoint exactly what we were taught, says Charles Porter, one of the skiers in that group. 'But I did find that somehow, I had an amazing amount of confidence.' My confidence returns, too. So when on the last day, we decide to zip down the slope in ski formation, singing oom-pah-pah at the top of our lungs and swinging our skis together, it feels really good. Even when I wipe out at the bottom of the slope and end in a muddled heap. There's a snowstorm blowing up and the visibility is worse than our first day on the slopes but I don't want to stop. In fact, I carry on with a small group cruising down my first powder without incident and hurtling down some pretty steep red runs before they drag me off the slopes to get to the airport in time. Now that's what I call a result.
