The man he tries to stop us from looking at could be the baddie in a James Bond movie - in a sleeveless top and shaven-headed, he seems to be the centre of attention. We're in Budva's Stari Grad, the old town, one of Montenegro's premier tourist destinations. Crumbling walls and tumbling bougainvillaea give the courtyard an ancient air, even though two of the old merchant houses have been renovated into bars. Two-dozen people are enjoying the ambience - medieval with a twist of modern, eastern European house music. It's just one of the many intimate piazzas that the alleyways converge on, as they meander along, leading tourists deeper into the maze. With a coastline extending south from the famed Dalmatian coast, Montenegro may well be the next Croatia waiting to be rediscovered. Apart from the war correspondents and \"mafija\", the Balkan wars kept everyone away during the 90s. But package tourists from the UK have already begun to return - a warning sign for those who want to go before it gets busy. The laid-back cousin to bigger, more aggressive Serbia in the new Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - \"Montenegrin\" was a byword for lazy in Tito's time - its 650,000 inhabitants haven't seen the violence that rocked the other five republics as Yugoslavia broke up. At any rate, no bombs were dropped here. Slightly larger than Wales, the country is a mass of forbidding mountains and fragrant pine forests. Those mountains frame Europe's southernmost fjord and almost 200 miles of stunning coastline. Beneath a piercing blue sky, nestling where azure Adriatic meets barren rock, Montenegro is a land of medieval walled towns and sleepy villages. Budva, our starting point, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1979, but has since been rebuilt perfectly. Getting lost in its labyrinthine alleys is the perfect antidote to rushing to a meeting on time. Outside the old town walls the harbour is like a less glamorous Puerto Banus or less busy Rhodes town. A long, L-shaped promenade drawn by the street lamps stretches around the bay, where boat masts nod gently on the oil-black sea. Further on we came to Budva's Bar Street, peopled by men with muscles and skinheads and girls in miniskirts, seemingly the hangout for Bosnian Serb thugs and their girlfriends. But you wouldn't find them at nearby Sveti Stefan, the islet fishing-village transformed into a playground for the rich. Its exclusive town-hotel was voted best in the world in 1969. Now that memory of the turbulent 90s is fading, so westerners are returning. Claudia Schiffer and Jeremy Irons number among recent guests, trailing the glitterati of its heyday, including our own Queen Elizabeth II. We opted to go further up the coast and follow an emperor, Franz Josef of the Habsburg dynasty. He used to stay in Kotor, now designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO. It's easy to see why. The high walls, narrow lanes and misshapen stone courtyards reflect the wealth and tastes of mariners from the 12th to 14th centuries, who appreciated Kotor's calm harbour. Relaxing by the sea further round the Boka Kotorska bay, I realise that being in Montenegro feels a bit like time-travel. Those old postcards I've seen from the 70s look like they were shot here, last week. The men wear the same swimming trunks, the cars are communist-era, and the people laze about as if that's all they have to do. From there, our boat potters across the bay into the harbour at Rose Porto. A few fishing boats bob in the harbour in front of a dozen empty-looking houses. Their paint peels in the unrelenting sunlight. At the unnamed cafe we feast on much needed cold beer, and a plate of bread, dried ham and cheese. We toast our simple feast with a clink of glasses and a cheer: \"Jivoli!\" Whether at a simple cafe or at a restaurant, like the Hellas in Kotor, or the Konoba, on the beach next to Budva's old town walls, Montenegro's food is simple and fantastic. Dried ham is on a par with Italy's prosciutto and appreciated by the many Italians who make the short skip across the water. Cheeses include \"sir iz ulja\", which literally means \"cheese with olive oil\" - a name that does not do it justice. With a light flavour, not dissimilar to mozzarella, its texture is chalky but the oil keeps it from being dry. It's also a cheese with romance - it's wind-dried in cages at the top of the mountain, our waiter at the Konoba, Ivan, said. The main course of finger mussels brought another story. \"These are illegal in Italy and Croatia. There they have eaten too many, so they must let them grow again. The mussels must live inside the rock for 15 years and then we can break the rock to get them out\". Longer and thinner than ordinary mussels, they are even softer to chew. Great food, a relaxed pace of life, clear seas framed by stunning mountain backdrops, and the odd (UN-wanted) criminal - what more could you ask for in a holiday destination? A place where you can get away from it all, and where some get away with it all perhaps. Rather than the new Croatia, Montenegro might just be central Europe's still unspoilt Costa del Sol.
