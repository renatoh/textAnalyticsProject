In the A-League\u2019s short fifteen-year history, only once has the reigning premiers been bottom after eight rounds \u2013 there\u2019s a residual bonhomie in the dressing room, or conversely a fear-factor in opponents, that sees the top team start the follow-up campaign brightly. With just six points separating third from eleventh, it\u2019s too early to be hitting the panic button over in the west. But it\u2019s clear that the elixir of factors that combined to deliver Perth its first silverware has drastically dissipated. Mostly keenly felt is the absence of key premiership personnel. In a league of few high quality fullbacks Jason Davidson\u2019s consistently dangerous final-third delivery is sorely missed \u2013 only one fullback provided more assists last campaign. In a defensive line spoilt for leaders in 2018/19 nobody has come close to replacing Shane Lowry \u2013 for heart, for tenacity, for sheer dominance. And a 10+ goal striker in four of his five seasons with Glory, Andy Keogh remains a massive out, not just for his goals but his industry and general nuisance factor that enabled Diego Castro a freer role and fewer defensive responsibilities. Glory have also shifted from hunters to hunted. So successful in transition last year, Perth were able to absorb pressure before striking quickly through the pace of Joel Chianese and Chris Ikonomidis. Whereas defence was the priority (as is customary in a Popovic first-season side) the former Wanderers boss has looked this season for his side to dictate play more. It has yielded positives in terms of possession and passes made \u2013 against a Victory side at home it was Glory who boasted nearly two-thirds of the ball and made almost two passes for every one of their opponents \u2013 but it\u2019s left them susceptible to teams looking to hit them as they once did others. It\u2019s no surprise that facing packed defences both Chianese and Ikonomidis have had significantly less successful seasons thus far; the challenge for Popovic and his staff will be to adjust. Ominously for Perth, of the six sides immediately above them, they\u2019ve only managed to beat Wellington. A loss to the Mariners and points dropped to Brisbane and Newcastle are not the stuff of premierships. But at this early stage of the season it\u2019s still a question of glass-half-full or glass-half-empty in assessing Glory\u2019s campaign. From one angle, they\u2019re a fortuitous 86th minute Castro goalmouth scramble away from four straight losses, from the other they\u2019re an unlucky 50th minute apex-of-post-and-crossbar effort from Bruno Fornaroli away from a possible top six place. A key factor in campaigns that go rapidly south is dressing room morale, and there are few better potential hand grenades then having two of your sons in the squad \u2013 just ask Alistair Edwards. Irrespective of their obvious talent, it\u2019s an easy sore point for those left out. While results are there the grievance abates, but when the points stop, the fester circulates. To the relief of Perth fans, there doesn\u2019t appear to be on-field rot, yet. With six of their seven goals so far coming in the final fifteen minutes of halves, Glory\u2019s mental and physical application remains high. But there\u2019s a general caution and a lack of cutting edge at times that suggests unease. With a dressing room full of \u201cbig characters\u201d the next few results could tip this either way. Drilling into the data, the portents look bright for Perth. Glory have executed the most successful final-third passes, faced the fewest shots, scored 100% their goals from inside the box, and conversely, lead the league for fewest goals conceded from inside the box. These are not the statistics of the A-League\u2019s 11th best team. In plain language: their defence doesn\u2019t offer many chances, but their attack creates plenty. The issue then is execution \u2013 and with opponents proving ruthless and Perth so far toothless, the side have squandered a dominance hard-earned in midfield. There\u2019s a case to thank the spectre of Warren Joyce for this \u2013 a pre-Joyce Fornaroli could have 5-8 goals to his name already. And while Jamie Maclaren is playing like a player set free, the Uruguayan is playing like a man that had a year in the wilderness. With City Perth\u2019s next opponents, what chance a Galeano-esque release of goals from Bruno? It could make his FA Cup winning speech look tame in comparison. Perth are not shy of winners in their squad, and being bottom will smart keenly. Unless there are significant unaired issues, a reaction is coming \u2013 an ominous prospect for City, Wanderers and Jets \u2013 Perth\u2019s next opponents. If their marquee man can find the form that saw him the fastest to 50 goals in the A-League\u2019s history, Glory\u2019s campaign could kickstart, and in spectacular fashion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
