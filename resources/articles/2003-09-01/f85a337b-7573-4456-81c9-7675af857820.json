Now the question is: have his players done the same? Saturday night, Sunday morning and all day Monday were spent in introspective dissection, but Hughes emerged from that mood yesterday morning. Standing in the foyer of the team hotel on the outskirts of Cardiff, he declared: \"We still feel we've got a chance to win the group.\" With that short sentence the gloom was expelled. Hughes expects, and his Wales team must live up to that expectation in front of 70,000 at the Millennium Stadium against Finland tonight. \"We just need to reassert ourselves,\" he added, \"and understand that we're still a good side.\" That side had been dented severely by Italy and this is a test of Hughes's management. A Wales victory, coupled with an Italy draw in Belgrade against Serbia-Montenegro, would put the Welsh back on top of the group. That is the best-case scenario, the one that would leave Wales needing to beat the Serbs in Cardiff next month to clinch the group. More likely, however, is that Italy will win in Belgrade, and that would mean Wales will need only a point this evening to ensure a play-off place. \"We aim to put Saturday right,\" Hughes said. \"We all have higher standards than we had. Possibly in the past we would have accepted that because we were playing Italy away; I don't think we have to accept that now. We have raised our standards. \"We were just a little bit down on our standards last week. But I've been pleased by how the players have shown themselves on the training pitch. They don't look like they are feeling sorry for themselves, which is important. You can't dwell on it, you have got to get on with it.\" The difficulty Wales face is a disintegrating squad. Mark Delaney, Robbie Savage and Craig Bellamy all collected suspensions in Milan. Mark Pembridge suffered a foot injury, and the centre of defence is of no less concern than it was in San Siro. Robert Page should be fit but who will partner the Sheffield United player is uncertain. Andy Melville, Kit Symons and Danny Gabbidon are all carrying injuries and Adrian Williams of Reading is again favourite to start. Hughes left Williams on the bench in Italy and may again shuffle his players. One plus point for the Wales manager, though, is that Jari Litmanen, Finland's former Liverpool forward, has an achilles tendon problem and has not travelled to Cardiff. But Mikael Forssell, Sami Hyypia and Antti Niemi offer Premiership experience and will threaten Welsh nerve. The Finns also have an outside chance of pipping Wales to the play-offs. But Niemi put that into perspective: \"It would take something special. We have to be realistic. Wales have surprised quite a few people around the world.\" Wales (4-5-1, possible): Jones (Southampton); Oster (Sunderland), Page (Sheffield United), Williams (Reading), Speed (Newcastle United); Davies (Tottenham), Earnshaw (Cardiff), Pembridge (Fulham), Koumas (WBA), Giggs (Manchester United); Hartson (Celtic). Finland (4-4-2, possible): Niemi; Reini, Tihinen, Hyypia, Saarinen; Nurmela, Vayrynen, Tainio, Kopteff; Kolkka, Forssell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
