As Donizetti's tomboy Marie, she had just ironed a pile of laundry, peeled buckets of potatoes and muttered earthy curses while firing off a succession of high Cs and astronomical E flats. During one aria she agreed to be lofted above the heads of the male chorus like a rock chick in a mosh pit. She was - as you can see when the production is televised on BBC4 on 30 December - quite maniacally funny: imagine a female Jim Carrey with a freakish talent for coloratura. In September, as the mad murderess Lucia at the Met, she made the mental implosion of a victimised woman more heartbreakingly real than it has ever been before. The director rewarded her with an additional silent scene: at the end she returned posthumously as a vampiric ghost, and gave the melodiously expiring tenor a cold kiss of death. The performance, relayed to the Nasdaq screens above Times Square on the first night of the Met's season, literally stopped traffic. Whether in knockabout comedy or demented tragedy, Dessay's intensity is reckless. Both vocally and dramatically, she risks herself; she epitomises the danger that gives a scary edge to the greatest theatrical performances. 'That's the game,' she said to me when we met recently in Paris. 'Maybe it is self-destructive, but I am paid for that. My dream is to be on a trapeze and to throw myself through the air while I sing those high notes!' If it ever happens, you can be sure there will be no safety net. In a production of Lucia in Lyons she fell out of her bloodstained nightdress during the heroine's mad scene; she was so busy acting that she didn't notice. The first of Dessay's two forthcoming Barbican gigs, a baroque concert tomorrow, will be relatively sober. Among her tasks, in Bach's Magnificat, is to rejoice in the immaculate conception. She enjoys the discipline of performing such pieces with the conductor Emmanuelle Haim, though she is not one of nature's seraphs. 'I may have the voice of an angel,' she told me, 'but I am a witch!' I can testify that there is also a tart strain of bitchiness in Dessay's nature, evinced in her scornful comments on colleagues - a famous tenor who can't act, an acclaimed director who fusses over concepts and forgets about the characters on stage. She shrugged when I wondered whether these acid asides should be on the record. 'I am brutal,' she said, and made a scything motion with her hand like the thud of the executioner's axe. 'There is violence in me, though I now know how to control it. Mostly it only comes out on stage. I wish there was more of it in the music I sing - I could be a killer like Tosca, or set fire to the world like Brunhilde in Gotterdammerung, but I don't have the voice for those parts. If only I could sing Puccini!' She compensated with a guttural, agonised rendition of the aria sung by his Manon Lescaut as she croaks in the desert. The spirit is certainly willing; the vocal cords, however, can hardly take the strain. Maria Callas is Dessay's heroine, but also a cautionary instance of what happens when a light, fragile voice is asked to do more visceral work. She intends to console herself by singing Musetta in La Boheme. Remembering the character's zany antics, I remarked that Dessay would probably be good in the part. 'I think so too,' she said with implacable self-possession. Her later Barbican concert on 26 January will be an anthology of scenes from Italian opera, culminating in the effervescently hedonistic aria of the courtesan Violetta in La Traviata. The role is at the top of Dessay's wish list, and she will perform it at Santa Fe in New Mexico in a couple of years' time. 'I have my problems with Violetta. When her boyfriend's father pleads with her to give him up, why doesn't she just say \"fuck you\"?' Dessay, carefully prioritising, describes herself as an actress who sings. She discovered her voice by accident while performing a scene from a Moliere play in an acting class at the age of 20; at this stage in her career she is ready to contemplate dispensing with a voice that, as she complains, does not really match her character. She will soon sing the heroine of Debussy's Pelleas et Melisande - or rather, as she explained, she won't sing it. 'Melisande doesn't sing, not in the operatic sense. She speaks, she whispers, she never emotes.' The ultimate challenge will come in 2010, when Dessay appears in Paris in a non-musical play written for her by Thomas Bernhard. 'It is about an opera singer who has performed the Queen of the Night 500 times, poor thing: that's many, many more than I did. She is sick of it all but still she is the prisoner of her profession. It's set in her dressing room, where she confides in her father and her doctor. For this I will have no orchestra to help me. When there is just a spoken text, you must compose your own music as you go along. So at long last I will have the chance to be a real actress!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
