The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Fast Retailing, which owns the Uniqlo apparel chain, has approached J Crew\u2019s management about potentially buying the private-equity-owned business. J Crew, chaired by the retail guru Mickey Drexler, is seeking upwards of $5bn for the business, according to the Journal. The companies were not immediately available for comment. The US fashion chain has had a renaissance under Drexler, a former chief executive of Gap. Drexler joined the company in 2002 after he was fired by the founder of Gap, Donald Fisher. Michelle and Malia Obama wore J Crew to President Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration. Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, have also been spotted wearing the brand. J Crew started in 1983, as a catalog business. Drexler steered it upmarket and designers Jenna Lyons and Frank Muytens are now among the most influential in retailing. The company regularly partners with brands including Barbour and Alden Shoes and it has been looking at international expansion in Canada and Japan. A flagship store opened in London in November. Uniqlo has been challenging Gap to offer stylish and affordable basics. The company is in the midst of an aggressive expansion and has stated it aims to have $10bn in sales in the US by 2020. Its parent company, Fast Retailing, employs more than 23,000 people and owns brands including Helmut Lang, Theory and Princesse Tam Tam. The talks come as J Crew\u2019s owners, the private-equity firms TPG and Leonard Green &amp; Partners, are reportedly considering taking the apparel chain public later this year. They have also reportedly held talks with other retailers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
