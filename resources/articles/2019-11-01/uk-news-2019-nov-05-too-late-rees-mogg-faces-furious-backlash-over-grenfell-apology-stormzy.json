The rapper Stormzy joined relatives, including the nephew of a Grenfell Tower victim who died after being told to stay put by the London fire brigade, in angrily dismissing the cabinet minister\u2019s statement that victims should have left the burning tower block. The leader of the House of Commons issued \u201ca profound apology\u201d after he told a radio interviewer: \u201cI think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do.\u201d Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle Hesham Rehman, 57, died in the fire, said Rees-Mogg was an \u201cidiot\u201d whose remarks revealed the detachment of the government from the Grenfell community. \u201cThe apology is too late,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cSorry means nothing. It\u2019s such an easy word to say. Your action means something but we have had words and no action.\u201d The Justice 4 Grenfell group described Rees-Mogg\u2019s original comments as \u201cappalling\u201d and Jeremy Corbyn called them \u201ccrass\u201d and \u201cinsensitive\u201d. \u201cWhat possesses someone to react to an entirely avoidable tragedy like Grenfell by saying the victims lacked common sense?\u201d the Labour leader tweeted. Stormzy, who has been a long-term supporter of the Grenfell survivors and spoke out against Theresa May\u2019s response to the disaster, called on Rees-Mogg to resign, tweeting: \u201cThese politicians are actual aliens.\u201d \u201cBare [so many] of you politicians are evil and wicked and this is why we hate you,\u201d he said. \u201c72 people died in a tragedy that you are to blame for \u2026 This ain\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about the people who govern us lacking the most basic humanity or empathy. It\u2019s nuts to me.\u201d Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) general secretary, said it was \u201ccallously irresponsible\u201d for a senior government figure to suggest the public should ignore firefighters when they are in a fire. The outpouring of anger at Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments came amid a difficult day for the Conservative party on the eve of their election campaign launch. Earlier, it was revealed that the Treasury would not conduct a costing of Labour\u2019s economics plans, as the government wished, because it breached civil service impartiality rules. Fellow Tory Andrew Bridgen later compounded the anger during an exchange with the BBC Radio 4 PM presenter, Evan Davis, in which he appeared to suggest Rees-Mogg was \u201ccleverer\u201d than those who died. Asked whether Rees-Mogg meant to say he would have left the flats that night against official advice, Bridgen said: \u201cThat\u2019s what he meant to say.\u201d Davis responded: \u201cBut in a way that is exactly what people object to, which is he is, in effect, saying: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice.\u2019\u201d Following a long pause, Bridgen said: \u201cBut we want very clever people running the country, don\u2019t we Evan? That\u2019s a byproduct of what Jacob is and that\u2019s why he is in a position of authority.\u201d The outrage was further intensified when it emerged that the government had placed the building firm that oversaw the disastrous refurbishment of Grenfell on an official list of companies recommended to public sector bodies seeking contractors for high-rise housing in the south of England. That decision added \u201cinsult to injury\u201d, according to Grenfell United, the bereaved and survivors\u2019 group, and shocked many in the community less than a week after the chairman of the public inquiry into the disaster concluded the London fire brigade\u2019s planning was \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d and that the building works broke building regulations. \u201cIt makes me so angry,\u201d Mussilhy said. \u201cThe detachment from the politicians in this government is still alive. This tragedy was supposed to shake and awake this nation. Two-and-a-half years on, these types of comments from a cabinet minister should not exist. \u201cPeople like my uncle couldn\u2019t leave the tower even if they wanted to and [he] was told on several occasions firefighters were coming to get him. He took comfort in that. Did he not use his common sense? \u201cThey are still detached. They are still clueless.\u201d Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who is leading the Grenfell inquiry, said more lives could have been saved if the London fire brigade dropped its \u201cstay put\u201d policy sooner as staff tried to tackle the blaze. Many remained in their flats for several hours as the fire tore through the building and were trapped by heat and smoke. It emerged that 55 of the 72 people who died in the fire were told to remain in their homes. In his apology, Rees-Mogg said: \u201cWhat I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade\u2019s advice to stay and wait at the time. However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn\u2019t and I don\u2019t think anyone else would. \u201cI would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments. With hindsight and after reading the report, no one would follow that advice. That\u2019s the great tragedy.\u201d The fire, on 14 June 2017 in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was the biggest single loss of life in London since the second world war. The shadow secretary of state for housing, John Healey, said Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion was shocking. \u201cThey were told to stay where they were by the fire service, who were acting on national guidelines.\u201d The Lib Dem candidate for Kensington and Chelsea, Sam Gyimah, said the comments were insensitive and disgraceful. The victims of Grenfell included six members of the same family, the Choucairs, and five members of the Hashim family, who all lived on the 22nd floor. At least 18 children were killed in the disaster. Among them were a six-month-old baby, Leena Belkadi, and Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
