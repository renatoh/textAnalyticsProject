No such doubts about the franchise itself - this formula has officially flat-lined. Still, here comes Nielsen, his one-liners more dead than pan these days as as he groggily goes through the motions as the lecherous uncle of a nerdy crime fighter (Drake Bell). Oh please God, let it end. Every scene is like witnessing a tiny murder in which an enfeebled gag is wheeled out, tortured for a spell and then mercifully laid to rest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
