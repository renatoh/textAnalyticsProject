Dozens of staff members are still refusing to return to work a week after Roland Rudd, the campaign\u2019s chairman, fired two senior figures and instigated a structural overhaul in what has been seen as a power grab. There are now accusations of locks being changed and staff claim they feel intimidated, with the split showing no sign of being resolved. Opponents of Rudd\u2019s overhaul said it had disabled the campaign just at the moment when anti-Brexit voters needed guidance on the best candidate to back to deliver a parliamentary majority for a second referendum. They claim the People\u2019s Vote recommendations would have differed in many seats when compared with the main tactical voting site currently operating, run by the Best for Britain campaign. They state that there were about 30 seats where the People\u2019s Vote was planning to back Labour candidates, but where the Best for Britain site is backing the Lib Dems, and nine where it was expecting to back Labour candidates, in which the Best for Britain site advises voters to vote for anyone. There were more than 60 seats where the People\u2019s Vote model was waiting for further polling evidence before making a recommendation, where Best for Britain is backing the Lib Dems. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief and a People\u2019s Vote supporter, said: \u201cThe team was taken off the pitch ahead of one of the most important weeks in this whole process. The campaign had a number of major initiatives planned for last week, including a tactical voting operation that was likely to become the gold standard in terms of analytics and also the reach into the debate.\u201d Naomi Smith, Best for Britain\u2019s chief executive, defended her campaign\u2019s findings: \u201cOur data is from October and uses the technique which predicted Trump\u2019s election, the hung parliament in 2017, and came within 0.6 percentage points of the exact result in Peterborough when other pollsters were caught cold. We plan to keep updating this based on the latest and best data. \u201cWe have carefully stayed away from the ugly meltdown of People\u2019s Vote. This attempt to drag us into their nasty little civil war does nothing but undermine the movement .\u201d Labour leaped on the claims that more of the party\u2019s candidates should be backed. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \u201cThis election, there will be a big tactical vote for Labour by those who want to stop Boris Johnson forcing his hard Brexit and a new era of austerity on our country. Liberal Democrat boasts that they can win hundreds of seats are not supported by the independent analysis done by the People\u2019s Vote campaign.\u201d People\u2019s Vote staff walked out after Rudd fired chief executive James McGrory, a former adviser to Nick Clegg, and Tom Baldwin, its director of communications who worked for Labour under Ed Miliband. The move took place after he had restructured the campaign around a new company. Baldwin said: \u201cWe don\u2019t dispute the accuracy of the Best for Britain poll, but believe using a number of different pieces of data, including previous election results and local factors, is a better way to make accurate and independent assessments.\u201d However, a People\u2019s Vote source insisted that the tactical voting exercise would still take place closer to the election and that the recommendations were changing as new data emerged. \u201cThis election is the most important in a generation and tactical voting needs to be a central part of it. We are committed to giving our supporters the very best non-partisan advice,\u201d said the source. At the heart of the row are allegations that Rudd wants to support a realignment of politics around a pro-Remain political force, rather than concentrate on winning a second referendum. This is denied by Rudd\u2019s camp, who say the restructuring was designed to ensure the campaign was in the best possible shape. It comes after another week of acrimony. Scores of staff have now signed a letter to Rudd saying they do not want to return under the current management and alleging a \u201cconcerted campaign to intimidate, isolate and victimise staff\u201d. The letter states: \u201cThe staff\u2019s priority is to safely return to our workplace without further delay so that we can continue the campaign. Staff have been unable to get into the office as locks have been changed without prior notification or explanation.\u201d A source close to Rudd said: \u201cNothing prevents staff from returning to work, indeed they have been encouraged to return to work with the 20 or so that already have. Thirty remain on strike and new staff are being hired. Roland owns all the data, has paid all the staff and his decision will not be reversed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
