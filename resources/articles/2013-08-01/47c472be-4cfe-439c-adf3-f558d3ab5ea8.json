Universities need to think creatively about language provision in their institutions. At Regent's University London, although instruction in 10 languages is available to all, more than a third of our students must study a new foreign language interlaced in the subject material of their degree programmes. These students also spend two semesters studying or working in a country relevant to their language choice. Such immersion allows students to absorb new cultures and hone their language skills. The few weeks' study abroad offered by some universities are just a nod towards internationalism and are inadequate in preparation for work in a global environment. The sector needs to look beyond traditional language departments and consider establishing language institutes, which can provide tuition to students across all degree courses. Unless we tackle this urgently, our graduates will find it increasingly tough to compete with their multi-lingual counterparts overseas. Professor Aldwyn Cooper Vice chancellor and chief executive Regent's University London The excessive emphasis on research and research income in recent years has led university managers to place academics under even more pressure. Many departments that suffer no lack of students and are well rated by them are simply deemed to be deficient in \"research excellence\" and are therefore \"expendable\". Universities are not in the least bothered that language provision could simply disappear in their area \u2013 maximising profit is the only concern. Senior academics from research-excellent institutions could show a little more solidarity and sensitivity and not be quite so keen to collaborate with university managers in their quest to restructure language departments into oblivion. It's not just the Ukip-voting public and teenagers choosing not to study languages who are causing this crisis: universities are doing a pretty good job of fuelling it, too, and no one should be offering to help them. Dr Joy Charnley Glasgow The news that 40% of university language departments could close within a decade risks leaving us culturally marooned and linguistically lonely. British Council research has looked at topics ranging from the languages UK employers say we need to stay competitive, to how Britons' holiday habits betray a lack of language confidence and competence. The results send a clear message: English alone is not enough for our pleasure, leisure or business. Foreign-language skills aren't just about making ourselves understood. They are the key to unlocking and understanding other cultures. English is a global language, but we'll miss a world of opportunity if it is all we speak. John Worne Director of strategy, British Council London SW1 Having read with concern your front-page story last week, I was relieved to read in David Willetts's Comment article (\"In the race for scientific prowess we mustn't leave the arts behind\") that \"thanks to the Ebacc, language learning at GCSE is now at its highest level for nine years. We must now wait for this to filter through to universities. And that is why the Higher Education Funding Council for England is working with institutions on safeguarding modern language provision across the country\". Sounds as if it had better get a move on or there won't be any university language departments for linguistically able school leavers to take their degrees in and train to be the language teachers, translators and interpreters of the future.
