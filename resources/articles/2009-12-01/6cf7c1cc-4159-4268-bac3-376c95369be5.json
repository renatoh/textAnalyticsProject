This happened in England in the 1970s, and now Norway, formerly a chess backwater, is experiencing a boom due to Magnus Carlsen's exploits. The Norwegian government has just announced that it will give $12m (\u00a37.5m) backing to the Arctic town Tromso to stage the 2014 world team Olympiad. Carlsen's first prize in the London Classic was matched in the open event by his countryman, Jon Ludvig Hammer, also a 19-year-old, who led all the way from a strong field. And England's No 2 woman Jovanka Houska, whose tied second was a career-best result, now lives in Norway. The game below which settled first prize showed how dangerous it is for Black to defend passively against the 4 g3 Catalan. The position after 13 Qxe4 is known from several previous games and White has a large plus. The key to Hammer's fast win was moves 16-18 where he seized dark square control, leading to a rapid mating attack where Black resigned due to the imminent Rxh5+.
