The NT\u2019s paperless arrest law, which the coroner has warned will increase the number of Indigenous deaths in custody, was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and a breach of the constitutional separation of powers, the full bench of the court heard on Tuesday. The scheme introduced in December permits people to be jailed for up to four hours \u2013 and longer if drunk \u2013 if police suspect they have committed a summary offence, including making undue noise or failing to keep a front yard clean. Lawyers for the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (Naaja) said in a submission the law was \u201cunprecedented in Australia and in the common law world\u201d and \u201can impermissible intrusion by the legislature upon the institutional integrity of the NT courts\u201d. \u201cHow can it be reasonable to arrest and hold a person for up to four hours in order to decide whether, for example, to issue them with an infringement notice for $49, or charge them with an offence carrying a maximum penalty of a fine but no jail time?,\u201d they said. They were supported by the Human Rights Law Centre and the Australian Human Rights Commission, which said the law had seen people jailed without judicial oversight for crimes that themselves carried no jail term. Last month the NT coroner called for the police powers to be scrapped after the death of a 59-year-old Indigenous man in May. \u201cKumanjayi Langdon, a sick middle-aged Aboriginal man, was treated like a criminal and incarcerated like a criminal; he died in a police cell which was built to house criminals,\u201d the NT coroner, Greg Cavanagh, wrote. \u201cHe died in his sleep with strangers in this cold and concrete cell. He died of natural causes and was always likely to die suddenly due to chronic and serious heart disease, but he was entitled to die in peace, in the comfort of family and friends. In my view, he was entitled to die as a free man.\u201d The Walpiri man from Yuendemu was detained after police saw him drinking from a plastic bottle in a Darwin park. The offence normally carries a $74 fine. The inquest into his death heard anecdotal evidence that about 95% of those detained under the scheme have been Indigenous, an imbalance the coroner described as \u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d. More than 700 paperless arrests were made in the first three months of 2015. John Elferink, the NT attorney general, has defended the laws, arguing they cut down police paperwork and let officers spend more time on the streets, \u201crather than sitting in front of computer screens typing out long-winded arrest files, which effectively aren\u2019t necessary\u201d. He told Guardian Australia in August critics needed to \u201cstop making excuses\u201d for those who \u201cengage in self-destructive behaviour year in and year out\u201d. The attorney general also dismissed concerns that more Indigenous people would die behind bars, arguing the warnings suggested the police should \u201ctake nobody into custody\u201d. \u201cOK, nobody dies in custody, but the question I have in response then is: is it better that they die in a gutter?\u201d he said. The case is likely to clarify the limits of police powers of detention, and in addition to the NT, submissions have also been lodged by the Western Australian, South Australian, Queensland and New South Wales governments. Arguments will be heard until Wednesday afternoon, with a decision expected before the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
