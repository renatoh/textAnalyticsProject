But if they wish rather to understand how the capital's underground system - the most advanced in the world in the interwar years - came to be today's contemporary hotchpotch of 19th century tunnels, 1930s stations, 1960s trains and 1970s escalators, they could do worse than to read Christian Wolmar's new book Down the Tube. It's certainly better than ploughing through the 130 volumes of PPP contracts yourself - unless you are one of the City lawyers on \u00a3250 an hour, whose bills have thus far cost the taxpayer \u00a3400m. For Wolmar not only knows his PPP from his PFI from his PSBR from his DETR from his DTR from his DTLR from his JLE from his CTRL (all helpfully annotated in the book's glossary) but also writes a skilful political thriller, turning mundane contractual rows and departmental infighting into a gripping page-turner. This is emphatically not a book aimed at anoraks and trainspotters. In fact, we learn that the fairy godfather of the PPP is in fact former Conservative chancellor Norman Lamont, who devised the off-balance-sheet scheme during his ill-fated reign at No 11. However, it was only Kenneth Clarke, his successor, who started putting the Enron-style concept (PFIs don't appear on the public sector borrowing requirement) into practice. Low cunning became high farce as the dead-on-its-feet Major government inserted a last-minute clause in its 1997 manifesto to privatise the tube. Labour's then transport secretary, Clare Short, responded with the weasle-worded declaration that Labour would oppose the \"wholesale\" privatisation of London Underground. And of course with a public-private partnership (in true Orwellian fashion, Labour realised this terminology played better with the public than a \"private finance initiative\") the scene was set for Labour's first big sell-off and the political rebirth of a certain \"Red Ken\". Because, of course, if Mr Lamont is the father of the PPP, Mr Livingstone is both its bastard offspring and its beneficiary, becoming the first mayor of the capital on a platform of opposing the sale. In theory, the tube lines were expected to be split up and flogged off long before he regained control of London in May 2000. In fact, the first contract - to sell the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines - was only signed on New Year's Eve with the news buried in true Jo Moore style. Just another minor adjunct to the skullduggery and spinning which the author unveils in a surprisingly pacy 225 pages. At least with Ken you feel here is a politician who cares about transport (the tube court cases, the appointment of Bob Kiley, the congestion charge, the bus expansion, the lack of a mayoral car and chauffeur) which is more than can be said of New Labour, with its four transport secretaries in six years (John Prescott, Lord MacDonald, Stephen Byers and now Alistair Darling), and its 10-year transport plan now in its second overhaul. Indeed, perhaps only in Britain could a 10-year transport plan be hailed, with a straight face, as long-term. Among the book's scoops is the revelation that Tony Blair, fearing that the PPP could finally blow up in Labour's face in the 2001 election, secretly summoned Mr Kiley to Chequers that Easter for the first in a series of four meetings that not even his boss, the mayor, was allowed to know about. Mr Wolmar also casts the first \"revisionist\" slant on Mr Byers, the \u00fcber-Blairite who ironically found himself the hero of old Labour for effectively renationalising Railtrack. Mr Byers is, like Blair, a lawyer who could see through the cracks of the PPP contracts and into the abyss below - however, when the prime minister appointed him as transport secretary it was on the condition that the PPP was non-negotiable. Wolmar ultimately casts Mr Blair as a PPP agnostic, while Mr Brown, the arch-villain of the book, is the PPP evangelist. It is the chancellor who still refuses to even meet Mr Kiley; who refused to appear before the transport select committee; who refused to answer questions on the PPP from the Treasury select committee; and who refused to answer questions from London Labour MPs on the tube. Unsurprisingly, Wolmar candidly admits that while only two people refused interview requests for the book, he didn't bother asking the iron chancellor. A useful tonic for those cowed New Labour cheerleaders still nursing the hope that a Brown administration would herald a red dawn. En route the author systematically destroys many of the cases for a part-privatisation, from the rigged public sector comparison figures, to the repeated claim by Mr Prescott and others that the public sector blew it with the over-running and over-budget Jubilee line extension - in fact, a positive success story compared with the privately-funded west coast mainline upgrade, now an incomprehensible \u00a310bn over-budget. With this and his last book on the catastrophic and lethal privatisation of British Rail, Wolmar has confirmed himself as the foremost expert on British public transport - forelorn, even Pyrrhic, post though that may be. \u00b7 Down the Tube - The Battle for London's Underground by Christian Wolmar is published by Aurum Press, \u00a39.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
