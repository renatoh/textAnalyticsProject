The PCB had invited Sri Lanka after India refused to travel there for a scheduled tour, a fall-out of the terror attacks in Mumbai last month. India were to play three Tests, five one-day matches and a Twenty20 international in a tour starting, with the first Test, in Karachi on 13 January. But yesterday Rajiv Shukla, the vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), confirmed a cancellation of the trip due to the \"current political scenario and atmosphere in the country\". Sri Lanka, currently in Bangladesh for two Tests and a triangular one-day series also involving Zimbabwe, will play three Tests, three one-dayers and a Twenty20 game in Pakistan. \"Sri Lanka have agreed to tour Pakistan,\" PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said. \"We are working on the dates and other details. \"Sri Lanka will travel to Pakistan straight from Bangladesh where their tour ends in the third week of January.\" According to the proposed itinerary, Sri Lanka are due to arrive in Karachi on January 19 and play the Twenty20 game and the first one-dayer there. They would then travel to Lahore where they would play two back-to-back one-dayers and the first Test. The second Test would be held in Multan and Sri Lanka would return to Karachi for the final Test before returning home. The PCB will now also hold a meeting to review the participation of Pakistani players in the two Twenty20 competitions in India. Several Pakistani players, including Younis Khan, Shoaib Akhtar, Sohail Tanvir and Shahid Afridi, play in the Indian Premier League while others such as the former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf have links with the unauthorised Indian Cricket League. \"This [players' participation in Indian leagues] is something we need to look at because of the existing relations between the two countries,\" added Altaf. \"We will make a few policy decisions on this soon.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
