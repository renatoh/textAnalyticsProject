On balance Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side deserved the victory, having turned their opponent\u2019s early ascendancy around, doing so convincingly following the break. A pleased Wolves manager said: \u201cIt was a good performance with some aspects to improve. We were better in the second half, but at the start it was very difficult for us.\u201d Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s verdict on the defeat was contradictory. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were better than us but they neutralised our game better,\u201d said Leeds\u2019 manager, the latter words summing up why Wolves took the points. Bielsa was forced to make a late change, with Pascal Struijk brought in for the captain, Liam Cooper, after the warm-up. The manager said he did not have any information as to how serious Cooper\u2019s problem was. In Leeds\u2019 early domination, H\u00e9lder Costa caused Wolves all kinds of problems along the right. A cross was headed firmly by Rodrigo and though misdirected, no visiting defender challenged the forward. Next a sweeping play that took in Jack Harrison, Patrick Bamford, and Rodrigo moved Leeds into Wolves\u2019 area, the latter teeing up Costa whose shot was wide. This prompted the maroon-shirted visitors to catch the mood in a sequence in which Nuno\u2019s men zipped the ball about until Maximilian Kilman attempted to emulate Rodrigo\u2019s defence-splitter but overhit badly. A further sign of Wolves evening the contest out had Neto racing down the right, Leeds being stretched precisely where they would not want. After a lull the contest reawakened: Luke Ayling\u2019s attempt skidded over the turf and was stabbed away by Kilman. Then, Neto \u2013 once more \u2013 forced the issue for Wolves and won them a rare corner, as like prizefighters the teams traded blows. Jo\u00e2o Moutinho pinged in from the right quadrant and the unmarked Jim\u00e9nez spurned a gilded chance to score. Patrick Bamford was soon guilty of the same charge: Harrison\u2019s ball found the No 9 with goal gaping but he missed. And, on half-time, Illan Meslier made a first save, beating out Daniel Podence\u2019s 10-yard shot. Leeds began the second half with Phillips continuing his chief orchestrator act, finding Harrison along the left, before a free-kick was claimed that the No 23 swung in. But this failed to threaten and Wolves responded. A Neves-Podence counterattack had Leeds back-pedalling and, a little later, Romain Sa\u00efss\u2019s strike beat Meslier before VAR chalked it off due to Podence being marginally offside before receiving along the right from Conor Coady. David Coote, the referee, was the VAR official who controversially missed Jordan Pickford\u2019s challenge on Virgil van Dijk in the weekend Everton-Liverpool draw that caused the latter a serious knee injury. Coote also ruled that Jordan Henderson\u2019s late strike was offside \u2013 again to some dispute. Here the technology came to Coote\u2019s aid. As Nuno said: \u201cThere was a proposal from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger [Fifa head of global development] for daylight for offsides, VAR is fine margins and we want them to make good decisions. It is a challenge for referees to improve, to be better, be faster and let the game flow.\u201d Podence\u2019s increasing influence had him forcing Meslier to make a second sharp save though the resulting corner was a disappointment \u2013 R\u00faben Neves\u2019s touch lacking poise. Wolves began to dominate as the half wore on. Neves scampered across Leeds\u2019 area and only a slip prevented him unloading a shot. Leeds had lost the rhythm that had bewitched Wolves before the interval. The previously incisive Phillips was reduced to hitting a dead ball sideways and when it came back the midfielder this time went backwards to Meslier. Still, the home side remained on terms. Required was a flash of inspiration, a moment to elevate one of the protagonists into a winning position. Instead Phillips\u2019s misfortune gave Wolves a lead they hung on to despite a late rally from Leeds who should feel that they allowed this match to slip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
