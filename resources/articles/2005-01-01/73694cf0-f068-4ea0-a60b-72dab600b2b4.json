AGAIN We waited. Then we waited some more. Then we waited some more, as our insides got ready to rumble like Ant and Dec circa 1994. But with even Granny Fiver's eye-of-a-needle Mulligatawny soup unable to cure our post-Christmas blockage, we spent all morning banished to Fiver Towers' outside toilet reading today's tabloids - and it was impossible not to notice that, after six weeks of desperately holding it all in, Jens 'Flapper' Lehmann had finally exploded with a stunning bout of verbal diarrhoea. We always suspected that, when he lost his Arsenal place to Manuel Almunia, Lehmann would go about as quietly as one of Dirk Diggler's female co-stars, but even we had to hold our nose once he got started. \"Of course I was surprised to be dropped. I'm sorry but what have I done wrong?\" he thundered, as the Fiver's back gave way under the weight of evidence. \"I was blamed for a lot of goals but in fact I never made a typical goalkeeping mistake,\" he continued, cunningly validating all those glory marches from his penalty area (and ignoring his Big Cup fumbling of a Claude Makelele shot that was travelling with all the velocity of a Fiver writer's brain). \"I've lost the ball outside the penalty area sometimes but that is down to my very risky game,\" Lehmann added, like this was a good thing. But Lehmann intends to stay at Arsenal, despite Arsene Wenger's suggestion that he might want to leave. \"It is the second time he has mentioned that and everybody knows why he does it,\" Lehmann said. \"I have signed for three years and I intend to honour that contract. If they can find someone who never ever makes the smallest mistake they should sign him right away. But it will be very hard to find that person.\" Petr Cech, anyone? ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY \"He is not in here as the Messiah. That does not rest on his shoulders\" - Norwich boss Nigel Worthington puts new signing Dean Ashton at ease. ********************* DOWN, DOWN DEEPER AND DOWN? The Fiver's editor is nothing if not a violent brute, but even he must feel like he's banging our heads against a brick wall for nothing when he sees the amount of clich\u00e9s we submit. Perhaps he should try other methods, such as those essayed today by Norwich, Crystal Palace and WBA, all of whom are determined to dispel the cliche that insists the three promoted clubs will go straight back down [that's not a clich\u00e9 (bang), it's a truism (cuff), you (whack) infuriating (biff) dunce (left jab, followed by right uppercut to the swingers) - Fiver ed]. Norwich, who today unveiled \u00a33m striker Dean Ashton, and West Brom have both splashed the cash [now that is (bang) a cliche - Fiver ed] to bring in new strikers. The Baggies clearly believe experience is the way to go, because as their capture of Argentine midfielder Matias Almeyda nears completion, they've brought in another tried and tested performer in the shape, and indeed the person, of Kevin Campbell. \"I honestly don't think the position Albion are in is that bad,\" said the former Everton captain, who obviously never reads the papers, or looks at websites, or listens to radio shows, or talks to people on planet earth. Meanwhile Palace, as befits a club who surged from 17th to sixth before clinching promotion last season, are attempting to reach safety via a particularly hazardous route. Not only is Iain Dowie under orders not to bring in any new blood, but he now has to resolve the riddle of what to do with Wayne Routledge, the jagged winger who today rejected an improved contract offer and could therefore leave for peanuts in the summer or for \u00a32m in January. \"I'll spend every day trying to get him to change his mind,\" wailed a desperate Dowie, who will surely be feted forever by the Northern Irish Guild of Druids if he conjures a way for the Eagles to land on their feet this time. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool's frankly tiresome attempts to sign Fernando Morientes have suffered another setback - Lyon, who can actually remember what it feels like to lift a trophy, are interested. Another day, another round of bartering from 'Arry Redknapp, who fancies knobbling Rupert Lowe for the \u00a32.5m it will cost him to bring in Jason Euell. Geremi is fed up of watching from the sidelines at Stamford Bridge and has loudly demanded a move to Middlesbrough. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Liverpool and Everton have come to the conclusion that a groundshare is not for them, a mere three years after the rest of us. Hearts won't be selling Tynecastle to developers after all. And Darren Anderton has been given a one-year extension to his Birmingham contract, which means he's bound to pick up an injury soon. * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Five: US Major League Soccerball - DC United v Kansas City Wizards (4.20am) Here are words we don't often hear: \"Nice one Fiver!\" Sky Sports 1: World Football Show (6.30pm &amp; 12am) It's drummer-hunter Stephen McNairn! \"I've had more responses than I got from placing an ad in the NME, so it looks as though you may have to get yourself a T-shirt featuring a dodgy metal band, a roll of gaffa tape and a surly backstage manner.\" Live Carling Cup Football: Liverpool v Watford (7pm) Right, back nicely patted, let's get down to the business of shifting your unwanted gear. British Eurosport: Live Efes Pils Cup (6pm) \"I already had a Best of Wet Wet Wet CD but somehow I seem to have acquired another,\" says Holf. \"Which means I have two Best of Wet Wet Wet CDs to get rid of. I wouldn't expect anything for them.\" BBC Radio 5: Sport on 5 (7pm) No? How about Dan Rook's offer? \"I have a natty-looking white Renault 5 for sale. She is an F-reg which, I think, makes her 46 years old, about 80,000 miles on the clock and starts first time, every time. Any takers? Believe me, anything the right side of derisory will be considered.\" Talksport: Kick off (7pm) And we leave you with a match made in heaven. Not Helen Tomkin and Ben S, mind. \"Imagine my surprise when reading that a 'James Sutton' had shown interest in drumming for a band advertised last week,\" says James Sutton. \"If I told you that I am bass player in a band currently looking for a drummer would you believe me? 'On bass James Sutton, on drums James Sutton'. We were destined to be together.\" Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Makes you feel all warm inside, doesn't it? Eh?
