In the 1980s. \u201cFor generations, we have assumed that the efforts of mankind would leave the fundamental equilibrium of the world\u2019s systems and atmosphere stable. \u201cBut it is possible that with all these enormous changes (population, agricultural, use of fossil fuels) concentrated into such a short period of time, we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself.\u201d The leader of the federal Greens, Richard Di Natale, celebrates his first anniversary as the party\u2019s leader on Friday. In an interview for the occasion, he referred to Thatcher\u2019s groundbreaking global warming speeches approvingly. \u201cShe was saying global warming\u2019s a huge problem, that we\u2019ve got to transition our economy,\u201d he said. By pushing hard for 90% renewable energy in Australia by 2030, the Greens were acknowledging that the world had failed to impose a price on the pollution Thatcher was so concerned about, he said. A Greens leader quoting Thatcher? \u201cWell, I\u2019m as much a Thatcherite as I am a Tory for supporting Senate voting reform,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] occasionally a broken clock gets it right every now and then.\u201d Under Di Natale\u2019s leadership, the Greens have been building a more pragmatic reputation in Canberra. He is not afraid to do things that could raise leftwing eyebrows \u2013 he is certainly more willing to negotiate with the Coalition. Asked to recall some of his achievements from the past 12 months, Di Natale listed some controversial ones \u2013 his support for Senate voting reform (passed), which some voters feared would make parliament less democratic; his support for laws on multinational tax avoidance (passed), after a deal struck with the Coalition; and the establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund, which also required a deal with the Coalition. But he made it clear it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d for the Greens to form government with the Coalition if the election produced a hung parliament. He wants the Greens to retain, at the very least, their 10 federal senators and one lower house MP in the election on 2 July. He has targeted the lower house seats of the Liberal MP Kelly O\u2019Dwyer in Melbourne and Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese in Sydney among possible gains for the Greens, with hopes of winning another eight seats over the next two elections. Di Natale said the Greens\u2019 membership had risen by a third in the past year, though the party did not release the numbers. On Sunday he will attend his first environmental protest since becoming leader. Organised by the climate action group 350.org under the banner Break Free from Fossil Fuels, protesters are planning to disrupt coal exports from Newcastle with a mass flotilla in the harbour. Di Natale, who will be there with his wife, Lucy, and their children said he felt very strongly about the danger posed by coal. \u201cHere we are at the start of an election campaign and no one\u2019s talking about one of the key issues, and that\u2019s dangerous global warming, and our contribution to it, through exporting of coal to the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that, a bit like marriage equality was something you couldn\u2019t talk about a decade ago and now it\u2019s a mainstream issue, in time we\u2019re going to say that continuing to open up new coalmines is just madness.\u201d He said the Greens\u2019 priority in the next parliament would be to renew Australia\u2019s energy system, to pass strong climate laws to protect the Great Barrier Reef and to protect Australia\u2019s forests. Policies already released include a five-year support package for 1.2m homes and 30,000 businesses, to encourage the take-up of solar storage. He said he was looking forward to debating the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, in Goulburn this month. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make the big polluters stop getting a free ride \u2026 We have to get back on track,\u201d he said in his Press Club speech last month. \u201cToo many years have been wasted.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
