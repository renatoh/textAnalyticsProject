The pressure is beginning to mount on Royle after one Premiership win in their last 13 games. But Bernstein insists Royle's future is not in doubt. \"I've made it clear from the beginning that stability and a long-term strategy are vital if this club is to progress,\" he told the Manchester Evening News. \"For a whole range of reasons Joe is the right man for us. The toughest decision is to do nothing because people perceive that as being weak, but it's very easy to have a knee-jerk reaction.\" Royle, meanwhile, is confident City can get out of trouble.

Sinclair is to see another specialist to determine whether he needs an operation. Meanwhile West Ham's defender Javier Margas has retired because of a persistent knee problem. The 31-year-old returns to Chile to concentrate on his hotel business, promising that \"any West Ham fans coming over can stay for free\". West Brom are poised to sign the midfielder Michael Appleton from Preston for \u00a3750,000, subject to a medical. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
