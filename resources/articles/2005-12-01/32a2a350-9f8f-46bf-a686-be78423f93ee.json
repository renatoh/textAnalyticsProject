Whereas \"nodding off\" may have been a problem for some governors in the past, \"nodding through\" seems to have become a much more contentious issue, after a hectic year of government-generated consultations, reviews and manifestos. A recent thread called Nodding Heads on the discussion board of the Department for Education and Skills' governornet website has prompted a stream of postings about rubber-stamping and the cavalier attitude of some governors. Over on the Times Educational Supplement's board, the controversial Review of the School Staffing Structure prompted postings from teachers who asked if governors really cared about what was going on, or were bothered enough to do anything about it. I received an email from a governor asking: \"If we volunteer to be a governor, then a certain level of interest can be assumed. If, in turn, we are interested in the outcome, then surely we need to be up-to-date, proactive, challenging and committed adults. So how do we encourage/persuade/force our colleagues to benefit from the wealth of experience and expert knowledge available?\" All the comments throw up some serious issues about commitment and the responsibility of every individual governor to ensure that they are suitably trained and briefed to tackle the challenges that they face. First of all, of course we care. We would not give up hours of precious time to sit in meetings if we did not want to make a difference. There is precious little kudos in being a governor these days. The second issue is time. To get your head round a particularly thorny issue, you have to make the time to do the research. Trawling through the internet may be one answer, but the DfES could make life a lot easier. The information available on governornet is sometimes patchy. More bite-sized, chronological briefings would be a help. If you don't have the time to find out all the background, at least make sure you have studied the agenda and any other paperwork that is distributed to you before a meeting. I must admit that I have attended the occasional meeting where I have not had time to read up what I should. It is pretty obvious to everyone else that you are trying to speed-read during \"matters arising\". Third, governors - particularly new ones - cannot assimilate all the information and background they might need immediately. If you are struggling, choose one area to mug up on first, the obvious one being whatever issue the committee you sit on deals with. Much information can be gained by talking to your colleagues. Don't wait for the meeting to question something on the agenda that you do not understand. Email or pick up the phone. Share your thoughts - we might all learn something. \u00b7 The governornet Nodding Heads thread can be read here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
