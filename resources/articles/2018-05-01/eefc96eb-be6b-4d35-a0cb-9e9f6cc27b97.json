A stripy-shirted arm reaches for it tentatively. \u201cHello?\u201d says a voice \u2013 deep, aristocratic, lugubrious and woozy, but unmistakably Benedict Cumberbatch (confirmed when the camera eventually looks higher). There is a delay and an echo on the line (remember that?). Sad news from New York: his father has died. Patrick Melrose, the character Cumberbatch is playing, sinks slowly towards the floor, but not in grief. He has dropped something; a syringe. There is a tell-tale blood spot on the shirt, too. After hanging up, Melrose\u2019s face slowly \u2013 very slowly \u2013 transforms. His eyes close, he exhales through his nose, the corners of his mouth twist into a smile, because heroin is now flooding his brain cells and because of another kind of release \u2013 from the abusive relationship and trauma that was instrumental in getting him mixed up with serious drugs in the first place. \u201cOld bastard\u2019s only gone and died,\u201d he says to one of the women in his life. He is thinking of giving up drugs, he tells another. Then he Concordes across the Atlantic, where he fails spectacularly to give up drugs (to heroin add amphetamines, quaaludes, valium and alcohol) and very nearly fails to pick up his father\u2019s ashes. He only just fails to kill himself, too. The first episode of Patrick Melrose (Sky Atlantic), adapted by One Day writer David Nicholls from the autobiographical novels of Edward St Aubyn, covers two days in 1982 in New York, with flashbacks to a miserable childhood that is explored \u2013 excruciatingly and poignantly \u2013 in future episodes. It could have been ghastly \u2013 messed-up, Tennyson-quoting toff throws money at people and takes a lot of drugs in 80s New York, because his messed-up toff daddy wasn\u2019t very nice to him. And how can the thoughtful wit and exploration \u2013 of the character and of addiction and privilege - of the books translate to the screen? It is a triumph, though. Nicholls must take some credit for managing to boil down five books into five hours of television without losing flavour. I have seen three, each of which has a distinct character that has a lot to do with where and when it is set, yet they nod to each other and belong together, like movements in a symphony. The dialogue (much of which is Melrose in conversation with himself) is sharp; this is tight, intelligent adaptation. Then there is Edward Berger\u2019s direction. Berger, who did Deutschland 83, does excellent New York 82 as well. There are so many glorious scenes in the first episode. At the funeral parlour on Madison (\u201conly the best or go without\u201d Melrose\u2019s father would have said), where Melrose goes into the wrong room, a Jewish wake, before finding the right one and unwrapping his father like a birthday present (\u201cIs it Dad? It is! It\u2019s just what I wanted, you shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d). A disastrous date with an ambitious New York socialite who doesn\u2019t want a quaalude or even a drink. Another drink with a woman who witnessed some of Patrick\u2019s tragic childhood. During this one, a quaalude hits and everything slows down, as if all the batteries have suddenly gone flat \u2013 Patrick\u2019s voice, the movement of the camera \u2026 until he does a line of speed in the loo. Suddenly, everything \u2013 jerky camera movement included \u2013 is on full charge again. It is an immersive experience: not just watching Melrose, but kind of being him as well. Which brings us to the man who has thrown himself into Melrose. There are other fine performances: Sebastian Maltz, haunting as young Patrick; Hugo Weaving as his monster father; Jennifer Jason Leigh as his wasted, spaced out, waste-of-space mother. But this is the Cumberbatch show and it has come to town. He had always wanted the part, he told the Radio Times, which might have been problematic, made it a vehicle for his talents and range: look at me acting, now shower me with awards. Maybe there is a bit of that going on. But it also means he has a deep understanding of the character. He hits just the right note: hilarious, but also tragic, irritating, exasperating. It is addiction personified, sympathetic without being celebratory or glamorised. So, do look at him \u2013 it is impossible not to \u2013 and shower him with awards. He is, and it is, brilliant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
