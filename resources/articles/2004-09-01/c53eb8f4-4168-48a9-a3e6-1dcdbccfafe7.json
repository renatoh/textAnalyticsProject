The firm said its 92 British stores will report a \"very substantial loss\" due to a restructuring of the ailing division. Analysts think the overall loss for the year will be around \u00a326m, following on from a larger loss last year. Executive chairman Leo McKee took on responsibility for running the firm in June when Bruce and Steven Cohen, both part of the family that controls the furniture firm, resigned. \"This is a business that has not been well run,\" said Mr McKee. \"I have to express things carefully ... it was very, very serious.\" The company has cut 400 jobs and ended the practice of some staff not working on Saturday and Sunday, the busiest days for the firm. It has cut its distribution centres from 11 to two. It has also completed the first stocktake in five years and sold a lot of slow-moving stock at clearance prices. Investment bank Seymour Pierce described the firm's statement as \"disastrous\". The share price slumped 10% to 65p. Mr McKee said hurricane Ivan has hit the firm because customers with credit insurance will claim. The firm is insured for property damage, he said. Its Jamaican stores have reopened and it has re-established a \"trading presence\" in Grenada. It had planned to sell off its Caribbean business late this year to help pay down its \u00a3280m debt, but this has now been put off until the first half of next year. Courts said that it is still working out the cost of the hurricane, but its estimate is that the region's profits will be hit by \u00a34m to \u00a37m. It also faces a tax bill of up to \u00a344m after losing a Customs case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
