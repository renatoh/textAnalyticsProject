Nats, which navigates the world's planes across UK airspace, made a profit of \u00a368.8m over the 12 months to the end of March, compared with \u00a32m in the previous year. In 2002, a year after the government sold off 51% of the business, Nats reported a loss of \u00a380m. As a result of the jump in profits the company will pay \u00a35m back to its shareholders with the government, holding 49%, taking the lion's share of the cash. Its 5,000 employees, however, will also get a small share of the dividend. Nats said the increase in profits came as a result of rising traffic with an increase in routes among low-cost airlines and a recovery in transatlantic flights. Flights to and from north America are now almost back to the levels seen before the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001. Overall Nats said it had seen traffic increase 5% during the year. Overall Nats saw revenues increase \u00a340m from the previous year to \u00a3639m. Nats has been dogged in the past by technical problems with its new \u00a3623m air traffic control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire which opened in 2002. The centre suffered problems with its software before it was opened and then services were affected by a shortage of staff. But Nats said yesterday that the centre is running properly and helped reduce delays to passengers' journeys caused by the air traffic control system. The average delay per flight caused by problems with air traffic control was 21 seconds, half the level recorded by Nats in the previous year and the lowest in the firm's history. \"By any measure, the past year has been our best on record both operationally and financially.\" said chairman Chris Gibson-Smith. The most recent problems at Nats have been caused by its older sites. Last June a computer breakdown at the network's West Drayton control centre grounded flights across Britain. The failure affected 200,000 travellers during the morning rush hour and caused a backlog which lasted for two days. The hitch was caused by a printer which was plugged into the system and which was not recognised by the centre's 20-year-old software after a maintenance shutdown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
