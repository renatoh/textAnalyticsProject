The green deal scheme was launched in January 2013 with the intention of handing out loans to improve domestic energy efficiency. It folded in July 2015 despite claims by David Cameron that his would be \u201cthe greenest government ever\u201d. The National Audit Office has examined the scheme for the first time and found that the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent \u00a3240m on the scheme. Another \u00a3154m has been spent on the green deal home improvement fund which was set up to provide subsidies for efficiency measures, auditors found. They said 1.4 million homes benefited from measures ranging from new boilers to insulation by the end of last year under government schemes, but just 1% of households took out \u201cgreen deal\u201d loans. Around 14,000 households opted for the loan scheme but the numbers fell far below expectations, the report said. Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the public accounts committee, said the report shows ministers and officials had little idea how to implement the scheme. \u201cThe Department of Energy and Climate Change has been flying blind when it comes to implementing the green deal and energy company obligation (ECO),\u201d she said. \u201cThe schemes have cost over \u00a33bn to date, but the department has achieved little energy savings compared to previous schemes,\u201d she said. Improving energy efficiency in the UK\u2019s 27 million homes, which are responsible for more than a quarter of the country\u2019s energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, is seen as key to tackling climate change, energy security and fuel poverty. Under the scheme, householders could avoid the upfront costs of insulation, efficient heating systems, draught proofing, double glazing and renewable energy generation such as solar panels, paying back the cost of their installation with savings on bills. But the loans were too expensive, the scheme was frequently changed and householders did not take up the finance plans at the expected rate, according to its critics. The scheme\u2019s failure to persuade households that energy efficiency measures were worth paying for meant it cost the taxpayer \u00a317,000 per loan plan, the report said. Auditors concluded the green deal did not achieve value for money and delivered \u201cnegligible\u201d carbon savings. The design of the ECO, which requires suppliers to install energy saving measures in homes to cut carbon emissions, was also examined by auditors. The \u00a33bn ECO scheme, whose costs are passed on to consumer bills, saved only around 30% of the carbon emissions of previous programmes, partly because of an initial focus on \u201charder to treat\u201d homes which cost more to make efficient. Taken together, the government\u2019s various energy efficiency schemes have cost \u00a394 for each tonne of carbon they saved, significantly more than the \u00a334 per tonne of carbon dioxide of the schemes they replaced. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: \u201cThe Department of Energy and Climate Change\u2019s ambitious aim to encourage households to pay for measures looked good on paper. \u201cBut in practice, its green deal design not only failed to deliver any meaningful benefit, it increased suppliers\u2019 costs \u2013 and therefore energy bills \u2013 in meeting their obligations through the ECO scheme. The department now needs to be more realistic about consumers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 motivations when designing schemes in future to ensure it achieves its aims.\u201d Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cThis damning report shows it isn\u2019t just the energy companies who are short-changing their customers, it\u2019s the Tories too. Investment in energy saving should be a national priority but these schemes are so badly designed they are ripping people off and failing to target those families who need help the most.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \u201cThe government is clear about the need to have firm financial controls in place to protect consumers, which is why we took action last July to address the issues in this report \u2013 stopping funding to the Green Deal Finance Company and setting up an independent review of the energy efficiency sector. \u201cWe are now designing a new scheme that will help make even more homes warmer and bring people\u2019s bills down.\u201d This article was amended on 14 April 2016.
