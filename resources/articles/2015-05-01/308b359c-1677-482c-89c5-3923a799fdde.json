In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman in September 2008, a number of governments bailed out their banks, including in the UK where Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland received a \u00a365bn capital injection. Paltalidis did not scrutinise the UK banking sector but found that a shock in sovereign debt markets across the eurozone would spread fastest around the system to cause losses for the banking industry. He said holdings of government bonds inside eurozone banks were now the biggest proportion of their assets since 2006. The report, co-authored by Dimitrios Gounopoulos, Renatas Kizys and Yiannis Koutelidakis, concludes: \u201cIt is evident from the results that the European banking system remains highly vulnerable and conducive to financial contagion implying that the new capital rules have not substantially reduced systemic risks, and hence, there is a need for additional policies in order to increase the resilience of the sector\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2015 to include the names of the co-authors of the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
