Meanwhile, Daniel Taylor tells us why the Dutch continue to be a bit dull and effective after Holland's 2-1 win over Slovakia (the team with far and away the worst haircuts on view). Plus, there's more on England's early but thoroughly deserved exit from South Africa, and finally, we look forward to the Spain-Portugal clash with Sid Lowe, and wonder who'll emerge victorious between Japan and Paraguay. Tweet us here, and we'll see you tomorrow: same Bat time, same Bat channel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
