EU citizens currently in the UK are expected to be protected under the terms of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement but findings by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) illustrate how proposals by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) will potentially restrict businesses recruiting migrants from the EU in future. In its report on EU migration after Brexit, published on Tuesday, the committee recommended lifting the cap on highly skilled workers applying to take up jobs in the UK but also backed maintaining the salary threshold of \u00a330,000. The committee also recommended only allowing in individuals at level three or above on the nine-level regulated qualifications framework (RQF). Comparing this criteria to data from the labour force survey, the IPPR estimates that around 75% of the UK\u2019s current EU workforce would not be eligible were they subject to the proposals. The findings will likely enflame concerns from business leaders over proposals they have already branded \u201cignorant and elitist\u201d. Marley Morris, IPPR\u2019s senior research fellow, said: \u201cThe new proposals from the migration advisory committee would have a dramatic impact on the UK\u2019s labour force and on employers. Our analysis suggests that a large majority of migrants from the EU employed in the UK would not meet the criteria proposed by the MAC. \u201cWhile of course EU citizens currently in the UK will be protected by the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, the MAC\u2019s recommendations would have significant implications for future EU migrants. Overall, these proposals would see a major shake-up for our immigration system, with sectors such as hospitality, logistics and wholesale feeling the squeeze.\u201d Morris said the IPPR would support a different approach to managing migration post-Brexit. \u201cRather than simply cutting off low-skilled EU labour, the government should consider ways to incentivise employers to pay more and train more, by offering advantages in the visa system to responsible businesses,\u201d he said. According to the analysis, the industries most likely to be negatively affected include hotels and restaurants, where an estimated 97% of EU employees would be ineligible; transport and storage, where an estimated 95% would be refused under new proposals; and wholesale and retail, where 92% would be ineligible. The least-affected industries include financial services, where only 25% of EU employees would be ineligible, and information and communications, where 30% would not meet the criteria in the proposals. The MAC report shut down a wide range of claims made about the impact of immigration in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. The experts found that the overall impact of migration from the European Economic Area was \u201csmall in magnitude when set against other changes\u201d, adding that \u201cmigrants have no or little impact\u201d on the employment or unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce, and that migration does not force down wages to \u201cany great extent\u201d. The advisers also found that the fall of the pound after the referendum, driven by uncertainty over the future of the UK economy, has had a larger impact on wages and employment opportunities than migration ever did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
