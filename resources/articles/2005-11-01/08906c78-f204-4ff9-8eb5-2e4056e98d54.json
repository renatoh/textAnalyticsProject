The next six weeks, said Burberry finance director Stacey Cartwright, are \"the biggest weeks of the year by far\" for the fashion brand and a range of pastel pink and baby blue duffel coats are set to be top sellers. \"Cold weather is always good for us,\" she said, \"and its turning nicely cold now.\" The coats, along with pink and blue knitwear and quilted jackets, are part of a mid season \"Flash\" collection that has just gone into the group's stores. Mr Cartwright said the Flash range and a new \u00a3795 Burberry Prorsum handbag, called Margaret, are flying off the shelves. Burberry was unveiling a 2% dip in first half profits to \u00a376m. The shares closed down 0.5p at 395p. Details of the profits decline came as the company announced the departure of its chief operating officer Brian Blake. Mr Blake's resignation comes a month after the company named Angela Ahrendts of US fashion group Liz Claiborne as successor to chief executive Rose-Marie Bravo. Mr Blake, who joined Burberry from Gucci two years ago, had been seen as a potential successor to Ms Bravo, but ruled himself out of the selection procedure for \"family reasons\". He will not receive a pay-off. Ms Ahrendts could be paid up to $31m over five years, with a salary of $1.3m a year and numerous bonus and incentive schemes. Her pay includes a clothing allowance of $25,000, $4m compensation for missing out on incentive schemes at Liz Claiborne and an annual \"overseas allowance\" of $610,000 for moving across the Atlantic. She will take charge in the summer, when Ms Bravo moves to a part time role overseeing strategy and marketing. Last month Burberry - which is 66% owned by the GUS retail and financial information group - announced a 3% increase in total revenues, to \u00a3355m, for the half year. However, pressure on prices has cut margins. The profits figure was slightly ahead of City expectations and one analyst described the result as \"solid\". However, broker Seymour Pierce cut its recommendation from hold to underperform on the grounds that some GUS shareholders - who are to be given Burberry shares as the fashion group is demerged from the larger group - will sell rather than remain as investors. The full details of the demerger are expected tomorrow with GUS's own half year results. Burberry has three sources of income - retail revenue, wholesale sales and licensing income from allowing others, such as fragrance manufacturers - to produce Burberry branded goods. Retail revenues were ahead 9% and licensing income up 3%, but wholesale sales were down 1% as buyers at department store outlets showed increased caution. Europe presented the biggest challenges, with softer demand in Spain - traditionally a robust market - and the UK, where trade has been hit by the high street gloom. Japan also produced a sales decline, as a result of weak market conditions and a deliberate programme of licence cancellations. Revenue from Asia, excluding Japan, was ahead 9%, with substantial demand from mainland China. In the key US market, strong retail sales growth was partially offset by a downturn in wholesale business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
