The Wales captain Gareth Thomas had an operation yesterday on the thumb he broke in five places against France on Saturday and will be out of action for two months, and the Ireland centre Shane Horgan is doubtful for next week's match against France in Dublin after injuring his thumb against England. Thomas has been replaced in the Wales squad by the Llanelli Scarlets centre Matthew Watkins and the captaincy is likely to go to the No8 Michael Owen. \"The selectors will talk about it but I would have thought Michael Owen would be our captain,\" said Wales's coach Mike Ruddock. \"He did a superb job in the second half against France.\" Horgan's injury will be diagnosed today. He was playing in the centre because of a hamstring injury to Gordon D'Arcy, who is expected to return against France, with Horgan moving back to the wing if fit. France's captain Fabien Pelous said yesterday he would almost certainly miss the tour to South Africa and Australia this year to rest and prepare for the 2007 World Cup. \"I'm going to miss the summer tour. It's almost certain,\" he told the French sports daily L'Equipe. \"I'm looking forward for the 2007 World Cup and it means that I will have to work hard to prepare myself. \"Last year I only had three weeks off. This time I want to prepare properly.\" The Toulouse player added that he felt exhausted after France's 24-18 defeat to Wales on Saturday. France will play South Africa twice in June before a Test in Australia on July 2 and the coach Bernard Laporte said Pelous had asked not to be considered. \"Pelous asked me to leave him out of the summer tour. I'm even considering giving him more rest and leaving him aside for the Test matches in the autumn.\" Pelous played his 99th international against Wales and should earn his 100th cap when France meet Ireland in Dublin on Saturday week. He would be the fifth player to reach the milestone, behind the Australians David Campese (101) and George Gregan (106), France's Philippe Sella (111) and England's Jason Leonard (114). The former New Zealand coach John Mitchell yesterday rejected the chance to take over from his compatriot Warren Gatland at Wasps when he signed a three-year contract to take charge of the new Super 14 team to be based in Perth. Leicester yesterday ruled out signing the rugby league international Andy Farrell, who looks bound for Saracens. The Tigers will lose their backs coach Pat Howard at the end of next season when his contract ends and he returns to Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
