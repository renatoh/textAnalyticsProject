More than a decade after the ceasefires, 94% of Northern Ireland's public housing remains segregated. Now, for the first time in its 35-year history, its public housing body, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, is creating purpose-built rented housing for families who want to live in mixed communities. The scheme, which officially opened this week, is a pilot for what will become a central plank of housing policy in the country under the government's Shared Future initiative. This is designed to reverse decades of social apartheid. Until now, people on the waiting list for social housing have had little choice but to opt to live on estates dominated by Catholics or Protestants. Here, territory is marked out by flags and aggressive murals, and out-siders feel - and often are - intimidated. As a result, shared social housing has been a long-standing demand of mixed-marriage couples, who can't live safely on estates of either complexion. Sharon, who doesn't want to give her surname, is a Protestant married to a Catholic. She vividly describes her family's experience on two Belfast estates. She says: \"First, we lived on a Protestant estate. My husband and I got bullets sent through the door, and we got letters threatening my husband's life if we didn't get out. We then tried to live on a Catholic estate and we had a lot of harassment. Gunmen came and took over our house, burnt out our car. It was constant intimidation.\" Sharon and her family are now stuck in private rented accommodation in Belfast. For Michelle Johnston, who has two children from a mixed marriage, a three-bedroom house on the new Enniskillen scheme offers a better future. She says: \"The children are very content, they play with the other children on the estate and there are no problems, no bother at all. Everyone wants it to work and we all talk away to each other no matter what religion we are. We all get on well. \"I want my children to grow up not with religion on their minds all the time. When you're in a mixed relationship you can't go to an estate that's all one side. You wouldn't want your kids to get bullied.\" Building mixed estates in Northern Ireland may look like a no-brainer. Yet that fails to take account of the fact that segregation itself has its roots in a desperate search for safety by thousands who fled mixed areas as the Troubles erupted. Between 1969 and 1973, Northern Ireland saw what was then one of the biggest forced movement of people in western Europe since the second world war. As houses were set alight by people who had once shared neighbourly relations, families fled to live among their own. Belfast's long-standing segregation became formalised as \"peacelines\" began to criss-cross the city. \"For many, many years, people have selected their housing on the basis of safety and security,\" says Paddy McIntyre, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. \"Nevertheless, with the ceasefires there is a climate now that does allow us to test out the type of management and policy issues around the development of shared housing.\" The Enniskillen scheme and future shared housing projects are not just for mixed marriage families. The housing executive may only allocate housing on the basis of need. Providing housing specifically for mixed couples, or using quotas to arrive at an even mix of religions, would constitute a breach of the rules. To overcome this problem, and to guarantee safety, the executive picked an area that already enjoyed good community relations and a degree of integration. It then wrote to people on its waiting list to ask them if they would be interested in shared housing. The idea was to gather people who were highly motivated to make shared housing work. In addition to people such as Michelle, single people, people from ethnic minority groups, and families - both Catholic and Protestant - who simply wanted to embrace integration signed up. \"This is the pilot, so we're establishing the principles,\" says Elma Newbury, director of the Housing Executive's recently established Community Cohesion Unit. The Housing Executive, together with Ulidia Housing Association, which manages the scheme, are funding a Shared Future officer, who will work with the residents to help form a community group and draw up a charter. They will sign up to principles such as mutual respect, choice and safety which are the ingredients of shared living. \"The vision is it's a shared neighbourhood where diversity is welcomed and communities are enriched through the cultural awareness that brings,\" says Newbury. The pilot scheme is designed to create a clear picture of what shared living would look like. It's a vision that's much needed in a region where people can live their whole lives with barely a meaningful encounter with anyone from the \"other\" tradition. The plan is to use this first scheme as a template for other shared schemes across Northern Ireland, with the question \"Would you opt to live in mixed housing?\" eventually becoming standard on housing application forms. Fast changing Northern Ireland's demographic profile is changing fast, which, says Newbury, is all the more reason for embracing shared housing now. \"What's key here is not just the political process, but also the whole dynamic and change within Northern Ireland with migrant workers, because that's going to increase every year. We need to get this approach bedded in now because that will prepare us for early intervention for changing communities as well.\" The next shared housing scheme is in Loughbrickland, County Down. For now, Belfast is considered too polarised to be a safe location, but Sharon longs for the day that will change. She is convinced that the will exists among ordinary people to make shared housing work. She says: \"I believe that if they make mixed communities in the future it's going to force people to accept the issue that there are families in this part of the world who are willing to live with each other and can live in peace. I'm sure if there was a mixed community and people tried to break that, neighbours would all stick together, I have no doubt.\" \u00b7 Any comments on this article?
