She instantly became a fan. But with that mantle came years of heartbreak, disappointment and frustration that sports fans around the world know all too well. Now, after Friday\u2019s victory over the reigning champion Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals, the Raptors are a single win away from their first-ever championship. And basketball fans in Toronto are experiencing a feeling that has been absent for more than two decades: hope. Paired up against a powerful but injury-riddled Warriors team, the Raptors can make history when the best-of seven series, which they lead 3-1, returns to Toronto on Monday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening. It\u2019s literally a dream come true. We\u2019ve had to fight so hard for this,\u201d says Hussein of the team\u2019s hard-won place in the championships. \u201cIt\u2019s mind blowing.\u201d Raptors fever is everywhere in Toronto. The raptor claw is on billboards, restaurant windows and inked into the skin of the most loyal fans. Even at a recent performance of the national ballet, the team\u2019s slogan: \u2018We the North\u2019, was projected onto a black curtain. Canada\u2019s largest city is no stranger to major sports franchises. Its vaunted Maple Leafs were a dynastic ice hockey force in the 1960s. The Blue Jays won the baseball World Series in 1993. But Toronto hasn\u2019t experienced the frenzied elation of a major sports championship in more than 20 years (Toronto FC won the MLS title in 2017, but soccer doesn\u2019t quite have the pull of hockey, baseball and basketball in Canada); there is an excitement that has infected much of the city. Part of the interest surrounding the team is a belief that basketball is the \u201csport of the future\u201d for Canada, says Toronto-based photographer Neil Ta. A longtime Raptors fan \u2013 and season\u2019s pass holder in recent years \u2013 he sees the sport not only captivating viewers, but reflecting the makeup of the city. \u201cIf you go to a [hockey game] the crowd is sort of very much one type of demographic. And when you go to a Raptors game, it\u2019s much more reflective of the city \u2013 and of the country,\u201d he says. Toronto is one of the most diverse cities in the world, and basketball resonates at a much wider level than other sports, accessible to both longtime residents and new arrivals, says Ta. \u201cI grew up with hockey. But because we were immigrants and not too well off, it was a sport that I could never play\u2026I couldn\u2019t afford the equipment and league fees,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with basketball, you know \u2026 pick up like a $5 rubber ball and you\u2019re pretty much set.\u201d It hasn\u2019t hurt the Raptors\u2019 immense popularity \u2013 in Toronto at least \u2013 that their \u2018global ambassador\u2019 and de-facto mascot is Drake, the award-winning hip-hop artist who has made it his mission to elevate the status of Toronto. But another component of the Raptors\u2019 success \u2013 and one which sports analysts have marvelled at since descending on Toronto as the finals began \u2013 are the city\u2019s obsessive fans. The beating heart of the team\u2019s support lies in Jurassic Park, a cordoned-off space outside the Raptors\u2019 home court, Scotiabank Arena. During the regular season, it is a lively space for the team\u2019s most loyal supporters. But when the Raptors qualified for the finals, Jurassic Park became a site of pilgrimage. Fans began lining up as early as 14 hours before the game to stake out prime viewing spots, forcing city officials to create spillover areas. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through some tough times and some rough times,\u201d says Kajan Thiruthanikasalam, a longtime fan who lined up hours before the first game of the NBA finals for a spot close to the giant screen. \u201cBut if this is reward we\u2019re getting right now, so be it.\u201d For years, he and other fans watched with anticipation as the team approached the playoffs, only to wind up knocked out of contention early on. \u201cWe had a few years of what I\u2019d call fools gold,\u201d says Adon Moss, a longtime fan who now watches the games from his home in Newfoundland. \u201cThey looked like they\u2019d break through. But it was never really ever going to happen.\u201d But the vagaries of professional sports mean teams change and adapt. Last summer, the Raptors acquired Kawhi Leonard, one of the best players in the league. \u201c[Leonard] has made us believe in this team. He\u2019s instilled a new life into this city,\u201d says Thiruthanikasalam. As the Raptors pursue the franchise\u2019s first NBA championship, Jurassic Park has expanded well outside downtown Toronto. Movie theatres have offered free screenings of games, only to have tickets quickly sell out. Cities across the country have created public viewing spaces. The message is clear: the Raptors aren\u2019t just a Toronto phenomenon; they\u2019re becoming Canada\u2019s team. Even in the far north, committed fans are ecstatic at the prospect of an NBA championship. In the community of Rankin Inlet, 1,500 miles north-west of Toronto, artist Noah Tiktak has cheered on the team for years. \u201cI was a [Chicago] Bulls fan when [Michael] Jordan played and then lost a bit of interest after he retired,\u201d says Tiktak. \u201cThen the Raptors came along \u2013 a team from Canada!\u201d The run has been \u201cexciting\u201d says Tiktak, who recently made an Inuit drum with a Raptors logo on the front and the words \u201cWe the North, Literally\u201d on the back. The Raptors\u2019 success has also encouraged more young fans to play basketball, says Hussein. She works with Hijabi Ballers, an organization in the greater Toronto area that coaches young athletes and promotes sport for girls in the Muslim community. Despite being Canada\u2019s \u2013 and Toronto\u2019s \u2013 team, only a single Raptor, Chris Boucher, is Canadian. For some, that only increases the appeal and captures what has made residents such fervent supporters: the team is a group of scrappy underdogs, overlooked by the rest of the league \u2013 much like the city itself. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be from here to represent this place,\u201d says Ta. \u201cNot everyone who lives here is from here. That\u2019s really the story of Toronto.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
