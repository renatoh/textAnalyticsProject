Anjem Choudry, a British born spokesman for the pro-al Qaeda al-Muhajiroun group, was scheduled to speak at a Trinity debate on 9 October. But after former Taoiseach John Bruton threatened on Friday to pull out of the meeting the event's organisers, the University's Philosophical Society, cancelled Choudry's invitation. The society had already bought plane tickets and booked a hotel for the al-Muhajiroun spokesman. The extreme Muslim group caused widespread outrage in Britain last week after it called the September 11 hijackers 'the Magnificent 19'. On Friday morning Bruton told the society he was not prepared to take part if the al-Muhajiroun speaker was on the same platform. 'I made it clear to them that throughout my political life I would not sit and talk to unrepentant terrorists or their supporters. 'I refused to share platforms, for instance, with Sinn Fein while the IRA's violence was ongoing and only after the ceasefires was I prepared to do so. 'Given that al-Qaeda is at war with the West and engaged in acts of terrorism I am not willing to sit down with their apologists,' he said last night. The former Fine Gael leader said he wanted to use the conference to encourage Europeans and Americans to build bridges. 'One of the things I wanted to say was that Ireland could be that bridge, that we are in a unique position to do so given that our nation gets a good hearing in Washington DC,' he added. Choudry said he had hoped to articulate Islam's message through the debate at one of the world's oldest universities. The meeting is being broadcast live on RTE Radio 1 and screened later on America's NBC television network. 'I wanted to tell the students about the thousand years of Islamic rule in Spain and Jerusalem where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived side by side,' he said. The 41-year-old London-based solicitor also said he wanted to explain the concept of jihad to students and the wider Irish public during the debate. 'We want to get across to a wide audience about the struggle for sharia law and the real reasons behind the war between Osama bin Laden and his followers and America,' he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
