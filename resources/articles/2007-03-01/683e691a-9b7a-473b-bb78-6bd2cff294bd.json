For the past five months I've been putting both skills to use as editor and creative director of a men's style magazine called Upstreet, which might best be described as a big storybook. My hobby is hard to pin down, but in a nutshell I collect stuff. Typewriters, plastic mini-cameras with scenic holiday snaps in them, badges, postcards. I also have an inclination towards things to do with the royal family. I love all my tat for its colour and life. It makes me happy to see it all together shouting away for our attention, but I don't have the obsessive compulsive gusto to take it to the next level. By contrast, a friend of mine has collected tens of thousands of records, with up to a dozen versions of any one LP, but because he knows what they sound like, he doesn't have a record player. Collections can become afflictions that end up taking over people's homes and lives. Maybe having lots of them is my defence against that. By being a magpie, I never let one obsession become all-consuming. If anyone tries to flog me \"collectables\" I'm not interested, it's the discovering that counts - and helps make the story. With my camera I'm collecting images, which ideally are little stories, and likewise with my words. My aim with Upstreet is to entertain and inspire - and the best way is via a good yarn. The things I collect are all visually pleasing, but it's the tales behind them that are best. Every one is a little piece of social history. So, if I collect any thing, it's probably stories. \u00b7 Writer-photographer Myles Quin was talking to Maia Adams"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
