The European council president, a well-known critic of Putin\u2019s regime, was the most outspoken in his response to the Russian president\u2019s comments in an interview with the Financial Times. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland who was briefly imprisoned for his role in the anti-communist Solidarity movement, contrasted the principles underpinning liberal democracies with rule through \u201cpersonality cults\u201d. Speaking at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Tusk said: \u201cI have to say that I strongly disagree with the main argument that liberalism is obsolete. We are here as Europeans also to firmly and univocally defend and promote liberal democracy. \u201cWhoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete. \u201cFor us in Europe, these are and will remain essential and vibrant values. What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d Putin had used a 90-minute interview with the FT to claim \u201cthe liberal idea\u201d had \u201coutlived its purpose\u201d, and the public had turned their back on social tolerance, multiculturalism and immigration. Putin claimed migrants in western democracies had been allowed to \u201ckill, plunder and rape with impunity\u201d. He also appeared to criticise the social tolerance of liberal societies. \u201cThey claim now that children can play five or six gender roles,\u201d Putin told the newspaper. \u201cI cannot even say exactly what genders these are. I have no notion. Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that.\u201d The absence of any comment from the US president, Donald Trump, about Putin\u2019s claims was notable. But a spokesman for Theresa May said she had challenged Putin\u2019s attack on the liberal order at a frosty private meeting. The British prime minister also publicly condemned Russia for the use by its intelligence services of novichok nerve agent in Salisbury. Downing Street said May had told Putin that \u201cthe UK would continue to unequivocally defend liberal democracy and protect the human rights and equality of all groups, including LGBT people\u201d. Boris Johnson told a Conservative leadership hustings that Putin was \u201ctotally wrong\u201d, and said he had failed in his ambition of forging a new relationship with Russia when foreign secretary. \u201cI went to Moscow in defiance of a lot of advice. I tried to build a new friendship and a new partnership and it just isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said in Exeter. \u201cAll this stuff Putin comes up with about \u2018liberalism is over\u2019 is wrong. He is totally wrong. Our values \u2013 freedom, democracy, free speech \u2013 those things are imperishable and they will succeed.\u201d The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, also restated the EU\u2019s commitment to a \u201crules-based order\u201d. Latvia\u2019s defence minister, Artis Pabriks, used an interview with Euronews to call on all western leaders to recognise the threat posed by the Kremlin. He said: \u201cBeing a border country, we have been facing Russian airplanes, Russian ships next to our border, daily. \u201cAs they are coming very close, they have different interferences. Of course, they are also interfering from time to time, as far as political events happening in our country, let\u2019s say support for some political forces, political parties \u2026 \u201cAnd this, what is happening in the Baltics, in Latvia, you can consider as a litmus test for Russian hybrid [inaudible] against many other western nations, as far as the elections in the US or in France, or Brexit, or other places, or elections to the European parliament, because their purpose, in general, is to create larger influence in global world by diminishing [the] power of [the] opponent.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
