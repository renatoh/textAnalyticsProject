It is one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema. It really is avant-garde, with scarcely any dialogue and a tottering megastructure of myth and symbol, from Mormonism to masonic ritual to Celtic legend. But it's not like those artists' films you sit through because you should, nor is it is only fun when projected as a zany installation. The five films - particularly the most recent, Cremaster 2 and 3 - are in a class and a universe of their own. As Norman Mailer, who appears in Cremaster 2, said after seeing it: \"I enjoyed it. How could you not enjoy it?\" The cycle was begun eight years ago and, now that it has been completed, it can finally be assessed. What is apparent is that this is The Waste Land for a generation that grew up with Star Wars. Like TS Eliot's poem, this series of films tries to salvage what in myth, ritual and art is still accessible to the modern world. Eliot's modern wasteland was the London of the early 20th century, with its fogs, crowds of commuters on London Bridge and a typist waiting for \"the young man carbuncular\". Barney's modern world, however, is defined by death metal and Vaseline, and his myths all have their point of origin and their destination in the cremaster, a muscle that connects the scrotum to the male body. To get how good it is, you should really start in the middle. With a running length of over three hours, no dialogue and a purely symbolic narrative, Cremaster 3, the last to be made, is easily the best American film since Mulholland Drive. Its star is New York's Chrysler Building, a skyscraper with hauteur, a true capitalist temple that, unlike the Empire State Building, does not welcome visitors (I have been thrown out twice). As reimagined and rebuilt by Barney - its secret interiors lovingly recreated with strange alterations - it is a temple of verticality, a masonic power centre, a constellation of evil forces. In Barney's fantasy, it is the masterpiece of sinister architect and Freemason, Hiram Abiff, played by the American sculptor Richard Serra. Barney's Chrysler Building is also the final resting place of the executed murderer Gary Gilmore. In a sequence of hypnotic horror, the corpse of Gilmore is exhumed inside a cavernous subterranean vault. Decay has turned Gilmore into a decomposed woman, who is carried in ritual procession into the lobby of the Chrysler Building and placed in the back seat of a 1938 Chrysler Imperial parked in the centre of the grand marble and metal hall. Five later Chrysler models parked in the lobby rev up and take turns, in a choreographed rite, to ram into the old, lovely automobile. Gradually, by this merciless pummelling, it is destroyed, crumpled, reduced to a tiny crystalline clump of metal that, later, will be pushed into Barney's mouth as he lies helpless in a souped-up dentist's chair at the top of the building. When the metal is shoved into his bleeding mouth, Barney's character, The Entered Apprentice, extrudes his guts from his anus. OK, it's weird. But The Cremaster Cycle is much more than a pose or a series of eye-popping images. It is beautiful, disturbing, of our time, aspiring to be eternal, sensually in love with the textures of modernity - plastics, synthetics, nylon - yet longing for the ancient mythic resonance of honey, beeswax, salt and ice. It is cinema, sculpture and performance, and it is a significant work of art. In a note to The Waste Land, published in 1922, Eliot acknowledged that its title, plan and symbolism were suggested by Jessie L Weston's book on the Grail legend, From Ritual to Romance (seen at Marlon Brando's bedside in Apocalypse Now). This desire to reawaken the language and imagery of ancient, organic patterns of thought is central to modern American art and literature. It's there in the greatest American novels - Moby-Dick, Gravity's Rainbow - and in the greatest American cinema, in the blood-letting rites of passage in The Godfather. Barney's Cremaster Cycle also tries to find pattern in chaos, to give us back some of the imaginative sustenance of myth and symbol. Where Coppola and Scorsese found a deep well of myth and ritual in Italian Catholicism, Barney - who belongs to a generation cut off by mass media, irony and time from cultural tradition - has pieced together his own mythology, his own rituals, his own history, from assorted fragments. Some of these are personally connected to him - he is from Gilmore's midwest, he has Celtic forebears, he lives in New York - but most are common to the culture. The troubling thing is that The Cremaster Cycle's layers of myth don't add up. They are mutually contradictory. You could (if you were mad enough) follow each line of thought and produce a single reading of the series of films and accompanying sculptures and photographs, but that is beside the point. Barney's aesthetic is one of overload. There are simply too many images, too many ransackings of history and religion, to digest. Mormon religious beliefs, masonic initiation rites, the Celtic giant Fingal and his nemesis Finn MacCool, Irish Republicanism, the Man in Black, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, American football, Norman Mailer, Harry Houdini, the Great Salt Lake, satyrs and nymphs, grand opera, the Legs of Man: these and other tropes Barney wheels out and wheels away. He finds enough allusive connections between one remote place and time and another to make it all apparently cohere - but he also lets you know he is probably joking. The very title of his gesamtkunstwerk is comically deflationary. If \"Cycle\" sounds Wagnerian, imposing, the fact that it is named after the cremaster muscle implies that this might just be a great big act of masturbation. Not that the images Barney creates with confidence and dreamy clarity do not form webs and honeycombs of meaning. Take a pint of Guinness. In Cremaster 3, after making a muddy earthwork in the Chrysler's elevator, The Entered Apprentice climbs the elevator shaft and emerges inside the Chrysler's crowning silver ziggurat, in the Art-Deco Cloud Club. The only drink available is Guinness. It is served ritualistically, and its viscous black density and creamy head fit perfectly with the fluid, gooey textures Barney celebrates - petroleum jelly and blood being his favourites. The Chrysler Building's Cloud Club is a real place, though not attainable with ease; in Barney's universe, it becomes a threshold between heaven and earth, America and Ireland. It has a snug - a warm, secluded back room occupied by a gang of Freemason gangsters. They sip Guinness with reverence. They say nothing. The drinking of Guinness high above New York connects this part of the film to a hilarious finale depicting the ancient Irish giant Finn MacCool, disguised as an 18ft baby, biting the hand of the Scottish giant Fingal and chasing him from Ireland, throwing huge chunks of rock after him, one of which lands in the sea and becomes the Isle of Man (the setting for Cremaster 4). Other Celtic elements include a triumphant sequence in which the Chrysler becomes a giant maypole trailing ribbons the colours of the Irish flag, while Barney ascends the interior of Welsh-blooded Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum, not up the spiralling ramp but climbing in a straight, vertical line from one parapet to the next. It's not hard to see the snug of the Cloud Club bar as womb-like, secluded and safe. The retreat into and re-emergence from wombs seems to be a recurrent theme. In Cremaster 1, the performance artist Marti Domination plays Goodyear, who lies trapped and curious in a white, plasticky space underneath a table in the cabin of the Goodyear Blimp. Gary Gilmore, played by Barney in Cremaster 2 as a bearded cowboy ogre, is first seen in his car parked at a gas station in an isolated nowhere in the middle of America; to be precise, he is inside a long, honeycombed tunnel that connects two cars, like an organic membrane. It is when he is disturbed in this sweet reverie that Gilmore shoots dead pump attendant Max Jensen - the crime for which, at his own request, Gilmore was executed by firing squad in 1977. Gilmore was made into an American myth by Norman Mailer in The Executioner's Song, and Mailer appears in Cremaster 2 as escapologist Harry Houdini, from whom, story has it, Gilmore was descended. The allusion, suggestion and explicit theological reference is so dense with potential meaning that it mocks us. The honeycomb structure that appears in Cremaster 2 and recurs in the hexagonal formation of the Giant's Causeway where Finn fights Fingal, for instance, is an element in Mormon myth. Barney's world is foaming with meaning, drowning in it. The apparently empty, desolate American wasteland in which Gilmore shoots a man just to see him die (as Gilmore's idol Johnny Cash would have put it) is revealed not to be empty at all. It is dangerously teeming with history: the Mormon upbringing and ancestry of Gilmore, the heretical beliefs of the 19th-century settlers who built Jerusalem beside the Great Salt Lake. Finally, for all its detours to Ireland and Fingal's Cave, this is an American myth. Gilmore's self-sacrifice takes the form of a wild bull ride at a rodeo - a stunt worthy of MTV's Jackass - in a salt enclosure in the sublime landscape of the Great Salt Lake. Afterwards, the camera flies away across the landscape. We see incredible things as we move north, from the blue and pink sunset over Utah to Canada's Columbian ice field. The camera enters echoing mountain deeps clogged with ice and, in the middle of the ice field of north America, discovers a single hotel. It is like the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's The Shining, but a real place: the remote Banff Springs Hotel. Cinema and Art have circled each other, squared up to each other, over the years, but only occasionally come together, as here, convincingly. At the heart of The Cremaster Cycle, halfway through Cremaster 3, is a homage to Dali and Bunuel. We see a horse-and-trap race, gorgeously filmed in the early morning mists of Saratoga Springs racecourse in New York State. Only gradually, close up, do we realise that the horses are putrefying carcasses, zombie horses, like the rotting donkey on top of a piano dragged across the floor by two priests in Un Chien Andalou. The Cremaster Cycle should be seen not just as a major American work of art but as a real piece of American cinema. It is in another league from the video and film installations that have become so central to contemporary art, which function, and only aspire to function, in museums, protected from the dirty mayhem of mainstream cinema. Barney's rich yet fragile, vast yet humorous, indulgences of the mythic imagination have more in common with an 18th-century pleasure garden than they do with current art. He creates meaning and destroys it with careless, and frightening, ease. After watching his films you feel, like Eliot's J Alfred Prufrock, that you have lingered in the chambers of the sea, \"Till human voices wake us, and we drown\". Here is a world that is as real as a dream, and as impossible to make sense of, outside its self-contained cinematic space. You can theorise it, analyse it, tell stories about it. But the magic has already disappeared. \u00b7 The Cremaster Cycle and a sculpture, Cremaster Field, are at the Ritzy, London SW2, from October 25, presented by Artangel. Details: 020-7713 1402.
