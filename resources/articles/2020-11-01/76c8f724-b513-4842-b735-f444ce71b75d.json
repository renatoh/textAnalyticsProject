England were officially crowned Six Nations champions on Sunday with a biosecure trophy presentation at their Teddington base following what Jones described as a night of celebrations to remember in Rome after their rusty victory over Italy, and France\u2019s subsequent win over Ireland, sealed the title. After a few days off England will reconvene on Thursday to begin preparations for their Autumn Nations Cup campaign, beginning at home to Georgia on 14 November, and with a second national lockdown imminent, Jones again reminded his players of their responsibilities, warning them that they are the microscope after the Barbarians fiasco reduced rugby union to \u201ca laughing stock\u201d. An outbreak of several Covid-19 cases among the Fiji squad also serves as the need to remain vigilant with Autumn Nations Cup organisers investigating and desperately hoping the competition still goes ahead as planned. On Sunday however, England were at least able to bask in their success and a title that looked unlikely when they followed up their World Cup defeat by South Africa with a lacklustre opening defeat in France. The 23-man squad in Italy featured four debutants and 10 changes from that which lost to the Springboks. \u201cWe\u2019ve evolved through this tournament, some of it through injury, where we\u2019re building a new team that is going to take us to [the] greatest heights in the next four years,\u201d said Jones. \u201cLosing a World Cup final can be quite traumatic. It puts a dent in you and it leaves a scar that you carry around for the rest of your life. You\u2019ve got to find a way to get forward again.\u201d England watched France\u2019s win over Ireland at their hotel given the strict Covid protocols in place in Rome and Jones believes his players will benefit from the shared experience. He added: \u201cThey had a few beers and a few wines. It was one of those nights you do remember. From that you develop stronger bonds and relationships that can help you in the future. \u201cThat then transposes itself to certain situations on the field where you look like the best orchestra in the world where everything\u2019s moving together and it looks like everyone knows exactly what the other person is doing.\u201d Jones is expected to make a number of changes against Georgia but revealed George Ford is \u201cborderline\u201d with an ongoing achilles injury. Victory would set up their title tilt with subsequent pool matches against Ireland and Wales before a final ranking match and Jones reiterated his wish to \u201cput smiles on people\u2019s faces\u201d as the second wave of the pandemic takes hold. \u201cAll of our players are aware of their responsibilities, as are the staff,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be cognisant of the fact that everyone is looking at what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve got to be so gracious for the opportunity. We understand that responsibility and we want to make sure again that we try to put smiles on people\u2019s faces.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
