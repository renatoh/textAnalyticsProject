But rather than settle into a quiet retirement, he has taken on a series of boardroom roles, making the son of a Scottish village policeman more money than he earned as a politician - in excess of \u00a3500,000 a year. Like others who got to the upper reaches of government, the former defence secretary, now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, has positions with companies which pay large sums to get politicians on board. The path from Whitehall to the corporate world is visible and well-trodden, but what those companies want former politicians to do is usually hidden. Now, documents released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act have shed light on the activities of people such as Lord Robertson. They show that last year he obtained, among other things, a meeting with his old colleague, trade minister Ian Pearson, on behalf of the ailing multinational telecoms company Cable and Wireless. The minutes of the meeting note that Lord Robertson \"stressed that he was still new to telecoms\". It was not the first time he had been in touch with the Department of Trade and Industry. He had lobbied Stephen Brown, the civil servant who heads its export agency. Now, he renewed his pleas. \"This was another occasion to ask for active government support of Cable and Wireless's international ventures,\" the minutes say. The minutes also say that Mr Pearson agreed to help. Censored minutes Lord Robertson says: \"I am not a lobbyist\". He says he was hired two years ago to improve the company's relations with British and foreign governments. He got \u00a3421,601, including a \u00a3200,000 bonus, last year for working two days a week. Before the Pearson meeting in July, DTI officials briefed the minister: \"We understand Lord Robertson has a broad concern that Cable and Wireless has not been explaining its global investment objectives and activities to the right people in government. He is likely therefore ... to reference the kinds of problems and regulatory concerns where HMG support would help them.\" The briefing noted that C&amp;W had had a monopoly in former British colonies, but \"struggled in the 1990s, following the liberalisation of the telecom markets, to move from a comfortable monopoly situation to one of competition and falling telecom charges\". Last week, the chief executive, Francesco Caio, quit, the share price sank and \u00a3285m of its value was wiped out. Although large parts of the minutes of the meeting are censored, they record how Lord Robertson stated that C&amp;W wanted political help with governments in Afghanistan, Panama, the Maldives, Bahrain and some Caribbean countries. Lord Robertson's track record since leaving high public office mirrors that of previous former ministers in Labour and Tory governments. A study by Labour Research Department in 2004 found that more than a third of the 92 former ministers who had left government since May 1997 had become company directors and consultants. Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, became an adviser to Bridgepoint Capital, a venture capital company looking to win NHS contracts. Peter Mandelson advised AM Conseil, a French industrial consultancy. Former trade minister Baroness Symons joined British Airways, P&amp;O and US law firm DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary, while the former Scottish secretary Helen Liddell is a consultant for British Energy. At the peak of their earning power, John Major and Margaret Thatcher are reported to have earned more than \u00a31m a year after leaving No 10. Mr Major is on the board of the US-based Carlyle Group, which is due to reap huge profits from the privatisation of QinetiQ, the government's defence and security technology agency. There has been criticism that politicians are exploiting their political contacts and knowledge to cash in after they have left office. But Lord Robertson says this is \"rubbish and not valid\". He says everyone trades on their past connections, not just politicians. \"We are free agents. Lots of people do it. I left Nato, I was 58, and I felt I could do another big job.\" He says he was hired by C&amp;W not only for his contacts book, but for his experience in managing large organisations. \"After about two years, you run out of contacts,\" he says. He says it is \"not surprising\" for companies to meet the trade minister. Ministers are obliged to consult a Whitehall committee if they want to go into business within two years of leaving the government. This committee can recommend delays or restrictions. Lord Robertson has capitalised on his friendship with William Cohen, the defence secretary in Bill Clinton's administration, who pays him for help with lobbying. The Washington-based Cohen Group says it has won military contracts from the MoD and other European countries for commercial clients, but refused to say how Lord Robertson had been involved. Lord Robertson says they \"bonded\" when they were defence secretaries. Lord Robertson wrote to him at the time: \"We are all profoundly grateful for the leadership provided ... by the US. On a personal level ... your wise advice makes a tremendous difference. It is extremely reassuring to know that we stand alongside a faithful friend.\" Mr Cohen wrote back: \"I am grateful that you prove to be an equally constant source of valued insight and judicious counsel.\" Lord Robertson denies he was getting \u00a3250,000 a year from Mr Cohen. \"It's a fraction of that,\" he says. Last year, Lord Robertson did receive \u00a340,000 from the military aerospace company Smiths Group, and \u00a332,000 from Weir Group, which sells weapons systems to the Royal Navy. Weir is facing a possible Serious Fraud Office investigation for allegedly paying bribes in Iraq. Undisclosed sum Lord Robertson is paid an undisclosed sum by London-based financiers Englefield Capital. The firm says he advises on global trends and specific areas where the firm wants to do business. Englefield has interests in Slovakia, which Lord Robertson visited last autumn, funded by the US-based Friends of Slovakia. Englefield says he did no work for it on that trip. Lord Robertson is also a \"strategic adviser\" to the European arm of the Royal Bank of Canada, which reportedly pays him \u00a3100,000 a year. The bank said yesterday his advice was on \"infrastructure finance\". \"Lord Robertson has strong connections in Scotland, and also has in-depth knowledge of the public sector,\" it said. BP also benefits from his advice, but he told the Guardian that although he has attended seminars, he has yet to agree a regular fee. The US connection There is a growing global trend for recently retired politicians to market themselves. In the US, observers call the system Statesmen on Call. \u00b7 The Cohen Group Launched in 2001 by former US defence secretary William Cohen, who recruited Lord Robertson \u00b7 The Albright Group Set up in 2001 by Madeleine Albright, President Clinton's secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 \u00b7 The Scowcroft Group Lt Gen Brent Scowcroft was national security adviser to President Bush's father during the 1991 Gulf war \u00b7 Hills &amp; Company Carla Hills was US trade representative in President George Bush's cabinet 1989-1993 \u00b7 Stonebridge International Led by President Clinton's national security adviser Sandy Berger \u00b7 Kissinger Associates Founded in 1982 by former secretary of state Henry Kissinger \u00b7 The Carlyle Group Operates as a merchant bank, using its political connections \"to generate extraordinary returns\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
