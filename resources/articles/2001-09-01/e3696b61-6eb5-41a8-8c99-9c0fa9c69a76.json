They have flooded tour operators, airlines, the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and the Association of British Travel Agents with calls since the attack happened last Tuesday, when hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. All flights to North America were temporarily suspended and travellers were generally being offered either full refunds or alternative holidays for trips departing before 18 September to New York, Boston and Washington and 16 September for other destinations in the US and Canada. But as Escape went to press, there was no extension of those deadlines planned. The assumption was that with flights due to operate normally by those dates with the reopening of American airspace, changes to holiday plans after that time would not be necessary. Tour operators said that unless the Foreign Office advised against travel to the United States, holidaymakers booked after those dates would not be reimbursed if they chose not to go. Keith Betton, spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'So long as it is safe to go to New York, there is no reason why package holidays should not resume.' A spokeswoman from Bridge Travel confirmed that after those dates, normal cancellation fees would apply. 'If they really don't fancy going, unfortunately, that is their decision,' she said. Travelscene, which has city breaks to New York, said it would be giving further guidelines to travellers as the situation became clearer. The confusion also covered travel to countries with large Muslim populations after the Foreign Office advised visitors to 'exercise particular caution given heightened tension in the Middle East'. Operators said holidays were currently unaffected with the exception of Pakistan, where the Foreign Office has advised against travel. Trips there are being cancelled and refunded. But Donna Ellis from Glasgow, who is due to travel on a family holiday to Egypt with Thomson this week, said: 'Nobody really has a clue. We don't know what to do. We don't know whether we are coming or going.' Meanwhile, tour companies said bookings to the United States had dropped off completely and business was 'quiet' in general. The Christmas shopping market, normally one of New York's busiest periods, is likely to be hard hit. 'There isn't going to be a huge amount of demand,' said a Travelscene spokeswoman. 'There will be flights and accommodation available - normally accommodation is a problem in New York before Christmas, so there will be some deals around.' Where to go and how to find the right advice North America If you have a booking to travel to Boston, New York or Washington before 18 September, most operators are offering a refund or alternative travel arrangements. Consult your travel agent or tour operator on travel after that date, but refunds are unlikely unless the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office advises against travel. Travel insurance is unlikely to cover cancellation if it is your own choice. Muslim countries The Foreign Office has advised against travel to Pakistan and operators are offering refunds or alternative holidays. Other destinations remain unaffected, and you won't get any money back from cancellations, though travellers are advised to be extra vigilant. General advice \u0095 Contact your travel agent, tour operator or airline for specific help. \u0095 Allow an extra hour for extra security checks at the airport. \u0095 Find out whether your airline is allowing hand baggage on the plane - some want it checked in. Travel with a minimum of hand luggage in bags that can be locked if they have to be put in the hold.
