The Italian, who has been out of work since his sacking by Chelsea in September, will succeed Graham Taylor, who is retiring from club management at the end of the season. Vialli's signing represents a major coup for the club, whose chairman Sir Elton John will open this morning's press conference via a satellite link from the United States. Oxford United have sacked their manager David Kemp and his assistant Alan McLeary after only six months in charge. The former Oxford player Mike Ford took temporary charge for last night's game against Port Vale, the final match at the Manor Ground. Manchester United have made what is believed to be football history by signing a 12-year-old from Preston in a deal that could eventually cost them \u00a3136,000. Daniel Rowe is the leading striker in Preston's under-13 team. But in a unique deal a Football Association tribunal, which included the Barnsley manager Dave Bassett, has ruled that he can move to Old Trafford to further his football education. Under the scheme United must pay \u00a38,000 up front, \u00a38,000 more if he signs a scholarship, \u00a320,000 if he turns professional and \u00a3100,000 on completing 10 first-team games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
