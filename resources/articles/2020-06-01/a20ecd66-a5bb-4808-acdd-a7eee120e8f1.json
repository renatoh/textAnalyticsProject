Chelsea are targeting Havertz and Chilwell after confirming the signings of RB Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner and Ajax\u2019s Hakim Ziyech but Lampard insisted he had no intention of losing Kant\u00e9, even though the manager accepted some squad members could be sold when the transfer window opens. Kant\u00e9, who is available to face Aston Villa on Sunday after putting aside his safety fears over coronavirus, has made 22 appearances in all competitions this season after struggling with injuries. However Lampard, who is unsure whether Pedro and Willian will agree short-term deals to the end of the season, said the 29-year-old France midfielder was in his long-term plans. \u201cIn terms of N\u2019Golo, I\u2019ve seen some talk and reports about him and his future at the club,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI\u2019ve said it a lot of times about N\u2019Golo \u2013 one of the best midfield players in the world. I would have loved to be able to play with him. He has everything. \u201cComing back to Chelsea and having N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is something I really want to appreciate and work with. Because of injuries it\u2019s been tough for N\u2019Golo. It\u2019s nice to see him a little bit fresh. N\u2019Golo is so important to us going forward. We need him regularly and hopefully we\u2019ll have that now.\u201d Chelsea have until Tuesday to convince Pedro and Willian to extend their contracts past 30 June. Pedro has agreed to join Roma on a free and there is little clarity over Willian\u2019s future but Lampard expects to use the veteran wingers for the trip to Villa, Thursday\u2019s home game against Manchester City and next Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final against Leicester. \u201cWe want them to make sure they see out the season,\u201d he said. \u201cPedro is certainly available. He actually had a bit of a bang on his ankle last week but he\u2019s fit and wanting to train. He\u2019s training well. So is Willian. I have got absolutely no worries about motivation. They are both top-class professionals.\u201d Lampard said Callum Hudson-Odoi, who will face no further police action after an allegation of rape, must knuckle down after a breach of lockdown last month. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that in the eyes of the law it\u2019s been sorted out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my main concern at first. I\u2019m very sympathetic to the idea that we\u2019re not angels or saints and we make mistakes, particularly at a young age. \u201cThe big conversation with Callum now is to make sure he learns his lesson from what happened. He broke lockdown and that wasn\u2019t good enough. He\u2019s admitted that and we move on. The next thing is to train consistently at a really high level. He came back from lockdown and got injured early so now he\u2019s having to work hard to get fit again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
