As far as games of rugby go, Widnes\u2019s draw with Wigan had everything. A controversial red card seems to be somewhat commonplace in the game these days after the unforgettable actions of Ben Flower in last year\u2019s Super League Grand Final, but this game was about so much more than the dismissal of Patrick Ah Van. Ah Van was shown a straight red for a dangerous shot on England international Josh Charnley midway through the first half, and had Wigan taken their chances towards the end of that first half the contest could have produced a much different outcome, as the Vikings continued to reel. While that dismissal seriously threatened to overshadow the contest at one point, the spirit and endeavour of Widnes \u2013 who were trailing 16-0 midway through the first half \u2013 grabbed them a quite incredible point. Buoyed on in front of their biggest crowd since they returned to Super League in 2012, they clawed their way back despite the loss of their captain, Kevin Brown, to a nasty head injury in the first period. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of days like that before where we\u2019ve played with 12 men,\u201d said the Widnes coach, Denis Betts. \u201cWhat you saw tonight was character; the kind of thing you can\u2019t buy. You have to grow it and nurture it, and we saw a massive effort from those lads. Factor in we lost Kevin early on too, and that is a big result.\u201d For Wigan, though, the result will stand as a point lost, as their dismal record on the opening day of the season continues. They have now won just four of their last 15 opening-day fixtures, and will look back on a number of missed opportunities to blow the Vikings out of sight with a numerical advantage. \u201cWe gave away eight penalties in the second half, and rightly or wrongly awarded, they got those penalties,\u201d said the Wigan coach, Shaun Wane, who confirmed afterwards that Charnley was \u201cin a bit of a mess\u201d after that controversial tackle from Ah Van. \u201cWe invited them into areas we shouldn\u2019t have done; we had to be squeaky clean after that red card and unfortunately we weren\u2019t.\u201d Wigan were arguably more fluent against 13 men, and they were 10-0 up early on thanks to tries from Joel Tomkins and Anthony Gelling, before the game\u2019s big moment arrived in the 23rd minute. Ah Van was dismissed by the referee, James Child, for a wild swipe and with their man advantage Wigan began to tear loose, Gelling trotting over shortly after for his second \u2013 but Widnes would haul themselves back into it before the break. The England wing Joe Burgess had already blown one golden opportunity to further extend Wigan\u2019s lead, and when he spilled another routine pass just before the break, the Widnes half-back Joe Mellor picked up and scampered to the line to make it 16-6. Suddenly, it was game on. And the game was even more on soon after the break when Rhys Hanbury crossed to reduce the arrears even further. Handling errors were still proving to be a problem for the Warriors in attack, but they would finally put together a slick handling move to re-open a healthy lead on 55 minutes, with Burgess finally making one stick to cross for his first try of 2015. Widnes, typical of their revival up to this point, fought back again through Rhys Hanbury, setting up an incredible grandstand finish on the first night of the game\u2019s new era. And the points were ultimately split when Chris Dean dived in under the posts, with Stefan Marsh\u2019s goal ensuring a thrilling comeback for the Vikings. If this was rugby league\u2019s exciting new era at play, then fans are in for a rollercoaster ride in 2015.
