But don\u2019t panic: he didn\u2019t vote Liberal Democrat either. Not for him the (supposed) treachery of Alastair Campbell. In fact, he didn\u2019t vote at all. The former mayor of London was in Angola, making a speech to the World Tourism Forum, a trip that came up at the last moment, leaving him with no time to arrange a postal vote. Did the result, disastrous for both Labour and the Tories, shock him? (In west Africa for less than 24 hours, he was back in good time for the TV coverage.) No, not at all. It struck him as utterly predictable and he sees no cause for concern on the Labour side. \u201cI think there\u2019s a consensus now that Labour have got to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU,\u201d he insists, as if such a position was the most straightforward thing in the world. (It isn\u2019t, especially since the byelection in Peterborough, a constituency that voted strongly to leave, which Labour managed to win.) Livingstone\u2019s old comrade Jeremy Corbyn, whose fence-sitting in this matter barely serves to conceal his Leaver tendencies, will soon, he believes, have other things on his mind than the question of Europe. \u201cJeremy has always been a critic of the EU,\u201d he says, almost fondly (Livingstone voted Remain in the referendum, \u201cwithout any doubt\u201d in his mind at all). \u201cAnd half of Labour MPs are in seats that voted to leave, so they thought they\u2019d have to respect that. But I think that\u2019s all behind us now. There isn\u2019t a majority in parliament for leaving without a deal and the Tories are going to elect a leader who will go for a hard Brexit. So there must be a prospect of a general election soon.\u201d Labour will, he claims, win this election and thereafter it will swiftly become clear that Brexit was merely \u201ca brief diversion\u201d. Britain will stay in the EU and Corbyn and John McDonnell will then set about leading what he believes will be the best and most reforming Labour government since that of Clement Attlee in 1945. Crikey. As conversations go, this one has certainly kicked off at high speed. What makes it all the more dizzying \u2013 the idea that Brexit is just a \u201cbrief diversion\u201d strikes me as preposterous, if not a touch mad \u2013 is that it is so unexpected. For one thing, Livingstone is ostensibly here to talk about Livingstone\u2019s London: A Celebration of People and Places, a gentle little book full of historical statistics and stuff about blue plaques that he has written for a new publishing company set up by his wife\u2019s two sisters; before our meeting was fixed, we were told that he wasn\u2019t keen to talk about politics. For another, his words, punchy and far reaching, are somewhat at odds with his bearing. He\u2019s perfectly affable, a smile permanently spread across his face, but there\u2019s something rather frail and depleted about him, too: if he talks proudly of being a house-husband, behind the boast it\u2019s possible to detect a certain purposelessness and sense of loss. His wide, royal blue braces only add to this effect. They seem to belong to another man altogether. He and I meet in a private club in Soho (neither of us is a member) on the morning of Trump\u2019s visit \u2013 and yes, if he wasn\u2019t seeing me, he would be out there protesting alongside Corbyn. \u201cThis is the worst president of my lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cA most irrational man and if things go wrong, we\u2019re going to have a bloody war.\u201d He travelled here on the tube and will return home the same way; he never learned to drive and no, he has never ridden a Boris bike, either. Outside, a pneumatic drill attacks another London street, but the terrible din seems to affect Livingstone far less than it does me. His answers to my questions are long and digressive, reaching ever further backwards into the past. I have the feeling that whatever lengths he might have gone to when he was mayor to protect his privacy, he rather likes doing interviews. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t answer questions any more,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why Farage has done so well. He says what he thinks. When I was campaigning against Boris [to be mayor], one of the things that always amazed me was that he always said what people wanted to hear, whatever the audience.\u201d At whose feet does he lay this trend for half-truths and empty platitudes? Apparently, for this as for so much else, we can blame New Labour: \u201cIt\u2019s the legacy of the Blair era. You tell people what they want to hear.\u201d Livingstone thinks those polls that suggest more people would now vote Remain than Leave are correct, but that this can be put down to the business community rather than politicians: \u201cThe worries of business have got across to people.\u201d If he was a Labour MP in a Leave constituency, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cPeople were lied to. If I was an MP, I would be campaigning to say: this was a mistake. We must remain or you will lose your jobs. I suppose they worry that the party will be decimated if they do, but I can\u2019t see the point unless you say what you believe. Only eccentrics like Kate Hoey [the MP for Vauxhall] and John Mann [the MP for Bassetlaw] voted Leave. Everyone else knew how bad it would be for the economy.\u201d Has he said any of this to Corbyn and McDonnell? \u201cThey don\u2019t need my advice. But if they asked, I would tell them.\u201d His greatest regret \u2013 the only regret he is willing to admit to me \u2013 is that he didn\u2019t return to parliament after losing to Boris Johnson for the second time in 2012 (Livingstone was the MP for Brent East from 1987 to 2001) and so won\u2019t be available to join their cabinet. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have ever disagreed about economic issues,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I say, Labour is going to come out in favour of Remain, whether by means of an election or a second referendum. The real issue isn\u2019t the EU. The real issue is that Cameron and May make Thatcher look like a progressive liberal. They have made cuts she would never had dared to. Would she have cut 22,000 police? No, it\u2019s inconceivable.\u201d The way forward is, he thinks, perfectly obvious. \u201cWe do not need to increase taxes on ordinary people to rebuild our state. We just need to stop the super-rich and the corporations that pay no bloody tax. If we make them pay their share, we\u2019ll have all the money we need.\u201d But there may be other reasons why no one asks his advice just lately. Livingstone is not currently a member of the Labour party, having resigned his membership last year because he did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d following allegations of antisemitism made against him (until then, he had been fighting disciplinary action that followed after he told the BBC in 2016 that in 1932 Hitler had championed Jewish emigration to Israel and was \u201csupporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d). Does he feel sad about this? \u201cOf course. But the trouble is that when Jeremy became leader the disciplinary unit was stuffed with Blairites, who hate lefties like me. They dragged it out for two years and were clearly planning to drag it out for more. I was just being used to undermine Jeremy.\u201d Hmm. I\u2019m not sure I buy this argument, if only because the party expelled Alastair Campbell so quickly \u2013 and simply for having admitted, after the election, that he had not voted Labour (it took them about two seconds). But he\u2019s not to be put off. \u201cThe rules are clear. You can\u2019t support other parties and stay in the Labour party.\u201d Why, then, has no one disciplined his old friend Kate Hoey, who likes to be photographed cosying up to Nigel Farage? He laughs. \u201cI know. When she was a Marxist, I completely agreed with her. But she has bizarre views now.\u201d Still, he\u2019s hopeful that the issue of antisemitism in the party will soon be resolved. To my amazement, he is utterly \u201cdelighted\u201d that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission is formally to investigate whether Labour has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish, an inquiry announced last month after it received a number of complaints of antisemitism in the party. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he says, banging the table so that his coffee cup rattles. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to do a fair investigation, they\u2019re going to find that about 250 members have been found to have tweeted something antisemitic, that about 100 are still under investigation, and that this is about 0.08% of our members.\u201d Even better, the investigation will give him the chance to clear his name, to prove once and for all that journalists have wilfully misquoted him and that he never said Hitler was a Zionist (he did, however, unquestionably say that Hitler supported Zionism). \u201cI\u2019m writing to them. I assume they will want to question me.\u201d What follows, in this part of our conversation, is dispiriting, to put it mildly (and from a man, too, who will later tell me that he has just finished reading Simon Schama\u2019s \u201cquite remarkable\u201d The Story of the Jews). When I ask him about the experiences of Luciana Berger, the Jewish former Labour MP who required police protection during last year\u2019s Labour party conference, he says only that the abuse she gets \u201con the internet\u201d comes not from party members, but \u201cfrom bigots\u201d (she would doubtless disagree, given the behaviour of some members of her local party). When I ask if he doesn\u2019t see the point made by Margaret Hodge, another Jewish Labour MP, when she notes that the mere fact of the EHRC investigation brings shame on the party, he will respond only off the record. When I ask if some Labour activists don\u2019t wilfully and perniciously conflate Judaism and Zionism, he talks for some while about Ben Gurion, Benjamin Netanyahu and a book called The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, after which he insists that he wouldn\u2019t know what people say online \u201cbecause I\u2019ve never been on the internet in my life\u201d. In more than 50 years in the Labour party, he never saw or heard anything antisemitic. \u201cIf you\u2019re antisemitic, you\u2019re not going to join the Labour party, are you?\u201d And why\u2019s that? \u201cBecause the most prominent Jewish MPs are Labour MPs.\u201d The allegations against both himself and the Labour party are not upsetting to him, first because he has had \u201c38 years of lies and smears\u201d and, second, because he knows they\u2019re the invention of the media. \u201cYou plough through these stories and there\u2019s almost no examples [of antisemitic abuse].\u201d Livingstone was born in 1945, into a world in which things seemed always to be getting better: \u201cthe luckiest generation of Londoners in history\u201d, as he puts it in his book. Thanks to the Labour government\u2019s commitment to housebuilding, when he was five, his family was able to swap its tiny south London council flat, which had no bathroom, for one with hot water and a bedroom each for him and his sister. His dad, a former merchant seaman turned window cleaner, and his mum, a former music hall dancer, were Tories, but they were socially liberal and not, for the times, particularly strict and their son wonders now if this didn\u2019t have to do with the fact that they were more interested in each other than in their children. \u201cThey were passionately committed to each other and didn\u2019t plan to have kids. They met when Mum was dancing and Dad and his mates were hanging about at the stage door. They went for fish and chips afterwards and by the end of the evening, they knew it was the relationship of their life. The fourth time they met, it was their wedding.\u201d He sounds a little awestruck. Does he find this romantic? \u201cNo, I just wish it had happened to me.\u201d In his book, which is part memoir and part guide (there is a wholechapter devoted to restaurants, about which he used to write for the Evening Standard, and in which he reveals that his favourite chippy is the Nautilus in Fortune Green, and that it was the Birds of a Feather star Lesley Joseph who introduced him to pink champagne when they ate at the Ivy), Livingstone makes a lot of his hardscrabble beginnings: one pair of socks and one pair of pants used to have to last all week, or so he says. But it wasn\u2019t really his family\u2019s relative lack of wealth that influenced his politics (in any case, his parents went on to buy their own home in West Norwood). Nor was it his sense of being different, though different was undoubtedly how he felt. \u201cI almost died of gastroenteritis when I was two,\u201d he says. \u201cI was physically three years behind everyone else, the smallest, runtiest kid. I couldn\u2019t climb the bars in the gym; I used to come joint last with a fat boy in running races. I was weak and nerdy. I was the last kid in my year to get pubic hair.\u201d So what was it, then? What turned him leftwards? \u201cIt was just about doing things. That\u2019s why people went into politics then, on both sides: to get things done, not to be a bloody celebrity.\u201d John Major, he reminds me, was, just like himself, on Lambeth Council\u2019s housing committee as a young councillor: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that Tory leaders then had fought side by side with working-class men in the war, whereas the political elite now haven\u2019t had any contact with working-class people. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so unrepresentative.\u201d His father worried about him, this boy who was obsessed with astronomy and amphibians and who never seemed to have a girlfriend (women, he says, found neither his face nor his \u201cboring voice\u201d attractive; he was 21 before he drunkenly lost his virginity). But it was a time of full employment and when he left school, like every boy in his class, he soon found a job, in his case, working as an animal technician at the Royal Marsden cancer research unit. And then there was politics. Livingstone joined the Labour party in 1968 when everyone else seemed to be leaving it and as a result, in the 70s, he rose swiftly and smoothly through the ranks, first as a councillor and later on the Greater London Council, which he would eventually lead. He was always a controversial figure. His support for gay rights, he says, led to one report in the press suggesting he was importing pills from San Francisco that caused semen to be strawberry flavoured. But he has just as often been vindicated. The London congestion charge, which he brought in as mayor, has, for instance, been copied by other cities and towns and no future politician would ever think of rolling it back now. Does he miss running the city? \u201cYes, I loved it.\u201d Is there anything he wishes he had done differently? Seemingly unable to understand the question \u2013 though I rephrase it a couple of times \u2013 he launches into a list of his achievements, from enabling planning permission for the Shard, the capital\u2019s tallest building, to the revamping of the city\u2019s overground train services. Of course, the first time he stood to be mayor in 2000, it was as an independent against Labour\u2019s official candidate, Frank Dobson. Blair would rather have had just about anyone other than him in the job, including (according to Livingstone) Delia Smith. What does Livingstone think of Blair now? Has time softened the edges off their enmity? \u201cThe problem with Tony was that he was very talented and bright, but in his years at Oxford, he never went to any political event. He was into acting and music.\u201d I laugh a bit at this, because to almost anyone else, this might be seen as a plus: a politician with a hinterland and thus, perhaps, a sense of perspective. But Livingstone continues smoothly on. \u201cHe had to join Labour or Cherie wouldn\u2019t have married him, so he comes into politics with no background or understanding and he reads all this crap about how I\u2019m a Soviet agent.\u201d Is Corbyn\u2019s Labour party too apt to forget the achievements of New Labour? \u201cWell, he will keep the policies on race and sexuality. But they didn\u2019t restructure the economy. That\u2019s the damning indictment.\u201d Livingstone has five children: teenagers with his wife, Emma Beal, whom he married in 2009, and three older children, two girls and a boy, whose existence only became public during the 2008 mayoral election campaign (in a memoir he published in 2011, he revealed, oh-so-casually, that he had agreed to help out their mothers, friends of his who both feared they might miss their chance to have children; at the time, he was still with Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK director and the partner with whom he spent 20 years before he met Beal). Are his children Corbynites? What do they make of their father\u2019s politics? \u201cMy children are not into politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe three older ones are in their late 20s. They saw what I had to put up with and that\u2019s not going to encourage you. But they\u2019re all progressive: my older girls [Georgia and Lottie] work in the NHS; one is a midwife and one works in administration. Liam runs a website. Tom [his son with Beal] spends all day on the computer and Mia shops with her friends. She wants to be a marine biologist.\u201d Are they proud of their father? He replies by answering a question I haven\u2019t yet asked. \u201cWe all go out for meals together regularly and we get on well.\u201d Is it true that they all used to go on holiday together? \u201cYes, it is.\u201d You\u2019re the great paterfamilias, I say. \u201cWell, look how old I am with kids in their early teens. It\u2019s unusual. But they keep me young. That and walking the dog.\u201d Does he believe his political career is over now? \u201cTom and Mia are 15 and 16. They don\u2019t need me hanging around any more. So I\u2019m going to get much more involved in environmental campaigning, because I\u2019m pessimistic: I believe there\u2019s a real possibility of extinction by the end of the century.\u201d Are there still newts in the pond in his north London garden? \u201cThere are, but the tragedy is that 10 years ago in the springtime, there would be a dozen frogs laying spawn and now there are none. The population has collapsed and there are very few newts, too, comparatively. It used to be heaving with amphibians! We are destroying the planet. When I was a boy, we assumed we\u2019d go to Mars. But we know now that\u2019s too expensive and there\u2019s deadly radiation. We evolved to live on this planet \u2013 look how astronauts are when they spend six months at the space station. They can hardly walk. So we can\u2019t just spread out across the universe. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Talking of newts and far-off planets, he looks, and sounds, highly animated. Nevertheless, in his heart ambition and perhaps even (whisper it) regret are, I think, still swirling around in such a way as to put a bit of a crimp on a man\u2019s retirement. \u201cIf the Labour party was to bring me back in, it would be all screaming about antisemitism,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Jeremy has the chance now to run the best government since 1945.\u201d So he would like a job? His gaze shifts beyond my shoulder. \u201cI would do\u2026 anything.\u201d Book extract: Livingstone\u2019s London by Ken Livingstone I had no option but to stand as an independent for mayor, and won a convincing majority on 4 May 2000. The first words I said after the result was announced were: \u201cAs I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago.\u201d The Daily Mail warned: \u201cLeftwing extremist Ken Livingstone seizes control.\u201d The Daily Telegraph said: \u201cLivingstone represents the Beckhamisation of politics.\u201d The Independent on Sunday warned \u201cKen has his eyes on No 10\u201d and the Sunday Telegraph said I was not up to the job. The Times claimed: \u201cPutin is said to be an admirer.\u201d Oddly enough, Margaret Thatcher came up to me at an event and said: \u201cStick to your guns: everyone will be trying to tell you to do something else, but you must keep your resolve. You\u2019re now the leader of the equivalent of a small nation. Resolute, that\u2019s what you must be, resolute.\u201d This struck me as a bit odd, given just 15 years previously she was comparing me to a communist dictator, but the mood on the streets was amazing, with everyone shaking my hand and slapping me on the back. After the vote was analysed it turned out that I had got the support of 46% of Labour voters, 33% of Lib Dems and, bizarrely, 24% of Tories. As leader of the GLC I had been managing the 47 other Labour members, but the American mayoral system, which is used at City Hall, is completely different. You\u2019re the chief executive of the whole machine and every decision is made by you. Just 10 days after the election I was completely knackered and woke up one morning to find my leg swollen. My GP thought it was thrombosis and whisked me off to hospital. Fortunately it turned out to be a Baker\u2019s cyst caused by my spending too long on my knees gardening. One of the most important things was to clamp down on the way the bus companies were ripping London off. Back in my GLC days, tube and bus drivers earned the same, but after bus privatisation bus drivers\u2019 wages had been slashed to just \u00a316,000 a year, compared to the tube drivers on \u00a325,000. Having organised a wage increase for the bus drivers, I couldn\u2019t get on a bus without the driver congratulating me. A lot of people were amazed when I appointed to run Transport for London the American Bob Kiley, who had joined the CIA in 1963 and ended up as executive assistant to CIA director Richard Helms, who had been given a suspended prison sentence for lying to Congress and covering up assassinations. But Bob and I hit it off immediately and I was delighted to discover that he had spent a lot of his time driving Robert Kennedy to election rallies in his campaign to be president in 1968. Although everyone thought I wouldn\u2019t get on with the head of London\u2019s police, both Sir John Stevens and his deputy, Ian Blair, had a great working relationship with me. Towards the end of my first year in office, I was with Sir John at a police officers\u2019 annual dinner when he got word that there had been a fire in my office. Fearing this might be a deliberate attempt on my life, Sir John sent armed police to my home. Sitting in the car with Sir John, his protection officer asked me: \u201cCan you think of anybody who might have a grudge against you?\u201d I laughed and said: \u201cHow long have you got?\u201d \u2022 Livingstone\u2019s London is published by Muswell Press (\u00a38.99).
