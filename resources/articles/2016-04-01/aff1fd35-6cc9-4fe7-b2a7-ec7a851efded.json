At the end of a three-day visit during which he celebrated the Queen\u2019s 90th birthday with a lunch at Windsor Castle, Obama said it was wrong for Brexit campaigners to suggest it would be straightforward to agree a new trade relationship if Britain left the EU. \u201cIt could be five years from now, 10 years from now before we\u2019re actually able to get something done,\u201d he told the BBC, adding that the first priority for the US would be to complete ongoing talks on a trade deal with the EU. Obama defended his right to express an opinion, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate that anything I\u2019ve said will change the position of those who are leading the campaigns in one direction or the other, but for ordinary voters I thought it would be relevant to hear what the president of the United States, who loves the British people and cares deeply about this relationship, has to say.\u201d The president\u2019s comments came as Theresa May prepared to give a speech outlining \u201cthe rights and wrongs, the opportunities and risks\u201d of EU membership. The home secretary, who has played a relatively low-key role in the remain campaign, will say on Monday: \u201cI think it\u2019s right for Britain to remain a European Union member precisely because I believe in Britain\u2019s strength, in our economic, diplomatic and military clout, because I am optimistic about our future, and because I believe in our ability to lead and not just follow.\u201d May will argue that there are both positives and negatives to Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, but will say: \u201cI believe it is clearly in our national interest to remain a member.\u201d Meanwhile, the London mayor, Boris Johnson, used his latest Telegraph column to attack David Cameron for achieving \u201ctwo thirds of diddly squat\u201d in his pre-referendum negotiations with Brussels. \u201cSo I gather they think it\u2019s game over. The Bremainers think they have bombed us into submission \u2026 they are crowing too soon,\u201d he writes. Johnson was slapped down by Obama during his UK visit after claiming the president nurtured an \u201cancestral dislike of the British empire\u201d because he was \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d. The backlash against Johnson\u2019s remarks continued, with students at King\u2019s College London withdrawing a speaking invitation to him, citing his \u201cinappropriate comments and inferences towards President Obama\u2019s Kenyan heritage, of which he is rightly proud.\u201d As the president boarded Air Force One to fly to Germany for a summit with other European powers in Hanover on Monday, the leave campaign appeared to have been thrown into disarray. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, told Sky News that Vote Leave, the official Brexit campaign, was at risk of losing the argument by relying too heavily on cabinet ministers wielding statistics, instead of allowing alternative voices to be heard. \u201cIt appears that the leave campaign is just the Conservative cabinet ministers,\u201d he said. \u201cI think to win this referendum you\u2019ve got to see trade union voices, you\u2019ve got to see Labour voices, you\u2019ve got to see Ukip voices \u2013 we\u2019ve got to be appealing to a broader group of people than just the Tory electorate.\u201d Farage said leave campaigners should focus more on the issue of immigration, instead of the economics of the EU. \u201cIf we debate economics and trade, we can go round in circles for weeks and the public will be none the wiser,\u201d he said. It appeared that peace had broken out on the leave side last week when Farage, whose Grassroots Out campaign failed in its bid to be declared the official leave campaign, shared a platform with the pro-Brexit minister Chris Grayling. But Farage said it was time for a fresh start after a shaky week in which Vote Leave\u2019s campaign director Dominic Cummings endured a tough grilling from MPs and Johnson was slapped down by Obama. Meanwhile, it emerged that Gisela Stuart, the co-chair of Vote Leave, had written to the home secretary urging May to exclude the rightwing French politician Marine Le Pen, who plans to come to Britain to make the case for Brexit. Amid fears that the arrival of the leader of the Front National to bat for Brexit would damn Vote Leave by association, Stuart said Le Pen had made \u201cmany divisive and inflammatory comments, including comparing Muslims praying in the street to the Nazi occupation of France\u201d. Dominic Raab, the pro-leave junior minister, also said he hoped Le Pen would stay away. The home secretary sought to neutralise the issue of immigration, insisting that it would still be difficult to control whether Britain remained a member of the EU or opted to leave. \u201cYes, free movement makes it harder to control immigration but it doesn\u2019t make it impossible to control immigration,\u201d May told the BBC. She said controlling immigration whether from inside or outside the EU was hard. \u201cWe have constantly to be working at it, which is exactly what we\u2019re doing, so you can\u2019t just change one feature and assume that is going to have an impact.\u201d Leading leave campaigner Michael Gove, the justice secretary, warned that Britain would be subject to a migration \u201cfree-for-all\u201d by the addition of countries including Albania and Turkey to the EU. He wrote in an article in the Times that their accession posed a \u201cdirect and serious threat\u201d to public services and living standards in the UK. Raab, a justice minister, was forced to concede that if Britain left the EU, holidaymakers travelling to other EU countries might have to apply for visas. \u201cI think we\u2019d have to look at that as part of the negotiations in detail. But I think, look, at the moment President Obama\u2019s administration \u2026 is looking at new visa requirements and screening from Germany, Belgium, Greece, France, because of the recent terrorist attacks. I think we should at least have the power and the control to do that and make sure we keep Britain safe.\u201d Asked whether this could mean British citizens would need visas to go to France or Germany, Raab said: \u201cOr some other kind of check.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
