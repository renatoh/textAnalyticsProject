The fans shouted obscenities and hammered on the tinted windows of the Manchester United midfielder's car as it left the ground. Beckham, who was with his wife and parents, has denied allegations that he spat in the face of a fan. Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chief executive, said: \"It's just not an easy situation where there's a car which is easily identifiable.It's unfortunate that in this day and age there is always somebody ready to have a go. \"We would not want to have the same protection for sportsman as we do have for presidents, but it is a difficult one. We may have to camouflage coaches and camouflage cars so that people have no idea who is in them, but I believe that would be a sad reflection on how bad things have got.\" United's director of communications Paddy Harverson said: \"The club considers the safety and security of the players of paramount importance. We always do our utmost to make sure they are escorted when they arrive and leave the ground.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
