Asked why he took off Trevor Leota five minutes before the break, the former All Black hooker gave a reply that would burn a cauliflower ear. \"Because he was crap - and so was his replacement. It wasn't just their poor throwing into the lineout. They lost their discipline and they let their team-mates down,\" was the Wasps coach's blunt assessment. Leota could probably be forgiven for being distracted by the controversy over his decision to play for his club rather than join Samoa's World Cup squad. But Gatland's frustration will probably make the hooker wish he was on the other side of the world this week. Wasps lost nine of their lineouts, unforgivable nowadays, while Leota conceded a penalty for a first-half stamping and his replacement Jonny Barrett was sent to the sin-bin for killing the ball. As in the defeat at Harlequins a fortnight earlier, Wasps' discipline let them down after they had dominated in the early stages. Two defeats do not scupper the champions' chances of retaining their title next spring but, while raw forwards like Barrett and the new No8 John Hart are being thrown in at the deep end, they badly lack leadership in the absence of Lawrence Dallaglio. Will Green and, more importantly, the former England hooker Phil Greening, should return to bolster the front row for Sunday's must-win visit of unbeaten Bath. Northampton won because, in the words of their coach, another former All Black Wayne Smith, they \"showed character\". The Saints were anxious to make an impression in their first home game on a pitch that resembled a snooker table. But the team, tipped by many to take their first title, took a while to get into the frame. Ten points down after a quarter of an hour, they needed the boot of the fly-half Shane Drahm to keep them in touch. Drahm, an Australian rescued from the wreckage of Bristol's ill-fated venture into professional rugby, kicked 17 points and provided one of the more memorable moments of a tension-packed match. After 26 minutes he hoisted a kick to the corner which was gathered by his left-wing Bruce Reihana who stepped inside Shane Roiser for a splendid try. It was one of the few glimpses of the line allowed the Saints, their other try coming deep into injury-time when the 19-year-old debutant John Clarke intercepted a pass from Tom Voyce to secure victory. Clarke's debut had been in doubt until the eve of the game as he had suffered from flu all week but he is one of a number of young players eagerly seizing their first-team opportunities. Clarke's work was mostly confined to defensive duties but he could do nothing to prevent two cracking tries from Wasps, both engineered by midfield breaks by Mark van Gisbergen and Ayoola Erinle and finished off by the impressive Irish flanker Johnny O'Connor and the abrasive scrum-half Peter Richards. Drahm collected the man-of-the-match award and looks as if he could be doing more than just keeping Paul Grayson's fly-half seat warm. An Australia A international he wants to be considered for England when his residency period ends next year. \"I'm a proud Australian but who wouldn't want to play for the best team in the world?\" he said. Drahm's was not the best match of the day. In the crowd a Saints fan accepted a marriage proposal. The champions, however, are not enjoying much of a honeymoon.
