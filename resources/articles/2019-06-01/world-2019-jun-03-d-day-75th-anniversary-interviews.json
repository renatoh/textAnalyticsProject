Senior politicians and members of the royal family as well as hundreds of veterans will attend ceremonies to mark one of the main turning points of the second world war and the biggest amphibious invasion in military history. More than 200 veterans have boarded a cruise ship, MV Boudicca, charted by the Royal British Legion, to attend the events, while others are descending en masse on Portsmouth and Normandy. Here we hear the stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week\u2019s commemorations. Prisoner of war: \u201cI looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up\u201d Percy Lewis, 96, a wireless operator with No 6 Beach Group, spent most of D-day sheltering in the sand dunes off Sword beach. After landing at 11am on a small landing craft, he had to wait for the rest of his battalion to come. \u201cNow and again there were a few shells coming over, but all the infantry and tanks had gone,\u201d he said. The remainder of the second world war, however, would not prove so straightforward for him. In the first week in July, while posted with 1st Battalion Black Watch, \u201cgoing up towards Rouen and having not seen \u2018Jerry\u2019 [a nickname given to Germans during the war] for two days\u201d, he and his comrades dug in. As he set up his wireless near a barn, \u201cJerry started mortaring, and I got shrapnel in the left ankle. It was only a flesh wound, but it was blood everywhere.\u201d Lewis, from Guildford, was evacuated and treated in Staffordshire before returning, this time to the Netherlands. In October 1944, while advancing through the country, his platoon found themselves at night in a small village \u201csomewhere in the Venray area\u201d and occupied the crossroads. But he had to retrace his steps to retrieve some wireless equipment. \u201cI started walking back alone, rifle over my shoulder, and the moon had just come up behind my back. I got a fair way back. Someone shouted: \u2018Halt.\u2019 I said: \u2018Friend.\u2019 Nothing. I walked a bit further. \u2018Halt.\u2019 I said: \u2018Friend.\u2019 Nothing. I took the rifle off my shoulder. \u201cThere was a row of cottages. A door was open. I thought: \u2018I\u2019ll make for that door.\u2019 And just as I got to the door, Jerry stepped out with his rifle on me. I looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up. Two German paratroopers about two doors away pushed me into the middle of the road. \u201cI thought: \u2018They\u2019ll start shooting in a minute.\u2019 Nothing happened. They took me round the corner, and down into the cellar. And it was full of German paratroopers cleaning all their kit.\u201d With a rifle pushed into his back, he was handed over to a Panzer division. He was now a prisoner of war, and would be interned in the Stalag XI-B Fallingbostel PoW camp in Germany. It was liberated in April 1945. \u201cEleven of us go to Normandy, to Arromanches, every year,\u201d said Lewis, who has regularly given the exhortation on the seafront during the annual commemorations. Sunk and stranded: \u201cI helped lay three of them out\u201d Ron Smith, 94, an electrician (then known as a wireman) from Rustington, West Sussex, was on landing craft tank (LCT) 947, which approached Sword beach at 7.35am on D-day. As troops disembarked, a shell hit one of the tanks on the landing craft, immobilising it and blocking the craft\u2019s exit ramp. Torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing the colonel on board and three others. Smith helped wrap up the bodies, as the LCT was forced to retreat and make its way back to Portsmouth. \u201cI helped to lay three of them out,\u201d he said. One was Lt Col Arthur Cocks, the first British officer killed in the landings. \u201cHe\u2019s now celebrated in Portsmouth Cathedral with a window,\u201d said Smith. On their final briefings, he said: \u201cWe were told we were going to France, \u2018and you won\u2019t need a passport\u2019.\u201d But nothing could really prepare for the beach landings. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon a winkle survived on that beach. It was just one heap of explosives \u2013 it was amazing the way the tanks went off. \u201cAs soon as we landed, our role was to clear off quickly so the next could come in.\u201d But after the LCT was hit, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t land anything else\u201d. He spent a week in Portsmouth as the LCT was repaired, then headed back to Normandy. But the LCT hit a mine off the coast of Arromanches, near the Mulberry harbour. The crew managed to swim to a nearby merchant ship, which had been deliberately half-sunk to provide defence for the artificial harbour. \u201cWe went up a rope, up three steps, and were over the gunnel on to the deck. Then we went to the wheelhouse. And the only thing we rescued was a huge jar of rum. And we drunk the lot,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThere were 12 of us, and we were on there for 14 hours. \u201cEveryone was too busy to rescue us. We had to just stop on there. Eventually a landing craft came alongside and we were off. We were taken to an army camp, and they served us with half a loaf of bread and soup you could stand a spoon up in, and it was the best meal I\u2019ve ever tasted. Amazing.\u201d Smith was then dispatched to the UK, where he recovered from his injuries in a hospital in Scotland. He was later sent to Burma. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time ago. This is the most I ever talk about it. I was only 19, that\u2019s all I was,\u201d he said. Switchboard operator: \u201cI could hear very loud, sustained gunfire\u201d Marie Scott, 92, a switchboard operator, volunteered for the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) at 17. She was posted to the labyrinthine Fort Southwick, the underground Combined Operations Underground HQ, and the nerve centre on D-day, which was run from tunnels deep in the cliffs overlooking Portsmouth. On D-day, her job was as a very high frequency (VHF) radio operator, relaying messages to and from the invasion fleet and landing troops. \u201cIt was a series of tunnels. Quite spartan,\u201d she said of Fort Southwick. \u201cThe tunnels were very deep. We had to go down about 350 steps to get into the tunnels and, indeed, come up 350 steps. But at 17 you could do it. \u201cWe had long shifts, so we had to sleep down there as well. There was no natural light. There was no fresh air. So we had air conditioning and electric lights. On and off I was down there certainly for six to nine months, over D-day and after D-day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew something big was afoot because there was an armada of boats in Portsmouth harbour. That was a giveaway. \u201cThe VHF radio was a one-way system. When you raised your lever to transmit, the recipient couldn\u2019t make any interjections until you had finished, and said: \u2018Roger and out.\u2019 or whatever. Then they would raise their lever, and transmit their message\u201d. On D-day she was in direct contact with the wireless operators on the allied invasion fleet as they stormed the beaches. \u201cWhen they raised their lever, I could hear very loud, sustained gunfire. It was really so bad that you thought: \u2018Oh my God. There\u2019s a battle going on.\u2019 You knew. You thought: \u2018God, men are dying.\u2019 The reality suddenly hit you. For a rather naive 17-year-old, I think it was terrifying. But it was a job. You got on with it. \u201cThe messages were all in code, so you didn\u2019t know what was being said. But you could hear the gunfire, every time the lever was lifted. I\u2019ve never forgotten what I heard. Never.\u201d On the 75th anniversary, Scott, from New Malden, Surrey, will be in Normandy, travelling as a guest of the Taxi Charity, that annually takes veterans to Normandy. This year more than 30 taxis will be involved. It will be a special moment for Scott, who after the war became a secretary, married, raised a family and then worked for Surrey county council. She has been awarded the Legion D\u2019Honneur by the French, which will be presented by a French general at a ceremony at the Pegasus museum in Ranville. \u201cI\u2019m deeply honoured, and very humbled. You feel that you can\u2019t be deserving because men laid down their lives. We were the backroom people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, really. And it\u2019s going to be fantastic. \u201cAll that really concerns me is that somebody will be available \u2013 hopefully a strapping young soldier or sailor or airman \u2013 to help me up the steps!\u201d Seasickness: \u201cPlease let us get over there and get off this thing\u201d Mick Jennings, 93, served as an electrician on LCT 795 to carry troops of the US 531 Engineer Shore Regiment on to Utah beach on D-day. They landed under German shellfire and the craft was beached, leaving personnel open to attack. \u201cIt was a very rough crossing. I\u2019m afraid the American troops weren\u2019t used to being on that sort of thing [the LCT] and so a lot of them were very sick. Their only concern was: \u2018Please let us get over there and get off this thing,\u2019\u201d he said. He saw one LCT break up. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really meant for that sort of sea,\u201d said Jennings, from Emsworth, near Chichester. \u201cApparently, we landed on the wrong side of the beach. It should have been further left, I think, but we didn\u2019t know it at the time. I can still see it. It\u2019s like a cin\u00e9 film. I can see us coming in and thinking: \u2018Well, there were mines on the beach.\u2019 There were all sorts there. Luckily, the tide took us and we landed on a reasonably safe beach.\u201d His abiding memory was wishing \u201cjust to get back, to be honest\u201d. Jennings said: \u201cI\u2019m just one of thousands who was doing the job you were trained for. I\u2019m nothing special.\u201d He continued to ferry troops back and forth across the Channel during the liberation. Victory didn\u2019t come cheap: \u201cI had just my achilles holding my foot on\u201d Bill Gladden, 95, who was in the 6th Airborne Armoured Recce Regiment, was 20 years old when he took off from a Dorset airfield on D-day in a Hamilcar glider, which dwarfed the Halifax towing it. It was the first time tanks had been flown into a battlefield, and he was squashed alongside one tank and six motorbikes, weighing a total of 16 tonnes. As they crossed the Channel he climbed on top of the tank to look out of a porthole. But then, suddenly, the towrope dropped. \u201cI felt the towrope go, because once it drops it\u2019s like you hit a brick wall. I couldn\u2019t move, I just hung on, and that\u2019s how I landed in Normandy, spread-eagled on top of a Tetrarch tank.\u201d Their job was to quickly make their way to Ranville Bridge over the Orne, taken earlier in the day, and hold it. He spent his first night in Normandy dug in there, then he moved to an orchard at Ranville. His stay would be brief. \u201cEach day we went out, pretty deep into the countryside, to find out where the Germans were and report back,\u201d said Gladden. \u201cWe got chased back a few times. \u201cI\u2019d been there about 12 days. We could hear the Germans start up their tanks of a morning. And, although we used to go out quite a bit, the fighting went on in the Ranville area for a long time.\u201d On 18 June he came back from patrol as usual. \u201cAnd I was just about to pour the water out and have a brew up when suddenly there was a bang, and I was on my back.\u201d A German Tiger tank had fired on the group. The whole of the front of his ankle was blown off. \u201cI had just my Achilles holding my foot on,\u201d he said. Colleagues carried him to an old barn used to treat casualties. Two days earlier, Gladden had helped carry the bodies of two friends to the same barn. \u201cLittle did I know that within the next two days they would be carrying me over. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pain at first. When the pain comes on, they start pushing the old morphine into you. And then you sail away.\u201d He remembers coming to a field hospital. Doctors were struggling to save his foot. \u201c\u2018Amputation considered\u2019: that was on the ticket I read around my neck when I came to, lying on a stretcher on the grass being sick as a dog.\u201d Gladden was evacuated to the UK. He spent the following three years in hospital, with his foot only finally being saved by a sophisticated bone graft involving both his legs being temporarily sewn and plastered together. His foot has troubled him ever since. The injury meant he was discharged from the army on medical grounds. \u201cI count myself very lucky,\u201d said Gladden, from Welling, Kent, who went on to work in the accounts department at Siemens. \u201cI survived, thousands didn\u2019t.\u201d He has returned to Ranville 10 times during recent years, since becoming a widower, and was heading there again for the 75th anniversary of D-day as a guest of the Taxi Charity. \u201cIt\u2019s a nostalgic visit. And it is nice to get thanks from the people out there. But I think the main thing is to keep alive the fact that victory didn\u2019t come cheap. \u201cThere were thousands of young men who were killed and maimed in those first few days, and we just don\u2019t want any more wars. That\u2019s the way I look at it.\u201d Get off this bloody beach: \u201cLooking at the bodies, you felt sorry about it\u201d Before the 75th commemorations, seven surviving veterans from the Battle of Normandy and D-day were honoured at an event at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Chelsea pensioner Bill Fitzgerald, 94, who served with the Sussex regiment and was only 18 at the time, said: \u201cWe were the third in on the day. We got so far in and then we hit something underneath, so we knew we were going to get wet. \u201cThe beach master was there shouting out: \u2018Get off this bloody beach and don\u2019t get killed.\u2019 \u201cThe water was full of bodies and they were mostly all Marine Commandos \u2013 but you couldn\u2019t take too much notice, all you were thinking of was helping each other,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking at the bodies, you felt sorry about it, but you had a job to get on that beach and wait for your friends.\u201d He was injured nine days after D-day in a shelling on 15 June. \u201cWe had a horrible day fighting and the tanks decided to stop in the woods,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, they shelled the hell out of us. \u201cAll I can remember is getting a shell very near me, going up in the air and coming down and one of my friends putting a helmet over my face,\u201d he said, speaking at the Royal Hospital Chelsea last month. His femur was broken in half and he was flown back to the UK on 17 June. \u201cAfter I was discharged, I got my suit, I got my hat, and you\u2019re outside the door saying: \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d Bomb disposal: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the landing was very gory\u201d Chelsea pensioner Frank Mouqu\u00e9, 94, was a corporal in the Royal Engineers who landed on Sword beach and whose job was to dispose of bombs on a stretch of land beyond the parapet next to the beach. \u201cWe approached Sword beach in a landing craft. We had all of our gear on our backs and a rubber ring around our stomach to help keep us afloat. Let\u2019s face it, the landing was very gory. You didn\u2019t have time to think, survival instinct kicked in,\u201d he said in his account published on the Royal Hospital Chelsea\u2019s website. \u201cAfter reaching the beach, I ran up towards a parapet, and searched for mines. After 12 hours of being on the go we were exhausted and then had to dig a foxhole to sleep in. We had to dig six foot down and two foot wide. \u201cI slept outside for the next year or so, we had no protection from the elements. We had an oversized gas cape to go over our clothes and all our gear. We rarely slept lying down. Each time we slept in a barn we were ravaged by fleas \u2013 so even that was no good. \u201cIt was a different time: I wasn\u2019t a hero, I was a little cog in a big wheel. When you add all those little cogs together \u2013 then we became important. We all worked together towards peace.\u201d Born on D-day: \u201cIt isn\u2019t my wish that you remain a widow\u201d Alan Gaudern was born on D-day in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. His father, William, a teacher, would never see him. Serving in Normandy with the Somerset Light Infantry, William was killed on 10 July 1944 at the age of 37. Alan \u2013 who has visited Normandy, in particular Hill 112 west of Caen, which his father fought to recapture, and Bayeux war cemetery, where he is buried \u2013 has retained his last letters written from the front. The letters, read by Alan, form part of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\u2019s Voices of Liberation audio archive. During the 75th anniversary commemorations at Portsmouth and Bayeux, there will be installations where the public can listen to many of those voices. William and his wife, Ethel, already had a daughter, Joyce, aged four, when Alan was born. \u201cAlan William was born on 6 June at Harrogate hospital. Ethel and he are both doing well, from what I hear,\u201d William wrote to family friends. \u201cI haven\u2019t see my son and heir yet, so you can guess how much I am looking forward to my next leave. When that will be, I don\u2019t know.\u201d But it was not to be. William\u2019s last letter to Ethel was dated 18 June 1944. He was on the move, he said. \u201cIt is a lovely summer morning, so we should have as comfortable a trip as is possible. The countryside was perfect as we came along, so fresh and full of beauty,\u201d he wrote. He enclosed a \u00a35 cheque, sent to him at the front by his father. \u201cPlease cash it and spend it on yourself, on something you would really like. I shall look forward to hearing what it is, and later to seeing you wearing it,\u201d he wrote. The letter continues: \u201cYou know we\u2019ve faced up to the likelihood that I may not come back. But you know I feel I shall come back because I want to so much. We\u2019ve had a perfect married life together, haven\u2019t we?\u201d He adds: \u201cBut if I don\u2019t come back, I want you to know how much I owe to you and to thank you for our lovely life together. And to let you know that it isn\u2019t my wish that you remain a widow if you really fall in love again. I am happy in the knowledge that you\u2019ll bring up Joyce and Alan to be useful and good God-fearing citizens. If I don\u2019t come back, teach them as much nature study as you know, which is a great deal. \u201cI hope we can sit down one day and laugh at what I\u2019ve written. Wish me a happy landings and be a brave lass like you always are. You\u2019re not to worry or else the milk will go sour.\u201d Alan, a retired bank manager, and himself a father, said: \u201cMy mother was both mother and father to me and I think she did a good job with that. Yes, I felt as I look back that I would have wished to have a father as a male role model, which is so important. But my mother was an amazing woman. \u201cShe was left with a four-year-old and a six-week-old baby to fend for herself. People now don\u2019t realise how difficult it was for war widows. Yes, my mother got a war widow\u2019s pension, but that was taxable. Taxable! For a war widow.\u201d Bayeux cemetery: \u201cI feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations\u201d Three generations of William Moody\u2019s family have worked for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) in France. As supervisor of the sector that takes in Normandy, Moody, 67, has a responsibility for ensuring the Bayeux military cemetery, the largest British second world war cemetery in France, looks perfect for the 75th anniversary. There are 4,144 Commonwealth burials there, each one marked with a white headstone. Maintenance is ongoing throughout the year. Each headstone is cleaned. The turf is fertilised and cropped short to maintain its vivid green. Seasonal plantings include roses, designed to bloom in June on the anniversary. \u201cThe headstone is the identity of the soldier, with his badge, and his name and his regiment. So it\u2019s so important. You see old veterans, standing by the graves of perhaps a friend they lost. Sometimes they rest their hand on the headstone. This is their comrade, whom they lost in the landings. As I walk past, I keep very quiet, because they are honouring their comrades. They are here to see their friends. It\u2019s very emotional,\u201d said Moody. \u201cAnd the plantings, to me, it is as if each one has their own little garden, like they might have done back home, if they had lived. I am proud to be able to honour those that fell and to give them a place that seems like home, although they are sometimes so far from home. \u201cI feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations, ensuring that we can always come to these remarkable places to reflect on the courage, sacrifice and the real cost in human terms that these men and women made to preserve our freedom.\u201d Moody has worked for 52 years with the CWGC, starting as a pupil gardener. His father, who is from Aberystwyth in Wales, served with the Royal Signals, serving in India before coming to France after the Normandy landings and staying there to work for the CWGC in northern France. He has witnessed many anniversaries at Bayeux, and other CWGC cemeteries throughout Europe and north Africa. But it is the scale of the Bayeux commemorations he always finds so moving. \u201cI am always amazed when I see the veterans go past marching. They try to keep straight, they are soldiers still, and the pride is there. They walk straight, and some of them have difficulties walking, but they still do it, they try to march, and its a huge effort for them, but they want to show the public they are still there,\u201d he said. Weather: \u201cEisenhower was smoking five packs a day\u201d Col Jeremy Green (retired), is a historian and expert on Southwick House, the Allied HQ near Portsmouth, from where Gen \u201cIke\u201d Eisenhower made the decision to delay by one day. Green said initially there were huge differences between American and British and Norwegian meteorologists. And had Ike, the supreme allied commander, listened to his fellow Americans, D-day could have been a disaster. \u201cThe Americans came here with great enthusiasm based upon an analogue system of taking the weather by a guy called Irving Krick. He basically said if you look at historical weather patterns, and if those conditions are replicated again, the same weather would occur,\u201d said Green. \u201cAnd the problem for us, the Brits, was he was briefing Eisenhower direct.\u201d The American military initially refused to talk to the British chief meteorologist, James Stagg, \u201cbecause he was a civilian\u201d, until Stagg was temporarily made a group captain in the Royal Air Force. Stagg was receiving information from weather stations including, crucially, Blacksod Lighthouse in County Mayo, on Ireland\u2019s west coast. A huge depression rapidly moving into the Channel did not augur well for 5 June, the original planned day of the Normandy invasion, thought Stagg. Krick thought 5 June was \u201cgood to go\u201d. Ike was living on his nerves, \u201csmoking five packs of cigarettes a day, drinking too much coffee, eating little and sleeping less,\u201d said Green. With disagreements among the meteorologists, Stagg decided it fell to him to give an \u201cunequivocal and firm opinion on the deterioration of the weather\u201d. He told him 5 June would be overcast, stormy, with winds too strong to land troops, and cloud offering just 500ft-to-zero visibility. His words were greeted with silence, said Green. In the end, Eisenhower\u2019s decision rested on Stagg\u2019s opinion that there would be a brief \u201cinterlude\u201d on 6 June. Eisenhower made his fateful decision. His diary records that on what should have been invasion day he awoke in the early hours to find \u201cour little camp was shaking and shuddering under a wind of almost hurricane proportions and the accompanying rain seems to be travelling in horizontal streaks\u201d. Stagg had been right. If the invasion had started that morning, it would have failed. Hours later, at the morning meeting, he announced his decision. Trusting Stagg, once more, the invasion was on for 6 June. Naval commander: \u201cHistory may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme\u201d Commander Craig Wood, of the Portsmouth flotilla, has responsibility for the naval homage to commemorate D-day in the UK. \u201cThis is an opportunity to commemorate our comrades who have gone before us, and to salute those who are still with us. And to recognise the phenomenal feat they embarked upon, which, I think, even after 30 years of service, is very difficult to even begin to imagine what that must have been like,\u201d he said. Part of the Portsmouth flotilla\u2019s role during the D-day event is to perform a salute to the 300 veterans aboard the Royal British Legion\u2019s specially chartered MV Boudicca. \u201cAs the Boudicca sails with veterans to arrive in Normandy on 6 June, as they did 75 years ago, we are escorting her out, and further RN ships at sea will salute them as they go past,\u201d he said. The frigate andsubmarine hunter HMS St Albans will escort the Boudicca and fire a salute to the veterans on board. The flotilla includes frigates and minehunters taking part in a sailpast in the Solent. \u201cIt\u2019s been really heartening to see the young men and women of the armed forces coming together for this. Those same values and standards, the ethos of the armed forces 75 years ago and before, still resonate today,\u201d he said. With the dwindling number of second world war veterans, many have predicted this will be the last such occasion to commemorate D-day. \u201cNever say never,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe 70th anniversary was going to be the last event, and here we are five years later, And we still have a number of veterans. A naval historian once told me that history may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. And it is wonderful we can still engage with the veterans to remind ourselves about what they went through. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to see that spark in their eye as they recall what they did. Their humility is the thing that resonates with me. The \u2018I was just doing my job, I played a very small part\u2019. Not one of them would ever claim to be a hero of the day.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2019.
