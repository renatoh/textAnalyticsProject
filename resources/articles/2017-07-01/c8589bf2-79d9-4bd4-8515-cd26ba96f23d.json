The study by the Environment Agency (EA) found that although the majority of the UK\u2019s water companies came close to or exceeded their targets to improve water quality, the number of pollution incidents rose by 160 to 1,902 in 2016. There was also a small increase in the most serious sewage spills. The EA picked out South West Water as having the highest number of sewage spills and needing to make \u201csignificant improvements to their environmental performance\u201d. \u201cThey have not done enough to reduce pollution incidents and have repeatedly scored badly on this metric compared with other companies,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThe Environment Agency has introduced special measures to monitor and challenge the company\u2019s performance. These measures will remain in place until South West Water better protects the environment.\u201d South West Water said it had achieved its \u201cbest ever performance in a number of areas\u201d but admitted there was \u201cmore to do\u201d. \u201cWe continue to invest and innovate \u2013 for example, through using cutting-edge technology to monitor our sewerage network and purchasing a fleet of fully-equipped rapid response vehicles to enable staff to undertake sewer cleansing, surveying and reporting in one visit. This will help our response times and management of pollution incidents as we seek to drive numbers down.\u201d Three water companies were given a two-star rating meaning \u201ccompany requires improvement\u201d. Five of the nine companies had an increase in pollution incidents between 2015 and 2016. Water companies\u2019 ability to reduce pollution has a big impact on the health of rivers and beaches. Experts say good environmental performance supports wildlife, ensures people can enjoy their surroundings, and brings huge economic benefit. The EA, which is sponsored by the government\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, introduced tougher standards last year and it said water companies had made good progress in meeting the new targets. Toby Willison, executive director of operations for the EA, said: \u201cWater companies work hard to protect the environment. We have set more stringent targets and we are glad to see overall improvements but want to see more effort to avoid pollution incidents.\u201d He said that as a \u201cfair and effective regulator\u201d the EA was committed to highlighting best practice but also taking action to address poor practice. \u201cWhile we welcome the good progress being made we will continue to address any failings and will take enforcement action in the most serious cases.\u201d Wessex Water and United Utilities were the top performing water companies, according to the report. Earlier this year Thames Water was hit with a record fine of \u00a320.3m after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries and on to land, including the popular Thames path."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
