Yet it could have been worse: both teams might also have been deprived of an important player for three games of their anti-relegation campaigns. A pair of combustible Glaswegians, Leicester's Paul Dickov and Wolves' Alex Rae, were spared that fate presumably because the referee, Jeff Winter, made allowance for the desperate nature of an all-Midlands scrap which could well be carried on in the First Division next season. Winter is a rarity this season in that he has not issued a red card in the Premiership. Here, despite television evidence and a fly-on-the-wall recording near the dressing rooms, he maintained that record in the face of the pair's confrontation and later verbal exchange. The video advisory panel will have been alerted but the matter is unlikely to be taken any further because Winter, having separated Dickov and Rae while play continued, took action in lecturing them when the ball went dead almost a minute later. Perhaps, like many other neutrals, Winter was puzzled by the reaction of both men after they went eyeball-to-eyeball following a tackle by the Wolves midfielder on the Leicester striker two minutes before half-time. Rae suddenly went down and Dickov, sporting a red mark on his forehead, gestured at Rae and to the referee to take action. Nevertheless, Dickov appeared the greater aggressor. At half-time Dickov appeared to pursue Rae up the tunnel and the Leicester striker was restrained by staff as an unknown voice shouted: \"Get in there and shut up.\" But Dickov was not entirely silenced. After the game, he said of Rae: \"He stuck his head in and went down holding his face to get me sent off. I'd rather he'd have kicked me than do that. He's a cheat.\" Rae was philosophical, in speaking about two men who have now collected 16 cautions between them this season. \"It was just a wee spat. Dickov is one of those wholehearted players, a bit like myself. Put two guys together like that and there's always going to be a few sparks.\" Told that the television evidence was inconclusive, Rae said: \"That's good then - not guilty!\" Both managers made light of the incident, before trying to extract positives from a barren game which contrasted starkly with Wolves' startling 4-3 comeback in October. This latest meeting defied all predictions in that the Premiership's two most porous defences - 103 goals conceded between them - were unbreached. This surprised Dave Jones less than Leicester. \"The biggest thing was not to lose,\" said the Wolves manager. \"We knew what Micky's team would do and prepared all week for crosses into our box.\" Leicester were vindicated in keeping faith with Ian Walker, guilty of several blunders as his side let in a staggering 19 goals in their previous six matches. Steve Cotterill, last at Sunderland alongside the then manager Howard Wilkinson and now assisting Micky Adams, justifiably praised the goalkeeper for a \"world-class save\" as Walker turned aside Kenny Miller's angled header with the ball almost behind him. Unfortunately for Leicester, Paul Jones matched that intervention with a diving save to divert Les Ferdinand's header late on. The goalkeepers were otherwise untroubled though Steve Guppy did jab against a post seconds after the Dickov-Rae spat. Man of the match: Paul Dickov (Leicester City) The diminutive Leicester striker was involved in the worst and best aspects of the game. With characteristic vigour, he troubled Wolves' defence throughout and carried the burden of Leicester's attacking. Best moment: His twisting header from Steve Guppy's cross that beat Paul Jones but was hacked away from just in front of the line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
