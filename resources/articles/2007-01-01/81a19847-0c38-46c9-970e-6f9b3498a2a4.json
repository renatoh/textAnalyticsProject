It was quite wideranging, from political philosophy to political history, and I concentrated on British politics. I was also involved in student politics and the student union at university and I was chair of the student council, so I've had some hands-on experience as well.\" Since graduating and to get some work experience, James has spent time working as an intern in parliament. He has been job hunting. \"I've been looking around at various things I could do, including working for lobbying companies or for central or local government, and working in thinktanks and research is definitely one of the options,\" he says. We asked Mark Lafferty, human resources officer at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) to \"mock interview\" James for an entry-level job. Mark's verdict We'd expect all our applicants to be interested in politics - that's politics with a small p. James was obviously very interested and was able to speak very passionately about the subject. He'd been involved in student politics and talked in depth about higher education and also about pensions. That will stand him in good stead. We'd also expect applicants to have at least some experience of research, because the job they'll most likely be doing is research assistant. We don't expect them to be high-level researchers; if they were, they'd be over-qualified. But some understanding of different methodologies - for example, knowing the difference between quantitative and qualitative research and why you would use them - is important. James was very strong on his understanding of different research methods but wasn't so able to talk about the way he'd used them. He didn't say what kind of research he'd done for his dissertation, for example. He could have sold himself more. He also should have done some more research on IPPR and what we do. In any value-driven organisation it's important that people can demonstrate that they share the same values. That's not to say that we're looking for parrots, but it's a passionate place and the organisation needs that. You'd have to agree with our commitment to progressive politics and James needed to know a bit more about us to be able to demonstrate that. It's also important to understand that we're not just doing research for its own sake. Research and politics are intrinsically interlinked. James could have gone a bit further in his ideas about who might be interested in our research. He was very strong on events organisation, personal presentation and organisation. He does need to be able to talk a bit more about how he would manage long-term projects and work. With questions like \"How do you get your work done?\" he gave fairly standard answers that are fine, but to stand out he could have thought back to how he managed his dissertation at university, to give some real examples. Politics is a very competitive area. For every job like this we'd get about 100-200 applicants, and maybe up to 300 if it was a particularly popular area, such as climate change. So it's hard to break in. Once you do, though, you can progress quickly. James just needs to stick with it and do a bit more research. He's very eager and he's a good candidate. I'm sure he will find the right job, he just needs to persevere. James's reaction After the interview, they made the point that I got better as I went along, and I felt that, too. I should have done some more research on the company and I will do in future. I only did a bit and it wasn't sufficient, so some of the questions threw me. I was more confident in other areas, such as talking about my experience in politics. Some of the questions meant that I quickly had to think back to things I did at university or A-level and they caught me off-guard. With some of the questions, I discovered that I knew more than I thought I did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
