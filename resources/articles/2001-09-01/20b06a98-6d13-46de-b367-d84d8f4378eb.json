Yesterday France suggested that compulsory identity cards might do the trick. Daniel Bernard, French ambassador to London, conceded that family and community links and the fact that many are English speaking are the main reasons that these migrants are so desperate to get here. He went on to claim that migrants also came because they knew about the UK's laxity over official identification. \"They will not need identity papers because there are none and once you reach Britain it would be easier to remain there.\" There is not much a government can do about the first two reasons that asylum seekers come to the UK, but it could do something about internal identity checks. The ambassador's suggestion is further evidence that, although it is now nearly 50 years since the UK scrapped Aneurin Bevan's \"internal passports\" (which gave access to wartime rationing), the debate over identity cards refuses to die. The last time it flared was five years ago when the Tory home secretary, Michael Howard, prompted by the introduction of a new photographic driving licence, made a doomed attempt to introduce an identity card as an anti-crime measure. It was killed off by a revolt in the cabinet by the libertarian right. A compulsory identity card is now a non-starter. Labour has never favoured a compulsory card and even the police are warning that there would be widespread repugnance if they were given the power to stop people in the street and demand \"your papers please\". But, contrary to popular belief, identity cards in France are voluntary. Some 99% of people carry them because they have become essential. You need them to vote, to collect social security benefits or even to visit the post office. Indeed there has always been a pragmatic liberal view in this country in favour of identity cards which argues that we already carry so many bits of plastic that we might as well have just one multi-purpose card, permitting travel on a bus, taking money out or getting into the office. Labour Home Office ministers did try to propose such a \"citizen's access card\" only four years ago but it did not garner much support around the rest of the government. But the idea is not dead. Earlier this year MPs on the Commons' home affairs select committee, after studying the immigration problems around the Channel tunnel, strongly backed the introduction of a voluntary entitlement card to supplement border controls and so tackle illegal migrants. They argued that an entitlement card would be used to gain access to a range of public services, for example to get treatment in a hospital or welfare benefits or to borrow a library book. It could be done, they said, without undermining civil liberties or good race relations. \"What we have in mind is a card which the bearer would be expected to produce only when exercising a right or gaining access to a service. It is possible that people who are not genuine asylum seekers are attracted to the UK by the perception that access to public services in this country is easier than in, say, France. If the UK adopted an entitlement card system, it is possible that that perception would diminish over time.\" But the then home secretary, Jack Straw, was not impressed. He responded that an entitlement card that had to be produced for all benefits and services might start out voluntary but would quickly be seen as a compulsory identity card. Such a valuable card would need to be protected by hi-tech security measures, such as a machine-checkable facial image, eyeball recognition, or fingerprint. But these techniques are still very complex and costly to produce. All ser vice delivery points would have to have include sophisticated \"reading devices\" to check whether the card presented was genuine. The whole of Whitehall would also have to introduce comprehensive data sharing arrangements if the government was really going to deliver on its promise to open access across all public services. The idea presumably would be that illegal migrants who did not have such a card would find it far more difficult living underground as an \"undocumented migrant\". But there is a flaw in this idea. As even the Immigration Service Union points out - and it has a vested interest in ever-tougher controls - it is easy to forge an identity card. French cards for example are so old-fashioned they do not even have a photograph on them. Some are even handwritten. The wonder is that would-be migrants do not just get one and buy a Eurostar ticket and travel in safety rather than risking death by leaping on to the trains at Coquelles. The identity card debate is not an academic exercise. The next generation of British passports, to be introduced in a few years, will incorporate some elements of the new smart technology, such as iris scanning and automatic facial recognition, with the specific aim of frustrating the illegal migrant coming in on a forged passport. Officially, the Home Office says it is keeping an open mind on the subject: \"The government is aware that there is some degree of public support for a national identity card scheme in this country, although there is no consensus as to what purpose the scheme would serve.\" The identity card debate is not over yet. \u0095 Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor. alan.travis@theguardian.com Related articles 03.09.2001: Asylum system in peril 03.09.2001: Dead end where desperation holds sway 03.09.2001, Leader: Tunnel escape routes 02.09.2001: UK 'could take 200,000 a year' 31.08.2001: 44 caught in Channel tunnel Interactive guide Seeking asylum: who, where, and why?
