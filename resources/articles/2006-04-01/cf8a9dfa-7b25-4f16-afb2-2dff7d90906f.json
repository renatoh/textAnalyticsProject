One bath at the resort in Hakone, 60 miles south-west of Tokyo, has been filled with fish that like nothing better than to eat bathers' dead skin and bacteria. The Garra rufa, also known as doctor fish, can survive in hot water and are commonly found living in outdoor spas in Turkey, where they have been used to treat skin ailments such as psoriasis. Bathers are banned from exposing anything other than their feet. Fans of the piscine pedicure describe the nibbling as pleasantly ticklish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
