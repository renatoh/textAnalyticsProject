The midfielder, who has joined Aston Villa on a season\u2019s loan, was a target of abuse during the struggles under David Moyes last season and has been heavily criticised on Twitter. \u201cI am happy to get away from some of the negativity,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cIf any footballer gets a bit of stick off their own fans they are going to be hurt. Football is a game of opinions and you can\u2019t please everyone. \u201cI probably wasn\u2019t the only player to get it last year and for as long as Manchester United aren\u2019t winning trophies, players will get criticised. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a league title and 13 England caps. You don\u2019t turn into a bad player just because somebody says so on Twitter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
