In truth the flies are not as religiously observant as their name suggests. My first was on 19 April and they reached their greatest abundance by early May. They are hairy, black-bodied, long-legged danglers, with a swollen, slightly humped thorax and, in the males, rounded goggle-eyes. They have a lethargic manner that could easily be mistaken for menace. I have one resting on my cuff as I write these words; another moves furtively through my hair. They are really one of life's great victims. Their strategy as a species seems to be to flood the market with their protein and then, with all their predators in a state of glut, to hope that at least some escape to breed. For now, every spider's web along my usual beat is filled with their dried-out black husk bodies, twisting and billowing on the breeze. In the silken den of a rather splendid orb-web spider called Larinioides cornutus, I notice how she has four stiff-bristled legs curved around the soft body of her latest immobilised fly. Higher up the food chain, however, the same insects can also acquire an extraordinary precision of movement because the gloriously deft summer falcon known as the hobby loves St Mark's flies. Overhead, the birds swing down to seize the prey as yet invisible to me. However, I am forewarned of the moment of impact because in the instant of connection the falcon seems almost to be struck by a pulse of electricity and the current momentarily disrupts the bird's own sweet flowing. The wings close forwards, the legs rise up and forwards and the insect is taken to meet the beak in one sleek action. In the following split-second the falcon's normal flight blossoms once more from that awkward twisting motion of life into death, death into life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
