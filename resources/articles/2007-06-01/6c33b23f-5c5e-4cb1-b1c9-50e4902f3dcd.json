At an emergency convention in Dublin's Mansion House, more than 86% of Green party members backed their negotiating team's decision to support Mr Ahern - whom they had previously campaigned to remove from office. Immediately after the vote, the party's leader, Trevor Sargent, announced that he would stand down from the leadership, citing his campaign pledges not to work with Fianna F\u00e1il. Mr Sargent said he was, nonetheless, delighted that the Greens were entering government for the first time. \"It is the proudest day in my life,\" he declared. \"After 25 years of struggle ... the possibility is there to see our policies implemented in government.\" With Fianna F\u00e1il winning 78 seats in the May 24 general election, Mr Ahern needed the support of the six Green deputies, or TDs, to give his third successive administration a majority in the 166-seat chamber. He will have the support of two Progressive Democrats and several independents, guaranteeing him long-term stability. The Greens are seeking at least one cabinet post. The programme of government agreed between the parties involves slashing domestic electricity use, expanding renewable energy sources and reopening railway lines to discourage car usage. Specific commitments given to the Greens by Mr Ahern include a climate change commission, reducing Irish greenhouse gas emissions by 3% a year, generating a third of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and installing \"smart electronic meters\" in every home to reduce consumption. Official air travel will be subject to carbon offsetting in support of forests. Rail lines will be reopened along the western corridor from Ennis to Claremorris, trains will run again to Navan and commuter rail services will be built around Galway and Cork. Within Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, there will be feasibility studies on trams and light rail. There will be a directly elected mayor of Dublin by 2011. There was disappointment that Green party negotiators had failed to persuade Fianna F\u00e1il to reroute the planned M3 motorway further away from Tara, the ancient seat of the High Kings of Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
