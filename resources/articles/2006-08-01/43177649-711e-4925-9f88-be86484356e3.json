A mother had written in to complain about aggressive slogans on clothing on sale in Mothercare and M&amp;S and I wondered if anyone shared her sentiments. It seems that, despite my efforts over broadband connections and combi boilers, infant fashion is the real issue du jour - I haven't had such a postbag since the days of Cable &amp; Wireless. \"You suck - I blow,\" proclaimed the chest of an eight-year-old girl spotted by Chris McGrath. A young child seen by Denise Bartlett wore a top that read \"Future footballer's wife\" and Ailsa Carmichael and Judith Bennett were respectively moved by \"Madam in the making\" and \"I saw it, I wanted it, I threw a fit, I got it\". Other tender sentiments include \"Drive it like you stole it\" (above a picture of a pram), \"I only cry when ugly people hold me\", \"I will break you\" and \"I'm hot, you're not.\" \"We should not be inflicting this sort of thing on vulnerable children who may not have the choice whether to wear them,\" rages Susan Gifford. \"Manufacturers and stockists should take a more responsible attitude.\" Pamela Stirrat and Vicky Pateman both worry that T-shirt slogans reinforce social stereotypes. \"Far from being harmless fun, I think printing 'Little monster' and 'Watch out, trouble's coming' on boy's shirts and 'Little angel' or 'Pretty girl' on girls' work on society's psyche, implying that boys are naughty and girls are sweet and nice,\" says Stirrat. \"I know I would be keeping a special eye on a boy in such a shirt at a toddler group because I would half expect him to live up to his slogan.\" At this point I reckon professional help is needed, so I ask Professor Helen Haste, a psychologist at the University of Bath who specialises in gender stereotyping, whether we are harming our children by cladding them in slogans. She thinks that Guardian readers should question whether they are taking a snobbish view of what shoppers might think of as a bit of fun. \"But,\" she says, \"parents do have to ask themselves what message they are trying to convey about themselves and their child. Society hasn't yet taken on board the fact that T-shirts have turned the body into a billboard which can be used frivolously or seriously and that any message says a great deal about the identity of the wearer. But most of these T-shirts just reflect a passing fashion and are not taken seriously.\" It seems, though, that there are slogans to gladden the heart of the Guardian reader. Dozens of you mentioned the Mothers' Milk Marketing Board, which sells infantwear bearing slogans such as \"I like milk from my mum, not any old cow\" and \"Formula is for suckers\". \"To me these slogans pass on a message that I'm not bold enough to say to people's faces,\" says Nerys Bowen. \"However, I don't like slogans that talk of bad attitude. I once saw one on a little girl which read, 'If you think I'm a bitch, you should see my mother.' Where will it end? 'I'm a shoplifting crack-whore and I've got a knife'? Aw, cute!\" Dying O2 phones: an update O2's decision to end the service to elderly pay-as-you-go mobile phones also excited you when I reported the case of a reader left stranded without warning when his handset went dead. It turns out that many more of you have also found yourselves with suddenly useless phones. But there is happy news for those who have not yet thrown theirs away: O2 are giving out \u00a34.99 Sim cards free to those affected (although some owners have been charged) and these will reactivate your ancient equipment. Funny that O2 forgot to mention this option when they advised customers to upgrade or use someone else's. \u00b7 Write to Shopping at 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER or email consumer@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
