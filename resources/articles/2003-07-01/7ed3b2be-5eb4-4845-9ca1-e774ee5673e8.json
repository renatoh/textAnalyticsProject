He writes: I have spent three months messing about with figures trying to reduce our monthly outgoings. Our endowment policy for repaying a \u00a325,000 mortgage will finish in August 2008. When we bought the house, I did not realise that it would finish after I retired. I noticed this lately but I am not willing to make a case of it because it is down to my own stupidity and I took it out so long ago that I am outside the time limits for complaining. Like millions of other homeowners I have a file of annual updates on our mortgage endowment plan. They form a disconcerting story of beguiling optimism descending into shameless pessimism. The tenor of these letters has changed abruptly to tell me I am now on the danger list. It promised me a \u00a314,000 surplus and now I am looking at a forecast shortfall of \u00a33,600, based on 4 per cent growth, but I suspect this may be optimistic. Bonus rates on the basic sum have slid from 5 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Bonus rates on bonuses have plunged from a best of 9 per cent to the current low of 0.5 per cent. That means they collapsed from a high of \u00a3700 to \u00a390 last year. I cannot see the bonus exceeding \u00a390 for the next five years. Projections of terminal bonuses have crashed from 65 per cent to 18 per cent and recent news says that some providers have cancelled the terminal bonus altogether. I had been brought up to believe that one should always hold on to the mortgage as it was a cheap loan and anybody who paid it off was cutting themselves off from flexibility and money in hand. But, deeply unimpressed by these predictions, we are thinking about allocating \u00a325,000 of our savings to paying off the mortgage next year when we emerge from the penalty zone of our current mortgage. We have about \u00a350,000 available from various investments, including shares and \u00a320,000 in Premium Bonds. Even if we do that, I have serious doubts about keeping up payments into the endowment policy as in each of the remaining years I will be contributing \u00a3579 gross for a return of about \u00a390 in bonuses with no assurance of a terminal bonus. In other words, each pound submitted into the savings plan, not allowing for an unknown cost of life insurance, is turned into 15p. I thought of repaying \u00a35,000 or \u00a310,000 but that seems to effect little overall long-term saving. The best projection I could work out is paying off the whole lot once I am out of the penalty in August next year. We are not badly off but we are a canny couple who don't want to spend money unnecessarily. Action plan You have two decisions to take: whether to repay your mortgage before 2008 and whether to continue paying the premiums of your endowment policy. Advisers agree you should repay the mortgage immediately you have passed the penalty period. David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country Mortgages explains: 'It comes down to the return on savings versus the interest paid on the mortgage. If the mortgage interest outweighs the net return on savings, it is a worthwhile move.' Anna Bowes of financial adviser Chase de Vere reckons: 'Paying off the mortgage gives them peace of mind and they can use money they have languishing around, particularly their Premium Bonds where the odds are lengthening and prize pot is reducing.' Financial adviser Ian Millward says: 'If he won't need the money and it is gathering dust in a savings account, he will get a better return clearing his mortgage.' But he warns: 'If this involves cashing in shares, it needs more thought, as shares do still offer an opportunity for higher returns and the stock market is still a long way off its peak.' The decision about the endowment policy is less clear cut. No one can tell you how much this will pay out in five years' time and it might be more than you have projected if the stock market improves and Eagle Star has a reasonable volume of equities in the fund. Bowes explains: 'Asset allocation is a key factor. Policies with a low exposure to equities have a reduced opportunity for capital growth. In 2002, Eagle Star's UK equities were down to 56 per cent, which is not too bad.' Hollingworth points out that it is a dilemma many borrowers are facing: 'Whether to keep their poorly performing endowments going or cut their losses and ditch them.' To start, if you cash in, you have to decide what to do with the proceeds. Building society rates are so low that you might get the same as keeping the endowment. Hollingworth advises: 'Considering that the endowment has only five years to run, he should probably keep the policy, particularly as he does not depend on it to repay the mortgage. If the stock market bounces back, the performance will improve and he might pick up a reasonable terminal bonus, although there are no guarantees as to how much this may, or may not, be.' Bowes disagrees: 'Once they have paid off the mortgage, they should not worry about paying any more premiums into the endowment. That would be throwing good money after bad.' Eagle Star says that if you stop paying premiums, you have three options: \u00b7 Surrender the plan and receive the surrender value; \u00b7 Allow the unpaid premiums to be paid for out of the surrender value, so allowing a debt and interest to be built on the policy - bonuses will continue to be paid and the basic sum assured is not reduced; \u00b7 Amend the policy to a 'paid-up' status which means you will not get a terminal bonus and the basic sum assured would reduce from \u00a38,750 to \u00a37,117. If you have the policy made paid-up, you keep the life insurance, but at a reduced level. You could also sell the policy to a dealer, although you would lose the life insurance element. Hollingworth says that if you want to get shot of it, you should check what price is available on the second-hand endowment market. But Bowes reveals: 'I have spoken to a traded endowment company who says they will not find a buyer.' Millward suspects you have lost faith in the policy: 'Provided there are no penalties for making it paid-up, it is a good idea to suspend future payments. He could divert the money into a monthly stocks and shares Isa where he would benefit directly from any stock market recovery.' But you would lose the terminal bonus. Each decision involves penalties and you need to check them all with Eagle Star. Bowes believes: 'Once they know all the penalties that apply, they will probably know which route to take.' Jim's plan 1. Repay the mortgage immediately the penalty period ends. 2. Check all the penalties applying to each route you can take. 3. Ask Eagle Star how much of the fund is currently invested in shares. 4. Decide whether to keep the policy going or have it made paid-up. Let us help you Do you need some financial coaching?
