The phone rings. It's my sister, Louise. \"Please come on over, Jamie,\" she says. I go to her room. She's looking a mess as she's been up all night at the Versace party, but even in a mess Louise is beautiful. \"Where have you been?\" she asks. \"Sleeping with Jodie Kidd,\" I smile. \"Duh, it was Bibi.\" Well, they look the same. \"My career's going down the pan, you've got to help me,\" Louise insists. \"The Osano show is my last chance.\" I go back to Bibi. She's just OD'd on smack. I call Fred, Osano's minder. \"Just like Louise,\" he says. \"What?\" \"Don't worry,\" he continues, \"it's got nothing to do with the rest of the story.\" I pick up Fred's coat by mistake. There's something heavy in the pocket. I put my hand inside. \"It's a gun.\" \"You've got to help me,\" says Osano. \"My show's tonight. I really need Louise, Amanda and Bibi to make it a success.\" I look at the collection. It seems stale, but I make a few alterations. The lights come on at the end of the show. Louise calls me to the front and kisses me. \"Fantastic,\" says Osano, \"We're on all the front pages. You've got to stay with me for Milan.\" Louise holes up outside Courmayeur, while I work on the designs. One evening, Louise comes into town. \"You know that neither of us had a father,\" she says. \"We came out of a clam shell.\" \"That's good,\" I reply. \"Now we can sleep together.\" \"You realise that Louise's career is taking off again on rumours of her relationship with you,\" Bibi says bitchily. \"Milan was wonderful,\" beams Osano. \"Have a ticket for Paris.\" Louise joins me. \"What I said about the clams,\" she starts, \"it wasn't true.\" \"Ah well.\" We fuck all night on the sleeper. \"I'm arresting you on suspicion of murdering Osano on the train,\" says a cop. \"Your fingerprints were on the gun.\" \"I can get you off,\" Louise remembers. \"Those workers at Lyon were watching us fuck at the time in question.\" \"I'd rather go to prison for ever and ever than have my relationship with you made public.\" And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested... Two dim-witted siblings, utterly at home in the fashion industry, get caught up in incest and murder"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
