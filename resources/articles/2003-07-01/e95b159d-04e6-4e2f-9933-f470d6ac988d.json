Much of that optimism is based on the backstroke excellence of Sarah Price and Katy Sexton - and the distinct possibility that one of them could become Britain's first individual world champion since David Wilkie in 1975. It is highly likely that the rivals will finish first and second in the 200 metres backstroke and Price has no doubt that British swimming is on the rise again. \"British swimming is going to take the world by storm, whether it's this year or next,\" she asserted. Yet, if it is not a huge ask to be the best British team ever, the aspiration is still way above the lowly plateau that Bill Sweetenham found the team living on when he took over the reins after a disastrous Sydney Olympics where not a single medal was won. Everyone poolside at Loughborough yesterday, as the British team congregated, said something about Sweetenham. Not to his face, of course. He is too tough for that. Just quietly, to anyone who asked. \"He's got us working together,\" said Sexton, who was a high-riser back in 1998 when as a 16-year-old she took the Commonwealth Games 200m backstroke title in Kuala Lumpur. It shocked everyone, especially Sexton, who had not rated her title chances that day. It should have been the start of a glorious career for the Portsmouth teenager but she saw the other side of the coin in September 2001. \"I woke up in the middle of the night with a stabbing pain in my back. At first I thought I had dislocated my shoulder blade because it was sticking right out,\" she said. There was no such luck, for the diagnosis was not a dislocation but a damaged nerve in the upper arm, and the cure was six months' rest. Backstroke swimmers have it hard enough anyway, spending much of their lives staring at ceilings, but Sexton now had to swim without her arms as well. There was never a thought that she would not; nine sessions in the pool each week, as per normal, and length after length with her arms down by her side, just paddling her legs like billyo and occasionally throwing out her good left arm for a turn. The nerve regrew and the strength and mobility eventually came back to her right arm, but it was touch and go whether she would make the Commonwealth team for Manchester. Yet she scraped in and won a bronze medal. \"It meant more to me than the gold I won four years earlier. I think as a person the injury made me,\" said Sexton, who has continued to progress since. This season, the 21-year-old's winning time in the trials in the Sheffield pool in March has taken her to the top of the world rankings for the 200m backstroke. The world No2 in the same event is at the other end of the Loughborough pool. The assured 24-year-old Price, who won two gold medals in the Manchester Commonwealth Games, will swim all three backstroke events in Barcelona and Sexton may do so too, but both rate the 200m as their best event. \"Doubt? There's no room for it,\" says Price. A British one-two in Spain would be too outrageous. Or would it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
