Already comfortably on top when the England striker limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after the half-hour,today Steve Bruce's team refused to be discomfited and ultimately deserved to win by a wider margin than that provided by Amr Zaki's penalty a minute before half-time. Bruce, who is reported to be close to completing a \u00a34.5m deal with the Mexican side Necaxa for their Colombian forward Hugo Rodallega Mart\u00ednez, said afterwards that he had not received a bid for Heskey or any other player. \"Long may that remain the case,\" he added, unsurprisingly given that this was Wigan's fifth win in their past six Premier League matches, taking them to seventh in the table. \"We're not going to get carried away, but anyone who has watched us will be aware it's no fluke we're in the top half,\" said Bruce. \"We'll see how far we can go. There's a lot of big clubs with huge histories and traditions and support down at the bottom, so it's fantastic for a club like ours, with our resources, to be punching above our weight. We'll see how far we can go. It's fantastic for a club like ours, with our resources, to be punching above our weight. Bolton and Blackburn have done it in the past \u2014 why can't it be our turn?\" Although talk of a Uefa Cup place is premature, Wigan look unlikely to be dragged back into the relegation fight. They also lost Chris Kirkland before the kick-off, the goalkeeper injuring an adductor muscle during the warm-up, but they always travel with two spare goalkeepers and the experienced Mike Pollitt did a solid job, well protected by the centre-halves, Paul Scharner and Titus Bramble, who were outstanding, and by a lively and well balanced midfield four. Lee Cattermole and Wilson Palacios dominated their opposite numbers, Kevin Nolan and Gavin McCann, to such an extent that Nolan, the Bolton captain, was substituted. Wigan might have been two up before Andy O'Brien's hopelessly mistimed jump flattened Henri Camara to give away the penalty. Earlier a Nolan error had given Camara a shooting opportunity which Jussi Jaaskelainen turned round the post. The Finn also had to save from Cattermole before Zaki sent him the wrong way from the spot. Bolton had chances to pinch a point, notably in the 54th minute when Palacios headed Danny Shittu's header from Matthew Taylor's corner off the line. Replays suggested the decision was generous to the visitors. \"All Palacios's body and head are over the line, so it was a clever trick if the ball wasn't,\" said Gary Megson before acknowledging that Bolton, despite Shittu heading Taylor's chipped through-ball on to the top of the Wigan crossbar, had been second best. \"We hit the bar and had what we believe was a legitimate goal ruled out, but we haven't played well.Cattermole and Palacios worked their s. ocks off and got a lot of second balls, but a lot of our more well-known players didn't play at all well today,\" Megson's team have now lost four of their past five games and he said: \"We're working with a squad of 14 and we've got to get some players in, but there isn't a huge amount [of money] available.\" Man of the match Lee Cattermole (Wigan)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
