That phase will pass with the shock of Sir Ming's sudden decision. Labour complaints about the Brownite teenagers' botched election have been dimmed by its unintended consequence: Sir Ming's decision to quit. That was not what either rival wanted: he was no threat. Now the instant conventional wisdom is that David Cameron has more to fear from the likely victory of fresh-faced Nick Clegg - at 40 just three months his junior - if he can hang on to floating voters in the south. But is personality and a pretty face all that matters? Some Lib Dem MPs think so. Clegg, Chris Huhne and Steve Webb, the most tipped third contender, have been working together on the just-in-case manifesto. \"There's a fair degree of agreement,\" says one MP. \"We have a clear narrative and now need someone to articulate it beyond our core supporters,\" says another. The candidates are already promising each other not to go dirty - \"we have to work together when it's over\" - but will try to highlight policy differences where they can find them. If Steve Webb stands he will be the candidate of the old Liberal left. He has the support needed to get on the ballot paper, but knows he trails badly. Running will take more than eight weeks of his life and could take the campaign spending limit of \u00a350,000, which he doesn't have. So Webb hesitates, whereas the Cleggies texted party workers for support within hours of Sir Ming's statement and the Huhnistas started organising. Webb's policy pitch would overlap with Huhne's. Both are \"social liberals\" in the sense that Lloyd George would have recognised 100 years ago when pre-1914 globalisation opened up huge wealth gaps. They favour \"positive freedoms\" from fear or want. Huhne does not want the free market and choice option to be their party's default position on public service reform as it was often Tony Blair's. Nor does Webb. Both want to see locally accountable schools and hospitals. Though Huhne (an ex-City economist) also wrote for the free-market Orange Book policy tract, Clegg is the one dubbed the crypto-Tory, the \"Orange Book Lib Dem\". But he too talks of personalised services for the \"Google generation\" and a better balance between freedom and security. All three see Gordon Brown as a centralising Fabian administrator, and stress civil liberties. Huhne wants a \"freedom bill\" to reclaim them. Clegg condemns Labour's \"penal state\". His rivals admit that Huhne's green policy package is central to their message. But Webb thinks foreign policy, notably Iraq, has been too prominent under the past three party leaders and wants more emphasis on domestic issues. He favours social networking - the Facebook approach - to get the message across. There are subtle differences of substance here, on the left-right spectrum Lib Dems claim to loathe. But they are less clear than the personalities: they might decide the matter after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
