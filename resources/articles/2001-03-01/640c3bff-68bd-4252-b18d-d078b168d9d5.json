Received warmly by a below-average crowd, Holloway now has 12 games to craft a thriller from a horror after Rangers let slip a half-time lead and fell back into the relegation places. Otherwise the mirth generated by an erroneous reference to this \"Division Two clash\" in his programme notes will taste bitter when reality bites. \"It's exceptionally tight,\" he said. \"If we were to win two games on the spin we could be up to 16th place. \"Everybody knows where the club was and where it is now - and they're absolutely scared to death of where it might end up. That's a massive point to me.\" Holloway took Bristol Rovers to the brink of the Second Division play-offs last year before an end-of-season wobble cost them a place but this season Rovers' own relegation fears prompted his sacking at the end of January. Diminutive and genial, he spoke candidly of his hopes to bring the best out of the Rangers squad inherited from Gerry Francis - despite being overrun in the second half here, they did not drop their heads and give up - and conceded that glances are being cast towards the March 22 transfer deadline. \"We're trying to bring players into certain areas,\" he said. \"We've got to bombard it [the transfer market] and we've got three weeks to do it.\" The dancing hordes in the School End told of a different story as Sheffield United leapt into the play-off places. After Michel Ngonge headed Rangers in front, United's wide-right maestro Paul Devlin ran the show. Ludek Miklosko flapped his whippy cross to Shaun Murphy, who drilled an equaliser; Georges Santos headed in Bobby Ford's cross from the left soon after and then Devlin charged through the defence and laid off sublimely for Santos to end the contest. Neil Warnock, the United manager, was pleased to rise above the dotted line but flirt ing with the play-offs brings a nervy quest for perfection. \"There were times when we were 3-1 up when we did things I don't want us to do,\" he said. \"If we start thinking we're a good team, we become a bad team; if we are on top of our game, we are a good team.\" With weeks of elation, anguish and convoluted mathematics ahead, spare a thought for poor Mrs Warnock. \"My missus is panicking, she's expecting on May 22,\" the manager said, his baby due six days before the play-off final. It is a world away from Holloway's mission. \"I'm going to try,\" he said. \"That's what they're going to put on my headstone: 'Here lies Olly: he tried'.\" - an endearing, if peculiar, way of asserting he and Rangers are not dead yet. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
