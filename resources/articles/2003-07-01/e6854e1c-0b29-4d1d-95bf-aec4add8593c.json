Sally was in post for just seven months. If she had lived, she would have built on the success of her predecessor Rob Selwood (obituary, January 10 2002) in turning the NCTJ into a financially sound organisation that, in April, attracted a record number of young journalists for its certificate exam. She was worried about the \"dinosaur\" image of exam board members, markers and moderators, and was keen to find new blood. The importance of extending the NCTJ's operations beyond its newspaper base more fully into magazines, whose journalists are mainly trained elsewhere, if at all, was another concern. Sally was born in Walthamstow, east London, the daughter of a pharmaceutical rep. She attended Woodford county high school for girls, and left at 16 to do secretarial jobs, first at the BBC Arabic service and then with a merchant bank. After taking time out to have children, Sally joined the NCTJ in 1982. She became PA to the director - the post, renamed chief executive, that she was later to fill. From 1990, Sally was the examinations manager, and proved a steady hand in defending the NCTJ's proficiency certificate against the new national vocational qualifications. The assessment-based NVQs seemed set to take over, but editors preferred the exam-based qualification and the proficiency certificate continues to flourish. Sally was later appointed training director and deputy chief executive, beating off several well-qualified external candidates. Outside work, Sally's chief interest was sport. She is survived by her husband, David, and their children, Jamie and Zoe. \u00b7 Sally Joan Mellis, training administrator, born August 31 1946; died June 29 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
