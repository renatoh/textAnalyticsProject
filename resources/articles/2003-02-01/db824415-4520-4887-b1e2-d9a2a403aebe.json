As job applications involve revealing much about yourself and pinning hope on the response, that hurts more than being ignored. The standard employer's excuse, that replying to all applicants is too time consuming, is poor. Email replies take little time and are a welcome confirmation your application was at least seen. Even the most overworked individual will respond to those they value. The more it happens the harder it becomes not to betray your resentment or resignation. It's essential to guard against that. Each new application puts you in touch with people who know nothing about your past disappointments. Assume each new contact deserves your best and most cheerful effort. If you don't receive an acknowledgment, check it did arrive and use the opportunity to find out when shortlisted candidates will be notified. That provides you with a hope cut-off date. In some industries showing tenacity can work in your favour. However, be aware that employers are increasingly wary of giving anything other than bland replies for fear of appearing to be discriminatory. \u00b7 Got a career problem?
