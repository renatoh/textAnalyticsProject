Speaking with TVLine, King said the show is going to mirror the real-life presidential race. \u201c[When] the Iowa caucus happens [on 1 February], it\u2019s going to happen in our show. We\u2019re trying to parallel what\u2019s happening on our show with what\u2019s happening in reality,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cIf Peter runs, he is running against Hillary.\u201d King said that trying to keep up with real-life political developments might prove tricky, adding that he\u2019s \u201cstunned in politics how things change overnight\u201d. Fellow executive producer Michelle King did say the writers wouldn\u2019t be beholden to all developments in the race (for example, if Clinton does win the nomination that doesn\u2019t mean Florrick can\u2019t triumph in the show), but the Good Wife joins a growing list of shows in which art imitates life very closely. Homeland\u2019s new series, set in Berlin, will include ripped-from-the-headlines storylines featuring references to Isis, Edward Snowden and Vladimir Putin. Scandal and Black Dynamite both featured episodes which mirrored and commented on the recent police shootings of unarmed black men in America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
