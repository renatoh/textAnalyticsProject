Ten reasons for the demise of a club", "bodyText": "Portsmouth, FA Cup winners in May 2008 with a squad including Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch, Lassana Diarra, Sulley Muntari, Sol Campbell and Glen Johnson, are now in financial crisis. They face a winding-up petition in the high court on Wednesday for unpaid tax and, following a takeover this week, are under their fourth different overseas-based owner since the summer. This is a guide to the key characters and bewildering series of events which have unfolded during the crisis at Fratton Park. Why are Portsmouth in trouble? The club did not make enough money to pay the multimillion-pound transfer fees and high wages for the squad of star players assembled by a previous manager Harry Redknapp, who led them to the FA Cup win. During their six and a half years in the Premier League, Portsmouth have not expanded Fratton Park to accommodate more than 20,000 supporters. The overspending was funded with loans from Alexandre \"Sacha\" Gaydamak, who owned the club from 2006 until the start of this season, and with bank loans. However, as the costs grew and the recession hit, the banks demanded their money back, and Gaydamak decided he could no longer afford to fund the club. Almost the whole FA Cup-winning squad has been sold but the ongoing debts and costs, which included instalments still owing on players like Johnson and Muntari, are too much for the club. Why did Sacha Gaydamak decide to sell the club? Gaydamak has said he was financially hit by the recession and would sell the club to a buyer willing to fund the club's losses and keep it going, preferably in the Premier League. Gaydamak is owed money himself, although his advisers said that he wrote off \u00a313.5m of loans. Gaydamak's trust fund agreed to become directly liable, instead of the club, to Standard Bank, for around \u00a325m. The club owes that money now to Gaydamak's trust, not the banks, and together with other amounts owing to Gaydamak, owes him a total of \u00a333.5m. A \u00a39.5m instalment due to be repaid at the end of January was not met; the rest is due for repayment in stages by 2012. Gaydamak still owns the land around Fratton Park, although not the stadium itself. Who bought the club from Gaydamak? The Dubai-based businessman Sulaiman al-Fahim bought Pompey in August, paying Gaydamak just \u00a31, and promising to put \u00a35m into the club and find more money soon after that. However, Fahim failed to secure the further funding. Pompey's players were not paid their wages at the end of September, then the Premier League called in Fahim and told him no further delay would be acceptable. Who bought the club the second time? After 43 days Fahim sold 90% of the club to a company, Falcondrone, registered in the British Virgin Islands. The Premier League was told that a Saudi Arabian businessman, Ali al-Faraj, was the sole owner of Falcondrone. Who was involved with Ali al-Faraj? A number of people have been advising or working at Fratton Park since the Faraj takeover. Faraj himself was described as a businessman of \"moderate wealth\" by Gaydamak's advisers and he has never been to the club. Ahmed al-Faraj, Ali's brother, is based in London where he is a property investor and he has been involved in running Portsmouth and has attended matches. Yoram Yusepov, a lawyer who divides his time between Tel Aviv and London, and who has been involved in investments with Ahmed al-Faraj, has also been involved. Mark Jacob, a London solicitor specialising in property, and a football fan (he supports Spurs), became executive director at the club after the takeover. Daniel Azougy, an Israeli former lawyer who has been convicted in that country of fraud offences, was brought in to sort out the finances. The Premier League insisted that Azougy must not attend their regular meetings to receive updates about Pompey's situation. Why did the Faraj takeover not stabilise Portsmouth? Quite simply they did not have enough money. They had intended to borrow to invest in Pompey, thought to be up to \u00a330m, from the private bank EFG, but did not secure it. Instead they borrowed what was said to be \u00a317m from a Hong Kong-based businessman, Balram Chainrai. His company, Portpin, was granted a mortgage over Fratton Park and the assets of the club itself. Yet despite that money coming in, the club still owed millions, in tax and VAT to HM Revenue and Customs, to other clubs and to pay a wage bill which remains too high. In January the Premier League withheld from Portsmouth the \u00a37m it pays to all clubs from the league's TV deal and used it to pay other clubs to whom Pompey still owed money from signing players, including Spurs, Chelsea and the French clubs Lens and Rennes. Players still needed to be sold and in the January transfer window the club sold the defender Younes Kaboul, to Redknapp at Spurs, for \u00a35m, and the goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to Stoke for \u00a33.25m. Part of the fee for Kaboul was withheld by the Premier League to pay money Pompey still owed Chelsea for Glen Johnson, who was signed in August 2007, and Watford, for Tommy Smith and Mike Williamson. Why did Balram Chainrai, the club's fourth owner since the summer, take over this week? Chainrai told the Guardian on Wednesday this week that the \u00a317m he loaned the club was to be repaid in instalments but he had received no money and so he was taking control of the club. Portsmouth issued a statement on Thursday saying this had happened, because Chainrai had a right to do so if he were not paid, and confirmed that Chainrai had taken \"a controlling interest\" in Portsmouth. Who is involved with Chainrai at the club now? The club announced yesterday that Daniel Azougy \"will no longer be involved with any part of the club\". The statement also highlighted that Peter Storrie, who has been the chief executive throughout this turbulent period, will remain in that position and \"continues to run the club\". Is there any connection between Balram Chainrai, the new owner, and Sacha Gaydamak, the previous owner? There is a connection: Chainrai and his Israeli business partner Levi Kushnir, did a business deal with Gaydamak's father, Arkady, in 2008, which went sour. They successfully sued Arkady in Israel and were awarded around \u00a314.5m. Arkady Gaydamak is a deeply controversial figure; he was convicted by a French court in October of illegal arms trading to Angola in the 1990s and he has also been charged with money laundering in Israel. He has denied guilt for either set of offences and now lives in Moscow. Sacha Gaydamak has always said that his father had nothing to do with the ownership of Portsmouth and Sacha satisfied the Premier League on several occasions that he, Sacha, was the sole owner. Sacha has said it is a coincidence that Chainrai, with whom his father had a dispute, has become involved in Portsmouth. Sacha's advisors said he had not wanted to sell the club to Faraj in the summer partly because he believed Faraj was already connected to Chainrai. An associate of Chainrai told the Guardian on Thursday that Portsmouth came to the businessman's attention after he won the case against Arkady Gaydamak, and he thought a Premier League club would be a good investment. What happens to Portsmouth next? Chainrai has not said he will put further money into the club but that he will seek yet more owners, with the funds to clear the financial crisis. The club said it would be applying to HMRC to adjourn the winding-up hearing scheduled for Wednesday, \"to allow more time for the club to be stabilised and new owners found\". It remains to be seen if HMRC will be willing to accept an adjournment, or the court to order one. If not, and if the club has not paid the outstanding tax, Portsmouth could finally be placed into administration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
