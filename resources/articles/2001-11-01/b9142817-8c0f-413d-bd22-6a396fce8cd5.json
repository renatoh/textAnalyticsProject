Their success was in marked contrast to last year's event which was dominated by American winners. Animated band Gorillaz, fronted by Blur's Damon Albarn, collected two awards. Their single, Clint Eastwood, won best song and the band was named best dance act. In an acceptance speech, Albarn pleaded for a halt to the US bombing of Afghanistan, saying: \"F the music. See this symbol, it's the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong. You've got the voice, use it.\" Increased security accompanied this year's awards amid concerns following the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Several US stars, including Destiny's Child, had cancelled plans to fly to Europe to attend the event. But British comedian Ali G, master of ceremonies, did his best to lighten the mood and Kylie Minogue stole the show with a performance of her recent hit, Can't get you out of my head. The track has been number one in 12 countries across Europe. Williams collected an award for the second year running. In 2000 Rock DJ was named best song. This year he was named best male. David was compensated for coming away empty handed from this year's Brit Awards when he received the prize for best R&amp;B act and best UK &amp; Ireland act. Dido rounded off a year of success by being named best new act. Virtually unknown a year ago her collaboration with US star Eminem catapulted her to stardom. Her album No Angel is the best-selling album of the year so far. US band Limp Bizkit took three awards: best group, best album and best website. Dido collaborator Eminem was named best hit hop. Blink 182 took best rock act and the best video award went to Australian newcomers Avalanches for their track Since I Left You."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
