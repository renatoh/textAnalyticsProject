So they set out to do just that, before they graduate. \u2022 Available on Amazon Prime Video and to rent. The Invisible Man (2020) Writer-director Leigh Whannell created this brilliant thriller, which is also a parable of gaslighting and abuse, inspired by the original HG Wells novel.

Tricksy as all hell in the theatre, it\u2019s still electrifying online. \u2022 Available on NextUp Comedy, paid membership required. James Acaster: Repertoire Why make one comedy special when you can have four? James Acaster does things differently. On stage, where his twisty, superbly constructed sets are like no one else\u2019s.

Frankie Boyle: Excited for You to See and Hate This A cracking hometown 2019 set from the greatest, if most gruesome, political comic of our times, as the New World Order man talks Brexit, international aid, free speech \u2013 and his family history too.
