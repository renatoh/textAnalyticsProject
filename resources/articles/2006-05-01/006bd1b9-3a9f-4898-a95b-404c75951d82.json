He was praised for championing British music, including Elgar and Tippett. Elder, who is conducting the Last Night of the Proms this year and is fast being elevated into a national treasure, beat off competition from Russian-born Vladimir Jurowski, 34, who is next year to take over the helm of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. However, Jurowski was also a winner last night in the opera category, with his Berg's Wozzeck for Welsh National Opera. The opera was the first new production last year in the Wales Millennium Centre. Radio 3's A Bach Christmas took the Creative Communication award in the ceremony at the Dorchester hotel in London. Other nominations had included a webcast by the Philharmonia, the first by a British orchestra. A Bach Christmas, in which every note Bach wrote was broadcast for 10 days, \"opened new potential for radio on a grand scale\", the judges said. In the composition categories, James Dillon won the chamber award for the \"imperishable musical values\" of his String Quartet No 4, while Julian Anderson's large-scale Book of Hours was rewarded for its \"fusion of direct simplicity and delirious complexity\". Graham Sheffield, chairman of the RPS, said the awards \"emphasise that classical music is moving forward fast - engaging with its audiences, developing a new public, and embracing technological advances in concert presentation and communication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
