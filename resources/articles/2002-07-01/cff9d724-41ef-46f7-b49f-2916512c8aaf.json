Nobody practised as many putts on the green behind the grandstands that surround the 18th hole either. But then nobody else had quite as much time to kill as the 30-year-old teaching professional from the Essex golf complex. As first reserve it was Fryatt's lot to spend the day hanging around the area between the practice range and the 1st tee hoping against hope that somebody, anybody, would pull out. \"It would be heartbreaking to be this close if it wasn't so exciting to be here,\" Fryatt said in between hitting his umpteenth basket of balls. \"Obviously you don't want somebody to be injured, but I feel I am playing really well and could get round here no problem. It is a little bit frustrating.\" For Fryatt and his caddie, who was given special dispensation to leave his mobile on so that the starter could find them, it had already been a long day. When it emerged on Wednesday evening that Des Smyth, the 49-year-old Irishman, was struggling with a stiff back and right leg after napping in his car, Fryatt thought he might just have a chance of making it into the tournament proper. Smyth was in the first group out at 7am, so Fryatt and his caddie arrived an hour earlier to hit balls and warm up just in case. They were greeted by the sight of Smyth smashing drives down the range. \"I knew then that the 'impossible dream', as we call it, was probably not going to happen. But you never know, they tell me that one year the reserve made it in with only three groups left to go out, so you have to stick around.\" If he had not been at Muirfield Fryatt, who entered through regional qualifying, would have been playing in the Essex Open (total prize money \u00a32,000). \"Even if you don't make the cut here you earn more than that, but as a reserve you don't get anything. But just for the experience alone it has been worth it. Usually the guy next to me on the range is a 24 handicapper, this week I've hit balls next to Greg Norman and Bernhard Langer. \"And this badge,\" he said, pointing to the competitors emblem pinned to his cap, \"money can't buy you this, it will be on my wall forever. But it's hard to believe I will be playing in the Colchester pro-am next week.\" There is only one thing worse than being first reserve, and that is being second reserve. Yesterday that honour fell to Jon Levitt, a 39-year-old from Pasadena, California, who has been a pro for 15 years and now plays on the Asian and South American tours. \"A slow suffering death,\" is how Levitt, who was standing on the edge of the practice green, described the horror of waiting around for a spot he knew was never going to come. \"I'm not going to get in unless two people either get injured or lost on their way to the course. But I can't leave - imagine how you would feel if you did and then found out later you would have made it?\" But the dream was over for both at 4.36pm precisely, when Trevor Immelman, Jamie Spence and Adam Mednick, the final group of the day, walked off the 1st tee. Levitt picked up his bag, trudged to the car park and headed for Waverely station to get on the night sleeper to London. He had already booked himself on to today's 11am flight out of Heathrow back to California. Meanwhile Fryatt climbed under the yellow rope that separates and swapped his place among golf's elite for a place in the gallery watching Nick Faldo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
