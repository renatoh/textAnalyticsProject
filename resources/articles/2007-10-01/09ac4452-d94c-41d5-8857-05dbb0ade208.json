Probably the most amazing aspect of the tournament was the failure of the favourites - New Zealand - to once again get their hands on the William Webb Ellis Cup. They were the best team coming into this tournament and in likelihood still are the best team. So why were they sitting back in their lounge rooms watching rather than participating in last night's final? Simple, they couldn't handle the pressure that comes with the enormous expectation placed on their shoulders over the past four years. As soon as things started to go wrong in Cardiff against France in the second half, the downward spiral was hard to contain. Someone in the bar where I was watching in Marseille said the New Zealand players looked liked 'haunted men' when the camera zoomed in on Dan Carter and Anton Oliver sitting on the replacements bench, having been taken from the field of play. It was an interesting and astute observation. They knew what was happening, but could do nothing about it. As a team and as individuals they are very rarely in these situations and, when they are, it is a hard position to come back from in sudden-death rugby. Experience is a very good teacher, and when you are the best team for four years you do not have many opportunities to learn about how to play with the momentum against you. Momentum is a deciding factor in sport. If it is at your back it is a very welcome and powerful friend. Come up against it, as the All Blacks and Australia did against France and England, and it is a ferocious opponent that normally defeats you. With the best team knocked out it opened the way for England, who, from a pretty low base admittedly, when they were beaten by South Africa early on, improved all the way to the final. Not by playing any flash rugby, but by dealing with the pressure better than the opposition and believing in their ability to win tight games. It helped that they were able to do this under very little expectation, in stark contrast to the All Blacks. A lot has been said about the merits of Argentina in this tournament. They need to be included in some sort of regular competition, not in the future, but now. The answer does not lie in one of the existing events, although the Six Nations is probably the best suited for this purpose. Let's think laterally about this. Why not create a tournament two years either side of the World Cup, with the first being staged in 2009? The idea would be a northern-hemisphere tournament and a southern-hemisphere tournament that run at the same time. This would give teams such as Argentina, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Japan, United States, Canada, Romania, Portugal and Georgia among others a chance to play in a regular, recognised tournament every two years. The IRB could run it, giving them some more revenue to plough back into these countries along with some intellectual capital - coaching the coaches rather than just throwing money at the issue. I would also like to see the Pacific islands in the Super 14. Not all three of them, but one each year based in New Zealand; somewhere like North Auckland. It would be a floating position occupied by the winner of the annual round-robin play-offs between Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. I think this would add to the tournament and it would give each of these wonderful rugby playing countries something to aim at. While Argentina and the Pacific islands have made great process, this has been because most of their players have benefited from playing in quality competitions such as the Super 14, the English Premiership or the French Championship. While this has improved their current crop of players it has not solved the problem. I see trouble ahead for Italy and Argentina. While their players ply their trade overseas, encouraged by their home federations, it does nothing for the domestic leagues and future development. Look at Italy. Disappointing World Cup, but their performance in the last Six Nations was encouraging. Now compare this to Italian club results in the last Heineken Cup. The top side, Treviso, were beaten by 70 points. This is because there is no emphasis on local competition. They have fallen behind. So once this current group of players retire there is nobody of quality with experience of tough competition to replace them. I predict a lean time ahead for these countries unless something is done - and not just by the IRB, but by the federations who control the individual nations. It has been a great World Cup. One of the best. I can't wait for New Zealand 2011. Let's hope we see all the teams there and in great shape. Along with you - all the supporters who made this World Cup such an enjoyable experience"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
