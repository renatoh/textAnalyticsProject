But six months into the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, even veteran diplomats struggle to mask their horror at the wrecking ball being taken to the country\u2019s nearly two century-old foreign office, known as Itamaraty after the 19th-century Rio palace where it was once housed. \u201cI feel disgusted,\u201d said Rubens Ricupero, Brazil\u2019s former ambassador to the United States and one of the most outspoken critics of the Bolsonarian foreign policy revolution. Since the far-right leader took office in January, his foreign policy team has set about pulverizing decades of diplomatic tradition: cuddling up to rightwing nationalists including Donald Trump, Steve Bannon and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n; irking China, and jettisoning its position as a climate crisis leader; infuriating longtime Middle Eastern partners by embracing Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Israel and threatening to move Brazil\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem. All this under a Bible-bashing pro-Trump foreign minister who claims global heating is a Marxist conspiracy and Nazism is a movement of the left. \u201cI would say it is the most dramatic shift in Brazilian foreign policy in a century,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations specialist from the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo. In interviews with the Guardian, doyens of Brazilian diplomacy described their bewilderment, unease and indignation at seeing such a cherished ministry \u2013 and their country\u2019s place in the world \u2013 turned on its head. \u201cOur current foreign policy takes Brazil back to a period of history at which Brazil didn\u2019t even exist: the Middle Ages,\u201d complained Roberto Abdenur, a former ambassador to China, Germany and the US. Marcos Azambuja, Itamaraty\u2019s former secretary general, said he felt surprised and perplexed by the onset of this new era. \u201cThere has been a change \u2013 and I fear a change for the worse,\u201d said Azambuja, who also served as ambassador in France and Argentina. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine that this could happen.\u201d \u2018Brazil\u2019s lunatic fringe\u2019 The diplomats\u2019 grievances touch on virtually every area of Brazil\u2019s new foreign policy, from Bolsonaro\u2019s excessive entente with Trump, to his hostility to China and the damage his rhetoric has done to Brazilian soft power. Some fret over Bolsonaro\u2019s interference in the affairs of Brazil\u2019s neighbours, such as Argentina \u2013 where he has warned voters not to vote for Cristina Kirchner \u2013 and Venezuela \u2013 where Brazil has championed efforts to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But the objections begin with the people running the show: Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo; the president\u2019s son, Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2013 widely seen as Brazil\u2019s de facto secretary of state; and Olavo de Carvalho, a US-based polemicist of whom both men are disciples. Ricupero claimed the appointment of Ara\u00fajo, a mid-ranking functionary notorious for his eccentric pro-Bolsonaro blogposts, had scandalized Brazil\u2019s diplomatic corps. \u201cWhat I hear from my colleagues who are still active is that among diplomatic staff there is an almost complete rejection of the minister and the current line \u2026 He isn\u2019t taken seriously \u2013 either in or outside the ministry \u2013 because he represents a kind of sect \u2026 that the Americans would call a lunatic fringe,\u201d Ricupero said. There is even greater angst over the role of Eduardo Bolsonaro, a 34-year-old congressman who Steve Bannon recently named the South American frontman for his far-right group The Movement. To the dismay of many diplomats, Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2013 who last year declared Brazil\u2019s foreign service in need of sterilization \u2013 appears even to have offered Bannon a say in policymaking. When Jair Bolsonaro made a state visit to Washington in March, Bannon was invited to dine with him at the Brazilian embassy. \u201cWe are in the perverse, absurd situation of having a foreign citizen influencing Brazil\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Abdenur protested. \u2018Lose-lose diplomacy\u2019 Potential to damage ties with China \u2013 Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2013 is perhaps the subject causing diplomats to lose most sleep. Bolsonaro repeatedly attacked Beijing during last year\u2019s presidential race, and Ara\u00fajo is famed for his dislike of what he calls \u201cMaoist China\u201d. Abdenur, Brazil\u2019s top diplomat in Beijing from 1989 to 1993, warned such antagonism could do \u201cserious harm\u201d to Brazil-China relations. Another major gripe is Bolsonaro\u2019s courtship of Trump. Azambuja said Brazil had traditionally enjoyed \u201cexcellent\u201d ties to the US, even under Bolsonaro\u2019s nemesis, the former leftist president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who cultivated an unlikely bond with George W Bush. But getting too close to Trump\u2019s \u201cradicalism\u201d was unwise. Abdenur said he feared that by embracing other nationalist leaders in Poland and Hungary, Brazil would alienate major European democracies. \u201cWe have nothing to gain from it. We can only lose,\u201d Abdenur said. Finally, there is upset over how Bolsonaro\u2019s radical rhetoric and views on the environment and human rights have damaged Brazil\u2019s international image. In March Bolsonaro reportedly scolded his ambassadors for failing to rid him of his overseas reputation as \u201ca racist, homophobe and dictator\u201d. But Ricupero said that was mission impossible. \u201cNo ambassador can try to alter the reality. Bolsonaro is what he is,\u201d he said. \u2018A mitigation job\u2019 Ricupero said some senior diplomats were battling to limit Bolsonaro\u2019s impact: \u201cThey are trying \u2013 to use the language of climate \u2013 to mitigate, to attenuate the effects. It\u2019s a mitigation job.\u201d Other more moderate administration figures \u2013 crucially the vice-president, Hamilton Mour\u00e3o \u2013 have also been engaged in \u201cdamage containment\u201d. In May Mour\u00e3o flew to Beijing to reassure China\u2019s leaders over the relationship and was received by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. But many in Itamaraty are lying low, fearful of being punished for challenging the Bolsonarian line. Since January, three top-level diplomats who were foreign ministers under the former leftist president Dilma Rousseff have been dispatched to less prestigious posts in Croatia, Cairo and Qatar. \u201cThis is really wrong,\u201d Abdenur said. \u201cIt was never common in Itamaraty for there to be witch-hunts or mass sackings or transfers when governments changed, in order to punish.\u201d Ara\u00fajo and Eduardo Bolsonaro did not respond to interview requests from the Guardian. But both men have publicly celebrated what they call a new, ideology-free foreign policy, particularly its alignment with the US and support for the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. In a speech to newly graduated diplomats last month Ara\u00fajo urged them to heed Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cclarion call\u201d and embrace his push for change \u201cas a profound existential commitment\u201d. \u201cWhat moves us is the simple and profound conviction that what we are doing is right,\u201d a tearful Ara\u00fajo added, before declaring Bolsonaro a Christ-like saviour building a \u201cnew Brazil\u201d. Ricupero, who said he was speaking out in the hope of persuading business leaders to pressure Bolsonaro to moderate his foreign policy, begged to differ. Having joined Itamaraty more than 50 years ago, he felt saddened by the direction his country was now taking \u2013 though not surprised given the \u201cgroup of fanatics\u201d in charge. \u201cI have never had any illusions,\u201d Ricupero said. \u201cI always thought this was a disastrous choice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
