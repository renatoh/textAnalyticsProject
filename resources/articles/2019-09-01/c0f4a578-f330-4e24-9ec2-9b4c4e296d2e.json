It is the first time Huang has spoken about the explosive allegations at the centre of an anti-corruption investigation that have already led to the suspension of the NSW Labor boss Kaila Murnain. Evidence to the state\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption alleges Huang delivered $100,000 cash in an Aldi bag to the then NSW Labor general secretary, Jamie Clements, before a series of straw donors were used to mask the money\u2019s origins. Huang released a statement to the Chinese-language website Sydney Today, denying any knowledge of the cash. He said he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with either the donation or any straw donor. \u201cI am not the source of the alleged donation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI do not know any of the alleged donors of the sum or any of the \u2018straw donors\u2019 as referred to in recent reports, nor have I ever had any contact with them.\u201d In response, Icac chief commissioner, Peter Hall, said the statement would not be considered evidence unless Huang submitted himself to questioning. \u201cThere would need to be compliance by him with the commission\u2019s processes that apply to any witness, which include a preparedness by Mr Huang Xiangmo to submit to any questioning by counsel assisting upon the matters raised by him in his published statement as part of the hearing processes as part of this commission,\u201d Hall said. Huang was denied re-entry into Australia earlier this year amid concerns raised by security agencies. He has been a prolific donor to both major parties and has had long links to Chinese groups in Australia, including the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which is linked to the Chinese Communist party. Sam Dastyari, the federal senator whose career ended over interactions with Huang, has since told the commission that the Chinese billionaire may be an agent of foreign influence. Huang is alleged to have used the $100,000 as payment for seats at Bill Shorten\u2019s table at a March 2015 fundraising dinner in Sydney, hand-delivering the cash to Labor\u2019s headquarters several weeks later. Photos from the dinner show Huang seated next to Shorten, the former NSW Labor leader Luke Foley and the former state MP Ernest Wong. Wong is alleged to have revealed the existence of Huang\u2019s donation to Murnain during a private meeting out the back of state parliament more than a year later, at about 6.45pm on 16 September 2016. Murnain says she talked to Dastyari soon after, who advised her to immediately go and see Labor\u2019s lawyer, Ian Robertson. Murnain alleges Robertson told her to keep quiet about the scandal at a nighttime meeting at his office. Phone records suggest the meeting took place about 7.18pm, leaving at most 33 minutes for Murnain to speak to Dastyari, organise a meeting with Robertson, and get to his office. Robertson\u2019s barrister, Tony McInerney, has called Murnain\u2019s version as a \u201cfabrication\u201d concocted by Murnain to protect herself and explain her failure to act. On Friday, McInerney showed the commission texts and emails showing Murnain was dealing with Robertson on 16 September 2016 about a separate and unrelated issue involving state MP Nick Lalich. He told the commission there was a \u201clikelihood\u201d that Murnain\u2019s meeting with Robertson concerned the Lalich issue, rather than anything to do with Huang\u2019s allegedly unlawful donations. Murnain said she would not have gone to see Robertson about such a routine matter. In his statement, Huang said he had been invited to the dinner as a \u201cleader of the overseas Chinese community\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI was frequently invited to a variety of activities, including that fundraising dinner involved in the inquiry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event organisers invited me not only out of their recognition and respect for me, but also to lend weight to the event so as to further attract attendants.\u201d He suggested \u201creflections\u201d on the political donation system were being used as \u201cammunition in inter- or intra- party fights\u201d. Huang also blamed the media for taking \u201cadvantage of me\u201d, but said it remained his hope and belief that journalists would direct their attention to advocating for donation reform instead. Huang has refused offers to give evidence under oath to Icac via videolink. Internal documents tendered to the commission suggest Shorten\u2019s table at the dinner had been sold for $100,000 and list Huang and his guests as holding the seats. One Labor staffer, Kenrick Cheah, has given evidence that he witnessed Huang attend Labor headquarters several weeks after the dinner to meet with Clements. Clements came out of the office a short time later with a cash-filled Aldi bag. The inquiry continues on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
