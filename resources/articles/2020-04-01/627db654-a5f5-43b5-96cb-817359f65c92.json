Au revoir mes amis! That was, quite simply, the greatest game of football I\u2019ve ever seen and surely one of the greatest games of football ever played, an unstoppable buzz of beauty, joy and love from start to finish. Cherish it, enjoy it, teach it to your children, teach them to teach it to their children; its lovingkindness will endure forever. Hallelujah. So the favourites are out! France will play Germany or Mexico next. That was a great penalty, swept into the side-netting. The French squad go wild and they\u2019ve every right to go wild! I suppose we could say that justice was done, given Carlos\u2019 intervention, but players are allowed to commit fouls, the laws are the to punish them, and Brazil ought to have had the game won by then. Carlos takes his time walking to his line, nudges the ball, and Fernandez promptly sends him the wrong way before haring off like he\u2019s been touched by the hand of God! He has been touched by the hand of God and so have we! What a moment! What a game! What a sport! What a life! He absolutely lamps this, but against the face of the left upright! He\u2019s had a fine game, but really, where was Careca? Where was Silas? It doesn\u2019t matter! If Fernandez scores now, France are into the semis! This is one of the worst, most hilarious penalties you\u2019ll ever see! Platini runs at it straight, looking for the top left, but gets nowhere near! The three greatest players playing in this game have made the greatest rickets! We\u2019re back on serve! Edinho knows the laws, because he\u2019s in the ref\u2019s face setting him straight, then Branco does likewise before whacking centre-left as Bats goes to the right. But Platini scores this next one, France will be nearly there. Bellone runs up fast and whips a left-footer across his body, which hits the post ... then hits the diving Carlos on the curls, and bounces in! The ref gives the goal, but according to the laws, the ball was dead after that post situation! \u201cIt\u2019s like hitting the post in a sense, and going in,\u201d says Motty. Zico runs harder at it this time, and Bats reckons he\u2019ll go the opposite way so dives right, and the ball goes just left of centre. And yes, Motty does say he\u2019s \u201cmaking up for his earlier miss\u201d; of course he does, and of course he isn\u2019t. Amoros, who scored in Seville, sprints, slows, speeds up, and places it just out of Carlos\u2019 reach, to the keeper\u2019s left. Two and half steps, body open, punched into the bottom right, That\u2019s how you do it. Stopyra charges at the ball, cracking a riser more or less down the middle and into the roof, as Carlos dives left. He does exactly what he did against Poland, taking one step like in a five aside game, but Bats either reads his ego or gambles on his ego, hurling himself right and palming the ball away. It wasn\u2019t a terrible penalty \u2013 fair power, not far enough into the corner or high enough when it needed to be one or the other \u2013 but the keeper knew where it was going, so got to it. Well ... this is it. Brazil are going to take first; Socrates is en route to the spot. That was everything we hoped it would be and infinite other things besides. All I can really do is express everlasting gratitude to the players, who did a moving, affirming job, and to the manager, who sent their teams out to attack the game like we should always attacking everything. Obrigardos, merci and bravo. 119 min Amoros chips to the back post, looking for Bossis, but he mistimes his leap. Stopyra retrieves and finds Platini, but the return ball can\u2019t find him, and Julio Cesar brings it away. Except Platini comes back at him, knocks square to Fernandez \u2013 it bounces up nicely \u2013 but he lashes miles high. 119 min France win a free-kick down the right, a few yards away from the box. Everyone piles forward. 118 min Jimmy notes that the ref has had a really good game, which is true. And the reality is that, if Carlos wouldn\u2019t have been sent off, not deeming his foul a foul probably didn\u2019t affect the outcome. But my guess is that after this game, he\u2019ll be on the plane back to ... I\u2019m not sure, does anyone know where he\u2019s from? 117 min You\u2019ve probably and understandably forgotten, but about 40 seconds ago, Carlos brought down Bellone when he was through on an empty goal. And now the France players voice broiges to the ref, but if he didn\u2019t do anything about it then, he certainly won\u2019t do anything about it now. As it goes, Bellone\u2019s touch wasn\u2019t a great one \u2013 he forced himself wide, and wouldn\u2019t necessarily have scored \u2013 bur the laws of the game aren\u2019t right. If you deny a goalscoring opportunity anywhere on the pitch, that should be a penalty; if you commit an offence in the box without denying a goalscoring opportunity, that should be a direct free-kick. Anyway, apologies; I\u2019m lowering the tone. 116 min \u201cThat\u2019s extraordinary!\u201d says Motty of the ref\u2019s ability to adjudge assault, but there\u2019s no more time for moralising because Brazil are breaking! Cesar legs it down the right and finds Silas, infield; he plays into Careca, whose first-time touch-off doesn\u2019t complete the one-two, but instead he chases after the ball, which he wants more than Battiston. Now out on the right, he slows Battiston down, sticks one in behind and barges onto it, riding the desperate recovery tackle before drilling a straight, yet wondrous cross across the face of goal ... and Socrates is right there, unmarked! This for the match! But he misses his kick, nutmegging himself in the process! He had nothing left, falling away even before he tried the shot! I don\u2019t know what to say \u2013 I\u2019ve never, in all my life, seen a football match anything like this and in a way I hope I don\u2019t ever see another football match like this. It should be on the wall in a gallery, on the school curriculum, have its own television channel \u2013 it should have everything, because it is everything. 116 min Here we are. Here - we - are! Bats comes a long way to flap the corner clear, and with Alemao down, France break! Amoros, on the right touchline and midway inside his own half, tucks inside Branco, who expected a pass, then does pass \u2013 infield to Platini. Who, of course, sees him coming, and lazily pets a first-timer in behind the Brazil defence! Bellone is through! This is going to be the longest two seconds of his life! Brace, brace! Carlosfunkel races outside his box, Bellone knocks the ball past him ... and Carlosfunkel schumachers him! He trips, regains his footing ... but can\u2019t catch up with the ball, and Julio Cesar tidies up! On the plus side, Bellone still has his teeth, but even Battiston will agree that is scant consolation when he had the chance to put France into the semi-finals of the World Cup! You\u2019ve got to say, that\u2019s fantastic keeping from Carlosfunkel, making sure he got outside the box to do what had to be done. YOU WHAT! The referee waves play on! I\u2019m not certain he could\u2019ve sent Carlos off, though that was what he deserved - and remember, Brazil have no remaining subs, so he\u2019s also deprived us of an outfield player in net for penalties \u2013 but seeing that and failing to disturb the sound of silence? That is an astonishing piece of behaviour! 116 min Zico pokes wide to Alemao, who has no one front of him so tees himself up for a shot, catapulting everything he\u2019s got into a zooter that Bats tips around the near post. \u201cIt would just be typical for West Germany or the hosts Mexico to knock out one of these dazzling teams in the next round,\u201d says Paul Kellington. 114 min It\u2019s a fair while since we saw Platini. 113 min The corner comes to nothing, but only because, when the ball is half-cleared, Stopyra strays fractionally offside when it comes back in. 111 min Amoros is down clutching his shin. I think he wore one from Alemao after hitting the pass \u2013 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. In the meantime, Edinho bitches to the ref about stopping the game for him to be treated, because his boys have a winner to locate. 111 min We\u2019re back! Careca to Silas to Branco down the left, then Amoros makes another fine challenge before striding away purposefully, launching a fine long pass to Stopyra. But Julio Cesar sticks with him so he goes back to Ferreri, collects a return by the by-line, and digs out a decent cross that Edinho feels obliged to nod behind. 111 min \u201cSo much has happened since, that seems like yesterday,\u201d says Motty of Careca\u2019s goal. That\u2019s a lovely line. 110 min Talking of which, I\u2019m absolutely loving this at the moment. 110 min These lads are bushed now, but Bossis still go-go Gadget legs it forward, only for someone to stray offside. L\u2019ouch. 108 min A quiet minute or two, then Tusseau goes down with cramp. Pathetic. 106 min Right then. Fifteen minutes more, and if there\u2019s no winner, it\u2019s penalties \u2013 which, as we know, are an absolute lottery of a test of skill under pressure. Note: the ref is Romanian. We are in the presence of true, lasting greatness. Bow down. 105 min My shift + 1 is getting a right hammering here! Bats chucks Ferreri into trouble and Branco steams him! He\u2019s got men in the box! But his cross is too close to Bats, who collects easily enough in the end. 105 min The gigantic Alemao battles through a couple of challenges wide on the right then opts to go infield to Josimar rather than cross; Josimar quickly shoves the ball a few yards to Silas, who unfurls a delectable cross for Socrates, in between Amoros and Battiston! But he can only head straight at Bats ... but in fairness he was about 13 yards out ... but either side of Bats and it\u2019s in! 104 min I want a pair of Brazil shorts. 104 min Alemao lays back to Silas, who fights through a challenge on the slide, just outside the box, then Zico takes over and rolls a ball between defenders for Silas. Bats comes rushing out and for a second there\u2019s a penalty chance, or a chance to take the keeper out of the equation, but he plays back to Alemao, who chips over the top. 103 min Brazil come again, Careca pulling wide for Silas, who chucks all of himself into a shot from the left corner of the box \u2013 and it\u2019s a decent one too, sending Bats flying across goal. But it screeches over the bar. 102 min Often, extra-time is tedious, both sides feart of getting beat. Here, absolutely nothing has changed. 101 min Silas finds Socrates, whose first touch is off. Motty chides him for his casualness, but I\u2019d wager the problem is actually that he\u2019s fatigued and has a desire to retire. He consumed an alcoholic beverage 60 minutes ago, and it\u2019s permeated right to his cerebrum. Wherever he may perambulate, on land or sea or atmospheric vapour, you will always hear him chanting this melody, indicate the route to his habitual abode. 100 min France make their second and final change, Bellone replacing Rocheteau. 100 min 41-year-old me has MBM\u2019d hundreds of games, and never had to write anywhere near as many words as here. I need to take on board fluids as a matter of urgency. 99 min Alemao finds Elzo just outside the box, and he screws across a shot the whizzes not that far high. 98 min I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an end-to-end game as unchaotic as this. I\u2019m only seven years and three months old, granted, but I doubt you have either. 96 min Stopyra is up first to attack Ferreri\u2019s corner, but he can\u2019t direct the header. 95 min Tigana turns cleverly in centrefield and finds Ferreri, who immediately lays off for Rocheteau, just outside the circle. Who suddenly stamps on the gas and beats Silas, then sneaks through the tiny gap between Elzo and Alemao with a sensational soft-shoe shuffle, and he\u2019s in! But a slightly heavy touch allows the colossal Julio Cesar to slide in with yet another colossal challenge ... that would have been one of the great goals. But the ball breaks to Stoprya! He drives low and hard, but this time Branco is there to block behind! I want this game tattooed on my eyeballs! 94 min And France immediately launch a counter. In the end, Platini overhits a pass, but the principle is worth preserving. 94 min Brilliant from Silas, nipping a pass into Elzo just outside the box then lanking into it down the right ready to collect a perfect return, diddling Bossis in the process. He then checks, diddling Bossis again, only to roll his square-ball straight to Tigana, in the right place again. I wonder whether, had he and Giresse played their best stuff at the same time, France would have had this game won already. 92 min Alemao plays a one-two with Socrates and crosses, but the (metaphorically) gigantic Tigana is there. The more intense the game has got, the more influential he\u2019s been in it. 92 min Platini\u2019s shirt is so untucked and his shorts are so short is looks like he\u2019s not wearing any. And yes, I definitely would (would\u2019ve done). So would you. 91 min So what do these lads have left? 91 min Of course, if we\u2019re still all-square after extra-time, we will have the second penalty shootout in World Cup history. France lost the first to West Germany four years ago, as you may have heard on the grapevine. 91 min Off we go again. Tele Santana replaces the excellent Junior \u2013 he must be finished - with Silas. What an absolutely gorgeous, astonishing, inspirational game of football that was: artistry, endeavour, aggression, tempo, pace, flow, surprises, drama, and a whole host of other things too. It deserves 30 minutes more \u2013 it deserves canonisation \u2013 and we deserve 30 minutes more of it. And canonisation. 90 min And still they go at it! Careca lobs a ball into the box and no one attacks it, so it bounces into the path of Junior hanging out on its right side. As it bounces across him, his eyes light up, and he can\u2019t help but mash a slice that flies off to wherever. 89 min It\u2019s so gratifying to see both sides giving everything to get a winner, no thought of regrouping for extra time. Maybe it\u2019s just hot and they want to sit down, but more likely they appreciate who they are, where they are, and the people they represent. They have all been awesome. 88 min The first half was high-level, but the second has been celestial \u2013 it\u2019s had everything but a fight. And a goal, but we don\u2019t want that because we\u2019re about to be granted another 30 minutes of this. 86 min Rocheteau slides in Bossis down the left side of the box, and Carlos rushes out \u2013 of course he does \u2013 so the ball\u2019s cut back, somehow eluding both Rocheteau and Stopyra, either of whom would\u2019ve had a keeperless net to shoot at. Instead, Elzo clears, and these two are leaving it all out there. 86 min Credit where it\u2019s due, Brazil have been exceptional after the missed penalty. 85 min Brazil go again, Josimar marauding down the right, digging out a decent cross ... and Zico is up! He twists in mid-air to get bonce around ball, forcing a decent contact, but Bats parries away again. He is having a day! So are we! 84 min Change for France, Ferreri replacing Giresse who, at 33, has understandably tired. He\u2019s still a lovely player though \u2013 his touch, vision and darting passes have been a huge part of this game. 83 min France have played brilliantly, but will be doing well if they make it to extra time. Brazil really ought to have finished this. 82 min Socrates finds Alemao, who spots Careca loitering outside the box. One quick dart into Zico and suddenly he\u2019s bearing down on it, bringing a return that\u2019s deft but sightly behind him into his stride! He\u2019s in! But with only Bats to beat, he doesn\u2019t get enough on his finish! Was that nerves, trying to be too precise? I\u2019m not sure he had time for that, but he was extremely and uncharacteristically tentative. 81 min Elzo finds Careca, who works the ball into the box for Zico but can\u2019t quite bundle his way through a pair of challenges to get off a shot. 79 min I\u2019m a massive fan of Amoros and Bossis ... and there\u2019s the former, driving just wide from 20 yards. Meanwhile in commentary, Jimmy Hill reckons Socrates is knackered and has to be taken off. Thing is, one moment from him and that\u2019s the game settled. 78 min This an absolutely dazzling game of association football, and here\u2019s Fernandez, sliding in on Careca deep inside his own half before setting Amoros away again! He has two men in the middle, and his cross is a fair one, but Carlos keeps his eye on the ball to come and catch, chest-high; any error there, and that was a goal. 77 min Now Bossis charges forward at inside-right, a lovely touch-and-turn taking him past Junior. Now he has Platini to one side, Stopyra to the other ... but he puts his head down and drills a donkey-shot that Carlos dives to push away! The corner comes to nothing. 76 min Now Brazil attack, Socrates finding Junior, who humps his cross behind. 76 min Immediately, France are on the attack, Tigana - who\u2019s been very good in the second half \u2013 finding Giresse, who was very good in the first - but his clever ball doesn\u2019t quite make it to Platini, peeling off down the right side of the box. 76 min Looking again, that penalty was an absolute dog. Weak, poorly directed, an not just telegraphed but advertised. It\u2019s a poor effort. He opens his body and telegraphs where it\u2019s going, which is fine if that\u2019s top bins, but less so when it\u2019s not in the corner and at \u201ca good height for the keeper\u201d, which it is. Bats, whose rashness was the cause of all this, good though the pass was, plunges left and shoves away, then Tigana does enough with loose ball, forcing Careca to knock it behind! The French players mob Bats apart from Platini, who puts a friendly hand on Zico\u2019s neck, who responds with reciprocal waist touch. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re still Zico.\u201d \u201cI appreciate that, because you\u2019re Platini,\u201d elocutes their fingers, but what a moment! If Brazil don\u2019t win here, we\u2019ll be talking about this for as long as talking is a thing! I don\u2019t know, really I don\u2019t! 75 min Here he comes! 74 min Oh my days! They\u2019ve given it to Zico! He\u2019s been on the pitch two minutes, touched the ball once \u2013 but what a touch \u2013 and now he\u2019s got the chance to stick his country in front. It\u2019s a risk, but, well, it\u2019s als Zico. 74 min Socrates places the ball on the spot, walks away, presumably to pace out his run ... but ... but ... surely they\u2019re not going to ... \u201cGive It To Zico!\u201d? 74 min Both Socrates and Careca scored penalties against Poland, Socrates like this. Presumably it\u2019ll be him \u2013 Careca only got a go because he\u2019d already gone off. 74 min Branco is still down, but he\u2019s jubilant now, and Alemao dives on top of him; they embrace. I\u2019m choking up here! And maybe Branco is too, because Almao steps out of full mount and into position for a head and arm triangle! 73 min Fernandez plays a loose ball to Rocheteau and Branco intercepts at speed, zooming over halfway before finding Zico ... AND HAVE A LOOK! With his first touch, he fondles a pass with the outside of his right foot, sticking Branco in, who collects on the edge and beats the advancing Bats in one movement! The keeper, though, is committed to the challenge, and though the ball might well run away, has no option but to clean out his delighted man, who goes down, tries a sneaky look up, isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s coming so goes back down again clutching his leg. But he needn\u2019t worry because the ref points to the spot! 73 min France get the corner away at the third time of asking. 72 min Anyone else bang into this at the moment? Your Harlequins and Columbines, your Return to Ozes, your Gobbolinos and your Little Wooden Horses... ...and, of course, your... Not much I\u2019d not do to or for those boots. 72 min Tele Santana has seen enough! After Brazil win another corner, he reaches into his toolbox and sends on Zico for Muller. 71 min Of course they do! Socrates strokes lazily out to Josimar, who hangs up a cross; Bossis is underneath it, but Careca has a run on him and absolutely cleanses him in the air, smashing a header against the face of the bar! This is punishing, unrelenting, joyous beauty! 70 min Platini lifts one from centre to left, seeking Tusseau, but Julio Cesar, who\u2019s been excellent again, waves a head in the road and Brazil get it away. 70 min Fernandez into Platini, who arcs another fine return pass as his mate continues his run, but Branco does really well to read and intercept. The one and two-touch stuff between the points of the carr\u00e9 magic is so, so good. \u201cEvening Daniel,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cPlatini is 31 today, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get many more cracks at the World Cup, as a player anyway. He\u2019s bound to manage France one day, though his demeanour seems better suited to football administration if you ask me. FIFA and/or UEFA could do with someone like him, if the rumours are anything to go by...\u201d 68 min Amoros gets forward \u2013 like Branco, he\u2019s been much more ambitious since half-time \u2013 but Elzo beats him to the ball, finding Careca out on the left touchline. He runs at Tigana, who has the longest legs of any short person I\u2019ve ever seen, and they do their job yet again. 67 min Careca heads the corner over the top, as Zico and Silas strip. 67 min Brazil are still at it, Elzo finding Muller, who might go at his man but picks the righteously cream-crackered options, driving a tired cross that\u2019s blocked behind. 66 min The ground shows the players suitable appreciation. They\u2019ll be telling their mates, their kids, their grandkids and the bus driver\u2019s socks that they were here today, and need to make sure they wring every last drop of pleasure out of this, because in roughly 34 years\u2019 time, people are still going be raving about what\u2019s unfolding in front of them. 66 min What are we seeing! These are four of the greatest minutes I\u2019ve ever seen! Brazil come right back at France, Socrates taking possession off Alemao and firing into \u2013 against \u2013 Muller, who lays off first-time for Alemao. He clips to the edge of the box, where Socrates chests down and tees up the advancing Junior, who takes a touch then unleashes a further rising rasper, which Bats leaps to parry! This is a game. This is the game. 65 min Oh really! Socrates is on his heels when Edinho plays out, so Tigana, all legs and aggression, burgles him, picking a clever short pass into Rocheteau, who just needs to lay it back ... which he does. Even though he has to reach behind him, Tigana is on the burst now, picking a brilliant line to run and marrying it with a perfect touch which takes him past Julio Cesar and into the box, no defender within five yards of him! But instead of shooting immediately, he feints, Carlos doesn\u2019t buy it, and by the time he catches up with a slightly heavy touch, the keeper is right up in his grille to block the eventual effort, then Cesar flings himself at the loose ball ahead of Platini. Phew! The players must be properly hurting; well, they should try liveblogging. 65 min This has picked up again! Platini is first to Bats\u2019 goalkick, holding off Elzo and bundling through Josimar, allowing Rocheteau to pounce on the loose ball. He drives forward, accelerating away from Josimar, and looks to slide in Stopyra, but Edinho reads him and steps in to intercept. 65 min Amoros crosses to Stopyra, but a gigantic header from Julio Cesar puts paid to it then Junior touches back to Branco. Just on the corner of his own box, he suddenly sets off on a weaving run, moving infield then, seeing no one bothers to challenge, around Bossis, over halfway, and what on earth is going on?! He comes back inside, then as Tigana shapes to tackle, veers outside, diddles Bossis again, and suddenly he\u2019s in a crossing position! He chips nicely too, but to no one, and after all that, France clear. Get that man some o2! 64 min Bit more pressure from Brazil, Alemao faking a shot then moving towards the French box and finding Josimar. His cross is eventually turned by Socrates to Muller, who lashes a shot miles away from anywhere \u2013 the ball lands somewhere in the region of Selhurst Park. Der Bomber, after whom he was named, might have done better, but might also not have ventured 15 yards from goal, never mind beyond the width of the posts. 62 min But here come the men already out there, Socrates running onto a short pass from Alemao in the centre-circle; with a lazy first time wipe of foot across ball, he coaxes a terrific pass from centre to left and beautifully into the stride of Muller. Muller takes a touch, looks up, and arcs a fine cross into the corridor of uncertainty ... Careca is bearing down at the far post, but someone, Tusseau I think, does superbly to get between him and it, winning a free-kick in the process. 61 min Activity on the Brazil bench, with Silas warming up. Oh, go on then; and Zico. 61 min Brazil don\u2019t clear the corner properly and the ball drops to Platini, who dribbles a shot wide. 60 min Nice from France, Giresse spraying wide to Stopyra, who looks up and sees Platini on the edge, rolling him in ... here we go ... it\u2019s his birthday you know ... and he catches this, but Elzo sticks himself in the road and the ball goes behind. 59 min Brazil are finding it harder to find space this half \u2013 France are defending slightly deeper I think, and still managing to work the ball forward when they have it. 57 min Branco is getting forward far more often this half, and he incurs again, then finds Alemao who shifts the ball across his body and across the face of the box seeking a shooting angle. But the best one he had was the first one, and his eventual effort trundles wide of the far post. 56 min The free-kick goes wide to Bossis, who crosses for Stopyra ... and he climbs over Edinho, but can only direct the ball over the top, to his intense consternation. 55 min Junior nails Stopyra with a lovely gentle touch on the back of the achilles, just enough to trip him, not enough to hurt him \u2013 these Brazilians are so deft. Free-kick France, 30 yards out, well right of centre, and still no booking in the game \u2013 but we\u2019ve got time. 54 min Branco eases forward and finds Socrates ... who shoots from 25 yards, falling, and the ball flies over. Meanwhile, Tigana gives out to Platini for not tracking, clearly underestimating the football intelligence that told him Socrates would miss. 53 min Platini\u2019s football intelligence is immense. Even when he doesn\u2019t execute effectively, he\u2019s always in the right place to collect the ball and almost always picks the right option thereafter. Here, Rocheteau allows one to run across his body and obviously his captain is there, but the return doesn\u2019t quite get back to him. 53 min Platini\u2019s shirts hangs lusciously over his shorts, as Motty explains to us the meaning of the word \u201cnutmeg\u201d. He really is extraordinarily benevolent. 52 min Julio Cesar goes galumphing forward down the right wing while Josimar and Muller combine, but the ball towards him runs away. 52 min Eeesh! France knock it about in midfield, then Amoros lumps a hopeful one into the box and no defender attacks it, so Stopyra jumps and the ball bounces off his foot for Rocheteau; it\u2019s behind him and Branco is in the road, but he digs out a shot on the turn ... that slides a foot or two wide. 51 min Junior\u2019s corner is headed away by the first man, but he collects the loose ball and clips a clever reverse-pass in behind the defence that Muller runs onto. His cross, though, is wellied way beyond anyone. 50 min ...no he won\u2019t! He bends a shot hard and flat, another fair effort but another one straight at Bats, who flicks it around the far post. 49 min Brazil are in the half now, moving the ball across midfield after Alemao chases Fernandez \u2013 brave, brave move given how hot it is out there \u2013 and Muller wins a free-kick, then Branco buys one off Bossis down the left, between touchline and box. Scorates will stick it into the middle... 48 min Motty notes that, as opposed to four years ago, Brazil have two more defensively-minded midfielders in Alemao and Elzo, rather than Falcao, Zico, Eder and Socrates all creating worlds and dropping bombs. But here\u2019s Junior, who\u2019s been excellent so far, taking a short pass from Elzo between centre-circle and penalty box, advancing ... and absolutely lamping a shot from 30 yards that screeches and hisses towards goal, but because it\u2019s straight at him, Bats is able to punch clear. 48 min Brazil have barely had a kick so far this half, and look at that, Tigana into Platini in centrefield, who improvises a tasty back-flick to Giresse. It didn\u2019t quite reach him, but it wasn\u2019t far off and illustrates the verve and confidence with which France are playing. 47 min Wondering if Josimar ought to have been booked for \u201cquite a severe tackle from behind\u201d, Jimmy Hill notes that tomorrow night\u2019s Argentina-England tussle will be reffed by a Tunisian. \u201cHe may be the most brilliant referee in the world and I\u2019m being unkind to him, but I know it\u2019s caused a certain amount of unease around this area.\u201d I believe they call this projection, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine \u2013 I absolutely trust him to ignore a succession of murderous assaults on Maradona. 46 min Bit of possession for France, before Josimar ploughs through Battiston. He has a little lie down, but will be fine. 46 min Rocheteau and Platini set us away again. For those watching in black and white, Brazil are in the yellow shirts; for those listening on the radio, France are playing from right to left, unless you\u2019re listening on the radio sat on the other side of the stadium. Right then. Eyes down for more magnificence. \u201cThat is the problem with modern football,\u201d says Matthew. \u201cIt never occurred to me in 34 years that Careca\u2019s goal might have been offside at any point. Now it would be VARd to hell and even if allowed to stand, so much momentum would be sucked out of the occasion.\u201d It\u2019s tricky. I never wanted var and still don\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t fall in love with football because of the accuracy of refereeing decisions \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to complain when we get the correct one, provided it doesn\u2019t take too long. I\u2019d still prefer it to go, at least until the players are fitted with lasers so offside decisions are as quick as the goalline ones. Half time adverts: yes, I know this game is on BBC, but let\u2019s pretend that it isn\u2019t. See you in 15. An important half-time message from the future, from @CentrepointUK: As everyone knows, the impact of COVID-19 is huge, and inescapable for us all. But for young people experiencing homelessness, it is even more devastating. That is why it is important to support charities like @CentrepointUK. Right now, whilst they are unable to deliver their usual Engagement programmes, they are launching exciting challenges every Friday for people to take on. This week\u2019s can be found by clicking here, and the more people who take part, the more everyone can come together and help young people remain engaged, active and connected during this difficult period. Please do get involved, and please do use these hashtags. Thanks! #CentrepointChallengeAccepted #CentrepointAppeal That was an absolutely glorious half of ... wait for it ... \u201cWorld Cup football\u201d. France are so dangerous when they get it together in midfield, while Brazil are electric around the box and on the counter \u2013 the match-up is perfect, with both sides looking to get forward as soon as they take possession. I cannot wait for whatever\u2019s coming next. 44 min It took roughly 400 minutes for Carlos to concede a goal in this World Cup, notwithstanding this effort from Michel in Brazil\u2019s first game, which crossed the line. Quite what El Buitre was doing not nodding home to make sure, I do not know, given the ball was, in theory, dead. 43 min France go straight back after it, Rocheteau looking for Stopyra, but the excellent Julio Cesar intervenes. 42 min Platini has scored 95 goals in his four seasons at Juventus \u2013 from midfield, in the most parsimonious league that has ever been. He\u2019s a joke (currently of the good kind). But the ref \u2013 who\u2019s from Romania \u2013 missed seeing who scored, so Platini had to show him his back. Maybe he might also have recognised his front. Bien s\u00fbr! Amoros, who\u2019s done really well down the right, collects from the excellent Giresse and punches a pass back into him; his first-timer sticks Rocheteau in behind Branco! He does his best to swivel into a dug-out cross with his weaker foot, which clips someone \u2013 Edinho I think \u2013 and Stopyra tosses his whole self into a diving header as Carlos flies at it too. Both miss, leaving both in a heap, and there\u2019s Platini \u2013 it\u2019s his birthday, you know! \u2013 at the back post to run it in! 40 min The corner is rubbish, floated towards Stopyra 15 yards out, and his head loops over the top. The ref is Romanian, by the way. 40 min Platini, given time and space outside the box, flights a pass over the top for Amoros, arriving down the right, and his cross is immediately blocked behind by Edinho. 39 min Lovely from Junior, sending Tusseau for a burrito and evading another challenge, but his clip back across for Socrates is intercepted. 37 min Tigana weaves by Junior, so Socrates trips him; free-kick France, 35 yards out. Amoros is going to shoot you know, and he catches it nicely too, but it cannons Junior\u2019s head. Rather you than me, old mate. \u201cMuller scores there and another 4-0 could\u2019ve been on the cards,\u201d tweets Matthew. \u201cA turning point?\u201d France are playing to well to get gubbed, I think, but it would\u2019ve been a long way back. 36 min It\u2019s not hard to envisage France scoring, but it\u2019s equally not hard to envisage Brazil scoring again. 35 min France win a free-kick just outside the box, just right of the D, similar to the position from which Tusseau wasted the last one. It\u2019s Platini\u2019s birthday \u2013 did you know? \u2013 and he curls into the wall. 34 min Brazil are so dangerous on the counter. Muller and Careca aren\u2019t coming back at all, and there\u2019s a limit to how many men France, chasing an equaliser, can afford to leave on them. 33 min But have a look! Brazil work the ball away and Socrates perambulates through the vacated midfield, wedging a glorious pass from in to out, finding Careca at inside-left. Bossis is there but isolated ... and Careca pokes past then skates around him, rolling across the face of goal for the arriving Muller, who, from a tight angle and facing towards the corner flag, snaps a fine shot against the base of the near post! Another sensational move from Brazil, petting the ball from one end to the other with such louche joy. 32 min France had a quiet period after going behind but they\u2019re warming right back up ... and here are Tigana, Giresse and Platini combining in centrefield. Nothing comes of it, but you get the feeling they\u2019ll pick their way through eventually. 31 min Tigana finds Platini, who moves right and takes the ball back, moving it back inside to Platini, who cushions a first-time volleyed pass for Giresse, who heads into the box for Stopyra ... who can\u2019t reach it, Josimar intercepting. Both these teams are playing with such touch and imagination! 30 min A long ball frees Careca down the left side of the box, close to the line, and he flicks it back across Bossis ... did that hit a hand! The Brazilians think so, but the ref says not and the slowmotion replay says you should\u2019ve seen it first time. 30 min Stopyra holds up and slides Rocheteau the ball once he makes an angle. He screws a returns pass, but it\u2019s too far in front and Branco mops up with a backpass. 29 min Brazil look so smooth and confident in possession. 28 min Cesar batters the ball 60 yards down the park for Muller to chase. Somewhere in Lancashire, Sam Allardyce takes notes and points double guns at himself in the nearest mirror. 27 min Julio Cesar heads the corner behind for another, which Brazil get away. 26 min But here they come now! Amoros into Tigana, to Giresse ... and back out to Amoros, the pass beautifully weighted into his stride. His driven low cross is a decent one too, Rocheteau attacking the near post! But Carlos, laying low, does just enough and Cesar boots behind with Stopyra on his heels. Ly la ly, ly la la la ly ly. Ly la ly, ly la la la la ly la la ly. Carlos took a boot to the elbow in all that, so takes a moment to receive treatment while other players drink from water bags. 24 min It\u2019s been a while since France constructed a move of note. \u201cAmazing goal,\u201d tweets Matthew. \u201cAnd Josimar was about third-choice going into the tournament, I don\u2019t think anybody in Europe had ever heard of him! Ultimate window player, brilliant for two weeks then disappeared. Linked with Dundee United around the time of the UEFA Cup Final, amazingly.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s a sad story all-in. 22 min This game is end-to-end, but not in the usual way. The teams are playing their way forward and progressing because they pass, move and inject pace beautifully, not because no one\u2019s arsed to employ any discipline. It\u2019s already great, and it\u2019s getting better. 21 min Lovely from Tigana, who feints inside and lanks outside, the ball eventually making its way to Giresse, who leathers over the top. Jimmy somehow makes it about England, but with a sensible comment about the efficacy of third-man runs into the box. 19 min Giresse pings one towards Platini, who Josimar does well to beat in the air. 19 min Socrates lifts a lovely ball out to Branco, who runs onto it on a burst which takes him past Fernandez. But his cross is straight into Amoros and France bring the ball away. 19 min Jimmy says that before the tournament, people were writing Brazil off ... but not him. Clever Jim! 18 min Careca now has five goals in the competition \u2013 as many as Lineker and Butragueno, who previously led the way. This is why we\u2019re here! Julio Cesar meets Bats\u2019 goalkick with a colossal header, controlled on the chest by Josimar, who turns and feeds Socrates on halfway, out on the right. He takes a touch, exudes epochal cool, and finds Alemao, who spreads back out to Josimar; he coaxes a lazy-looking pass into Muller, who tips a yard to Junior, takes the instareturn, squares back to Junior and Brazil, now on the edge of the box, have a man - a Careca \u2013 over! Junior caresses to him with perfect timing, he opens his body, and absolutely clatters a finish high past Bats into the net. That is an unbelievably, joyously, inspirationally brilliant goal! 16 min Motty notes that the only goal conceded by France so far was this jazzer. Rats is an extremely amusing name, if you\u2019re seven years and three months old, all the more so when he scores past Bats. 16 min Brazil are coming! Junior swipes a first-time ball into Socrates, who cushions on the volley \u2013 that is gorgeous \u2013 teeing up for Muller, who drags his shot from distance straight at Bats. 16 min The corner comes to nowt. 15 min Muller pulls right again and knocks infield to Careca, whose adroit turn away from the centre opens up space for Socrates, bursting into it! The ball is duly delivered into his stride, and he takes a touch, then leathers a shot that Bats blocks ... and when Careca returns the ball into the box, Bats is out again to concede a corner. That\u2019s our first proper chance, foiled by decent keeping, but really that should\u2019ve been your David Coleman. 14 min Junior swipes across the ball, sending it out right to Muller in a lovely parabola, but the excellent Amoros is there to block him off. 12 min Excellent from Junior, turning up in front of the back four to rob Giresse then blazing forward before finding Careca. Ahead of him, Muller looks to create space, as a decoy or for a pass, but Careca opts for a dig, which actually clips his mate on its way back to Bats. 12 min Socrates plays football like a supermodel does runway, strutting haughty and tall \u2013 with good reason. He reminds me of me in penny-floater Wembley doubles earlier this afternoon. 11 min Amoros, who\u2019s an absolute player, strides forward again and he\u2019s clearly noticed that Carlos is dodge, drilling another low shot from distance that\u2019s saved \u2013 but not at the first time of asking. 11 min ...but Tusseau takes it off him, whacking directly into the wall. 10 min Platini and Giresse\u2019s understanding is brilliant, and another give and go sees the former meg Alemao; Cesar comes in, but the ball rattles between Tigana, Rocheteau and Giresse again, before Junior trips him, playground-style. Free-kick France, 25 yards out, right of centre. Platini will fancy this... 10 min \u201cThey appreciate their football here in Guadalajara,\u201d says Motty, renowned Mexicologist \u2013 though not, of course, as acclaimed as Norman Whiteside and Bryan Robson. \u201cSocrates back heels, Dunga would be furious!\u201d says Matthew. I\u2019d loved to have seen him take it up with him. 9 min Both sides are looking to go forward the moment they get the ball, Brazil at a more leisurely pace than France, whose style is more direct but equally aesthetic. 8 min Bossis turns cleverly in midfield and finds Platini, who\u2019s in the mood; of course he is. He easily wriggles past the first challenge, then drives from distance into the nearest midriff. 8 min Fernandez is limping, but carries on for the time being. 8 min Brazil sustain their attack and Josimar looks to burst into the box, but Bossis gets in the road. 7 min Here come Brazil, flowing through midfield with Socrates, Elzo and Careca, who finds Socrates again and collects the backheel return. But France do well to close down the passing lanes, forcing the ball wide before it comes back in and Junior falls over it. We\u2019re cooking. 7 min There\u2019s a good racket from the Brazilians in the crowd as France attack again, Giresse not quite able to make a return pass from Platini. 7 min This is a very promising start. Neither of these are waiting to be asked. 6 min First link-up between Muller and Careca, the former winning a header and making for the one-touch return, which is intercepted by Battiston. That didn\u2019t work, but looked nice; Careca is a proper player. 6 min France are moving the ball quicker than Brazil, and with Tusseau on one touchline and Fernandez on the other \u2013 they\u2019re playing three at the back, I think \u2013 they\u2019re stretching the game, forcing Brazil to run about. 5 min \u201cFirst blood to the French,\u201d says Jimmy Hill in co-commentary, just letting us know he\u2019s there. 5 min Josimar burrows forwards and finds Alemao \u2013 his nickname means German, because he\u2019s blonde and fair like all Germans \u2013 who larrups a shot high over the bar. 5 min Mentions of the referee\u2019s Romanianness: two and counting. 4 min Oh yes! Platini, inside his own half, central, digs out a frankly pornographic long ball, sent over Cesar\u2019s head towards Stopyra down the left. It goes back to Tigana who finds Tusseau \u2013 he seems to man-marking Socrates \u2013 and nothing comes of it. But France are into this now, as one might be. 4 min No one\u2019s managed it yet, but a decent attack should manage to score against this Brazil defence. 3 min Platini collects Julio Cesar\u2019s header and plays a wall-pass off Giresse, shimmying past Alemao on the edge of the box! He looks to make room for a shot, but Cesar strong-stands to see him away ... but have a look! Josimar\u2019s clearance is blocked, Platini sneaks up behind him and pokes back to Amoros ... and he leathers a left-footed drive that ruffles Carlos\u2019 side-netting in roughly the same manner as I\u2019d like to do to his Art Garfunkel hair. \u201cFoul on Junior. Just jealous he\u2019s gonna make a record with Kim Wilde, I suppose...\u201d tweets Matthew. 2 min Josimar fouls Amoros, giving France the chance to stick one in le mix\u00e9r, but the kick flies well past Stopyra and out for a throw. 2 min What\u2019s the spread on the number of times Motty reminds us that it\u2019s Platini\u2019s birthday? I\u2019m on 520-613. 1 min Brazil knock it about at leisurely pace, their fans banging out some heavy beats, before Fernandez, le r\u00e9ducteur, piles through Junior. Everyone\u2019s fine. 1 min Brazil get us underway, and this is, I think, my favourite rendition of their gear. The floppy collar makes me hot under mine. \u201cCould we even have penalties today?\u201d wonders John Motson \u2013 unlikely, given in the entire history of the World Cup that\u2019s only happened once before. And it\u2019s extremely hot out there \u2013 my body is convulsing at the mere thought. Right then, it\u2019s off to Guadalajara with us! You can watch coverage of the game here. As for France, Michel Platini becomes the first man to play \u201cWorld Cup-football\u201d on his birthday for a second time. Last time, he did this... Some notes: Brazil are the only country to have appeared in all 13 World Cup tournaments so far, losing just 10 times in that time. In 24 qualifying games, they have never been beaten \u2013 that\u2019s now the longest operative sequence, as West Germany\u2019s run of 31 ended with defeat by Portugal in November 1985. Other records include the three longest unbeaten sequences in tournament history: 13 games between 1958 and 1966; 11 between 1970 and 1974; 11 between 1978 and 1982. And they were fantastic in dismantling Poland just last week. Frisson:strides interface. I would happily be called any of these names. And it\u2019s not just this game! Later today comes West Germany v Mexico, then tomorrow we\u2019ve got the small matter of Argentina v England and Spain v Belgium. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been said before, but I really fancy England to go all the way this time and end 20 years of hurt; if anyone can do a job on Maradona, Terry Fenwick can do a job on Maradona. An omen: this is currently top of the UK hit parade. A further omen: I\u2019ve got a funny feeling this is going to succeed it next Sunday. In other words: this is going be a religious, celestial experience. Thank you science. For those of you who\u2019ve invented the internet already, you can watch along here: So Brazil are unchanged from their 4-0 hiding of Poland, because why should they make special plans for a side as good as France? Exactly. And why should France make special plans for a side as good as Brazil? Exactly. They make one alteration, Tusseau replacing the suspended Ayache; seven of these started their 1982 defeat to West Germany in Seville. Brazil (a relaxed 4-4-1-1): Carlos; Josimar, Edinho, Julio Cesar, Branco; Elzo, Alem\u00e3o, Socrates, Junior; Muller; Careca. Subs: Paulo Vitor, Leao, Edson, Oscar, Mauro Galvao, Falcao, Zico, Silas, Valdo, Casagrande, Edivaldo. France (a flexible 4-4-2): Bats; Amoros, Battiston, Bossis, Tusseau; Fernandez, Giresse, Tigana, Platini; Rocheteau, Stopyra. Subs: Bergeroo, Rust, Ayache, Bibard, Le Roux, Ferreri, Genghini, Vercruysse, Bellone, Papin, Xuereb. Man Jimmy Hill likes to say we\u2019re hoping not to notice: Ioan Igna (Romania) For those of you making your World Cup debuts aged 7 years and three months, this is the game. Obviously you\u2019ve lapped up everything you\u2019ve been allowed to lap up, but this is the one: the one your dad plonks you in front of, as though he needed to, and says \u201cThis \u2013 this \u2013 this \u2013 is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d We\u2019re all friends here, so we can be be honest: if it turns out to be a stinker, there\u2019ll be joy to be had in the aftermath, winding him up. But it\u2019ll be small compensation because this needs to be magic. The world is depending on it. Football is a hard, nasty, vicious, visceral endeavour, and that\u2019s a large part of why we love it so much. But this contretemps \u2013 this rev\u00e9s \u2013 which has the potential to be extremely special \u2013 will be no such thing. It\u2019s a funny old game, Saint, Santo. Performing for our delectation we have two of the most beautiful teams ever, wearing two of the most beautiful kits ever, exuding two of the coolest cools ever, with a place in the World Cup semi-finals at stake. Anyone who claims to know what\u2019s going to happen is a liar. Brazil, the only team left in the competition with a 100 percent record, eased through their group and were dazzling in caning Poland last week \u2013 so far they have scored nine and conceded none. It\u2019s true that Socrates is slowing, Eder has gone, Falcao is going and Zico is ailing, but they now have midfield ballast and Careca instead of Serginho. He already has four goals to his name, while the boy Josimar is flying. Roughly, os meninos podem brincar. France, meanwhile, started slowly but hammered Hungary in their final group game before seeing off Italy in the last 16. Though this is surely its last stand, the carr\u00e9 magic which carried them to the European Championship remains intact; in front of it, there remains no serious striker, but behind it Manuel Amoros has strengthened the defence. Roughly, les gar\u00e7ons peuvent jouer. Kick-off: 12pm CST, 6pm BST 1986, 7.45pm BST 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
