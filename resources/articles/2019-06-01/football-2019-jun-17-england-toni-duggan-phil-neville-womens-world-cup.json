Although the Lionesses\u2019 much-vaunted stylistic evolution still has some way to go before it can be described as \u201cPhil-tastic\u201d, Barcelona\u2019s Duggan is not alone in drawing comparisons between the pair\u2019s philosophies. As she perches on a stool on a hotel terrace overlooking a vertiginous Proven\u00e7al hillside close to the medieval town of Valbonne, the former Manchester City forward is asked how far Guardiola\u2019s legacy has permeated beyond the Camp Nou and the Etihad. \u201cAt Barcelona all men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams have the same style and philosophy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly doing rondos [possession-based training exercises] and it\u2019s the same with Phil\u2019s England. It\u2019s the same football language. \u201c Barcelona have been playing out from the back since they were babies and we\u2019re not far behind now. That\u2019s the way Phil wants to play. He\u2019s lived in Spain so he\u2019s probably robbed a few ideas from Valencia.\u201d Wednesday\u2019sgame in Nice against a Japan side big on sharp passing and rapid movement \u2013 when a draw will be sufficient for England to finish top of Group D and a newly fit Duggan could start \u2013 promises to road-test the practicalities of Neville\u2019s blueprint. It should serve as a marker illustrating the precise depth and scale of the Lionesses\u2019 recent metamorphosis. \u201cWe were super successful under Mark [Sampson] because we were so direct and played to people\u2019s strengths,\u201d says Duggan, a key component of the squads that reached the semi-finals of Canada 2015 and Euro 2017. \u201cBut Phil\u2019s come in with his philosophy; football\u2019s transitioning and everyone\u2019s trying to play out from the back now.\u201d Following fashion is all very well \u2013 and, in a football context, sometimes necessary \u2013 but Duggan appreciates that a certain compromise is also called for. \u201cIn Spain they\u2019re never direct and that frustrates me,\u201d she says. \u201cSo Phil\u2019s philosophy doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re never going to do a long ball; we have great players who can run in behind at great pace. It\u2019s about finding that balance and analysing the opposition\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\u201d During her City days she became intrigued by Guardiola. \u201cI\u2019m interested in him a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I met him I just thought he was a lovely person, a real gentleman. \u201c Every club has legends and at Barcelona Cruyff and Pep are going to be spoken about forever; knowing what they\u2019ve achieved and in what style.\u201d Some long-standing England watchers suspect the degree of Guardiola-esque tactical change has been exaggerated under Neville while others fear they are taking too many risks passing sideways at the back. Neville remains evangelical about his revolution. \u201cWe work on sequences of six, seven, eight, nine passes, which means you control games,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut in the second half against Scotland [a 2-1 win] we started playing walking, standstill football, got sloppy and our pass count dropped.\u201d He was happier with the 1-0 victory against Argentina when his centre-backs, Steph Houghton and Abbie McManus, completed more passes than all the opposition players put together. \u201cWe went from side to side, back, forward,\u201d says McManus, who has just swapped Manchester City for Manchester United. \u201cThe more times we went sideways, the more gaps started appearing. It\u2019s the way I\u2019ve played at City where the coach, Nick Cushing, speaks to Pep quite a lot and they\u2019ve tried to put the men\u2019s coaching style into the women\u2019s teams.\u201d After recovering from a shoulder injury Millie Bright is likely to be challenging McManus for a starting place against Japan and, as she takes her seat on a terrace with stunning views tumbling down towards the Mediterranean, the Chelsea defender is similarly on message. \u201cThe players prefer this new style,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to be on the ball, passing and being confident and brave. But you have to be able to read the game and your options vary depending on if the opponents does low block, mid-block or press. It\u2019s about always making sure you\u2019ve got an outlet. \u201cPhil\u2019s always saying we\u2019ve got to be brave. You\u2019ll never be punished for losing the ball because he wants you to keep getting on it, and the only way to improve is to keep doing it repetitively.\u201d Guardiola would surely approve. \u201cAt City you\u2019d see Pep chewing someone\u2019s ear off about football and think: \u2018wow\u2019 I\u2019d love to ask a question but I\u2019d probably be there for a week,\u201d says Duggan. \u201cOnce I was doing some extra running - you might be surprised about that - and he came and stood watching me. I was knackered. I was like, \u2018oh, bloody hell, do I stop? Shake his hand? Carry on and pretend that I can\u2019t see Pep Guardiola\u2019? I went to stop and he was, \u2018no, no - continue\u2019. I thought \u2018oh my God\u2019. I did about two shuttles and then he walked away; I was like, \u2018wow, thank God\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
