Betty Thompson, director of the Jackson Women's Health Organization, said they were \"temporarily relieved\" by the news. Thompson said the clinic had been given time to find out if the hospitals would grant the its doctors admitting privileges \u2013 one of the key requirements of the new law. But she added: \"We are in limbo. We don't know how long it will last.\" Judge Daniel Jordan, from the US district of Mississippi, extended the order he issued 10 days ago which temporarily blocked the enforcement of the new law, but he did not give a deadline for the extension. He has not yet ruled on whether the new law is unconstitutional. Michelle Movahed, attorney for Center for Reproductive Rights, which is bringing the case on behalf of the clinic, said: \"We asked for the law to be stopped from coming into effect so that the clinic and the doctors could continue work with patients without the risk of penalties for not complying with it now.\" The state law, passed in April, would require anyone performing abortions to be an registered obstietrician-gynecologist with privileges to admit patients to a local hospital. Doctors at the clinic in Jackson do not have those privileges and the clinic says the privileges are not medically necessary. Such privileges are also difficult to obtain for abortion doctors in a state where many hospitals are affiliated with churches. The governor, Phil Bryant, and other Mississippi lawmakers have said that such privileges are necessary for the safety of patients. They have also openly stated that their purpose is to eliminate abortion in the state, a point made by the judge in his initial ruling on the case. Attorneys for the clinic said that it has one doctor with admitting privileges but that the doctor cannot perform all abortions, according to Jackson Free Press. Two-thirds of Mississippi women, therefore, would not have access to the constitutionally protected practice. They also said that, since Jordan's injunction on 1 July, no backers of the law had denied that is was about ending abortion in Mississippi. The US supreme court has ruled that states may not place undue burdens or substantial obstacles to women seeking abortion. A key argument in the case was whether doctors for the clinic are able to obtain admitting privileges. The clinic says it has been unable to obtain admitting privileges for its physicians who are from outside Mississippi, a legacy of the threats and harassment received by those associated with abortion in the state. The judge said the case was unique because no-one knew whether the doctors would succeed in obtaining the required privileges. The clinic said it would face \"irreparable harm\" if the law were to be enforced because hospitals have not said either when or if they will consider the admitting privileges. The clinic wanted the judge to keep the law on hold to see if its doctors can get the privileges. \"If they're denied or if the hospitals are dragging their feet, that's going to be more clear evidence that there's a substantial obstacle\" to an abortion, clinic attorney Robert McDuff said. The government said the privileges help protect patients by ensuring they have continuity of care if a woman needs to go to the hospital. They also note that while the clinic might have to wait to get hospital privileges, \"inconvenience is not 'irreparable harm'.\" The state attorney general's office declined to comment after the hearing. The law was passed by the GOP-controlled legislature and came into force in July. When Bryant signed it, he said: \"If it closes that clinic, then so be it.\" The state's attorney had argued that any anti-abortion statements by elected officials were \"weak evidence\" that the purpose of the law was to prevent abortions. After the hearing, Terri Herring of the Pro Life America Network told the Associated Press that the hospitals should deny admitting privileges for the abortion clinic's doctors. Herring, who has lobbied for the law, said: \"There's no vetting process for fly-by-night physicians who come in and perform abortions at the clinic.\" Opponents of the law say any patient experiencing complications could receive immediate care from emergency room physicians. The clinic's owner, Diane Derzis, said that since she bought the clinic in 2010, no women had to be taken from the clinic by ambulance. The Jackson Women's Health Organization also has a transfer agreement with a local doctor who has hospital admitting privileges. He does not perform abortions at the clinic but provides backup help by agreeing to meet clinic patients at a hospital in case of an emergency. If the clinic closed, the closest alternatives are about 200 miles away, in Louisiana, Tennessee and Alabama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
