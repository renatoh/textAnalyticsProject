Like the BBC iPlayer, the treasures of which I unpacked a few months ago, Channel 4\u2019s All 4 outlet tends to be taken a bit for granted: a catch-up service that outwardly seems more useful than exciting. It moved up a level in October, however, with the addition of the Film4 channel to its online bouquet. As a free-to-air TV channel, of course, Film4 has long been a friend to discerning cinema fans, though it\u2019s often difficult to keep track of its best programming: many of its most essential or unusual film selections tend to screen in the middle of the day or well past most sensible people\u2019s bedtimes. The streaming version \u2013 tucked away in All 4\u2019s slightly cluttered interface, though the simpler URL film4.com will take you there \u2013 has a small but thoughtfully chosen selection of films both widely known and undeservedly obscure. As with the iPlayer, they\u2019re available to stream for variable lengths of time: up to four weeks in some cases, though most of today\u2019s standout picks have a fortnight left on them. As you\u2019d expect, a fair portion of the films are from Film4\u2019s own production label. It\u2019s no surprise to see a triple bill of Danny Boyle films, for example, in case the runny cheese of this year\u2019s Yesterday has you hankering for a reminder of Trainspotting\u2019s youthful edge. Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Sexy Beast is another worthy in-house selection, as is British playwright debbie tucker green\u2019s fine film debut, the needling, subtly uncanny marital drama Second Coming. Away from Film4\u2019s own, Park Chan-wook\u2019s lavishly kinked-out Sarah Waters adaptation The Handmaiden is a welcome sight on any streaming menu, though not one you\u2019d be hard pressed to find elsewhere. The less expected surprises on the current menu include Jordana Spiro\u2019s Night Comes On, a standout from 2017\u2019s Sundance festival that never got a UK cinema release. Its story of an African American teenager, fresh out of juvenile detention, determined to exact revenge on her father for murdering her mother, has hard, honest social texture to balance out its genre allusions, and a galvanising debut performance by the tremendously named Dominique Fishback. Also streaming is Rafiki, Kenyan film-maker Wanuri Kahiu\u2019s tender lesbian coming-of-age drama, painted in vibrant pastels. A pioneering work of LGBT cinema in its home country, where it was banned by censors, it\u2019s gentle, feelgood viewing by any other standards. Khalik Allah\u2019s Black Mother is a stimulating, sharply sensual documentary ode to Jamaican identities past and present, home and abroad, assembled with intuitive, rhythmic visual poetry; little wonder that Allah worked as a cinematographer on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade project. Another adventurous left-field selection: American animator Dash Shaw\u2019s delightful My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, a short, cockeyed teen comedy that breaks off into loopy allegory, its ragged edges held together by peppy comic-book visuals. Finally, while we\u2019re on All 4, after the success of streaming last year\u2019s Channel 4 Indian film season, they\u2019re doing the same this year. The first four titles in the 2019 season will be available to stream from Wednesday next week: Veere Di Wedding, a rare Bollywood foray into the female buddy-film genre; Satyakam, a 1969 epic chronicling the final days of the British Raj; Nachom-ia Kumpasar, a showbiz romance set against the Goa jazz scene; and Manmarziyaan, a contemporary love triangle from the ever-interesting film-maker Anurag Kashyap (Gangs of Wasseypur). Others will be added in the coming weeks, including the restored, underseen Satyajit Ray film Kapurush \u2013 it\u2019s good to see All 4 focused on keeping its film library as diverse as it is free. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Diego (Altitude, 12) Asif Kapadia returns to the icon-centred documentary form that earned him awards for Amy and Senna. As a living-legend portrait, this study of the Argentinian footballer doesn\u2019t have quite the same emotional pull, but it\u2019s assembled with absorbing flair. Nuri Bilge Ceylan: The Complete Films (Drakes Avenue, 15) The most serious cinephile gift of the season: a Blu-ray box set comprising all eight of the Turkish slow-cinema master\u2019s feature films, bedecked with extras including assorted making-of documentaries and an early, rarely seen short. The Palm Beach Story (Sony, E) A joyous addition to the Criterion Collection: Preston Sturges\u2019s vintage screwball romcom still fizzes with energy, its sun-warmed, Floridian tangle of marital and economic troubles lifted by Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea\u2019s star chemistry and delicious ping-pong dialogue. Gwen (RLJ, 15) Vividly set in the wind-whipped hills of 19th-century Snowdonia, William McGregor\u2019s auspicious debut is rich in gothic atmospherics, though its story of an all-female farmstead battling dark forces isn\u2019t quite the supernatural folk horror it appears to be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
