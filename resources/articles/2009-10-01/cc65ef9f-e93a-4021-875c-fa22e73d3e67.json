In the 1960s, the handsome, charismatic Richard O'Barry trained the performing dolphins used in the popular, long-running American television series Flipper, which resulted in the creation of dolphinariums the world over. He then did a complete volte-face and for the past 35 years has been attempting to undo his work by using all means possible to keep dolphins from being captured and exploited.He is an articulate, middle-aged man, exuding an undemonstrative decency and this picture records how he gathered an intrepid team of film-makers, divers, electronics experts and special-ops people who infiltrated the Japanese fishing port of Taiji to record and expose its dirty secret. This is a first-rate heist movie in which the good guys are the gang and the bad guys the supposed honest citizens upholding law and order. Every year, the local fishermen, in league with various commercial interests, drive dolphins into a local cove where dolphin trainers from around the world select the best specimens, for which they pay up to $150,000. The rest are pushed around a peninsula to another cove, as closely guarded as Dr No's lair, to be slaughtered and sold as whale meat. It's an astonishing story, carefully told, and along the way we learn a great deal about greed, human nature, various kinds of private and governmental chicanery and the working of that dubious organisation, the Japanese-dominated International Whaling Commission."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
