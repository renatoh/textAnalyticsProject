He started to look at his own energy consumption and found it was challenging to get detailed, useable information from the local utility company other than a billing statement in his mailbox once a month. \"I realised there was an opportunity to have a massive impact on energy efficiency just by educating people and giving them insight, choice and control of their energy use in ways that weren't available at the time,\" Tuck says. This realisation became the basis for Tendril Connect, a software platform that the company has now sold to some 40 energy utility companies. According to Tuck, the Tendril Connect platform is now crunching nearly five terabytes of big data each month for these companies related to the energy use of their residential customers, local weather patterns, demographic and behavioral information. Analysing all this data, the platform enables energy utilities to provide their residential customers with personalised energy reports, conservation tips, and even automation of home appliances to reduce consumption. Energy savings vary depending on the customers' level of engagement. They can choose to receive reports, either by mail or email, showing their consumption patterns and offering energy-saving advice. The annual energy savings for customers who receive these reports is between one to three percent, according to Tendril's estimates. An online web portal and mobile app goes beyond paper reports to offer energy saving games, challenges and social media interaction with other like-minded customers. Savings from the online tools range from four to seven percent annually. Energy providers can offer their customers Tendril's home control devices like smart thermostats and smart outlet plugs. These smart devices automate the process of turning the temperature up/down or turning major appliances on/off based on rules set by the customer. Annual savings are in the eight to 10 percent range, estimates Tendril. Tendril's products are also helping energy providers facilitate load control and demand response programs. These allow the utility to directly control appliances and heating and cooling systems in the customer's home during times of peak demand. Energy savings from these programs range from 15 to 25 percent. Almost all of this work is with US-based energy companies, although Tendril now supports a large project in Australia and another in the Netherlands. The company is working to secure future business in Japan, Germany, China and India \u2013 all countries where energy efficiency has become a priority, notes Tuck. Homes consume about a third of the electricity generated each year in the US, and many utilities are facing mandates from regulators to reduce this amount. So it's no surprise that the market for home energy management products is growing and expected to reach $2bn by 2020, according to estimates from Pike Research. But it's also a crowded sector, with hundreds of companies now selling products and services either to energy utilities or directly to consumers. Tuck believes Tendril's emphasis on developing products to open industry standards will set it apart. Rather than trying to build everything in-house, this year the company opened its platform to outside developers and launched an application marketplace. More than 400 developers have already signed on, says Tuck, building everything from energy saving games to apps that control your home appliances.
