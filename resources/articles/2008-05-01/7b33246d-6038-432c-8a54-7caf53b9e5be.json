A year after Madeleine's disappearance, Gerry and Kate McCann called on anyone who has spoken to the Portuguese police about the case to contact them directly. Because of Portugal's secrecy laws, the McCanns said, they have not been informed of developments in the police operation, despite leaks to the Portuguese and Spanish media. The couple are still classified as arguidos - official suspects - in the case, and relations with the Portuguese investigation team are understood to be strained. Gerry McCann said: \"This is a last chance to capture a lot of information which has maybe gone into the investigation and we are not privy to. Clearly we need to know that everything has been done. What we are asking people to do is, if you have given information to police, Crimestoppers, the Portuguese police, we are asking you to give it to us as well. We are a year down the line and seemingly no closer to finding Madeleine.\" He added: \"We have got little bits of the jigsaw but huge gaps.\" In interviews to mark today's anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, the McCanns repeated their \"categoric\" belief that their daughter will be found alive. Asked why she felt Madeleine was still alive, Kate McCann, 40, said: \"It's a sense. Madeleine just feels very close. It's more of a kind of a sensation that she's there. You try to be objective and you think is it because I am her mum and I want to believe, but it has not changed.\" Yesterday the most senior police officer responsible for tracing missing children in England and Wales ruled out the introduction of an amber alert system for missing children embracing all of Europe. The McCanns have argued that such a scheme - modelled on the US amber alert project - could have helped to find Madeleine. The US scheme, which allows police forces to cooperate with other security agencies and the media as soon as a child is reported missing, is said to have helped in the recovery of around 400 children over the past five years. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Bryan of the Metropolitan police said British police already operate an effective \"child rescue alert\", but differences in national legislation prevented the introduction of such a system across Europe. Bryan, who leads for the Association of Chief Police Officers on missing people, said: \"There is a case for having national systems across Europe and moving towards an integrated European system, but I think the hurdles of getting to that point should not be underestimated.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
