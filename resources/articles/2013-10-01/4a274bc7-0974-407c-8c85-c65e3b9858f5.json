And at the Asia Pacific leaders\u2019 summit in Bali, that is exactly what he\u2019s set out to do, pitting his manhood directly against that of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir \u201cThe Centaur of St Petersburg\u201d Putin. It was at this summit that Abbott swaggered into the opening session seven minutes late, missing not only the opening remarks, but a small celebration of Putin\u2019s birthday during which Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono played guitar and sang Happy Birthday, a landmark moment in the history of incredibly strange events. But Abbott obviously thought it was worth missing this epochal weirdness to lay down the gauntlet to Putin: by turning up late, the little Aussie pedaller signalled that he is a dominant male, asserting his power by forcing others to conform to his timetable. \u201cI am far too manly,\u201d our Tony was saying to Vlad, \u201cto concern myself with sissy things like birthdays and punctuality.\u201d But has Abbott bitten off more than he can chew? Surely, so new to the job, he could\u2019ve eased himself into it by testing his masculinity against less formidably manly foes, like Stephen Harper or Hillary Clinton. Is it courage or foolhardiness to try to bring down an elephant on your first day on safari? Whatever the case, it\u2019s on. Witnesses reported a \u201cfrosty\u201d atmosphere in Bali, and Putin apparently snubbed Abbott as if he was Naomi Watts on Oscar night. The die has been cast and the man-off is on, so let\u2019s take a look at which man is more of a man than the other man. First of all, let\u2019s look at physique. Putin is renowned for his eagerness to flaunt his bare chest around the plains and forests of Europe, and there\u2019s definitely a Rambo quality to the man when he starts thrusting his nipples at the wildlife. But he may have met his match in Abbott, a man whose desire to achieve the highest political office is exceeded only by his desire to burn the outline of his barely-contained genitalia into the brains of every citizen of Australia. Putin likes to show off his chest, but Abbott is practically a Chippendale: he will flex and pose for anyone. But it\u2019s not all about appearances: what do these manly men do? Abbott, of course, likes to compete in triathlons, which does take a lot of muscle and involve a lot of sweating, so that\u2019s pretty mannish. He also volunteers as a fireman, a very manly calling, and in his youth he excelled at both boxing and rugby, so in his veins flows that perfect combination of violence and homo-eroticism that all men aspire to. However, check out old mate Vlad. He does judo, which lacks the pure bestial bloodlust of rugby; but when not using others\u2019 own strength against them, he likes to take to the outdoors. On a horse. With a gun. He hunts wild animals. Tigers. Bears. Moose. He prowls around the Siberian woods, shirt nowhere to be seen, as a variety of fearsome beasts find themselves frozen in the high-beams of that cold, dead-eyed KGB stare. It\u2019s lucky he\u2019s got affairs of state to distract him, or extinction rates would double overnight. And when he\u2019s not hunting, he\u2019s hang-gliding: last year he led a flock of endangered cranes on their migration route. How many world leaders do you know who can command the obedience of animals in the air, and pop a cap in their asses on the ground? Until Abbott gets on the back of a ute with a spotlight and a shotgun, I think we can be pretty certain who would win in a fight: Tony might have the reach and the technique, but Vladimir has a rifle and a ceaseless thirst for blood. So I think the man-off has to be awarded to Putin, but Abbott shouldn\u2019t lose hope. He\u2019s just a rookie, and he put up a very creditable fight. He\u2019s still manlier than John Key and David Cameron put together, and with a little more training, a few more dead animals, and a slightly more developed streak of savage homophobia, I am confident that our new prime minister can one day be the most macho of them all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
