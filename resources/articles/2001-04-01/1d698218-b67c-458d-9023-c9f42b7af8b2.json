However, with a nine-point deduct- ion (and \u00a320,000 fine), accruing from irregularities over gate receipts and the transfer of Luke Beckett, hanging over their heads, the champagne is still on ice. In truth, there are doubts whether the club could afford such luxuries. The financial crisis which has enveloped Saltergate has already seen the departure of six directors and a chairman this season; management and playing staff have not been paid for several weeks and bailiffs sought to claim the boardroom table - one of the few items of value left at the club. But, despite the off-field problems, the reality remains that a win at Cardiff today could see Nicky Law's side confirm promotion, regardless of the points deduction recommended by the Football Association and Football League panel last Thursday. Against Kidderminster on Saturday Chesterfield proved that they are peerless in this division on the pitch, with what Law described as their biggest 1-0 win of the season. The hosts twice hit the woodwork and had a goal disallowed before taking the lead through a soft goal in first-half injury-time. A Rob Edwards corner looked to have provided Tim Clarke, the Kidderminster goalkeeper, with the simplest of catches but he dropped the ball on to the head of Beckett, who accepted the gift and his 17th goal of the season. An equally one-sided second period saw the visitors lead a charmed life. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
