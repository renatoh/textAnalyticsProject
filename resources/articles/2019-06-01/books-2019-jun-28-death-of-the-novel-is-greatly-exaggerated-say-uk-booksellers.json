But the latest rumblings of its demise, which come courtesy of a drop in fiction sales in 2018, have been comprehensively dismissed by the books world, with new books from Margaret Atwood and Philip Pullman expected to drive a return to growth this year. The Publishers Association\u2019s yearbook suggested this week that sales of fiction dropped in physical formats last year, down 7% to \u00a3359m. The fall was not offset by a 4% rise in digital fiction sales, to \u00a3229m, with overall fiction sales down 3% in 2018 to \u00a3588m. By contrast, sales for non-fiction rose 1%, to \u00a3954m, with digital revenues up 10% and physical sales remaining level. The Publishers Association noted a \u201cstandout\u201d performance from non-fiction, which it said had grown by almost 30% in the last five years, as well as the \u201cphenomenal\u201d growth of audiobooks, up 43% between 2017 and 2018. Stephen Lotinga, PA\u2019s chief executive, said fiction sales had been in decline for a number of years \u2013 since 2014, total fiction sales have dropped by 4%. He added: \u201cOut of all the books we produce, fiction is most exposed to people\u2019s leisure time. Whether it\u2019s Netflix or playing computer games or going on social media, they are in competition.\u201d But he was adamant that Netflix was not killing the novel, noting that book adaptations were driving much of the strongest television programming, such as Game of Thrones, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and the forthcoming BBC/HBO adaptation of Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy, and these adaptations then push up book sales in turn. \u201cWe are one of the primary investors in original stories, and storytelling is key to all our creative industries, with so many conversions from books into theatre, film, television,\u201d Lotinga said. \u201cWe find that very encouraging. The adaptations happen and it comes back, so it\u2019s a wonderful virtuous circle.\u201d Lotinga also said readers had gravitated from fiction to non-fiction over the last five years. Citing the 24% rise in physical non-fiction sales since 2014, Tom Tivnan, at the trade magazine The Bookseller, agreed that \u201cnarrative long-form reading habits are switching, in part, from fiction to non-fiction\u201d. \u201cH Is for Hawk, I think, really kicked this off, but people are looking for those \u2018memoirs that matter\u2019,\u201d said Tivnan, \u201cpersonal stories that can touch a wider complex issue (like grief, dementia, mental health) or the \u2018smart non-fiction\u2019 that has an expert explaining wider, universal issues.\u201d A decade ago, he said, non-fiction was dominated by celebrities such as Sharon Osbourne and Peter Kay, but now bestseller lists were full of \u201cAdam Kay piloting his way through the NHS, the Secret Barrister wading through a broken justice system\u201d. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need fiction as much any more as there are so many non-fiction stories that look deep into the human heart and what makes us tick: Raynor Winn\u2019s The Salt Path, Matt Haig\u2019s Notes on a Nervous Planet, and on and on. \u201cThe hottest properties for acquiring editors right now \u2013 besides trying to find the next Sally Rooney \u2013 are non-fiction authors who can write well, provocatively and become brands,\u201d said Tivnan. \u201cThe next Dolly Alderton, the next Yuval Noah Harari, the next Secret Barrister, the next Adam Kay, the next Wendy Mitchell, the next Christie Watson. Non-fiction is where it\u2019s at.\u201d Kate Skipper, Waterstones\u2019 buying director, agreed that people liked a good story, \u201cwhether it\u2019s real or imagined\u201d, but attributed the drop in fiction sales to a lack of titles from big novelists last year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a stellar year for fiction by any means,\u201d she said. \u201cNot many of the big fiction-brand authors had titles out.\u201d This year, by contrast, Atwood publishes the sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in September, with new novels from John le Carr\u00e9 and Pullman also expected to drive stronger sales than last year. \u201cThis year publishing is really strong and it\u2019s strong across the categories, books that appeal to different readers, to drive customers into shops,\u201d said Skipper. \u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful about Christmas.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
