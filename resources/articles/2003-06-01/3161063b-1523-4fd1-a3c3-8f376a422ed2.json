Ian Gibson, chairman of the House of Commons science and technology committee, said it would be looking at how the Department for International Development uses science and technology in its programmes in the developing world. He said the committee would also be looking at the \"brain gain\" of scientists from the developing world to the UK and how this could affect patenting. The committee would be particularly interested, he added, in investigating whether scientists in the developing world were being supported by the UK in biotechnology. \"It's about looking at DFID's activity and how they transfer research knowledge in Britain to the developing world. We'd be interested in how people are trained in developing countries and here. There may be other things that arise such as how biotechnology and GM is used in the developing world and how we support them. The committee has been thinking about these kind of issues as it goes around the world,\" he told EducatoinGuardian.co.uk. Peter Cotgreave, director of the campaigning group Save British Science, welcomed the committee's investigation, saying: \"We know about the brain drain from here to the States, we also know that a lot of western countries are filling their brain deficits with people from the developing world. If you look at people in the US and UK universities, there's a large number of Chinese people. As those countries, and China is a good example, get better on their own it's going to be more difficult for us to plug our deficit that way.\" He added: \"Western countries tend to research western problems - there's been more research on the common cold than malaria. As those countries get more money and spending powers, and develop, they will want to research solutions to their problems because they will be able to afford to deal with this.\" The recent white paper on higher education placed a strong emphasis on developing a handful of gold standard institutions able to compete internationally in terms of research. Last year, the prime minister outlined his concern about the standing of British science abroad. In a speech last May, he told the Royal Society that, on a visit to India, scientists in Bangalore described Europe was \"going soft\" on science. The science committee is scheduled to begin its investigations in October. Calls for consultation will go out at the end of this month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
