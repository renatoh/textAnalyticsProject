The 111 mostly part-time coroners in England and Wales would be replaced with 65 full-time posts, with a new post of chief coroner, directly answerable to ministers. Relatives of the dead would get the right to ask the coroner for a second opinion on a death certificate, or challenge a decision by appeal to the chief coroner. Coroners could restrict press reporting in inquests where there is no overriding public interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
