Be sure to check out Kevin Mitchell\u2019s full report from Flushing Meadows. Djokovic addresses the crowd before he accepts the US Open trophy from four-time champion John McEnroe. He\u2019s asked to whom he attributes his turnaround since the start of the summer. \u201cTo the support of loved ones: my kids, my wife, my team of people that has been there with me through difficult times as well,\u201d Djokovic says. \u201cWhen I had the surgery of elbow earlier this year, I could truly understand waht Juan Martin was going through. Difficult times, but you learn from adversary and when you\u2019re down. I try to take the best out of myself in those moments.\u201d Djokovic then congratulates Del Potro for what he\u2019s done to come back, before lifting the trophy and accepting check for the princely sum of $3.8m. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to speak right now but I love you too, guys,\u201d Del Potro says at the trophy ceremony. \u201cSo happy to be playing in the final against this magnificent idol. He knows that\u2019s he\u2019s one player that I want to watch winning titles. Of course I\u2019m sad because I\u2019d lose, but I\u2019m happy for him and his team too.\u201d He adds: \u201cI never gave up during my wrist problems. I was trying to fix all my injuries to be here once again and I got it after nine years, which is amazing to me because the US Open is my favorite tournament on tour. I am very proud for that.\u201d A tearful Del Potro has retreated to his chair in dejection. Meanwhile, Djokovic has scaled the walls to apparently make it toward his player box, but hops back down to the court ahead of the trophy ceremony.

And to the surprise of no one it\u2019s a Del Potro crowd! Swells of applause and \u2018Ole\u2019 chants for the well-liked Argentinian. Ashleigh Barty and CoCo Vandeweghe have just completed a stunning 3-6, 7-6 (2) 7-6 upset of the top-ranked team of Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic in the women\u2019s doubles final. It\u2019s their first major title after a combined six runner-up finishes in women\u2019s and mixed doubles respectively. For more on yesterday\u2019s controversial women\u2019s singles final, here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s take. Although today\u2019s final will be fiercely contested, Djokovic and Del Potro have immense respect for each other. And the sympathy for Del Potro is spread wide across tennis. Partly because of his talent, partly because he has come back from horrendous injury problems and partly because he is a lovely guy. \u201cI personally like [Del Potro] very much, not just as a player but as a person. He is a dear friend, someone that I respect a lot,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cWe all felt for his struggles with injuries that kept him away from the tour for two, three years. \u201cBut he was always a top-five player in the eyes, I think, of everyone. Even when he dropped his ranking and started to work his way up, we all knew that he has a capacity and a quality to get to the point where he is at the moment. It was just a matter of time.\u201d Good afternoon from a rainy New York. There\u2019s a steady rain falling here, but not so heavy that the New York Mets can\u2019t play their game against the Philadelphia Phillies just over the road at Citi Field. Nevertheless, the roof will be up for the men\u2019s final today, as it was yesterday. Speaking of yesterday\u2019s final, you may have heard it got a little spicy. You may also be interested to read about the umpire, Carlos Ramos, who has a history of run-ins with players: Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on today\u2019s mouthwatering final: Humanitarian notions that five\u2011setters are reducing the best players to physical wrecks is somewhat diluted by the presence in Sunday\u2019s US Open final of Novak Djokovic and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, who have experienced more than their share of physical and spiritual hurt in long, garlanded careers. There is the counter argument of Rafael Nadal\u2019s retirement when his right knee collapsed after he had lost two sets against Del Potro on Friday. But the Spaniard \u2013 who played the two longest matches of the tournament going into his semi-final \u2013 is not advocating three-set slam matches, even in the early rounds, a proposition gathering some fringe support. Standing above the clamour is the Tower of Tandil himself, Del Potro, who beat Nadal and Roger Federer to win his only grand slam here nine years ago. Pain in his wrists prevented him from defending his title in 2010, then worsened to the point where he spent more time in the company of surgeons than his rivals on the Tour.
