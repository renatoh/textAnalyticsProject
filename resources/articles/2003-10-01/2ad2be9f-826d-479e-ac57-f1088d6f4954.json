Despite having separate brains, Mohammed and Ahmed Ibrahim share an important vein and would face a lifetime of medical problems if they remained conjoined. They are the first Siamese twins to be surgically separated since the deaths of the Iranian-born Bijani twins in July. Sheep finally go home More than 50,000 sheep stranded at sea for the past six weeks will begin the two-week voyage back to Australia from Kuwait tomorrow. The animals, exported to Saudi Arabia for slaughter, were refused permission to land in August because of an 'unacceptably high incidence' of disease. Nearly 5,000 have died. Taliban prison escape Forty political prisoners, including several high-ranking Taliban members, have tunnelled out of jail in the Afghan city of Kandahar. Among the escapeers, who fled through a 30 metre tunnel on Friday night, was the brother of Taliban Defence Minister Mawlavi Obaidullah. Athletes locked out Thirty-six athletes participating in the African Games were locked out of their hotels in the Nigerian capital of Abuja after organisers failed to pay the bill. Telephone operator Nitel also threatened to disconnect lines at the Games village and 7,000 employees at the Games, which end next Saturday, had not been paid for weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
