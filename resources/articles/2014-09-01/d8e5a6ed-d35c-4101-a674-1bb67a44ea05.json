New GCSEs in maths, English language and English literature, which will be taught in schools from September next year, will be graded 1 to 9, with 9 being the top grade. However, fewer pupils sitting the new exams may be awarded the highest grade than currently get an A*, exams regulator Ofqual revealed. Of those sitting the revamped exams from the summer of 2017 onwards, fewer than 3% of teenagers could be awarded the very top results, it emerged. The changes follow demands from ministers to toughen up a marking system they claim has been discredited by years of grade inflation, and calls for greater differentiation among higher achievers. Under the new grading system, which will replace the old A*-G marking, only the top 20% of those who get grade 7 and above will get a grade 9. So in maths, whereas 4.9% of last year's entries \u2013 about 37,248 in total \u2013 got an A*, only 2.9% \u2013 about 22,045 \u2013 would have got a grade 9. In English, 3.3% of GCSE candidates (about 24,127 in total) were awarded an A*, whereas under the new system, 2.8% of candidates (about 20,472) would have been awarded a grade 9, and in English literature, 5.5% of exams gained an A* last summer, while 4.6% would have scored a grade 9 under the overhauled system. Ofqual is yet to decide whether the same top 20% rule will apply to the second tranche of GCSE subjects, due to be introduced later with initial examinations in 2018. Under the new structure the same proportion of students will achieve a grade 4 and above as currently achieve a C and above; the same proportion of students will get a 7 and above as currently achieve an A or A*, and the bottom of grade 1 will correspond with the bottom of G. The new system will also allow for better international comparisons \u2013 grade 5 will be positioned in the top third of marks for a current grade C and the bottom third of marks for a B, bringing it broadly in line with the average Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) performance in higher performing countries such as Finland and Canada. Ofqal's chief regulator Glenys Stacey said the approach in the first year would be to draw heavily on statistical evidence to make sure there were clear anchor points from the old system to the new. \"This will make sure that the year group students are not disadvantaged or advantaged because of the introduction of the new qualifications, and will provide some certainty about what to expect at this time of significant change.\" Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Harder exams in themselves do not lead to higher standards. Excellent teaching and clear leadership are what enable students to achieve more.\" \"Employers need a clear message that if a student has achieved a particular grade, it means that they have a certain skill or knowledge level. There will be a large number of students who end up with both letter and numerical grades, so it is important to have a benchmark that shows how the two relate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
