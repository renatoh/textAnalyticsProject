Vowing to join a protest vote against the government following a Commons debate on the war, he said the number of dissenters would grow and grow. In the most passionate of a number of speeches criticising the operation and the Government's approach, he said there was a \"fantastic dislocation\" between the atmosphere in the Commons and that in the rest of the world. He said: \"You wouldn't think, listening to the secretary of state for defence, that more than half of the population of the country want the bombing to stop now so that humanitarian aid could be flooded in.\" Hitting out at the use of cluster bombs, he said anyone who thought the opinion of the Arab world was with the coalition was living in \"cloud cuckoo land\". He urged other MPs to vote against the government at the end of the debate, in a division on a technicality being forced by rebels in protest at not being given any chance to vote on the war. Tory Andrew Tyrie said the west faced a dilemma because \"while military activity in Afghanistan may succeed in eliminating al Qaida in an organised form it may at the same time generate sympathies in parts of the Muslim world which could make terrorism more likely. Worse, it could destabilise Pakistan and Saudi Arabia...\" Opening the fifth debate on the conflict since September 11, the defence secretary Geoff Hoon threw down a challenge to those critical of the bombing. \"How else should we bring those responsible for the hijacking of the planes and the deliberate murder of thousands of ordinary people to account? \" \"How else should we act to prevent bin Laden and the al Qaida network from killing possibly thousands more American or British or European civilians?\" he demanded. Donald Anderson accepted that there were problems as the campaign progressed but urged MPs to recall the 78 days of bombing in Kosovo. \"Our goals are clear and if we were to wobble now it would be tantamount to giving a form of victory to bin Laden and his associates.\" Mr Anderson said the law might be needed to be updated to deal with British citizens who had volunteered to fight for the Taliban against the coalition. He called for airline security to be tightened and for careful screening for potential terrorists among foreign students learning sensitive subjects at British universities. \"They don't come to the West to learn medieval English literature.\" \"We should be one step ahead of the terrorists throughout. The terrorists have used the one technique against the World Trade Centre. They are unlikely to use that same technique again. It may be other forms of asymmetric warfare, it may be crop spraying, it may be biological or chemical weapons,\" he added. Gerald Kaufman congratulated the prime minister on his trip to the Middle East which he said allowed him to face the \"brutal starkness\" of emotions in that region. In a hard-hitting speech, he urged Israel and the Palestinians to find a \"third way\" forward, rather than resorting to extremist standpoints.\" Condemning both \"brutal\" Ariel Sharon and \"former terrorist\" Yasser Arafat, Mr Kaufman said the conflict was being exploited by murderers who had no interest in the plight of the Palestinians. Mr Kaufman said: \"Whatever the outrage, whether it's the outrage of the attack on the World Trade Centre in September, whether it was Saddam Hussain's invasion of Kuwait all come back to the existence of Israel. \"Let's be clear about the hypocrisy of this. Bin Laden doesn't care one jot for the Palestinians, neither did Saddam Hussein, neither do the Syrians ... what these extremists, what these murders do, is to exploit the plight of the Palestinians as a cause around which they can rally. \"They would like to destroy the state of Israel if they could, but they know they can't, so they do their best to disrupt it and too many Israeli leaders play into their hands. They demand the world's sympathy but themselves behave like bullies.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
