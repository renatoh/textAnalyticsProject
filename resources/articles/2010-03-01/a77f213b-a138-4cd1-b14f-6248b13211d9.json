They would have struggled to have been more abject than they were in 2006 and 2008, matches again in which the trylines remained uncrossed, but at least now they are trying to play rather than just being trying. Scotland also had a go, running from their own 22 after 11 minutes, but if the will was there, the commensurate ability was not and the result was a match that started quite brightly faded with the setting sun into the dark of ball-killing at the breakdown, scrum collapsing and weak refereeing. England played for all bar the first four minutes of the second half without Jonny Wilkinson, who was helped from the field after thumping his head into the ground having attempted to tackle Max Evans. The fly-half looked as fuddled as England's attacking strategy this season, and if his replacement, Toby Flood, brought a measure of order and organisation to a back division who had been too amorphous, Wilkinson was sorely missed at the end as England found themselves in a familiar position as the clock ticked down, rolling on in search of a three-pointer. Flood, who had kicked two penalties out of three after coming on, giving England the lead on both occasions, had a 45-metre penalty with two minutes left after the replacement hooker, Scott Lawson, had negligently scragged Danny Care, and his drop goal attempt in the final seconds was charged down by Nick de Luca. Lawson was relieved as Flood's kick landed on the padding of the left upright and on an afternoon when players were only too willing to test the tolerance threshold, which turned out to be far too high, of the referee, Marius Jonker, especially at the breakdown, his was the most crass of a series of mindless offences. Given the way the game started, with both sides trying to move the ball in their own half, an early yellow card for killing the ball at the breakdown might have served as the accelerant the game so desperately needed. Instead, Jonker contented himself with warnings. Steve Borthwick, as the England captain, received three after his players had killed the ball in a ruck and was ordered to listen in as Dylan Hartley received a lecture for throwing a punch at Ross Ford when the two front rows squared up after a scrum collapse. Jonker was as responsible as the two sides for the game lacking so much in lustre. If the first half of the season saw a glut of kicking out of hand because teams were afraid to take the ball into contact, with attacking teams targeted by officials at the breakdown, the target has now turned to defenders and teams can no longer use the referee as an excuse for a lack of enterprise. Equally, referees need to be harsher on players who wilfully kill the ball, although quite why the two sets of forwards saw the need to be so cynical with neither back division looking threatening took some explaining. Both sides deserved yellow cards, but England were the more obviously cynical because they had more defending to do. They adroitly shared the misdemeanours around, Lewis Moody escaping a card because his flop over the top had come only seconds after he had replaced James Haskell, but the cumulative effect was to slow the game down to a crawl. If neither coach was satisfied with a draw, Scotland's Andy Robinson looked more like breaking out in a grin than his opposite number, Martin Johnson, even though the draw meant his side will collect the wooden spoon unless they defeat Ireland in Dublin on Saturday. Yet for all their possession, Scotland threatened to score a try only when Dan Parks chipped to the line or cross-kicked. They struggled to create space with the ball in hand, but they are a more rounded team under Robinson. England did work more openings and had they opted for a more mobile back five would probably, well possibly, have taken at least one of their opportunities. Scotland regularly took play through eight, nine or 10 phases, while England struggled to go beyond four and again lost the turnover count, this time 5-0. Until they place more emphasis on pace in the back row, they will struggle to finish what they start. Johnson for once made early tactical substitutions. Wilkinson had only just gone off when Ben Foden came on for Delon Armitage, who had again looked indecisive. Within five minutes, England had a scrum-half on the wing when Ben Youngs replaced Ugo Monye, who suffered a clash of heads with Kelly Brown and was taken to hospital for an X-ray after leaving the field on a stretcher. England's few minutes of daring faded into familiar attrition. They had trailed 9-6 at the interval: Parks twice kicked penalties that were each equalised by Wilkinson before dropping a goal. Wilkinson's last act was to kick a penalty, but after Flood had twice given England the lead, Parks levelled the scores with two penalties and hit a post with two others. The woodwork saved England, but if only their attacking strategy would work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
