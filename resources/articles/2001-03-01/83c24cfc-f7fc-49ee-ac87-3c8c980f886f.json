The FA wrote to Uefa's chief executive Gerhard Aigner last week asking him to investigate whether Piat, the vice-president of the international players' union Fifpro, provided tickets which ended up on the black market. The FA carried out investigations into the matter after Euro 96 and raised questions about whether the now defunct firm David Dryer Sports Travel was selling unauthorised tickets. The FA alleges that Piat was involved with two companies it believes supplied David Dryer with most of its Euro 96 tickets. It is understood that the FA has urged Uefa to look into the matter given the prominent position held by the Frenchman, who is also the head of France's professional footballers' union. Piat, who works alongside Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, at Fifpro, has been a hardline figure in the negotiations with the European Commission. If true, the allegations could be a serious embarrassment for Fifpro. One of Piat's colleagues, the Fifpro general secretary Theo van Seggelen, has described the allegations as \"unbelievable\". Van Seggelen added: \"I have never heard about this, we have never spoken about it and I cannot believe it. He is absolutely not involved in this.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
