Nothing yet, but that could be about to change at Winged Foot. The scale of Wolff\u2019s potential achievement is borne out by history. Ouimet was the last player to win the US Open on his debut; 107 years ago. Freakishly, 1913 also marked the last time this major was held in September. It even concluded on the month\u2019s 20th day. The 21-year-old Wolff, doubtless inspired by Collin Morikawa\u2019s success at last month\u2019s US PGA Championship, will take a two-stroke lead at five under par into day four after a third round display that completely belied his inexperience. Wolff\u2019s grip on this major was tightened on the final green, where he converted for a birdie. The leader\u2019s wonderful second shot, from 207 yards, had finished within 10ft of the cup. Wolff signed for a 65. Not only is this his maiden US Open appearance, it is only his second in a major. Winged Foot is renowned as one of golf\u2019s most brutal tests; Wolff has made it appear so blissfully straightforward. So far, that is. \u201cRight now I feel very confident with every single part of my game,\u201d said Wolff. \u201cI\u2019m not going to think about it too much and just go out there and do the same things I\u2019ve done the last three days. Right now I\u2019m just looking to go have a good time. And it\u2019s just golf. \u201cEven though it is the US Open, there\u2019s a lot of things in life that are a little different right now and in the world you can see how many things are affecting us.\u201d Wolff\u2019s maturity extends beyond the ropes. His front nine of 30 was outstanding. By the closing stages of his round, he held a four-stroke advantage over the field. That was reduced by Wolff failing to save par at the 16th but he stood strong as more illustrious, seasoned names wilted. Patrick Reed, who held the halfway lead, was ragged during a 77. Bryson DeChambeau is prone to talking at great length to himself mid-round but he appeared more irritated than is typical during a 70. Still, it is DeChambeau who sits closest to the unflappable Wolff. Recent history favours the older man, given the 27-year-old overturned a three-shot Wolff lead when winning in Detroit in early July. Louis Oosthuizen, who has major winning experience, quietly emerged from the pack with a 68, which edged him to one under par. \u201cI need to play pretty similarly to what I did today,\u201d said Oosthuizen when asked about his prospects of winning. \u201cYou need to hit fairways. \u201cI think everyone out there now, especially on this golf course, knows you need to be patient. A lot can happen even in the last two, three holes, so you have to try and get yourself in a position with three, four, five holes to go and see what you can do.\u201d Hideki Matsuyama was two under par before disaster struck at the penultimate hole. Matsuyama shanked a shot from green-side rough into a bunker. This all contributed to a double-bogey six. Matsuyama will begin the fourth round five from Wolff\u2019s lead. Xander Schauffele holed out from 30ft at the last to tie Matsuyama. Schauffele watched Wolff \u201cdestroy\u201d Harding Park in the final round of the US PGA. \u201cHe hits it really far,\u201d said Schauffele of Wolff. \u201cHe hits it really high. He\u2019s not afraid.\u201d Harris English later joined the level-par party. Rory McIlroy is not out of this tournament by any stretch. The Northern Irishman rebounded brilliantly from a second round of 76 by posting a 68. At one over, McIlroy\u2019s dreams of adding a fifth major title to his CV are very much alive. \u201cIf I go out there tomorrow and shoot another 68, I won\u2019t be too far away,\u201d said McIlroy. He did, however, admit the absence of galleries is a potential benefit to Wolff as he seeks to make history. \u201cIt\u2019s one variable that you just don\u2019t have to deal with,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s that loss of an advantage to you, who\u2019s accustomed to being in that environment.\u201d Paul Casey admitted he had thoughts solely on breaking 80 when playing his first seven holes in five over. The Englishman produced a stunning back nine of 30, meaning a 69 for a five-over aggregate. Dustin Johnson and Lee Westwood have the same 54-hole total. Jon Rahm\u2019s 76 leaves him seven over. At plus four, Justin Thomas needs a drastic fourth-round improvement plus collapses elsewhere; he shot 76 on Saturday. That score is, it must be said, about the best one can muster when playing Winged Foot almost exclusively from the rough. Mystery surrounds the actions of Danny Lee, who took nine at the 18th and duly withdrew from the event, citing a wrist injury. Maybe it was incurred when adding up his score. Sadly, no footage appears available of Lee\u2019s final-hole antics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
