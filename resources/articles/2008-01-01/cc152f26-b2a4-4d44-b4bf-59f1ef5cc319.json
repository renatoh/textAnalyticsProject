Amid growing pessimism about the risk of recession from the US spreading to the rest of the world, the meeting will look at the scope for lower interest rates to be accompanied by tax cuts. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said in Davos at the weekend that the fund would this week revise down its forecasts for world growth this year and gave the all clear for those countries with strong fiscal positions to reduce taxes or increase spending. \"Economies with a low fiscal risk have to use fiscal policy. They can't rely on monetary policy alone,\" the IMF managing director said. \"We are facing global imbalances and the sub-prime crisis is only part of it. We are facing also currency imbalances, surpluses rising in some countries, and rising commodity prices. All those imbalances have to be addressed.\" Strauss-Kahn's comments were echoed by European monetary affairs commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, who said there was room for European governments who had kept a tight rein on budgets to ease back as growth slowed. \"For the European economies who have pursued an ambitious consolidation of fiscal policies during the past three years - now they have the possibilities of letting their automatic stabilisers play their role,\" Almunia said. The call for more active fiscal policy came as an array of bankers and finance chiefs gave a gloomy assessment of the year ahead, despite last week's emergency cuts in interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of a $150bn (\u00a376bn) package of US tax cuts. \"It's going to take some time for these things to work their way through the system,\" Citibank chairman William Rhodes said. \"In a nine-inning ballgame, I think we're in the fifth inning.\" John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, gave a gloomy assessment of the US economy, predicting that the slump in the housing market would intensify this year. \"It will be a while before you see a return of normalcy in banking and markets,\" Thain said. \"I think there will continue to be downward pressure on home prices, that will continue to put downward pressure on all mortgage-related securities. The Fed cut and the fiscal stimulus package are not going to help declining house prices in the US.\" Japan's prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, said the world economy faced growing downside risks. \"There is no need for excessive pessimism,\" he said. \"However, we should respond quickly and should implement necessary measures.\" World Bank president Robert Zoellick said uncertainty pervaded the financial markets. \"Some firms are going to have some big losses,\" he said. \"I don't think this has fully run its course.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
