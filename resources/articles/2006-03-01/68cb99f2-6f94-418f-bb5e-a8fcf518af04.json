A statement from the attorney general's office said Lord Goldsmith - who was last night said to be \"incredibly cross and very disappointed\" - had heard Sir Ian's explanation and now regarded the matter as closed. A later statement from Scotland Yard said Sir Ian had used a tape recorder because: \"He thought that they would be discussing a complex issue, and as he was without a note-taker it would be helpful to have a record\". Pressure has been mounting on Sir Ian since it emerged yesterday that he had secretly recorded at least six telephone conversations with a digital recorder at his office at New Scotland Yard. Most controversially, he recorded a private conversation last September with the attorney general - the government's most senior legal adviser - in which they discussed counter-terrorism and wire tapping. Tony Blair's official spokesman today said the prime minister had \"full confidence\" in the Metropolitan police commissioner and that the matter was \"now closed\". The London mayor, Ken Livingstone, also gave his \"full backing\" to Sir Ian, who he said was doing a first-rate job. However, before the Sir Ian's apology was made public, some ministers had been less supportive. Harriet Harman, the constitutional affairs minister, called for an inquiry into Sir Ian's \"very baffling\" decision to tape his calls. \"It is certainly something that needs full investigation - not only what he has done but why he has done it,\" she told LBC News. Back at work Len Duvall, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), which can demand that the commissioner resign or retire, spent almost two hours this afternoon talking about the issue with senior Scotland Yard officers. After the talks, the Met's deputy commissioner, Paul Stephenson, said Sir Ian \"regretted\" the incident and added that he \"fully expected\" him to be back at work tomorrow. Sir Ian is thought to have returned to the UK today after a skiing holdiay. Asked if the commissioner had the confidence of his management board, Mr Stephenson said: \"I have every reason to think that every member of the management board has every confidence in Sir Ian Blair.\" He said he had not discussed the question of Sir Ian's resignation, and neither had anyone else, as far as he knew. But earlier today, one of the MPA's members, Richard Barnes, suggested that Sir Ian \"should be considering his position\". Sir Ian was supported, however, by Cindy Butts, the deputy chair of the MPA, who said he had not committed a \"sackable offence\". She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that he had the confidence of most of the Metropolitan police. Sir Ian also recorded conversations with three members of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigating the Stockwell shooting of the Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes. One taped conversation was with the IPCC chairman, Nick Hardwick, who today also accepted an apology from Sir Ian. An IPCC spokesman said the calls had been recorded \"without our prior consent\". He added: \"We are surprised about the recording of calls and now have the recordings. We are dealing with this issue.\" The controversy over the taped phone calls is the latest in a series of rows to embroil Sir Ian, who is already under investigation for his conduct in the wake of the shooting of Mr de Menezes. He was also criticised recently for saying he failed to understand why the Soham murders had dominated the news agenda in the way that they did. 'Serious explaining' There was debate about whether or not making the recordings was legal. The practice does not appear to breach the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which permits individuals to tape conversations provided the recordings are for their own use. Under this legislation, recording or monitoring are only prohibited when some of the contents of the communication are made available to a third party. If a person intends to make the conversation available to a third party, they must obtain the consent of the person being recorded. However, solicitor Mark Stephens, of Finers Stephens Innocent, said he believed the recording breached the Data Protection Act. He said: \"The first principle of data protection is that data must be processed 'fairly and lawfully' - by secretly recording the call Sir Ian was acting unfairly.\" The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: \"Controversy appears to attach itself to Sir Ian on an almost daily basis. These reports raise serious questions about his judgment and his leadership style.\" Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the human rights group Liberty, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that trust was \"a very, very important\" part of democratic arrangements in Britain, and Sir Ian had \"some serious explaining to do\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
