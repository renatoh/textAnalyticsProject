Twice well-fancied for big-field handicaps this season only to find things going against him, he was stepped up to Listed company and a mile and a quarter for the Festival Stakes. But the four-year-old landed odds of 100-30 in impressive fashion, albeit only by a neck, as Richard Hills travelled smoothly throughout the final three furlongs and left his effort until as late as possible. Trainer Marcus Tregoning was evidently delighted to land the contest with a horse he has long held in some regard, but deflected praise to the colt's owner Hamdan Al Maktoum. \"Sheikh Hamdan was adamant that he would get a mile and a quarter and he might even get a bit further than this, and I am pleased that he was proved right,\" Tregoning said. \"I don't think I have ever seen a horse travel as well as he did there, particularly as they were turning in. \"He is going the right way and we won't rush into making many decisions. I don't want to say that he is definitely not going to go to Royal Ascot, but I wouldn't want to overface him.\" Kerrin McEvoy successfully stepped in for the injured Frankie Dettori as Gonfilia scored a comfortable victory in the Excel Schroders London Boat Show EBF Conqueror Stakes. Trainer Saeed bin Suroor said: \"She is a very nice filly who showed me every morning in Dubai that she was good enough to win a Group race. doesn't mind any kind of ground and she has a good turn of foot.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
