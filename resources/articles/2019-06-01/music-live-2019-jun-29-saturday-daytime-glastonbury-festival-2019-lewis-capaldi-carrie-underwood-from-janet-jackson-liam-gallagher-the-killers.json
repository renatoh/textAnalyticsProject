There\u2019s a bacon sandwich with my name written on it. In bacon. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7pm, for the final night of Glastonbury 2019, with the Cure and so much more. Tomorrow night I will be drinking beer. It\u2019s going to get messy. Even messier. So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye-ee! Night all. It\u2019s still sweltering here. I envy you the chill. Five stars for Brandon Flowers and his Vegas showmen \u2013 plus guest spots from the Pet Shop Boys and Johnny Marr. In one of the most face-palm clashes of Glasto so far, Hot Chip are up against Chemical Brothers as Saturday night\u2019s dance headliner, but no matter: they\u2019re already winning summer with flying colours. Their latest album, A Bath Full of Ecstasy, is a kaleidoscopic pastel dive into house music and the halcyon days of rave, and earned them praise as \u201cBritain\u2019s best pop band of the last 10 years\u201d by this paper, made even more bittersweet, tragically, with the sudden death of its co-producer, Philippe Zdar, two days prior. One word that may have not yet been associated with Hot Chip is epic, but their latest stage show, bathed in pastel light, feels like step up. It\u2019s perhaps easy to forget how many massive tracks they have, even if they don\u2019t have the top 10 singles to show for it \u2013 One Life Stand and Night + Day are by now anthemic, as much as Over and Over and Ready for the Floor, their breakthrough hits, which sound refreshed here on the Park stage. Their new music, however, adds a new, more galvanising dimension to their sound. They bring out their Domino label-mate Georgia for the effervescently catchy Hungry Child while Spell - originally written for Katy Perry - is a spacious, sultry banger. Melody of Love is perhaps their songwriting at its best, about finding solace in joy. There are echoes of the band\u2019s old quirks when they\u2019re joined by Morris dancers for the shiny techno chomper Flutes and by their old school friend Four Tet to play guitar on their slaying version of Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage \u2013 but this is a Hot Chip reborn, slicker, far slicker than your average. undefined Two and a half decades in the game, Wu-Tang have undergone changes that would have probably seen off other groups. Deaths, falling outs and other assorted departures have winnowed down its original lineup, and their West Holts set is hampered further by the absences of Method Man and Inspectah Decks. Still sometimes compactness can be a virtue. Certainly this a more spirited effort than their last appearance here in 2011, where Method Man\u2019s decision to turn up in his dressing gown spoke to the drowsy, half-interested nature of the performance. Here, despite the absences, RZA, Ghostface etc al are in a more crowd-pleasing mode, leading call-and-responses with the audience. Deference is paid both to the late, great Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard, with his son (stage name: you guessed it, Young Dirty Bastard) tearing through Shimmy Shimmy Ya in his stead, and, inexplicably, Kurt Cobain, with a cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit. The real highlights though come when they dip into their debut and \u2013 still \u2013 greatest album, Enter the Wu (36 Chambers), which somehow celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. Shame on a Nigga and Protect Ya Neck sounds as great as they did a quarter-century ago. So, a triumph for Stormzy on Friday, and the Killers managed to win me over tonight. What are the Cure going to pull out tomorrow? Part of me hopes Robert Smith \u2013 a QPR supporter, it is always worth remembering \u2013 goes full misery guts and does something like play Pornography in full, twice in a row. But the odds have to be on a setlist packed full of 80s hits, don\u2019t they? Hot Chip slip in some Jonathan Richman! It only makes me love them more that they put a snippet of I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar into Night and Day. BBC Two is now showing Hot Chip. I\u2019ll be off to bed soon \u2013 well, strictly, I\u2019ll be off to have my tea, very late. But I know what you\u2019re wondering: \u201cFor every major act this evening \u2013 except the Killers \u2013 this man has produced, as if by magic, an interview with that act. Can he do the same with Hot Chip?\u201d Damn right I can, courtesy of Jude Rogers. Jason Williamson and Andrew Fearne, AKA Sleaford Mods, seem to embody the radical politics of Glastonbury. Making their name with 2013\u2019s Austerity Dogs for Williamson\u2019s stream of consciousness rant-raps set to Fearne\u2019s sparse, lo-fi beats, they have since developed their own knack for criticising the minutiae of daily life in Britain with cutting precision and skewed humour. The fact that they are playing on Shangri-La\u2019s Truth stage seems particularly fitting then \u2013 caustic honesty being Williamson\u2019s lyrical speciality. The duo take to the stage with typical swagger and nonchalance, Fearne stood behind a lone laptop sipping a beer and Williamson hunched over the adjacent mic, spewing out lines like: \u201cGraham Coxon looks like a leftwing Boris Johnson.\u201d The crowd is sparse but hanging off of Williamson\u2019s every word, jumping around to rave-led tracks from this year\u2019s Eton Alive album like Flipside and Kebab Spiders. This shouty soothsaying definitely won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, its minimalism too unvarnished to digest. Yet, Williamson is mesmerising, hip-swaying like Mick Jagger, high-kicking like a can can dancer and spitting venom like Keith Flint \u2013 his is a voice that certainly deserves to be heard. And Johnny Marr stays on stage with the Killers for the song everyone has been waiting for. And yes, I do like this one. Actual goosebumps. I wasn\u2019t mad about most of this set, but the Killers are finishing with half an hour of intensely focused crowd-pleasing. This is brilliant on the telly, but it must be overwhelming in the crowd. Brilliant choice of guests \u2013 aside from Jimmy Carr, which was just a bit odd \u2013 and perfect songs for them to play. Great, too, to keep them on for a Killers song afterwards. Crikey. The Killers are pulling everything out for the closing stages of their set. That distinctive jingle, and we\u2019re into one of the all-time great British singles. And we don\u2019t even have to listen to Morrissey singing it. Brandon Flowers looks absolutely thrilled. \u201cAre we human, or are we dancer?\u201d Another song I have issues with, because my teacher when I was nine was called Fred Dancer. And this always puts me in mind of him. Blimey, the Killers\u2019 set is turning into therapy. Please let them turn this into the Always in My House version. Please. Do you remember when the Killers went all rock on Sam\u2019s Town? Neil Tennant was asked in an interview what modern groups he liked, and said he had had high hopes for the Killers, but then they grew beards. He\u2019s obviously forgiven them. Imagine how great it would have been, though, if Pet Shop Boys had joined Hot Chip to do Always on My Mind. That would have been mind-blowing. I had swapped to the mighty Hot Chip on the iPlayer. But I had the shock of my life. They appeared to be doing a completely straight version of Crazy Town\u2019s Butterfly. Then I realised I had the sound on the iPlayer off, but YouTube had scrolled through annoying American hits after playing Mr Brightside, and Hot Chip weren\u2019t playing Butterfly. Would have been a daring move. Oh, back to the Killers! Jimmy Carr has literally swept the stage and Pet Shop Boys have come on to do You Were Always on My Mind with the Killers! Really, mate? I\u2019ve got arms but I\u2019m not an army. I\u2019ve got a cat, but I\u2019m not a catalyst. I\u2019ve got a kit, but I\u2019m not a kitchen. I\u2019ve got a car, but I\u2019m not a carpet. I\u2019ve got a bed, but I\u2019m not a Bedouin. I have an absolutely visceral hatred of this song, partly because it was in heavy rotation on MTV (in the days when it still played music) when my son, the new star of British rap, was tiny. He would wake very early, and I\u2019d take him downstairs and the sound of MTV would put him back to sleep. But if I turned it off he would wake. So I heard this 429,000 times. And also because I hate the glibness of that line: sounds meaningful, but is completely empty. Here\u2019s the crowd at the Chemical Brothers. What with their continued success (and that of Underworld), combined with all the posters I see around London for back to the 90s nights, I wonder why no one has yet anointed a Dad Rave scene, to succeed Dad Rock. Mind you, both the Chems and Underworld are pretty ace, unlike most of the Dad Rock bands. Mr Brightside is currently trending on Twitter, with people demanding the Killers play it now. NOW! NOW! Look, if you really can\u2019t wait another hour, have it here. If Brandon Flowers got a decent English accent and learned to act, he\u2019d be a shoo-in to be the next James Bond, because good God, he can wear a suit. From a Daily Mail commenter. Food for thought, eh? Back with the Killers, who\u2019ve just been playing Glamorous Indie Rock &amp; Roll, a song that sounded mildly snarky when it was released 15 years ago, but now sounds like a tragedy, with indie rock\u2019n\u2019roll having been so completely denuded of any hint of glamour in the intervening years. Another Glastonbury story from inside the music industry \u2026 \u201cThe last time I went to Glastonbury (2007) it was another Chems year, and, in what can only be described as \u2018marketing\u2019, I arranged for some giant inflatable hands (as featured on the album artwork) to be erected by the motorway on the approach to the site. A man was employed to sit in a car in the field at night to guard them. He fell asleep on the first night, and someone came along and stole ONE of them. The hands must have been at least 20 feet tall and were firmly secured to prevent them blowing away, so a pretty impressive feat. Never found out who it was or what happened to said inflatable hand, I\u2019d love to know.\u201d Lewis Capaldi and Liam Gallagher. Top level trolling of Noel. I\u2019ve switched over from the Killers because they were doing their not very good version of disco, to the Chemical Brothers who, I think, are now headlining a major Glastonbury stage for the sixth time, which is more even than Mad Dick from the 1970 bill managed. They\u2019re starting in relatively restained fashion, with Go, from 2015\u2019s Born in the Echoes. But then the electronic percussion machine guns the crowd, everything goes wobbly and we prepare to lift off \u2026 And here\u2019s Alexis Petridis interviewing the Chems. By Laura Snapes, who loves her some geezer rock. We interrupt the Killers to bring you this photo of Slowthai in his socks. I await the fashion desk\u2019s verdict. My 15-year-old son is agnostic about Slowthai, but then he\u2019s competition. My son is working on his own career in the UK rap scene, both with his drill crew \u2013 look, don\u2019t @ me about that; I\u2019m only his father \u2013 the Dartmouth Spartanz, but also as a solo artist. He has one track on Soundcloud, but I\u2019m not going to post it here. He\u2019d be furious. As he explained, the rapping\u2019s too quiet, which was because he did it on a school night when he was meant to be asleep, so he had to mutter his rap into his phone to make sure his mum and I didn\u2019t hear him. Serves me right. I express my doubts about the Killers, do a quick search, and then find them doing something absolutely lovely. Wales Online reported the other day that, knowing Mike Peters of the Alarm was at their Cardiff gig, they played a version of Rain in the Summertime in his honour. That\u2019s a nice story. You\u2019d find it hard to argue that the Somebody Told Me hitmakers are anything less than ruthlessly efficient. And when you\u2019re playing to the biggest crowd of the day, who are there strictly to party, there\u2019s nothing wrong with ruthlessly efficient. But it feels a bit like being in music\u2019s equivalent of a mid-market chain restaurant. Yes, you know it\u2019s going to be palatable, and in the right company you\u2019ll have a pleasant time. But I can\u2019t get more out of it. On the other hand, Brandon Flowers is headlining Glastonbury, whereas I\u2019m a month away from turning 50 and I\u2019m sitting on my sofa liveblogging it. Shows how much I know. Blimey, the Somebody Told Me hitmakers are going for it early, opening with Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, then Somebody Told Me. At this rate they\u2019ll have run through their hits by 10 past 10, so they can get back to the hotel to watch the cricket highlights (Brandon Flowers has been avoiding the score all day). There go my hopes of a set entirely composed of songs from the eight \u2013 eight! \u2013 albums the members have made outside the Killers. Curry goat, rice and peas and fried plantain from the Jerk Chicken stall near the Other Stage \u2014 not the cheapest food I\u2019ve tried (and nor should it be, with meat involved), but one of my favourite so far. Slow cooked until it falls from the bone with the merest flick of a tongue, and aromatic as hell, it\u2019s very good ballast for the headline acts this evening; especially with a side of properly caramelised plantains. Might come back for a pattie later. Yes, the most successful Mormon pop combo since the Osmonds are about to bring the magic. But, I wonder, which of the Somebody Told Me hitmakers\u2019 songs is the one that resonates most with the crowd? Why, it just so happens I have an article here that addresses that very question. And here we have the pictorial evidence: Janet Jackson on a chair with Michael Cragg. Janet Jackson on a chair. May see if I can find my photo of Angus Young standing on a chair to have his photo taken with me. Here\u2019s Dorian Lynskey\u2019s review of the first half of this year\u2019s Glastonbury, for the Observer. Looking forward to reading this, by one of my favourite writers. OK, while I wait for the Killers, I\u2019ve got Bugzy Malone on the iPlayer, who has been addressing anxiety and depression. And is now bringing Wonderwall into his set, like Stormzy last night shouting back to Jay Z. A great year for British black music at Glastonbury, with big slots on big stages. Now, The Killers. I completely get why they\u2019re headlining, because they\u2019ve got some big songs that everyone knows, but I do wonder if Glastonbury limits its headline pool by refusing to countenance any hard rock ever. I saw Kiss in Amsterdam on Tuesday, and I\u2019m convinced \u2013 whether you like them or not \u2013 they have enough songs people know to carry off a headline slot, and they certainly have the show to do so. Though there might be issues when they demand the right to sell off the the first 20 yards in front of the stage to their own fans. Ditto Def Leppard. They could easily do this. And here\u2019s some further proof that, yes, there is moshing at Glastonbury. Here are some Mancunians for you! On Twitter, Jeremy Mortimer draws my attention to \u201cproper moshing\u201d, as tweeted by someone else \u2026 Here\u2019s proof Liam got his organ from the grocer. And here\u2019s Sigrid. Given her wardrobe, she was probably the happiest person in Somerset with the weather. What happens when you cross Elvis with Nirvana? Well, Elvana \u2013 a sort of cabaret-cum-moshy karaoke mish-mash of both, with sequinned twin backing dancers/cheerleaders and musicians in suits and bowties. The singer is in full hip-wiggle mode, bedecked in a white jumpsuit emblazoned with an eagle, completed with a cape, medallion and Kurt Cobain\u2019s distinctive red oval sunglasses. Except these are the distinctively crunchy guitars of the grunge kings that we\u2019re hearing, mixed up with the King himself\u2019s 50s classics. \u201cWe are Elvana from Disgraceland,\u201d announces the frontman, whose name is unclear \u2013 Elbain? \u2013 before they run through Nirvana\u2019s In Bloom and School and then flip into a distorted rendition of Presley\u2019s I Feel So Lonely. Later comes A Little Less Conversation mashed into Smells Like Teen Spirit, in which the frontman surfs into an adoring crowd. It\u2019s idiotic, bafflingly brilliant and perfectly Glastonbury-shaped \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re playing three times over the weekend. Elvana manage to create something original and hilarious from time-worn songs that it would otherwise seem contrived to resurrect. Here\u2019s hoping for Sinatras of the Stone Age next. In the comments, Lemon5 has a question. My bet, today at least, would be that after a day of blistering heat, no one has the energy to mosh. And here\u2019s an answer to my question about what it\u2019s like in the middle of the Pyramid Stage crowd. At Longleat, The Driver\u2019s girlfriend professed her desire to drive through the monkey enclosure. And so they did. The park was not busy, and they were the only object of interest to the monkeys, who quickly surrounded the car. The Driver pulled to a standstill, and the monkeys leapt on the vehicle. They started pulling at the fittings: first the trim from the side of the car, then the windscreen wipers. Finally, the weekend\u2019s excesses caught up with The Driver, and he snapped. Ignoring all the park\u2019s advice, he opened the door, got out, and chased the monkeys through the enclosure. He caught up with the one who had wrenched off the windscreen wipers, and began wrestling the wiper back. He had reached the low point in his life. Still addled from the weekend, he was furiously fighting a monkey in a safari park. The wiper won back, he returned in triumph to the car, where one last monkey \u2013 a male \u2013 was astride the bonnet, performing an unspeakable act upon himself. And when he had finished, the lack of wipers meant there was no way to clean the windscreen. The next day The Driver returned the car to the hire company. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of damage,\u201d he said, handing over a single windscreen wiper. The hire company, perhaps unsurprisingly, disagreed. A few days later, The Driver\u2019s boss received a bill for \u00a35,000. There is a coda, though. A few days later, The Driver left the office for lunch, and his boss sat down at his desk, and began typing an email from The Driver\u2019s account, to Longleat, asking them to consider the distress of his girlfriend on having to see a monkey pleasure himself from just a few feet away. And a little while later, a reply arrived. \u201cDear The Driver,\u201d it said, \u201cWe were disappointed to hear of your experience at Longleat. However, our monkeys are wild animals, and they behave as such. We warn all visitors of this fact. However, we would be delighted to welcome you both back to the park, and we will arrange an identity parade of our monkeys, so you can pick out the miscreant.\u201d The Driver never went back to Longleat. The Wolf turned around. Behind them, on the back seat, The Disco King had fallen asleep. With a lighted cigarette in his fingers. Well, it had been in his fingers at one point. Now it had fallen to the seat, and set it on fire. Back to the hard shoulder, where The Driver and The Wolf woke The Disco King, and between the hapless three of them, they used whatever came to hand \u2013 cans of beer, jackets \u2013 to smother the fire, leaving the car a smoky hole, and the back seat half destroyed by flame. And they hadn\u2019t even reached the M3. Dawn was breaking by the time they reached London. The Driver dropped off The Wolf and The Disco King, and headed home. At last, to sleep. He unlocked the door of his flat, desperate to get to his bed. But there was his girlfriend. \u201cYou promised me you\u2019d take me wherever I wanted today, because you don\u2019t have to have the car back until tomorrow.\u201d \u201cBut I want to sleep. I have to sleep. You don\u2019t understand the night I\u2019ve had.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not my fault. You promised.\u201d The Driver sighed. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d \u201cLongleat.\u201d Having driven all the way from Glastonbury, overnight, through flames and death, The Driver now had to get back in the burned-out car, and go back exactly the way he had come, back down the M3, back down the A303. But at least his girlfriend would be happy. While Kurt Vile noodles away in the background, I shall take advantage to share this. It\u2019s long, so I\u2019m breaking it up. My favourite Glastonbury story involves three minor functionaries of the music industry \u2013 we shall call them The Driver, The Disco King, and The Wolf \u2013 and a series of very unfortunate and sometimes illegal events. They had spent the weekend \u2013 this was some years ago \u2013 partaking very enthusiastically of all Glastonbury had to offer. Which made their decision to drive back on the Sunday evening, in the rented car The Driver had persuaded his boss to splash out for, all the more peculiar. Still, they were very happy with their decision, fleeing the site before the flood from the car parks had become horrific, and made good time to the A303, the road from hell. As darkness enveloped them, the effects of the weekend began to take their toll. Suddenly they were jolted to attention by the sound of a massive smash against the front of the car. They pulled over to the hard shoulder, and walked back. There, at the side of the road, was a dead deer. (I should say that in some versions of the story, it was a crow, and it was flattened against the windscreen.) \u201cDo we have to call the police because we\u2019ve had an accident?\u201d asked The Driver. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d The Wolf said. \u201cNot like this! Get back in the car! We\u2019ve got to run!\u201d And they did. The Driver concentrated on the road, The Wolf beside him, chivvying him away from the scene of the crime. And then they noticed something. A smell. The smell of burning. BBC2 - Janet Jackson from earlier BBC4 - Foals and Neneh Cherry from earlier (but not at the same time) iPlayer - Liam Gallagher without his Parka iPlayer - Bastille (\u201cmust watch Glastonbury\u201d) iPlayer - Kurt Vile Next on - Courteeners, who could sell out Glastonbury themselves if it were just called Bury and held in Lancashire Next on - Jungle, the sound of the west London suburbs in 1985, and I don\u2019t mean that in a good way Next on - Bugzy Malone. And that\u2019s your current TV lot. I was watching the end of Sharon Van Etten\u2019s glorious set, but Laura Snapes tells me Liam dedicated Champagne Supernova to Keith Flint. Hey, can we all stop calling it Glasto? It\u2019s always been Nbury. And Sharon Van Etten is following Black Boys on Mopeds with Seventeen. This is glorious. I\u2019m a big fan of this kind of early 80s soft rock reconditioned for the 21st century. It\u2019s ecstatic and melancholic and makes you long for a past you never lived. Michael Cragg may dwarf Janet Jackson, but he still bows before her. If you are not watching Sharon Van Etten covering Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s Black Boys on Mopeds, you are missing A TREAT. \u201cChris Martin just admired the gong bath in the healing fields,\u201d according to Guardian photographer Alicia Canter. Back when he was still with Gwyneth Paltrow, my wife saw Chris Martin in the cafe at London Zoo with his kids. He was not giving them macrobiotic quinoa salads. He was giving them KP crisps. Bet he didn\u2019t tell Gwyneth that when he got home, the rascal. Over on the iPlayer, to the John Peel Stage where Sharon Van Etten is playing. Do watch: her most recent album, Remind Me Tomorrow, is fabulous, and the shows she did earlier this year were sensational. I hope I haven\u2019t missed Seventeen. And I love her turn of phrase. This, from I Told You Everything, is wonderful: \u201cSitting at the bar, I told you everything / You said, \u2018Holy shit, you almost died.\u2019 \u201d Laura Barton interviewed her earlier this year, and you can read it here if so you wish. Our own Michael Cragg and Chris Godfrey report that they were in a press group brought into the presence of Janet Jackson. They were not allowed to ask any questions. But Janet asked how tall Michael is \u2013 he\u2019s about 11 feet. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and he towers over me \u2013 and then he made her stand on a chair to have her photo taken with him. And here\u2019s the Late Nite Tuff Guy remix of When I Think of You. Glastonbury has never been very good at keeping a secret, but even by its standards, the news that Foals were the Park Stage\u2019s secret set was spread ridiculously widely. Long before they appeared on stage the place was packed, bringing to mind the logjam that accompanied Radiohead\u2019s secret set here eight years ago. That Foals attract that level of attention will come as a surprise to anyone who still associates them with diffident mathiness, but what is clear from this muscular set is that they\u2019re very much a proper \u201crock\u201d band now, boasting big riffs and arms aloft choruses. Mountain at My Gates offers plenty of the former and prompts a frenetic most pit, while the irrepressibly catchy My Number delivers on the latter front. Foals are in the big leagues \u2013 the secret is out. Low are on the telly, filmed earlier on the John Peel stage, and it\u2019s rather more tuneful than Liam is being. And Alan Sparhawk\u2019s soloing is incandescent, in a skronky, Neil Young sort of a way. Who\u2019d have thought they would be hitting a career high, decades on? Shockwave, his newest single, perks things up a bit. But a fiver says the commonest conversation among those in front of the Pyramid Stage is some variant of \u201cDo you think he\u2019s going to do Cigarettes and Alcohol?\u201d OK, there\u2019s no way around it. That version of For What It\u2019s Worth was pretty horrible. An apology song delivered with all the sensitivity of someone excusing themselves for not doing the washing up by saying it wasn\u2019t them who had the bloody beans, so why should they have to scrape off the dried sauce from the pan, oh, all right, I\u2019ll put it on to soak, how\u2019s that? Happy now? Hmmm. Removing the electric guitars and going all mellow is rather highlighting Liam\u2019s issues with high notes, isn\u2019t it? Just so you can see what Liam is \u201cfreezing\u201d in \u2026 Here\u2019s a typically good value Liam interview, by our own Alexis Petridis, from last year. For a while it seemed as though Liam was going to be the new subject for the old joke about his brother \u2013 \u201cHave you seen Noel Gallagher\u2019s put out a new album to promote his latest round of interviews?\u201d \u2013 but he very much appears to be BACK BACK BACK these days. He hadn\u2019t even got to the end of his first song before people started assessing his set \u2026 Good to see him addressing the Parka issue, though. \u201cDon\u2019t wear the Parka, you\u2019ll die. Now I\u2019m freezing me tits off up here,\u201d made me laugh. For what it\u2019s worth, I think this is sounding agreeably brutal. Obviously, they bought the organ from a greengrocer, what with its slogan of ROCK \u2018N\u2019 ROLL. And he walks on to huge cheers to open with Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Star. Or ROCK \u2018N\u2019 ROLL STAR. He didn\u2019t carry out his threat to wear a Parka, but I bet he\u2019s going to be sweating like me at an all-pork buffet in that top. What\u2019s it like standing in the middle of the crowd at the Pyramid? When I went I stood way off at the side. It looks terrifying being in the middle of that many people \u2026 Clearly, everyone at Glastonbury is talking about the big headline set tonight. But will Hawkwind on the acoustic stage at 9.40pm be able to top Stormzy last night? And will it be even odder than their orchestral shows last year, with Mike Batt of the Wombles conducting? At the Palladium in London, a furious man behind me stood up and shouted: \u201cFrom Austria I came for this shit! From Austria! Shit!\u201d It\u2019s likely Hawkwind playing acoustically will be too much for The Man, so expect the BBC to pay more attention to the Killers (onstage at 9.45pm), and Liam Gallagher (7.15pm, though the live TV doesn\u2019t start til 7.30) on the Pyramid Stage. The Other stage brings us Sigrid (on right now), then the Courteeners, and finally the Chemical Brothers. There\u2019s Wu-Tang Clan and Jungle on West Holts; Sean Paul, Bugzy Malone and the brilliant Sharon Van Etten on the John Peel Stage; and Hot Chip, Kate Tempest and Kurt Vile on at The Park. But let\u2019s be honest, nothing can beat the 1970 festival. Mad Mick! Free milk! Can you, in all good conscience, listen to the Smiths in 2019, knowing what you know about the views of their erstwhile lead singer? It\u2019s a knotty problem, but Johnny Marr has found a solution. He\u2019ll sing the songs himself, removing the problematic aspect altogether. Job sorted. Sure, he can\u2019t quite match the croon of He Who Shall Not Be Named, but nor does he have a For Britain badge pinned to his lapel. Starting \u2013 fittingly \u2013 with Bigmouth Strikes Again, Marr rattles through a set peppered with Smiths classics. Inevitably tracks from his most recent album, Call the Comet, can\u2019t help but feel anticlimactic in comparison but a welcome airing of Getting Away With It from his Electronic days provides a helpful reminder that Marr\u2019s career doesn\u2019t begin and end with that other bloke. It\u2019s Saturday night at Glastonbury, for 170,000 people. And it\u2019s Saturday night on the sofa for me, Michael Hann, taking over from Ben and Laura as they go off to revel, and I finish off my Fruit Pastilles lolly and prepare for five hours of merriment. Feel free to tweet me \u2013 @michaelahann \u2013 with tips on what to watch on the telly or the iPlayer, and any observations. To a casual observer, Lizzo may seem brand new, suddenly experiencing her breakthrough moment in 2019. But the truth is that she\u2019s been grafting ever since she released her debut album Lizzobangers in 2013. As she sweeps onto the West Holts stage at Glastonbury, a star in a cloud of glitter and chiffon, she\u2019s keen to remind us of the long journey she\u2019s had up to this point. \u201cLast time we played Glastonbury, it was 2013, and there was two people in the crowd,\u201d she announces. But now? \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of y\u2019all motherfuckers.\u201d Fresh from a set on Thursday in Milwaukee for Summerfest, where she alleges that security staff \u201cslapped and manhandled\u201d her stylists in a racist attack, Lizzo appears more dignified and defiant than ever. Flanked by her Big Girls, delivering tirelessly athletic choreography in black leotards, and swigging from a bottle of Patron, she blazes through a set that includes her 2019 hits \u2013 the Missy Elliot-featuring Tempo, and the bass-heavy Boys among them \u2013 as well as older, would-be hits, like 2016\u2019s infectious Scuse Me. As well as the back catalogue of an older star, Lizzo shows the crowd at every possible moment that she\u2019s a quadruple threat: a soul singer (she interpolates Respect and No Scrubs during the set), a rapper, a dancer, and a flautist, dashing off not one but two flute solos during her biggest hits, Truth Hurts and Juice. Some of her droll interjections might encourage you to add comedian to the list, too. But what she\u2019s arguably most well known for, and what she brings to Glastonbury in spades, is her gospel of self-love. The crowd, who scream adoringly for such a long time at one point that Lizzo begins twerking to the sound, are eating from the palm of her hand as she instructs us to grab the person next to us, and tell them that they can do anything. \u201cI\u2019m gonna keep loving myself like its the honeymoon,\u201d she announces. Its clear that, however long she\u2019s been grafting for, this crowd is firmly in the honeymoon period with her too. The photographers are understandably in love with Janet\u2019s hair. Forget Janet, forget Foals, because it\u2019s about to get Seriously Romantic over on the Acoustic stage. And the secret Park set is... Foals! They\u2019re just kicking off now. Janet Jackson is burning through her set with an unbelievably tight band and set of backing dancers. If I Was Your Girl, Control, All for You, The Best Things in Life Are Free and more have all been deployed and we\u2019re only 30 minutes in. Massive bonus points for playing R&amp;B Junkie \u2013 one of her greatest deep cuts. Full review coming soon! I have never had a more welcome ice cream in my life. Vanilla and peanut butter and chocolate double scoop from Shepherds in the Greenpeace area, made with sheep\u2019s milk in Hay-on-Wye. Gloriously clean and light and under a fiver \u2013 next time I\u2019m going for the sesame and honey which is pure Ottolenghi genius in action. And maybe some other flavours too. All weekend, in homage to Janet Jackson\u2019s epic Control, we\u2019ve been asking punters what they would do if they were put in charge of Glastonbury. Most of their requests have revolved around water and shade. Proving that JJ is truly the one in control, she appears to have summoned a light covering of cloud and an extremely welcome temperature drop in the moments before she appears on the Pyramid stage. We stan a meteorological legend, etc. \u201cGlastonbury, do you like rock\u2019n\u2019roll?\u201d, Lewis Capaldi asks the sprawling Other stage crowd at the start of his set, as if about to launch into a rollicking Great Balls of Fire. And then, with perfect comic timing: \u201cWell, you have come to the wrong fucking set my friends. However, if you like questionably chubby young men from Scotland to sing sad songs, you\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d And boy, are they sad. So universally so that they start to bleed into one another like the ink on a tear-stained love letter. Beats from Carl Cox\u2019s four-hour set in the Glade cut into Capaldi\u2019s more spartan songs like a mate telling him to cheer up. Had it been raining, as it so often does at Glastonbury, this could have been insufferably dreary. But Capaldi has such charisma, and such a beautifully burnished soul voice, that the majority of this set is engaging, at times moving. Read Ben Beaumont-Thomas\u2019s full review Mary-Ellen, 57, ex-nurse, campaigner \u201cI like purple in particular and I sing in a choir where red is our colour so I have red roses on my chair. People don\u2019t approach disabled people because they are taught not to stare \u2013 having things like this on my chair breaks down that barrier. I have been going to Glastonbury since 2001 \u2013 the Green Futures area is the best place to be.\u201d Aaron Molloy, 33, musician and cafe owner \u201cThis is my ruff \u2013 I like it for the pow! My friend made it, things like this seem to follow me around. I will wear this on stage when I perform, but I would also wear it down Brixton market. I loved seeing Extinction Rebellion \u2013 I felt like I was in the 60s.\u201d Tony Myers, 61, works for the NHS \u201cWe knew the pier was going to be here \u2013 Glastonbury-on-Sea \u2013 so we decided a hanky and rolled-up trousers would be good. It\u2019s like Gumby from Monty Python. I make the gates at Glastonbury. This is the first time I have dressed up \u2013 people have been taking photos. It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s a place on the planet where you can wear something like this and know everyone else will be dressed up.\u201d As far as stage riders go, socks don\u2019t occupy the same legendary status as, say, \u201cfruit and flowers\u201d, or M&amp;Ms with all the brown ones taken out. But for permanently shirtless Northampton rapper Slowthai over on the West Holts Sstage, they\u2019re unexpectedly key: he chucks his socks and shoes off during his first song, but then realises the error of his ways, yelling: \u201cWhere are my socks? It\u2019s so hot I\u2019m going to blister my feet!\u201d Enter \u201cRick\u201d and a comedy sequence whileduring which the audience waits for said socks to adorn Slowthai\u2019s feet before he launches into a pulverising rendition of Drug Dealer, from his incisive debut album, Nothing Great About Britain. His set is full of quotable moments: \u201cShout out the K-hole, it\u2019s taken hold of me too many times\u201d; \u201cmMandem don\u2019t forget to make your girl cum, otherwise you\u2019re not doing it right\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m tripping balls\u201d; a singalong to Wonderwall that seems incongruous at first but isn\u2019t, really \u2013 his swagger and cheeky boyish charm are pure Liam Gallagher. It\u2019s goofy stuff \u2013 he\u2019s obsessed with the mosh pit, constantly telling the audience to make it bigger, and bringing on Loyle Carner to gee people into creating a vortex \u2013 but none of it quashes the undeniable sense that Slowthai is one of British rap\u2019s best new talents. Only the day after Stormzy\u2019s headline set, which marked a formative moment for British rap finally leaving its American shadow behind, Slowthai\u2019s relentless energy and restless creativity \u2013 raw and guttural, as in tune to punk and he is jazz \u2013 marks out the promise of excellent things to come. He\u2019s so boyishly charming that he gets away with playing Drug Dealer twice. The mosh pit is wild and unwieldy, reflecting the chaos that underpins Slowthai\u2019s blazing talent. Glastonbury\u2019s newest dance stage is a giant head filled with avant-garde club music. Here\u2019s a time-lapse video of it being built. Just when you thought Jeff Goldblum and his jazz orchestra (playing the West Holts tomorrow) had the award for strangest Glasto novelty act sewn up, here\u2019s a strong challenger. Fun Lovin\u2019 Crime Writers are a six-piece covers band made up of thriller authors, including on vocals one Val McDermonid. And you know what \u2013 despite all the self-deprecating gags made about \u201cmurdering songs\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re actually pretty tight. McDermonid, it turns out, has a decent set of pipes on her, barrelling through Sweet\u2019s glam classic Block Bbuster and doing her best Bowie on The Jean Genie. There\u2019s a playfulness in their song choices, too, with all of them on a crime theme \u2013 Psycho Killer and I Predict a Riot make appearances. Crucially, they don\u2019t outstay their welcome, even if the third encore appearance of Whisky in the Jar is a shade self-indulgent. Over to you, Goldblum! If it wasn\u2019t steamy enough at Glasto already, then the Love Synth Orchestra, playing the songs of Barry White, took it up a notch in the heat stakes. A star cast including Gruff Rhys, Lianne La Havas, Nadine Shah, jaw-dropping saxophonist YolandDa Brown and more joined an ensemble of players from the British Paraorchestra and Army of Generals orchestras, wielding synths and taking the bassy one\u2019s songs to a cosmic, joyful level. Shah\u2019s warm baritone lifted MyYour\u2019e the First, the Last, My Everything, as Gruff held up his customary signs, asking the crowd to applause at the right time and then to let out a holy roar. With so many players crammed on to the stage, it could have been a jumble but the result \u2013 led by conductor Charles Hazlewood, resplendent in a loud jacquard suit \u2013 was a gloriously uplifting take on Barry White\u2019s baby-makers. Via Ben Beaumont-Thomas: \u201cLewis Capaldi opened his set with a video of Noel Gallagher saying modern music is \u2018wank\u2019 and asking \u2018who\u2019s this Capaldi feller?\u2019 And then comes out dressed as Noel Gallagher in a parka. And then unzips it to reveal a T-shirt depicting Noel inside a heart.\u201d Who has just started on the West Holts stage. Caspar Llewellyn Smith sends this: \u201cSlowthai is immediately brilliant: after taking his white sports socks off, he complains that the stage is far too hot on his feet. Cue the comedy of trying to find where he put them and only starting again once he\u2019s comfortably clothed: straight into Drug Dealer and a huge mosh pit appearing in front of the stage.\u201d An eye-wateringly enormous crowd has amassed for Ezra Collective, the UK jazz scene\u2019s very own boy band from south London. It feels like a flashpoint for the movement \u2013 proof, if any was needed, of how it has taken root and continued to nudge overground. Ezra trade exclusively in good vibes, which is perfect for a sweltering Saturday afternoon. They use their platform to urge people to bring joy into their lives, and it doesn\u2019t feel contrived. \u201cToo much of the media is about negativity among young people,\u201d says drummer and bandleader Femi Koleoso, with the charisma of a younger Stormzy. \u201cAnd we want to be a beacon of positivity.\u201d Their set does indeed radiate warmth and a refreshing vigour: laid-back brass, delicate keys that twinkle like sunbeams and drums that bang like an old-school hip-hop track. Most of their songs swirl around a variety of black music genres that reflects one of the beacons of London diversity, Notting Hill Carnival: not just jazz but dub, afrobeat, jungle, grime and soul. Guests help to break up the jams: they bring out collaborator Jorja Smith for their single Reason in Disguise from their latest album, You Can\u2019t Feel My Joy, then Loyle Carner comes through for What Am I to Do, underlining how UK soul, hip-hop and jazz do not have to be mutually exclusive. \u201cWe wrote this song for the people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay their rent but still bought a ticket to Glastonbury,\u201d Koleoso says before set closer For Pablo, a spiritual Fela Kuti-indebted party jam, which is what they do best. Boundaries feel like they\u2019re being broken, not just in terms of ridding jazz if its stuffy image but also in terms of the lines between genres dissolving: Ezra aren\u2019t just one of the best new UK jazz bands \u2013 they\u2019re one of the UK\u2019s best new bands full-stop. Lottie, 25: \u201cI\u2019d run an actual train along the train tracks so people can get to stages faster. There\u2019s no shelter too \u2013 I\u2019d plant some nice acacia trees to provide shade, otherwise everyone is getting burnt to a crisp. For the music, I\u2019d have Bruce Springsteen headlining every single day because he\u2019s the Boss!\u201d \u201cNot vegan \u2013 but from a Dartmoor farm that\u2019s part of the Farm Wilder wildlife-friendly sustainable agriculture scheme, so I thought it was probably allowed. Made from 28-day aged rib-eye cap pasture-fed beef, with Somerset cheddar and proper crispy bacon, Nelly\u2019s Barn Burgers near the Park also do (soya-based) vegan burgers if that\u2019s your thing. If it isn\u2019t though, try this.\u201d Even in this age of streaming-assisted overnight megastardom, it seems more than a little remarkable that an unsigned artist \u2013 who released his debut album after crowdfunding the cost of production \u2013 has not only earned a plum afternoon slot on one of Glastonbury\u2019s biggest stages but packed it out to such a degree that thousands of fans are stuck outside. It\u2019s possibly the most oversubscribed gig at the John Peel tent since the Killers played a secret set here in 2017. And given they\u2019re headliners this time around, you get a sense of the exalted company the Glasgow singer-songwriter born Gerry Crosbie finds himself in these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a wee revolution starting,\u201d he says. Still, if it is a revolution, it\u2019s one built on pretty traditional foundations. Crosbie\u2019s brand of optimistic pop-folk feels almost cynical in its mass appeal: relentlessly major key and full of shout-along choruses that seem geared towards festival singalongs and home insurance ads. If you\u2019re not a fan, a little of it goes a long way \u2013 though none of the masses at the John Peel stage seem terribly concerned about that. Millie Sandy, 21, textile design student \u201cI got such bad sunburn yesterday and this dress is really good for this weather. I found the hat in a charity shop and I made the earrings using a fork! I was looking forward to seeing Tame Impala - I had seen them once before but I was quite drunk.\u201d Christy and Antonio Fadden, 9 and 7. Christy and Antonio\u2019s mum: \u201cWe came from Northern Ireland \u2013 the boat landed at 6.30am on Friday so we have only just got here really. They wanted to have different colours because they\u2019re not the same. They\u2019ll have it \u2019til September when they go back to school.\u201d Richard Hembling, 36, Formula 1 cameraman \u201cI had a similar pair of trousers when I came two years ago. I like getting in the festival spirit and my mum always told me it was better to seen to be safe. This is my second time. It was good enough to miss work \u2013 I would have been in Austria this weekend.\u201d Greenpeace have already run out of their homemade Marmite produced from brewing waste (which I thought Marmite was made from anyway, but could be wrong \u2013 I only eat the stuff by the gallon) \u2013 however, they are selling a really superb root and kale crisp (bear with me) bap on fresh sourdough to make up for this salty disappointment. The crisps are fried in olive oil, which came all the way from Spain on a sailing boat \u2013 very Leonard Cohen, but also very delicious. Recommend when the temperature drops below 30C. It\u2019s a packed Left Field tent for a panel called How to Save Our Planet (no pressure!), with Caroline Lucas in particular given a rock-star welcome. Chaired by the Guardian\u2019s own John Harris, fellow panellists are Clive Lewis, 16-year-old activist George Bond, Minnie Rahman of Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and Barbara from the excellently named Fracking Nannas (\u201cIf I can get involved in activism in my late 50s, anyone can\u201d). It\u2019s possible that the large turnout is down to the stifling heat (the climate crisischange, guys) pushing people into the respite of the shade \u2013 I spot a few weary nappers \u2013 but more likely it is because climate activism has blown up in big way in the last year. The sense of urgency seems to have cut through, as we\u2019ve seen with Extinction Rebellion (who marched to the Stone Circle yesterday). The vibe is mostly positive and optimistic. Someone asks a question on how we can help move away from the doom-and-gloom narrative in general \u2013 but important points are made by Rahman and Lewis in particular about how social justice, racial justice and climate justice are linkedconnected. George and Barbara are inspiration detailing their direct action. Lucas talks the Green New Deal, and a mention of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is greeted with a huge cheer. George throws out a date to remember: the on 20th September, he says, there will be \u201cthe largest climate demonstration this country\u2019s has ever seen. It\u2019s gonna be huge, it\u2019s gonna be beautiful, but it\u2019s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.\u201d Mark it in the calendar. And she had some excellent facial expressions. It\u2019s T-two hours (I have no idea what T stands for in this equation) until Janet Jackson graces the main stage, and Glastonbury\u2019s punters have more ideas about what they\u2019d do if they were put in charge. At this stage on a sweltering Saturday afternoon, when everyone\u2019s body feels like a fleshy rockery covered in dozens of tiny sweat waterfalls, it\u2019s no surprise that they mostly concern water, whether for washing or guzzling. Alex: \u201cI\u2019d to see Nicolas Jaar on the Pyramid stage playing a really full-on set. And a deadly water slide.\u201d Jon: \u201cI\u2019d give everyone free leg rubdowns at 4am. Lower back massages for all. And a massive slip and slide.\u201d Kerry: \u201cI\u2019d make more facilities for toilets and I\u2019d have Coldplay headline every year. I know Chris Martin came on with Stormzy last night, but unfortunately we were up at Shangri-La. People should be going around with ice and water.\u201d Frank: \u201cLike at a race course. And more shaded seating areas. Fleetwood Mac is our shared dream headliner.\u201d Connie: \u201cI would have better toilets and more water stations so that there\u2019s less queues everywhere. More stalls for things like milk on your way back to the campsites. My dream headliner would be Ariana Grande. She doesn\u2019t do that many performances in England and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been to Glastonbury.\u201d Felicity Cloake\u2019s food tour: pukka pakoras Vegetable pakora at the Permaculture Cafe \u2013 \u201cthe only food grown and eaten on site\u201d and cooked on a wood fire, served with green tomato chutney and kimchi. Crunchy and packed with veg, this is definitely the best \u00a33 we\u2019ve spent so far, but go early because apparently later the queues are enormous (though I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very chilled out). Ben Randm, 35, standup comedian \u201cThis outfit is about bringing Tame Impala joy to life. I like leopard because it\u2019s lairy. I like the robe because it\u2019s shamanic. Inclusivity, that\u2019s what it is all about. I\u2019m practical, too \u2013 these scarves aren\u2019t just scarves, they\u2019re wristbands to wipe my forehead.\u201d Tom Shepherd, 16, school-leaver \u201cI have seen quite a few of these hats, some with a mohawk. I liked the horns, and the Jack Daniels logo. I bought it here, and the sunglasses, too. I have been to Glastonbury the last four times. I don\u2019t dress like this normally \u2013 I usually wear dark things. My favourite band is AC/DC \u2013 my dad is into them.\u201d That stab-proof vest that Stormzy wore on stage last night? Designed by Banksy, it turns out. Comedians, musicians and friends of Jeremy Hardy gathered to celebrate the late comic and Glastonbury regular in a special event this lunchtime. Appearing in Hardy\u2019s customary early afternoon slot at the Cabaret tent, performers including Mark Steel, Seann Walsh, Katherine Williams and Billy Bragg performed standup, songs and stories in memory of Hardy, who died earlier this year after a battle with of cancer. The tone was celebratory rather than funereal, with plenty of pointed digs aimed at the current Conservative leadership campaign. Hardy, a staunch supporter of the Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn, was known for lending his comedy a strong activist bent both on stage and on Radio 4 panels shows such as Just a Minute. Yet, as political comedian Steel, a close friend said, Hardy wanted to change the world and have fun doing it. That sense of mischief was underlined by a clip of Hardy performing Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah in the style of George Formby. As the tribute concluded, Steel led the audience in a chorus of his tweaked version of the Corbyn chant that took the festival by storm two years ago. \u201cOh Jeremy Hardy,\u201d he sang, prompting what will surely turn out to be one of the most rousing singalongs of the weekend. Glastonbury have put out a statement about reports concerning water shortages at this year\u2019s festivals \u2013 after showers have been temporarily shut off across the site. There is not a water shortage at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. Our supply is running as normal. As always in hot weather, demand for water has increased, so we have put in place the usual restrictions on staff/guest showers and the limited number of public showers. We have more than 850 taps on site, all of which provide free drinking water. These taps all have a ready supply of water. All bars are also offering free tap water. And although we no longer sell water in single-use bottles, all of our food traders are selling both water and soft drink in cans. There is also not a shortage of this canned water, which is available for those who wish to purchase it. Water is also being given out from our Iinfo points and we have roving teams providing water from backpacks. So far, the on-site ambulance control have had just 27 heat-related calls for assistance, covering the 200,000+-plus people on site. There may be queues for taps at some of the busier places, so we ask everyone to be patient and to look for taps in quieter areas of the site. Thank you. Here\u2019s some more superfans down the front of the Pyramid stage, enduring the heat to get up close and personal with their faves. Antony \u201cI\u2019m a massive Janet Jackson fan. This is my fourth Glastonbury and I was so excited when they announced that she was playing because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get a chance to see her again. She clashes with Lizzo, which is a tough choice to make, but it\u2019s got to be Janet. I\u2019ve got my water, I\u2019ve eaten \u2013 now just for That\u2019s the Way Love Goes. Tony and Jo \u201cWe\u2019re going to be right at the front for Janet, Kylie and Miley. We love it camped out here stage-side \u2013 we\u2019ve done it for Foo Fighters, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, and they were some of the best shows I\u2019ve ever seen. With older acts like Janet, you never quite know what you\u2019re going to get but we\u2019re hoping she\u2019ll smash it just like Barry Gibb did a couple of years ago.\u201d Next up to play I\u2019m in Control, where we ask Glastonbury-goers what they would do if they were in charge, is Corinne. \u201cIn general, I\u2019d love there to be more showers, there aren\u2019t any in the general camping areas [the festival says it is limiting shower access to conserve water today]. Also, more water stations would be handy, and maybe more sheltered areas for the sun or the rain. I can\u2019t really think of a headliner \u2026 Actually, I\u2019d love for Madonna to do it. I heard a rumour she was going to do it this year, so I\u2019d love her to do it in 2020.\u201d Carrie Underwood is having her mind blown at the Pyramid stage. \u201cI have never seen event security pass out water to people before. It\u2019s a beautiful thing!\u201d She\u2019s a long way from the corporate enormo-domes that the country star plays in her native US. Underwood says they had no idea what wellies were until it was suggested they get some just in case \u2013 and the crowd is initially a little sparse, a little wary of the sight of two fiddles and a banjo at Saturday lunchtime. But Underwood\u2019s rock bona fides start drawing in curious onlookers: on Cowboy Casanova, she pulls off a battering vocal run that makes its vengeful sentiment (\u201cYou better run for your life\u201d) even more brilliantly menacing; she punks up Just a Dream, and belts so hard on Blown Away that the veins on the side of her head pop. Plus, she\u2019s often found standing atop a black pyramid, contributing electric and acoustic guitar to her eight-piece band\u2019s brawny chug. It\u2019d be easy to approach Underwood with preconceptions \u2013 blond, country, non\u2013partisan \u2013 but there\u2019s an unapologetic libidinousness (Last Name\u2019s lusty bewilderment about getting with a guy purely on first name terms) and femininity (\u201cYou can\u2019t cry pretty\u201d) to her songs that earns her a place in country\u2019s outlaw lineage, bringing the margins of women\u2019s lives into a genre that has, recently, sought to sideline their experiences despite them being foundational country touchstones. She looks beyond them, too: although Love Wins isn\u2019t exactly Relax when it comes to a full-throated celebration of queerness, in country terms it\u2019s something close to that. Also she chucks in a verse from George Michael\u2019s Freedom 90, which turns out to make an excellent country rager. Our photographer David Levene was at the side of the stage for Jorja Smith\u2019s West Holts set, and got some beautiful shots. What better way to celebrate 15 years of Transgressive Records than burrowing down a rabbit hole? The forward-thinking indie label celebrated its milestone birthday at Glastonbury last night by taking over one of its most beloved and secretive areas, the Rabbit Hole, complete with a crawl-through entrance (seriously, you are not allowed to stand) and dancers dressed as playing cards. As well as the Transgressive DJs keeping up the birthday party vibes with R&amp;B bangers and the occasional Fatboy Slim moment, there was an appearance from 18-year-old poet Arlo Parks, and a lively, very sweaty throwback set from the Mystery Jets. Unfortunately there was a slight dampener on proceedings, though, when at 3am a man dressed as a rabbit in sunglasses announced that the label\u2019s most recent and compelling success story, the experimental freak-pop duo Let\u2019s Eat Grandma, would no longer be performing. The weird and wonderful evening was a suitably joyful celebration of all that Transgressive have achieved in the past 15 years, though sadly missed an integral, shining part of their future. Lauren Cochrane here \u2013 I\u2019m a senior fashion writer at the Guardian, and have been going round the site to find the greatest outfits and people who are managing to stay chic in 30C weather. First up: Laura Murray, 25, who works for British Heart Foundation. \u201cThis dress is from the 70s \u2013 when I scored it from eBay I did a little celebratory dance. I like things that are a bit retro, and I think the clown hat will help me blend in with the Circus field. This is an exaggerated version of what I wear away from Glastonbury, but I always like to reuse clothes \u2013 and save the planet that way.\u201d Next up is 27-year-old marine pilot Josh Clerk. \u201cThe outfit felt natural today \u2013 I let my inner animal out. It\u2019s very comfortable, too. Is leopard a trend? It\u2019s one I am setting. I have never been to Glastonbury before. There is something for everyone, and you can be as weird as you like.\u201d More fabulousness to come later on the liveblog \u2026 In a particularly low period in the late noughties, I had a pulled-pork burrito loaded up with guacamole and sour cream every Friday as a treat. Then I quit my job and gave up burritos for at least a decade. On the plus side, this vegan BBQ pulled-jackfruit number from Club Mexicana is unlikely to impede my recovery, because it tastes so healthy it\u2019s almost like eating a salad wrap \u2013 but something a bit salty and spicy and fatty in there wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss to balance that tangy, sweet BBQ sauce. Not pork though, obviously. I\u2019ve been down the front of the Pyramid stage, where people are planning to stay all day \u2013 in this heat! \u2013 to ensure a perfect view of their favourite artists. First up is Janet Jackson fan Matt. \u201cI\u2019m here for Janet Jackson; I absolutely love her and have always listened to her music. I\u2019ve been to Glastonbury many, many times and I try to get to the front a lot as nothing compares to being that close and personal with these superstars \u2013 you can almost touch them. I was here yesterday too and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d Christine \u201cThis is my first Glastonbury and I\u2019m so excited for the Killers and Janet Jackson. I used to listen to Janet when I was younger so her set will bring back some special memories I\u2019m sure. The Killers are a fantastic band too \u2013 I\u2019m here for the Mr Brightside singalong and then I have to go back to my job at the medical tent at midnight. At least with that in my head it\u2019ll keep me energised!\u201d While the chief put sunshine on the Pyramid stage, the Reid twins knocked out a Joyful Kilmarnock Blues you could have heard in Ayrshire. There was some banter, but not too much; there were some solos but they didn\u2019t overdo it. This was a slick, blast-through of the big numbers as the crowd sweltered, swayed, leapt and danced in the midday heat. I\u2019m On My Way was an irresistible singalong, Sunshine on Leith was the heartbreaking highlight and I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) ended a knockout 45-minute slot. The Scottish fans were in raptures: What could be more ideal at a baking Glastonbury than a nice trip to the beach? This year the festival\u2019s unveiled a 70-metre-long pier called Glastonbury-on-Sea, only, well, there\u2019s no water to cool down in and from a distance it looks a chance to show off some high-grade decking. For non-wood enthusiasts, it also represents the opportunity to be transported to any gloriously tacky seaside town, apparently from the 1960s. (In the queue to get in I heard a \u201clifeguard\u201d say: \u201cNice breasts, I mean breaststroke\u201d at a passing punter.) So there\u2019s a sweet shop selling Glasto rock, you can have your fortune told by a man wearing a halo of stuffed gloves, stock up on souvenirs (branded socks! Lighters! Tea towels!!), play in the amusements, watch some Punch and Judy, and from the crowds of people perched on the end of the pier, it\u2019s a great spot to update your Instagram. In the central bandstand, animatronic robots reminiscent of the white lovers in Bjork\u2019s All Is Full of Love video gyrate about, while a mechanical wheelie bin produces two boxing gloves at the touch of a button. And, if you\u2019re keen to see your breakfast/lunch/dinner again, there\u2019s some suitably rickety-looking bumper cars just outside soundtracked, like all good fun-fair rides should be, by Sean Paul. There are also Redcoats dotted about. I spoke to Will and Jess, and both seemed to be adamant the Spice Girls will appear at some point tomorrow. What are you doing exactly? W: We are Redcoats, so we\u2019re assisting people and making sure they have a lovely time. Wearing really incredible hats. J: Yes exactly. We\u2019re meant to be emulating sort of 50s and 60s redcoats. W: This is the first year and we\u2019ve got it for the next five years at least. It\u2019s an amazing feat of engineering. A lot of work has gone into it. It would be lovely if there was some cool water underneath to cool off in. J: Imagine. Even if it was just some cool mist spraying every now and then. I might propose that next year. Have you been on the dodgems? J: Not yet, but we\u2019re going to later. I think they stop them at the right time, about six-ish, so before people are too pissed. In honour of Janet Jackson and her seminal hit Control \u2013 which will get an airing on the Pyramid stage during her set at 5.45pm \u2013 we\u2019ve been asking Glastonbury punters what they would do if they were in control of the festival. Here\u2019s Ngaio, 29, from Bristol, giving her best Janet pose while she\u2019s at it. \u201cI would make sure there were more stages making a 50/50 gender split and bring collectives of colour to run their own venues such as BBZ or gal-dem, or our collective which is called Booty Bass. I think the female run venue Sisterhood is a step in the right direction. It\u2019s important for people to feel safe in a venue and not harassed.\u201d We\u2019ve been asking Glastonbury punters what they would do if they were part of a people\u2019s assembly on Brexit. Next up with her solutions it\u2019s Emma, 22, from Bristol. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made the Brexit vote during Glastonbury, I think that jinxed it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as common for young people to be aware of the postal vote and they could have done a postal area at Glastonbury or made it clearer if there was one. I think it was a strategic move to do it during the festival.\u201d Extreme shade-seeking measures: a lady is sitting inside the coffee sign. Don\u2019t blame her. Drake, Adele, Wiley and David Lammy are among those who have paid tribute to Stormzy\u2019s performance last night \u2013 we\u2019ve rounded up all the reaction here. Starting the day with homemade kefir in a proper mug in the Permaculture cafe. I would have preferred a coffee if I\u2019m 100 % honest, but when at Glastonbury ... Also, apparently, it will give me flawless skin, put me in a brilliant mood and \u201cmight even make me experience the festival in an entirely new way\u201d, and you can\u2019t say that for a macchiato. A Glastonbury institution: Manic Organic have been at the festival for 33 years, and I reckon their manic breakfast would keep you going for at least half that time. Ploughing through a huge plate of fried potatoes, tomato and homemade vegan sausage mix was a tough job when the temperature must be over 30C without a breeze, but hey, someone\u2019s got to do it. Carbalicious! A giant industrial crane spewing out globules of oily fire may not seem like the most on-brand look for verdant, eco-conscious Glastonbury. Yet there is a tantalising hedonism in the opening of Bristol\u2013based rave stage Arcadia\u2019s Pangea on Friday night \u2013 a chance for revellers to indulge themselves and to have reason enough to seek out the Healing Fields the next day. Irish duo Bicep take their place within the crane, following opener the Black Madonna, as it rotates and spits fire, confetti, and shards of light on to a suitably refreshed crowd. Beginning with a selection of minimal, jittering deep house cuts, their seamless mixing is punctuated by yelps from the crowd each time a fireball erupts to the beat, before moving on to quick cuts of gut-churning techno taken straight from the DJ Stingray playbook. It was only an hour-long set, and it wasn\u2019t until the second half that things got properly moving, when Bicep showcased their own productions from their self\u2013titled debut album, ending on the infectious breakbeats of single Glue. The duo play with a focused intensity that provides the perfect backing to their theatrical setting. Water is being saved for drinking at Glastonbury, and the showers have been temporarily shut off to preserve it. It\u2019s another bump in the road after the festival banned plastic bottles from sale on site \u2013 which led in part to 40-minute queues for some of the water refill stations yesterday. Festival organisers are saying that there are no queues for most of them today, however. All weekend long at Glastonbury you\u2019ll hear rumours of secret sets due to happen: Florence and the Machine are playing an acoustic set in the Crow\u2019s Nest! Kylie\u2019s singing with Nick Cave at a backstage bar! Is that Craig David drinking a protein shake behind the DJ booth? Most of the rumours are, of course, unfounded but the Park stage is reliably starry \u2013 Pulp and Radiohead have appeared in previous years, and later today there\u2019ll be a \u201cmuch loved British band\u201d playing. And this morning, it\u2019s another turn from Sunday Pyramid stage players Vampire Weekend. The band were clearly pleased with the honour, and front man Ezra Koenig greeted the crowd with the line that \u201cthis really is the best stage, it\u2019s the vibiest\u201d, before launching into a set largely comprised of audience requests from their back catalogue. Spanning everything from B-sides like Giant to early hit Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa and the obscure Finger Back, Vampire Weekend showcase a formidable knowledge of their own work but also the breadth of their sound, taking in everything from synth\u2013pop to guitar-driven indie and highlife melodies. Koenig\u2019s falsetto is pitch-perfect throughout and the newly revamped band are precise and controlled. Rounding out the set with a joyous cover of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Everywhere, Vampire Weekend gave a taste of what is shaping up to be one of the Pyramid stage sets of the weekend tomorrow. Sitars faintly twinkle over Balearic house rhythms as Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet, serenades a packed morning crowd either running on the dregs of last night\u2019s festivities or the early morning sun at his breakfast DJ set on the Stonebridge stage. Delving deep into the ambient selections that characterised the more serene, pensive moments of his most recent album New Energy and 2003\u2019s Rounds, Hebden deftly mixes new age pan pipes into undulating breakbeats and washes of floating synths. With the sun shining over the Stonebridge tent, the atmosphere soon morphs into what can only be described as a neo-spiritual sweat lodge; dreadlocked cybergoths waving hands in the air, shirtless lads swaying like nearly-felled timber, perspiring couples locked in an embrace. Not one to play to expectations, though, Hebden soon disregards the spirituals in favour of the thumping house that has marked him out as one of the UK\u2019s most in-demand DJs and producers, taking this most varied of crowds along with him for the ride. An invigorating start to the second day\u2019s music. We spent last night dancing to Midland and Erick Morillo in NYC Downlow, punctuated by a Janet Jackson-themed drag performance \u2013 just one of endless options to thoroughly deprive yourself of sleep at Glastonbury. But it wasn\u2019t always thus, as Joe Muggs found in this feature looking at how Michael Eavis was finally won round to club culture. Everyone had been telling me I needed to try a Buddha Bowl (surely peak Glasto food), and now I have. And I can tell you that a pot of creamy vegan massaman curry and brown rice topped with steamed kale, carrot kimchi, seeds and (optional) grilled halloumi is nice... in the way that eating roast beef and prawn cocktail together because you\u2019ve got overexcited at the all-you-can-eat buffet is weirdly nice. The pineapple hidden at the bottom with the potato was a bit of a surprise, but frankly, if it contains halloumi, it\u2019s ok with me. Liam Gallagher is on later, and is clearly gearing up for a \u201cman\u2019s not hot\u201d moment. Catch him sweating profusely but pretending not to care at 7.15pm tonight. Tame Impala are in an unenviable position \u2013 around the corner from them a groundbreaking moment is taking place, as the first black British Pyramid headliner takes to the stage. And, when a burst of fireworks rockets up above the Pyramid, what seems like a significant proportion of the Other Stage crowd glances across enviously. It doesn\u2019t help that Kevin Parker\u2019s psych romanticists aren\u2019t quite providing enough pyrotechnics themselves. This is largely the same set the band played here in 2016, give or take a pair of recent-ish singles and some snazzy new visuals. It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of water being treaded. Still, they possess a few trump cards and there are a few arms aloft moments in the form of Elephant and Feels Like We Only Go Backwards. You suspect, given Parker\u2019s restless, inventive energy, that when they return here it will be in triumphant form. And hopefully they won\u2019t be facing off against Stormzy then, too. Welcome back! We\u2019ll be bringing you all the action on day two at Glastonbury, right through til midnight tonight \u2013 highlights along the way include Janet Jackson, Lewis Capaldi, Johnny Marr and Lizzo. We\u2019re still reeling from that five-star Stormzy performance last night, hailed by various random people we met last night as one of the best headliners ever. It really was sensational. On one level technically excellent, his flow utterly on point throughout, and his naive singing style appealingly immediate. But on a whole other level it was an emotional celebration of how far he has climbed, by just 25 years old, and how he has pulled a whole black British music scene up a rung or two as well. Having a Pyramid stage audience singing along to Shut Up \u2013 a freestyle recorded in a park \u2013 was brilliantly dissonant. Jeremy Corbyn was a fan too:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
