Speaking on the release of the interim report on Wednesday, Dodson repeated his comments that mining companies who continue to destroy Aboriginal heritage in the Pilbara were committing a form of \u201cincremental genocide\u201d. \u201cI still have that view, because these section 18s are still there, they\u2019re still capable of being exercised,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the companies take and the governments take stock of it, it will lead to that. \u201cBecause what you do is you destroy the evidentiary base of the traditional owners whose lands these companies are operating upon, you remove any heritage, any evidence of their occupation, any evidence of their story, song, dance or their location and say, there\u2019s nothing here, you don\u2019t belong here because it\u2019s all destroyed, and you consented to it being destroyed. I mean, how unjust is that?\u201d \u201cA country that engages and permits that by way of crown writ has got some culpability associated with it, and wanting to wipe out the heritage of First Nations peoples, that\u2019s really about destroying them as a people. That\u2019s got to be an incremental process of genocide.\u201d The interim report, titled Never Again, made seven recommendations including that the Australian government outlaw the use of gag clauses in agreements between mining companies and traditional owners. It also called for Rio to negotiate a restitution package with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP) and ensure a full reconstruction of the rock shelters and remediation of the site, at its own expense, as well as fund the creation of a keeping place for the 7,000 artefacts removed during excavations there. All mining companies have been called on to commit to a voluntary moratorium on applying for new approvals to destroy heritage until Western Australia\u2019s outdated laws are replaced by new legislation, which is slated to be introduced to parliament after the state election in March. The committee also called for a moratorium on the issuing of all approvals under section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act \u2013 unless there is clear evidence of free, prior, and informed consent from traditional owners \u2013 until the new laws are introduced. But the WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Yamatji man Ben Wyatt, said a moratorium on new section 18 applications was \u201cnot a practical solution\u201d. The PKKP peoples welcomed the preliminary findings. \u201cThe destruction of Juukan Gorge was a global disaster that hit at the hearts of the PKKP people and the greater community,\u201d said a PKKP Aboriginal Corporation spokesman, Burchell Hayes. \u201cWe have started the long road to healing and repairing our relationship with Rio Tinto, but there is still a long way to go. We remain steadfast in our conviction that a tragedy like this should never happen again; and that Rio Tinto now needs to turn its words into actions.\u201d The main report acknowledged that \u201cthe traditional owners of the Pilbara are not opposed to mining\u201d but \u201cthey do not accept, and we should not accept, that the destruction of their ancient culture and heritage is the price to pay for potentially short-term prosperity. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the report showed \u201cmultiparty support for strong reforms within the mining industry and state and federal legislation\u201d. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, and the Liberal National party MP George Christensen are among those who supported the majority report. The inquiry was chaired by the LNP MP Warren Entsch. Siewert said the McGowan government was \u201cmissing in action\u201d on the protection of Aboriginal heritage, saying: \u201cThis happened under their watch and under legislation that they well knew to be inadequate.\u201d The report said WA\u2019s Aboriginal heritage laws were \u201coutdated, unfit for purpose and in urgent need of replacement\u201d. Despite beginning a review of the laws in early 2018, the McGowan government \u201chas done little to curtail the existing regime that enables the destruction of Aboriginal sites\u201d. The report also said a lack of communication between the offices of the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, and the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, \u201cfrustrated the PKKP\u2019s efforts to protect the Juukan rock shelters from destruction and denied the PKKP the option of injunctive relief\u201d. Ben Wyatt, the WA minister, said most projects which require a section 18 approval to destroy, damage, or impact on Aboriginal heritage are \u201cuncontentious\u201d, and that he wouldn\u2019t be considering applications for section 18s \u201cwhere native title parties have not been appropriately consulted\u201d. He said the new heritage laws would \u201cput Aboriginal people at the heart of decision-making about their heritage, and I am confident that the broad consensus for these reforms will allow the best possible chance for a Bill to be supported by the 41st Parliament\u201d. James Fitzgerald from the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said if it weren\u2019t for the condemnation of shareholders \u2013 led by major investors Legal &amp; General and backed by Australian superannuation firms \u2013 Rio Tinto may not have faced sanction. \u201cRio Tinto\u2019s behaviour and culture may have remained largely without sanction but for the admirable and unprecedented intervention of the company\u2019s own shareholders, who demanded more than the token consequences first proposed by Rio Tinto\u2019s board,\u201d Fitzgerald said. In a statement, Rio reiterated its apology to the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge and said it would review the report\u2019s recommendations in the coming days. \u201cThe destruction of the Juukan rock shelters was wrong; it should not have happened and it does not reflect the values that Rio Tinto aspires to.\u201d The company\u2019s chair, Simon Thompson, said Rio had made important changes to the way it manages cultural heritage sites, including a commitment to modernise our agreements. \u201cWe recognise the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters caused significant pain to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and we are working very hard to progress a remedy with them,\u201d Thompson said.
