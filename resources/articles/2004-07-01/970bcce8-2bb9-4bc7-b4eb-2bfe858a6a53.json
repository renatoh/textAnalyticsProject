Jonny Wilkinson did well to sit this one out. When Wilko, as the internet spoof had it, taught Becks how to balloon the ball over the bar it was dire miscasting - it should have been Timbo showing Becks how to hit the net unfailingly. Injured Wilkinson may have been out of sight. But not out of mind. In the same week that I read a serious magazine interview with Beckham pondering on the ins and (literal) outs of plucking his eyebrows, I came across another grave and solemn article which marked his rugby buddy Jonny's launch of his range of facial moisturising creams. Rugger? Moisturising cream? Does it cure cauliflower ears or what? To realise that rugby is not what it was is to know that in the autumn Wilkinson will also lend his name to new hair gels and soaps in three fragrances - Bespoke \"for men about town\", Event \"for cavalry-twill rural types\", and Kit \"for the all-round locker-room jock who cares\". The hallowed and beery clubhouse culture of coarse rugby can be pronounced dodo dead with Wilkinson's admission that not a thimbleful of beer has passed his lips in more than 12 months and that his unwavering daily diet consists of three meals a day of chicken breasts washed down by a choice of some 20 sports \"supplements\". All the world is mad, sure, but the sports world is more mad than any other. Dogging the tracks of Africa's marathon men As Athens rushes at us, by coincidence yesterday was the exact centenary of the opening day of the third modern Olympiad - as a supporting attraction to the 1904 St Louis world's fair. It was the first time gold, silver and bronze medals were awarded (simultaneous flag-raising and national anthems came 20 years later in Paris). Also, the St Louis games - which ran from July 1 to November 23 and were generally an organisational shambles - marked the first participation by two African athletes. The Tswana tribesmen Len Tau and Jan Mashiani were in St Louis for the world's fair, as members of the cast in a theatrical replay of battle scenes from the recently concluded Boer War. As portent of all Africa's wonderful athletes to come, they entered the marathon. Tau finished a creditable ninth and Mashiani's 12th would have been far better, apparently, had he not at one stage been chased off the course and through a cornfield by two large dogs. An oar-inspiring sight on the Thames banks Henley is the place if you fancy waving a send-off to the Brit sportsmen or women most likely to succeed in next month's Olympic Games. There might be a more leisured and pastoral feel down by the riverside but the rowers mean business all right. I fancy it quite possible that the only Brit medals in Athens will come from the girls and boys who do it backwards. Can it really be 16 midsummers ago I first set eyes on Matthew Pinsent in a boat - choirboy colossus in an Eton eight beaten by a Hampton GS crew which included the Searle brothers, also gold medallists to be? Gloriously, Henley can still mix and match seriously professional sporting endeavour and accomplishment with the very same balmy amateur mood captured 50 years ago this week by the diarist Frances Partridge: \"A great feeling of youth, high spirits and promiscuous elan; variously elegant and dandified young men and a lot of pretty girls with peach-like complexions and ugly clothes; and races creating intermittent moments of excitement and roars of 'House! House!' like a cheerful dog barking. \"Ralph wore his Leander tie, and in the boathouse we saw an oar with his name painted on it. An afternoon of youthful glamour and gaiety.\" And some genuine medals in prospect. Reporting sleepy SW19 was a dream Forty years on . . . I first walked through the Wimbledon gates to work in 1964. Very first day, the big story concerned a well-lunched lineswoman, Dorothy Cavis-Brown, falling fast asleep during the first-round tie between South Africa's Abe Segal and the United States' Clark Graebner. A ballboy had to shake her awake, but not before ace snapper of the Express Terry Fincher had secured the dreamy pic for the world's delight. Coincidentally, 1964 was also strawberry-fields debut for the Daily Mirror's esteemed vet John Jackson. He is still on the press-bar beat and he reminded me yesterday that last night was the precise 40th anniversary of the moment when, as we downed our first well-earned Guinnesses after Thursday's close of play, in to join us came the two men's finalists for the following afternoon (Friday final then), the Aussie buddies, lean, keen \"Emmo\" Roy Emerson and eternal optimist and permanent runner-up, good Fred \"Ol' Bones\" Stolle, announcing: \"We're just off together to dinner in town, boys, but thought you might need a few quotes about tomorrow before we go.\" Mohammeds to the mountain. Imagine that happening today? Even an unseeded player's fifth-minder-cum-fourth-string-chauffeur-masseur charges for interviews now - and double if he speaks some English."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
