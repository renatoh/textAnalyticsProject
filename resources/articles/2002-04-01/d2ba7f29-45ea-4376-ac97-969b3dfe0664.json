Last night, two weeks after David Beckham introduced the broken metatarsal to a wider public, Gary Neville left the Old Trafford pitch on a stretcher and was immediately found to have suffered the same injury. A pair of best friends will now be spending the next few weeks sharing the treatment table. Should United reach the final of the European Cup, it seems certain that both of them will miss the trip to Hampden Park on May 15. And as with Beckham, such an injury to the elder Neville will have implications for England as well as for United. This dismal coincidence will certainly be concentrating Sven-Goran Eriksson's thoughts on the make-up of the right side of the team that he will send out to face Sweden on June 2. If they want to know about the experience of missing a final, they could ask a couple of their team-mates. Roy Keane's presence on the bench last night was a surprise, and his arrival on the pitch with 10 minutes to go sounded a note of warning to Bayer Leverkusen's hopes. Three years ago United took the field without him in their final against Bayern Munich, as a result of a caution administered during his heroic performance in the second leg of their semi-final against Juventus in Turin. Keane, more than anyone, will want the right result next Tuesday. Laurent Blanc, too, has missed one big occasion in his career, and it would probably take a firing squad to keep him out of another. Four years ago Slaven Bilic's despicable antics cost the great defender an appearance in a World Cup final on home turf and now, at the age of 36, he is not intending to miss any more big nights. United will need all their determination if they are to prevail in Germany next Tuesday, but the nature of Blanc's character was on view right from the start of last night's match at Old Trafford. In the third minute he put himself in the way of Michael Ballack's fierce shot, and a minute later he made an even more effective intervention to prevent Leverkusen taking an early lead. When the ball rebounded from Nicky Butt's misdirected pass, Dimitar Berbatov grabbed possession and did exactly what a lone striker is supposed to do, turning and racing straight for goal. Blanc, whose lack of speed was widely held to be one of the causes of United's early-season slump, was his direct opponent. For a second or two Berbatov seemed to be through. The young Bulgarian, Blanc's junior by 15 years, appeared to have used his leggy athleticism to get clear of the cover, with the penalty area and Fabien Barthez at his mercy. All Blanc's years of experience at the highest level were in evidence as he hung on long enough to wrap his right leg around the front of his opponent, taking the ball as cleanly as a pickpocket at a Bastille Day street party. But a textbook tackle appeared to have exacted a heavy price when Blanc struggled to his feet and clutched his left thigh, which had twisted as he slid in. United's physiotherapist was on the touchline in an instant, but although Blanc was to limp discreetly for several minutes he never once looked towards the bench for help. That was the sort of display for which Sir Alex Ferguson brought him to Old Trafford, and in the first half last night there were also several instances of an equally valuable ability to resolve messy situations in the United area by getting an accurate first-time touch to a loose ball, although he was partially culpable when Oliver Neuville took advantage of defensive untidiness to strike Leverkusen's second equaliser. On a night like this, you could only wonder how Ferguson ever contemplated retirement at the end of this season. As they always say, this was the kind of night that football people live for, and whatever happens in the next couple of weeks there will be plenty more of them in Ferguson's life. The dynasty which forms the core of the present squad is good for the three extra years to which he has committed himself, in which time the generation of Beckham, Giggs, Scholes, Butt and the Neville brothers will still generally be on the right side of 30. Not so Roy Keane, who will be 33 by the time his manager's second retirement date arrives. Next week United will once again need a full 90 minutes of maximum intensity from the great Irishman. And last night a blameless and luckless Gary Neville took over as the object of pity. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
