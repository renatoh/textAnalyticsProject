But it is the analysis of who voted where, and who they voted for, that will best illustrate the wider political health of the nation. Already, it is clear that once again the House of Commons is too white and too male and too middle class to reflect the people who voted for it. It is also becoming evident, on the basis of votes cast, how skewed the electoral system is: for the Conservatives, 2m more votes than Labour translates into 48 more Tory seats, while Labour's similar 2m vote advantage over the Lib Dems means 200 more seats. At the same time, political segregation along regional lines is once again approaching levels not seen since the 1980s. All of this will matter to a parliament that is going to deliver harsh measures over the months ahead and needs to carry the voters with it. It was, relatively, a good night for black and minority ethnic candidates: the number of African, Caribbean and Asian MPs has nearly doubled \u2013 if only from 14 to 26. Priti Patel has become the first female Asian Conservative MP and Labour's Shabana Mahmood is the first Muslim woman to be elected. But there were two prominent casualties: Shaun Bailey, the high-profile Conservative candidate for Hammersmith, failed to unseat Labour, and Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones could not take Chippenham from the Lib Dems. And while there will be a record number of women MPs in the new Commons, the total of 139 \u2013 which includes 48 Tories, almost a more significant breakthrough \u2013 is still less than a quarter of the 649 MPs elected on Thursday and only 11 more than in the last parliament. The consolidation of the Conservatives as the party of the English countryside and suburbs was reinforced, even if, seat by seat, the results that began to come through in the small hours of Friday morning were so disparate that it seemed impossible to draw any wider conclusions from them. Labour's vote is contracting into its heartlands of South Wales, Scotland and the inner cities. Yet even that is not uniform. Hard-working constituency MPs like Nick Palmer in Broxtowe went out on a smaller than average swing in the inner suburbs, but if that was merely the Tories reclaiming old territory, why did his neighbour Vernon Coaker hold on to the demographically similar seat of Gedling? The extraordinary swing against the solicitor-general Vera Baird that cost her a 12,000 majority in Redcar must be seen in the context of the closure of the Corus steelworks, but erratic swings were commonplace across the country. Maybe this is the dawn of the age of boutique politics, when what happens at national level is of declining significance at constituency level. That view is supported by what we know of the results of Thursday's local elections, where, despite the national results, the Tories have lost out to Labour. What is true of the new MPs is that they are ever more uniformly middle-class. The Sutton Trust's swift breakdown of educational background shows that more than a third went to fee-paying schools, against a national figure of 7%. Twenty Tories are Old Etonians, up from 15 in the last parliament, and 90% of all MPs are graduates. Of course, some graduates will come from working-class backgrounds (and some non-graduates, such as the new Labour member for Chesterfield, Toby Perkins, whose great-grandfather was the independent MP AP Herbert, are not). Yet there is a danger that the focus on gender balance, and the rather lesser one on improving the balance of ethnicities, has produced a House of Commons that in class terms is even less diverse than it looks. \u2022 More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
