It makes people fearful\u2019", "bodyText": "Felicity Warner wants everyone to die well. She is the woman behind Soul Midwives: non-medical companions who provide one-to-one holistic and spiritual care to people who are dying. The term \u201cmidwife\u201d is no accident. It refers to the similarities between drawing our first breath and our last. Just as there are certain stages for a woman in labour prior to giving birth, so are there certain end-of-life stages before someone eventually dies, says Warner. It\u2019s the same idea as end-of-life doulas. \u201cA soul midwife will recognise those stages and will work with them like a midwife would at birth.\u201d Soul midwives support a dying person to set out their wishes for the final days in a death plan. They listen, keep vigil, allow people to talk openly about their impending death and fears, and provide therapeutic support to help alleviate anxiety and pain. This can be through breathing techniques, massage, sound and music therapy and essential oils. As the \u201csoul\u201d in the title suggests, the role also offers a spiritual dimension linked to healing and detachment. But it\u2019s not just about helping people to die without fear, loneliness or anxiety. It\u2019s also about making people realise they are valued, says Warner. \u201cI\u2019m very keen on that because a lot of people we work with don\u2019t have anyone in their lives. Making them feel that they are special is a very big part of our role and to honour them as the people that they have been, because you can be made to feel very anonymous when you\u2019re dying, whether old or young\u201d. The daughter of the former Conservative MP David Mudd, Warner cites the \u201charrowing deaths\u201d of her grandmother \u2013 with whom she had lived after her parents divorced when she was six, who died of lung cancer when Warner was 14 \u2013 and her stepfather two years later that forced \u201can enormous amount\u201d of processing and reflection early on and led her to become a health journalist. In the 1990s, Warner found herself writing a number of features about women dying of breast cancer. Interviewees revealed their loneliness and isolation and the sense of being locked in a room with an elephant in it. \u201cThe biggest thing was the feeling that they couldn\u2019t talk to anybody honestly about the fact they knew they were going to die, because everybody kept saying \u2018we\u2019ll get you through this; you won\u2019t die\u2019.\u201d They talked and Warner listened. \u201cI think there was a healing in that they could just talk frankly about how they really felt to somebody who wasn\u2019t judgmental in any way.\u201d But Warner saw her journalistic boundaries begin to slide as she stepped in to fill unmet needs, such as giving a massage after one of the women confided that \u201cnobody touches me any more\u201d because of her cancer. When the last of six women she had interviewed died, her decision to help dying people full-time was realised. She began volunteering in her local hospice, where she noticed \u201cbig gaps\u201d in care delivery: the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, for example, that saw everyone \u201cwrapped up with crocheted blankets\u201d and \u201cgiven plastic cups to suck out of\u201d, regardless of their age or their personal needs. \u201cI sat there thinking it would be so useful if someone could join up the dots in what I was seeing with people who were dying. If there could be some kind of middle ground between the clinical care given and the sort of tender loving care that goes such a long way when you\u2019re really feeling ill, because that seemed to be very lacking or offered very willy-nilly and not always to everybody.\u201d Warner began road-testing what would become her \u201cgentle dying\u201d approach \u2013 the basis of soul midwifery. \u201cIt was realising how little things can make such a difference to people at the end of life. Even just sitting and holding their hand is massive to someone who has got no one else sitting with them, and having time to do that is a big thing.\u201d Warner outlined her philosophy in a book in 2003, then began delivering training in Dorset, where she lives. So far, more than 1,000 individuals have paid to attend her courses, including Macmillan and Marie Curie nurses, doctors, chaplains, social workers and psychotherapists working in the NHS, as well as people from South Africa, Canada, the US and Australia. Around 40% of trainees have gone on to practice. Warner runs a referral service from the Soul Midwives website. Many practitioners offer sliding scale charges, opt for a donation or charge nothing at all. \u201cNobody would ever be turned away if they could not pay,\u201d says Warner. \u201cIt is not about the money. Nobody would be excluded on financial grounds.\u201d Soul midwives can now be found in care homes, hospices, hospitals and within the home throughout the UK. They liaise with GPs and district nurses if someone wants to die at home. Warner admits that it\u2019s taken time to build trust with other care professionals, but adds, \u201cthis trust has grown as the value of our work is being understood and seen.\u201d For her, soul midwifery is a movement that can fill the gap once met through closer community networks and she views dying as a process rather than an event \u2013 something that she feels has been lost over the generations. Recently Warner has introduced the idea of soul midwife \u201cresidencies\u201d so that end-of-life discussions leave the confines of hospitals and hospices. \u201cWe need to bring the care of the dying back into the community. It\u2019s been so medicalised and taken out of most people\u2019s normal environment, and that makes it very fearful [for people].\u201d She cites a recent example of a soul midwife pitching up at a library for a morning so that people could come and discuss various aspects of dying. She now hopes to persuade a coffee shop chain to host residencies. What is clear is that ensuring a tranquil, gentle death for others is also good for Warner\u2019s own soul. She says: \u201cI feel it\u2019s my reason for being here.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 60. Family: Married, two daughters. Lives: Chideock, Dorset.
