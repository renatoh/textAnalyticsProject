According to the German magazine Der Spiegel, two of the Nike Oregon Project\u2019s elite athletes and Farah\u2019s training partners, the Olympic marathon bronze medallist Galen Rupp and the Olympic 1500m champion Matthew Centrowitz, also submitted \u201csamples that arose suspicion in the doping investigators\u201d. The latest allegations, based on a leaked Usada report from March 2016, plus hundreds of emails, PDF files and Word documents obtained by the magazine from the Fancy Bears hacker group, have been strongly denied by Nike and the athletes involved. According to the Usada report, Salazar has an \u201cobsession with the testosterone levels of his athletes\u201d. However Usada hit a brick wall when it asked the legendary endurance coach for all his notes, documents and emails containing the words \u201ctestosterone\u201d, \u201cTestoboost\u201d or \u201cTesto\u201d. He apparently refused, saying they were on the Nike server and belonged to the company. Der Spiegel reports that Nike, when approached by Usada, said that although it was not averse to cooperating it wanted to sign a \u201cconfidentiality agreement\u201d which Usada reportedly considered so restrictive that its lawyer William Bock accused it of making \u201cunreasonable demands\u201d. After weeks of negotiations Bock reportedly wrote to Nike on 21 January 2016 to say: \u201cIf accepted, your amendments would give to Nike: 1) Unilateral control over Usada\u2019s use of documents already in Usada\u2019s possession. 2) The ability to prevent Usada from using documents in a hearing. And 3) The potential capacity to interfere with, delay or impede Usada\u2019s investigation in a myriad of ways.\u201d Nike rejected the criticism and has pointed out the company had sent thousands of pages of documents to Usada. A Nike spokesman told the Guardian the company had done so \u201ceven though Usada has no legal right to request or access the documents and has never informed Nike of the precise nature of its investigation. Nike undertook this effort because it strongly believes in clean sport and does not tolerate the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\u201d The spokesman said Nike \u201chas not tried to obstruct\u201d Usada and added: \u201cNike requested confidentiality because Usada\u2019s requests were so broad and expansive that responding to them would include producing documents that contained sensitive, irrelevant and sometimes very personal information about Oregon Project athletes and others unrelated to Usada\u2019s purported investigation.\u201d Two of the Nike Oregon Project\u2019s most famous athletes are also referred to in the Usada report, according to the magazine. It claims that on 14 January 2016 Usada\u2019s science director, Matthew Fedoruk, received an email from his test results division. In it, a Usada employee reportedly noted of a test on Rupp that \u201cT/E is elevated compared to athlete\u2019s previous pattern in samples\u201d. The relationship between testosterone and epitestosterone is around 1:1 and when elevated it can be an indicator of possible doping. According to Der Spiegel, Fedoruk ordered further tests, but the outcome of those tests is not known. Rupp, who was tested 14 times last year, denies ever taking testosterone. Meanwhile, before the Rio Olympics, Usada employees sent internal emails about the hemoglobin value and reticulocyte count in a sample provided by Centrowitz, who was tested 17 times last year. According to Der Spiegel, in one email a Usada scientist wrote that the sample exhibited a \u201csuspicious profile\u201d and the investigators agreed to test him again \u201cin the next week or two.\u201d However the emails do not provide any indication of whether that happened, while Centrowitz told Der Spiegel that he was never contacted by Usada and \u201cis dedicated to a clean sport\u201d. According to Der Spiegel, Usada\u2019s report also says that Salazar banned his athletes from speaking about the vitamins and medications they take, even among themselves \u2013 but used high levels of vitamin D to try to increase the production of hormones \u2013 with doses of 50,000 international units well above the recommended dose of 600 international units. Salazar has consistently strongly denied committing any anti-doping violations and insists that he has always complied with the anti-doping code. In a statement last week he said: \u201cI believe in a clean sport and a methodical, dedicated approach to training. The Oregon Project will never permit doping and all Oregon Project athletes are required to comply with the Wada Code and IAAF Rules. I do not use supplements that are banned.\u201d There is no suggestion Farah has done anything wrong and on Saturday he told the Observer that he was more than happy for his blood samples to be retested after claims that Usada wanted them checked for the banned blood-boosting drug EPO.\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any request,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as I\u2019ve said many times, I\u2019m happy to be tested any time, anywhere and have any of my samples tested or retested now or at any time in the future, by any official body.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
