We weren't told what adjustments had been made to the famously adaptable Symphony Hall acoustic before its 10th birthday gala concert on Tuesday, but they obviously worked. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment sounded remarkably fresh, rich and powerful. Simon Rattle, returning to the hall he helped bring into existence, energised the players impressively, and shaped each performance with elaborate care. His performances of Mozart's Symphonies 39 and 40 were always interesting, and at times captivating - as in the airborne, quick-waltzing first and third movements of Symphony No 39. But for all the polish and intelligence, there was something disengaged about the 40th symphony. It wasn't until soprano Cecilia Bartoli took the stage in Haydn's Scena di Berenice that the music-making came fully to life. Haydn's startlingly dramatic music and Bartoli's superb singing seemed to find extra resources in the players. But they'd have to be a pretty stolid lot not to be caught up by Bartoli's performance. She may not have a particularly powerful voice, but she more than compensated with her intense expression, thrilling agility and exceptional musicianship. As pure spectacle, her performance was extraordinary enough: in no time at all she had become Berenice and it was easy to believe this was a woman going mad with grief. Bartoli showed similar qualities in Fiordiligi's recitative and aria Per Pieta from the second act of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte. Again, this is emotionally high-voltage stuff - one of those moments when Mozart's music reveals more humanity than Lorenzo da Ponte's fatuously misogynistic libretto deserves. For Bartoli, there was nothing comic about Fiordiligi's agonising. And impressive as she was technically, it was the dramatic truth that stood to the fore. It was a pity she couldn't have followed it with something equally striking; but the aria Un Moto di Gioia, which Mozart nearly included in The Marriage of Figaro, is pure froth, while Parto, Parto from La Clemenza di Tito is a brilliant double concerto for voice and clarinet rather than a wonderful operatic character study. Bartoli sang Parto, Parto as well as one would have expected. But it was her encore - Cherubino's Voi, Che Sapete from Figaro - that revealed once more the dramatic penetration and outstanding musicality that make her the great performer she is."}, "isHosted": false}}}
