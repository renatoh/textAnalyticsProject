Victories at Salford are certainly not the formality they used to be. In the space of eight months, the Red Devils have become one of the league\u2019s most impressive sides, and they sit second in the table on merit as the season passes the halfway stage. But, for a Hull side without four members of last season\u2019s Super League Dream Team and their star half-back Marc Sneyd, this was an ideal way to prepare for next weekend\u2019s eagerly-awaited Challenge Cup quarter-final with the leaders, Castleford. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight as hard as we did last year in winning it to just give it away,\u201d said the Hull coach Radford, whose side moved back into the top four following this encouraging victory. It would be foolish though to suggest Salford, one of the league\u2019s real surprise packages this season, are on the slide following back-to-back defeats for the first time in 2017. They too have a cup quarter-final next weekend \u2013 but Ian Watson\u2019s side looked noticeably tired here. Watson has been fortunate in that he has not had a plethora of injuries to contend with this term, but the effects of two double-header weekends in six weeks perhaps took their toll. \u201cThey taught us a bit of a lesson,\u201d he lamented afterwards. The damage was done by the visitors in the first half. They led 22-0 by the interval thanks to tries from Fetuli Talanoa, Danny Washbrook and two for the half-back Albert Kelly. The Australian\u2019s arrival from cross-city rivals Hull KR sparked some debate at the end of last season, but with 17 tries in 16 games so far in a Hull shirt, he has proven an inspired signing. \u201cHe\u2019s a gambler but he\u2019s talented,\u201d Radford said of Kelly. Hull were able to rest him in the final quarter, and while Salford were much improved after the break, tries from Niall Evalds and Weller Hauraki were mere consolation, especially with the visitors responding via Carlos Tuimavave and Jamie Shaul to round off a performance that puts them in good shape for next weekend\u2019s tie with the league leaders.
