In the table, published by Times Higher Education (THE) magazine, Oxford is the UK's top-ranked institution in fourth place, up two positions from last year. Cambridge is second highest, in sixth. The arch-rivals tied in sixth place last year. Harvard was denied the top spot for the first time since the table began eight years ago. Instead, Caltech \u2013 the California Institute for Technology \u2013 topped the table. Seven UK universities are in the top 50, two more than last year. But while last year, 14 UK universities made the top 100, this year only a dozen have. THE said this showed \"a widening gap in the UK between a super-elite and the rest of Britain's leading institutions\". The UK has 32 institutions in the top 200 \u2013 the second highest of any country and three more than last year. but the US dominates, with 75 in the top 200. THE warned the UK might be unable to maintain its international reputation for universities unless state funding grew. Figures last month from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show spending on higher education in the UK fell to 1.2% from 1.3% last year. The average for OECD countries is 1.5%. Ann Mroz, THE editor, said: \"Given the disparity in funding levels [between the UK and the US] our performance is nothing short of staggering. Put simply, we spend much less on our universities than many of our competitors \u2013 less than the OECD average \u2013 and yet outperform almost all of them. These facts make the massive gamble that we are now taking, by all but abolishing public funding for university teaching and replacing it with tuition fees, all the more questionable.\" Sally Hunt, general secretary of the lecturers' trade union, the University and College Union, warned that unless ministers urgently rethought plans to slash funding, the UK would be left behind. \"Other countries recognise that knowledge is the main driver of economic growth and are investing in their universities,\" she said. David Willetts, the universities minister, said the UK had \"the world's best-performing higher education sector\" relative to its size and smaller per capita resources. Outside the US and UK, the Netherlands and Germany have the most top 200 universities with 12 each, followed by Canada with nine and Australia with seven. Of other UK universities, Imperial College London came eighth, up one from last year, while University College London came in at 17th position \u2013 up five places. Edinburgh took 36th place. The LSE and the University of Manchester came 47th and 48th, respectively. Those compiling the tables judged universities on, among other things, their research income and reputation; the number of international students, staff and overseas collaborations; links with industry; the number of their citations; and the quality of their teaching. This year, the methodology to rank the universities changed to put institutions with particular strength in the arts, humanities and social sciences on a more equal footing.Thomson Reuters supplied the data for the table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
