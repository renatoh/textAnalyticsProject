After the chilling conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this year, the latest scientific evidence shows that global warming is accelerating even faster than their worst-case scenarios. For the government to follow this by not only backing down from its own unambitious programmes to increase renewable energy from the current 2%, but to also seek to undermine the efforts of other European countries to set a modest 20% renewable energy target by 2020, would confirm the worst fears of all those who predicted that a preoccupation with nuclear power would crowd out better options for cutting emissions. I hope the prime minister will take the opportunity of this leaked paper to stamp down on those unable to see the growing threat of climate change, and instead map out a coherent programme for Britain to take advantage of our almost unparalleled renewable energy opportunities - from wind, wave, and tidal as well as solar power, so the government's actions start to match its rhetoric. Ken Livingstone Mayor of London The government is being disingenuous when it claims the renewable energy target agreed by Tony Blair will undermine the European emissions trading scheme. This will only happen if the caps on carbon emissions already agreed are not adjusted to take a more rapid renewables' expansion into account. While the target will be difficult to achieve, the government should be making more effort to remove barriers to renewable electricity. Perhaps more importantly, it needs to make up for the lack of incentives for renewable heat. Future caps on carbon emissions should also be tightened so carbon prices do not continue at their present low levels.
