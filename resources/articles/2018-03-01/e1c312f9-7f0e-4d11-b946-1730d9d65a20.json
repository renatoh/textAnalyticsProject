But in findings that underline the divisions over the issue, the poll showed that seven in 10 respondents said they had seen the students on television, and six in 10 thought they were \u201ceffective advocates for gun control\u201d. After they survived a shooting at their high school on 14 February, in which 17 people were killed, many teenagers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland spoke in favor of stricter gun control laws and began to organize a march on Washington to demand action from Congress. Some who gave particularly passionate public speeches, including Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, have become nationally recognized advocates, with hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter. A majority of respondents in the Monmouth University poll of 800 American adults said they believed the Parkland students were having more impact on the gun debate than victims of previous mass shootings. But nearly a quarter of respondents said they believed this activism was \u201cbeing manipulated by outside groups\u201d. The feeling was strongest among self-identified members of the NRA, 61% of whom said they believed the students were being manipulated. Forty-seven percent of respondents, by contrast, said the students were \u201cadvocating for issues they really believe in\u201d. Another 27% said the students\u2019 activism was shaped by both their own beliefs and outside manipulation. Five percent didn\u2019t know. The Parkland students\u2019 activism is, however, reaching the broader public \u2013 and many Americans are convinced they are making a difference. The students have used interviews and their own social media platforms to attack the NRA, make arguments for gun control and respond to critics who argue that their advocacy is inappropriate. Their responses \u2013 raw, angry, sarcastic and filled with impatience towards adults \u2013 are a striking new note in gun politics. Advocates who have often spoken on behalf of children now find children leading the way. Nearly two-thirds of adults surveyed said they approved of how the students were handling themselves in the media. Among self-identified gun owners, 53% said they approved. Even self-identified NRA members were not entirely negative, with only 50% saying they disapproved of how the students were handling themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
