The 27-year-old, one of the favourites to win gold in Sunday\u2019s road race, had \u201cwhereabouts\u201d failures in August and October 2015, plus June of this year, but a legal team, funded by British Cycling, had the first test struck off the record by arguing a testing official was at fault. \u201cThe ruling relates to a Ukad anti-doping test which was asserted to have been attempted on Thursday 20 August, 2015, whilst Armitstead was staying at the team hotel, during the UCI Women\u2019s Road World Cup in Sweden,\u201d a statement released on behalf of the cyclist said. It is understood the official was refused Armitstead\u2019s room number at the hotel\u2019s reception and attempted to call the world champion but her phone was silent as she was sleeping. That was sufficient evidence for Cas, who \u201cpromptly and unanimously cleared Armitstead of the asserted missed test\u201d. \u201cI have always been and will always be a clean athlete and have been vocal in my anti-doping stance throughout my career,\u201d said Armitstead, who was Britain\u2019s first medallist of London 2012 with silver in the road race. \u201cI am pleased Cas has accepted my position, having provided detailed information demonstrating the situation around my strikes. \u201cThis issue was one of administration and was the result of Ukad not following proper procedure nor fully attempting to make contact with me despite clear details being provided under \u2018whereabouts\u2019. I was tested in competition the day after this test, reinforcing my position that I do not cheat and had no intention of not being tested. \u201cI think that there should be clearer guidelines for those administrating tests and would like to work with UKAD going forward to explore how this can be better addressed in the future so no other athlete is put in this position.\u201d A British Cycling spokesman said: \u201cBritish Cycling can confirm that following her appeal to the court of arbitration for sport, Lizzie Armitstead remains a part of the Team GB squad for the Rio Games. We are satisfied that the matter has now been resolved and look forward to Rio, where we have full confidence that the team will be a great success.\u201d The other two failures remain on the cyclist\u2019s record. If an athlete fails three in the space of 12 months they face up to a four-year suspension. Christine Ohuruogu, the 400m runner, served a year-long ban a decade ago after missing three tests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
