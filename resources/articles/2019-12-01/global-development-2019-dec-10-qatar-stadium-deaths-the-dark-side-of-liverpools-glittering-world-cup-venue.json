When they take their seats at the Khalifa International Stadium, where Liverpool will play their semi-final match, they may not realise that scores of workers who refurbished the stadium were housed in filthy, overcrowded accommodation with an ever-present stench of raw sewage. There will be no announcements to inform them that these men were paid less than promised, their passports were confiscated and they were unable to change jobs or quit the country, leaving some vulnerable to forced labour, a modern form of slavery, according to Amnesty International. And looking up at the soaring stadium arches, there will be nothing to remind them that British construction worker Zac Cox fell to his death here in 2017. Fifa announced on Saturday that the original venue for the game on 18 December, the dazzling new Education City Stadium, was not match ready. But the Education City stadium also has a story of death and indifference at the highest levels of the game. In June, a 24-year-old labourer from Nepal, Rupchandra Rumba, died gasping for breath in a squalid labour camp on the outskirts of Doha. He was working as a scaffolder at Education City Stadium. Nearly six months after he died, and more than two months since the Guardian first revealed her plight, Rumba\u2019s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, has still not received any compensation from Qatar. Sitting in her small room on the edge of Kathmandu, with photos of her husband on the walls, Pakrin says their six-year-old son, Niraj, is struggling to accept that his father is not coming home. \u201cHe keeps asking: \u2018Where\u2019s my dad? Why is he not calling? When will he come?\u2019\u201d she says. In recent weeks, Pakrin says the director of the company that employed Rumba has been pressuring her to accept a pay-off of 7,000 Qatari rials (\u00a31,460). She says she feels afraid. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about my safety. He is using threatening language,\u201d she says. Her brother, Pradip Pakrin, has dismissed the offer, saying: \u201cWe have to fight for what is right. If we accept this, other families will suffer.\u201d Nick McGeehan, a director of Fair/Square Projects and an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf, says: \u201cWe appear to have this appalling situation where the families of workers who have died get derisory pay-offs or nothing at all from Qatar.\u201d McGeehan says the supreme committee, the body organising the Club World Cup, which starts on Wednesday, must take responsibility for the unexplained deaths of young men building its stadiums and compensate their families. Liverpool\u2019s CEO, Peter Moore, backed McGeehan in a letter on Tuesday, saying: \u201cWe support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve.\u201d Rumba\u2019s case is not a one-off. A total of 11 stadium workers died in 2018, according to the supreme committee. Of these deaths, 10 were described as \u201cnon-work related\u201d, mostly attributed to sudden and unexplained heart or respiratory failure. Data on the number of deaths of stadium workers in 2019 has not yet been published. In the past year the Guardian has spoken to the families of five deceased stadium workers, including Rumba. Two say they have not received any compensation from Qatar. The other three only received compensation after the Guardian revealed their stories last year. \u201cPoor people like us cannot hope to get compensation,\u201d says Johurul Islam, whose brother-in-law, Monjurul Islam, 28, a stadium worker from Bangladesh, died in August 2018. \u201cThe Qatar government does not see us as human.\u201d A spokesperson for the supreme committee said in a statement that in most cases compensation is only paid when a worker dies in a work-related accident. For non-work-related deaths, \u201cthe supreme committee ensures our contractors pay final salaries [and] end of service benefits.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s findings will heap pressure on Liverpool, whose participation in the tournament has come under scrutiny from fans and human rights groups. Minky Worden, a director at Human Rights Watch, believes Liverpool\u2019s players and management should raise these abuses and demand reforms. \u201cLiverpool and other teams who play in Qatar should be aware that migrant workers have died to deliver the stadiums they are playing in, and at every opportunity speak up to insist that they are protected,\u201d she says. Last month, in an interview for the club\u2019s television channel, Moore said the club had \u201cgone to great lengths\u201d to understand the issues in Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019re not a political organisation and it\u2019s neither our place nor our ambition to go from country to country forcing our values and our beliefs on others,\u201d he added. That may come as bad news to the family of Monjurul Islam. Johurul Islam says his brother-in-law paid a recruitment agent almost 500,000 Bangladeshi taka (\u00a34,470) to secure his job in Qatar, a fee he could only afford by selling his land and taking out loans. The agent promised him a lucrative salary, but his basic wage turned out to be just 600 Qatari rials a month (\u00a3125), says Johurul, far below the minimum wage, which itself is widely viewed as inadequate. Johurul claims Monjurul\u2019s direct employer, one of Qatar\u2019s largest construction companies, did not provide any compensation. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even pay all the salary and allowances they owed him.\u201d Johurul has been left devastated and confused by his death. \u201cI was very close to him. He had no illness. His death certificate said he died of a heart attack, but I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says. He has good reason to be suspicious. In October the Guardian revealed that in the vast majority of cases the Qatari authorities do not carry out postmortem examinations, making it impossible to accurately determine the cause of death. Death certificates routinely state that workers die of respiratory or cardiac failure \u201cdue to natural causes\u201d, but such explanations are meaningless, according to a British forensic pathologist, Stuart Hamilton. \u201cAll they say is someone died because they are dead. If a trainee pathologist presented me with these conclusions, I would tell them to go away and do some more work,\u201d says Hamilton. The Guardian has found that many deaths of migrant workers in Qatar are likely to be linked to the extreme summer heat, which sees workers toiling in temperatures that regularly reach 45C. The number of World Cup 2022 stadium workers who die each year are just a fraction of the total number of migrant worker deaths. Less than 2% of Qatar\u2019s migrant workforce are employed at World Cup stadiums, but tens of thousands are working on infrastructure to support the World Cup in 2022, including hotel, rail and road construction. Government data from India, Nepal and Bangladesh reveal the true scale of the death toll in Qatar. At least 1,025 workers from Nepal died between 2012 and 2017, 676 of them from causes deemed to be \u201cnatural\u201d. In 2018, 149 Bangladeshi workers died, with 107 deaths classified as \u201cnatural\u201d. Between 2012 and August 2018, 1,678 Indian workers died. Of these deaths, 1,345 were described as \u201cnatural\u201d \u2013 a rate of four a week. A spokesperson for the supreme committee said the health and safety of all its workers was of the \u201cutmost importance\u201d. The supreme committee \u201cinvestigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities \u2026 to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident \u2026 the responsibility to investigate the underlying causes of non-work related death lies with the relevant local authorities.\u201d In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson said Fifa, along with its local partners, is \u201cfully committed to safeguarding the rights of workers\u201d contributing to the Club World Cup and the 2022 World Cup. The spokesperson added that \u201csignificant measures have been put in place at World Cup construction sites focusing on health and safety and workers\u2019 protection\u201d.
