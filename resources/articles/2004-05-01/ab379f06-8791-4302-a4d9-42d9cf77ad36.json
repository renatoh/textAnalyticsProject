I know from my own experiences in FA Cup finals how vital it is to get that side of things right. I was a hugely experienced 28-year-old when I played my first FA Cup final for Everton against Watford but for 20 minutes my mouth was bone dry. I had played in a League Cup final when I was younger but this was different. It was the FA Cup and I thought it might be my first and last chance. That got to me for a bit and it's something Millwall will have to deal with. Most of their players realise this will be their only crack at a Cup final. They know it's all or nothing and that will make them more nervous than ever. The big question is whether they freeze. We don't know what those boys will be like when they walk out in front of 70,000 at Cardiff. The answer to that will be important but dealing with things mentally has another side. No one expects Millwall to win but they mustn't feel just happy to be there and happy to be in Europe next season or they'll be beaten. Millwall's situation is a bit like Watford's against Everton in 1984 and I think Watford's downfall was their sense of delight just to be there. In the week beforehand most of the stories were from their chairman Elton John and manager Graham Taylor saying they were delighted to be going to Wembley, what a great achievement it was and they were going to enjoy the day. We were totally different. We were going to enjoy the day only if we won. Graham did not have the experience of Cup finals at that time but Millwall's management team of Dennis Wise and Ray Wilkins do in abundance. I'm sure they'll be doing everything to make sure the players are physically and mentally ready. If I was in their shoes I know what my last words would be before the team went out. \"This is one opportunity for each and every one of you to put yourselves down in football history,\" I'd say. \"Do you want a bit of it?\" Being part of the Wolves team that beat Nottingham Forest in the 1980 League Cup final made me well aware that shocks can happen. Although we were both in the top division, Forest were en route to becoming European champions again and looking to win a third League Cup in a row. We had a lot of players at the top end of their careers and went in as complete underdogs. Millwall have to use their underdog status to their advantage. There is huge pressure on United because this is their last chance of silverware and everyone expects them to win. They have very experienced players but a lot haven't played in an FA Cup final. Tim Howard, Wes Brown, Mikael Silvestre, John O'Shea, Cristiano Ronaldo and Ruud van Nistelrooy fall into that category. The way Millwall set out their stall will be important. I think they need to make themselves difficult to play against. Going foward they look good but defensively they sometimes fly by the seat of their pants a bit and they need to be solid. They mustn't get stretched because United will pick holes in them, so when they lose possession they need to drop back, make it difficult for United to pass in midfield and try to leave the ball with United's back four. The hope would be that United are forced to hit things long. That would suit Millwall because their centre-backs, Darren Ward and Matt Lawrence, are strong in the air. What they can't afford to do is give United time and space in midfield, so it will be a big bonus for them if Wise is fit. I'm not a fan of breaking up play with fouls but I would understand if Millwall set out to do that to prevent United building up a rhythm. It will be hard for Millwall if they lose the midfield battle and their wide midfielders have a responsibility. They've got to protect their full-backs because Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo are capable of destroying anybody in a one against one. Although Millwall must not be over-adventurous, they need to be ready to strike when they get the chance. United haven't been watertight and Millwall have players who can cause problems in Paul Ifill, Tim Cahill, Neil Harris and Wise. Where I think United are a little weak is in wide areas, where O'Shea and Gary Neville can be got at. If Millwall can break quickly and get at the full-backs, they might be able to exploit that. I can see Millwall scoring but what I don't know is whether they can keep United out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
