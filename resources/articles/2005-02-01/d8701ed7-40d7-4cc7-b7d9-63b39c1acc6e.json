He and his 'coat so grey' have been a blue touchpaper issue for centuries. Today Mr Peel would risk arrest (not least for breaching the peace with those horns and hounds awakening the dead). Yet hunters and their opponents have long done us great service with their emblematic confrontations defusing deeper rifts: toffs versus oiks, country v town, Whigs v Tories, EastEnders v Emmerdale. Will class and culture wars now have to be fought out for real? Since Friday it has been illegal to hunt mammals with dogs. Or rather to hunt mammals other than rats or rabbits with dogs. Or rather to hunt mammals other than rats or rabbits with more than two dogs. Or rather to allow more than two dogs to tear into a mammal... unless said mammal has first been shot. We admit to delight that the law is clearly unenforceable and that hunting has so far proceeded undisturbed. If parliament intended to protect animals, it fell at the first fence. Even John Peel's eulogist had more respect for the fox: Do ye ken that a fox with his last breath Cursed them all as he died in the morning?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
