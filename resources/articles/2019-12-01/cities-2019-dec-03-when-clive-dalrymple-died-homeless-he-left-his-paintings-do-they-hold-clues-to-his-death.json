Do they hold clues to his death?", "bodyText": "When Clive Dalrymple sold his painting of a vivid blue seascape to Katy Cavanagh, he signed the back of the canvas: \u201cManchester homeless, 12/12/2016.\u201d Clive had been living on the streets of Chinatown, Manchester, and he could often be found perched in front of an easel painting pictures. Cavanagh lived round the corner, and the seascape caught her eye. \u201cIt was so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe came across as quite positive, and was trying to make an honest living rather than just asking for money.\u201d Clive died on 13 August this year. His death was reported in the Manchester Evening News, but there were only scant details about his life \u2013 that he was 52, had just left Manchester Royal Infirmary after an operation, had a room in supported accommodation and was known to outreach charities working in the city centre. No next of kin had been located Homelessness has consumed Manchester since the coalition government introduced its austerity policy after 2010. Rough sleeping is visible everywhere in the city. You can see it in almost every doorway, bus shelter and subway. It\u2019s at the centre of the city\u2019s politics, leads the front pages of the local papers and everyone from shop workers to volunteers at the cathedral have an opinion about it. Mostly that it\u2019s getting worse. A record number of homeless people died in 2018, the biggest increase in deaths since reporting began. In total, 726 homeless people died in the UK. There were 19 deaths in Manchester, making it the local authority with the third highest number of deaths behind Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne. Ameera Ramzan, the co-founder of Feeding Manchester\u2019s Forgotten Homeless, has worked with the city\u2019s rough sleepers for more than a decade, and supported Clive for two years before he died. She brought him clothes, fed him and helped him with his artwork by supplying canvases as well as paints and an easel. She came to think of him as a brother. \u201cClive was one in a million,\u201d she says. \u201cWe looked forward to going out every night and feeding Clive. His manners were beautiful. He would let no one disrespect you.\u201d Front and back views of a painting by Clive Dalrymple purchased by Katy Cavanagh. Photograph: @KatyCavaz Clive told people he could not \u201cdo four walls\u201d, and spent much of his life on the streets. Ramzan believes his paintings provided an escape. \u201cIt was like a fantasy world in his head. He loved to jump into the picture \u2013 that was his paradise.\u201d His paintings attracted many admirers, including art students who would seek him out for painting lessons at his spot in Chinatown. \u201cThey would sit and drink with Clive, and learn from him,\u201d Ramzan says. After Clive\u2019s death, Ramzan read that none of his family could be reached, and was concerned that he would be given a \u201cpauper\u2019s burial\u201d by the council. \u201cI thought: \u2018No, no, no, his story is not going to end like this,\u2019\u201d she says. She tracked down his relatives on social media. After helping to arrange his funeral, she drove to Liverpool with Clive\u2019s coffin to meet his brother Ray and the rest of his family, who had come from all over the UK and from as far as Memphis in the US. In a pub next to Lime Street station in central Liverpool, Ray Dalrymple arrives dressed in a homemade cycling T-shirt and flat cap. He is a fit man who cycles 28 miles every day, and speaks softly in a broad Liverpudlian accent. Ray is black; Clive was mixed race. They have different mothers, but shared the same Trinidadian father with 12 other siblings. \u201cWe all look out for each other,\u201d Ray says. Ray and Clive were born in Liverpool, but they didn\u2019t meet until they were adults. Clive grew up in Glasgow with his mother and stepfather, while Ray was raised in the Toxteth area of Liverpool by his mother. Ray saw Clive on TV before he met him in person. \u201cI was at my dad\u2019s one time, and he turned round and went: \u2018Look, there\u2019s Clive on the news running around naked,\u2019\u201d Ray recalls. Clive had run away from home aged 13 to join a group of new age travellers who were involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Ray thinks the news report was broadcast from Greenham Common, where the women\u2019s peace camp was protesting against nuclear weapons being stored at the RAF base. He later learned that Clive had stripped naked in the hope of luring TV cameras to where soldiers were changing into police uniforms. He didn\u2019t succeed. Ray first met Clive in the mid-1980s, during a trip to Glasgow to see his half-sister Aloma Owens. \u201cI went to this bar and I\u2019m watching this fella dancing, and I was like: \u2018God, he doesn\u2019t half dance like me,\u2019 and then he walked away, and I was like: \u2018Fucking hell, he\u2019s got my walk as well.\u2019\u201d Ray was at the bar when he felt a hand on his shoulder. \u201c\u2018Is your name Ray?\u2019\u201d the stranger asked. \u201cI said: \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he went: \u2018I\u2019m your brother Clive.\u2019\u201d Ray was 25 at the time; Clive was 19 and was visiting his mother and stepfather. Ray says Clive appeared healthy, his accent was a Bristol-Glasgow hybrid, and he was friendly, but reserved. They made small talk, mostly about the madness of meeting up after all this time. They didn\u2019t see each other again until Ray received a call from his father a few years later informing him that Clive was being prosecuted in London for \u201cstealing water\u201d. Ray, who was working as a security guard in London at the time, turned up at court just as his brother was addressing the judge. \u201cApparently he broke into a derelict house, and the police came in while he was having a bath,\u201d Ray says. Clive was using more than one surname at the time, which confused things at the court. Ray creases up as he recalls his brother explaining to the judge that he had many aliases because he was a street dancer. If there was one thing Clive Dalrymple could not make a living from, he thought, it was dancing. The judge asked the court if Clive could be bailed anywhere. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, your honour. I\u2019m his brother,\u201d Ray announced. Clive looked up at the public gallery, saw Ray, and clasped his hands together in gratitude. Ray apologises, and says he\u2019s not good with dates, but he thinks this was 1989. He arranged for Clive to stay at their father\u2019s house in Liverpool, but Clive was kicked out after the two clashed. His life spiralled downwards from there. By the mid-1990s, he was in prison for what Ray believes was a drug-related crime. When Clive got out of jail, he was released back to his father\u2019s house. Ray shows us a picture of Clive from this period. He looks beefy after pumping iron throughout his prison sentence. The brothers would go on nights out in Liverpool, and Clive turned out to be popular with women. \u201cHe could talk the birds out of the trees,\u201d Ray says. \u201cWhen he cleaned up, everyone was coming up to me going: \u2018Isn\u2019t your brother dead charming?\u2019 His chat-up lines were terrible, but he just had the gift of the gab.\u201d Such as? \u201cHow\u2019s your bum for cracking nuts?\u201d Ray laughs. Ray Dalrymple, Clive\u2019s half-brother. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian There was still much that was mysterious about his brother\u2019s life. But he did know that Clive had two children. Ray says Clive didn\u2019t have much contact with either of them, but both are now happy adults. Ray didn\u2019t see Clive for prolonged periods while the two were in Liverpool. On one of the last occasions, they bumped into each other by chance outside a nightclub. Ray\u2019s attention was drawn to the pavement when an irritable club bouncer barked: \u201cMove away you dirty smackhead!\u201d to an emaciated man on the ground. \u201cI looked down and went: \u2018Clive!\u2019 The last time I had seen him he was really muscular because any time he went to prison he wouldn\u2019t use [drugs], he\u2019d just work out. But he looked like death. He was trying to hide his face \u2013 he\u2019d lost his teeth. I asked him: \u2018Clive, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 He said: \u2018Ray, I feel ashamed.\u2019\u201d * * * A couple of Clive\u2019s homeless friends travelled with Ameera Ramzan from Manchester to Liverpool for his funeral. They told Ray about his brother\u2019s kindness \u2013 the time he opened up his tent to other rough sleepers in Manchester city centre during a heavy downpour. But they also told him how tough it has become for struggling people to survive in Manchester. The Labour party has linked the high level of homeless deaths to local government spending cuts, which in Manchester have amounted to a reduction of \u00a3926 for each household \u2013 three times the national average. The government\u2019s 2018 single-night rough sleeping snapshot recorded a 31% rise in the number of rough sleepers in the city compared with 2017. In 2010, there were seven rough sleepers counted; in 2018, 123 were counted. It seems that everyone involved with homelessness in the city knows somebody who has died on the streets. Under Manchester Arndale\u2019s food court, a group of rough sleepers and beggars are sipping lager and cider, and smoking roll-ups while chatting loudly among themselves. Each person in the group points in a different direction to a doorway where someone has died. The loss of loved ones has led to the founding of a number of homeless charities and grassroots initiatives in Manchester. Coffee4Craig, a local outreach charity, began handing out coffee in the city after Risha Lancaster lost her brother to a heroin overdose in a Cardiff car park. Now the charity operates a drop-in centre offering showers, hot meals and access to computers. Hendrix Lancaster, Risha\u2019s husband, and a co-founder of the charity, tells us he came into contact with Clive on several occasions. \u201cI did see his artwork when I was walking up Portland Street,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was a fantastic artist.\u201d He thinks Clive was offered accommodation on three occasions, but understands that he turned them all down. Clive had been living on the street for almost all his life, and Lancaster believes he was one of those people who couldn\u2019t see a way back. \u201cThey become so caught up in that lifestyle that they become phobic about going back into the world of responsibilities, bills and four walls.\u201d Another local homelessness charity, the Wellspring, has lost so many of its service users that it has created a memorial at the entrance to its drop-in centre in Stockport. Its chief executive, Jonathan Billings, gives us a potted history of many of the 40 or so people commemorated on the wall. There\u2019s Richard the guitar player who died of hypothermia a couple of years ago in a bush outside his hostel. Daniel, another young face on the wall, died when he was 22. He was a talented footballer who won a place at Manchester City\u2019s academy, but struggled with alcoholism. Billings is 1.95 metres (6ft 5in) tall and an ex-Grenadier guardsman. He has been working for the charity, which initially operated out of a nearby scout hut, for 17 years. \u201cFor a year, it was a war zone,\u201d he says. Billings thinks his size earned him the job before he even sat down at his interview. Back then, stolen goods were being sold, drugs were being dealt and assaults occurred every day. \u201cI phoned the police three or four times a day for about a year.\u201d The charity has changed a lot since then. The Wellspring claims to have helped more than 1,500 homeless people into accommodation, and offers a range of activities and educational classes to members of the local community. The Wellspring is part of the mayor\u2019s Homeless Action Network, an umbrella scheme uniting local services, charities and others working with the homeless in Greater Manchester. Just as everyone in this city has a view about homelessness, everyone has a view about Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. In January 2017, the former Labour health secretary vowed \u201cto eradicate rough sleeping by 2020\u201d if he won the mayoral election. It was a big promise. Sure enough, in May 2017 he won with 63% of the vote and immediately pledged 15% of his \u00a3110,000 salary to the Greater Manchester Mayor\u2019s charity, set up to tackle social issues, with homelessness as a priority. \u201cRising homelessness is the issue that has defined this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact it is barely getting a mention in the [2017] general election campaign tells you something about our dysfunctional political and media culture. But walk out of this building tonight and you will see the reality behind the election slogans.\u201d Jonathan Billings, chief executive officer at the Wellspring which provides support for homeless people living in Stockport. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian Burnham even managed to make fighting homelessness sexy, teaming up with the then Manchester City captain, Vincent Kompany, to launch Tackle4MCR, a charity set up by the pair to combat rough sleeping across Greater Manchester. Burnham was present at Kompany\u2019s testimonial match in September when all the profits went to Tackle4MCR, and announced that Kompany had already raised \u00a3300,000 for the mayor\u2019s A Bed Every Night scheme, which aims to guarantee all rough sleepers a bed every night, with additional support to get into secure housing. Billings is generally supportive of Burnham and A Bed Every Night, but he has his quibbles. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to end rough sleeping permanently,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to refer people, for one thing. And in Stockport it\u2019s quite misleading because it\u2019s a sleeping bag on the floor in a shared area. That\u2019s not a bed every night, is it?\u201d He welcomes the number of people helped by A Bed Every Night, but says it isn\u2019t suitable for the sharpest end of homelessness \u2013 entrenched rough sleepers with multiple issues, people such as Clive Dalrymple. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible to have to say it, but A Bed Every Night works for the easy ones \u2013 the kids who have had a row with their mum and it\u2019s just \u2018Get on the phone to Mum, get them together in a room and let\u2019s sort this out.\u2019 That kind of thing. We deal with people with complex needs, including drugs and alcohol. A Bed Every Night hasn\u2019t got any of them sorted out.\u201d Billings also worries that the city is resorting to punitive policies as Burnham\u2019s deadline for clearing Manchester of rough sleepers gets ever nearer. In February, Manchester city council announced a plan to introduce a \u201cpublic space protection order\u201d to ban antisocial behaviour, including \u201caggressive and intimidating begging\u201d, drinking in public, discarding syringes, urinating or defecating in public, and blocking building entrances and exits. The human rights group Liberty described the policy as \u201ccruel and perverse\u201d. Billings suggests the policy has unfairly targeted the homeless and achieved nothing except to shift the burden to communities outside the city centre. We tell him we\u2019re going to see Burnham the following day, and ask if he\u2019s got any message to pass on. Yes, he says \u2013 all of this. \u201cAnd one more thing, he promised to bring Vincent Kompany to the Wellspring. Well, we\u2019re still waiting.\u201d * * * While Jonathan Billings runs a regular homelessness charity, one man in Manchester has resorted to vigilante-style activism. On a sweltering June day on Deansgate in central Manchester, Stuart Potts is in shorts and shirtless, with an electronic tag attached to his ankle. Potts runs the Saving People Shelter Project, which is essentially a mobile hostel occupying abandoned buildings to house homeless people. Potts is a one-off: tough, funny, intense and off the wall. Combine Shaun Ryder with Mother Teresa and you might come close. Like many working with homeless people in the city, Potts knew Clive, but not well. He says he was quiet and kept himself to himself. \u201cI saw his work,\u201d he says. \u201cBrilliant artist.\u201d Potts has had his own struggles with mental health and addiction. He became homeless after being evicted from his flat, and was inspired to take the law into his own hands after losing a homeless friend he had helped get off the streets. \u201cI took a lad in from Rochdale,\u201d Potts says. He explains that Rochdale council had evicted his friend from a three-bedroom house after his mother died. Potts took him off the streets, weaned him off heroin with beer, then weaned him off beer and got him back on his feet. Potts says they were turfed out by their landlord after a neighbour told him he had taken in a lodger, and the young man from Rochdale died of a drugs overdose a couple weeks after returning to the streets. Potts went to live by the canal. \u201cI was sitting on the canal, homeless. Police came down and gave me a 48-hour dispersal notice not to camp anywhere within the Salford area within the next 48 hours. I asked: \u2018Where can I go? I\u2019ve got no roof over my head?\u2019 They said: \u2018Go to Manchester.\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to Manchester. I slept with my phone down my bollocks in Manchester and another homeless guy tried to take it off me while I was asleep.\u2019\u201d Instead, Potts began to research squatting. As a former locksmith, he knew a bit about getting into locked buildings. After occupying a decaying mansion in Eccles, an area of Salford, he has moved into \u2013 and out of \u2013 several abandoned buildings in the area, including a former vet\u2019s and a disused chemist\u2019s shop. At any given time, he has about 14 adults with him in these makeshift hostels. Potts has to stay one step ahead of the police, who have evicted him on several occasions. Although, oddly, the police are now referring people to his squats. \u201cWe got a phone call from the police the other day,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018Hi, is that Mr Potts?\u2019 I say: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve got a young vulnerable lady here. She has just come out of Meadowbrook mental health unit, and she\u2019s got nowhere to go. I was just wondering if there was any room at your shelters?\u2019 I say: \u2018Are you mad? You are the ones who are kicking us out, mate.\u2019\u201d He cackles at the craziness of it. Potts points out another oddity: the first time they were evicted by the police, Burnham was announcing his A Bed Every Night policy. Potts prides himself on telling it as it is to everybody, and Burnham is no exception. When he met Burnham earlier this year, Potts claims he told the mayor that within 48 hours he had housed 18 people in a functioning safe space. \u201cWe had on-site support, we had food in the cupboards, it was staffed. We\u2019ve got no money. \u2018You\u2019ve got all the money in the world and all the resources in the world and you can\u2019t even do it,\u2019\u201d Potts claims he told Burnham. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve got red tape, you haven\u2019t.\u2019 I\u2019ve got red tape! Well fuck that shit. Solve the problem!\u201d It is early September, and Potts has been evicted from two squats since we last met. He is now occupying the Unicorn hotel, a pub that recently closed in Eccles. The bar area has been transformed into an ad-hoc storage facility for donated clothes and other items. The living quarters are upstairs, and we\u2019re greeted in the lounge by residents, as well as by Tara the dog, a big, soppy white staffy-akita cross. The atmosphere is relaxed, with people watching Sky TV on a big screen and chatting. Potts says the residents share responsibilities \u2013 cooking, cleaning, DIY. He says it has not always been so harmonious. When one resident attacked him a few months ago, he hit him on the head with a frying pan in self-defence. Paul Doyle from Bolton, who is living in the Unicorn, has been homeless for several years, and says he has never been happier in that time. He has first-hand experience of A Bed Every Night and its emergency Narrowgate shelter project. \u201cYou don\u2019t get proper food,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cNow and again Greggs donated. But sometimes we\u2019d just have a bowl of soup at night.\u201d Potts says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a rat\u201d in Narrowgate, and likens it to a \u201crefugee camp\u201d in which \u201c30 to 35 people are bunked up\u201d. * * * The mayor of Greater Manchester\u2019s office in Manchester city centre, is smart, minimalist and corporate. It could not be more different from the Unicorn hotel. Andy Burnham stands up and points to a painting above his desk of a rough sleeper wrapped in a sleeping bag. The artwork also features on A Bed Every Night\u2019s website and literature. It was painted by another homeless man, but Burnham is aware of Clive. \u201cClive was well known locally \u2013 his paintings were loved, and people tried their best to help him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a tragedy that this talented artist was living out the last years of his life on the streets of Manchester.\u201d Burnham says eradicating street homelessness remains his \u201cNo 1 priority\u201d and that he is staking his political legacy on it. Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian. We put some of the criticisms about A Bed Every Night to him. \u201cI think the quality of accommodation is quite variable [and] more single-room provision would be good,\u201d he concedes. \u201cThere are some people who really like the sort of company or camaraderie of being in a big space. Others would rather turn the key, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d He admits that there needs to be at least the option of single-room provision for women. Are women separated from men? \u201cYes \u2026 I think nearly in all of our locations. I wouldn\u2019t like to say in all.\u201d Burnham cites Greater Manchester\u2019s first decline in rough sleeping numbers for eight years \u2013 229 rough sleepers were recorded in the 2018 snapshot, compared with 278 the previous year \u2013 as a measure of his success. He credits the falling figures to A Bed Every Night: \u201cThat was the thing that was most responsible for that change. Because London carried on seeing an increase; Birmingham carried on seeing an increase. Now I won\u2019t overclaim for it, but I think that was a significant thing.\u201d The statistics, however, tell a more complex story than Burnham suggests. Rough sleeping figures in Greater Manchester have declined, but the figures in central Manchester have increased by 31%, which suggests that the problem is merely migrating to the centre. Moreover, A Bed Every Night was launched in November 2018, and the decline Burnham refers to was measured on a single night snapshot during autumn 2018. We tell him activists have complained about the begging ban in the city centre, saying it is penalising genuinely homeless people. \u201cThere\u2019s not a ban on begging,\u201d Burnham says with a hint of frustration in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a more considered approach, and actually what we\u2019ve agreed with Greater Manchester police is that it\u2019s a supportive approach. We will not penalise people in Greater Manchester for want of a home. We will just not do that. A lot of people claim that this is done, and there may be individual officers who have done things that do equate to that, but it\u2019s not the policy of the force.\u201d Does he regret saying he would end rough sleeping by 2020? \u201cI wasn\u2019t making what you would call a traditional target,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cI issued my commitment to make it more of a wake-up call to the system. And I think it has had that effect.\u201d But the bottom line is that it was a pledge, and many people, including the Wellspring\u2019s Jonathan Billings, argue it was an unrealistic one. Aloma Owens, sister of Clive Dalrymple, photographed in Memphis, Tennessee, where she now lives. Photographer: Phillip Parker/Getty Images Burnham says he knows he could have worded it differently to give himself wriggle room, but he wasn\u2019t interested in doing so. \u201cThe team here said I should have said: \u2018End the need for rough sleeping,\u2019 because you can\u2019t force people into a shelter if they don\u2019t want to because they have a concern about it. In retrospect, if I had said \u2018end the need for\u2019, that probably would have been a wiser thing to have done. But I wasn\u2019t in the space of wanting to play semantics with it. Honestly, I don\u2019t regret it. I feel in spirit I\u2019m meeting it by creating 400 places every single night from October until the middle of June.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that Clive, with his claustrophobia and complex needs, would have accepted a sleeping bag in a room crammed with 30-plus people. He had a place at Newbury House in Manchester \u2013 supported accommodation set up to cope with homeless people with addiction issues and mental health problems \u2013 but his aversion to being inside was so profound that he discharged himself from hospital the day after undergoing heart surgery and returned to the streets. He died five weeks later. Ray struggles with Clive\u2019s choices: \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could opt to live on the streets, I really don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ll never understand.\u201d Ray wonders if his brother\u2019s problems stemmed from his childhood, and says he often wonders what Clive was running from when he left home at 13. Aloma Owens is Clive\u2019s sister. She is a year older and grew up with him in the same household in Glasgow. Owens juggles two jobs: one as a material handler for Federal Express at Memphis international airport; the other as a table games dealer at the MGM Goldstrike casino on the Mississippi river. She has just finished a shift at the airport when she speaks to us on the phone. Owens says people thought she and Clive were twins because they looked so alike. \u201cI was always with him. It was me and him together pretty much when we were young,\u201d Owens says. She says the family weren\u2019t poor growing up, but weren\u2019t rich either. \u201cWe had a nice house, food on the table, a garden. We never had any problems.\u201d She remembers how adventurous he was as a child. \u201cHe would climb the rooftops, jump on the backs of garbage trucks, getting a little ride. I was a little tomboy. Anything my brothers did, I was like: \u2018I\u2019m coming, too.\u2019\u201d Owens was just as surprised as Ray when she discovered Clive\u2019s paintings, as he wasn\u2019t at all arty when they were young. But she disagrees strongly with Ray about one thing \u2013 the dancing. \u201cWe were in a break-dancing group, and we used to dance in the streets \u2013 street busking \u2013 in Scotland.\u201d Ray says he was a stiff dancer? \u201cHe was an excellent dancer,\u201d she insists. \u201cWe were in a group called Street Damage and got a lot of gigs out of that, so he was real good.\u201d Owens says Clive\u2019s charm got him out of sticky situations in his childhood. One night, when he and Owens were 10 and 11, they were out with two friends and decided to pick some apples from a tree in a private garden. \u201cA man started shouting: \u2018Get out of here!\u2019 So, everybody started running, but poor Clive was so slow. He got caught. The man took him in the house and the other two guys took off and I\u2019m waiting on my brother. Do you know, Clive came out with some food, some money and some apples. A big bag of apples! So, I said: \u2018What did you tell him?\u2019 He said: \u2018I told him the boys were threatening us and making us come and pick the apples.\u2019 So he knew how to talk to people and get himself out of things the right way.\u201d Although Owens describes a happy childhood, the pair had to endure racist abuse. \u201cWe used to get called \u2018nignogs\u2019, and the \u2018twin Twix pack\u2019, and \u2018there\u2019s the two Guinnesses coming\u2019. Crazy stuff,\u201d she says. Owens took the abuse in her stride, but she says Clive took it to heart. After Clive died, Owen was shown a letter that one of her siblings had received from Clive. Owens gets emotional when reading it out loud, as Clive talks about missing their mum, who followed her to the US in 1991. Clive ran away from home with his older brother Vernon when he was 13. Owens never fully discovered what happened to Clive during that period. When she asks Vernon about it, she says, he just cries. Ray is equally in the dark, but learned from Clive, during a rare moment of openness, that he sought out their father at around this time. According to Ray, he was a selfish, violent man with a callous attitude towards his many children. \u201cWho\u2019s for me, I\u2019m for them,\u201d was his motto, Ray says. \u201cClive told me he ran away from home in Glasgow to Liverpool,\u201d Ray recalls. \u201cSo Clive sat outside our dad\u2019s house because he wasn\u2019t home, and my dad came back from wherever he was and asked: \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 He fed him, put him in his car and took him to the motorway and said: \u2018Thumb a lift back to Scotland.\u2019\u201d Ray sobs quietly, and apologises. \u201cIt tears me up thinking that a parent can do something like that to a kid.\u201d Ameera Ramzan says that, after discharging himself from hospital, Clive returned to the streets to make a living. According to Ramzan, he had two bleeds on the brain and had heart surgery twice in the space of a year before he died. \u201cNobody should be left on the street like that,\u201d she says. When we ask Manchester University NHS foundation trust, which runs Manchester Royal Infirmary, if Clive had a mental health assessment and whether he was in a fit state to leave hospital, the trust says it is unable to comment on individual cases. Five weeks after leaving hospital, Clive died from pulmonary heart failure. Ramzan is still haunted by his death. \u201cI was coming out of the hospital and I\u2019ve got a clear bag with his name on it with just a few belongings. And I\u2019m hugging this bag with his clothes in it, thinking: \u2018What is this?\u2019 This is all this man\u2019s got for 52 years in this world \u2013 one bag.\u201d Aloma Owens is also trying to come to terms with his death. She is grieving for a brother who couldn\u2019t have been closer as a child, but was a stranger as an adult. After he left home at 13, she only saw him on a handful of occasions before she went to live in the US at the age of 21. How does she remember him? \u201cBreak-dancing, happy thoughts, y\u2019know.\u201d Her voice quivers. \u201cI get really emotional. I look at the pictures of his childhood and this is how I remember Clive. This is how I remember his face. I don\u2019t know the other part of him. I don\u2019t know the adult pictures that my brother sends me. I know that\u2019s Clive, but I don\u2019t know that Clive.\u201d * * * On 9 October, the homeless squatters were evicted from the Unicorn hotel. Stuart Potts livestreamed the eviction, and then occupied the Albert Edward pub in Eccles. For all his good deeds, Potts has a knack for getting himself in trouble, and was arrested after letting off fireworks during the two-minute silence on Remembrance Sunday. He told Manchester magistrates court they were a tribute intended to mirror the cannons fired during the televised service in London. The judge didn\u2019t accept his argument, and Potts is serving a 16-week prison sentence. At the end of October, Manchester city council announced it had dropped plans to fine people \u00a3100 for \u201caggressive or intimidating begging\u201d. Burnham is rapidly running out of time to meet his impossible deadline, but he says that he feels he has kept his promise in spirit: a year on from its launch, more than 2,600 people have accessed temporary accommodation through A Bed Every Night and 817 rough sleepers across Greater Manchester have moved off the streets into longer-term accommodation. \u201cIf people think I haven\u2019t done enough, it\u2019s up to them,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cAnd if they want to vote me out on that basis, they should do that. I\u2019m perfectly happy for people to say at the election: \u2018Well, sorry, you said \u2026\u2019 But, no, I don\u2019t consider it a failure to have looked after so many people through A Bed Every Night.\u201d Meanwhile, Ray is still struggling to come to terms with Clive\u2019s death. Ray tries to tell himself that his brother was his own man, a loner who couldn\u2019t be helped. But he doesn\u2019t quite believe it. \u201cI feel as if I have failed him. I do feel I should have gone to Manchester looking for him, to try to bring him home. But I can\u2019t put that right.\u201d One comfort is discovering after his death that Clive was such a talented artist. The painting that Katy Cavanagh bought from Clive tells the story of his life so well, he says \u2013 storm clouds and choppy waters on the high seas. But there is one feature Ray missed on first viewing: a tiny ship among the giant waves. \u201cI reckon that\u2019s him,\u201d Ray says. \u201cA little ship in the storm.\u201d Additional reporting by Eric Allison If you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.
