Taken aback refers to that parlous situation when the wind shifts, the sails fill from the other side and the ship stops. If you were one of those with little else to do than watch the live stream of the rust line growing on the stricken vessel, you could have been swinging the lead. You might have been skiving at the time but you almost certainly would not have been swinging a greased lead weight over the side of a ship to determine depth and sample the seabed. If they are shorthanded (lacking in crew), swamped (submerged) and not making any headway, who can blame those at the helm for wanting to keelhaul you (tearing you to shreds on the barnacles under the ship and drowning you)? One can take nautical vocabulary to its bitter end (end of a line)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
