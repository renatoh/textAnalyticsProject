This, however, is a bit bonkers, given that anybody sensible knows that weddings are way more fun when you're on your own. But OK: let's assume that, it being the season for people moseying down the aisle or non-church equivalent, you don't want to spend all summer schlepping to the celebrations alone. And in certain circumstances, I can see your point: given that most weddings are now more lengthy and more costly to attend than your actual summer holiday, you might well want someone to split the bill with. (Indulge me in a brief aside: new frock/suiting, shoes, hat \u2013 I suppose; two nights in a \"charming\" rustic B&amp;B \u2013 necessary unless you can bear to drink apple juice all day and drive home; drinks all round \u2013 of course; but wedding list \u2013 no. Household gifts were designed for people who didn't already have a home filled to the brim with overpriced coffee-makers. Everyone else: stop it. It's greedy.) Phew! That's better. Now let us meander back to the point. The obvious thing, of course, is not to tell them. Instead think of an occasion that requires dressing up \u2013 a day at the races, say. Then add a bit of incentive: you've won a ton of money on a scratchie and fancy blowing it all on a horse, for example. Then just deploy the central locking and put your foot down. By the time \"Here Comes The Bride\" starts up, it'll be too late. If you have little or no self-respect, you might also try pleading or bribing (never rule out pleading or bribing, by the way). But by far the best method, as in so many situations, is a crafty bit of reverse psychology. Here's a speech I prepared earlier: \"I cannot believe it [roll eyes]. Another wedding! And all the way to Smugsetshire on the weekend I'd set aside for clearing out the attic. This hotel's going to cost a fortune if it's got a spa/nine-hole golf course/casino on site. And the bride/groom! It's his/her nine gorgeous brothers/sisters that get on my nerves! Shall we give it a miss?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
