It was not only the opening ceremony that took the breath away, and as Brendon McCullum launched ball after ball over the ropes, you could imagine a weight being lifted from the shoulders of the IPL commissioner, Lalit Modi. High up in the stands, Andrew Wildblood, the joint-brains behind the competition, surveyed the scene with quiet jubilation. And, while one or two of the Indian newspapers have been critical of the one-sided nature of the contest - Bangalore Royal Challengers lost by 140 runs, a mauling in Twenty20 terms and last night the Delhi Daredevils beat Shane Warne's Rajasthan Royals by nine wickets with 29 balls remaining - the general feeling was that the IPL had hit the ground not so much running as sprinting. There is a long way to go: 55 more matches in 42 days, and then - if the \u00a31bn sale of the global TV rights is anything to go by - a further nine years of fixtures pitting the Royal Challengers against Kolkata Knight Riders and, following yesterday's example in Mohali, Kings XI Punjab against Chennai Super Kings. Claims about the game's future must surely wait. The present, though, is going nicely. India has been waiting for the IPL for some time now, even while the fanatically supported national side were drawing a tense Test series with South Africa recently. The priorities have been clear. The day before a domestic one-day final at Bangalore's M Chinnaswamy stadium, host to Friday's curtain-raiser, IPL stars arrived for a hectic photo shoot that ended up damaging the outfield. Not only were their poses watched by more fans than the game the next day, but the humble cricketers of Central Zone and West Zone had to contend with a less-than-pristine surface. To object would have been to swim against the tide: at times, the publicity has felt more like propaganda. Huge billboards in the streets of Bangalore scream 'No players. Only warriors'; TV chat shows barely go five minutes without a nod to the Daredevils or the Royals; and the same players are being asked the same questions over and over again. Rahul Dravid, captain of the Bangalore franchise, must be sick of pointing out that the tournament's success depends on the quality of the cricket. For McCullum and Mike Hussey, who yesterday cracked 114 not out off 54 balls for the Super Kings, the message appears to have sunk in. Not far beneath the surface, though, lie awkward questions. Foremost is that of loyalty, both the players' and the fans'. The vast sums of money involved - seven of the eight franchises overspent at February's player auction despite a budget of $5m - have threatened to make protestations of team spirit ring hollow, although Mark Boucher was honest when he wrote that 'the prospect of financial gain is surely uppermost in the minds of a lot of players'. It is a short hop to cynicism. The agent of one big name out here reportedly joked that his man could always 'do a hamstring after three or four games' and still pocket his cheque. But, by and large, the players have delicately sidestepped the financial issue - one that renders comparisons with Kerry Packer's own revolution in the late 1970s invalid. Back then, cricketers were treated like the administrators' playthings. Now, they know their own worth. After McCullum broke the Twenty20 world record - 158 not out off 73 balls - he admitted he had not felt so nervous for a long time. The presence at the other end of Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting might just have focused his mind. The fans will be trickier to win round. McCullum's antics reportedly boosted ticket sales in Kolkata ahead of today's match at Eden Gardens, but the turnout in Mohali yesterday was disappointing. Clearly, support cannot simply be bought. As Bobilli Vijay Kumar put it in the Times of India: 'Despite all the witty ads on television, no Delhiite or Chennaiite is treating the team from their cities as their own as yet.' The lack of local tribalism was in evidence at the M Chinnaswamy, where the biggest cheer came before the game had even started. As each of the captains was called on to the stage by a near-hysterical Ravi Shastri, acting as MC, the stadium erupted for Sachin Tendulkar, ostensibly representing the Mumbai Indians, but in reality an ambassador for an entire nation. McCullum's innings confused matters too. He might have been representing the Knight Riders, who could one day become the Royal Challengers' mortal enemies, but his blitzkrieg demanded a generous hand from everyone. Even the cheerleaders, imported especially from the NFL's Washington Redskins to strut for the home side, looked impressed. Time alone will tell whether partiality is exportable, but yesterday, for the second time in two games, the fireworks were provided by a batsman from the visiting team. A possibly apocryphal story is doing the rounds that when the Knight Riders signed David Hussey for $625,000 (\u00a3300,000), they thought they were getting his more established older brother, Mike, who ended up with Chennai for $350,000. That price tag felt like a snip as the elder Hussey whacked a Punjab attack containing his Australian compatriots Brett Lee and James Hopes for 10 sixes and seven fours to lift the Super Kings to 240 for five after Mahendra Singh Dhoni had opted to bat first. While Hopes was responding with 71 in 33 balls, the Kings XI had an outside chance, but the dismissal of Yuvraj Singh for 23 was crucial, and when Kumar Sangakkara perished for 54 trying to hit his fellow Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan into the stands, the game was up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
