Many workers, however, are unaware of what their daily energy consumption can cost - and if there are any savings they can make without affecting their work. The Electrisave - invented in Australia, where it is called the Cent-O-Meter - measures exactly how much electricity your office is using in the currency we all understand best: pounds and pennies. Clip the sensor on to your existing meter box and the wireless transmitter sends a real-time reading of the power being used to a portable monitor that can be up to 30m away. This reading shows, in pence, the cost of electricity being used, as well as power consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, temperature and humidity. The device is sensitive enough to measure the savings made by switching off a single 20-watt lightbulb overnight. As the Carbon Trust, which provides free advice on reducing energy use, points out, businesses can quickly cut their heating, lighting and power bills by 10% or more without any capital investment. Making good use of natural daylight wherever possible can reduce lighting costs by up to 15%, whereas leaving office equipment on all night and at weekends can quadruple them. The Electrisave lets you monitor each energy saving method to see which is the most effective. It also has an alarm that can be set to go off when excessive amounts of electricity are being used. As Melissa Hardy, Electrisave operations director, says: \"It tells you instantly how much your electricity is costing at that point and offers the opportunity to do something about it. We're only talking pence, but little things add up to big changes.\" Energy saving is one of the easiest ways to cut carbon emissions and combat climate change, and offices can help by making small changes to their daily working routine. Try turning off the lights in your workspace at the end of each day, buy a photocopier with a power save mode so that it goes into standby when not used for long periods, and don't heat unused space such as corridors or storage rooms. The Carbon Trust has a list of useful tips for saving energy in the workplace: www.thecarbontrust.co.uk/energy/pages/page_31.asp The Electrisave is available to buy online at www.electrisave.co.uk for \u00a379.95.
