For many, it\u2019s a vital service, but the Guardian would like to find out if there are any instances when a CAMHS record can be held against young adults when it comes to applying for certain jobs. Is this you? Or do you know someone who has been affected in this way? We have previously reported on issues associated with transitioning from Camhs to adult care, including speaking with readers who felt abandoned at the age of 18 and beyond. We are now looking to speak with people who experienced successful treatment in Camhs but who feel there\u2019s an issue when looking for work months or even years later. In some professions, such as teaching, the armed forces and certain medical careers, disclosing past mental health issues is mandatory. We want to find out more about your experiences with disclosure in these and other professions \u2013 including whether, or how, policies or procedures were explained to you. How was the issue dealt with more broadly, and what was the outcome? How did this make you feel? Share your experiences If you accessed Camhs services when you were younger and you feel that this has had any impact on your work and career opportunities you can fill out the encrypted form below \u2013 only the Guardian has access to your contributions and we won\u2019t publish anything without speaking to you first. Tell us how your life has been affected with particular focus on employment related issues or concerns, or times when you felt unsure of policies around disclosure. Give as much detail as you can, including dates of treatment or events you describe, if you are able. If you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here.
