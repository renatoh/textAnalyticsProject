He moved every minister apart from Des Browne at defence (and handed him the extra duty of Scotland) in a reshuffle that felt natural. If there was less drama than some had predicted - no shock big name so far from business or the Conservatives - then there was also less brutality. While making some concilliatory gestures to opponents of the Iraq war, Mr Brown treated Tony Blair's supporters with tolerance and rewarded his own friends judiciously. This was no sudden takeover by a kilted Brownite horde, rushing over Hadrian's Wall to stick a dirk in the backs of old enemies. For all the new red boxes handed out yesterday, the reshaped top team is a recalibration of Labour's purpose in government, not a fundamental reconsideration. The new prime minister has shown himself ready to correct Mr Blair's errors - with a great improvement at the Foreign Office - but has done nothing revolutionary. It was appropriate that the new cabinet sat down on its first day to discuss the floods affecting large parts of England; the prosaic work of government replacing the artificial entertainment of Mr Blair's departure. Yesterday was a serious day, not a glamorous one. Mr Brown has been kind - too kind - to all the ministers who took part in Labour's deputy leadership contest. Peter Hain was lucky to secure promotion and Harriet Harman now lays claim to five titles and four jobs, the more partisan of which sits oddly with her impartial duties as leader of the house. He has re-engineered large parts of government, turning the remains of the DTI, stripped of trade, into a diminished department instantly dubbed Berr - Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Simple abolition would have been kinder. Education is split into two baronies, one for higher education and skills under John Denham (a welcome return for a capable opponent of the Iraq war) and one for children and schools, a sign of Mr Brown's focus on education. So is his decision to give the children's ministry to Ed Balls, the closest of friends: he takes charge of everything from obesity to Asbos at what might be better called the department for building tomorrow's society. Will it work? There are risks in putting grand plans ahead of reliable administration, though Mr Balls can manage both. No such issues at health, where Alan Johnson will provide a calming and credible head of a department that needs to win the support of NHS workers and voters. A slightly smaller cabinet will contain fewer women - although Tessa Jowell, left with the Olympics, is among those who will attend without being full members. There are more young faces as well as one that no one had expected - Tory defector Shaun Woodward at Northern Ireland. But the most closely watched appointments have traditionally been those to the three great offices of state, Home, Foreign and Treasury. Do they still justify that description? The new home secretary, Jacqui Smith, has fallen behind Jack Straw at justice in the cabinet order of precedence. Both are sensible appointments, faced with the work of extinguishing flames left by John Reid. Alistair Darling will not threaten Gordon Brown's legacy as chancellor, but neither will he have anything like his power. Only the Foreign Office has been boosted, with David Miliband making an elegant start. He will be assisted by Mark Malloch Brown, once a UN critic of Iraq and now attending cabinet as a minister. His appointment was a daring exception to an otherwise measured reshaping of government. Mr Brown has carried out an intelligent pruning and replanting, with hopes for future growth. The planning has been extensive but the benefits will not be immediate. After waiting 13 years for the job, Mr Brown is still thinking of the long term."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
