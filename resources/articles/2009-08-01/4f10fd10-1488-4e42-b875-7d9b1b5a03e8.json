He was serving with the 2nd Battalion the Mercian Regiment when he was killed by an improvised explosive device east of Gereshk, Helmand province. The unnamed soldier was with a vehicle patrol that had dismounted to secure the area on foot when the explosion happened. His next of kin have been informed. Lieutenant Colonel Mark Wenham, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: \"Each and every loss that we sustain in Helmand sends reverberations throughout the brigade. Today we mourn the loss of a soldier who died working to make Afghanistan a better place. He was prepared to makemade the ultimate sacrifice, displaying bravery that was second to none. Our thoughts are with his family and we offer them our deepest and heartfelt condolences at this tragic time.\" The death comes two days after three Paras were killed in a Taliban ambush in southern Afghanistan. They were named as Corporal Kevin Mulligan, 26, who was the father of an unborn child, Lance Corporal Dale Hopkins, 23, and Private Kyle Adams, 21. The death toll among British troops has now reached 196 since operations began in 2001. Today there were fresh concerns over the Ministry of Defence's procurement policy in Afghanistan, following complaints over a lack of helicopter support and sufficiently armoured vehicles for British troops. Former commander of the armed forces in Afghanistan Colonel Richard Kemp described as \"extraordinary\" pictures published in the News of the World showing rows of armoured vehicles, including Ridgbacks, Bulldogs and Mastiffs, parked at a facility in Gloucestershire. The MoD said the equipment at the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency site was to be fitted with armour and radios and undergo testing, but Kemp said the numbers involved were \"disproportionate\" and questioned why the potentially life-saving hardware was not at the front line. \"We are continuously told, by people from the chief of the general staff downward, that there is a shortage of the right vehicles in theatre,\" he told the newspaper. \"It seems extraordinary that they should be sitting here parked up doing nothing whatsoever when they are needed out there.\" Ministers have also revealed that the cost of addressing the military's helicopter shortage has risen by \u00a3700m to \u00a31.7bn. The Future Lynx programme is intended to equip British forces with a successor model to the Lynx helicopter called the Wildcat. The cost increase was seized on by Tory defence spokesman Liam Fox as raising \"serious questions about the competence of the procurement programme\". \"The first duty of the MoD is to get the armed forces what they need when they need it. In that, they have clearly failed,\" Fox said. Ministers have previously quoted a price of \u00a31bn for the \"development and manufacture\" of the new Wildcat helicopters, but in a written statement, the defence equipment minister, Quentin Davies, said the \"total cost of the [Wildcat] project is forecast to be some \u00a31.7bn\". An MoD spokesman said additional agreements with contractors for support functions such as testing, training and spare parts had pushed the cost up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
