The Child Trust Fund, already nicknamed the Baby Bond, will provide a cash lump sum to all children at birth that will be kept in special accounts until they reach adulthood. The Gateway Sav ings scheme will match savings by low-income earners with direct contributions paid by the Government. The schemes are designed to tackle child poverty and encourage saving among the 16 million people who have none. Launching the schemes, Education Secretary David Blunkett said: 'The new Child Trust Fund and the Savings Gateway will provide a vital first step on the road to self reliance - taking people out of the dependency culture and giving them a real stake in society. 'Young people will start out in life with financial backing behind them... It's about the state helping you to help yourself - a something-for-something approach so that people can take greater responsibility for their own future.' Details of the two schemes are open to consultation, but as a starting point the Government has suggested that access to money in the Child Trust Fund should be restricted until the child reaches 18 or 21. The money (\u00a3800 is used as an example for children from low-income families, and \u00a3400 for others) could be paid as one lump sum or in tranches at birth, five, 11 and 16. As 720,000 babies are born on average each year, paying just the lower \u00a3400 sum could cost \u00a3288 million a year. Parents and other interested parties could make contributions to the funds on their behalf, with possible tax advantages. The Child Trust Fund could also be used as a link to 'broader social concerns' such as community service and educational achievement. Participating community groups could reward service by children with credits that have a cash value only when paid into their Child Trust Fund. The concept of the Saving Gateway has been derived from the Individual Development Account in the US, where people saving towards particular objectives - housing, business or education - have limited amounts of savings matched, typically at a rate of $2 for every $1 saved. Likewise, the Government suggests that the Saving Gateway account will match savings on a pound-for-pound basis up to a maximum of \u00a350 a month, and run for a fixed period, perhaps three years. After this time, savers will be able to transfer their saved assets into an existing savings or investment scheme, such as an Isa or stakeholder pension or the Child Trust Fund. During the lifetime of the Saving Gateway, users could have access to funds - either their own contributions or the whole pot - to ensure funds are available for 'rainy day' contingencies. One of the biggest questions is how the money should be invested. Because the Saving Gateway will run for a short period, it is likely to take the form of a low-risk deposit account. But the 18- or 21-year lifespan of the Child Trust Fund means that children could benefit more by taking a higher-risk strategy - investing in equities and fixed-interest securities. James Budden, marketing manager for Jump, the Witan investment trust savings scheme for children, says that \u00a3800 invested in the average building society account over the past 18 years would now be worth \u00a32,065. The same amount invested in Jump would have grown to \u00a310,785. He also argues that children will benefit more if the Government invests the full amount at birth, rather than staggering sums through the 18 years: 'We would like to see the full \u00a3800 for chil dren of less well-off families invested for the full 18 years. A top-up at the age of 16 is going to have little overall impact being invested for just two years.' Friendly societies, which have offered low-premium, tax-efficient savings schemes for children for many years, consider themselves well placed to run Child Trust Funds. David White of the Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society (Twefs) says: 'We know from our work that it's the case that parents aren't aware of how much it costs to put children through higher education and give them a good start in life. And crucially we understand how to make small savings with tax incentives work - Twefs has produced average annual returns of 10 per cent from premiums of \u00a3150 a year.' Martin Barnes, director of the Child Poverty Action Group, welcomes the proposals but wishes that the Government had concentrated on sorting out the Social Fund first. The Social Fund pays out money to people on income support who need to make one-off, big purchases, but Barnes says the fund's cap of \u00a3100m a year is inadequate, and many of those in need do not apply for money because they know that the vast majority are rejected. 'While I welcome the idea of providing capital to give children a good start in life, there are families out there who can't afford to buy a cooker,' he says. The Government has issued no timescale for introducing the schemes, whose details are wide open to consultation. It plans to publish another, firmer consultative document around the Pre-Budget Report this autumn. However, most people agree that one thing about the announcement is certain: it means the start of the election campaign is imminent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
