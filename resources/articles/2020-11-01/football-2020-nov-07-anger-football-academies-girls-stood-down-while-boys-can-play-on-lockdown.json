As girls at club academies from Brighton to Manchester United were being told to hang up their boots for four weeks, boys were being reassured that it was business as usual. From last Thursday, women\u2019s elite development squads (age 16-21) were forbidden from attending training or playing matches by the Football Association because they do not fall under the government\u2019s elite protocols. Girls at Regional Talent Clubs (RTCs) (under 9s to under 16s) were also told everything was on hold. On Friday, the FA said: \u201cThe Barclays FA WSL Academies and FA Girls Regional Talent Clubs are to be suspended during this period as their resources \u2013 including finances and personnel \u2013 do not meet the necessary \u2018elite\u2019 protocols required.\u201d Boys\u2019 academy level football at 15-plus will continue, with some exemptions for boys\u2019 RTCs as well. Sally Horrox, a women\u2019s football expert who worked at the FA to help develop, launch and run the Women\u2019s Super League, and is now managing partner of Y Sport, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s football has come a long way in the past decade but this decision illustrates how much more work and investment is needed at all levels to ensure elite boys and girls are treated the same. \u201cThere is an increasing number of brilliant young girls in the academy pathways but the clubs simply do not have the staff, infrastructure or resources to meet the \u2018professional\u2019 protocols to allow them to continue to train.\u201d Paul Spencer, whose daughter, now 14, has been training at a north-west RTC for four years expressed his anger: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst bit of discrimination I\u2019ve seen. Football is my daughter\u2019s life, it is for all the girls at the RTC. \u201cBy pushing the girls to one side, what does that tell them? They\u2019re asking themselves, the boys can play, why can\u2019t we? \u201cWhoever decided girls\u2019 football wasn\u2019t good enough to carry on is a disgrace. Equal rights mean equal rights, not my daughter crying her eyes out as boys carry on and they can\u2019t.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
