But on Wednesday in the House of Commons the member for Bolsover hit the bullseye. Ed Miliband threw his arms up in gleeful appreciation. Even Conservatives, enduring one of their darkest political days of recent times, guffawed. Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, had just made a statement at the dispatch box in a desperate attempt to save his political career. Accused of inappropriate links with Rupert Murdoch and his executives, Hunt denied he had done anything wrong. Instead he laid the blame at the door of his special adviser, Adam Smith. Skinner rose theatrically to his feet. \"The culture secretary's adviser has now lost his job,\" he growled. \"Does that not prove the theory that when posh boys are in trouble, they sack the servants?\" It was not so much the class element of his jibe that struck a chord but the idea that once again here was a Tory politician passing the buck to the man below. Over the past few days something important has changed in the mood of Westminster politics. The shift had also been evident half an hour earlier, during prime minister's questions. As he prepared to take on David Cameron, Miliband had received some advice in his ear from the man sitting on his right. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls leaned over and whispered a line he thought the Labour leader could use to good effect against the prime minister. Hours earlier news had come through that the UK had gone back into in recession. \"Call it 'a recession \u2026 made in Downing Street',\" Balls told his boss. For its first 23 months in opposition, Labour, hobbled by its own record and the deficit it left behind, has been unable to play the economic blame game against the Tories and Liberal Democrats with any success at all. The coalition has attributed the nation's financial woes and the resulting need for cuts \u2013and much else with it \u2013 to 13 years of Labour profligacy and, broadly speaking, the public accepted its case. But when Miliband took Balls's advice and pinned responsibility for the double dip recession on the current occupants of N0s 10 and 11 Downing Street, his charge had a sudden resonance. It worked in the chamber and later on TV. Labour MPs cheered and the Tories were the ones looking awkward. Cameron's reply that, \"we will not let anyone forget who got us into this mess in the first place\", sounded tired, where it would have resonated a few weeks before. The prime minister appeared angry rather than persuasive, like a man who knew he was losing the power of his best argument. Politics was entering a new phase; Tory excuses after two years in office seemed limp, inappropriate, weak. As one former Labour minister put it: \"If Ed Miliband had blamed bad economic figures on Osborne two months ago, the Conservatives would have had a field day and thrown it straight back at him. Now he can do it.\" The last month has destroyed the Tories' reputation for competence which enabled them for so long to breezily attribute all that went wrong to their predecessors' failings. Osborne's bungled budget \u2013 a political disaster that caused arguments over pasty taxes, charity taxes and granny taxes \u2013 has been vital in changing the dynamics and shifting perceptions. By undermining the administration's credibility for governing, and damaging its claims to fairness, it has raised questions about whether Osborne and Cameron could really improve the economy at all. In recent days Ed Miliband's team has developed a new refrain that shadow ministers have enjoyed reciting. \"It is one thing to be heartless, but if you are heartless and hopeless you are in trouble.\" What has made the last week so toxic is the way news of a new recession has coincided with the row over Jeremy Hunt and his links to Rupert Murdoch. Just as the government's economic competence was being questioned the lethal ingredient of sleaze was added to the mix. Labour, which had struggled since losing the 2010 election to devise decent lines of attack, was suddenly spoiled for choice. \"This is a government of rich people for rich people that leaves ordinary people behind,\" said an aide to Miliband on Friday. \"It is a government that spends its time thinking about the rich so it can extract favours in return. Look at the Murdoch affair, look at the way it offers access to ministers in return for donations.\" Ahead of a week of local and mayoral elections, the coalition, scarred by it own blundering and damaged by the smell of scandal is on the back foot, knowing it has to face voters on its own record, not that of those who had come before. The sense that the coalition has been too willing to palm off responsibility for mistakes on others is deeply held not just in the Labour party but across Whitehall too. So much so that on Monday the former cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell, normally the most restrained and loyal of mandarins, went on Radio 4, accusing Cameron's administration of dumping on the civil service for pretty much every mishap that has beset it. \"When governments go through difficult patches you are looking for who you can blame,\" he said in a highly unusual intervention for a former official of his seniority. \"The issue comes up of, 'Well, let's try and blame the civil service'. It does not usually work and I don't think it will work this time either.\" He was asked if he had decided to speak out after discussions with other top mandarins and dodged the question in a way that made clear such discussions had taken place. There was more than a hint of a civil service revolt. The next day O'Donnell's central point was born out by events when Hunt tried to get cover for himself by saying that Jonathan Stephens, the permanent secretary (top civil servant) at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, had approved Adam Smith's role as a go-between between his office and Murdoch's News Corp. Interviewed by the public accounts committee on Thursday, however, Stephens refused 10 times to confirm this was the case. Was the civil servant refusing to save his master? Behind the scenes, resentment has been building for almost two years. Civil servants feel that this government, as O'Donnell also indicated, has too often rubbished the work of its predecessor even where there was evidence that its work was good. Mandarins feel it is part of a rightwing Tory antipathy towards anything to do with the state. Civil servants say in private that some ministers came into their jobs with an ideological view that the civil service was a cumbersome, bureaucratic obstacle to swift action and a drag on progress. In exactly that vein, some ministers have been quick to dump on the mandarins when things go wrong. Such was the case when the home secretary, Theresa May, blamed the senior civil servant at the UK Border Agency, Brodie Clark, for relaxing border controls at airports after a row blew up over immigration checks last year. Before that, education secretary Michael Gove is said to have lambasted servants over a fiasco involving the Building Schools for the Future project, within a few months of entering government. Many in his department are said to dislike the way Gove operates. The public too seems to be rumbling the government's game, with fewer people willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. In just two months the opinion polls have seen the Tories fall from a position neck and neck with Labour to being up to 13 points behind. Labour is also eating away at the Tories' lead on economic competence as gloom about the future spreads and faith in ministers ebbs. Two out of five people believe the economy will worsen over the next year and their income will fall, according to polling from market research agency TNS-BRMB. As time passes, Tory MPs fear that they will be increasingly held to account. They also worry that the coalition partners will turn on each other. On Friday former defence secretary Liam Fox said the UK economy was in desperate need of growth in order to generate increased revenues. As he did so he tore into the Liberal Democrats for preventing deregulation. \"Resistance to deregulation largely came from the Liberal Democrats,\" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. \"Two things need to be pointed out to them. First, that they make up only one sixth \u2013 not one half \u2013 of the coalition and must expect that Conservative economic ideas will be dominant. \"Second, that if the economy does not improve, they can expect a very unhappy date in 2015 with the voters, and their antipathy to labour market reform makes this more likely.\" Liberal Democrats were furious. They know that as the heat is turned up on Cameron, large elements of his party will increasingly blame them for government mistakes and lack of direction. The outlook for Cameron in the short term is not a promising one. Most of the austerity cuts are only just biting now. There is little chance of an economic upturn for months, even years. Then there is the shadow of the Leveson inquiry and its examination of Tory links to the Murdoch empire. The prime minister is expected to face the inquiry in June. Six other ministers have also been summoned, sources say: the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, May, justice secretary Ken Clarke, business secretary Vince Cable, Gove and, of course, Hunt. They have been asked to submit evidence to the judge and his team before the end of the month and are expected to start appearing before the inquiry at the end of May. Leveson, who is not sitting because of the need for purdah during the local elections, is likely to report initially in the autumn and then again next year. The Financial Services Authority is also now examining whether there are grounds for an investigation into the claims that Smith tipped off Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michel, News Corp's European public affairs chief, on a market-sensitive statement to the House of Commons regarding the BSkyB takeover. On Friday, Lord Justice Leveson himself seemed to have formed the impression that Cameron was trying to use his inquiry to save Hunt's career. He made clear it was not his role to rule if the culture secretary had breached the ministerial code over his handling of the News Corp bid for BSkyB. Cameron, apparently playing for time, resisted calls for a separate inquiry, compounding the impression that he did not want to confront the facts. Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow culture, media and sport secretary, saw a pattern, and another example of Tories avoiding blame and responsibility. \"It was always the case that it is the prime minister's responsibility to ensure ministers adhere to the ministerial code \u2013 not Lord Justice Leveson. \"Now Downing Street is saying that the prime minister will wait until Jeremy Hunt has given evidence to the Leveson inquiry before he decides whether to refer the case to the independent adviser. \"David Cameron is delaying the decision he knows he should make and is ducking his responsibility.\" Voters go to the polls on Thursday for local elections that will help set the political mood for the coming months. The Tories are desperately hoping that Boris Johnson hangs on as mayor of London and defeats Ken Livingstone. \"All that matters is that Boris wins,\" said one aide to Cameron. Elsewhere across the country Labour is likely to perform well, gaining around 500 seats at least. But even in the capital, Labour morale has been revived in recent days. There is a belief that Tory confusion in national government may persuade some voters to ditch Johnson and a view that the race could be closer than expected. Livingstone will issue a letter to all Londoners telling them what he will do on day one if they give him another chance. It says he will instruct officials to cut bus, tube and train fares by 7 October. The former mayor will also reverse Johnson's policing cuts, getting more officers back on to the capital's streets. A spokesman for Livingstone said: \"The Tory alternative is more of the same: fare increases, police cuts and a Tory agenda which has seen record unemployment in the capital, rising violent crime levels and a double dip recession.\" Livingstone's message will be \"blame the Tories\" \u2013 an approach that his party, nationally, is finding it can adopt more effectively by the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
