Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four. Catch up with Richard Vine's episode three blog \"We're scary \u2013 that's what we've become. We're just like them now.\" We open with Alice, screaming inconsolably for her mother, shot at point-blank range by Arby last week. She spends her time hiding out in the abandoned manor house in shock, worrying about getting her essay in on time \u2013 the confused look on Grant's face about her dedication to homework was priceless. But it's not just there for comedy value. She's been reading Crime and Punishment \u2013 and it's clear that Raskolnikov's philosophy has sunk in. \"He deduces that killing a human is right in pursuit of a higher cause,\" she tells Grant. By the end she's Utopia's answer to Hit Girl, shooting the man she holds ultimately responsible for killing her mum with a sawn-off shotgun. \"I read it. There's a boy. They torture him.\" So Arby is really \"RB\", aka \"Raisin Boy\". Not the scariest of assassin code-names, it has to be said. But there's more than a little pathos coming through in Arby's backstory as he engages in a gunpoint version of Who Do You Think You Are? with Letts and his assistant. \"That's what they called you when they forgot who you were,\" Letts reveals. Later, it's Arby on the other end of a gun \u2013 Jessica's. But was that a smile on his face? Has he remembered more than he's letting on? It's hard not to suspect a deeper connection between these two. Siblings? Clones? Graduates of the same Russian assassin breeding programme? Are Alice and Grant being primed to be the next generation of Utopia's killers? While Becky and Ian are getting cosy over some cans of Fanta, Wilson's been busy looking through Grant's drawings of the manuscript. His theory? Carvel's plan involves introducing a contaminant into the food chain \u2013 such as BSE. Becky has another take: \"What if it's not the disease that's selective? What if it's the cure?\" They adapt \"some fucking weapons-grade flu virus that can be hidden in food\", and then make a vaccine that's only effective on certain races. There's a logo in the drawings, a crescent in a circle, that's also the logo for Pergus Holdings. It's a massive conglomerate making fizzy drinks, pet food \u2013 and the packet of Bayners Crisps that Ian's has just served up to Becky for their romantic dinner. After a quick bit of smart phone research (Wilson's malware skills coming in handy again) they find the name of the Pergus CEO: Lane Monroe. His name begins with \"L\" - is he Mr Rabbit? \"I'm sick of waiting for people to save us\" The short answer is: no, Monroe's not Mr Rabbit. But he does reveal (before Alice kills him during their botched commando raid) that Pergus have dispersed the \"GCH1 protein\", via a corn modification in their products. It's broken down, used in animal feeds, which are then passed on to us \"harmlessly\" via some modified amino acids we absorb (got that?). But why? Now they've kidnapped Letts, perhaps he'll reveal all next week. I doubt it somehow. Could he be Mr Rabbit? He's supposed to be in charge, but the more time with him we spend, the more if feels like it's James Fox's assistant who's running things \u2013 kind of like the paranoid, global, chemical conspiracy version of Yes, Minister. \"Is that Jen?\" After another brush with triumph \u2013 getting the test results away from shady Professor Donaldson \u2013 it's yet another downturn for Dugdale. How much more can he take? Minister Geoff makes good on his blackmail threat and hits Dugdale where it really hurts: his wife. The sinking look on his face as he walks in to find Jen watching the compromising video of him and Anya said it all. Unlike the doctored CCTV footage of Grant at the school massacre, The Network didn't have to fake Dugdale's indiscretions, just film them. This seems to be another of their specialties. Donaldson's indignation at being branded \"Professor Pervert\" in the press after he tried to expose Sars in Hong Kong (nothing more than a string of \"unconnected respiratory infections\" in Utopia's universe) was somewhat undercut by his admission: \"I do like cocaine and prostitutes.\" Notes, quotes and queries \u2022 Some more interesting spots in the comments last week \u2013 keep them coming. Thanks to @DsGo @AntonBlank, @degrus who all suggested that what looked (to me) like the letters \"BONU\" written on the wall in Grant's school was much more likely to be \"BCNU\" (\"Be seeing you\") \u2013 could this be a little nod to The Prisoner? On the other hand, @AnthonyMarx found a company (BioNeutral Group Inc.) who might fit the bill if it is BONU. \u2022 Meanwhile eagle-eyed @IanBradley pointed out that: \"There's a creepy easter egg if you dial the police hotline number in the background when Grant's mother is making the appeal\" - another one of those details that's making Utopia so entertaining. \u2022 Is \"psycho pirate\" going to be one of the TV looks of 2013? The Walking Dead is back soon, with David Morrissey returning as \"The Governor\" - also in an \"ocularly challenged\" position. One more eye patch and it's a trend. \u2022 \"Grant \u2013 about my essay. It's late, we need to get it in.\" Alice's dedication to Dostoevsky is admirable. \u2022 \"She's attractive. In a skinny bitch, evil murderess kind of way.\" Becky sizes up the competition. \u2022 Crime and Punishment, Russian flu, and Arby's real name \u2013 a strong Russian element running through this week. Did anyone catch Arby's name? Pietrey? Piotr? \u2022 \"I'm a spy, it's sort of the point of what I do.\" Milner cuts through Ian's worries with a decisive \"never mind the specifics, let's get on with the story\" logic. \u2022 Anyone else think that the look on Jessica's face when Grant hugged her \u2013 straight up to the sky \u2013 was similar to her \"murder face\" when she killed The Tramp? And why did she kiss Ian? To try it out? Does she keep wandering off and keeping an eye on things from a distance just because she can't handle small talk? \u2022 There were some noteworthy moments with Becky looking at her supply of meds \u2013 reminiscent of the \"chems\" the spies take in The Bourne Legacy perhaps? Did the way she got upset after spilling the Fanta at the end of Ian's romantic \"madness, murder and mayhem\" speech suggest that the degenerative effects of Deels might be kicking in? \u2022 \"What \u2013 like a break up?\" Wilson Wilson seems genuinely distraught at the thought of the gang not sticking together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
