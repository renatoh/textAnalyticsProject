The patent application describes a system where an audio fingerprint embedded in TV shows or ads, inaudible to human ears, would trigger the phone, tablet or long-rumoured smart speaker to turn on the microphone and start recording \u201cambient audio of the content item\u201d. The recording could then be matched to a database of content to allow Facebook to identify what the individual was watching \u2013 like Shazam for TV, but without the individual choosing to activate the system. Diagrams accompanying the patent application highlight how the technology would know which adult or child within a household was watching a particular broadcast. The patent, first spotted by the New York Times, positions the technology as a way for broadcasters to know exactly who is watching their TV shows or ads and for how long. The same system could then be used to build viewing profiles of individual members of a household for better content recommendation and more targeted advertising. Privacy experts are concerned about the intrusion into people\u2019s homes, particularly as the ambient audio recording would likely catch snippets of people\u2019s private conversations without their knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disconcerting for privacy to have an inaudible beacon as it means they want to make it not obvious to the user that the device is listening,\u201d said William Budington, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Such a system could also give Facebook a better understanding of people\u2019s social connections as it would show the social network which people were meeting up in real life. Facebook was quick to downplay the patent filing. \u201cIt is common practice to file patents to prevent aggression from other companies. Because of this, patents tend to focus on future-looking technology that is often speculative in nature and could be commercialised by other companies,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s head of intellectual property, Allen Lo, in a statement. \u201cThe technology in this patent has not been included in any of our products, and never will be.\u201d Facebook isn\u2019t the first company to design a system that uses secretly broadcast audio signals to track people\u2019s viewing habits. In 2015, a company called SilverPush developed ultrasonic audio \u201cbeacons\u201d within TV commercials that could be identified by any device running apps that incorporated SilverPush\u2019s software. The system allows for far more accurate tracking of people\u2019s viewing habits at an individual level. In March 2016, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued warning letters to app developers who had installed the software encouraging them to notify people that their app could allow third parties to monitor their viewing habits. \u201cThese apps were capable of listening in the background and collecting information about consumers without notifying them,\u201d said Jessica Rich, the director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cCompanies should tell people what information is collected, how it is collected, and who it\u2019s shared with.\u201d Less than a week later, SilverPush announced it was killing the tracking software to move into \u201cnew areas of growth and profitability\u201d. The idea that Facebook already listens to people\u2019s conversations and uses that information to deliver targeted advertising has been a popular conspiracy theory for years. It appeared to originate in May 2014 when the company launched a feature called \u201cIdentify TV and Music\u201d, which listened to ambient noise when a user was writing a status update \u2013 with their permission. At the time the company had to assuage people\u2019s fears that the feature was always on, eavesdropping in the background. Despite denials, the rumour persisted and in October 2017 the company\u2019s head of advertising, Rob Godman, had to issue another denial in response to an investigation carried out by tech podcast Reply All. \u201cI run ads product at Facebook. We don\u2019t \u2013 and have never \u2013 used your microphone for ads. Just not true,\u201d Goldman tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
