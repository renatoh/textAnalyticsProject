They have made themselves hoarse on the hustings, but there are still three sweaty months to go. Yet they know they can only be a sideshow at this stage in the post-election cycle, when all eyes are on the coalition. It may be some consolation to the contenders to know they are doing their party some good as recruiting officers. At least 25,000 new members have joined up since Labour's election defeat, a mixture of returners and disaffected Lib Dems. When ballot papers go out to MPs, trade union supporters and activists on 1 September, newcomers' votes may have a disproportionate influence. In a crowded suite at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Sunday, the mood among grassroots members was cheerful and the five candidates were conspicuously civil to each other. With all four ex-cabinet blokes basically pro-European social democrats and Diane Abbott not resorting to ferocious denunciation from the left, none of the old Bevanite or Bennite venom was evident. That did not prevent bursts of applause for both fierce attacks on coalition perfidy and admissions \u2013 admittedly guarded \u2013 that the Blair-Brown governments got civil liberties, banking or Iraq wrong. The candidates face the classic dilemma of politicians running for party office. To enthuse activists who are in an \"oppose, oppose, oppose\" mood, they risk offending the wider electorate \u2013 whose votes they may need soon if the coalition collapses quickly and David Cameron seeks his own majority. Conventional wisdom says that a Miliband will emerge as leader. But which one? Frontrunner David, 44, has the gravitas, the biggest war chest, the inside track. Ed, 40, has a more engaging platform style, a greater willingness to tack left, a good record on climate issues. Both are picking up nominations, but David's greater willingness to defend the record \u2013 and his Blairite label \u2013 may damage him as candidates start campaigning among union executives. There is gossip (denied) that rather than risk coming last behind Abbott, Andy Burnham \u2013 campaigning as the scouser scourge of the \"London elite\" \u2013 may swing his support behind a rival. And Ed Balls? Along with Miliband senior, he struck some activists in Cardiff as a credible opposition leader, experienced, combative (too combative?) and articulate. Might the pair co-operate to block Miliband junior, some MPs wonder. \"There's a swing back towards David,\" say others. It is mere speculation. No game-changing Big Idea has yet emerged. There have been cautious differences and the contenders have done their separate best to hammer the Tories at the dispatch box. Surely they have something up their sleeves for ballot paper week? Whoever wins could provide a more collegiate style, more appropriate to coalition politics than the Tony-and-Gordon duopoly or Thatcher's hegemony. \"All of them would be useful in a shadow cabinet,\" observed one uncommitted voter, impressed but not overwhelmed by the hustings. In difficult times Labour is looking for a leader who will decide where it should be led."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
