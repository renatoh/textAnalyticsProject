The settlement of the long-running dispute with the FSA follows a series of court hearings involving Mr Davidson who began his quest to clear his name after receiving a record-breaking \u00a3750,000 fine by the City regulator for market abuse. The Financial Services and Markets Tribunal ruled in May that the FSA had not proved its case against Mr Davidson or trader Ashley Tatham in an investigation into the flotation of biotech company Cyprotex in 2002. The FSA had alleged that Mr Davidson placed a \u00a35m spread bet to facilitate the flotation of the company, in which he was a shareholder, through Mr Tatham. The tribunal later ruled that the pair should receive costs from the FSA - the first time that the City regulator had been ordered to pay the costs of people it had tried to penalise for breaching its rules. The FSA has agreed to pay Mr Tatham \u00a3700,000 and it is likely the sum to be received by Davidson will be the same. But the process of seeking costs had been complicated for Mr Davidson because he had been declared bankrupt and the trustees in bankruptcy had been laying claim to some of the costs he might receive. Mr Davidson, whose businesses were based in Macclesfield, was discharged from bankruptcy this year. He made his name from inventing a pipe which made it easier to paint behind radiators. The settlement appears to have been secured after the latest appearances in the high court by Mr Davidson who most recently had been applying to the courts to wind up the FSA because of their refusal to pay him the costs he was due. Last week a judge told him he risked getting a \"bloody nose\" if he persisted with his attempts and suggested that another court that deals specifically with costs would be a better place for the matter. However, a settlement has since been reached and will be an embarrassment for the FSA which has suffered a series of setbacks in regulatory actions. It has rejigged its rules to try to make the process fairer for those being investigated. The case has now cost the FSA \u00a31.4m in costs and an unquantified amount of time. The FSA confirmed that a settlement had been reached. \"We can confirm that we have settled all outstanding matters with Mr Davidson,\" a spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
