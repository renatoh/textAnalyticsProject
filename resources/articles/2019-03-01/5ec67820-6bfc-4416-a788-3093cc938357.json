Robb confirmed he had left Landbridge, which holds the lease over the Darwin port, late last year, after a health precinct project he had been working on was rejected by Beijing. Speaking to the ABC, Robb said he blamed his former parliamentary colleagues, particularly Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull, for souring relations between the two nations, and said Australia\u2019s security agencies needed to prove its claims China was a threat. Robb said the Landbridge CEO had been told \u201cin no uncertain terms by the senior officials that unfortunately the relationship between Australia and China had become so toxic that his [the health precinct proposal] would be put in the bin\u201d. \u201c\u2026 We had our deputy prime minister last year stand up in front of a Channel Nine TV camera and say \u2018I want all Australians to know that Isis is not a security threat, China is our security threat\u2019. That is irresponsible,\u201d Robb told the ABC. He also claimed Australia\u2019s security agencies needed to put up or shut up in their criticisms of China. \u201cThe evidence is not there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see a lot of nose-touching by the security people: \u2018If you only knew what I know, you\u2019d be horrified.\u2019 \u201cWell, tell us. Let us know. I was in the National Security Committee and I\u2019ve gotta say I didn\u2019t learn much more than I read in the papers.\u201d But Robb seemingly saved his most scathing assessment for Turnbull\u2019s actions in late 2017. During a particularly fraught period in Beijing-Canberra relations, which coincided with the Bennelong byelection, Turnbull delivered a quote, often, but perhaps wrongly, attributed to Chairman Mao at the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949, while defending Australia\u2019s introduction of foreign interference laws. \u201cModern China was founded in 1949 with these words: \u2018Zhongguo renmin zhanqilai\u2019 \u2013 the Chinese people have stood up\u2019,\u201d Turnbull told reporters in December 2017. \u201cIt was an assertion of sovereignty, it was an assertion of pride,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd so we say: \u2018Aodaliya renmin zhanqilai \u2013 the Australian people stand up.\u2019\u201d Robb said it was the final straw. \u201c\u2026 When the former prime minister [Turnbull] of Australia, in bringing in a register of people who are working for foreign companies, got up and in Mandarin said something, paraphrased that for Australia, as standing up for its freedom \u2026 they [China] were just gob-smacked and deeply offended.\u201d Robb\u2019s departure from parliament in 2016 and straight into a high-paying consulting gig with Landbridge, whose owner, Ye Cheng, has close ties with the ruling Chinese Communist party, raised concerns and calls for change. Robb had negotiated a free-trade agreement with Beijing while trade minister and was also vocal in support for the sale of the Darwin port, which ended with Landbridge winning a 99-year lease for the key trading stop, for $506m. In his interview with the ABC, Robb again defended taking the $880,000 consulting job with the Chinese company. \u201cI\u2019ve been pilloried and used and abused \u2026 [it\u2019s] been very helpful to try and sell some security measures and things, but I understood my responsibilities as much as anyone, more than most I think,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve never spent one minute doing work in Australia, notwithstanding what you read endlessly about this being treasonous and greedy and all the rest of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
