A four-metre-wide Banksy depicting MPs in the House of Commons as chimpanzees set a record for the artist when it sold for close to \u00a310m at Sotheby\u2019s in London after just 13 minutes of bidding. The \u00a39,879,500 winning bid was notable not just for its size but by how much it exceeded the pre-auction expectations of between \u00a31.5m and \u00a32m. It also, no doubt, prompted anyone who had bought an early Banksy to raise their eyebrows about what value the picture on their wall might now hold. But while an original Banksy is out of reach for all but the wealthy, is there money to be made from other street artists or up-and-coming painters? Has his success resulted in a knock-on effect that investors can take advantage of? \u201cBanksy can reduce complex subjects and debate into a simple, legible message, often with humour,\u201d says Alex Branczik of Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cBut he is also unique and has global appeal \u2013 not true of all street artists, or those who started in a similar way to Banksy. Anyone thinking they can find the next Banksy, or get ahead of the curve, is likely to get it wrong. \u201cIf you are going to spend some money on a piece of art, make sure it is something you love. It is much better to buy one thing you are going to enjoy seeing on your walls, rather than many different pieces you think will rise in value. There are no certainties in the art market \u2013 fashions come and go \u2013 but if you have an artwork you love, there is something greater there than its financial value.\u201d Art has always held a fascination for investors \u2013 the Knight Frank luxury investment index shows values have grown 146% over the past 10 years and 10% in the past 12 months. But urban artist Charles Uzzell-Edwards \u2013 otherwise known as \u201cPure Evil\u201d \u2013 warns potential investors to tread with caution and take time to understand the market. \u201cLooking at an artist is similar to picking out a racehorse. You\u2019ve got to study the form,\u201d he says. Uzzell-Edwards, who has a gallery in Shoreditch, east London, advises: \u201cIf there is a piece of art or an artist you like and you want to buy, see what shows they have done. How long have they been around? What prices have they sold for in the past? Visit galleries and speak to dealers. Be sure there is some longevity or a track record.\u201d Online dealer MyArtBroker sells original work, limited-edition prints and signed prints by contemporary artists such as Banksy, New York-based graffiti and street artist Kaws, Damien Hirst and Harland Miller, among others. Prices for signed prints start from around \u00a31,750 for a Hirst. Unsigned, certificated Banksy prints start from about \u00a37,500 but a signed print can be anything from \u00a315,000 upwards. Co-founder Ian Syer says there has been a big increase in demand, given the returns some investors and collectors have seen in the Banksy market. Interest doesn\u2019t just come from the typical banker or hedge fund manager looking for a status symbol for their City flat. \u201cSome of our largest clients are ordinary working people who have financed art portfolios through leveraging their property and remortgaging, or taking advantage of cheap finance \u2013 0% credit card deals for example,\u201d he says. But some street or urban artists\u2019 work peaked in value around 10 years ago. Syer explains: \u201cIn 2008 there was a big rush of money into this market, culminating in Bonhams\u2019 Urban Art auction shortly before the banking collapse. Many artists set records which are unlikely to be broken for some years. \u201cHowever, the artists or markets that recovered, such as Banksy, have really prospered. We would now class his work as \u2018blue chip\u2019, as it is being sold globally alongside Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Keith Haring.\u201d Investors, he says, should look at the secondary market for an artwork with a positive track record \u2013 perhaps it has been auctioned a few times and increased in value. \u201cEdition prints are a great way of getting into markets where original works are out of reach, and with online trading platforms it is very easy to buy and sell. \u201cBanksy\u2019s Girl with Balloon is a great example. A signed print was originally sold for \u00a3150 in around 2003-04 and has just auctioned for \u00a3200,000.\u201d For those with smaller amounts to invest, Syer suggests looking at work by Irish street artist Conor Harrington or an unsigned Banksy print. Be vigilant about fakes and get verification. Scams and frauds are common. In the case of Banksy, Pest Control is an authentication service set up by the artist in 2008 that can verify works for a fee. Buyers should also be aware of dealer or auction fees. Peter Gagliardi, head of Gagliardi Gallery in Chelsea, London, which sells original contemporary art, says even if an artwork rises in value, owners will lose 20% to 25% in fees when it is sold. \u201cIf you view your artwork as an investment, then factor in the commissions and fees,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much has the work got to increase in value before you have covered any fee when you come to sell?\u201d Gagliardi warns buyers that they need to be prepared for ups and downs in the market \u2013 an artist who is popular today may not necessarily stand the test of time. He adds: \u201cDamien Hirst was fashionable in the contemporary art market a few years ago. There was a big media push. But I would say that has peaked now and prices have been falling. \u201cAll the more reason to buy art you love: then it should not matter if it rises or falls in value.\u201d \u2018The return is in the pleasure it brings\u2019 Ian Hay is passionate about contemporary art: so much so he left his job as a pension administrator to set up the Saul Hay Gallery in Manchester with his wife, Catherine, to champion modern artists. He is especially proud of his personal collection, in particular an oil self-portrait by Canadian artist Andrew Salgado, pictured, which he bought for \u00a33,000 in 2012 at the London Art Fair. Salgado has become widely acclaimed and his larger paintings can sell for tens of thousands of pounds. \u201cI\u2019d been following Salgado\u2019s work for a while when I saw this piece \u2013 The Paradox. I liked it immediately. Its loose expressionism style appeals to me,\u201d says Hay, who is pleased to have spotted a young artist before he became a global success. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford an original Salgado now. I suppose that\u2019s a sign I made a good investment. \u201cBut, to my mind, the real return is in the pleasure a piece of art brings to you and I just love this painting.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
