It shifted more than 2.8 million copies in its first 24 hours of release compared to the 2.4 million copies sold in the same timeframe by the previous World of Warcraft expansion, The Burning Crusade. Impressive figures then \u2013 and with over 11 million active subscribers you can expect sales to continue \u2013 but let's face it, we fully expected it right? Anything less than Burning Crusade would have been an embarassment and developers Blizzard have such a rabid fanbase they could probably release a 2D platformer for the C64 next week and sell a million copies. But Lich King deserves the success, with the new landmass of Northrend frankly far too pretty for its own good. A week since release then, what do you think of Lich King so far?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
