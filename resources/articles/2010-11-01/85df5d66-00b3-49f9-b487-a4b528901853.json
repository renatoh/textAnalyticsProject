City's run of three successive defeats \u2013 against Arsenal, Wolves and Lech Poznan \u2013 has met with a sanguine reaction in Abu Dhabi where City's powerbrokers have their eyes on a bigger picture. With the team standing a respectable fourth in the Premier League and well placed for progression to the knock\u2011out phase of the Europa League, Mancini is still seen as the right man to bring glory to Eastlands. Such faith could be severely tested were the team to lose at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday and succumb to Manchester United at Eastlands on Wednesday. While an extended losing run would necessarily force a revision of opinion, the present thinking in Abu Dhabi is that talk of a crisis is largely tabloid fuelled, while persistent rumours about serious dressing room unrest are exaggerated. Dissent is restricted to a handful of players with a couple of agents looking to destabilise matters by whipping up lurid stories of near mutiny. It is also hoped that the expected return of Carlos Tevez, City's captain and principal striker, at West Brom will galvanise the side. The recently injured Tevez has returned from addressing personal problems and homesickness in his native Argentina and was welcomed back when he returned to the club's Carrington training complex yesterday afternoon. \"It's nice news for us that Carlos is back,\" said his compatriot Pablo Zabaleta, the City full\u2011back or midfielder. \"He is so important for us. When Carlos plays we have many more options and he can win games for us. We have other important players here as well, but he's great for us. We've missed him. When he's out of the team it's not the same.\" Zabaleta was anxious to endorse Mancini's managerial modus operandi. \"Yes, of course we are backing the manager. We are all on the same side here. We want to be a great team. If we can just win a game we'll get some confidence again and that will be really important for us. Getting a win at West Brom is vital. \"Three defeats in a row are not good because you lose confidence but we have to be positive and try to win to get our confidence back. We need to try and refocus and believe in ourselves. You look at the squad and we have fantastic players. But the players, staff, everybody has to know that we need to change something. We have to change our mindset for West Brom and get back to winning.\" If Zabaleta was very much on message David Platt's backing for Mancini remains unequivocal. \"All the negativity is external, not internal,\" said the former England midfielder, now a key member of City's coaching staff. \"We are in a very good position in the Europa League, we're sat three points behind Manchester United and Arsenal in the League and we've got a squad full of very, very good players. \"People from the outside may look in and say everything is falling in around us but it isn't, I assure you. We've got great players and they know they are very good players. When they come into training, they'll have a look round that dressing room and they'll know that they are confident in each other and the manager. There is no panic. The players are absolutely positive. They're confident. There's nothing we see which is a big issue.\" At present Platt's views are shared in the Arabian Gulf but, without an upturn in results, a reluctant reappraisal could be soon be underway \u2013 and possibly as early as this time next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
