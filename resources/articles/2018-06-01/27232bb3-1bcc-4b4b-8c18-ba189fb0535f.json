A total of 3,652 patients suffered an injury through being restrained during 2016-17 \u2013 the highest number ever \u2013 according to data from 48 of England\u2019s 56 mental health trusts. The figures raise serious questions about the effectiveness of the government\u2019s drive to reduce use of techniques which critics say can be traumatic for patients and even endanger their lives. \u201cWhilst this dramatic increase may be partly explained by improved reporting, the scale of injuries is horrifying. This is also, no doubt, in part due to the stress that many trusts are under, with bed occupancy close to 100% and often relying on agency staff,\u201d said Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb. He was the health minister in the coalition government which in 2014 ordered NHS mental health trusts to reduce their use of restraint. \u201cThis amounts to a serious and unacceptable breach of people\u2019s human rights,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is most shocking is that some of those against whom restraint is used have suffered abuse in their lives. For them, restraint amounts to an assault, which can be frightening and can completely undermine trust.\u201d The trusts where the largest number of injuries occurred were Southern Health (534 incidents), Merseycare (493) and South London and the Maudsley (255). The NHS does not publish annual figures for the number of patients injured due to restraint. But these new statistics are much higher than any previous studies. For example, a survey Lamb undertook last year found that 554 injuries to patients occurred at 22 trusts. Overall, restraint was used 97,000 times in 2016-17, although some trusts have hugely reduced the number of times they deploy such techniques. Around 2,600 staff were also injured during the use of restraint, with the Greater Manchester trust recording the highest number \u2013 276. Alison Cobb, a senior policy and campaigns officer at Mind, the mental health charity, said the increase was \u201calarming\u201d. \u201cPhysical restraint can be humiliating, terrifying and even life-threatening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should only be used as the last resort, when there is no other way of de-escalating a situation where someone may harm themselves or others.\u201d The Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI), which obtained the figures under Freedom of Information laws, also found that 13% of trusts do not have any restraint policy in place, even though government guidance in 2014 said all providers of mental health care should draw one up. Martyn Dadds, the CPI\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWorrying levels of restraint are still taking place, with resulting injuries, despite years of government recommendations designed to reduce these practices. It\u2019s critical that staff are properly trained and that NHS trusts have adequate policies in place to ensure that the most vulnerable members of society, as well as staff, are protected.\u201d Statutory guidance is needed to improve both standards of training, especially in de-escalation techniques, and the recording of the use of restraint, Dadds added. The figures come just before Croydon North Labour MP Steve Reed\u2019s mental health units (use of force) bill, which aims to reduce use of restraint, returns to the Commons on Friday. It was inspired by the death of his 23-year-old constituent Olaseni Lewis, who died after being restrained at the Bethlem Royal mental health hospital in Kent in 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
