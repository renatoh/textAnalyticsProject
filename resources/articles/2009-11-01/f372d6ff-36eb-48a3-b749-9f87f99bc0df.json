After months of agonising, the Obama administration yesterday opted to transfer five of the Guant\u00e1namo detainees, including the self-confessed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to the US mainland. The decision is part of Barack Obama's promise to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay by January, with the 200-plus detainees either tried or released, a timetable that he is now unlikely to meet. Many of the cases are still under review. But the trial on Manhattan is an extremely risky move. There are security problems: it will raise fears in New York that such a high-profile case will make the city a renewed target for terrorist attack. There are legal problems: it will also be difficult to prosecute, given that much of the evidence will have been tainted by the waterboarding of Mohammed under the Bush administration, a practice Obama has already labelled torture. And there are political problems: the fallout for the Obama administration if the court was to release them. Republicans yesterday condemned the decision, both because the alleged plotters might be released but also because of the potential danger to New Yorkers. Jon Kyl, the Republican Senate whip, said: \"It is an unnecessary risk to bring the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks to downtown Manhattan.\" The House judiciary committee ranking member Lamar Smith said: \"The Obama administration's decision to bring the 9/11 conspirators to the US to stand trial could endanger the American people \u2026 bringing terrorists to US soil expands their constitutional rights and could result in shorter sentences.\" Announcing the decision yesterday at the justice department in Washington, the attorney general, Eric Holder, said he was confident there would be a successful prosecution. \"Today we announce a step forward in bringing those we believe were responsible for the 9/11 attacks and the attack on the USS Cole to justice.\" Asked about holding the trial in New York, Holder said that this was what typically happened in crimes in the US, returning them to the scene of the crime. The Obama administration decision to opt for a civilian court contrasts with George Bush's reluctance to take the chance of putting them on trial on the US mainland, where they will be subject to the same laws as everyone else, rather than opting for military commissions at Guant\u00e1namo. Holder stressed this yesterday: \"For over 200 years our nation has relied upon a faithful adherence to the rule of law.\" That confidence in the rule of law has its limitations. Holder announced that five others, including Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, will be tried for the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, where 17 sailors were killed, in military commission in Guant\u00e1namo, albeit with revised rules. The New York trial in federal court in the southern district will see the appearance of Mohammed, Walid Bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi, all charged with conspiracy to carry out the 9/11 attacks. Under existing law they cannot be transferred from Guant\u00e1namo for at least another 44 days. They will then be put into a federal prison in New York. Holder, answering concerns about the security risks of their presence, said New York had successfully, and without incident, been the location for other terrorist-related cases over the last two decades. Although New York has banned the death penalty, Holder said he would be asking for the death penalty in this case, because it was a federal crime. Addressing concerns about a fair trial, given the use of torture, he said he would not have ordered the trial unless he was confident of a prosecution and hinted that there was evidence that could be presented other than had been obtained by waterboarding or other techniques. In danger of being overlooked yesterday was the resignation of the White House counsel, Greg Craig, one of the highest-profile casualties of the Obama administration. Craig had responsibility for ensuring the administration met the president's promise to close Guant\u00e1namo by 22 January but that timetable has slipped badly. Of those left at Guant\u00e1namo, roughly 40 could be put on trial in the federal courts or military commissions, with the remainder released. That would leave about 70 who cannot be put on trial because of insufficient evidence but who are viewed as too dangerous to release. The families of 9/11 victims were divided in their reaction to the decision to try the accused plotters in New York. \"We are very pleased that this trial is going to take place in New York and finally Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be brought to justice,\" said Donna Marsh O'Connor, whose daughter Vanessa Langer was killed in the World Trade Centre attack. \"We are under no illusions about this man. But we believe that Guant\u00e1namo Bay is a blight on America \u2026 we're trying them here because we have a justice system that is set up to handle the worst of the worst.\" But Peter Gadiel, whose son James died in the attacks, criticised the decision and said the accused plotters should be tried in military commissions. \"I've been wondering what side this man Obama is on and I guess it's not our side,\" he said. Legal opinion: Torture may rule out much evidence This is very significant and very welcome. It marks a sharp move away from the so called war on terror \u2013 a term Obama does not use - and more importantly it appears to signal the beginning of the end of the military commissions set up by President Bush. We have been told that these men are the \"worst of the worst\", so if they can be sent for trial in civil courts it is difficult to see how any cogent argument could be made in future for sending other suspects to face military commissions. It is therefore a return to the notion that we treat suspected international terrorists on a crime footing, rather than a war footing. There remain, however, serious questions about what evidence the prosecution will rely on. At least one of these men \u2013 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \u2013 has been waterboarded, which is a form of torture, and therefore anyevidence gained as a result is inadmissible. It is significant that Mohammed al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker - is not going to be one of those who are going to stand trial. In January this year, Susan Crawford, the official in charge of deciding whether to bring Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees to trial, said he had been tortured and therefore could not face prosecution. This will surely have some bearing on this trial and what evidence the prosecution will beallowed to use. But this is a very important and welcome step. President Obama gave a cast iron pledge that he would shut Guantanamo Bay within and this is a significant step in that direction.
