Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes one and two of the second season \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please do not leave spoilers. Catch up with Vicky Frost's season one finale blog 86,000 Children; In Brussels No One Can Hear You Scream Hello and welcome to this second series of Borgen and our episode-by-episode blog. I'll be attempting to guide you round the corridors of power \u2013 and indeed the perplexing floorplan of Birgitte Nyborg's home \u2013 during these dark January evenings, despite my admittedly flaky grasp of Danish coalition politics. Although given that the Moderates themselves seem to be back-pedaling on promises at some pace, I'm sure it's not just me who is unclear how far to the left they really sit. Still, as I was reminded several times in these opening episodes, there are two things our favourite statsminister can always rely on: an amazing blow-dry and a sharp blazer. And Nyborg couldn't rely on much else in this opening double bill: we saw the prime minister struggling to marshal her party, her allies, the coalition as a whole, even her own, once rock-solid, beliefs about the role Denmark should be playing in Afghanistan. There was no gentle introduction for those who needed a first series refresher: we hit the ground running and barely paused for breath. Within moments I'd fallen once more for Nyborg, and Sidse Babett Knudsen's brilliant portrayal of her. It's a performance so central to this show: after a year off-screen, it made me swoon all over again. The politicians Did Birgitte have her mind changed on Afghanistan by first the NGO and then the army? Or was she manoeuvred into an about-turn by a cunning Hesselboe who left her with little wriggle room? Or, indeed, a mixture of both? Despite opening in Afghanistan \u2013 which fans of The Killing will recognise as dangerous territory indeed for a BBC4 Danish drama \u2013 we fast found ourselves back in Denmark with Birgitte under pressure from all sides: to withdraw troops; to maintain troops; to increase troops and weapons. In some ways I'm not sure this was necessarily the strongest opening episode \u2013 I felt at times it was a bit transparent in presenting arguments on the one hand and then the other \u2013 but I loved the hunt for a new EU commissioner that followed it. On paper it looked less than entirely thrilling \u2013 as even Laugesen noted: \"No one wants to read about the EU. It's too complicated and unsexy\" \u2013 but it proved to be completely gripping as everyone, bar dear old Bent, plotted madly to gain the most personal advantage. How Birgitte hadn't realised that Jacob Kruse was not quite the loyal protege she might have hoped for, I'm not sure: he was so slimy he almost came labelled with a sign saying \"baddie\". (In fact he reminded me of Angus McCain from The Hour, what with his retro spectacles and everything.) But then when you spend your whole time wheeling and dealing and being undermined at every turn, I imagine you grab at any support you can. And Nyborg does seem extremely short of properly loyal allies \u2013 Kasper excepted. That's perhaps not entirely surprising, given how hardnosed the statsminister has to be at times: as she stomped around, black trenchcoat billowing, flanked by Niels Erik and Kasper, the trio looked as if they were about to unleash their superhuman powers rather than simply send Kruse to Brussels with a massive salary (2.5m DKK is more than \u00a3270,000). That final scene as Birgitte slowly revealed her hand: that she knew Kruse hadn't passed on the message about Bent's illness; that he'd briefed Express against her, was sublime. The thing about Nyborg is she can entirely ruin your career while still doing her special crinkly-nosed smile. It's a killer combination. The newsroom Not TV1's tiny staff, but Express's almost equally teeny operation this time round, with Katrine being as brilliant and frustrating as ever: fantastic at getting the story, apparently incapable of realising that bosses can be annoying. Pushing Hanne and Katrine together is a clever piece of plotting: not only do they both sport a boggling array of scarves, they also make a quite formidable reporting duo \u2013 or they do when Hanne isn't drunk. Personally I wondered if the political editor's booze problem wasn't a little overdone in the second episode, but it does make the dynamic between Hanne and Katrine interesting, presenting them as equals who need each others' support rather than an older woman and her student. Borgen's great strength is in not oversimplifying questions of gender and feminism: I have faith that the Hanne/Katrine relationship is not going to become entirely about whether ambitious women really can \"have it all\", or whether family must be inevitably sacrificed for success. It's a question to tackle, certainly \u2013 but I also like the idea of examining a friendship that crosses generations, and sees women supporting and passing knowledge to each other. (Nyborg, we may remember from season one, managed to actually get rid of plenty of female colleagues, albeit not by design.) Personal lives In much the same way, I really enjoyed the examination of Bent and Birgitte's friendship across these episodes: an unlikely but important relationship between people who had politically drifted, but remained at heart important to each other. I intially found myself missing the Birgitte/Philip storyline that had really driven the first series: I know we popped in on them as Birgitte struggled to sign the divorce papers, but it felt that was more to do with a woman juggling and fighting on all fronts than personal dynamic. (That embrace as Philip told her she would have to find the strength to do the thing she was dreading was beautifully done, however. It took you straight back to the powerful ties that had initially seemed to bind them.) Bent's pleading question to Birgitte: \"When did we stop being friends?\" and the pair's shouted: \"Is the job mine?\" \"Yes. Congratulations\" were heart-stopping. We often see the end of romatic relationships played out on screen; struggling friendships dissolving into bad temper are shown far less often. This was surprising and thought-provoking stuff, not least because the script seemed happy to lay the blame squarely with our heroine. Meanwhile, back with Kasper and Katrine \u2026 Hanne is clearly right when she tells the spin doctor that he is still in love with Katrine. And yet Kasper has also managed to bag himself a beautiful, apparently loaded girlfriend who seems very understanding about both his ex and his job. Lotte could be brilliant for Kasper, but somehow I doubt she'll get the treatment she deserves. Trust is everything, she tells him \u2013 as ominous clouds gather. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Many of us wondered at Katrine's tiny flat last series. Tonight she also referenced her student digs and Laugesen provided her salary: 60,000 DKK a month plus pension and free lunch. (What a perk!) That's around \u00a378k a year. Maybe she's saving up for a deposit \u2013 or that espresso machine was really, really expensive \u2026 \u2022 Repeat Danish actor of the night: bereaved dad Jorgen Hedegard was played by the prime minister from Forbrydelsen III. \u2022 The Nyborg Christensen households finally have some domestic help. I imagine we're going to see a great deal more of the kids this series, but it looks as if Philip and Birgitte are going to try and behave amicably. \u2022 Come back Sanne! Jytte has had a sense of humour bypass. Thankfully lovely Bent was on hand to avoid Magnus being bored to death by coasters. \u2022 Danish design lust: Birgitte's office coffee set is particularly covetable. Hanne's cape is very much on my want list. \u2022 I liked how cross-platform Katrine was being: filing video and audio from Afghanistan. Odd then that when it came to her copy, she handed in a physical piece of paper. \u2022 Translation of the night: \"I've worked my arse off\" \u2013 Kruse. \u2022 Slightly odd translation of the night: \"I don't need a crown prince, I'm not an old queen\" \u2013 Nyborg. \u2022 I'm not sure I think the prime minister's spokesman would be allowed to just wander round a newspaper office, even if he did come bearing gifts. \u2022 Talking of which \u2026 Amazing birthday present from Hanne for Katrine \u2013 a piece of the Berlin wall! I'm less sure, however, about Kasper's presentation of the fertility symbol Venus of Willendorf \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
