The 25-year-old Bulgarian needed only one win from his weekend bouts to claim the title. He jump-started Mongolian opponent Ama from the face-off and crashed into the sekiwake's chest, getting both arms wrapped around his mawashi [belt] to bulldoze him over to the side of the ring. Kotooshu then tackled him from behind, throwing himself on top of his opponent, who went smashing down to the dirt surface at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan arena. The victory lifted Kotooshu, real name Kaloyan Mahlyanov, to a 13-1 record, claiming the title with a bout to spare. It was the first tournament win in a six-year career for the 6ft 7in Bulgarian, who switched to sumo having been an accomplished Greco-Roman wrestler in his homeland. 'I'm too overwhelmed to say anything,' said a beaming Kotooshu. 'I'm so happy. I finally did it.' Kotooshu entered the tournament with the modest goal of getting more wins than losses to maintain his ozeki rank. But he conquered both grand champions, Hakuho and Asashoryu, and matched his previous best winning streak of 12 bouts. Overall, Kotooshu is the seventh foreign wrestler to win a tournament title, after retired Hawaiian grand champions Akebono and Musashimaru, as well as Mongolian yokozuna Asashoryu and Hakuho."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
