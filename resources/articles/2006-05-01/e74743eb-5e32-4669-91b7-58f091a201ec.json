If the UAR does not reach a settlement with its players, the RFU will consider suggesting next November's international against Argentina be cancelled, a move which would save the UAR a potential six-figure sum in flights and match fees. That would allow England to take on the All Blacks and celebrate the reopening of the south stand at Twickenham with a full complement of players. The long-form agreement between Premier Rugby and the RFU obliges clubs to release their players only for three Tests in the autumn and England are due to play Argentina and South Africa, twice, this November. The Pumas are hosting Wales for two Tests next month before taking on the All Blacks in Buenos Aires but 59 players yesterday went on strike in protest not just at their union's decision to withhold match fees and expenses after losing a court case brought by a young player who became a quadriplegic after playing in a domestic match, but at the failure in their eyes of the UAR to embrace professionalism. The players were due to meet UAR officials last night. The UAR needs next month's Tests to proceed to raise desperately needed funds, with the international against New Zealand expected to attract a sell-out 50,000 crowd, but the players say they have no confidence in their union. Most of the Pumas earn their living in Europe and would have to pay their own way home to play against Wales and the All Blacks. \"The union's position as an institution has been put in severe jeopardy, along with the game in Argentina itself,\" said the UAR president Alejandro Risler, \"but we hope to find a resolution to allow next month's internationals to go ahead.\" The Wales centre Gavin Henson, who last week pulled out of the tour to Argentina over concerns about his physical condition, has been told by his national coach Gareth Jenkins to put on weight and do sprint training in the close season. Mike Catt has been voted the Premiership's player of the season, with Sale's Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 named best director of rugby. Tom Varndell of Leicester was named as young player of the season and Bath's Isaac Feau'nati picked up try of the season for his effort against Bristol.
