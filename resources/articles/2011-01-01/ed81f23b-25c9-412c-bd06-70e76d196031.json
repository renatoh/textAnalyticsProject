The Fifa president made his views known days after G\u00fcnter Hirsch, an ethics committee official, resigned saying football's governing body had \"no real interest in playing an active role in the resolution, pursuance and prevention of violations of its ethics code\". Blatter said he was not happy with Hirsch's parting shot. He said the German lawyer had an opportunity to put forward suggestions while at Fifa but passed up the chance. \"He was there at the beginning of the ethics committee, he was not attending other meetings of the ethics committee, he was not making any comments on the ethic code,\" Blatter told CNN. \"He was asked to make comments in writing. He has not participated in the meetings we have had in connection with the 2010 voting process, so how [can] such a high-level legalist make such [a] declaration?\" Blatter gave short shrift to a recent survey in which 89% of respondents felt Fifa ought to change its voting system. \"Then this 90% of people, some of them should give us a proposal of how to do it better,\" he said. He resisted calls to change the system, under which Fifa's executive committee decides on the destination of the World Cup, by opening it up to member associations. \"It was the same [Fifa] congress that a few years ago, or many years ago, have decided we don't want to do it because it is too much responsibility, too high a responsibility for us.\" He said there were no plans for an anti-corruption unit but he does want to set up a body to help people believe in Fifa again and \"give some credibility\" to the governing body. \"I want to put together a sort of compliance group. People from outside of Fifa but being involved in politics, in culture, in economy, whatever, also in sport.\" Allegations of corruption in the organisation were wide of the mark, according to the 74-year-old. \"We have 300 million active participants in the Fifa. Three hundred million.Football players, coaches, referees, members. And if out of them in the process there are two, three or four and they are alleged \u2013 alleged \u2013 corruption activities, then you cannot say that everything is corrupt in Fifa; it's not possible.\" Blatter did concede there were structural problems with the body's executive committee. \"The government of Fifa, which is the executive committee, is not elected by the same entity that the president of Fifa is elected [by] \u2013 that's a problem. \"I am the only one elected by the congress and all the other members are elected by their confederations and that's why it is so difficult to manage my ministers. Really, it is difficult.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
