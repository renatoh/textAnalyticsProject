The rhetorical plainness of Hemingway, powerfully reformulated by Raymond Carver, is still the dominant style, but this overwrought complementary strain, with its biblical echoes and stubborn excesses, refuses to die. Some readers will always enjoy the sensation of an author's hot breath against their necks. Faulkner's education was patchy, but he was determined to show that Joe No-College could match Joe College phrase for phrase. Gay has taken over his trademark vocabulary: 'myriad', 'depthless' and 'atavistic' all put in appearances. He has a preference for negative formulations - 'undimensioned', 'unfeatured', 'patternless', for 'the dark unmetered poetry of the woods'. 'Revenant' is so much of a pet word that it is made to whelp an adjective: revenantial. Faulkner mocked Hemingway for being afraid to use words that might send readers to their dictionaries, while himself ignoring dictionary meanings. Gay's use of 'enormity', 'defray' and 'spectra' (used as a singular) is at odds with lexicography, but even when he seems to be making a word up - is 'anomolaec' on page 10 any more than a customised 'anomolous'? - it's hard not to be impressed by his conviction. The period is 1952, evoked with loving attention and only the occasional slip: 'a Goddamned bootlegger with a lifestyle a hop, skip and a jump from the federal penitentiary.' 'Lifestyle' was neither a word nor an idea in 1952. The setting is mostly the settlement of Ackerman's Field in Tennessee, home of three generations of Bloodworths, though as the men of the clan set off on fateful quests, or simply give in to congenital restlessness, the action follows them as far as Arkansas and Michigan. The hero, Fleming Bloodworth, is a young man who wants to be a writer. He broods a lot, as is only proper, particularly when he's left on his own by his father Boyd's setting off to Detroit in search of his runaway wife, with plans to kill the man she went with. Then his grandfather, E.F. Bloodworth, returns after a 20-year sojourn in Little Rock. Perhaps he means to make peace with his estranged wife and sons, but not all of them are in the mood for it. He settles in a trailer some way from the family house and spends more time with Fleming than with closer kin. He brings with him four blues records that he cut in the Twenties but has never heard, not having a gramophone. Gay's descriptive powers are fine, though his resort to a lofty register does not vary. Each day has apocalyptic rumblings, so that the fissures in sun-baked earth are like 'the embryonic beginnings of some ultimate cataclysm', while the interior of a car in a snow storm becomes 'the world's last outpost, these two the last two survivors'. These high-flown comparisons are from young Fleming's part of the story, but it isn't just the callow young man drunk on words who brings out the magniloquence in this writer. Otherwise the only element that contests the general grandeur is the salty sardonic talk of old men. It's easy to see how a youngster might be overawed by a grandfather who has been a bootlegger, served time, and plays the banjo, but the narrative seems to idealise him no less, this 'doomed reprobate patriarch whose lineage had gone strange and violent'. E.F. has had a stroke, but it's as if Gay can't allow any but a token diminution of the old man's vitality. The old timer's hair is still 'black as a crow's wing'. When it comes to making his way through woods in a blizzard, he's still got what it takes. This is a man's man's book of a darkly fancy sort, and the women in it are sexy ciphers. Cormac McCarthy has taken Faulkner's preoccupations to the South-West, even as far Mexico, where a different strain of fatalism lies in wait. William Gay's relocation is more modest and he has left out of the mixture most of what makes Faulkner fascinating - the roughness and tension. In Yoknapatawpha County, there is something else missing from Gay's Tennessee, Arkansas and Michigan: a non-white population. Old E.F. Bloodworth's blues 78s were classified as race records, a mistake which he takes in good part. Easier to be broadminded about such confusions when black culture exists without the distraction of black people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
