Since then albums Push the Button and We Are the Night have produced the mighty Galvanize, featuring Q-Tip, and last year's Saturate, which proved they are still the masters of instrumental mutant dance. The duo once said they made \"accidental pop records\" and they have certainly hurled some strange music at the charts. Star Guitar is quite overwhelming, designed to flush the heart and mind, Hey Boy, Hey Girl is still quite demented as is the ululating siren in Block Rockin' Beats. There's a bonus disc that rounds up their Electronic Battle Weapons - their numbered 12-inch only club tunes. Head to the sinister No 7, which combines a zinging acid line with an ominous voice booming, \"You are all my children now!\" Nobody does it better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
