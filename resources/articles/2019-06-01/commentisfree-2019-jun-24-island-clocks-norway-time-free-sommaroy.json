It won\u2019t stand the test of time", "bodyText": "Philosophers and physicists have long debated the reality of time. But it has taken the people of the Norwegian island of Sommar\u00f8y (population: 350) to reach a final verdict. They have sided with Douglas Adams, who declared \u201cTime is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.\u201d They want to declare their island a time-free zone. By coincidence, the story broke when I was in Skjolden, Norway, where the solstice sun set at 11.15pm and it never got fully dark. I\u2019m now en route to Kiruna, within the Arctic Circle, where, like Sommar\u00f8y, the midnight sun can be seen from May to July. The absence of a proper dawn and dusk shifts your perception of time. I\u2019m used to the move from light to dark to light punctuating the day and setting its reference points. The level of light tells you whether it\u2019s too early to have dinner, go to bed or get up. Without these signals I am more inclined to eat and sleep when I feel like it. Days and seasons have their natural rhythms, which may be slower and gentler near the poles but are never completely absent. The desire to erase them seems like a wishful overreaction to the strict timekeeping of modern life and the discipline that follows from it. For all its drawbacks, precise timing has been tremendously enabling. Almost all social coordination in the modern world requires formalised time. For example, the logistics required to assemble and audience and performers for any kind of concert or stage play involves any number of time points. You can\u2019t even flee to Sommar\u00f8y to escape the so-called tyranny of time without careful travel plans that rely on schedules and timetables. Hermits have no need of clocks. But living in a large modern community requires following a common timeframe. The romanticism of the time-free zone misses formal time\u2019s social aspect. Throwing away your watch might look like an opt-out from the capitalist machine, but it actually speaks to the central value fuelling consumerism: the desire for ever more personal choice and freedom. This is the main selling point of the Sommar\u00f8y plan. \u201cIf you want to paint your house at 2am, it\u2019s OK,\u201d says the leader of the campaign, Kjell Ove Hveding, on the campaign\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIf we want to take a swim at 4am, we will.\u201d Far from being a rejection of the values of modern life, it\u2019s an extension of the culture in which we expect to be able to do whatever we want when we want, at the click of an app. The promise of \u201cliberation\u201d from the clock panders to the illusion that total freedom is possible. Time-free Sommar\u00f8y is a consumerist phenomenon in another way. As the eye-watering prices around me testify, the market for tourists here is constituted by the so-called \u201ccash rich and time poor\u201d. Like luxury yoga retreats and spa weekends, the escape from time taps into the market for costly \u201cwellbeing\u201d breaks, where people spend huge amounts on what they convince themselves is spiritual care of the self. Hveding may be right to say: \u201cAll over the world, people are characterised by stress and depression.\u201d But many of the most time-poor are among the most cash-poor, working in multiple jobs while trying to raise families. If we\u2019re really worried about the tyranny of time, we should try to give more of it to them rather than swan off for indulgent holidays. The Sommar\u00f8y time-free zone is great publicity but completely impractical. However, it could be taken as a valuable provocation in an age when the dictatorship of the chronograph is acutely felt. For all the advantages of a common clock, the desire to escape it reflects a widespread perception that it has become less and less of an enabler and more and more of a slave master. The same complaint was made when clocking in at work became the norm. What has changed is how much we now bring the strict discipline of the clock upon ourselves. In the age of the \u201cquantified self\u201d we willingly time how long we sleep, exercise, look at screens. We are no longer hapless subjects of time and motion studies by managers but have internalised their logic into the self-management of our lives. It is not the ticking of the clock that we need to resist but the temptation to use it to measure all our activities. Time should be kept in its social place. Your watch (or more likely your phone) is for coordinating your life with others. You only become a slave to time if you choose to use time\u2019s whip to beat yourself. \u2022 Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
