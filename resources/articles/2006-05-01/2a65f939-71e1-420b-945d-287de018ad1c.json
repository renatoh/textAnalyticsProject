The ruling was 'an abuse of common sense,' said the Prime Minister. Such decisions, said the leader of the opposition, 'fly in the face of common sense'. Both men blame the 1998 Human Rights Act, which enshrined in UK law the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and provided the hijackers with the legal basis for their claim to avoid deportation. The hijackers' convictions were deemed 'unsafe' and overturned in 2003. A year later, their asylum claim - that they faced mortal danger from vengeful Taliban forces - was upheld. In the eyes of the law, these men were free, so the High Court found that the government had no right summarily to remove them. The Home Secretary said the decision was 'inexplicable'. He is wrong. It can be explained: the original prosecution was botched and the government disregarded due process in its haste to bundle the men out of the country. The outcome may not look like common sense at first sight but, on close inspection, it looks like justice. It was the right decision, even without taking into account the strong moral argument that Britain should never deport anyone to probable death. As we report today, Tony Blair now wants new legislation to limit the power of courts to interpret the Human Rights Act when that means overruling government. It is not surprising that the Prime Minister regrets yoking himself to judicial restraint eight years ago. His frustration with due process and preference for swift action based on gut instinct are well documented. Nor is it surprising that David Cameron should revive Michael Howard's 2005 manifesto pledge to 'reform, or failing that, scrap' the act. He wrote it. But this hostility to the Human Rights Act rests on the myth that it empowers criminals at the expense of law-abiding citizens; in fact, it protects citizens from abuse by the state. The European Convention is a well-crafted document, deftly balancing individual rights with the duty of government to protect the realm. It guarantees basic freedoms that every democratic politician should recognise, alongside sensible caveats to the effect that proven lawbreakers forfeit their rights. It says clearly that some freedoms are suspended in the event of 'lawful detention after conviction by a competent court'. Governments can override individual rights if 'necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety'. In other words, there is nothing in Britain's human rights legislation that says convicted hijackers cannot be deported, or that freedom of expression means prisoners must be allowed pornography in their cells, or that travellers are allowed to settle on green-belt land, or any other such strange consequences of the law's implementation that some have lamented in recent years. If government agencies are losing cases brought under the Human Rights Act - and getting results that defy 'common sense' - it is because they are failing to argue effectively in court. They need new lawyers, not new laws. The release of the Afghan hijackers does raise interesting questions about what happens when cases that have a high media profile do not yield the outcomes that politicians would prefer, for opaque legal reaons. But public distaste at the idea that someone who looks guilty be allowed to walk free should not distract us from the principle that free men cannot be arbitrarily expelled from the country. Attention to correct court procedure has protected many innocent people from being jailed and rescued a number of those wrongfully imprisoned. The decision to put the convention on to the the statute book should be recognised as a great liberal reform; instead, it has been misrepresented by politicians in their haste to appear tough on crime and, in the case of the Conservative party, to reject anything that looks like European interference in British sovereignty. It is telling that the Sun, which is running a campaign on the issue, denounced 'the EU Human Rights Act'. That is a basic factual error. The European Union had no part in creating the convention and has no role in enforcing it. It was drawn up by the Council of Europe, an institution set up after the Second World War in response to the twin horrors of Nazism and Stalinism. Its founding father was Winston Churchill. Its founding treaty was signed in London. It is easy to see why Tony Blair is frustrated with the Human Rights Act. It checks his authoritarian urges and, in the ruling on the Afghan hijackers, has exposed incompetence by his government. But if David Cameron claims to belong to the tradition of Tory liberalism, common sense might dictate that he defend a reform that requires the state to respect individual freedom and the rule of law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
