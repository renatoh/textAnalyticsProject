The move had immediate consequences for Silicon Valley companies that do business with Huawei, which is the second-largest smartphone maker in the world after Samsung and ahead of Apple. Google blocked Huawei\u2019s access to updates of the Android operating system and other US chipmakers cut off supplies to the company. More than 6,000 Blind users responded to the question, \u201cDo you predict that there will be negative consequences for people who are connected to China/perceived to be Chinese due to the growing tensions of the US-China trade war and concerns over Huawei?\u201d Respondents were also asked if they were Chinese citizens, Chinese Americans, or of other East Asian ethnicities. The survey is not a scientific poll, but it does provide some insight into sentiments among tech workers who use the app to discuss workplace issues with anonymity. Nearly two-thirds of respondents working for hardware or semiconductor firms responded \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s already happening\u201d. Employees of the chipmaker Qualcomm were the most concerned, with 20% saying individuals of Chinese descent were already facing negative consequences, and 56% predicting problems. Employees of Nvidia and Apple also had especially high rates of concern, followed by Google, Intel and Uber. Slightly less than half (48.4%) of respondents working for software and internet companies either predicted problems or said they were already happening. Across all industries, Chinese nationals had the highest rates of concern (66.7%), while Chinese Americans and those of other East Asian ethnicities (approximately 48%) were slightly more concerned than those who said they were not Chinese or East Asian (43%). \u201cAsian Americans have always been haunted by the specter of dual loyalty, and it\u2019s not just in our heads,\u201d said Frank Wu, a University of California Hastings law professor and the author of Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White. \u201cThe best example is the internment of Japanese Americans in world war II. Two-thirds of those interned were native born \u2026 Every time there is tension between any Asian country and America, Asian Americans face problems, even if they\u2019re not of that particular ethnicity.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s action against Huawei came amid increasingly bellicose rhetoric against China by US politicians and foreign policy figures. In November, the Hoover Institution released a report urging \u201cconstructive vigilance\u201d against Chinese efforts to influence American society. The report\u2019s authors warned against subjecting Chinese Americans to \u201cthe kind of generalized suspicion or stigmatization that could lead to racial profiling or a new era of McCarthyism\u201d, but also argued that \u201cthe Chinese American community\u201d was a target of influence efforts. The report has garnered criticism from dissenting experts who say it will lead to racial profiling. In April, a group of former government officials and foreign policy figures revived the coldwar-era Committee on the Present Danger as a new organization with a focus on opposing China. At a launch event for the group, Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser and far-right figurehead, railed against Huawei, saying: \u201cHuawei is the People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2026 5G turns data into plutonium that can be weaponized and they intend to weaponize.\u201d Andy Li, a Chinese American college student and member of the Silicon Valley Chinese Association, said that he had noticed increased hostility toward Chinese students on campus, and that the climate was also raising concerns about job prospects for Asian Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s also this newer fear that for Asian Americans, and especially Chinese Americans, it\u2019s going to be harder to get jobs, especially in tech, cybersecurity, and scientific research,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this fear that even after you\u2019ve assimilated and become a citizen, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re a national security threat.\u201d Other individuals who spoke to the Guardian were less concerned about increased hostilities. Patrick Ma, a software engineer with an American-born mother and Hong Kong-born father, said that he was happy to be a \u201cglobal citizen\u201d and that he hadn\u2019t experienced any discrimination. \u201cThe Chinese have so much to be grateful for to Trump,\u201d he said, because actions like the Huawei blacklist would force the company to launch its own operating system and improve China\u2019s economy. Juliet Shen, a Chinese American product manager at Snap, said that she did have concerns about racial profiling, but not for herself. \u201cMy concerns are more for my parents, who are scientists, and there\u2019s similar allegations of espionage, suspicion [and] discrimination towards Chinese scientists right now too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a little bit of a concern but definitely has ramped up in recent months [and] years. The Chinese academic and science community has been very panicked and afraid.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
