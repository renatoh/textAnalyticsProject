Let us live in harmony together, and agree to disagree on some aspects of motherhood, but stand united on the important ones. Let us make life on earth beautiful and joyful for all mothers ...\" Unless, of course, those mothers are involved in running a website called Mumsnet, where some members have occasionally posted critical comments about the author of the Contented Little Baby Book, prompting Ms Ford's solicitors to demand the removal of the website. In an official statement (on her own website), Ms Ford claims that Mumsnet published \"very serious and offensive libels about me\". By way of an example, she says that one item \"compared me with terrorists in the Middle East\". This is thought to relate to a comment from one mother, alleging that Ms Ford \"straps babies to rockets and fires them into south Lebanon\". We cannot stress too much here that this is not something Ms Ford has ever advocated, even for the most fractious baby. Admittedly, she writes in her Contented Little Baby Book, she can be firm. But fair. \"With the ones that fight sleep,\" she says, \"because I know that they are well fed, burped and ready to sleep, I am very strict.\" And yet still, with admirable self-control, she refrains from blasting the contrary infants into south Lebanon, or, indeed, anywhere closer to hand, being happy to \"let them fuss and yell for 10-12 minutes until they have settled themselves\". So much for leaving babies to cry! \"It's not about what I think: it's about what you want and you think,\" she stresses in Good Mother Bad Mother. \"We live in a democracy.\" She urges mothers to be \"tolerant of each other and honest with each other\". But, as with babies who have been fed, burped and prepared for bed yet still fight sleep, there comes a point with her critics when she has to be very strict. It's time for Mumsnet to shut up and go to sleep. \"I have therefore been advised by my solicitors to consider issuing a writ in the High Court in London for libel,\" she says, \"though I very much hope this will not be necessary.\" With the offending Mumset postings now withdrawn, it is difficult to say what - other than the baby-missile comment - could have so outraged Ms Ford. And difficult, similarly, to understand what it is about her books that might have provoked such misunderstanding and criticism. Does she really come across like a baby-murderer? Having now read her advice, I would say: absolutely not. On the contrary, Ms Ford is determined to protect babies, for instance from mothers whose displays of excessive affection can prove so ruinous to a regular routine. \"Overhandling prior to sleep time is another major problem with young babies,\" she says. \"Everyone wants just one little cuddle. Unfortunately, several little cuddles add up and can leave the baby fretful, overtired and difficult to settle. Your baby is not a toy.\" And the advice? \"Do not feel guilty about restricting handling in the early weeks ...\" Some of our more sentimental mothers have, no doubt, felt challenged by the requirement to cuddle-ration, along with Ford's exhortations to deny eye contact at bedtimes, to rouse sleeping infants at 7am, and to judge between what their guru regards as \"genuine\" hunger and the other type that three- and four-month-old babies presumably just put on for effect. Perhaps they are suffering the after-effects of original sin? At any rate, after so many permissive baby books, Ms Ford makes no apology for a firmness which - in the absence of implanted microchips and regular alarums - could hardly do more to have your devious little newborn operating like a well-oiled machine. Indeed, she confidently states, her method with early-morning waking (\"no talking or eye contact\") \"has worked for the hundreds of babies I have cared for, none of whom ever got up before 7am once they were sleeping through the night\". Ever! Similarly, she has never had one baby who refused breast milk after bottle feeding. Never! Small wonder that - for all her critics - Ms Ford's patent regimen has proved so popular with a generation of working mothers, selling - according to her website - more than 500,000 copies. Naturally, these few comments cannot begin to convey the quantities of advice, supported by detailed charts and timetables, contained in Ms Ford's baby books, much of which could only have been devised by a person with her wealth of experience and, you might think, by a person with her degree of objectivity. It must, after all, be that much easier to \"restrict handling\", or wake a newborn at dawn on a winter morning, when you have not personally given birth to it. And it is unusual, I think, to hear a new mother describe her own baby, however demanding, as being \"fussy\", or prone to \"yelling\". Both are key words in the Contented Little Baby's vocabulary. On the other hand, Ms Ford argues that her own childlessness does not affect her authority as a mistress of this notably unyielding \"common-sense approach\" to child-rearing, and anyone who has read Good Mother Bad Mother will know that her intolerance of unwarranted fussing, and respect for physical boundaries, does not apply only to other people's babies. The book opens with Ford's last meeting with her dying mother. She told her mother, who was in hospital, that she had a cold, and therefore couldn't touch her. \"It wasn't true. I knew that if I touched her, even for a moment, I would break down completely and beg her not to die ... I was heartbroken - I couldn't go near her, to hug my mother, even though she was dying.\" It was this mother-daughter relationship, the book explains, that has \"shaped the choices she has made\". Interesting. \u00b7 This week Catherine read James Shapiro's 1599, A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare: \"Fascinating. Although I sort of regret discovering that Shakespeare hoarded malt in a famine.\" Catherine studied \"more photographs of senior politicians and their wives in swimsuits. The Menzies Campbells excepted. Age discrimination or indifference?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
