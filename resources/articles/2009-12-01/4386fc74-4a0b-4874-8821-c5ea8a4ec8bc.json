She last sang opera in 2004, but recently announced that she would appear in Der Rosenkavalier next April in Cologne in what will be her final appearances on the operatic stage. Meanwhile, she has continued to give concerts over the intervening years, and this recital, accompanied by Jonathan Papp, gave an indication of her current vocal estate. Not surprisingly, at 65, some of the creamy substance of her lyric soprano at its peak has gone, but remarkably little. At the opening of her programme, which began with Mozart's Masonic Cantata K619 and continued with eight Richard Strauss songs, her middle range was not quite matched with her upper register, and there was an occasional sense of the tone sagging. These faults gradually lessened over the course of the evening. What was amazing was how the surface of her tone remains unblemished. Her diction is arguably better, and she seems, overall, a more relaxed performer. She is certainly still a communicative one, with the ability to put this capacity audience completely at ease. In Lasciami!, a surprisingly serious song by Tosti, Puccini's Sole e Amore, and two of Canteloube's Songs of the Auvergne, she entered into the varied moods of each item, articulating them perfectly. Halfway through the concert, she introduced a tenor, one of many young artists she is helping to develop through her educational activities. The Korean Jungsoo Yun gave an accomplished account of standard arias from Boh\u00e8me and Werther. \"He is the beginning, I am the end,\" she joked. But the end, it seems, is not quite in sight yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
