Richard Howitt, MEP for the east of England, is on his feet. Howitt is concerned about the spying activities of the authorities in Colombia against those who highlight human rights abuses. Previously Karel de Gucht, the European trade commissioner, promised to investigate. It's a hot topic. On Monday, the office of the UN commissioner for human rights in Colombia reported evidence of continued illegal spying. What's happening, demanded Howitt. Hold on, said De Gucht, theatrically whipping out his mobile phone. \"I am consulting my own intelligence services,\" he said. He then read out a text message suspiciously close to the Colombian government's line that the problem is solved because the intelligence service has been closed. Then he slipped his phone back into his pocket and moved on to other business. The commissioner for comedy. Truly statesmanlike don't you think? \u2022 Here, meanwhile, we see indications that the prime minister has trouble satisfying his rightwing partners. A revolt on immigration here, a broadside about the 50% rate of tax there. Nonstop grumbling about his emasculation by the Lib Dems. And now, from the youthful right, an apparent defection. Because he has his ear to the ground, he will have heard of Alexandra Swann. She did various helping-out things at the Commons for his colleague David Morris, MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, but more notably she served until the last general election as deputy chair of the go-ahead youth wing Conservative Future. And now, she has let her party membership lapse: destination Ukip. \"I have been a libertarian for a long time,\" she tells us. \"I have been a Conservative member since I was 16 and campaigning since I was 14. But I don't know if I have ever been a true Conservative. Ukip is more along the lines I believe in.\" Dave's fab, she says, but \"because of the coalition, the Conservative party is in a difficult position. There are a lot of unconservative policies.\" As for Nigel Farage: \"I think he is fantastic.\" Well, she's young. And it's all relative, isn't it? \u2022 And a message to the PM. While you're putting the world to rights, bullying Labour Ed, lecturing Europe on human rights, could you have a word with your man Steve Hilton. All very well for him to be careering around Downing Street with his shoes and socks off, but the other day we encountered him in Benugo, the trendy bar of the British Film Institute, having an ale with a male companion. Shoeless, on a tall stool with his trademark scruffy trainers abandoned on the floor next to his courier bag. What about the other drinkers? Don't they have human rights too? \u2022 Amid the swirl of hostility and invective whizzing around Twitter and the internet, signs that the rich and famous are ready to fight back. According to the Stage newspaper, the writer Susan Hill, author of The Woman in Black, has had enough. Hill told an audience at the British Library of an email she received. \"Hi Sue,\" it said. \"I'm doing your book, we have read it and I just want to say it's the most boring crap I ever read, so thanks for ruining my life.\" To which she replied: \"Well, somebody had to.\" Go Susan. That's the spirit. \u2022 And finally, a message to the lady with the shoulder-length brown hair who took to broadcasting the worries of her parliamentary master \"Nick\" to the top deck of the 27 bus in west London over a torturous half-hour earlier this week. A few things to say: one is that it was presumptuous to keep parroting the mantra \"your constituency seat is safe\". More so to keep describing it as an \"easy seat\", even if that did seem necessary \u2013 from what passengers around could hear \u2013 to calm the poor man down. Our \"election plan will work\", she said. And soon, she promised, she would reveal to him \"the structure of our campaign\". Sooner rather than later, by the sound of things. And if it can be done in a way that doesn't tear a deck-load of commuters away from their iPods, so much the better.
