The coach Alan Jones and youth coach Mark Cox have lost their jobs and Bates' previous post as head of men's national training becomes vacant. David Felgate, the recently appointed performance director, also hopes that John McEnroe may become involved in short-term coaching. The changes come as a result of a three-month review of the department's operations by Felgate, who hopes to appoint a head of physical training and an Under-14 performance manager by October 1, when the overhaul comes into effect. Felgate said: \"This is not a revolution in British tennis but in three or four years I want to be sitting at Wimbledon watching lots more [British] players. \"I have taken a good look at things around the country and I feel I know where we should go. We will be able to get Jeremy into areas of women's and Under-14s tennis and enable him to get out on court where we want him to be. \"The academies will open their doors up and be responsible for identifying young talent. We have the talent but we need to create more and keep people in the game.\" The ATP, the ruling body of men's tennis, will respond in the near future to a letter from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) offering an independent review after seven ATP players, six of them unidentified, tested positive for traces of the drug nandrolone between August last year and this May. The ATP announced last week that an electrolyte replacement product, given to players by Tour trainers, may have been contaminated, and admitted that the ATP, not the players, was culpable. However, Wada pointed out that this was only a theory and as such was not conclusive. The International Tennis Federation yesterday responded to a letter sent to them during Wimbledon and signed by several former players, including John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Martina Navratilova, suggesting that large rackets had made the game \"unbalanced and one-dimensional\". \"The topic is a complicated one and there are no guarantees that the suggestions made [to make racket heads smaller] will accomplish the effect that you hope to achieve,\" said Francesco Ricci Bitti, the president of the ITF. However, the issue will be discussed further at the ITF Tennis Science and Technology Congress in London at the end of the month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
