I would tell her she was not related to me and was, in fact, the milkman's daughter. One day I hatched a plan: I told my mum I wanted to learn how to write a signature and asked her to write hers (on a folded piece of paper). I walked away with a sly grin, and stuck the piece of paper on my sister's bedroom door. On the other side of the paper, I had written a note that said: \"Dear Lucy, I have been keeping this a secret but have to tell you that you are the milkman's daughter, signed \u2026\" Needless to say, Lucy cried her eyes out, and then I got caught and seriously knacked! Anabel Drought Our relationship was shaky enough after the birth of No 3 \u2013 having spent five years being the two of us, my younger brother \"won\" when our baby brother arrived (I wanted a sister). I was the eldest: desperate for approval, hard-working, \"good\". He became the middle child \u2013 big time. I never thought he was particularly jealous, just annoying. That all changed the day he cut up all my gym, music and swimming certificates, which I had meticulously added to a scrapbook. Modest achievements, but every single record \u2013 including my certificate announcing the number of lengths I had swum in the presence of the Olympian David Wilkie at a sponsored swim, plus a photo with the man himself \u2013 was shredded. My father made him sit and write to all the awarding authorities, explaining what he had done and asking if replacements could be provided. For the most part, they were. However, in one case, the man responsible turned up in person with replacement certificates for me \u2013 and a bag of chocolate bars for my brother. Apparently my brother's letter had the office in stitches. They felt sorry \u2013 for him! It took a long time for our relationship to recover. Sally Sellwood It had been a difficult week. David, five, and baby Ben had a nasty bug, and we had all traipsed back and forth to the doctor's surgery several times. I was busy mopping fevered brows, washing clothes, changing beds, trying to cope with the mess. As I devoted all my attention to his brothers, three-year-old Matthew watched in silent but growing resentment. Finally, one evening he burst into tears. \"Mummy,\" he sobbed, \"I'm really sick.\" Guiltily I hauled him on to my knee and hugged him. \"You poor darling,\" I soothed. \"Tell me what's wrong.\" \"I have to go to the doctor now! I'm tired, and I'm sad, and \u2026 and my eyebrows are sore \u2013 and my hair hurts too!\" he finished triumphantly. I stroked his hair and kissed him. \"You poor boy, you've had a tough time,\" I said, \"but I think I know what's wrong with you.\" He waited hopefully, enjoying the moment. \"I think you've got sibling rivalry,\" I added gently. For a moment he looked puzzled, then suddenly his face cleared. \"Yes, I have, Mummy,\" he said bravely, \"and it hurts!\" Janet Gilbert My uncles so resented their sister \u2013 my mum \u2013 that they tried to drown her. They chose their time. She was six, already playing truant in order to sing and play the piano. The family could not afford lessons, but there was an instrument in the front room. My nan took in washing, and it was easier to indulge little Gladys than take her to school. Gladys had a tiny leopard-skin coat, which had arrived on the family's leather stall in Brick Lane, east London. This symbolised the distance between her and her brothers: she had the coat, they wore Grandad's cut-down jackets; she entertained the neighbours in the best parlour, they played in the street; she excelled at drawing, singing and dancing, they failed frowningly. So they followed her back from the sweet shop and pushed her into the ornamental pond in Victoria Park. They held her ringlets firmly, drowning the silk ribbons, soaking the coat. She was rescued by a passing man, arrived home wet, and stirred up more hatred by telling all. Anonymous My brother and I always got along. There were the usual sibling spats and, being younger, I was often teased to the point of tears \u2013 there's nothing like being pinned down and having the threat of dribble plopping on to your face to make you run crying to Mum. We share the same sense of humour as our parents and, even now, he can make me laugh like no other. He recently stayed with us when he was working shifts at Gatwick, and as I work in London I didn't get to see him. To ensure I knew he had been there and to leave his \"mark\", when I came home I found he had left my poor old teds hanging by their ears, from a trouser hanger! My brother is 39. Sarah Goldsack I was five and an only child until my brother, Christopher, came along. I didn't take much notice until the time came for him to start school. Suddenly, I found myself his keeper: taking him to school and \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 to the Super Saturday Show at our local cinema. My new-found independence was being snatched away, and I began to resent his existence. One summer day, Mum took us to a stream to fish for sticklebacks. Glass jars and fishing nets in hand, we stood on the bank peering disappointedly into the murky water. It had rained heavily all week, and the normally trickling stream was now fast flowing. Just as we were turning to leave, I heard a \"plop\" followed by Mum's scream. Christopher had fallen in and was being swept rapidly downstream. Mum ran along the river bank, panic on her face, and I followed. We ran ahead and waded into the water, managed to catch him between us, and dragged him on to the bank. He coughed and spluttered, but was unharmed. I walked home that day holding Christopher's hand tightly and felt glad I still had a little brother. Lynn Brand I was 12 when my only sibling was born. Whatever rivalry occurred in the short time we spent together was as nothing compared with that before her birth. Though I have no memory of the occasion, one of our mother's favourite stories was that, on learning of the imminent arrival of a brother or sister, I immediately told my father he was a dirty bastard. No one could be more astonished than me that, at such an age, at such a time in the innocent 1950s, I would have had any inkling of the male role in the process necessary to produce offspring. Needless to say, any subsequent rivalries between my sister and me were surely inconsequential: I remember her only as a playful delight, and she has always loved me like no other. So, somewhere in my youth, not childhood, I must have done something good. David Lusted Until I was five, I had always felt equal to my sister. Nineteen months older than me, she was a superb playmate and confidante in everything: tree-house building, bug funerals, dressing up. But by this time, her above-average reading skills far surpassed my tentative \"See Spot Run\" efforts. She was motoring through the Narnia Chronicles and Treasure Island. Then I heard my mother tell a family friend how proud she was of my sister's appetite for books. I had had enough. I stomped into the kitchen laden with a pile of the most impressive-looking books from our shelves and announced that I had just finished them. My mother asked me to describe the stories to the assembled company. I had no clue and with only the jacket pictures and titles to guide me, I launched into full-blown descriptions of \"kids who lived in the woods\" (The Swiss Family Robinson) and \"lots of stories about different things beginning with R\" (Children's Encyclopaedia, volume 18). I was set straight and given a lecture on lying. Happily, my reading improved and I managed to forgive my sister. We have had a true rivalry ever since, but I love her. Thirty years on, she has five kids and so, defeated but content with my one, I have finally eased off the competition. Mae Chambers I have twin sisters, Jenny and Gill, or Fatty and Bossy as I called them as a child. They are identical and, at times, the rivalry between them has been intense, not to mention amusing for the rest of the family. How we have laughed over the years at their wailing laments of \"I've got five more pimples than Gill\" or \"Why, why is Jenny thinner?\" Gill has slight curvature of the spine and has always claimed it happened because Jenny kicked her back on the way out of the womb. She says this as though citing an irrefutable medical fact, and in the midst of one of their frenzied arguments, will declare that Jenny did it deliberately. Jenny hates it that Gill is regarded as the eldest just because she was delivered first, with Jenny popping out 10 minutes later. When my father inherited a family heirloom and gave it to Gill, as the firstborn, Jenny was livid: \"Ten minutes! I was born just 10 minutes later and she gets the inlaid backgammon table!\" Nevertheless, they have always had a powerful bond, and I can't imagine one surviving without the other. Margot Lawrence \"Now you look reellee luffleee!\" my mother heard my four-year-old brother Pete saying, as she came into the living room to announce lunch. Pete was holding a large pair of dressmaker's scissors and looking at our two-year-old brother, who was clutching his head and chuckling happily as he pirouetted on a puddle of golden-white curls at his tiny feet. Our younger brother had such incredible curls that elderly Welsh matrons and complete strangers would stop in the street in wonder and admiration as my mother pushed him to the shops with Pete holding on to the pushchair. \"What's his name, love?\" they would ask my mother. \"David! Well! What a beautiful name that is, then!\" they would exclaim. Pete stood next to my mother unnoticed, but clearly the delight in his little brother had got to him \u2013 he decided to cut off the magnificent curls. Some weeks later when we were all playing together, he told me that he had also changed David's name to \"Bill\" and \"Bill\" it has remained for the rest of his life. Now in their late 60s, my two brothers are still \u2013 as they always have been \u2013 very, very good friends. Elizabeth Gruenbaum When I was five, I was hit by a truck on our Toronto street and my brother, Joe, ran to tell Mum. I never really thanked him. Instead, he took some tough blows from me over the years. Once, I accidentally cracked him across the head with a baseball bat while practising my swing. When we were teenagers dating girls from the same neighbourhood, we shared a taxi and I inadvertently slammed the door on his head. We delivered newspapers and when I went away to school, Joe kept up the route and shared the profits with me without complaint. We did come to blows after I had argued with Dad at the supper table. Joe defended Dad and I turned the kitchen table upside down on him. There didn't seem to be many hard feelings. Years later, I tried to swim across the river at a cottage and he saved me as I gasped for air halfway across. Joe died of cancer a few years ago. We had some talks about all this before he went, but I'm sure there was more I could have said. Mind you, I still talk to him daily as I wander around London. John P Asling I had vaguely blamed my parents for not protecting me against burning, blows, captivity, threats, confiscation of all that was mine, and deactivated bicycle brakes (very nearly killed me, that one). Their solution at the time, when pressed by outsiders, was to send me away until my brother left home. I sublimated it all. Until the day 40 years later when my husband and I wanted to buy land and, knowing what we had bid in a sealed auction, my brother put in a bigger bid to stop us, unless we gave him something else we owned that he wanted. His explanation: I \u2013 two-and-a-half years younger than him \u2013 had supposedly, aged two, taken his tiny tricycle. Anonymous Ooh, so many stories \u2013 which one to use? The winning choice is the time my sister, Jude, led me out of the back garden into the field on the promise of some cake. I would have been about three or four, and she about six, and I was not allowed out of the garden under any circumstances. She told me she had made some very special chocolate cake, and I was allowed to have the first piece. I couldn't wait. She told me to close my eyes and popped some \"cake\" in my mouth. The recipe appeared to consist solely of dock leaves and dog poo! Revenge was sweet, but took several years to execute, it being mighty hard to get one over on a big sister. I delighted in giving Jude a pack of fruit gums, which I had lovingly wee'd on, and allowed to dry ... Sue Wells We went to the steel gala when we were young, an event held each year by British Steel for the whole community. One of the highlights was the fancy dress competition. Our mam made some amazing costumes over the years for the three of us (my sister Donna, brother Jonathan and me) including one unforgettable turn as Snap, Crackle and Pop from the Rice Krispies ads. But the year we won, we went as Robin Hood, Maid Marian and Friar Tuck. My brother was clearly going to be Robin, so one of us girls had to be the fat friar. It was Donna. And for the next 25 years it was her number one reason for proving I was the favourite. Any time we squabbled, the Friar Tuck incident was brought up, even though it wasn't me who put her in a robe and bald patch. What I did do was take the photo into the office where we both worked for everyone to see her at her bald best. Although, I did ask her permission to send this story in, so maybe she's finally found her inner friar and forgiven me. Rebecca Muddiman My parents love me and my brother equally. Yet, if you go round to their house, you'll find it a shrine to the creative talents of my younger sibling. Eight years ago he embarked on a career as an artist, a noble endeavour, but hardly lucrative. Keen to help out, my folks bought a number of his paintings and commissioned many more until there was barely a square inch of wall that was not covered by a tasteful nude, portrait of a fondly remembered pet or well-known city skyline rising from a dreamy haze of oils. Working in public relations, I can't compete. Although they are proud of my achievements, I am not sure my parents would appreciate a framed copy of a press release. But, while my brother has colonised the walls, I have launched a counter-offensive on the remaining unoccupied territory with my ace card \u2013 fatherhood. Every Christmas and birthday, my parents are presented with the latest photograph of my irresistibly cute young sons, for which they make room on the increasingly crowded shelves. Inch by inch, I am making up the lost ground. Chris Collett I have only to open my wedding album to be reminded what jealousy looks like. It was 1974. An unconventional do was planned with me in a cream floral dress and my sister, as my only bridesmaid, in a pink dress, which we had chosen together. All was going well until we arrived at the register office and my jealous sister turned up in a long, white dress.
