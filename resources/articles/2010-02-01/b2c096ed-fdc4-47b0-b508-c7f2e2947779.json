President Obama has tried to help by directing stimulus money at the arts, but his latest budget sees overall funding decline. With only about 10% of funding coming from government, the reliance on ticket and gift sales (50%), and private sponsorship (about 40%) leave organisations at the whim of a basic economic equation: when times are good, the arts are swimming in money; when times are bad, they are parched. With state support forming such a small proportion of revenue, theatres, museums, orchestras and the like have been hit badly by falling ticket sales due to the recession. Philanthropy has been hit too, with rich individual donors and foundations seeing their investment income plummet, taking with it their ability to dish out cash. Large institutions have also suffered from shrinking endowments. New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art shed 14% of its staff after the value of its investments fell $600m (\u00a3388m). Best idea Giving creative types free rein without red tape. Worst idea Thinking said creative types can live on air and water alone. Biggest casualty That seed of innovation that never gets the chance to grow. Ed Pilkington France It was always going to take more than a recession to end France's love affair with the arts. A Picasso exhibition that opened at the height of la crise scored record ticket sales for the Grand Palais in Paris; the Centre Pompidou reported that 2008 had been its best year of the noughties; and, across France, cinemas haven't been this busy since 1981. But there are cracks. While the cultural powerhouses boomed, lesser-known institutions, often outside Paris, had their funding slashed and now see their futures hanging in the balance. Amid the gloom, President Sarkozy attempted to present himself as a saviour of the arts, vowing to \"make culture our response to the global economic crisis\", and marking out \u20ac100m (\u00a388m) for national museums and heritage sites. But his efforts have had limited impact. Insiders fear that generous subsidies will be radically cut. The recession coincided with Sarkozy's plans to cut public service jobs, which sparked strikes last autumn, and a project to confer the running of provincial monuments to local authorities has met with opposition. Best idea: Sarkozy earmarked \u20ac750m (\u00a3660m) for a project to put books, films and museum treasures online. Worst idea Sarkozy's fixation with creating a museum devoted to the history of France. Biggest casualty The 104, a much-vaunted Paris arts space opened in 2008, has already fallen on hard times. Lizzy Davies Ireland Dublin is seeking Unesco designation as a City of Literature, but at a time when funding for writers has been slashed. The Irish Writers' Centre has been told by the Arts Council of Ireland it will not receive any grant this year; and 30 or so other funding organisations have suffered cuts, following the government's budget. Compared to last year, \u20ac9m (\u00a37.9m)was taken from the arts budget. Opera Ireland, Opera Theatre Company and the Wexford Opera festival will have their funds cut by up to 7%. Around 300 artistic companies will have their grants cut this year. Only 10 will see an increase. Best idea Writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn believes that Ireland's art will flourish in the recession, more than it did during the years of the economic boom. Worst idea The arts council giving no money this year to the Irish Writers' Centre which has become a nursery for talented novelists and poets. Biggest casualty The Abbey theatre, arguably Ireland's the most famous artistic forum, has had its funding cut by more than \u20ac1m.
