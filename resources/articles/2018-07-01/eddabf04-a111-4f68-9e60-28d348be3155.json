Jos\u00e9 Pekerman\u2019s team were inspired by James Rodr\u00edguez before being eliminated by the hosts, Brazil, in 2014. The Bayern Munich forward, on loan from Real Madrid, expects to feature at some stage at Spartak Stadium after scans on the leg injury sustained against Senegal revealed he had not suffered a muscle tear, and Ospina is confident England can be beaten to force passage into the last eight. \u201cWe are a better team than four years ago,\u201d the Arsenal goalkeeper said. \u201cWe are together, more experienced and a stronger squad of players than we were in Brazil. We have experience and good quality. Our players play in the best clubs, the best leagues, and are used to playing in matches of this size, so nothing will frighten us. England are a good team but we did not mind who it was we would face. We just know we will give everything for our country and take strength from the support. We always give everything for our country. It\u2019s such an honour to play for Colombia.\u201d Around 30,000 Colombian fans have been in Russia and another 10,000 are apparently heading to Moscow for the country\u2019s third appearance in the knockout stages of the competition. They will heavily outnumber their English counterparts. \u201cThe support has been incredible,\u201d Ospina said. \u201cIt\u2019s been our inspiration. There are Colombians all over the world but the support here, in Russia, has meant everything to us. \u201cIt shows the passion and belief that we have in our country. It\u2019s just amazing how many people have come here to support us. It has felt like a home game in every game for us. They make more noise, have more colour and we always have more supporters than the rest. It shows how much football means to our country. It\u2019s not pressure, it\u2019s strength for us.\u201d The 29-year-old, capped 89 times, is to discuss his future at Arsenal after his tournament ends, having been linked again with a move to Fenerbahce in search of more regular football. The Premier League club have bought Bernd Leno for \u00a319m from Bayer Leverkusen and the Germany international will surely compete with Petr Cech to be first choice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
