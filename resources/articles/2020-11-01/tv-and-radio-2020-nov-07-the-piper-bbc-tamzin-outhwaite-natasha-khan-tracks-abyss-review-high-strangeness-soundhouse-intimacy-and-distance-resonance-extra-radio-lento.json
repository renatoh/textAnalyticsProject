I know! A sentence that, from start to finish, I never imagined I could ever write. British audio drama has been crocky and old-fashioned for years (was anyone surprised that The Archers\u2019 first lockdown was so immensely switch-offable?), but recent podcast drama series have given the medium a kick up its hoo-ha. Especially spooky podcast dramas. Audio means you don\u2019t have to use special effects to create a terrifying other world, merely the right sounds and the listener\u2019s imagination, and from Alice Isn\u2019t Dead on, it has been the off-kilter shows that have worked the best. For anyone who likes creeping dread, The Piper, just out on BBC Sounds, is excellent. I listened without reading anything at all about it, and found the first episode a little hard to follow. But once I\u2019d sorted out all the characters\u2019 relationships to each other, I was away. (Anyway, it\u2019s nice not to have every element spoon-fed; it keeps you concentrating.) Set in Kent, it\u2019s a tale of disappearing children, with Tamzin Outhwaite as Ali, a detective who\u2019s trying to work out who, or what, is taking them. Outhwaite is very good, as are all the actors (the kids are great), and, though there are a couple of yeah-right moments, there aren\u2019t many. Writers Vickie Donoghue and Natalie Mitchell know how to keep things real-but-unreal, and the acting, plotting and atmosphere keep everything lickety-splitting along. Music is important \u2013 there\u2019s a piano riff that the children keep hearing \u2013 and the producers have cleverly got Natasha Khan, AKA Bat for Lashes, to compose the moody soundtrack. Actually, the repeated piano motif reminded me a little of the scary TV shows of my youth, and there\u2019s something of Tales of the Unexpected about The Piper, though it\u2019s far slicker and more detailed (we know it\u2019s a weekend evening because we hear the Strictly theme tune). The pacing of information is interesting: the kids, and the listener, work out what\u2019s happening far earlier than the adults. This keeps you engaged, in that \u201cDon\u2019t do that, you wally!\u201d manner of horror films. The fear of losing children is one that will twist any parent\u2019s stomach, and the \u201cHe\u2019s here\u2026\u201d element is one that never fails to frighten. Another longer but no less excellent drama is Tracks. The first episodes of the fifth series, Abyss, started a couple of weeks ago, and, as ever, this is a gripping tale of weirdness, coincidence and conspiracy theories. Written by Matthew Broughton, this show started in 2016, with Romola Garai as Helen Ash, a GP with a less than sensitive bedside manner who gets involved in a plane crash that sets her looking for her father. Tracks is one of the dramas that thoroughly bum-kicked the old school, and previous series won British podcast awards and were a hit on iTunes, while dragging listeners all over the shop. (The second series, Strata, which I enjoyed, though others rated less highly, gave us a prequel, with a small boy being swallowed by a Welsh hillside.) We\u2019ve had impossible pregnancies, fishy car crashes, bad government workers and much sea involvement, as well as an uneasy sense of time shifting and dark forces at work (they\u2019re always \u201cat work\u201d, aren\u2019t they?). In series three, Garai was replaced by Hattie Morahan, before returning for series four; this series has Olivia Poulet as poor old Helen, now with only a few months to live and getting strange email messages from her dead father. The sound, characterisation and ambience of Tracks, as well as the brilliant storytelling, makes this one of the best long-running audio dramas ever. Still on a spooky note, but this time with added laughs, Audible\u2019s High Strangeness is a daft paranormal drama that has Cassie, played by Sophie McShera, chasing weird events for her sci-fi/strange happenings vlog. She hooks up with Glen (Adam James), a worldweary US agent whose job is to close down any paranormal events. McShera gives it a lot of gusto and this is a funny show that plays on familiar stereotypes (country bumpkins, mad cults). It\u2019s like Doctor Who for your ears: upbeat, quick-witted, not really scary, but immensely enjoyable. There you go: if you\u2019re back to redecorating the house, these three dramas will take you through lockdown and beyond. I enjoyed them all. Who\u2019d ever have thunk? Three places to find experimental audio Soundhouse: Intimacy and Distance In 2018, London\u2019s Barbican Centre asked Soundhouse, a platform for creative broadcasting run by Eleanor McDowall and Nina Garthwaite, to host a pop-up venue that focused on communal listening. This year, Soundhouse at the Barbican is online and you can choose from one of three listening rooms, curated by audio artists Ariana Martinez, Arlie Adlington and Axel Kacouti\u00e9. Their choices come from all over the world, and are worth settling into: you get unidentifiable noises, kids chatting, chopped-up descriptions of hope or identity. Think of a video room at an art gallery: these \u201crooms\u201d are like that, but with sound. There are accompanying essays too. Resonance Extra In the UK, the most consistent home for experimental audio has long been Resonance FM. Aside from its regular schedule of offbeat and on-the-edge music, it has collaborated with several artists and art institutions over the years. If you go to the website and click on Resonance Extra, there\u2019s a vast array of soundscapes, from rippling water sounds and weirdness, music and haiku poetry, to squidgy driving house, excellent for late-night motorway journeys (Superfluid 27). There will be something here you can work, drive, run, or open your mind to. I really like the recent Shimmering Moods, just put up on Wednesday. Radio Lento Ambient outdoor sounds of nature are almost commonplace now when it comes to alternative audio, but it\u2019s always nice to highlight those who bother to make these lovely listens. Radio Lento offers lots of different environments, from summer breezes in a field of wheat, to the noise of rain on an umbrella, to some deer in a wood, trotting about and making honking deer noises, to the sounds of a sleeper train from Paris-Austerlitz to Portbou (that one made me yearn a bit). Not experimental really, but immersive (3D sound) and perfect for when your head needs a break."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
