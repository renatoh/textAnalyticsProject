That is the very clear message coming from the St David's Day opinion poll conducted for BBC Wales by ICM this week. At first glance, David Cameron may nevertheless be tempted to dismiss the new poll. Only 7% of the Welsh voters surveyed by ICM say they want Wales to be an independent country \u2013 though admittedly the figure rises to 12% if Scotland were to vote for separation in 2014. Either way, these are not figures to send a chill through London politicians' hearts. It would be a mistake, though, to assume that the persistent recent failure of Plaid Cymru to match the surge of support for the Scottish National party means that Welsh national feeling is a phenomenon of little political account. The BBC/ICM poll figures which should concentrate minds are those which concern the Welsh assembly's powers. Only one in three Welsh voters (32%) agree with the status quo in which the assembly has no tax-varying powers at all. The other two-thirds are split between wanting the assembly to have power over some taxes (36%) and all taxes (28%). Either of these changes would represent a major change in the political geometry of the UK. The old assumption that Wales would always back away from radical change in its relationship with London is in steady and fascinating decline. Independence may not be on the agenda, but further Welsh self-government certainly is. The nation which voted by a ratio of 4:1 against devolution in 1979, then in favour of devolution by a whisker in 1997, last year voted by nearly 2:1 for devolved legislative powers and is now, according to the new poll, in favour of some form of taxation powers by a similar margin. This is a large shift of sentiment with big political implications. Devolution in Wales has not thrown up the kind of full-frontal challenge to the United Kingdom that has been generated in Scotland. But the movements of opinion in Wales pose unavoidable questions about political relationships nevertheless, even if Scotland votes to stay in the union. The UK government has established a commission on Welsh fiscal devolution which has now been given a significant push by the new poll. There is talk of devolving policing to Wales (it has happened in Scotland and Northern Ireland), and Wales's first minister Carwyn Jones favours some sort of distinctive Welsh legal system. Mr Jones spoke yesterday of the future prospect of a looser UK with multiple centres of accountability. All these ideas push in the same direction towards the need to address Welsh feeling afresh and towards a more imaginative approach to the possibilities, not least for England, of a more federal UK. Generations have been brought up to think of \"England &amp; Wales\" as one. But those days are ebbing away. Today there is England. And there is Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
