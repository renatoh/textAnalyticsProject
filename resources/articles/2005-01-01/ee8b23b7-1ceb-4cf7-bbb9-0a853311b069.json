Powell's side will face Finland at the City of Manchester Stadium on June 5 and Denmark and Sweden at Blackburn's Ewood Park on June 8 and June 11 respectively in Group A, while the Germans face France, Norway and Italy in Group B. England, who qualified automatically as hosts, have never won a competitive match against the Germans. Powell said: \"I was pleased to have avoided Germany. I put bets on myself that we would draw them. \"Sweden is tough, Finland is tough, Denmark will be tough. We've never beaten Germany and they're the clear-cut favourites. Am I happy that we haven't got Germany? Of course I am. Am I happy that we've got Sweden? Well, what can I say about that?\" Powell believes the draw guarantees a close, competitive tournament and she continued: \"Both groups are balanced and it gives everybody a chance. \"As a result of the balance we should have a good competition. Now we know the draw we can discuss it, go away and reflect on it. It's just important that the girls put on a good display and don't let anyone down and hopefully the work they've done in the last two years will be reflected in the summer.\" The England coach feels that the crowds in the north-west, where the national team have had several friendlies over the past two years, will take to the competition and she is looking forward to the attention the tournament will bring to the sport. \"It's going to be a big event, not just on the pitch but off the pitch. The more support the merrier and we do value any support we get. You would always like to see more support. We won't be satisfied until stadiums are packed out, but we are making strides in the right direction.\" Powell's side have a friendly with Italy in February and a training camp in the Algarve before further games in March and April, and she added: \"This six months becomes like four weeks. It'll be here before we know it.\" Euro 2005 draw Group A England Sweden Finland Denmark Group B Germany France Norway Italy June 5 England v Finland City of Manchester Stadium, 7pm June 8 England v Denmark Ewood Park, Blackburn, 6pm June 11 England v Sweden Ewood Park, Blackburn, 4pm Semi-finals June 15/16 Final June 19 Ewood Park , 3.15pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
