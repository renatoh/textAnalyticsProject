Macedonia scored twice in the draw at St Mary's Stadium last season and they may be further encouraged if Sven-Goran Eriksson's regular back four is not intact. Rio Ferdinand missed Manchester United's defeat to Southampton yesterday and he was also absent from the victory over Wolves last week. He has been affected by a kidney complaint and the timing of his recovery is uncertain until the medical situation has been clarified. \"Ferdinand will see the doctor on Wednesday and so we don't know about him,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. It would be a welcome surprise if the centre-back was deemed in suitable condition for the trip to Skopje. There was, however, a pleasing civility in the dealings between club and country. Ferguson has occasionally been castigated for his reaction to call-ups for England, but his comments about Ferdinand were judicious when he might have curtly announced that the defender would have to be ruled out. Perhaps the meetings between club managers and Eriksson have generated some empathy. Ferguson has been co-operative at a stage when he might have been consumed by a grievance. The Scot was angry that Paul Scholes, with his groin condition well-known, was put through an hour's work against Croatia recently despite the irrelevance of the friendly to so experienced a player. While United still hope further surgery might be avoided Scholes is in no condition to turn out for any team in the immediate future. \"He is out for a month,\" Ferguson said. \"A specialist will look at him because he's had two hernias already. This is a third and may take longer to heal.\" If the manager suspects that England duty has aggravated the problem, he shows no signs of holding a grudge. Nicky Butt hurt an ankle in the friendly with Croatia and was expected to be out of action for at least another fortnight. Butt, however, was able to play the last 14 minutes against Southampton, opening the way for a return to the England squad. Eriksson will now have to assess the readiness of Butt and, with the aid of medical opinion, Ferdinand for an international game. Not even the uncertainty about the centre-back, however, could bring about an immediate recall for Gareth Southgate. The Middlesbrough defender, who turns 33 on Wednesday, had also been omitted from the party for the Croatia game. Even with Newcastle's Jonathan Woodgate unavailable after straining stomach muscles, Eriksson did not yield to the temptation to name Southgate. Should Ferdinand miss the journey to Skopje, it will be interesting to see whether the England coach chooses to call in the veteran or Birmingham's Matthew Upson. As Eriksson deliberates, he can be grateful that suspension preserved Sol Campbell from any harm in Arsenal's win over Manchester City yesterday. With the exception of the loss of Scholes, the coach finds that he is well-served in the midfield and attacking areas. Owen Hargreaves, who could not play against Croatia because of a groin strain, is fit once more. The resources for the forward line are altered only with the improvement of restoring Wayne Rooney to the squad now that he is back in action after his ankle problems. Eriksson has again had to do without Darius Vassell. He has suffered with pelvic injuries for some years but, as the new manager of Aston Villa, David O'Leary has decided to take action and an operation could follow. Had Vassell been available, James Beattie, the scorer of the winner against Manchester United, might have had the galling experience of being ditched before he has ever had much of a chance to prove himself with England. As it is, Eriksson has kept the squad as stable as possible. Ian Walker takes over from Chris Kirkland as third-choice goalkeeper. That may appear capricious, but the coach believes that Kirkland, who is not in the Liverpool side at present, would benefit from playing in the England Under-21 side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
