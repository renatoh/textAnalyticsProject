Konta, the first British woman to win this title since Sue Barker in 1977, played with accuracy and aggression to hustle the former Wimbledon champion out of her stride in the first set and, despite a dip in form in the second, she recovered well in the third. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an incredibly humbling experience,\u201d said Konta, who also beat Williams at the Australian Open. \u201cIt\u2019s a validation of all the hard work you\u2019ve already put in and a motivator on the things you want to keep improving on, and the lengths you might go to in order to become that much better at your discipline. \u201cI\u2019ve played her twice before and knew I\u2019d be playing a magnitude of experience. Venus Williams doesn\u2019t need an introduction, and I knew going into that I\u2019d need to stay focused on myself and to be really grateful for the experience and try to learn from her within the match.\u201d Konta paid tribute to Williams, who was looking for her 50th career title. \u201cQuite honestly, you\u2019d expect nothing less from a champion,\u201d Konta said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give away any match, much less a final. It was her 80th, so you could only imagine the number of different situations that she\u2019s already been in. \u201cIt was about keeping things in perspective, and understanding there\u2019d be ebbs and flows in the match. Every single point was a battle, and I tried to win as many battles as possible. The simpler you keep things, the more clarity you have, and the less dumb you play.\u201d After the first two games had gone with serve Konta broke Williams in the third. A powerful return took her to 15-40 and she completed the break with a clean winner after pinning her opponent on the baseline. Sending down her serves at more than 110mph, Konta\u2019s serve had been largely untroubled but in the 10th game Williams broke back. However, the world No18 responded in kind leaving her to serve for the set again and this time she made no mistake, winning the game to love. The second set began as the first, with Konta breaking Williams in the third game. She consolidated with some solid serving, finishing off with an ace, and made it a double break to lead 4-1 with Williams\u2019 serve looking increasingly shaky. However, Williams dug deep to recover one of the breaks and, with Konta pressing strongly, held her serve. Konta was beginning to make errors and Williams took advantage to break again and level the set at 4-4. At 4-5 and with her game creaking, Konta called her coach, Jos\u00e9-Manuel Garcia, on to court and his words seemed to have some effect as she managed to save two set points in the next game. However, Williams was not to be denied and on her third set point in the 12th game Konta sent the ball long. The start of the third set followed the pattern of the first two with Konta breaking Williams in the third game having squandered a chance in the first. She then moved 3-1 ahead with her 10th ace of the match. The next two games went with serve before Konta again exploited the frailty of the Williams serve to earn a second break and put her, at 5-2, on the verge of victory which, despite some signs of nerves and with Williams fighting to the last, she duly completed on her third match point after a tough final game. \u201cCredit to her for playing great tennis; she played so well and all of her balls were landing today,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my best day, but I tried to stay in there and fight, and that helped me get an opportunity to win the match. She played at such a high level today. She saved her best tennis for the final, which is what you want to do. \u201cShe plays really well against me, so maybe she comes out and doesn\u2019t feel any pressure and just swings for it. I tried to stay in there and fight. What can I say but give her credit.\u201d Serena Williams, meanwhile, has pulled out of the Rogers Cup starting in Montreal on Monday because of shoulder inflammation. \u201cDue to inflammation in my shoulder I unfortunately must withdraw from the Rogers Cup,\u201d Williams said in a statement. \u201cI was looking forward to competing in Montreal and I look forward to returning soon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
