The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) has said many companies will face fundamental change, including the phasing out of the UK\u2019s most polluting business activities. The government is to begin \u201cpurposefully disrupting\u201d industries to spur the move to a zero-carbon economy, after voting through the 2050 target this month. Jim Watson, a director at the UKERC, said many companies were not ready for deliberate government-led disruption. \u201cSome sectors are more ready than others,\u201d he said. \u201cThe electricity sector has already gone through a major change, for example, but other sectors are at the starting point and the government is going to have to be the disruptor here.\u201d He said companies involved in running the UK\u2019s gas networks, or working in the North Sea, may need to consider \u201can exit, or managed decline\u201d. The sectors facing the biggest shake-up include heating, transport and construction, according to the report. It says they face \u201cstarkly divergent futures \u2013 including futures where their core assets will need to be phased out\u201d. Prof Jillian Anable, a co-director at the UKERC, said it would prove \u201cpolitically challenging\u201d for ministers to deliberately disrupt companies, global trade networks, governance and lifestyles. The report identified gaping policy gaps in the government\u2019s plan to move to a zero-carbon economy. Researchers said ministers\u2019 own models provided only limited insights about the potential impact of a major shake-up to the economy. Anable said whole-scale changes were needed in the transport system, the largest carbon emitter in the UK economy. \u201cThe UK transport sector is nearly 100% fuelled by fossil fuels, with only tiny niches of electrified and bio-fuelled vehicles,\u201d she said. The government has already set a deadline for the sale of new traditional combustion engine cars to end by 2040. But hybrid vehicles, which are exempt from the ban, will need to be included in it for transport to be \u201ceffectively zero carbon\u201d by 2040. The transport sector made up 33% of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions last year. The UK\u2019s energy supply contributed 28%, while homes and business added 18% each. The report said the construction industry would also need to \u201cundergo disruptive change\u201d to deliver energy efficient building stock compatible with climate targets. But there was \u201clittle sign at present\u201d that the policies or skills were in place to retrofit the UK\u2019s draughty homes and businesses, the report said. \u201cRelated to this, it remains unclear what changes incumbent firms in heating will need to implement to deliver decarbonisation, and whether they will have the capacity to do so,\u201d the report added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
