The national team's failure to beat a 10-man Brazil in the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup rates as a low point in Eriksson's reign and Southgate, who brings his Middlesbrough team to Eastlands tomorrow, subsequently claimed that at half-time in Japan, with England losing 2-1: \"We wanted Winston Churchill and we got Iain Duncan Smith.\" Eriksson, who admits that the first-team coach Derek Fazackerley takes care of his instructions from the dugout because his voice is not strong enough, maintains he has never seen the benefit of shouting at his players and was as good as his word when faced with Southgate's comments. The Swede said: \"I don't know what he thinks and I'm really not interested in it. I will never be a Winston Churchill, I am who I am. I didn't do anything different during that half-time to what I normally do. What do you achieve by shouting? I can't scream, my voice isn't up to it, so I think if you want to tell your players something, you have to explain, tell them the reason, try to be constructive in what you say. When you play good football, no one argues; it's only when you lose a game people ask questions. But I won't change.\" Despite the criticism, Eriksson predicts a bright future for Southgate as a manager. \"He was always very curious as a player and he always wanted to know what you were doing and why. He is a good manager and can get better and better.\" Eriksson was also not concerned by the comments this week of Joey Barton. The former City player claimed that if it had not been for his efforts, and those of Richard Dunne and Micah Richards, the club may not have been in the Premier League and would therefore not have interested the new owner Thaksin Shinawatra or Eriksson. The Swede said: \"I didn't follow Manchester City last season but if that's the case, OK, thank you.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
