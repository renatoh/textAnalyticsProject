The coach lacked his usual combativeness after being invited to criticise some of the referee's decisions that went against his side, appreciating it was a performance of such basic ineptitude against opponents playing their third match on successive weekends, and their second in seven days, that he was not minded to champion the indefensible. Scotland are in Rome on Saturday for a fixture that will decide the destiny of the wooden spoon. They have won there only twice in six attempts in the Six Nations and, although they could take something from each of their previous five defeats, their defending in Dublin was shambolic. Every time they scored they bungled the restart and a mixture of poor organisation and weak tackling saw them concede three first-half tries. \"At this level you have to be able to hold your line; to concede in the way we did was really disappointing,\" said Robinson. \"We were very naive defensively and we were the cause of a lot of our problems. We have a lot of work to do this week if we are to win in Rome. Italy will be confident.\" Scotland have won two Six Nations matches in 14 under Robinson, but he would not appear to be in danger of the sack. All the defeats bar three having been in single figures, although two of those have come in the last three matches, and although Robinson has improved the focus, ambition and intent of his charges, Scotland's capacity to find different ways to lose remains unrivalled and they lack real quality in too many positions. Ireland, without both Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell in a Six Nations match for the first time since 2001, were hardly formidable. They eventually got on top in the set pieces and controlled the breakdown in the second half, where Stephen Ferris exerted a growing influence, but they will have to work considerably harder for tries against England at Twickenham on Saturday. At times it seemed as if the second-row Richie Gray was waging a one-man battle against Ireland. He scored Scotland's try, bullying his way through Eoin Reddan's tackle before putting the last line of defence, Rob Kearney, in three minds, and is his side's one world-class player, unfortunate, like Italy's Sergio Parisse, to be surrounded by so much mediocrity. \"It was our worst performance of the championship,\" said Gray, \"and we have a massive game on Saturday, well aware of the pressure that is on us. It is not a case of going back to the drawing board because we did well in our first three games, but sticking to what we have been doing and getting a performance.\" Robinson is under contract to 2015 and the Scottish Rugby Union could not afford to sack him if it wished, an unlikely prospect given the magnitude of the problems facing the Scottish game unless it is looking for a wand-waver: while Scotland have not finished bottom since 2007, the last time they won more than one match in a campaign was the previous year. The Scotland coach's pride will make him question whether he should carry on but he is not someone given to walking away. He is shaking up his coaching team at the end of the tournament: the attack coach, Gregor Townsend, is expected to take over from Sean Lineen at Glasgow next season and may be replaced by Scott Johnson while Graham Steadman, the defence coach, will be succeeded by Matt Taylor, a Scotland A international who is working with Queensland Reds. Scotland need an overhaul in attack and defence. They have passed the ball more often than any side this tournament but average only a try a game and have conceded nine in their past three outings. Gray's score on Saturday brought them back to 17-14 with less than two minutes of the first half left. All they had to do was secure the restart but Ireland seized possession and even after Jonathan Sexton kicked the ball harmlessly away Scotland made such an ordeal of clearing it that the home side had a final attacking opportunity, which Andrew Trimble took. The try deflated Scotland who, Gray apart, barely raised a whimper in the second period. \"Our performance in the last 40 minutes was unacceptable,\" said the prop Allan Jacobsen. \"I cannot explain it.\" Neither could Robinson, who was left cursing his luck when his side's one threatening break after the interval saw the wing Lee Jones knocked out by Trimble in a clash of heads as an overlap beckoned. Jones was released from hospital on Sunday but Scotland will need treatment for a while longer.
