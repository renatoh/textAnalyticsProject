The billionaire owner of Boohoo was speaking to the environmental audit committee \u2013 which is investigating the impact of fast fashion \u2013 in an appearance that represented his most substantive public questioning since the scandal emerged this summer. Repeatedly he said that his company was \u201ccommitted to making good\u201d. \u201cWe will make Leicester right, we will make things correct,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I promise you.\u201d At other times Kamani seemed dismissive of the idea that, as group executive chair and founder of the company estimated to have been buying 70-80% of Leicester\u2019s garment output, he had any personal responsibility for problems there. \u201cI cannot possibly know everything in this business, but I do know this is a priority in our business,\u201d he said. In an occasionally abrasive manner Kamani claimed that an independent report by Alison Levitt QC \u2013 which found that Boohoo was responsible for \u201cinexcusable\u201d failures, with a series of red flags being ignored, and prompted an apology \u2013 \u201cstated there was no wrongdoing on Boohoo\u2019s behalf\u201d. The hearing found that Boohoo, begun by Kamani in 2006, had exited 64 Leicester factories since late 2019 as it sought to reform its supply chain, with 400 unannounced audits carried out this year. But neither Kamani nor its group director of responsible sourcing, Andrew Reaney, would say how many of those cases were to do with low pay. Kamani sought to present himself as \u201ca market trader who had been very fortunate\u201d and learnt \u201cthe ethics of hard work\u201d from his father. He apologised if his inexperience of political questioning had led him to answer slowly or stutter. \u201cThe last 12 months have been very difficult for me, my family and my colleagues,\u201d he said. He later appeared to raise the possibility that more of Boohoo\u2019s business could be taken overseas if scrutiny of its UK supply chain became too onerous. \u201cFor us to move out of Leicester, it\u2019s very easy for us to take all our production offshore,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people in the fashion industry have moved offshore. We are still here and sometimes, sometimes, it feels like we get punished for it, just sometimes.\u201d With concerns among campaigners and industry sources that Boohoo was looking to move more of its supply base abroad, Kamani did not answer directly whether he had been looking to do this. \u201cWe are committed to Leicester,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully once we can work closely with factories, we\u2019ll hopefully increase our production and units in Leicester.\u201d He also defended a Black Friday sale where crop-top garments went on sale for 6p as effective PR. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re talking about it today means that that marketing worked,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
