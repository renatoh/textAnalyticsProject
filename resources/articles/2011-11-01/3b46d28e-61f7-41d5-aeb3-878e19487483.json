Do not read on if you haven't seen episode eight \u2013 and if you have seen further in the series, please be aware that many UK viewers have not. Paul Owen's episode eight blog This was an episode packed with great ideas. I loved Larry's tip to Leon that he could avoid racist snubs if he started wearing glasses, because \"white people revere black people in glasses\". The scenes in which Leon proved Larry's theory right were very enjoyable, and for the first time I felt there was some real affection and warmth growing between the two of them; Leon seemed to be evolving into a genuine friend for the first time. Another highlight this week was Larry's traumatic childhood memory of being thrown out into the street naked after playing strip poker with the daughter of a Mister Softee ice cream man. Those 1950s caricatures bawling with laughter as the young Larry tried to cover his modesty were just perfect: chomping on their cigars, their hair Brylcreemed back, clutching rolled-up newspapers on front stoops in vests and hats and playing cards on the lids of Top Cat-style bashed-up metal bins. It was an effortless recreation of the era in miniature from Larry and director Larry Charles. In the nicest possible way, it was also good to see Larry back in therapy, a rich vein the programme hasn't mined for some time. His indiscreet therapist was a lot of fun, telling Larry: \"I had a client, he was quite an illustrious, well-known director. I don't want to reveal who he was, but he did direct Star Wars ... And he enjoyed, in his repertoire of things that he liked, to see prostitutes ... \" An outraged Larry told him that anyone could work out he was talking about George Lucas, prompting the doctor to gently point out: \"Not everyone is in showbusiness, Larry ... \" Seinfeld-style, Larry now seems to be dating a different woman every week, and I loved the haunting notes of the aptly-named Mister Softee music preventing him performing in bed. On a related note, it was also great how Leon was kind of enjoying the vibrating car. And the episode ended with someone throwing a baby out of a burning building and someone else catching it - and you can't really go wrong with that. Larry in the right: It was outrageous of Jeff to refuse to give Larry half the chicken when they'd clearly agreed to split both meals. And I was glad Larry walked out of the minyan when one of its members started insulting his baseball-player pal Bill Buckner. Larry in the wrong: Obviously the therapist should not have been telling Larry about his other clients, but the doctor was well within his rights not to want to give Larry a few minutes' free consultation while they both waited in a queue. If it wasn't for Leon and his glasses, this might have been the most expensive \"stop and chat\" of all time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
