The defeat by the South Americans at Arena Corinthians, courtesy of two well-taken goals from Luis Su\u00e1rez, left the likes of Joe Hart in tears following on from Saturday\u2019s opening defeat by Italy in Manaus. While there is no great desire within the Football Association to remove Hodgson only two years into a four-year deal \u2013 the manager himself will not countenance thoughts of resignation \u2013 his tenure is now under scrutiny given the team\u2019s predicament at the foot of Group D. But he retains the backing of his squad. \u201cWe are going in the right direction,\u201d insisted Leighton Baines, who had emerged as the national side\u2019s first-choice left-back ahead of Ashley Cole under Hodgson. \u201cThere are some improvements to be made still but I think we have made some positive strides and if we can continue down that path we are going in the right direction. The manager has given everyone a go and you would imagine some of the young lads are going to be around for many, many years. Ross [Barkley] had some magic moments against Italy and Uruguay and he\u2019s going to be one of those who is going to be around for many, many more years. \u201cContinuing that progression [of the youngsters] will be a positive route to go. The easiest thing to do sometimes is to be critical and, with the position we are in, I suppose you have to accept that, up to a point. But there were some positives in both the games, even if we will only really see them maybe further down the line.\u201d That sentiment was echoed by an emotional Hart in the aftermath in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cFor me personally, and I think I speak for all the players, we are proud to play for Roy Hodgson,\u201d said the goalkeeper. \u201cHe\u2019s a great manager, he\u2019s a very passionate man and someone that I have got an awful lot of respect for, and I hope to continue playing for him.\u201d Asked if he thought the team had progressed over the past two years since Hodgson took up the reins before Euro 2012, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say [because] saying yes sounds like a stupid thing to say but I do. All this is so raw and hard to take but you have to accept it. We are at a World Cup and if we don\u2019t get results then stuff like this happens. \u201cBasically, we\u2019ve not scored enough goals and we\u2019ve let too many in. I imagine people will say we\u2019re not good enough, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll come up with, but we don\u2019t feel that inside the camp. We\u2019ve got bags of quality, bags of people coming through, great leaders and great experienced players in that dressing room but we\u2019ve just come up short in two games. And you can\u2019t come up short in two games at the World Cup. I\u2019ve actually not had a great deal to do in the two matches this tournament. I\u2019m man enough to say that but we are at the World Cup against top-quality strikers who, given half a chance, take it.\u201d Su\u00e1rez, even far from full match fitness, exploited indecision in the England back line to convert twice and pep Uruguay\u2019s prospects in the process. England\u2019s naivety \u2013 both in terms of the players out on the pitch and, arguably, the managerial approach from the sidelines \u2013 proved costly as they pushed for victory after Wayne Rooney\u2019s equaliser. Steven Gerrard acknowledged they had sought out a winner when a point would have actually enhanced their prospects of qualification. \u201cBut in the second half it just felt like we were going to win the game, to tell you the truth, especially when we got level,\u201d said Baines. \u201cIt was a real blow, with the goal they scored. To me, it felt like we were going to win the game. \u201cBut we all know Su\u00e1rez is world-class. He didn\u2019t put himself about as much as he normally would but he has the confidence in himself to know if he gets a chance he will take it \u2013 and he did. At the top level it is all about fine margins. On another day we could have probably come away having won that game. It is hard to sum it up really.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
