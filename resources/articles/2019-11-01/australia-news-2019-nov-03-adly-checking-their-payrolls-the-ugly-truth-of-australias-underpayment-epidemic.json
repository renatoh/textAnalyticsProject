Speaking to Guardian Australia this week after supermarket giant Woolworths admitted to underpaying staff by as much as $300m over almost a decade, Parker says it felt like big companies were coming forward almost weekly to declare their wrongdoing. Just don\u2019t call it a crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t accept the word crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cI am pleased companies are coming forward and are willing to rectify this issue.\u201d Crisis or not \u2013 and unions definitely think it is \u2013 the Woolworths case highlights a culture in Australian corporate management of failing to pay workers what they\u2019re due. At the top end of town, companies that have confessed to tens of millions in underpayments include Wesfarmers, Qantas, Commonwealth Bank, Super Retail Group and Michael Hill Jewellers. And then there are the likes of franchisees at convenience store chain 7-Eleven, who underpaid workers $160m as part of what was allegedly an entrenched system of deliberate rorting; the Made Establishment empire fronted by celebrity chef George Calombaris, which underpaid restaurant workers $7.8m; and a string of employers across the economy who have underpaid vulnerable migrant workers. Even the ABC, which has broken news about wage theft, and labour law firm Maurice Blackburn, which campaigns against it, have confessed to underpayments. Whether it\u2019s through apparent negligence, as in the case of Woolworths, or through deliberate wage theft, as at 7-Eleven, it has become obvious that underpayment is endemic across the economy. Corporations are on notice The Woolworths debacle has also shone a harsh light on an excuse beloved of corporate Australia: that the country\u2019s industrial relations system is just too complicated for hapless executives to comply with. If Woolies is able to track thousands of products from warehouses to stores scattered across the nation in near real time, how can complexity be to blame? Just as a multi-billion-dollar compensation bill has shocked bankers into taking seriously the risk posed by ripping off their customers, the rest of corporate Australia is now on notice that they need to tackle their underpayment problem. If they don\u2019t, they will face a wave of emboldened activist investors and a fed-up regulator that is grappling with its own credibility problem, as well as running foul of new laws proposed by the Morrison government. \u201cThey should know better and they should do better,\u201d Parker says of Woolworths. \u201cWhen I say disappointing, it\u2019s because I\u2019m pretty confident that they did all the other stuff right \u2013 the ordering of their products, knowing what\u2019s going on in their network, keeping tabs on their widgets. \u201cIt\u2019s almost cavalier in the sense that you don\u2019t put the effort in to make sure your greatest asset is getting paid properly.\u201d She has had 22 self-disclosures since the start of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s suddenly become a large number,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s weekly. I think the corporate sector has woken up and they\u2019re madly checking their payrolls.\u201d She accepts corporate contentions that Australia\u2019s award system, which sets 122 minimum pay rates for various occupations and has been in place since 1904, can be complicated \u2013 something unions dismiss. \u201cWhat I find pretty hard to cope with is these are often their own enterprise agreements that they\u2019re getting wrong, which are carefully negotiated line by line. \u201cThey have been lax and lazy and just let somebody else do it.\u201d She says the corporate influx is pushing her office towards becoming a corporate regulator, a \u201cbig change\u201d that requires a new set of skills. Does this mean she\u2019ll be asking for more money? \u201cWe\u2019ve had good support from the minister but I think it\u2019s fair to say the extent and complexity of these sort of disclosures is greater than we could ever have envisaged, our workload has significantly increased and we\u2019ll be looking at that,\u201d she says. In the meantime, she dismisses the persistent criticism from the union movement that her office has been unwilling to prosecute \u2013 criticism that sounds very familiar to anyone who\u2019s followed the troubles experienced by the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Parker isn\u2019t ready to follow Asic\u2019s lead and move to a \u201cwhy not litigate\u201d approach to demonstrate some steel. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a really good job, we\u2019ve got $40m recovered for workers last financial year,\u201d she says. \u2018We need to change the system\u2019 The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, wants penalties for underpayment beefed up and unions given back the right to check pay records, which they lost under the Howard government. She scoffs at the line that industrial law is too hard. \u201cSome of the companies in the hospitality sector, for example, which have been involved in the massive instances of wage theft in recent months, have multiple locations in different states, manage the complex logistics involved in supplying fresh food to those businesses, manage rental arrangements, marketing promotions \u2026 we simply don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s beyond the capability of these businesses to pay their workers correctly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of what businesses can do, but what they think they need to do, and what they think they can get away with. \u201cUnfortunately under the current system many businesses make the calculation that ripping off workers and getting caught will still be cheaper than paying them correctly in the first place. We need to change the system to shift that balance.\u201d The Woolworths debacle couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for corporate Australia, which has been lobbying against legislation proposed by the attorney general, Christian Porter, to make wage theft a crime \u2013 something the Morrison government has been dragged towards by the existing wave of public revulsion towards underpayment scandals. In an inadvertent demonstration of how much attitudes in corporate Australia need to change, industry body AI Group used a recent submission to a Western Australian inquiry into wage theft to complain that companies already \u201cdivert\u201d substantial resources into paying staff properly. \u201cWe could have worded that differently,\u201d Steve Smith, AI Group\u2019s head of industrial relations, says. \u201cBut the point we were making is that most businesses put a lot of resources into compliance.\u201d He is sticking to the line that it\u2019s all too complicated, even though his own body offers an advice service to help businesses figure out which of the 122 awards they are covered by. \u201cThere are hundreds if not thousands of issues that come up about how one award relates to another, how various penalties apply,\u201d he says. Calling in the auditors Former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels, who headed an inquiry into the exploitation of migrant labour and ran a compensation scheme for ripped-off 7-Eleven workers until he was sacked by the company, isn\u2019t buying the complexity excuse. \u201cThere is this view that the award system is too complicated, but while that\u2019s true the cases I\u2019ve seen involved people deliberately underpaying people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a widespread culture of substantial underpayment of temporary migrant workers \u2013 that is, students and backpackers \u2013 and that culture has nothing to do with awards being complex. They\u2019re a simple decision by business to underpay.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think Woolworths is in this category, but says it was \u201ca mistake and at worst a failure to give enough priority to making sure workers get paid\u201d. \u201cI do think nonetheless the Fair Work Ombudsman should probe deeply enough to determine what went wrong, having regard to the large amount involved,\u201d he says. He thinks the issue needs to be taken more seriously at the boardroom level \u2013 and beyond. \u201cCompliance programs may need to be wider in scope than just identifying egregious forms of wrongdoing,\u201d he says. \u201cI am also a little surprised the auditors didn\u2019t pick up this problem.\u201d Activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) also wants to know where the auditors have been. \u201cWe would raise questions about what the auditors are actually looking for and whether they are actually properly investigating the company,\u201d the ACCR\u2019s head of workers\u2019 rights, Katie Hepworth, says. The ACCR intends to expand its existing program of activism over exploitation in supply chains \u2013 such as fresh food, in the case of supermarkets \u2013 to cover directly employed staff. It has already asked to meet Woolworths over the underpayment debacle. And for the year ahead, she makes it clear that there is a spectre haunting corporate Australia \u2013 the spectre of wage underpayment. \u201cThere are significant gaps in corporate governance and it shows they haven\u2019t been looking at employee issues,\u201d she says. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s an area of massive corporate risk both in terms of reputation and the underpayments themselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
