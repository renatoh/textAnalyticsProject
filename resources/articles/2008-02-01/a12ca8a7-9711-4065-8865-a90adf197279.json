At a press conference in London's Dorchester hotel earlier this week he argued that the terrorist threat faced by the United Kingdom was largely a product of home-grown extremism rather than the (alarming number of) visits made by British citizens to the terrorist training camps so prevalent in the tribal areas of his country. But just a few days earlier, in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute, he warned his critics that failure to back him in his campaign against the terrorists in Pakistan would have its impact on the streets of Europe. Musharraf is right that Britain is producing thousands of radical extremists, two thousand of which are being monitored by security services because of their support for al-Qaida. But there is a great deal of difference between an individual supporting al-Qaida's goals and being ready and able to conduct a successful operation on its behalf. Look at the serious terrorist plots in Europe in recent years and in almost every case at least one cell member previously attended some form of terrorist training camp overseas. That surely is no coincidence. Today it is largely in the rarefied air of Pakistan's western mountains that al-Qaida is making skilled operatives out of the merely radicalised. Consider the UK's 2004 fertilizer bomb plot, when five British citizens sought to blow up targets around London. During their trial it emerged that despite their longstanding radical views it was only after attending an al-Qaida-sponsored, makeshift terrorist training camp in north-western Pakistan in the summer of 2003 (along with two of the July 7 bombers) that the group become serious about launching an attack in the UK. Not only were the rewards of martyrdom drilled into them, but they also learned how to make explosive devices step by step and then, just as crucially, test them. Contrary to some received wisdom, it is very difficult to make a bomb from scratch with instructions downloaded off the internet. In his Dorchester hotel remarks, Musharraf argued that Britain needed to find new ways to halt the spread of pro-al-Qaida extremism. He undoubtedly has a point, but dictatorial style rule, his recent tactic of choice, did not work out that well for that other soldier-politician, Oliver Cromwell, either. A better strategy would be to extend the pioneering work of the Metropolitan Police's Muslim Contact Unit to the rest of the UK. By patiently building up a partnership relationship with key sections of London's Muslim community, the Muslim Contact Unit has not only gained crucial intelligence on pro-al-Qaida extremists' activities in the capital, but also emboldened Muslim community leaders to themselves tackle the al-Qaida supporters. These efforts, together with tougher anti-terrorism legislation, have driven al-Qaida's supporters increasingly underground in London. But in Britain's provincial cities, radical zealots still operate all too freely among much more segregated Muslim neighbourhoods. Ultimately, as detective-inspector Robert Lambert, the outgoing head of the Muslim Contact Unit stressed to me recently, al-Qaida values dozens of operatives much more than hundreds of supporters. Despite all the support western governments have provided Pakistan's self-styled Lord Protector, graduates of al-Qaida's Pakistani training camps are currently being deployed in growing numbers on Europe's streets. In September, German authorities broke up a suspected al-Qaida plot to bomb Ramstein air force base and Frankfurt airport, involving three suspects, two of them German citizens, who trained in terrorist camps in Pakistan in late 2006. And just two weeks ago Spanish police broke up a plot targeting Barcelona's metro system, involving nine Pakistani nationals. Several of the plotters, including the alleged bomb maker, spent significant time in Pakistan in the months preceding their arrest. They were presumably not playing cricket. Preliminary reports by investigating authorities, obtained by the Spanish daily El Pais, indicate that the plot was directed by none other than Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban warlord, who the CIA believes ordered Benazir Bhutto killed in December. According to these documents, Mehsud planned to claim responsibility for the Barcelona attack on behalf of al-Qaida and then issue a set of demands which if not met would lead to follow-up attacks in Germany, France, Portugal and the UK. If Mehsud's graduation toward international terrorism is confirmed, it would throw Musharraf's failures to tackle the militants in Pakistan's tribal areas into sharper relief than ever. In 2005 the Pakistani government signed a peace deal with Mehsud in his south Waziristan stronghold in the hope that he would separate himself from al-Qaida. Instead he strengthened his position and appears to have put his considerable resources at al-Qaida's disposal. In an al-Jazeera interview that he taped in early December and that aired last week, Mehsud declared that he had the \"utmost love and respect\" for Osama bin Laden. And he had a message for western countries too: \"We want to eradicate Britain and America ... . Soon we will witness the miracles of jihad.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
