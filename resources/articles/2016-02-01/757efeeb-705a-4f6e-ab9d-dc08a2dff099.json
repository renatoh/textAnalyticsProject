But can he go big enough to shake the ramparts of castle Clinton? Hillary Clinton knows how to fight back \u2013 and she spent primary day greeting voters. \u201cWe have a new hashtag!\u201d one happy fan told her. \u201cNew HampsHER.\u201d Get it? Donald Trump, who slays in New Hampshire polls, said he\u2019d \u201cbe happy to win by one vote\u201d. Then, at a rally on Monday, he repeated a fan\u2019s appraisal of Ted Cruz: \u201cHe\u2019s a pussy.\u201d Cruz called Trump\u2019s remark \u201ccrude and profane\u201d. \u201cDonald doesn\u2019t handle losing very well and his typical response is to engage in insults,\u201d Cruz said. Perform too poorly in New Hampshire, and you\u2019re off the island. With polls showing four Republican candidates locked in a battle for second here, it\u2019s full-on Survivor time. Which name would you miss most from the 2016 race? Chris Christie? Carly Fiorina? The state can deliver a big boost, too \u2013 one that Ohio governor John Kasich is counting on. Groups backing dynast Jeb Bush have spent $$$ to tear down fellow Floridian Marco Rubio. A wasted effort here, it seemed \u2013 until Rubio\u2019s bad debate. Will Jeb triumph? Just getting started! Candidates ditch New Hampshire tonight for Nevada and South Carolina, which go next. Only 272 days left until November 8!"}, "isHosted": false}}}
