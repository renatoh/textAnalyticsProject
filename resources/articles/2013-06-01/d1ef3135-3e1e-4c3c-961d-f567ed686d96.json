His Gillard question was disrespectful", "bodyText": "\u201cThe standard you walk past is the standard you accept.\u201d That was part of what the chief of army, Lt Gen David Morrison told army members on Thursday night in a video message as he explained that if they felt it necessary to demean their female colleagues, or if they turned a blind eye to the demeaning behaviour of others, they should find another job. Morrison was responding to allegations that have been referred to the police. But his point about standards is broadly applicable. Howard Sattler\u2019s utterly disrespectful question to the prime minister about the sexuality of the man who has been her life partner for the past seven years was for many people so below any acceptable standard they simply could not walk past. The weaselly \u201cit\u2019s not me saying it ... you hear it \u2013 he must be gay, he\u2019s a hairdresser\u201d cop-out lines just made it worse. But many people have been \u201cwalking past\u201d escalating vitriol, not to mention wilful inaccuracies, from some radio announcers for a long, long time. Over on 2GB Alan Jones (he of \u201cput her in a chaff bag, take her out to sea and dump her\u201d and her father must have \u201cdied of shame\u201d infamy) was busy lambasting the prime minister\u2019s \u201cblue ties\u201d speech this week. I think there are some legitimate questions to ask about that speech. There might be only two women in the shadow cabinet, but their presence surely means women\u2019s voices won\u2019t be completely \u201cbanished\u201d in an Abbott government. And it\u2019s unclear how abortion law would become a \u201cplaything\u201d of men under the Coalition when both major parties have both pro-choice and pro-life MPs and Abbott has said he won\u2019t change federal law, especially since he has now also promised not to do deals with DLP senator John Madigan. But Jones was not asking questions. He wasn\u2019t even just stating a view. He was, as usual, venting. In fact, he was calling the prime minister sick, irrational and evil. Her speech, he told his listeners, proved Gillard was \u201cso consumed with jealousy and anger and hatred that rationality has abandoned her thinking\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Julia Gillard has reached the end of the road. She is either ill, with envy, jealous envy, anger and humiliation or she is a seriously evil woman ... Forget misogyny, this woman by her speech yesterday is a misanthrope, a hater of men,\u201d he said. \"Anyone visiting the country would believe that this was a person who is seriously in need of emotional and psychological help \u2026 I\u2019ve said many times and I say it again, there is no limit to the depths to which this woman will sink in order to save herself.\" It went on, and on. Jones is free to express his views. But listeners, to him, to Sattler and to the rest of the venting shock jocks around the nation, need to decide whether they want to \u201cwalk past\u201d when they hear questions such as Sattler\u2019s, or statements such as Jones\u2019s that the prime minister of the country is \u201cseriously evil\u201d. Some already have taken a stand. But everyone who finds a comment offensive, below a reasonable standard of debate or questioning, and continues to walk past, helps acceptance of the unacceptable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
