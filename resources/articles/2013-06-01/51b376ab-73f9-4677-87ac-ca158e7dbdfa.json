Chuck Schumer wanted 70 votes, and except for those delays, he may well have gotten them. Whether it's 67 or 70 votes, however, this will be a tough slog in the House. At the moment, it's very difficult to see a modified form of this framework passing the House with a majority of Republicans in support - the condition speaker John Boehner set for bringing the bill to the floor. The senate is expected to vote on final passage of the bill later this week. Thanks for joining us. Republican Lamar Alexander made it, and votes aye. Five left. Rand Paul votes no. Four left. **And that's all they'll allow. They're calling it. Something interesting is going on here, if you've missed the last half-hour. The motion already has 66 yes votes, so it would pass. But due to flight delays affecting a number of senators, the vote is being kept open. The bill's proponents want 70 votes, and they could get it, but for those pesky flight delays. Having 66 votes instead of 70 - on a procedural measure - probably wouldn't be the deciding factor in whether the House decides to take it up eventually, but they don't want to take any chances. So, we get this slightly bizarre state of events. A plane got stuck in the mud, at the airport. Oh. Let's get a move on, fellas... If this is the case, let's end the vote: Corker and other proponents, as we said, want as many yes votes as possible. Hence the endless delay. Some yes votes from the Republicans so far: Ayotte, Chiesa, Collins, Corker, Flake, Graham, Hatch, Heller, Hoeven, Kirk, McCain, Murkowski, Rubio, Wicker. Not many surprises there. A good number of the Republican leaners have been voting no so far. Byron York thinks it's a going to come in a bit lower than the 68-71 Reid was counting on: On the other hand, red-state Democrats up for reelection Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu have voted yes, so the number could be closer to the upper 60s. Of course we could just wait until they announce the final tally, but what fun would that be? We'll have an update on some of the more interesting votes and a final tally shortly. The vote is beginning. Senator Richard Burr is not impressed: Cruz also brought cartoons, for his speech: Corker is back on now, briefly, trying to read more from the CBO report from his BlackBerry. He gives up. \"I can't read from my BlackBerry.\" Freshman Ted Cruz, who for some reason is given floor time at the end of every debate to run his mouth, is speaking. He brings up the common complaint that there was not enough time given to read the bill. Schumer interrupts, is given a minute to speak, and responds that senators had the whole weekend to read it. He says this is plenty of time to read 100 pages of legislative text. Cruz responds that it is very complex, the legislative process. Bob Corker is up now offering a last pitch for his amendment. He refers to it as a \"$46 billion investment.\" Also, in a shot to some of his colleagues: \"I know there are people who are going to vote against this bill no matter what it says.\" Senator David Vitter, a \"no,\" is just a laugh riot: For approximately the billionth time, senator Chuck Schumer notes that he can see the Statue of Liberty from his apartment in Brooklyn. The congressional budget office (CBO) still doesn't have a specific number estimate of how Hoeven-Corker would affect net illegal immigration flow, but it has something: Opponents are seizing on this, too: So in case you're keeping score: opponents consider CBO scores important at the moment; if a favorable CBO score were to come out, they would likely revert to total disdain of CBO methodology in general. Senator Coburn is on the floor. He \"readily admits\" that if he lived in some poor Central American country he'd do everything he wanted to get inside the United States. But then he'd be a lawbreaker. Yes that is true Tom Coburn, missed the point though. Both he and Senator Cornyn before him are lamenting that someone with a drunk-driving violation could still get \"registered provisional immigration\" status. (Those with three or more cannot.) Here's the Washington Post's rough whip count: 51 yes, 10 likely yes, 3 \"potentially yes,\" 15 undetermined, 12 likely no, 9 no. (Another way to read that is 91 \"potentially yes\" or 49 \"potentially no,\" we guess? What do we know.) This is Jim Newell in Washington. This afternoon we'll be covering a Senate vote to cut off debate on the Hoeven-Corker border security amendment to comprehensive immigration reform. This was the border security deal brokered late last week to break the immigration gridlock in the Senate. It is expected to easily surpass the 60 votes needed to proceed today. Proponents of the bill \u2013 mostly Democrats, but a significant number of Republicans as well \u2013 hope that the margins on this vote and the final vote on the immigration package later in the week are as wide as possible, to entice House speaker John Boehner to take up the measure. Hoeven-Corker was an attempt to call anti-CIR Republicans' bluff on border security. After demanding stronger border security measures for their support, these Republicans got just that in the amendment: a doubling of border patrol agents from 20,000 to 40,000, and additional 350 miles of border fencing, a tripling of surveillance drones from 6 to 18, and more. This amendment, essentially, shows which opponents were serious in their demands for more border security, and which were using it as an excuse to torpedo the overall package. Many big-name Senate Republicans, including Rand Paul, John Cornyn, Chuck Grassley, and Ted Cruz remain opposed to the package. The vote begins at 5.30pm. We'll be following the Senate debate and other news leading up to the vote until then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
