Still, the course laid out last week by the Capital Times is such a break with everything that has come before that its success - or failure - may tell us a lot about whether journalism as we know it can evolve and survive. As of April 30, the Times, a six-days-a-week afternoon broadsheet with a paid circulation of about 17,000, will shift most of its distribution to the internet. The broadsheet will cease to exist. Instead, a free tabloid containing news and opinion will be published each Wednesday, and a free arts-and-entertainment tab will come out on Thursdays. The new print products are expected to reach some 80,000 readers through newsstands and as an insert in the Madison-area edition of the much larger Wisconsin State Journal, a morning paper that is owned by the same company as the Capital Times. But the emphasis is on the internet. In a recent interview with Poynter Online, Dave Zweifel, the longtime editor who's moving into semi-retirement as editor emeritus, said the goal is to provide readers with a continually updated website staffed by a newsroom that will be active seven days a week and at least 18 hours a day. The move will not come without pain. The newsroom staff of 60 - unusually large for a paper the size of the Capital Times - will reportedly be cut by about 20 positions. The decision to shift mostly to web distribution also must have been made rather hastily, as the paper underwent an extensive redesign just a few months ago. But, then, businesses don't embrace radical new methods of reaching their customers when they're fat and happy. The Capital Times, a legendary paper in Wisconsin's left-leaning progressive tradition, began life toward the end of the first world war. Now, faced with extinction, its managers propose to keep their paper alive by keeping the journalism while jettisoning the package that has carried that journalism for the past 90 years. If the transition is to work, then the Capital Times must find a way to overcome an enormous hurdle - the fact that online advertising is not nearly as lucrative as print advertising. A gloomy assessment of the newspaper business published in the New York Times last week included the mind-boggling statistic that an internet reader brings in just 5% as much ad revenue as a print reader. Yet the same article noted that online distribution has enabled newspapers to reach more readers than ever before. The good news for publishers is that people want what they're giving them. If someone could figure out how to fix the business model, then the rest ought to fall into place. One of the biggest problems facing traditional newspapers is that they must continue to prop up what is essentially a large-scale manufacturing business - converting trees into newspapers, and then distributing those newspapers - while making the transition to online delivery. The Capital Times, by contrast, will save a bundle of money by eliminating most of its printing and delivery costs while retaining the advantage of having some print advertising. This hybrid model may prove to be the most elegant solution for newspapers during the next few years, as they use their print editions mainly to drive traffic to their websites and to capture some ad revenue that would not otherwise be available. Five or 10 years down the road, the print editions may cease to exist altogether. The Capital Times website needs some work. At the moment, readers are not able to comment on all stories. The ability to share content via social-networking tools such as Digg and del.icio.us seems to be limited to the Times' blogs. The paper is going to have to get this stuff right if it's to succeed. Still, at a moment when too many newspaper publishers spend most of their time wringing their hands, it's exciting to see a paper whose executives have embraced the future. This experiment bears watching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
