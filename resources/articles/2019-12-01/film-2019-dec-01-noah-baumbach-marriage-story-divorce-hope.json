Kicking and Screaming (1995) is about a group of college pals who refuse to move on with their lives. While We\u2019re Young (2014) is about a friendship between a middle-aged documentary-maker and his wife, and a couple in their 20s. The Meyerowitz Stories (2017) is about siblings attempting to live in the shadow of their egomaniacal artist father. But for some of us, he really has only one true subject: D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Consider the best movies of his career so far, made almost 15 years apart: The Squid and the Whale (2005), the bittersweet picture that first brought him to most people\u2019s attention, is about divorce, and so, too, is Marriage Story, his hotly Oscar-tipped new film. To pinch from Philip Larkin, separation is to Baumbach what daffodils were to Wordsworth. Not that he sees it quite like this. When we meet in a clattering New York restaurant on a cold, bright autumn morning, Baumbach is annoyingly keen to resist my passionately held theory that people whose parents split up when they were children (him, me) grow up to be somewhat preoccupied by divorce, a fascination that will probably end (at least in my case) only with death. \u201cYes, both those films are about divorce,\u201d he says, in his careful, rather ponderous way. \u201cThe Squid and the Whale from the kids\u2019 perspective, and Marriage Story from that of the adults. But what they also provide narratively is the opportunity to talk about other things.\u201d I stare at him. What other things? What can he possibly mean? \u201cWell, Squid is about family,\u201d he says, with the kind of patience a therapist might reserve for a particularly anxious patient. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the necessary movement away from our parents, whether divorced or not, and their conscious or unconscious tugging back [of us]. And although Marriage Story is about the disintegration of a marriage, it enables you to look at marriage itself, too.\u201d Both films, he insists, are surprisingly hopeful, in spite of what I regard as all the evidence to the contrary. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he tells me, reassuringly. \u201cThey\u2019re really about starting again.\u201d Baumbach, who is a boyish 50, has the kind of hairstyle that manages somehow to be both long and short, and the kind of clothes that pull off the rare feat of appearing both pin-neat and artfully dishevelled. He looks, in other words, like a cross between a university lecturer and an assistant in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. He also looks exhausted. The shadows under his eyes match the navy of his boiled wool blazer; he clings to his coffee cup as if to a life buoy. But this is hardly surprising. His schedule appears to be quite mad. This morning, I was woken at 5am by a message informing me that our encounter might be off because he was going to have to fly at short notice to Los Angeles to appear in a Q&amp;A at a film festival \u2013 and, in fact, when he leaves here that\u2019s exactly what he will be doing. Even as we speak, a frazzled PR is standing at the door, stopwatch in hand. \u201cThis has been going on since Venice in late August,\u201d he says. Not that he\u2019s complaining. He could hardly be more gracious: \u201cWhen you finish something, you don\u2019t come out of the gate with a fully formed idea of what you\u2019ve done. In a way, I feel talking about the movie, and hearing what other people think about it, helps me to understand it better myself.\u201d The beauty of a film like Marriage Story, he thinks, is that people bring their own stuff to it, and thus the conversations he has about it tend to be as much about life as about the film itself. But in any case, irrespective of the demands of producer/distributor Netflix, which clearly hopes Marriage Story is going to win it an Oscar, I think he feels a certain duty of care. When he was growing up, lots of people used to make films like his: interior dramas (though his movies undoubtedly have their blackly funny moments, they can hardly be accurately described as comedies) starring east coast liberal intellectual types with extensive bookshelves, subscriptions to the New Yorker and complicated emotional lives. Nowadays, though, they\u2019re increasingly a rarity. He is determined to do his best to \u201carticulate something that is essentially inarticulate by design\u201d to the press and to festival audiences alike. In Marriage Story, Scarlett Johansson plays Nicole, an actor, and Adam Driver her estranged husband, Charlie, a perfectionist director of edgy off-Broadway theatre. We know that Nicole and Charlie were once madly in love \u2013 as the film opens, we hear Charlie describing all the things he adored about her when they first met \u2013 but somewhere along the way, their relationship has broken down. Having previously turned her back on Hollywood in favour of working in New York with Charlie\u2019s theatre company, Nicole has now returned to LA with their eight-year-old son, Henry, to star in a TV series. The film depicts not only the couple\u2019s increasingly toxic custody battle \u2013 it comes with brilliant turns from Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta, all of whom play divorce lawyers of varying degrees of rapaciousness, and from Mary Hollis Inboden as a terrifyingly silent family court representative \u2013 but also its subtle effects on their sense of identity. It is in some ways a movie about power. As Nicole grows ever stronger, her world expanding, her voice becoming louder and more confident, Charlie is ever quieter and more fragile. On Halloween, when he dresses up as the invisible man, the bandages he wraps around his face speak volumes. It\u2019s as if he is determined to erase himself before someone else does. Can Baumbach remember the tug on the line that was the beginning of this film? \u201cIt really isn\u2019t possible to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026 these things are garnered all the time. I often have a lot of\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t even call them ideas. Sometimes, they\u2019re ideas, but it can also be an atmosphere, a line, a relationship, a location. These things are in a notebook, and in my head, and then they keep finding their way back to whatever I\u2019m working on. Something will return, and I won\u2019t know where to put it. It will keep bouncing around until, at a certain point, it\u2019s like the electrical current in a dead wire suddenly goes on \u2013 and then that wire is the one, and I start looking at it in a way that I wasn\u2019t before. When I started writing this movie \u2013 well, the actual writing was probably only six months or something, but all the stuff that went into it you can\u2019t quantify.\u201d So in the beginning, he\u2019s basically a kind of ambulant whiteboard? He smiles. \u201cYes. In this case, I was working on The Meyerowitz Stories and things got auditioned in that script, and then they got kicked out, and then they found their way into this one.\u201d Aware that a film about a custody battle might be gruelling, he knew it was vital that the audience have a sense of Nicole and Charlie\u2019s former happiness: hence the early scene \u2013 an extended flashback \u2013 during which Charlie lists his wife\u2019s virtues. \u201cI wanted that to feel very immediate and intimate and active, knowing that very soon it was all going to be destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience need that memory for perspective. I wanted people to feel as though they had been inside this family, however embarrassing that might be \u2013 because after this, the journey is into all these sterile office environments and courtrooms. We\u2019re going to be wrenched out of home life. In fact, the notion of home life is going to be completely redefined.\u201d Baumbach went through a separation himself some years ago; he and Jennifer Jason Leigh, with whom he has a son, Rohmer (named after the French film director Eric Rohmer), divorced in 2013; he now lives with Greta Gerwig, the actor and director, with whom he has a new baby (they met in 2010, when she starred in his film Greenberg, though their relationship did not begin until later). To what degree, then, is Charlie a version of himself? \u201cHe\u2019s not me any more than Nicole is,\u201d he says. And whose side is the film on? Some people think that Nicole fades from view; that in the end, it comes down, for whatever reason, on Charlie\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that view. But if anything, this movie only illustrates that to take sides at all is folly. When it begins, we\u2019re with her: we\u2019re in LA, where she grew up, with her mum and her sister. She\u2019s telling her story. But then he turns up, and we drift into his. I feel like the job of the last part of the movie is to say: it\u2019s all true, and none of it\u2019s true. These are just people trying their best. Her story is one of momentum, rebuilding and finding her voice, and his is a story of breaking down; it\u2019s a kind of role reversal, because he\u2019s a director and she\u2019s an actor \u2013 not that I want to stereotype those roles. But I also think that her monologue and his song at opposite ends of the movie are mirror images of something: in a way, both of them find their voice.\u201d The song in question is Being Alive, from Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Company. Charlie sings it in a bar, with exquisite sincerity and immense feeling, watched by members of his theatre company, and it\u2019s extraordinary: an epiphany that seems to come out of nowhere, and somehow puts a bow around the whole film. Baumbach nods: \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that you needed it, right?\u201d This is true, but it also raises the question: how did he know that I needed it? For a few moments, he tries to explain \u2013 something about avatars and voices and perspective \u2013 but in the end, perhaps it simply comes down to this. Driver loves that song, and its lyrics speak to one of the film\u2019s themes, which has to do with the fact that just as familiarity can breed contempt, perhaps one can only feel truly alive when one is absolutely loved and seen (\u201cSomebody pull me up short/And put me through hell/And give me support\u201d). Anyway, it\u2019s perfect. That was the moment when, sitting there in the dark, something inside me gave way, and my eyes filled with tears. Why does Baumbach think people get married at all \u2013 especially people like us, whose parents failed at it several times? \u201cOh, boy.\u201d Looking agonised, he puts his forehead in his hand. \u201cUm, um \u2026 Well, why wouldn\u2019t people get married? It\u2019s a very\u2026 hopeful, very\u2026 brave thing, getting married. It\u2019s great that people want to do that. It\u2019s a great act of hope. It\u2019s\u2026 romantic. Perhaps it has to do with repair as well: that\u2019s something we\u2019re all doing, in our different ways. Whatever our family damage is, repair takes a lot of forms.\u201d Can those who have been through a painful divorce \u2013 though not all divorces are, or need to be, painful \u2013 ever recover from the experience? \u201cIt\u2019s like any childhood event or trauma \u2026 it\u2019s up to us. As the Wallace Shawn character says [Shawn plays an actor in Charlie\u2019s company who functions as an occasional Greek chorus]: it\u2019s going to be horrible, but it\u2019s also going to be over.\u201d A pause. \u201cThough as we know, it keeps going, too.\u201d Baumbach grew up in Brooklyn, the older son of the novelist Jonathan Baumbach (who was married four times) and Georgia Brown, a film critic at the Village Voice (she was Jonathan\u2019s third wife). He was 14 when his parents separated. He remembers it vividly. He went out to watch Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in Romancing the Stone, having been warned that when he got home there was going to be a family meeting \u2013 a scene he reprises beautifully in the semi- autobiographical The Squid and the Whale, in which Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels play a version of his parents \u2013 and he knew perfectly well what that meant: \u201cI watched the movie with some sense of dread, though I guess it took me out of my head for a while.\u201d He began to cry even before his parents announced their complicated custody arrangements (in the interests of fairness, the two boys would visit their father every Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, and every other Thursday). Has he seen Romancing the Stone since, or are the glorious adventures of Turner and Douglas in the Colombian jungle forever ruined for him? He laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen it for years. But I liked it at the time. Doesn\u2019t Michael Douglas end up in a boat on Central Park South or something?\u201d Did he always know that he wanted to make films? \u201cI had, at least, the dream. I didn\u2019t know anyone in film, so I didn\u2019t know it was possible. I wanted to do it, and I would say that I wanted to do it, but there was a second voice in my head that said: well, how would that even happen? But I did a lot of plays, and wrote stories, and when VHS happened, I got a camcorder and lugged that around. VHS was amazing. You could watch movies at home, and you didn\u2019t have to wait till Easter to see The Wizard of Oz or whatever.\u201d Did it help that his parents led creative lives? \u201cIt did, and they loved movies, too.\u201d He has said that his father took him to see Truffaut\u2019s The Wild Child when he was just five, or thereabouts. \u201cI was lucky to have them as an example, though it also created its own burdens and challenges. I guess film, for me, was both a kind of inheritance, and a way of doing something different [from them].\u201d Baumbach studied English at Vassar College, where he wrote, directed and acted in plays, but made no movies, largely on account of the fact that its film department had no decent equipment. How, then, did it happen that he came to release his first film, Kicking and Screaming, when he was only 26? He shakes his head. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a good story. Except to say that I\u2019d worked on a script, and I had two good friends who were my housemates in senior year, Jason Blum and Jeremy Kramer, who are both still in films, and the three of us would give it to anyone we could. Again, we had no idea how it worked, and it fell apart many times, even in pre-production. It was so random. The video company involved threatened to pull out at one point, and I had to write the part Eric Stoltz plays at the last minute to get it financed. His character was just slapped on.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI was in LA, and I felt so old, and yet I was so young. I just thought it was all too good to be true.\u201d And in a way, it was. A second film, Mr Jealousy, followed, after which there was a quite long period of silence. \u201cYeah. What happened? It was hard for me. I went through this time after Mr Jealousy: I\u2019d had this early opportunity, and then I was having trouble getting anything made. I was writing pilots, things like that. I was staying busy and making a living, but not the living I wanted. I began to wonder: am I a film-maker? Will I ever make another one? I didn\u2019t think about quitting, but it was really difficult. What I ended up doing was working on myself. I went into therapy. I grew up a bit. I started to understand myself better, and because of that I started to write and think more creatively. Then I wrote The Squid and the Whale. I had a breakthrough. It was a case of: I\u2019m not the film-maker I thought I was.\u201d The other thing that helped was his friendship with the film-maker Wes Anderson, with whom he wrote The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004) and Fantastic Mr Fox (2009). \u201cWe were both friends with [the director] Peter Bogdanovich, and we would hear about each other. We finally met at a John Waters premiere in 1998; afterwards, we ended up at a bar in Soho called Toad Hall. We started talking, and we realised we shared a lot of likes: when we exchanged numbers, we realised we both had the same kind of notebook in our pockets. He was making The Royal Tenenbaums, and just watching how he did it was so inspiring to me. His work ethic, his precision.\u201d Anderson went on to co-produce The Squid and the Whale. \u201cA lot of film-makers are nice,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it can be tough. Directing is lonely. Mike Nichols said a director always needs a buddy, and that\u2019s wise: to have a producing partner, or a writer. Though if you write and direct, obviously you don\u2019t have a writer.\u201d These days, however, he has Gerwig, with whom he wrote two films, Frances Ha and Mistress America. \u201cThe press part is harder, because we\u2019re on different schedules. But in terms of the rest of it, for us, it\u2019s nice.\u201d Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women, starring Meryl Streep and Saoirse Ronan, opens at Christmas. He beams. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great. When you see it, you\u2019ll realise immediately. You\u2019ll think: of course, this is why she did it.\u201d For his own part, he has no idea what he\u2019ll do next. \u201cI was with Adam [Driver] last night, having the conversations we tend to have: how about this? How about that?\u201d All he knows is that he and Driver, who have become close in spite of the 14-year age gap between them, will certainly work together again in the future. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s always alive as an actor to the particular moment.\u201d Baumbach only wants, he says, to go with what he\u2019s doing right now. \u201cThe whole process is a conversation with my younger self, who so loved movies.\u201d He won\u2019t \u2013 he can\u2019t \u2013 take it for granted. \u201cYou\u2019re at Venice, or somewhere, and something happens, and it\u2019s so exciting, and all you want to do is check in with your 17-year-old self who, had he known what was coming, would have thought it so cool.\u201d Noah\u2019s arc: the best of Baumbach, by Guy Lodge Kicking and Screaming (1995) Aged just 26, Baumbach made his debut with this modestly scaled but spiky ensemble piece following a group of college graduates all struggling to start the next phase in their lives. Made with a script endorsed by Steve Martin, it earned Baumbach a pile of \u201cnames to watch\u201d notices, though his true breakthrough would take another decade. The Squid and the Whale (2005) Now thematically bookended by Marriage Story, this mordantly funny divorce drama starred a peak-form Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as warring literary spouses and was inspired by Baumbach\u2019s parents\u2019 split. It was the director\u2019s fourth film, but it announced his name to a wider audience, scoring him his only Oscar nomination to date. Margot at the Wedding (2007) Reviews were chilly for Baumbach\u2019s follow-up to the success of The Squid and the Whale, but this piquant study of a successful, narcissistic writer descending on her estranged sister\u2019s Long Island wedding festivities gets too little credit. Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh give exquisite performances and there\u2019s hard humanity under the sour surface. Frances Ha (2012) Baumbach\u2019s collaboration with Greta Gerwig began with the droll LA story Greenberg, but it blossomed in this vibrant, New Wave-styled character study of a young would-be dancer in personal, professional and even residential limbo. Co-written with Gerwig, and shot in gorgeous, grainy black and white, it\u2019s less jaded and more joyful than his previous work. Marriage Story (2019) Fourteen years after making drama from his parents\u2019 divorce, Baumbach gives the same treatment to his own split from Jennifer Jason Leigh, following Adam Driver\u2019s New York theatre director and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s LA-native actor through the travails of a bicoastal separation. Brutally close to the bone and sometimes raucously comic, it\u2019s earned the best reviews of his career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
