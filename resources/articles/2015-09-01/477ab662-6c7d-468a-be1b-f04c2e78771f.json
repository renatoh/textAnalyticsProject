I\u2019m not sure what the right response is to that,\u201d she says, laughing. As her term at the Human Rights Commission draws to a close, Broderick insists that it is the small, seemingly inconsequential interactions that keep her going. She talks of a 60-year-old police officer in Hobart who approached her after a speech to say that hearing made him believe that gender equality existed. Those exchanges, she says, are energising and encourage her to go on. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey characterised by persistence \u2026 not one giant leap,\u201d she says of obtaining gender equality. Her advice to her successor, who has not yet been announced, is simple. \u201cDo what you can, when you can,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t respond to the barbs. Have a thick skin.\u201d Before being appointed as commissioner in 2007, Broderick worked as a partner at a multinational law firm. In 2014, at the launch of an initiative to combat sexual harassment, Broderick spoke of her own experience as a young lawyer. An older client repeatedly asked her out, making her increasingly more uncomfortable. \u201cLike most cases of workplace sexual harassment, common elements exist \u2013 a significant power imbalance, an inability to tell management, embarrassment, shame, the positive intervention of bystanders and most importantly, I stopped enjoying a job I otherwise loved,\u201d she said at the May 2014 launch. \u201cUntil people know where the line is, and know what comments, behaviour and language cross this line, we\u2019re not going to be able to have a fully informed, national discussion about this issue.\u201d Broderick is most proud of the cultural change she has been able to enact in workplaces in her time as commissioner. Overcoming \u201cgender asbestos\u201d, where unconscious bias is \u201cbuilt into the walls and ceilings\u201d of big organisations is everyone\u2019s job, and gains have already been made, she says. The creation of a national paid parental leave scheme \u2013 elements of which the Coalition government is now trying to unwind \u2013 is a particular source of pride for Broderick. She has criticised the plan to stop primary caregivers from accessing both government and employer schemes as regressive and incompatible with human rights. \u201cI hope that we will see the scheme [continue] in its current form,\u201d she says. The government argues that parents who access both schemes are \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d, while the social services minister, Scott Morrison, dismissed paid parental leave as a \u201cfirst world issue\u201d that should not dominate the government\u2019s policy agenda. Broderick warns that people of influence should be mindful of the language they use. \u201cThe way we describe things is important and it sends a message about the role of women in society.\u201d In 2011 Broderick tackled one of the most macho organisations in the country \u2013 the armed forces. She was tasked with undertaking a review of the treatment of women in the defence forces, following the so-called Skype sex scandal at the Australian Defence Force Academy, when a male cadet filmed himself having sex with a female cadet and shared it without her knowledge. Since then, the army has made gains in gender equality, though the organisation started from a low base. The newly retired chief of army, David Morrison, who commissioned the review, labelled the Skype scandal a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that sparked unstoppable change. \u201cI can guarantee you that the momentum for change is now unstoppable,\u201d he said late last year. Broderick says it was a \u201cprivilege\u201d to work with the military. \u201cAustralia is really advanced in recognising that the treatment of women goes to [defence] capability,\u201d she says. Despite the gains made in some aspects of Australian society, Broderick acknowledges there is still a lot of work to be done. She has advocated strongly for the implementation of quotas for both businesses and in politics. That is a fight she is unlikely to win, with senior \u2013 mostly male \u2013 figures in the Coalition government rejecting the push for both targets and hard quotas. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in quotas and I don\u2019t believe in targets but I do believe in people being elected on the basis of merit,\u201d the leader of the House of Representatives, Christopher Pyne, told ABC\u2019s 730 program in July. Only two cabinet ministers \u2013 the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the health minister, Sussan Ley \u2013 are women. \u201cWomen\u2019s voices are still missing [at the top],\u201d Broderick says \u2013 of both politics and managerial roles in business. She wishes she could have done more to stop the scourge of domestic violence; an average of two women a week are being murdered at the hands of male partners or family members. \u201cThat\u2019s truly unacceptable,\u201d the commissioner says. Though she is leaving her role and the public platform it gives her, Broderick is pledging to continue her fight for equality. Her next move will involve working on a small number of \u201chigh-impact\u201d roles that \u201celevate women\u2019s voices\u201d. The federal government has not yet announced who will fill the vacancy. A spokesman for the attorney general, George Brandis, told Guardian Australia that the government \u201cwill make an announcement on the sex discrimination commissioner, but we don\u2019t have anything to announce at the moment\u201d. The spokesman acknowledged that there had been a \u201chuge amount of speculation\u201d that the role would not be filled to make way for different rights portfolios, but he would not be drawn on whether or not these reports were accurate. Broderick\u2019s last day in the job will be Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
