Then they grew into today's retail behemoths, making mincemeat of said candlestick maker and friends. Between 1995 and 2000 we lost one-fifth of our local shops and services. Now 80 per cent of our food comes from the big four: Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Morrisons. Analysts predict the independent shop could be extinct by 2050. It begs the question: where has all the choice gone? For every \u00a38 spent by a UK consumer, \u00a31 goes to Tesco. Asda is owned by Wal-Mart, the largest company on the planet, which uses its tremendous global purchasing power to drive down prices. Its ethical credentials are, to put it mildly, questionable. The Los Angeles Times ran a Pulitzer prize-winning series of articles connecting Wal-Mart to union bashing, sweatshop labour and poverty wages. Supermarket buyers seem to have more clout than Tony Soprano. Just 110 European buyers stand between 3.2m suppliers and 250m customers. Industry watchdogs have described the relationship between buyers and suppliers as feudal: 40 to 50 per cent of fruit and vegetables gets rejected on delivery, and whingeing producers can always be delisted. Supermarkets contend that they have democratised food, keeping prices low. However, while 'known value items' like bread and milk are cheap enough to reel us in, fresh fruit and vegetables cost more than those in independent stores. Then there are the gondola-end promotions - high-fat, high-sugar products famously attractive to children. Supermarkets changed distribution: now even a 'fresh, local' product goes through a centralised point, usually an emission-and congestion-adding road trip of several hundred miles for which it needs to be packaged in plastic. Scarily, Joanna Blythman, author of Shopped: The Shocking Power of British Supermarkets, has warned that we're only in phase one of the story. Expect increased 'walmartisation' as stores expand into the non-food markets, and even made a bid to recast themselves as the focus of communities - several couples have already got married in Asda. It's not that we have to forgo supermarkets completely. Waitrose, 'compassionate supermarket of the year', has created good symbiotic relationships with suppliers, while Sainsburys has made a concerted effort to bring in local, organic produce to coincide with Organic Week, which happens to start today. We can shift some of our spending. An extra \u00a352m could be generated in the economy if we were to support local shops. Then there are box schemes: more than 400 deliver fresh, often organic, fruit and vegetables to 60,000 homes (www.theorganicdirectory.co.uk), while at farmers' markets, producers can come face to face with shoppers and take home 90 per cent of the food pound (www.farmersmarkets.net). There's still time to get your hands dirty and try out one of the UK's 2,000 pick-your-own farms. The trolley backlash starts here. \u00b7 lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
