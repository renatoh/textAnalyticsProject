Woodward's 30-man squad is expected to include at least 10 uncapped players and the income being generated by the Rugby Football Union will ensure that the grass-roots continue to be watered abundantly. Sunday's match between England and the Barbarians attracted a crowd of 62,000 which broke the spending record at Twickenham's shop set by a 75,000 full house against South Africa last November. Sales reached \u00a3237,000, which is \u00a350,000 up on last autumn. While the RFU counts the pounds, its Welsh counterpart is counting the cost after an emergency general meeting of its clubs rejected radical plans to overhaul the administration of the game. The clubs voted to slim down the general committee of the Welsh Rugby Union from 27 to 18 and a steering committee has been set up to appoint a group chief executive who will oversee the day-to-day running of the governing body. Rhodri Morgan, the first minister of the Welsh Assembly, said he could not imagine an executive of high calibre applying, though the post will command a six-figure salary. \"No candidate worth his salt will be interested in the job because the general committee will be breathing down his neck,\" said Morgan. \"The outcome of Sunday's meeting was disappointing but at least some clubs are beginning to realise how serious the WRU's financial position is.\" The WRU chairman Glanmor Griffiths countered: \"Rhodri Morgan should keep out of rugby. The only help he can offer us is to give us some money but even without it our game has a bright future and we are drawing up a 10-year plan which will look at everything from playing and coaching to marketing and administration.\" The WRU will be happy with a crowd of 20,000 for tomorrow's match between Wales and the Barbarians. The Leicester centre Ollie Smith will play for the invitation club four days after helping Leicester win the Heineken Cup at the Millennium Stadium. Reuben Thorne, who has led Canterbury Crusaders to the Super-12 title, was yesterday named captain of the All Blacks. Thorne replaces the injured hooker Anton Oliver. The Lions centre Rob Henderson will miss Ireland's New Zealand tour next month. Henderson, who played for Munster last Saturday, has a shin problem. Barbarians: (v Wales, tomorrow): Montgomery ; Delport (both South Africa), Smith (Leicester), Alatini (New Zealand), Noon (Newcastle); Van Straaten (South Africa), Robinson ; Dowd (both New Zealand), Ibanez (France), Reggiardo (Argentina), Weir (Scotland), Strudwick (London Irish), Lam (Samoa, capt), Kronfeld (New Zealand), Williams (Australia). Replacements: Ledesma (Argentina), Garvey (South Africa), Roche , Chesney, Sorrell (all Saracens), Tonu'u , Botham (Newcastle)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
