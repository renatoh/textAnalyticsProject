But what will be made of British public attitudes towards this war? After one great anti-war demonstration, there has been little outpouring of outrage. As the last miserable dog days drag on in Basra, there is no clamour to end the agony faster. Where are the students on the rampage? Compare this inertia with the fury over Vietnam back in the late 1960s, when Britain had no soldiers in that war. Reasons can be found, excuses made, but this is a depressing sign of current political inertia. The Liberal Democrat leader, Menzies Campbell, wrote to Gordon Brown yesterday: \"The current level of British casualties is unacceptable. What is being achieved by the continuing British presence? Our troops are severely restricted in what they can do and they are subject to unreasonable risks. There is now a clear recognition that the objectives of their mission cannot be achieved ... Is it the case that our continuing presence in Iraq is now only to show solidarity with the United States? Were it so, could it be justified against the level of our casualties? It is time to set a framework for the complete withdrawal of all our forces.\" Yet again, the Lib Dems are right on every point. When I talked to Campbell yesterday, he said he had spoken to top-ranking officers who want out of Iraq while there is still just a chance of saving the situation in Afghanistan. So, he asks Brown, are young men dying only to spare President Bush embarrassment? Soldiers have done everything humanly possible to keep the peace in Basra, but are now driven back into two small and dangerous strongholds from which they can do little: 90% of attacks in the city are now directed against them. Brave men are well-trained to take risks and to see their friends die around them. But Campbell says pleasing the White House is no legitimate war objective. Few disagree, on any side of the house. Brown has already said we will be gone soonish, presumed to be some time next year. He will wait for the report by General Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, due to be given to Congress next month. But in the meantime what does the cabinet say to parents and children of soldiers dying for nothing? That they died making a noble stand to defend the credibility of a disastrous US president on his way out? Will there be a Last Days of Basra medal for that? Campbell is perplexed by Brown's willingness to submit to the timetable of a beleaguered White House. Is it, he asks, part of the price for intelligence-sharing and Trident? He points out that it would positively help the Democrats now if Britain withdrew rapidly. If you have a son the same age as these boys, it does help concentrate the mind. It is also a crisp reminder that most of us live in worlds where no one has a boy anywhere near the armed forces, which have become dangerously detached from most people's ordinary experience - neither the Sandhurst types nor the squaddies drawn mainly from poorer places. When \"we\" go to war it can be as remote as a computer game to most voters and those at the cabinet table. Campbell complains that journalists say \"Iraq fatigue\" makes TV news editors avoid \"another Iraq story\". Even in a thin August, the carnage of the suicide bombings against the Yazidi sect made small impact. The name of each British soldier is reported: the latest was Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath, 22, from Romford - and yet this avoidable death, sanctioned by us, raises less indignation than a gang stabbing. Why so little public revulsion? Various reasons are floated: the defenestration of Blair was cathartic political blood-letting, and the two main parties are equally implicated in the war. George Galloway and Islamist supporters give the impression they rejoice at seeing Britain crushed in the field, which may dampen enthusiasm for the Stop the War coalition. Voters know forces are on the way out anyway: they are bored with the whole thing. In Ipsos Mori's Blair exit poll, his worst ratings were for foreign and defence policy. But voters are fickle and they deceive themselves. Despite a million marching in protest, a majority backed Blair's invasion on the eve of the war. However, by April 2005 only 30% admitted that they had ever supported it. When Blair left two years later, only 11% admitted that they had supported it. The Lib Dems have been right, right and right again about the Iraq war - yet they are suffering in the polls as Labour rides high with a cabinet full of men and women who obediently voted for this calamity (with the honourable exception of John Denham). There have been no apologies. Menzies Campbell says wistfully: \"For the life of me I cannot understand why the cabinet of the time did not stand up to the prime minister when the risks of military involvement were so plain.\" There was huge hidden disquiet on both Labour and Tory backbenches, he says: \"How did the House of Commons let it happen?\" But Iraq has slipped down the public's agenda, and the Lib Dem vote has slipped with it. Why so little anger, about war or climate change? Political activism seems moribund, students voting on cheap beer in their union bars. A gentle camp-out in a field near Heathrow offers signs of life, but looking back on the anti-Vietnam movement, where is the real passion now? Ipsos Mori's Simon Atkinson says: \"We are just not as political as we were. Now we worry about enough fire engines in Cornwall or ... our local district general hospital.\" Ipsos Mori finds most people no longer think politically, detached from parties, tribes and unions that were once the great political educators, as if the end of the cold war bleached out left/right gut political instincts. Instead consumer politics rule: what will politicians deliver for me; whose fault is this? These days politicians never dare challenge individualistic what's-in-it-for-me voters, hugging the middle ground, afraid to speak out boldly on difficult things - gross excess at the top, standing up to America and inequality, standing up for Europe and, most urgently, climate change action. Offered nothing clear to believe in, who can blame people for not bothering to rally to party or cause? At least the war is nearly over - for us, if not Iraqis. But it is unbearable to let one more soldier die for marginal political convenience - and this time the cabinet must say so. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
