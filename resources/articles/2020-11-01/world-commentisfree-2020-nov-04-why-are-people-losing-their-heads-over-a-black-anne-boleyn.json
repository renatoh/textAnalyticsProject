She was married to Henry VIII, a wife-killing tyrant whose legs were covered with pus-filled boils. And, after failing to give her husband a son, she was beheaded on spurious treason charges. Then, to add insult to injury, Boleyn was stuck with a horrible reputation for the next few centuries. And she is still ruffling feathers from beyond the grave. Henry VIII\u2019s second wife is the subject of a new Channel 5 series; she is to be played by the black British actor Jodie Turner-Smith. Predictably, racists are losing their heads over it. (I\u2019d wager many of the same people who think a black woman shouldn\u2019t play a white historical figure have zero issues with Jesus being routinely portrayed as a white guy.) I\u2019m sure Turner-Smith will make a brilliant Boleyn but, to be clear, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly progressive about the casting decision. There is, I think, a widespread misconception that \u201cdiversity\u201d means plugging non-white talent into white stories and spaces. What\u2019s far more important is diversifying the sorts of stories that we tell. Boleyn\u2019s story is fascinating but it\u2019s also very familiar. Meanwhile, there are plenty of non-white queens with beguilingly bloody backstories that few people know about. Take Ranavalona I, the Queen of Madagascar from 1828 to 1861, for example. She cut ties with European powers, staged coups and murdered people with poisonous nuts. I\u2019d watch that show. Or Queen Arwa (no idea why that example came to mind), who ruled Yemen from 1067 until 1138. She reportedly avenged her father-in-law\u2019s murder by luring his killer into a trap and sticking his head on a pole. I\u2019d watch that show, too. So while a black Boleyn is brill, the moral of this story is that we need even more diverse screen queens. \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
