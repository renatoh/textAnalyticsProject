Doctors had thought the disease, which was widespread at the start of the last century, had been wiped out in the 1950s, thanks largely to an improved diet. Now GPs are reporting a resurgence. \"Incidence of the disease could be as high as one in 100 children in ethnic minority groups,\" the department said. The disease, caused by vitamin D deficiency, can impair bone development, leading to deformities, poor tooth formation and stunted growth. Left untreated, it can cause bow legs or knock knees. Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, will today issue guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women to boost their intake of vitamin D. She is to make free supplies available to NHS doctors and health visitors participating in the Healthy Start scheme in poorer areas. During the summer months, people generate vitamin D from sunlight. About 15 minutes' exposure of the arms, head and shoulders is sufficient to make enough of the vitamin to maintain good health. The department said: \"Foods like oily fish, eggs, fortified cereals and breads are all sources of vitamin D, but these may still be inadequate when sunshine hours are limited. At these times pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under four may benefit from a supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D.\" It added: \"Dark-skinned people do not absorb as much sunlight through the skin and may also wear clothing that limits exposure to the sun for cultural reasons.\" During winter in latitudes north of Birmingham, there was no ultraviolet light of the appropriate wavelength for the body to make vitamin D. Primarolo said: \"We encourage people who are eligible to take advantage of the free vitamins, to minimise the risk of developing vitamin D deficiency and other conditions. We particularly encourage women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to take vitamin D, to protect the health and wellbeing of their baby and help them get the best possible start in life. \"If you think you may be at risk of vitamin D deficiency, check with your general practitioner, who may use a blood test to diagnose this deficiency.\" The department said healthcare staff were concerned at the increasing numbers of children at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Dr Colin Michie, a paediatrician at Ealing hospital, west London, said the biggest problem was caused by low vitamin D intake among expectant mothers. He said: \"We are seeing significant numbers of children with vitamin D deficiency. Mothers and babies are simply not getting enough of this important vitamin. \"Most pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a vitamin D supplement to ensure babies get the best start in life. Babies receive vitamin D from their mothers while in the womb, and then from breast milk until they are weaned. \"If a pregnant or breastfeeding woman is lacking in vitamin D, the baby will also have low vitamin D and calcium levels, which can lead babies to develop seizures in the first months of life.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
