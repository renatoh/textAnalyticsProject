So these 12 young dancers, just out of training, put everything they\u2019ve got into every minute on stage, like a 12-month audition for the rest of their dancing lives. The new works created for them are uneven but their commitment is total, the energy fearless and forthright \u2013 that\u2019s pretty exciting to watch. Jermaine Spivey is himself best known as an incredible dancer, with Crystal Pite\u2019s company Kidd Pivot, but he\u2019s still feeling his way in choreography. His piece Terms and Conditions is most revelatory in the introduction of American dancer Prince Lyons, who drags your eyes to him and no one else, with wildness, funk and elegant finesse all in one. There\u2019s more of Lyons in the duet Sin, extracted from Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Damien Jalet\u2019s award-winning Babel(words) from 2010. It\u2019s a ravenous, murderous power play between Lyons and Dutch dancer Minouche Van de Ven, and they bring strength and slick speed to its acrobatic manoeuvres, Van de Ven swinging, wrapped and twisted round Lyons\u2019s body, with the sharp snap of a flip book. Watch out for these two. Last year\u2019s Rambert2 highlight was Sharon Eyal\u2019s Killer Pig, and a new work, Sama, from American choreographer Andrea Miller might have been commissioned to provide some of the same raw, aggressively clubby energy. It begins feeling a bit spiritual \u2013 like, gap year in Asia spiritual \u2013 and ends up full-on full-moon party. Miller\u2019s mission is to address what she calls the \u201capocalypse of the body\u201d, the numbing of physical experience in subordination to digital life. It\u2019s not as subversive or intimidatingly cool as Eyal\u2019s work, but with the help of haze, heavy bass, flashing lights and relentless rhythm, Miller plugs into some primal pulse, awakening (and ultimately pummelling) the senses, the dancers living intensely in their bodies. And yet, at the same time they move with the self-possession of those knowing they\u2019re being looked at, and knowing how good they look. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be 20 \u2013 and this talented. \u2022 On UK tour until 10 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
