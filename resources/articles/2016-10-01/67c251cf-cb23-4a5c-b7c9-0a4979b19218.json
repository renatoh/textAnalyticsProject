The manager reported that Giroud\u2019s toe injury, which he sustained at Paris Saint\u2011Germain on 13 September and aggravated against Chelsea 11 days later, would keep the player out for a further two weeks, and it is plain that it is a frustrating time for the 30-year-old. Giroud has sometimes been the target for Arsenal fans\u2019 anger and there has long been debate over whether he is good enough to lead them to the Premier League title. But Wenger said that he had missed the striker in the club\u2019s previous game \u2013 the 1-0 win at Burnley \u2013 and he believes that Giroud remains a player to be counted on. \u201cI am an admirer of Giroud because he has gone through some tough times and he bounces back,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWhen his back is to the wall, he has an answer every time. When I go into a big game, you always think: \u2018I can rely on him.\u2019 You know that when the competition starts, he will be with you.\u201d Giroud was also a target for some France fans at Euro 2016 but the manager, Didier Deschamps, selected him regularly as the team reached the final, where they lost to Portugal. \u201cBefore the competition, the supporters didn\u2019t want him,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cBut he turned them around. That\u2019s one of the strengths of Olivier. He is mentally very strong. \u201cThe criticism does knock him. He\u2019s not made of metal. He\u2019s sensitive but sensitive and strong. Everybody wants to be loved. I\u2019ve never seen anyone who dreams to be hated. But it is dealing with the fact that it doesn\u2019t always go your way that makes a man.\u201d Wenger gave Giroud an extended summer break after his exertions at Euro 2016 and he was easing him back to fitness at the time of the season\u2019s first international break in early September. Giroud had made just one substitute\u2019s appearance at Leicester City but he started in France\u2019s games against Italy and Belarus \u2013 the latter of which was a World Cup qualifier. When Giroud returned to Arsenal, Wenger kept him as a substitute, bringing him on against Southampton and PSG. It was in the latter fixture \u2013 in which Giroud was also sent off \u2013 that the toe problem started. Wenger was asked whether Giroud\u2019s involvement for France had caused a problem, as he had not looked ready to start when he was called up. \u201cYes,\u201d Wenger replied, before he added: \u201cI was not surprised he played. He was on the way up and France just came at the right time to have a game. I thought the two games with France would help him to get his fitness back but, after that, he got his injury.\u201d Wenger has used Alexis S\u00e1nchez up front this season and Giroud faces a fight to regain his place when fit. \u201cS\u00e1nchez can also play on the flank, like he has before,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe\u2019s happy to play on the flank and up front. I will have to try to find the best solution game by game.\u201d Wenger said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
