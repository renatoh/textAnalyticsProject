It has to send out a message to the lunatics who masquerade as football fans that their behaviour will not be tolerated and that England's next match, against Slovakia at the Riverside Stadium on June 11, must be played behind closed doors. The FA should be hit by a heavy fine and warned that further transgressions by the boneheads who claim to be football supporters could lead to a complete ban from international football. At risk of sounding like some reactionary old Colonel Blimp figure, tough words have to be spoken and severe punishments handed out. If that is the only language that can be understood by the scum who continue to defile our national sport, so be it. The problem of football hooliganism and thuggery is still there and, in my opinion, anybody who argues otherwise is a fool. Mercifully, Premiership grounds are probably safer than ever. High attendances, with most fans either holding season tickets or being part of membership schemes, have proved beneficial. Troublemakers can be isolated, ejected and banned, and stewards have a fair idea where any flash points may occur within grounds and are able to react accordingly. Sadly, internationals are another story. The FA will argue that England matches in this country are not a problem, that Sunderland was an isolated incident not indicative of a growing trend of violence, and that the FA is as capable as any national footballing governing body of ensuring matches go ahead without the taunts Turkey's players and supporters were forced to endure. It will point to its support of the \"Kick it Out\" campaign aimed at eradicating all forms of racism within the sport and the close links it has developed with various fans' groups and forums. And it will say that they pushed the government to introduce legislation after Euro 2000 to tighten the regulations under which fans may be banned from attending England matches and forbidden from travelling abroad with the team. But as hundreds, perhaps thousands, stood and chanted \"I'd rather be a Paki than a Turk\", and then engaged in pitched battles in the town after the match, any sane person would have to say that this cancer has not been cut out. It is still there, feeding off the beautiful game, dangerous and malignant. And it is no good, as the FA has hinted behind the scenes, to suggest there is nothing worse here than what goes on in Italy, the Netherlands or eastern Europe. Also, it is preposterous to even hint that this has become some sort of classic media feeding frenzy where the facts are painted as darkly as possible to perpetuate the story. Recently I took close friend's seven-year-old to the City Ground in Nottingham to watch his first game of football. He loved the goals and the drama, the half-time burger, and talked excitedly afterwards about a new experience. Football had a new fan. But I shudder to think what his reaction might have been if I had been stupid enough to take him to watch the national team. The wounds would have taken a long time to heal and the scars might have lasted forever. You tend to grow up quickly in a football ground. At Bramall Lane in the 1960s, I remember Millwall fans getting on to the Shoreham Street end. I can still remember the screams of fear as the knife blades flashed. Years later, I remember watching the horrors of Heysel and speaking to the great BBC commentator Peter Jones afterwards. He had wept for the game he loved and despaired for the future. And another good friend, a Liverpool supporter, still finds it difficult to hold back the tears when he hears \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" and remembers the best mate he lost on the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough. These are the images those who truly love football should never forget. And it is why I would support any move that might prevent any recurrence. David Beckham evidently agrees. In a recent magazine interview he said: \"I can't imagine a game where there's no crowd. It would be like a pre-season friendly, a practice match. It's a shame for the fans and the young kids who are coming to watch players they admire. But if it's going to put an end to the trouble then we should consider it. \"It's disappointing when you see the trouble that goes on around football matches. There was a period when most of it stopped but it seems to be creeping back into the game. Of course players notice it and worry about it.\" As a country we quite rightly protested when Emile Heskey, Ashley Cole and others were on the receiving end of racism. Slovakia have already paid the price this season for their fans' behaviour and were forced to play their game against Liechtenstein behind closed doors on the same night as the England-Turkey match. And let's not forget Uefa has already handed England a fine, a \u00a39,000 slap on the wrist, for supporters' misdemeanours in Bratislava. The FA is apparently trying to do a deal behind the scenes whereby England get the chance to play Slovakia, as planned, at the Riverside Stadium and England forgo tickets for the potentially explosive return fixture against Turkey in October.It does itself few favours to have come up with such a proposal. It should not take the threat of a closed ground to make the FA see sense so far as that is concerned. England's travelling supporters are too often a national disgrace. Decent fans may be slighted, and will argue that they should not be punished for the actions of a minority. But they have to concede we are talking about a substantial majority. It is no good saying, as an FA insider did this week, that this is society's problem and not football's. That is utter rubbish and I hope very much that the FA does not come out with that when it sits down with Uefa. Of course it is an imperfect society, but that does not mean we throw our hands up and say there is nothing we can do about it. Uefa should tell the FA it is delighted that it is supporting so many initiatives to stamp out racism and hooliganism, but it should also point out that it is an FA responsibility to keep fans off the pitch and ensure they behave in a proper manner within the ground. And it is an FA responsibility to stop racist chants and abuse. CCTV cameras make it possible to identify and punish the guilty ones, and the FA must ensure its stewards maintain order. It is not good enough to be telling Uefa, \"We are trying our best and, by the way, it's just as bad everywhere else.\" The Premier League has gone a long way towards eradicating the problem at our biggest clubs and now the FA has to follow suit. Perhaps the message hasn't got through yet, and that is why Thursday's punishment has to be tough, for the good of the sport I love."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
