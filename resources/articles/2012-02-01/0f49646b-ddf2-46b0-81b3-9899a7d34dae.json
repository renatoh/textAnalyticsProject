The sport's most influential international governing body \u2013 which earlier withheld $100,000 of Chisora's purse \u2013 said on Tuesday night that at a hearing at a date to be announced it will impose a heavy fine on the London boxer and remove his name from their rankings. The ban prevents Chisora fighting for a WBC title but is not binding on the three other main governing bodies. The fighter also has to appear before the British Board of Control on 14 March. The WBC will not consider recognising Chisora again until he has undergone an anger management course, action Haye called for in a television interview from Las Vegas on Monday night. In a clumsily worded statement the WBC president, Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n, told BoxingScene.com that Chisora's fight with Haye \u2013 in which Haye claimed he had threatened to \"shoot\" him after being struck in the face \u2013 was \"one of the worst behaviours ever by a professional boxer\". There was no censure for Haye, who says he was acting in self-defence and has been supported in that view by the German boxing authorities. The weight of opinion against Chisora stems from his leaving the podium at the post-fight press conference to confront Haye, who had gained entry through his media work with British and German television.Haye, who flew to Las Vegas, is wanted for questioning by Munich police, who have interviewed and released Chisora. Charges for assault are pending against both boxers. Sulaim\u00e1n said the WBC also took into account Chisora's slapping Klitschko at the weigh-in and spitting water in the face of his brother, Wladimir, in the ring immediately before the fight. \"Boxers are gentlemen,\" Sulaim\u00e1n said, \"and show to the world an example of honour and fair play when, after a tremendous battle, they go to the centre of the ring to pay respect to each other. Dereck Chisora is not going to tarnish the sport for those born in the humblest beds, who become sports heroes of the world to live a life of dignity and pride. Chisora, however, as a human being that he is, is going to be strongly invited to enter an anger management rehabilitating program that hopefully will act in his benefit.\" The WBC's response will carry weight with the BBBoC, who have strong links with the council, but whom Frank Warren criticised for not intervening in a dispute between Chisora and Wladimir Klitschko in the fighter's dressing room before the fight. Klitschko was there to intimidate Chisora, Warren claimed, and his unreasonable insistence on the fighter re-wrapping his hands not only led to the fight starting 20 minutes late but contributed to Chisora's agitated state. Warren, Chisora's promoter, criticised the WBC for failing to go through a proper disciplinary process. \"What I find strange about this is that there hasn't been a hearing,\" he told Sky Sports News. \"Somebody arbitrarily saying 'you're banned' can't be any form of natural justice. \"Even the police in Germany let Dereck Chisora go after questioning. \"A lot of things happened behind the scenes. There were some things which he did which absolutely were wrong and he shouldn't have done, and I'm not condoning that. \"But at the end of the day you are entitled to a hearing before anybody makes a decision.\" Chisora, widely praised for a brave defeat on points to Klitschko, has two previous convictions for assault, on a police officer and his then girlfriend, as well as for possessing an offensive weapon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
