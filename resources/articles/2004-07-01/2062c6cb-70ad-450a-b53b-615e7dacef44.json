As principal speaker for the Green party from 1997 to 2001, and again from last September, he was everything a green politician should be, combining an inspiring vision of how the world could be with policies to get there. He was also leader of the Green group on Oxford city council, contributing to the growth of green politics locally as well as nationally. He brought a professionalism to the party and, as speaker, was articulate, passionate and persuasive. Born in Hartley, Kent, Woodin was educated at Gravesend grammar school. He graduated in psychology from Manchester University, and took his doctorate at Wolfson College, Oxford, where he also captained the college rowing team. He went on to lecture in psychology at Balliol College - and continued his love of singing by joining the Oxford Bach choir. Elected as Oxford's first Green councillor in 1994, he worked tirelessly to make the local party one of the most successful in the country. He was instrumental in its rise to seven councillors, giving it the balance of power on the council. Two weeks ago, he became the Greens' representative on the council's new executive board, ensuring his party a voice at the heart of the city's government. One of Woodin's legacies will be a greater understanding of how Green politicians can stay true to their vision while operating in the everyday world of grey politics. As he put it: \"The ideal is rarely, if ever, an option and, as we are discovering in Oxford, where we have left the luxury of opposition behind, the art of being successful greens in power lies in knowing when to settle for what can be achieved rather than holding out for more and failing to get anything.\" It was an art of which he was a master. Nationally and internationally, as a member of the Green party's ruling executive, Woodin made a critical contribution to the strategy that saw the election of the first British Greens to the European parliament in 1999. He was a brilliant communicator, and hugely enjoyed the battle of wits involved in pub lic debates and the media. For him, they were vehicles for the urgent task of spreading the message of green politics. His was a vision of how the world could be - a world, as he put it, \"where people can live at peace with themselves, at peace with each other and at peace with the natural world\". His commitment to peace, social justice and environ-mental sustainability touched the hearts and changed the minds of many. Woodin was deeply critical of neo-liberal economics and the unquestioning pursuit of profit and materialism, and his psychological training led him to analyse the impact of globalisation not only in economic terms but also in terms of its impact on people's lives and hopes. He spoke passionately about how the overriding drive for competitiveness feeds through to the individual level, \"where it generates endless social comparison and, in turn, resentment. In the classroom, community or workplace, there is always someone brighter, wealthier or more attractive to envy and to blind us to a sense of our own self-worth.\" Woodin spent much of the last 18 months working on Green Alternatives To Globalisation: A Manifesto, which we co-wrote, and was published earlier this year. He signed off the proofs the day before his cancer diagnosis in February. At the Green party's spring conference a month later, he spoke with courage of the enormous hole that cancer had punched in his life, and of his efforts to come to terms with it. His death has punched a hole in the lives of his family and his many friends. He leaves his wife Deborah, herself a former Green councillor, whom he married in 1994, and two children, aged five and two. \u00b7 Michael Edward Woodin, psychologist and politician, born November 6 1965; died July 9 2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
