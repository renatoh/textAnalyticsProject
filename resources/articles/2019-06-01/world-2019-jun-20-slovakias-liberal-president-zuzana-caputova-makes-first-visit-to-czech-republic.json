Havel led the protests that resulted in the fall of the communist regime in the 1989 Velvet Revolution. The wreath-laying event came after she was greeted at Prague Castle by Milo\u0161 Zeman, the populist Czech president whose controversially outspoken views are seen as the polar opposite of what his new Slovak counterpart represents. The two leaders exchanged friendly words but appeared ill at ease as a brass band played during a welcome ceremony attended by senior Czech politicians and other dignitaries. There were fears beforehand that the meeting might be marred by Zeman\u2019s penchant for politically insensitive and sometimes sexist remarks. The visit followed a convention established after the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia into the separate states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia that the presidents of each country should call on the other as their first trip abroad. But the visit of \u010caputov\u00e1, five days after her inauguration last Saturday, carried added piquancy because her political outlook is so at odds with Zeman\u2019s. It also came as liberal activists were preparing to stage what they promise will be the biggest protest rally yet this Sunday against Andrej Babi\u0161, the Czech prime minister and Zeman\u2019s political ally who has faced a series of demonstrations demanding his resignation over perceived corruption and conflicts of interest. \u010caputov\u00e1 was not scheduled to meet Babi\u0161, who was in Brussels for a European council meeting. By visiting the grave of Havel, however, she appeared to be drawing explicit attention to the contrast between current Czech politics and her election in March, which followed a wave of popular protests in Slovakia over the murder last year of J\u00e1n Kuciak, a journalist who was investigating corruption, and his fiancee. \u010caputov\u00e1 was greeted by a small number of Czech well-wishers at Havel\u2019s grave, some waving Slovak flags, with whom she briefly chatted afterwards and posed for selfies. The group all repeated \u201cyes\u201d in unison when asked if they wished \u010caputov\u00e1 was president of the Czech Republic. Analysts and political activists say \u010caputov\u00e1 \u2013 a lawyer who came to public attention by successfully leading the fight against an illegal landfill site in Slovakia \u2013 is seen as a ray of hope by many Czechs, who despair at the state of local politics but bemoan a lack of alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspiration for us to see that in Slovakia civil society can work to create not just a new party but to win a presidential election,\u201d said Benjamin Roll, deputy leader of the Million Moments for Democracy movement that has organised the anti-Babi\u0161 rallies. \u201cThere was a lot of sadness last year that Milo\u0161 Zeman was re-elected despite all he had done. Now these people look at Slovakia and see some hope that we can find someone like \u010caputov\u00e1 in the next presidential election.\u201d Ji\u0159\u00ed Pehe, director of New York University in Prague and a Czech political analyst, said many Czech people were \u201cprojecting their political aspirations\u201d on to \u010caputov\u00e1. \u201cI see a lot of people on social media who would not be typical fans of V\u00e1clav Havel but who are unhappy with the current president and say openly that they would be happy if someone like her became president here,\u201d he said. In an interview with the Guardian this year, \u010caputov\u00e1 identified Havel \u2013 who died in 2011 and became the first president of the Czech Republic after Czechoslovakia\u2019s breakup \u2013 as one of her political heroes. \u201cI consider V\u00e1clav Havel to be one of the most inspiring political leaders, specifically in that authenticity that he exuded,\u201d she said. Michael \u017dantovsk\u00fd, director of the V\u00e1clav Havel library and author of a biography of the late leader, said \u010caputov\u00e1 was an apt successor. \u201cHer visit is symbolic because Havel had always expressed hope that his successor might be a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe she is a worthy representative of his values.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
