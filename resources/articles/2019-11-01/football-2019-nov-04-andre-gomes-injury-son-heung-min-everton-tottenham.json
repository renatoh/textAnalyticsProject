Gomes sustained a fracture dislocation at Goodison Park after being fouled by Son Heung-min, although it was a combination of an awkward landing and collision with Serge Aurier in the aftermath that caused the fracture. Players from both teams were visibly distraught as Gomes received treatment on the pitch before being taken to Aintree Hospital, with Everton confirming on Monday that the former Barcelona and Valencia midfielder has now had surgery. \u201cThe Portugal international will now spend some time recovering in hospital, before returning to USM Finch Farm to start his rehabilitation under the guidance of the club\u2019s medical staff,\u201d read a statement. \u201cThe 26-year-old is expected to make a full recovery. On behalf of Andr\u00e9, the Club would like to thank all Everton supporters and members of the wider football family for the overwhelming messages of support we have received since yesterday\u2019s match.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s Ben Davies has admitted the injury deeply affected everyone on the field on Sunday but insisted Son, who was shown a red card by referee Martin Atkinson, did not intentionally hurt Gomes. \u201cIt does affect you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time it has happened to me in a game, it happened when S\u00e9amus Coleman suffered a bad injury for Ireland [against Wales] as well. It shakes you up, it really does. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your teammate or not. You can see the emotion across the pitch. \u201cNobody goes on the pitch to hurt anyone, especially not somebody like Son who is a bit broken dealing with what has happened. The team just have to sometimes say these things happen in football and, as horrible as it is, they do. For us it is just hoping Andr\u00e9 Gomes is OK now.\u201d Son was initially booked by Atkinson but then sent off for what the Premier League later clarified as: \u201cendangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge.\u201d The Spurs manager, Mauricio Pochettino, did not rule out the possibility of an appeal against the dismissal after the game. \u201cSon is really shaken up,\u201d added Davies. \u201cHe\u2019s down about what happened. I speak for everyone when I say sympathy for Gomes, I hope he\u2019s alright. We will try to pick him [Son] up as much as we can. It\u2019s tough right now. It\u2019s just about making sure that he realises he didn\u2019t go out there to hurt anyone, he thinks that people may see that in him but it\u2019s not the case. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things. There were probably three more tackles that were worse than the incident that happened. It\u2019s a freak moment in football. Son can\u2019t let himself be too down about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
