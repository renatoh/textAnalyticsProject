Researchers at Rockefeller University in New York found that the immune system not only remembered the virus but improved the quality of protective antibodies after an infection had passed, equipping the body to unleash a swift and potent attack if the virus invaded a second time. \u201cIt\u2019s very good news,\u201d said Michel Nussenzweig, the head of molecular immunology at Rockerfeller and a senior author of the study. \u201cThe expectation is that people should be able to produce a rapid antibody response and resist infection in a large number of cases.\u201d It is unclear how long the immune system\u2019s memory might last, but Nussenzweig said it could potentially provide some protection for years. The discovery may explain why verified re-infections from the virus are so far quite rare. When people are infected with coronavirus, the immune system launches a multi-pronged attack. One form of protection comes from T cells, which seek and destroy infected cells, and so prevent the virus from spreading. A second front involves B cells, which release antibodies into the blood. Antibodies latch on to the virus and stop it from invading cells in the first place. Once the infection has passed, the immune system stands down, but it remembers the virus by storing so-called memory T cells and memory B cells. Should the virus return, these are immediately called to action. Many studies have shown that the first wave of antibodies to coronavirus wane after a few months, raising concerns that people may lose immunity quickly. In their study of 87 coronavirus patients, the US researchers confirmed that antibodies wane, falling to about a fifth of their peak level over six months, but this may not matter too much, they believe. When the researchers examined the immune system\u2019s memory, they noticed that six months after infection the antibodies made by memory B cells had evolved to become more potent. These highly honed antibodies could be unleashed within days of re-infection, rather than taking a couple of weeks to build up, as seen in primary infections. The scientists went on to show that tiny amounts of coronavirus, or protein fragments from inactive virus particles, lurked in patients\u2019 intestines and apparently helped to maintain the immune system\u2019s memory. The remnants of the virus are not thought to be harmful. \u201cThe take-home lessons are that people who have been infected, six months later have persistent B cell memory responses with antibodies that can neutralise the virus and can do it very well,\u201d Nussenzweig said. That could mean wiping out the virus before it takes hold, he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long any protection will last, but it might be a really long time. It could be years.\u201d The study is preliminary and has not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Charles Bangham, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the work suggested there was \u201ca very good chance that if you\u2019re re-exposed, you\u2019ll make a brisker immune response\u201d to the virus. \u201cIt remains to be proved that it\u2019s protective, but you would be reasonably confident it would have some beneficial effect,\u201d he said. Arne Akbar, a professor of immunology at University College London, said: \u201cThis is good news for everybody who has been sick with coronavirus.\u201d He said the immune system was like an army that stands down once the threat is over, but remains prepared for a future invasion. \u201cYou want the army to be generated again very quickly, and this is what these researchers have found.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
