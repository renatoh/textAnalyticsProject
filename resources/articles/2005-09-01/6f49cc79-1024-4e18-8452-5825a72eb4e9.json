Just when it looked as if more ammunition was being stored for the Premiership-is-boring brigade, Liverpool ended their goal drought and Birmingham ended their lean start to the season home in rousing fashion. Throw in a sending-off for 19-year-old Neil Kilkenny on his league debut and a rant at the officials by Steve Bruce and you get some idea of how the temperature rose splendidly. 'No one could have predicted at half-time it would turn out like that,' said Bruce. 'It became a smashing game, if a bit crazy. After three home defeats we showed some character. It was just a pity we couldn't hold on at 2-1.' The plus for Rafael Benitez is the way substitute Luis Garcia sparked his team's return to scoring ways ahead of Wednesday's Champions League game against Chelsea. 'We can approach [the Chelsea game] with confidence because we are scoring again,' said the Liverpool manager. 'But we still lost two points. We controlled the game for a long time and had enough chances to have won it. So there is still a need for improvement in some areas.' A bleak opening period produced only two moments to remember. Emile Heskey had the chance to put one over his old team after muscling his way past Jamie Carragher, only to place his shot too near Jose Reina, who saved with his legs. Soon after, Peter Crouch set up Steven Gerrard for a shot driven sweetly from 22 yards, the ball striking the inside of Maik Taylor's right-hand post and rebounding out of reach of the incoming Florent Sinama-Pongolle. Had Mikael Forssell matched his awareness with better control after darting between Carragher and Sami Hyypia, Birmingham would have struck the first blow soon after the interval. But he allowed the ball to squirm away from him and it was Liverpool who went ahead when Gerrard, becoming increasingly influential, played Garcia through for a low finish into the corner. Julian Gray's inswinging cross led to the equaliser, Stephen Warnock glancing the ball into his own net at the near post amid a breakdown in communication with his goalkeeper. Reina then failed to hold Heskey's header after Jermaine Pennant crossed and Walter Pandiani, tucked away the rebound. Jamie Clapham cleared off the line from Garcia. Then came controversy. Gerrard looked to have fouled Gray, but the decision went the other way, Carragher's header off the crossbar was handled on the line by Kilkenny and Cisse converted the penalty. Bruce berated fourth official Peter Walton,saying: 'The decision was a joke. He seemed more concerned during the game with me staying inside the technical area.' What was less in doubt was the way Liverpool went for the winner and really should have got it. Crouch headed over from Cisse's cross, who then drove wide from a good position and Clapham made another vital clearance when Crouch got his next header on target. But it would have been harsh on a side without a clutch of midfield players out through injury and suspension to offer a hint of better things to come. Man of the match: Luis Garcia - made things happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
