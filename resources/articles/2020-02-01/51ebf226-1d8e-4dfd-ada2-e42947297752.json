But speaking after a meeting with the French president in the Elys\u00e9e palace on Friday, Bibi said she had not decided where she would settle. She was acquitted last year and granted a one-year leave of stay with her family in Canada. \u201cI need time to think,\u201d Bibi said. \u201cCanada has been good to me. France has been very good to me \u2013 and France has given me a name. But for the time being I need to concentrate on my health, my family and my children\u2019s education.\u201d Bibi\u2019s case outraged Christians around the world and fanned divisions inside mainly Muslim Pakistan. The former farm worker was sentenced to death in 2010 after Muslim labourers working with her in the fields refused to share their water because she was Christian. An argument broke out and one woman went to a local cleric to accuse Bibi of committing blasphemy against the prophet Muhammad. Two Pakistani politicians were later killed for publicly supporting her and criticising the country\u2019s draconian blasphemy laws. Pakistan\u2019s supreme court overturned the conviction in October 2018, sparking violent protests in the country and calls for the judges in the case to be killed. The violence was led by the Islamic group Tehreek-e-Labbaik. Bibi was also in France to promote her book Enfin Libre! (Finally Free!), co-written with Anne-Isabelle Tollet, a French journalist who helped publicise her case with two previous books and forming an international support committee in 2015. \u201cI was very honoured to be received by the president, to be next to him, and to be invited to live here,\u201d Bibi said, sitting alongside her daughter Eisha, 21, who is disabled. She was also accompanied on the trip by her husband Ashiq, 58, and her second daughter Eisham, 20. \u201cFrance is a symbol for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the first country in the world to really support me, and the country from which my name became known.\u201d Bibi said she was also deeply honoured earlier this week to meet the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who presented her with honorary citizenship of the city. An Elys\u00e9e official said France was \u201cready to welcome\u201d Bibi if she wished, providing she met the criteria for asylum. French rules require asylum seekers to submit a request to an independent state agency, Ofpra, which decides whether it should be to granted. It is understood that Bibi filled in the appropriate forms with her family members on Friday. Although she said she had not received any recent death threats, Islamic extremists have pledged to pursue and kill her. In Canada, she lives with her husband and daughters in a three-bedroom apartment in an undisclosed location. She told French media this week she was hopeful things would change to allow her and her family to return to Pakistan one day. \u201cI really hope for it, just the way I kept hope when I was in jail that one day I was going to be free,\u201d she said. Bibi said she was grateful for the prayers of fellow Christians around the world who had helped her remain strong before her release. In her book, Bibi recounts how she was kept chained in prison and jeered at by other detainees. A devout Catholic, she said she had never committed blasphemy: \u201cI cannot even think of insulting any prophet. I didn\u2019t say anything. It was all about a glass of water.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
