Polly Toynbee (The dam's burst. Now voters just want to wallop Labour, May 20) identifies the 10p tax issue almost as a tipping point. No doubt Gordon Brown feels this is unfair, given his help for low-paid people, but New Labour seems to have taken for granted that its \"natural\" supporters will stick by it despite its wide range of Thatcherite policies. While the Conservatives might offer alternatives that appear attractive, they would be different in government - people who were ministers or advisers under Thatcher and Major are unlikely to really have changed that much. This seems like an opportunity for the Lib-Dems, but they have a poor record of taking advantage of such chances. I suspect that many Labour supporters who are tired of New Labour will either not bother voting in a general election or be attracted by David Cameron as Blair-lite. As a long-term Labour voter, I find all this really depressing. Roy Kettle Hitchin, Hertfordshire Surely, I think, New Labour cannot dig their grave any deeper? I then read that schools are going to be encouraged to set up army cadet corps and an \"armed forces day\" is to be established, perhaps as a public holiday (Discrimination against military to be outlawed, May 20). Even the awful Thatcher/Major regime would have seen this as in bad taste, worthy only of a crumbling third-world government with authoritarian leanings. Bill Major Liverpool The ideological and probable electoral disintegration of New Labour reminds me of the portrayal of Hitler in his bunker during the dying moments of the Nazi regime in the film Downfall. Unable to admit to themselves that the New Labour experiment is over, its ministers resort to even more desperate and delusional policies such as the expansion of cadet forces in schools while trying to set in stone the policies that got them into this position, for example the selling off of the NHS to the private sector (polyclinics). Dr Raoul Bianchi London New Labour's capitulation on inheritance tax, its aversion to nationalising Northern Rock and the symbolism of the abolition of the 10p tax rate as a means of cutting tax for the better-off were simply the final straws. The rot set in with the Iraq war, but it has always been present in the logic of triangulation. Toynbee's plaintive cries of \"Why aren't the voters more grateful?\" and blaming of external forces do not constitute a counterargument to the growing suspicion that New Labour has destroyed everything that made the Labour party worth voting for. D Cameron Stoke-on-Trent George Monbiot stirs the pot of gloom and cynicism, a traditional recipe of the right to undermine confidence in collective state action and promote individualism. Like much of the media he is obsessed with picking holes where he can and has no interest in the positive impact of social policy or public investment, where the government has a progressive record. Meanwhile Clegg and Cameron are making ominous noises about cutting taxes, for which read cutting public services. Time to take a closer look, George. Nye Harries Bristol A consensus on climate change (The war to end all wars, May 20) cannot emerge as long as we have to deny what other parties have done. While the dash for gas was market-driven, it accounted for the best part of Labour's claim to be able to meet our Kyoto commitments. But it happened under a Conservative watch, so we cannot acknowledge it nor learn from it. Now, in the Crewe byelection, the Tories are trying make hay out of our commitment to tax gas guzzlers. Pure cynicism. In a competitive democracy, the narcissism of small differences takes home the prize. Only extra-parliamentary activity is likely to restore some backbone in a democracy which has fallen prey to mere displacement activity.
