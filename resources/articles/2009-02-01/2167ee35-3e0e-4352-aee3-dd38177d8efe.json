They said they don't read contracts they sign, don't check the speeches they write, and the law - well, what's the use of that? Fredrik Neij was questioned by lawyers for the music business, which is bringing a civil case in parallel with the criminal one being brought by the Swedish state prosecutor. Peter Danowsky, representing the music business, noted that Neij owns the Pirate Bay domain; there's a contract with his name where he says he'll oversee its operations. \"But I didn't read it,\" said Neij. (In a British court this would be a \"dog ate my homework\" excuse. And works just as badly.) How about his 2006 speech (in Swedish) where he said the site had received threats from copyright owners? \"I just read what someone had written,\" Neij, who says he is dyslexic, replied. He added that he thinks the site is legal. A telling slice of the examination: Prosecutor: But who decided what would be done? Neij: Everyone! Whoever thought that something needed to be done, did it. P: So no one had any overall control? N: No, why should it be needed? Then Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, dubbed the \"datan\u00f6rd\" (yup, data nerd) took the stand. A prosecution line of questioning trying to get him to say who ran the site and who profited didn't garner much; he insisted it was not a top-down business, but instead a \"project\" where volunteers would come and go. So: not a great deal of excitement to report. But that's how trials often go: drama at the start, and then it settles down into a long, slow crescendo as the prosecution builds its case - followed by the diminuendo and then crescendo as the defence builds its case. And then a quick bit of parry and thrust, and then judgement. Set your watches for April..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
