But the Spain striker is now more at ease in body and mind and reaping the benefits. Two goals against Crystal Palace on Sunday swelled Morata\u2019s recent tally to five in six matches, a burst more reminiscent of his prolific start at Stamford Bridge following a \u00a358m transfer from Real Madrid in the summer of 2017. His previous 31 matches had yielded four goals after a back injury, which flared in January and initially baffled the medical staff, blunted his impact. The forward is now restored to fitness but a player whom Maurizio Sarri acknowledged as \u201cfragile\u201d after the weekend\u2019s 3-1 win admits his real battle has been to recover mentally from last season\u2019s toils. \u201cThe most important thing is that, finally, I have found the right way and my head is OK,\u201d Morata said. \u201cIn football physical condition is veryimportant but the head is the most important thing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the head, if the mentality is not good, then you are in trouble. I\u2019m better. \u201cNo one, only my wife, knows how big the last year was. Now it\u2019s OK. In the last month of last season I was down, down, down, down. I cannot be more down. When you touch the limit, the only thing you can do is to come back. \u201cIt takes long because I had an injury, I was not fit when playing, but now I feel good. I had a period where everything \u2026 if it was raining, I was angry because it\u2019s raining; if I miss, it\u2019s because the pitch is too wet. It was only excuses. It is not good. \u201cHonestly, last year I was always joking in the dressing room at the beginning because I started well and was scoring goals. But the injury, it killed me, because the doctors didn\u2019t know what I had. It was strange. Sometimes when you know you are out for one month, it\u2019s OK in your head, because you know it is one month. But when you are trying to give your best and you are not in your best moment, it\u2019s difficult. Now, that\u2019s the past. \u201cEveryone can have a bad period in their life. But we are famous, we have a lot of things. Sometimes people think we are not human, with no feelings, with no problems. The important thing is to find the right balance. \u201cNow, I have, and I am very happy. The important thing is the team. I know that sometimes I am in the middle of all the criticism when the team drops [points] or when the team loses. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I want to win with this team and we have a very good chance.\u201d Morata, whose wife gave birth to twins in July, might have completed a hat-trick against Palace only to opt to chip Wayne Hennessey, at 6ft 6in, from close range after sprinting through on goal in stoppage time. \u201cI suffered a lot in the past and needed to score three for myself, for my team and for the supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important for me. Honestly, I think I missed because I had only this in my head. \u201cIf I don\u2019t think, probably I score. In the last 10 minutes I only have in my head \u2018I want to bring the ball home\u2019 and that\u2019s why I missed. The goalkeeper did well. I thought he\u2019d go down and I forgot he\u2019s a keeper who is two metres tall and that\u2019s why I failed. But I\u2019m improving and this is the important thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
