What would you have for your last supper? An ice-cream sundae. What foodstuff would you put in Room 101? Truffles - they're overrated. What's your favourite table? Tom Aiken's. What's your poison? Vodka. Which book gets you cooking? Practical Cookery by John Campell, David Foskett and Victor Ceserani. What's your dream dinner party line-up? Elvis and Eddie Murphy. What was your childhood teatime treat? Cheese and apples or mashed bananas with sugar and cream. What would you cook to impress a date? Whatever she wanted. Who would you most like to cook for? The love of my life. I am yet to find her. What was your most memorable meal? Aged 10 or 11, we had gone skiing and I visited my first Michelin-starred restaurant. I had steak and chips. The steak was amazingly tender and the chips were hand-cut ones, done to perfection. It was amazing. What was your biggest food disaster? My college threw a graduate dinner party where we got to cook and show off what we'd learned. I was in charge of producing a lemon mousse for dessert. Everything was going well until it separated an hour before serving. No one was very happy with me. What's the worst meal you've ever had? Rubbery kidneys in a steak and kidney pie. My mate's mother cooked it and I wasn't allowed to leave the table until I'd finished it. What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? I don't really go for outlandish food. I know what I like and that's what I eat. Who's your food hero/food villain? My mother is my food hero and I don't have a villain. Nigella or Delia? Delia. Vegetarians: genius or madness? Madness. Muesli or fry-up? Muesli. More specifically, granola. Starter or pudding? Starter. Fast food or fresh food? Fresh food. Fusion food or Best of British? Best of British. What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? The best thing is that Britain now has a reputation for producing great local food. The worst thing is narrow-minded tourists thinking that our diet is limited to fish and chips [Ed: Isn't this a bit rich coming from the co-owner of a chippy?]. What's the next big thing? All-day breakfast. What would you do if you weren't a chef? Travel the world. Make a wish I'd like to take two months off and go travelling. \u00b7 Rob Aiken and his twin brother Tom own Tom's Kitchen and Tom's Place"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
