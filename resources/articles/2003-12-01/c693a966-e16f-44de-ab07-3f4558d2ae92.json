There were suckling satyrs, drunken demi-gods and Wisdom in her armour. There was fleshy pleasure. There was also bony realpolitik, the geography of a Europe divided by religion, contained in the frames. During the counter Reformation, art was propaganda and Rubens was an old master of both. Knighted by both Philip IV of Spain and England's own Charles I, Rubens was clearly as adept with a soft flannel as he was with a paintbrush. Collings' keenness on the way the artist created \"cosmic explosive action\" from \"little wispy patches of brushy melting nothingness\" was contagious, and his portrait of Peter Paul, master of Steen, was both epic and detailed. It was baroque and roll (though I am more of a Caravaggio man myself). A generation later - in Charles II - The Power and the Passion (BBC1, Sunday) - there was quite the conflagration. 'Twas 1666 and thus time for the Great Fire of London. History moves at quite a pace. It seems hardly any time at all since the Great Plague. And so the CGI flames swept through the streets of London, further convincing us that the inferno should be the next Large Historical Event turned into a BBC multimedia extravaganza a la Pompeii (despite lacking the overseas sales potential of Vesuvius). There were religious zealots urging down the rain of fire. There were weary, simple folks watching their hovels blister and burn. There were wide-eyed urchins with no windows left against which to squash their famished faces. The stories to be told were manifold. Among them strode the king in what looked like a highly flammable, and hence ill-advised, wig. Charles, the message was clear, was a monarch willing to get his scalp singed to save the city. No fiddling while his Rome burned. Of course, it didn't take long for him to resume fiddling - this time with playhouse creature, Nell Gwynne - but there were other things to consider. Before the ashes were cold, the sooty mob were blaming Papists and threatening a flare-up of a different kind. One of the king's advisers, most likely that bounder Buckingham, suggested they blame the Quakers instead. For a second, you thought he might just be on to something. The mob was nothing compared with the Countess of Castlemaine. Rejected and ejected, she sailed furiously out of Charles's court, disappearing into bright white light, like a silken tornado. Upon her eviction, she warned a footman: \"Touch as much as a candlestick and I will cut off your hands and hang them round your neck.\" This was surprisingly restrained. I had her down as more of a \"bollocks for earrings\" girl, but she had already bitten off a dead bishop's bits so was, perhaps, somewhat replete. Charles II will be a duller drama without Helen McCrory's electrifying presence. Without her, we were left to muse upon the strange familiarity of Charles's story. Intent on finding justification for a war demanded by a rich ally where there was none, Charles and his advisers were insistent: \"What parliament does not know need not trouble it.\" Their collective responsibility didn't last long and soon some of Charles's most trusted lieutenants were resigning, warning of continuing with such \"risky adventures\". This is not a tale that ends well. In the absence of really funny, biting satire on television, we make do with Bremner, Bird and Fortune: Trust Me, I'm a Prime Minister (Channel 4, Sunday). It's quite funny sometimes and often bares its teeth. But it's not as funny as it might be, nor as ravenous. Still, it does its best to show Tony Blair as a hypocritical megalomaniac with a messianic complex - amoral at best and immoral at worst - sitting atop a corrupt and undemocratic system of government. It might be that New Labour is beyond parody and therefore trickier to satirise. Bremner would surely have dismissed David Blunkett's \"King Herod\" plans for the children of asylum seekers as too outrageous. The Big Conversation deemed too stupid - a Frankensteinian focus group run amok across the country: Attack of the Monster Opinion Poll! Or, as Bremner suggested, it might be us. We don't have the appetite for satire. In our consumer democracy, lies are more comforting. We have lost our taste for truth. Another unhappy ending."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
