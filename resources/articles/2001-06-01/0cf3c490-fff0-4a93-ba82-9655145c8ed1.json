Their boyish features and second-hand suits have appeared everywhere from style magazines to the front cover of NME. Last time they performed in Oxford it was to fewer than 100 people; this time the capacity crowd is at least five times larger and includes half of Radiohead, Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield and Kate Moss. As one girl at the front pertly comments, \"They're not ours any more.\" Whether all this is healthy for the impossibly young quintet (all born in the early 1980s) is a moot point. This sold-out tour feels like the last time the New Yorkers will play such tiny venues, but their set - 11 songs blasted out in little more than half an hour - clearly isn't ready for anything bigger yet. And so much of their charm lies in their ability to create a bewitching intimacy with their audience, with frontman Julian Casablancas stroking the head of a man who crowd-surfs and blowing a kiss at a girl who throws him a cigarette. For the moment, though, they are living up to the hype. To watch them, to see Casablancas clutch excitedly at his jacket and pout into the mike while Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jnr coolly attack their guitars, is to reel with innocent elation, to regress to those adolescent moments when nothing could be more blissful than pogoing to a propulsive punk rhythm. The thrill when the band play songs from first album The Modern Age is palpable, electrifying. This is exuberant, even cheeky music, and the Strokes play it with bumptious panache. They acknowledge without embarrassment every debt to the likes of Velvet Underground and Television, and aren't daunted by a terrible sound system that grazes the pop melodies so they emerge bruised and serrated and that sometimes smothers Casablancas's voice in rubble. They end with a roaring number called Take It or Leave It; Valensi hands out beers at the front and a beaming Casablancas tells the audience, \"You guys are so fucking cool.\" Perhaps that's the greatest magic of the Strokes: they make us feel part of the story. They need to maintain that if they're going to survive. \u0095 The Strokes play Club Ifor Bach, Cardiff (029-2023 2199), tonight, then tour."}, "isHosted": false}}}
