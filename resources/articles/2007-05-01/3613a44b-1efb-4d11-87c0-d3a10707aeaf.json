Gloucester's defence had no answer to the power of the Leicester wings, Seru Rabeni and Alesana Tuilagi, as they leaked seven tries in a one-sided final, but the New Zealander Vainikolo's record with the Bulls is exceptional, 143 tries in 146 appearances, while he has claimed 14 in 12 Tests. \"I have had a memorable time at Bradford,\" said Vainikolo, who will join Gloucester on July 1, \"and I will be giving everything for the club over the next six weeks, but I am proud to be joining a side of Gloucester's reputation. I know I could not be at a better place to learn about union.\" Gloucester's director of rugby Dean Ryan, not one given to overstatement, described the signing as one of the most exciting in the club's history, saying: \"Lesley has the potential to be a world-class player in union. We had informal discussions with him a couple of years ago, and when we heard his desire to play for us was strong, we moved quickly. The modern game requires power and pace and he brings us both.\" Llanelli Scarlets yesterday signed the Wales and Saracens prop Ben Broster while Worcester's new head coach, Mike Ruddock, made his first capture since taking over from John Brain earlier this month when he landed Waterloo's former Natal prop, Shaun Ruwers. The Harlequins' director of rugby Dean Richards yesterday extended his contract by three years to keep him at The Stoop until 2011, which should end speculation linking him with a post with England after the autumn World Cup. \"I'm very excited about the developments at Quins, as well as being confident about building on our encouraging return to the top flight this season,\" said the former Leicester coach. Scotland's prop Euan Murray will join relegated Northampton next season, despite a get-out clause in his contract which allowed him to abort the move from Glasgow if the Saints lost their Premiership status. \"Euan's arrival is a statement of intent both by the club and also Euan as a player, demonstrating his commitment in building a strong future at the Saints,\" said the Northampton director of recruitment James Sinclair. \"Our squad is strong for next season but we still have two or three key signings to announce over the next few weeks. The London Irish prop Neil Hatley will lead England Saxons in their Churchill Cup match against the United States at Edgeley Park tomorrow. Shane Geraghty starts at inside-centre with Gloucester's Ryan Lamb offered a quick chance of redemption at outside-half after struggling against Tuilagi in the Premiership final. \"England Saxons is a great experience,\" said Hatley. \"It takes players out of their comfort zone, you've got to fit in quickly, which is great practice for everyone. Australia are considering omitting the wing Lote Tuqiri from their two-Test series against Wales, which starts at the end of the month, fearing he has lost pace. He has been given a conditioning programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
