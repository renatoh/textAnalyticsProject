But only one is sure to be heard as far as Stonehenge: a song about \u201cjealousy/Turning saints into the sea\u201d. The Killers\u2019 Mr Brightside only reached No 10 in the UK on its second release in 2004 (it didn\u2019t chart at all when first released) \u2013 the band\u2019s other hits Somebody Told Me, Human and When You Were Young all reached the top three. It had no big film, TV or advertising boost \u2013 its most significant crossover moment is soundtracking Cameron Diaz\u2019s sozzled singing session in The Holiday. Yet Mr Brightside became the longest-charting song in UK history, having appeared in the top 100 for a total of 208 weeks, 42 more than its closest competitor. No other track from before 2016 has been streamed more. It\u2019s a karaoke favourite \u2013 Ed Balls chose to mark his defeat in the 2010 Labour leadership race with a rendition \u2013 and a fixture of weddings, student nights, indie discos and, yes, waterlogged British festivals. So how did a 16-year-old synthpop song by a Vegas indie band become a British anthem? Perhaps because it was expressly engineered to mimic one. Despite growing up in the Nevada desert, Killers frontman Brandon Flowers spent his youth obsessing over British bands of the 80s and 90s (the band\u2019s name is taken from New Order\u2019s video for Crystal). Indulging in the relatively niche fandom of these bands felt, says Flowers, like \u201ca very personal experience\u201d. But in 2001 he attended an Oasis show that seemed \u201ccommunal \u2013 it was the first time I felt that. There was some strange sort of spirituality.\u201d Bowled over by the mass euphoria, he set himself a new goal. \u201cI wanted to write an answer to Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger, which is a strange aspiration for a 20-year-old,\u201d he says. Creating a song that had the Gallaghers\u2019 knack for initiating impassioned group singalongs would mean channelling an emotional state both uniquely poignant and universally relatable. Fortunately, some suitable material soon arrived: the girlfriend who had accompanied Flowers to the Oasis gig ended their relationship, so he poured his first heartbreak into the first song the Killers ever wrote. \u201cThe wound was raw,\u201d he says, \u201cso it was cathartic for me. There was still something really romantic about it: it was before phones. I actually put pen to paper and we were able to turn that into something universal. To make betrayal sound so good was just a lucky thing that I stumbled upon.\u201d He had a grab bag of musical inspirations, too. \u201cWhen I look back at it now, I see little things that helped,\u201d he says. \u201cI Feel You by Depeche Mode \u2013 and Pet Shop Boys have a song called Jealousy that I love.\u201d Another big influence was Queen Bitch by David Bowie. \u201cI almost stole it \u2013 but I didn\u2019t quite.\u201d Armed with ideas, Flowers wrote Mr Brightside by driving around Las Vegas singing over a cassette tape of bandmate Dave Keuning\u2019s guitar sketches. Fittingly, Spotify says it is now the song that appears most frequently on road trip-related playlists. But why that title? Flowers shrugs. \u201cIt was just something I came up with.\u201d The Killers first appeared during an era once christened the \u201cnew rock revolution\u201d \u2013 the 00s resurgence of guitar bands, from the Strokes to Arctic Monkeys. Conor McNicholas, who edited NME between 2003 and 2009, put the full weight of his magazine\u2019s influence behind the Killers. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasise how disruptive it was for a band to turn up and openly play keyboards,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just felt like a dangerous idea at the time.\u201d The group\u2019s popularity, however, is down to them not actually being very dangerous at all. \u201cThey had this fantastic mainstream appeal, because there was nothing not to like,\u201d says McNicholas, who believes the song encapsulates this universal charm. \u201cIt has become this lingua franca between lots of different people that are into different stuff.\u201d The new rock revolution was the last time rock music doubled as the zeitgeist. Steve Lamacq was an early champion of Mr Brightside on the then-fledgling BBC 6Music, and thinks the genre\u2019s decline might have something to do with the song\u2019s long-haul appeal. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that rousing sort of rock\u2019n\u2019roll that\u2019s absent these days,\u201d he says, which leaves Mr Brightside as \u201cone of the surviving great anthems that has never been replaced\u201d. This popularity is due to it being fit for practically any occasion. As an indie song that both wallows in feelings of rejection and imbues them with euphoria, it works just as well in an insular, headphone bubble as the multi-generational dancefloor of a wedding reception, or the blokey bonding of the football terraces. McNicholas notes its party-starting potential, pointing out that the song is \u201cfantastically upbeat. It\u2019s got this on-beat thing, which sounds a bit like the Marseillaise. It operates on the one, the two, the three and the four beat, which is just bananas. It becomes a song you can\u2019t ignore.\u201d Its 208 weeks on the UK chart eclipse the 38 it notched on the US Billboard top 100. Why do Brits particularly love it? Flowers says it\u2019s down to the \u201clineage\u201d between the Killers and a host of celebrated British artists. \u201cBritish people must feel the influences, and we\u2019ve never been quiet about where those influences came from. Oasis, the Pet Shop Boys, David Bowie, the Cure, the Smiths, and all that stuff I loved growing up \u2013 I think you can hear all those things in it.\u201d Mr Brightside\u2019s trajectory is indicative of the way the modern music industry works: it has spread through playlist culture, to which its chameleonic, largely inoffensive nature is uniquely suited. It is on playlists because it is popular, and it is popular because it is on playlists. But its popularity boils down to something less technical and more human: the combination of melodrama and euphoria has lent it a deeply personal sense of time, place and meaning that will only intensify. Zane Lowe remembers frequently playing the song in clubs in his indie disco DJ days, \u201cjust to get that adrenaline rush of watching people sing it back at you. Every time, you could see that it was giving them a moment. And those moments become something that you hold dear to you.\u201d The intensity of that kind of musical interaction is what gives a song its longevity, agrees Lamacq. \u201cThose people will take that record with them until their dying day. Another 1,000 weeks on the chart later, it will probably end up being the biggest funeral song of a generation.\u201d Flowers is sanguine about the fact that it will be sung louder than any other Killers songs when the band play the Pyramid stage on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. If we didn\u2019t have other songs that people respond to, it would be different. But it is amazing. Having a song like that is every band\u2019s dream.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
