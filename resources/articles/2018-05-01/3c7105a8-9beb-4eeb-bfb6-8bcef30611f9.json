Lauren Zhang, who lives and studies in Birmingham, competed against 18-year-old saxophonist Robert Burton and 18-year-old cellist Maxim Calver to win the title in the 40th year of the competition. She performed Prokofiev\u2019s 2nd Piano Concerto in G minor, op.16 with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. The judges praised her performance of a hugely challenging and ambitious work: \u201cHer exceptional level of technical skill and intelligent musicality shone through in a beast of a piece,\u201d said Kerry Andrew, chair of the judging panel. \u201cShe has a natural genuine musicianship \u2026 and a real intelligence,\u201d said violinist and previous winner Nicola Benedetti. Lauren said: \u201cI\u2019m astonished \u2026 I can\u2019t quite believe it! It\u2019s been a fantastic opportunity to play with the CBSO and the journey right from the start of the competition has been incredible.\u201d Lauren is currently studying for her GCSEs at King Edward VI High School for Girls \u2013 she has three exams on Tuesday \u2013 and also attends the Birmingham Junior Conservatoire. She began learning the piano at the age of four and also plays the violin. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Lauren and her family moved to Birmingham in 2010. At the Junior Conservatoire she is taught by Robert Markham, who himself was a finalist in the BBC Young Musician competition in 1986. Principal of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Julian Lloyd Webber said: \u201cHaving spent a lifetime making music with some of the world\u2019s finest musicians I can honestly say that Lauren is up there with the best \u2013 she is a total phenomenon.\u201d She is a compelling performer, said concert pianist Tom Poster, one of the judges in the keyboard final. \u201cAs she played, there was an electricity in the room. People were really listening.\u201d Judging Sunday\u2019s final alongside Andrew were conductor Alpesh Chauhan, cellist Natalie Clein, saxophonist John Harle and pianist Sunwook Kim. Also at Birmingham\u2019s Symphony Hall to hand over the trophy, and perform himself for the audience while the judges conferred, was 2016\u2019s winner Sheku Kanneh-Mason. His 15-year-old sister Jeneba was one of this year\u2019s keyboard category finalists. Lauren will be performing on the BBC Radio 3 stage at BBC Music\u2019s The Biggest Weekend in Coventry on 28 May and at the Young Musician 40th anniversary concert at the Proms on 15 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
