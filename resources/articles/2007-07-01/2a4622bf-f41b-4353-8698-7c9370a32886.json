On 43 he sloppily slapped a catch to point, again raising questions about his Test future and leaving him with just two fifties in his last 18 innings.....\" How easily those words might have flowed this morning, indeed too easily for those seemingly seeking to take a hatchet to Strauss's career. Except, of course, that he was not out for 43. He did hit Sri Sreesanth to Dinesh Karthik when he was on that score, but inexplicably the fielder grassed the chance. Easier opportunities have rarely been spurned at this level. Strauss had presented a similar gift to the West Indians during the Test here in May. On 33 he drove at Daren Powell and on that occasion the fielder Devon Smith held on to the catch securely. There was a minor difference in that Smith was positioned just behind square at backward point whereas Karthik, the reserve wicketkeeper, was standing dead level with Strauss on the popping crease. But the common denominator in both cases was Strauss's poor shot execution - leaning back on a cover drive so that the ball was almost bound to find an aerial curve rather than scorching across the turf as intended, indeed desired. And at the time yesterday it appeared a shot indicative of his lack of fluency. England had been proffered a flying start by the Indian seamers doing passable impressions of myopic sheep, such was their lack of direction. But it was Alastair Cook who benefited with the greater flourish, as ever missing nothing off his legs. In contrast, Strauss showed affection for the third-man boundary, three early drives skewing towards that untenanted area. Indeed, it was only after he clipped RP Singh cleanly through mid-wicket and then advanced into the forties with a smooth cover-drive off Zaheer Khan that he might have felt any hint of comfort. Maybe that was the problem, because then came the drop and, fortunately, lunch soon afterwards. Strauss walked off smiling. The break was a welcome opportunity both to reflect upon his fortune and also to plot cashing in on it. England's batsmen in general are rather good at that at Lord's. Of the top six selected here, the least successful in terms of average is the captain, Michael Vaughan, but even his is 54 and he has scored five centuries here. And to think they used to say that England's cricketers never performed at Lord's. The top six have 16 centuries between them. It would have been Strauss's fourth Test hundred here yesterday if he had made the four more precious runs required. For, to general surprise after he had batted sedately and surely through the afternoon session into the evening, he was dismissed in the nineties for only the second time in his Test career. He scored 90 against West Indies at Old Trafford in 2004 but otherwise he has been recognised as one of the best converters of fifties to hundreds in the world game, evidenced by his record of 10 fifties and 10 hundreds. Another reputation he has is that of a batsman keen to rush to a century once in the vicinity. Such personal milestones should not affect a batsman's tempo or method, but the reality is that they do. Very few batsmen will say otherwise. Whether it is irrational or not, batting in the 90s is an art form all of its own. And, in general, Strauss has been pretty damn good at it. But yesterday he got it wrong. He had just moved to 96 with a delicate tickle to fine leg for four off Anil Kumble. There followed three dot balls, with Strauss's mind no doubt planning a swift conclusion to his and everyone else's wait for the century. The \"grand manner\" is an appealing cliche to all batsmen. Next ball, he began advancing down the pitch in pursuit of it. But his mistake was that he made his move too early. Kumble, in his delivery stride, doubtless noticed this. He instantly determined upon firing the ball to Strauss's off side, probably fancying a stumping. Completely flummoxed, Strauss's only reaction was a desperate prod into Rahul Dravid's hands at slip. Still, after Karthik's blunder, he could not be too disappointed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
