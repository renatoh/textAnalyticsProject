I am in my late 50s, single and work full time. She has problems with a degenerative condition, but still drives and has a good social life; there is nothing wrong with her mind. She is proud and independent. We have never got on well. I am an only child, so I look after things when her health is not good. She doesn't want to move nearer to me and her grandchildren, and I respect that, but it makes things difficult, not least because I spend days with her, rather than a couple of hours, which is intense and stressful. My problem is that I have recently withdrawn from her. I am conscious of this. She said: \"You don't share things with me any more.\" I can't deny it. I am crying as I write this. The relationship works like this: when we spend time together, she will be warm and welcoming, but then she pushes me away by a word or a look. Then near to my departure, she will shower me with kindness. Push, pull. I may be withdrawing because I don't trust her any more. It feels as if I just can't allow her back in. I dread ringing her and visiting. When I see her, I work on chores, to keep away from her and because of a strong urge to help. I feel desperately sorry for her. She is very full-on and doesn't, or won't, back off when things are becoming difficult. The more I withdraw, the more intense she becomes: it is a vicious circle. She is an amazing woman, very strong, has lots of friends, and is funny, generous and intelligent. R, via email Do you know what the number one subject matter in my mail bag is? Adults not getting on with their mothers, and all the angst it causes. I have picked your letter to answer, but really it could do for all the others too. The relationship one has with one's mother is the most primal, the most important, the most influential. It is meant to be wonderful, synergistic, loving. But often it is not. When it is not, the child \u2013 even as an adult \u2013 can go to extraordinary lengths to create the \"ideal\" mother-child relationship. Even among the anger and disappointment, your letter is full of all the good points about your mother, lest I think badly of her. It's OK. She isn't perfect; you're not. But what matters is how to make the last part of your relationship as good as it can be without it costing you too much. As you both get older, two things are happening: you are becoming angrier at not having had the mother-daughter relationship you wanted and you are realising that time is running out for you both. You are panicking because you want every visit to be perfect. I spoke to Nicola Barden, a psychotherapist (bacp.co.uk) and head of counselling at the University of Portsmouth. She said your problem is very common and observed that you seem to regress to a \"childhood state while your mother seems to regress to an overprotective parental role when your relationship becomes difficult\". You both seem to start off with really good intentions, but along the line it goes wrong. Remember, no matter how grown up and senior in our lives/jobs we are, with our parents, we all have the ability to react like children. Barden also thought that perhaps something in your behaviour made your mother feel like a bad mother (this isn't said in blame), and I also wondered if something in her behaviour made you feel like a bad daughter? And thus it goes on and on \u2026 Barden said that, on some level, you both \"like and respect each other. Try to accept your irritation without trying to fix things.\" She recommended something called \"mindfulness\", where you observe without becoming emotional (you may also find the book Mindfulness by Mark Williams and Danny Penman useful). I could do with being able to do this! She also wondered where the pressure came from to have this \"perfect\" relationship, or at least one that is different from the one you have? \"It's often the motive you attribute to someone's behaviour that is more important than the behaviour itself.\" I think this is the key line for you. Stop trying to make your relationship with your mother perfect and, if you can, (I note the geographical distance between you), Barden recommends visiting her more often but for less time, so things don't escalate.
