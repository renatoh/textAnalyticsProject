In the eight weeks since the bank's near collapse it has borrowed about \u00a320bn from the Bank of England rescue fund to support its mortgage lending. Experts predicted the Newcastle-based bank would need another injection of funds next month, pushing the total borrowed beyond \u00a325bn. The bank's advisers are seeking potential bidders who could assume control of Northern Rock and its \u00a3110bn worth of mortgages. They are understood to have contacted several banks in China and the far east. Some reports said more than 50 banks were approached with details of Northern Rock's finances with the aim of prompting a flurry of bids. The bank is talking to three potential bidders, including private equity firm JC Flowers and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, about a takeover. However, the groups indicated their interest several weeks ago and some analysts believe they are unlikely to pursue a takeover, leaving Northern Rock to be put into administration. Bidders are understood to face several barriers, including a withdrawal of savings from Northern Rock which is understood to have taken more than \u00a310bn from its previous deposit base of about \u00a324bn. Shares in Northern Rock tumbled in early trading to below 140p before rallying to leave the bank down 2p at 150p. At the beginning of the year its shares were worth more than \u00a312 each. In a separate move HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, said it had stopped selling and trading mortgage-backed securities in the US as part of 120 job cuts in its investment bank unit. The securities, many of which are believed to be contaminated with sub-prime loans sold over the last three years, lie at the heart of the credit crunch that sparked Northern Rock's near collapse and continues to grip international money markets. HSBC said 100 of the job cuts would be in the US with the others going in Britain. The bank closed its US sub-prime mortgage unit - Decision One - in September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
