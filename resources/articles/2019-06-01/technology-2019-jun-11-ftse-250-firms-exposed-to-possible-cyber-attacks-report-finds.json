According to the cybersecurity company Rapid7\u2019s report, created by scanning for systems and devices used by FTSE 250 corporations that are visible on the public internet, the 35 different \u201cattack surfaces \u2026 [are] neither good nor bad, but each exposed node \u2026 potentially boosts the opportunity for attackers to gain a foothold. \u201cTo put it another way, each exposed server or device must be properly configured, managed, patched and defended to reduce the risk of a cyber-attack.\u201d Unfortunately, \u201cFTSE 250+ organisations in every sector had serious issues with patch/version management of business-critical internet-facing systems\u201d, the report said. Most of Britain\u2019s largest companies, Rapid7 found, \u201care running older and often unsupported versions of the three most prolific web servers\u201d \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s IIS and the open source Apache and nginx services. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that organisations keep an up-to-date inventory of what they\u2019re exposing and work to ensure they are using supported and patched version of software,\u201d Rapid7 said. Keeping older versions of popular software packages on the internet can pose serious risks to organisational security. The software vulnerability that lay at the heart of the WannaCry outbreak had been fixed months before the ransomware took down a chunk of the internet and paralysed the NHS, but many organisations had been unable to update their software in time. Last week, the US National Security Agency issued a public security advisory warning Windows users to update to the latest version due to a security flaw known as BlueKeep, which affects a number of older versions of Windows and could potentially be used to create self-spreading malware similar to WannaCry. In 2016, Rapid7 carried out a similar project to scan the internet for vulnerabilities, but focused on the national scale. It found Belgium topped the list of nations most vulnerable to hacking, due to the number of insecure connections hosted from the country\u2019s IP addresses. Tajikistan came second, and Samoa third."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
