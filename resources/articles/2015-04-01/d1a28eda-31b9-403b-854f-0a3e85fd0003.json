Real Madrid are monitoring the Spaniard\u2019s position and may attempt to buy him this summer. De Gea has enjoyed an outstanding season for United and is the club\u2019s only nominee for the PFA player of the year award. His current contract expires at the end of next season and Van Gaal acknowledged the longer fresh terms are not agreed the more in balance De Gea\u2019s future is. \u201cIt takes a long time now,\u201d said the manager. \u201cSo it can always happen. I am not the boss. I want him to stay. The player is the boss \u2013 he can say yes or no. You will have to ask David de Gea, not me. He has to sign. We have offered him a lot of money.\u201d The deal is believed to be in the region of \u00a3150,000 a week with lucrative incentives. Van Gaal admitted in general terms players often hold the power. Asked whether he would like to complete his signings before pre-season starts, the Dutchman said: \u201cWe have to wait and see, it\u2019s dependable on the market. We shall also sell players and that\u2019s dependable on the market. It\u2019s not so easy to finalise all the decisions you are making because the players are the boss, not the manager. Every time you read in the papers that I buy that player or that player or have communicated with that player, it is not like that. At the end the player has to decide and not the manager and not the manager of the selling club.\u201d Van Gaal said Marouane Fellaini was now one of United\u2019s dominant players, the Belgian having emerged as a driving force after being a peripheral figure under David Moyes last season. \u201cI am always communicating with my players about philosophy, performance, attitude, behaviour and maybe one or two aspects more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is what I\u2019m doing and not more than that. And when players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities. So I think Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let dominate the qualities of Fellaini in the team and I believe we are doing that. That\u2019s why his performances are better now.\u201d Van Gaal has no concern about Fellaini being potentially targeted by Everton on his return to his former club on Sunday. \u201cI have spoken with Fellaini because I know this,\u201d the manager said. \u201cFellaini is always dry in his answers. He said: \u2018It\u2019s a game\u2019. \u2018Yes but it\u2019s a special game for you\u2019. I hope the fans receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata [last week] because I like that very much. I hope it\u2019s like that.\u201d Van Gaal refused to discuss whether he has had contact with PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Memphis Depay. \u201cI don\u2019t discuss it with the media, you know my answer,\u201d he said of the winger who played under the Dutchman for Holland at last summer\u2019s World Cup. \u201cI have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I\u2019ve coached already.\u201d Van Gaal also said Robin van Persie faces a fight to regain his place following injury. \u201cHe has to train very hard and play in the second team [earlier this week] and show his qualities again. Then I have to compare him with the players in that position. It\u2019s always the same.\u201d Only Daley Blind of United\u2019s injured players may be available for Everton. \u201cAll the players are still injured. Only Blind maybe \u2013 it\u2019s a question mark \u2013 can reach the game against Everton. Jones, Carrick and Rojo cannot play against Everton,\u201d Van Gaal said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
