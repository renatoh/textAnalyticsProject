Walter Smith's team may remain the lowest goalscorers left in the Uefa Cup but they still harbour legitimate aspirations of glory at the City of Manchester Stadium on May 14. It was noticeable long before full-time that both of these teams were content to settle for a scoreless first leg, Fiorentina being the latest side unable to breach Rangers' resistance at Ibrox. The Scots are yet to concede at home in this competition and, with key players due to return for the second leg on Thursday, Rangers will travel to Florence with confidence, buoyed by recent triumphs in Lyon, Athens, Bremen and Lisbon. \"There is always a first time,\" said Cesare Pandrelli, Fiorentina's manager, when asked whether he was concerned that Rangers have progressed through the Uefa Cup with all of their second legs outside Scotland. Put into its proper context, this can be regarded as a more impressive result than that of the other home team in the semi-finals, Bayern Munich, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Zenit St Petersburg. \"They'll be slight favourites to go through at home but that has been the case in all the European games we have played this season,\" said Smith. \"We basically stuck to what we were trying to achieve. Not conceding an away goal gives us an opportunity.\" Rangers' foreign sojourns began 17 matches and nine months ago in the qualifying phase of the Champions League, so it was bad luck indeed that all Smith's selection problems should arrive at once. Suspensions to Kevin Thomson and Barry Ferguson, the captain, would have represented sufficient concern to the manager without the injuries collected by Allan McGregor, Chris Burke, Steven Naismith and Lee McCulloch within the previous eight days. Matters were almost compounded by Christian Dailly, who needed a late fitness test to confirm his availability for this first leg. Fiorentina had no such troubles with their combative captain, Tomas Ujfalusi, and the three-pronged attack of Mario Santana, Giampaolo Pazzini and Adrian Mutu in fine fettle. Only the desperate interventions of Carlos Cu\u00e9llar prevented Pazzini from sending the visitors in front within 13 minutes. Cu\u00e9llar, normally the left-sided half of a central defensive partnership with David Weir, had been deployed on the right in an attempt to combat Mutu's pace. The tactic served its purpose. La Viola's return to prominence in Italy has not so much been gradual as spectacular. After the ignominy of bankruptcy and demotion to the fourth league tier in 2002, they were involved in the match-fixing scandal of two years ago. Currently fourth in Serie A, Fiorentina's recovery is testament to the collective abilities of Prandelli and his youthful squad. Yet European glory has eluded the Florentines since they defeated Rangers over two legs in the inaugural Cup Winners' Cup final of 1961. It took a sluggish Rangers 15 minutes to mount a real foray into opposition territory but it came agonisingly close to paying off. Jean-Claude Darcheville, the lone striker, embarked on an unchallenged, 40-yard run with the Frenchman's eventual shot almost sliced into his own net by Alessandro Gamberini. But that proved a rare break-out as Prandelli's team dominated possession; even small rewards such as a throw-in were rapturously received by the home fans. Mutu and Santana combined superbly six minutes before the interval, with only the interventions of Neil Alexander in the home goal preventing an away goal. While Rangers displayed more attacking verve in the first 10 minutes of the second period than in the previous 45, the pattern of Darcheville being isolated continued. He was promptly withdrawn, along with Nacho Novo, as Smith introduced Thomas Buffel and Daniel Cousin. For their part Fiorentina were increasingly reluctant to flood forward in the manner which had lit up the game's early exchanges when Prandelli had waved his players forward at every available opportunity. Mutu tested Alexander with a cleanly-struck shot from a set-piece from 30 yards which the goalkeeper held firmly before the Romanian striker passed up arguably the best chance of the match in the dying seconds by miskicking as Rangers failed to clear their lines. Rather than illustrate an occasion of missed opportunities, Mutu's profligacy merely hinted that epic drama may well follow in Tuscany."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
