The Englishman blundered badly for both Charlie Adam's goals, underlining why John Collins, the Hibs manager, urgently needs to invest in a reliable keeper. The result means that Celtic will be unable to gain an unassailable lead over their city rivals by winning Sunday's Old Firm match but the fact that Gordon Strachan's team now have the chance to clinch a second successive league title on March 18 is a further blow to Hibs - they face Kilmarnock in the CIS Cup final on that date but attention will now be split between Hampden and Celtic's trip to Falkirk. Hibs were unusually flat in the first half here and, though Rangers dominated possession, they failed to create many meaningful chances. Adam's opening goal was notable primarily for the poor positioning of Brown and a swirling wind which aided the ball's flight into the net from virtually the right touchline. From such an angle, though, and 25 yards from goal, the goalkeeper was undoubtedly culpable. Attention during the remainder of the first half centred on Kevin Thomson, the 22-year-old midfielder who left Hibs for Rangers in acrimonious circumstances in January. The Edinburgh club received \u00a32m from his sale but words have since been exchanged in public between him and Collins and his every touch was booed by the home support here. Hibs started the second period brightly, aided by the introduction of Abdessalam Benjelloun, which made Brown's second aberration all the more damaging. This time Adam was in a central position but again 25 yards from goal when handed a free-kick, which he struck straight at the goalkeeper only for Brown to allow the ball to squirm through his hands and between his legs. \"He has said sorry; that's all he can do,\" said Collins afterwards. \"We were looking for a goalkeeper but they are not easy to find. We will keep looking.\" Reports yesterday suggested that the Northern Ireland Assembly member David Burnside is putting together a consortium to buy out Rangers' owner, David Murray, but it is understood Murray has no interest in selling at this time and Burnside admits he has not yet secured funding.
