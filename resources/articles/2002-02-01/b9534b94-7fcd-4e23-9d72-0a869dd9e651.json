I would then expect a statement next week to announce that everything has been agreed.\" Ferguson also disclosed that David Beckham had suffered nothing more than severe bruising when he hurt an ankle in England's 1-1 draw with Holland on Wednesday, and the midfielder should be available for the Champions League encounter with Nantes on Wednesday. \"There is a lot of difference between bruising and ligament damage or a muscular strain,\" said Ferguson. \"Beckham will be OK.\" \u00b7 Blackburn will today meet the Turkey international Hakan Unsal after agreeing an undisclosed fee for the left-sided midfielder. \"My club Galatasaray have found an agreement with Blackburn and I will talk with the Rovers board this weekend,\" Hakan said. \"If I reach an agreement as well I will be able to start playing with my old team-mate Tugay again.\" However, Aston Villa have also been tracking Hakan and may attempt to hijack the deal. \u00b7 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is considering whether to discipline Lauren for his late return from the African Nations Cup. The Arsenal manager had emphasised the importance of returning on time to his players after Nwankwo Kanu went awol following the 2000 tournament. The Nigerian striker flew in from Mali as scheduled on Monday, but Lauren was not expected back until late last night. Arsenal had to contact the Cameroon authorities to establish Lauren's whereabouts and he will not be available for today's FA Cup fifth-round tie with Gillingham. \"Lauren was apparently requested, along with the other players, to get on a plane and meet the president of Cameroon before being paraded with the trophy,\" said Wenger. \"I'm really delighted about that, as you can imagine. We were surprised as Lauren is a serious player and focused.\" \u00b7 Leeds's reserve goalkeeper Paul Robinson has signed a new deal that will keep him at Elland Road until 2006. \u00b7 Everton's Danny Cadamarteri will appear in court on Wednesday charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. It follows last September's trial, when he was found guilty of assaulting a lap dancer. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
