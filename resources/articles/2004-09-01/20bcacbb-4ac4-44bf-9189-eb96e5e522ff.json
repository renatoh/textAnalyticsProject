The National Union of Students said it was disappointed that the Schwartz review was recommending additional American-style tests, which would favour those who could afford coaching, and continued to focus on A-levels. Its plea for an independent body to monitor what universities were doing was ignored. Among university heads there was relief that they will retain responsibility for their own admissions. Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, welcomed the move to applications after exam results in principle, but will scrutinise the details of any replacement system that is likely to affect the start of the university term as well as the date of A-levels and Scottish Highers. Higher education colleges were concerned that interviews for drama, art and teacher training courses will have to be accommodated, although they are also in favour of a post qualification admissions (PQA) system. NUS vice-president for education, Hannah Essex, said: \"NUS believes applicants should be assessed on their potential rather than simply grades. Students' abilities often stretch beyond the grade, and we believe that a more holistic approach should be taken when assessing student ability in order to improve access for those from less traditional backgrounds. [American] Sat tests give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to pay for coaching or are lucky enough to go to a school which would provide adequate preparation for these tests. \"NUS is disappointed that our recommendations for an independent body to monitor institutions and promote good practice have not been met. However, we support plans for a centre of expertise on admissions and hope that this might take on more of a monitoring and evaluating role in ensuring a fair process for all. It's frustrating that the first task of the centre is likely to be researching national admissions testing,\" she added. The president of UUK, Professor Ivor Crewe, said the principles outlined in the Schwartz review provided a solid foundation for institutions looking to enhance good practice in their admissions policies. He also welcomed the appointment of Sir Alan Wilson, the government's director general of higher education and former vice-chancellor of Leeds, to lead the move to a PQA system. Professor Crewe gave a guarded reaction to the proposed \"central source of expertise\" to assist universities with admissions procedures and the idea of a \"national test of potential\". Professor Dianne Willcocks, principal of York St John College and chairwoman of the Standing Conference of Principals (Scop), said a well structured post qualifications system would provide greater security for institutions and give students, both 18-year-olds and mature students, the best possible opportunity of presenting their academic and real world strengths to the full. The system must take account of the need for interviews, auditions and portfolio assessment for certain degree courses, including teacher training, art and design, drama and the performing arts, and the health professions, and that these could take place in a reasonable timescale, she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
