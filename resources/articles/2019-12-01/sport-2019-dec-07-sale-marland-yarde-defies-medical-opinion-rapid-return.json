There were five minutes to go against Newcastle when Yarde slipped and two players fell on his left leg, dislocating and rupturing every ligament in his knee. \u201cA number of people did not believe I would play again,\u201d Yarde says. When the now 27-year-old was operated on, the surgeon told him his chances of playing again were only 50-50 and that it would be 12 to 18 months before he returned to training. Yet on Sunday Yarde starts for the Sharks in the European Champions Cup match against Exeter at the AJ Bell Stadium, his 10th match since defying medical opinion having returned to training nine months after the injury. \u201cIt was the toughest, most challenging period of my life and there were some dark times. Getting through it is my greatest achievement. A year ago I never thought I would be back training in the summer or playing again and the real driver for me was proving that I could cut it again at the top level.\u201d Yarde told Sale\u2019s website in the summer that there were times in the weeks after his three operations when he would break down and cry. It is the side of a sporting professional\u2019s life that followers do not see: success is apparent but the isolation and emptiness that follow a long-term injury, when the camaraderie of the training field and dressing room is exchanged for a long, lonely bout of rehab, can only be imagined. \u201cThere is no way you can prepare yourself for something like that and the first few months were really difficult,\u201d says Yarde, who during his rehabilitation worked with the Philadelphia-based knee specialist Bill Knowles. \u201cIt came down to toughness and mental determination and, rather than keep looking back, I am focusing on what is to come. I am really excited about this season and expect to get back to the level I was before to put myself in the shop window.\u201d Before his injury Yarde had set himself the goal of playing in the World Cup. It had been more than a year since he had played for England but that summer he had been named in the squad. \u201cI want to play for England again but I cannot look too far ahead because it is a huge challenge getting into the Sale team as one of four international wings in the squad,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point in trying to jump over too many hurdles too quickly and I know it will take time to get back to where I was, but I am determined to get there. \u201cWatching the World Cup was hard because I had set myself the target of being there. I became an England fan and watched every game, getting up every morning to make sure I was there for the start of a match and cheering in front of the television. \u201cI knew how hard the players had worked to get there and I thought they conducted themselves superbly on and off the field. They did not quite achieve their goal, but they were a credit to themselves and to English rugby.\u201d Yarde has kept in touch with Eddie Jones but knows past performances and sentiment will not get him back into the setup. \u201cI have spoken to him a few times,\u201d he says of the head coach, \u201cand he asks how things are going, but it is all about performance and consistency now. If you perform well, opportunities will follow. I want to be judged on what I am doing now.\u201d On Sunday Yarde faces a player who did make it to Japan, Exeter\u2019s Jack Nowell. Chris Ashton is on Sale\u2019s other wing and Denny Solomona is on the bench, while Scotland\u2019s Byron McGuigan is not in the 23. After a bonus-point defeat at Glasgow and victory over La Rochelle, Sale are in contention for what would be only their second appearance in the knockout stage in 10 attempts. \u201cConsistency is the key for us,\u201d Yarde says. \u201cWe have built such a competitive squad that it is a challenge to get into the team but now it is about winning games. We need to beat Exeter to keep our quarter-final dream alive. We know how difficult it will be because they have been at the top for a few years but, if we perform at the level we can, we can win. We will be up for it.\u201d For Yarde merely playing again is a victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
