Xenophon told the ABC on Thursday morning he was offering an olive branch to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, after the boilover in the Senate on Wednesday. \u201cI think there is some scope for some sensible compromises,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Senator Cormann was cranky yesterday but the olive branch is well and truly out.\u201d The independent teamed up with the Palmer United party rebel Jacqui Lambie, the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party senator Ricky Muir, the independent John Madigan, Labor and the Greens on Wednesday to disallow the government\u2019s future of financial advice regulations. The former Labor government introduced the Fofa package to increase protection for consumers obtaining advice from financial planners. After winning last year\u2019s election, the Abbott government moved to wind back some of Labor\u2019s changes. But Wednesday\u2019s successful disallowance means the system will revert to its previous form. Wednesday\u2019s events in the Senate also revealed the fracturing of the PUP voting bloc in the upper house. The government had gathered the numbers to pass its preferred Fofa regime this year courtesy of support from PUP and Muir. Lambie and Muir told the Senate on Wednesday they had made a mistake in supporting the deal because the changes were bad for consumers. Both senators signalled an intention to vote independently in future. Xenophon dismissed the government\u2019s arguments that Wednesday\u2019s developments would drive up the cost of financial advice, reduce competition and throw the sector into regulatory chaos. \u201cI accept that Mathias Cormann is using Orwellian language. It is simply ridiculous,\u201d the South Australian said on Thursday morning. But he said he hoped he could resume dialogue with Cormann and the government and other groups in the Senate after the finance minister had a \u201cBex and a lie down.\u201d Xenophon said he was prepared to sit down with the industry and consumer groups and the government and fellow senators to find common ground. Cormann, in a separate interview on the ABC, said the debate had been hijacked by \u201cvested commercial interests\u201d. The finance minister said the government\u2019s overhaul of Fofa had kept necessary consumer protection but eliminated unnecessary red tape. The minister \u2013 who launched an unsuccessful procedural filibuster on Wednesday in an effort to derail the disallowance \u2013 said agreement with the crossbench might still be possible. \u201cLet\u2019s see. We now have until 30 June to continue the conversation. Let\u2019s see where we end up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
