The speech will instead set out how the government plans to reduce entry to the UK from immigrants outside the EU, specifically by closing down family access. This will mean extending the probationary period for spouses looking to settle in Britain from two years to five. Cameron will pledge to raise the minimum salary \u2013 currently \u00a320,000 a year \u2013 that non-EU migrants must earn if they are to be allowed into Britain. He will also announce he is tackling forced marriages by criminalising the breach of forced marriage prevention orders. Cameron has pledged to cut immigration to \"tens of thousands\", but there is widespread scepticism that he will be able to achieve this target. Requiring firms to publish the number of immigrants on their payroll, an idea floated at the weekend, was designed to shame companies into taking on more indigenous labour. Industry opposed the proposal as a regulatory burden. Cameron will accept it is a human instinct to want to move to be with loved ones. The prime minister will say such immigrants coming should be able to speak English, adding that they must \"have the resources they need to live here and make a contribution here \u2013 not just scrape by, or worse, subsist on benefit\". Family migration accounted for almost a fifth of total non-EU immigration to the UK last year, he will point out. Nearly 50,000 visas were granted to family members of British citizens and those with permanent residence in the UK. He will say that of 500 family migration cases checked, more than 70% of UK-based sponsors had post-tax earnings of less than \u00a320,000 a year. He will add: \"When the income level of the sponsor is this low, there is an obvious risk that the migrants and their family will become a significant burden on the welfare system and the taxpayer.\" The prime minister said he will also look at whether \"a financial bond would be appropriate in some cases\". He will argue that sham marriages are rife since, \"time and again, visa officers receive applications from spouses or partners sponsoring another spouse or partner soon after being granted settlement in the UK\". He will say: \"There was a Pakistani national who applied for a spouse visa on the basis of his marriage to someone settled in the UK. He obtained indefinite leave to remain, and then immediately divorced his UK-based spouse. He returned to Pakistan and re-married and then applied for entry clearance for his new spouse. \"We simply can not sit back and allow the system to be abused in this way. So we will make migrants wait longer, to show they really are in a genuine relationship before they can get settlement.\" Immigrants will also be required to provide clearer evidence they are in a genuine relationship, and registrars will also be entitled not to officiate at ceremonies they regard as bogus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
