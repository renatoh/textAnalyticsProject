Based in France after 1945, their reputation grew steadily through the 1950s and 60s, founded upon their performances of the Beethoven and Bart\u00f3k quartets particularly. They recorded cycles of both composers twice, and this is the second of their Beethoven sets, originally made for Auvidis in the early 1970s. It appears to have been out of the CD catalogue for some while, so its reissue is very welcome, for these performances rank among the finest on disc. It's a progress through the 16 quartets that grows organically in understanding and depth as it goes on, moulded in a way that always seems perfectly natural, never self-conscious. Only the Quartetto Italiano, and, much more recently, the Tak\u00e1cs on Decca seem to match their combination of profundity and technical command; both those groups are a little more detached, more objective than the V\u00e9gh, whose emotional involvement seems just as intense as their musical concentration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
