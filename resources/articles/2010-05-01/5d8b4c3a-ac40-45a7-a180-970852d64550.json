A giant leap towards better schools. More help for communities, as we build the Big Society. Away with the surveillance state, ID cards and all the ugliness of the authoritarian Labour years. Hooray. But one is bound to wonder if Clegg's righthand man, Vince Cable, is really signed up to all this. \"Who's your hero?\" he was asked as part of the Evening Standard's My London feature the other day. \"As an economist, Keynes or Adam Smith. As a man of action and achievement, Deng Xiaoping, the former leader of the Communist party of China, who led China towards a market economy.\" That he did. But isn't he also credited with sending the tanks in to Tiananmen Square? Just as well Vince isn't home secretary. \u2022 Can't quite see him as culture secretary either, despite his acclaimed turn on Strictly Come Dancing. Just as well there's Jeremy Hunt \u2013 and his sidekick Ed Vaizey. It's the glamourous side of government but both were hardened in opposition and neither will worry about the inevitable bruises. \"My local MP Ed Vaizey in government? Excuse me while I chunder everywhere,\" tweeted one constituent, a comment picked up by the Stage newspaper. And who has been busiest passing the tweet around? Ed Vaizey. Respec'. \u2022 So it's all going to be better now. Liberty for all, rights of man and all that. But still Nick Clegg, the Tom Paine of our time, finds himself under fire. \"Clegg's claim that he proposes the biggest shake up of democracy in the UK since the 1832 Reform Act shows a weak grasp of British political history,\" insists the London Socialist Historians Group. \"While the 1832 Act was heralded as the 'Great Reform Act' for abolishing rotten electoral seats [or boroughs] and extending the franchise, in reality it simply gave political power to a small section of the new industrial class represented by the Whigs, the forerunner to the Liberal Democrats. Not only did 1832 not deliver much actual change, the Tories resisted so much that Britain came within a whisker of revolution before the act was passed,\" harrumphs group convenor Keith Flett. Just goes to show, the people are never happy. \u2022 And yet one must try, so there was President Obama, signing the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act, and strangely refusing to take any questions \u2013 an irony that seemed to have escaped him. The act honoured Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter killed by Islamic extremists in 2002, and there remains some confusion about his killer. Briton Ahmed Sheikh was found guilty of the murder in 2002, but Guant\u00e1namo inmate Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, in a closed military hearing in 2007, claimed to have beheaded Pearl. Jennifer Rubin writes in Commentary magazine: \"It is ironic and shameful that President Obama could not bring himself to identify the killers who beheaded the man who fearlessly reported on the jihadist terrorists.\" That's the thing with FoI. Once it starts, it never ends. \u2022 Furrowed brows and dry throats at Holyrood where security staff are doing their bit to be frugal but may now be a trifle overzealous. They have been refusing to share the complimentary fruit and refreshments with the public; insisting that these treats are reserved for MSPs. One visitor tells of being wracked by a drouth (that's extreme dry mouth apparently), and asking security staff for a glass of the bottled Strathspey water enticingly arranged on tables outside the meeting room. \"That's for committee room four sir. You're in committee room five, so you can't have any,\" came the reply. The visitor explained that notwithstanding the arrangements, he really was desperate for water. \"Use the toilet then,\" said the official. Hope you brought a glass. \u2022 Finally, is there nothing we won't do to sell newspapers? Giveaway supplements, free CDs. All welcome but, many would say, too much. Oh for a gentler time, when cutting edge promotional activity meant Spot the Ball; and oh for life in Teesdale, Co Durham where readers of the Mercury can play Spot the Sheep.
