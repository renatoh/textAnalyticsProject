In it he said: \"Greg says that, in pursuing an illegitimate complaint, [Alastair] Campbell behaved like 'a deranged, vindictive bastard', on the verge of losing a full set of marbles.\" The reference to marbles caught a reader's attention. \"What is the derivation of this phrase? Why should losing one's mind be associated with marbles?\" In this particular case, the reviewer offered what amounted to an explanation and qualification of its meaning: \"In my view, Campbell has many admirable qualities, but was undoubtedly going through a bad patch which made life for the rest of us (the prime minister, for example) almost impossible.\" The context is the angry turmoil attending the Gilligan affair. It is not a phrase that crops up in the Guardian very often and it is usually used with a non-serious or jocular intent. One of its fairly rare appearances - almost five years ago - was in a headline that read: \"Why losing one's marbles isn't all bad.\" The story was about the Elgin marbles. The reader's query nicely coincided with the arrival on my desk of a new book by Nigel Rees, A Word in Your Shell-like: 6,000 Curious and Everyday Phrases Explained (Collins, \u00a316.99) - a treasury of stimulating excursions and digressions in the English language. Rees actually explores but dismisses the association of the phrase with the Elgin marbles. \"At the popular level,\" he says, \"most people believe the phrase derives from a joke. When Lord Elgin brought back his famous marbles from the Parthenon and they ended up in the British Museum in 1816, the Greeks were hopping mad (and, indeed, remain so). But, with all due respect and however entertaining, this is not an origin to be taken seriously.\" According to Rees, \"almost everyone\" agrees that the expression is American in origin and he notes that the Oxford English Dictionary finds it first recorded in the journal American Speech in 1927. In fact, the OED (Supplement, 1976) provides the actual example from American Speech: \"There goes a man who doesn't have all his marbles.\" Rees explores the possible association of the phrase with the French meubles, \"furniture, movables\" (which the OED describes as a false translation), and asks, \"Could one imagine 'to lose one's marbles' coming from the idea of losing one's 'mind furniture'?\" He quotes in support two sayings that use furniture as an indicator of mental well-being or the lack of it. One is from a correspondent in Cheshire who notes there the expression, \"He's got all his chairs at home\"; and one from a correspondent in Yorkshire who wrote, \"If someone is a bit lacking in the head, we say that they haven't got all their furniture at home.\" Hence, Rees suggests, \"a home without furniture is empty, so 'lost one's marbles' = empty-headed, no longer at home, no longer 'there'.\" One of the examples that he calls in support actually seems to me to argue an altogether more direct and plausible origin. It comes from a publication of the English Dialect Society (West Cornwall Words) in 1880: \"Those that have marbles may play, but those that have none must look on.\" Rees says: \"Surely this admirably conveys the misfortune of those who are without the necessary wherewithal to participate in the game of life?\" So it does but, unless I am losing my marbles, it is simply making an illustrative reference to the game of marbles - (for a history see www.marblemuseum.org). The OED cites references to the game from English sources from around the beginning of the 18th century. The OED Supplement, by the way, equates the word with mental faculties, brains, or common sense. Although it doesn't make the direct connection between the game and the use of the word according to that definition, none of the examples it quotes seem incompatible with the idea. To give a couple of them: \"Do men who have got all their marbles go swimming in lakes with their clothes on?\" (PG Wodehouse's Cocktail Time, 1958); \"You lost your goddam' marbles? You gone completely crazy, you nutty slob?\" (John Wainwright's The Take-Over Men, 1969). Certainly not the sort of language we like to see in the Guardian. Forgive me for digressing, but as I found while browsing in Nigel Rees's book, one thing leads to another and it's a short step from the sublime to the ridiculous (Rees page 639). \u00b7 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 0845 451 9589 (UK only, calls charged at local rate) or +44 (0)20 7713 4736 between 11am and 5pm UK time Monday to Friday excluding UK bank holidays.
