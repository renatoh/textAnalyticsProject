I was on the wagon for nigh on a year, and then last month I saw my very own dealer, the main local trafficker of my favoured narcotic, in handcuffs on national television, and I fell right off the wagon. And no, the drug in question isn't heroin or GHB or crystal meth. It's much, much worse: television. I'd be better off on the Big Needle, I swear. And my dealer was John J Rigas, the 77-year-old founder-owner of Adelphia Cablevision, my local TV supplier, and the sixth-biggest cable outfit in the nation. Rigas was one of the first high-profile corporate heads arrested, handcuffed and made to do the ignominious \"perp walk\" for the cameras in the wake of the Enron flameout. He and his sons were charged in July with bilking their own company of $3.1bn. They were alleged to have made phony loans to themselves, bought luxury condominiums in Manhattan, Colorado and Mexico, and to have gone on fancy safaris. They were even accused of having planned their own $50m golf course in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, the small town where Rigas has been based since buying his first cable franchise there in 1952. And then, of course, the minute they got themselves nicked Adelphia cynically raised cable rates here in Los Angeles by 6%, prompting outrage from couch potatoes and vocal denunciations from Mayor James Hahn, a man famously hard to appal. The scale of the Rigas family's difficulties is breathtaking, involving some $2.1bn in loans said to have been guaranteed by the company, from whose board the Rigases resigned en masse back in May. By then it was too late, as Adelphia was already creaking under the debt mountain built up by Rigas's late-90s buying spree, the one that netted him a monopoly over half the LA cable market. James Comey, the US attorney for New York, a man I assume has glimpsed the full catalogue of human depravity, was deeply impressed: he called the Rigas case \"one of the largest and most egregious frauds ever perpetrated on investors and creditors\", while others accused the Rigases of using Adelphia \"as a personal piggy-bank\". The Rigases originally volunteered to surrender to authorities, but their offer was refused. The Feds wanted Lights, Camera, Public Disgrace, and they made sure that not one frame of Rigas's humiliation was missed. A beleaguered George Bush, seeking to put a million miles of daylight between himself and the kind of fraudsters who had lately made up a substantial portion of his donor-base, cheerfully announced Rigas's arrest, but he must have been deeply relieved Adelphia wasn't an oil company, or based in Texas. Things change in the Bush dynasty, apparently. Ten years ago I knew his father's bid for re-election was doomed when he threatened to veto a bill capping cable subscription rates, which even then were considered too high. The congressional majority was too large to veto, however, and Bush One learned there are few things more costly than messing with a feller's TV habit. The problem with American TV used to be that there were 100 stations and nothing worth watching. Nowadays there are 300 stations and if you're prepared to lower your quality-threshhold enough, as I, like my cable providers, invariably am, then there's always something to watch. And for 24 hours a day, too. You can find yourself on the couch at 4.30am, swearing you'll only watch one more hour of wall-eyed televangelism or professional bass-fishing, or just one last infomercial (a fascinating form of graveyard-shift sales-art that warrants extensive further scrutiny - and hearing me say that, you can immediately gauge the scale of my problem). Couchbound catatonia is, I hear, a sure sign of heroin addiction - and that goes double for TV junkies. I had to go cold turkey. I hadn't much liked what little I'd heard of John Rigas and Adelphia anyway. I knew our new cable honcho lived in a tiny rural hamlet back east, most of which he seemed to own, and was fond of proclaiming his attachment to the small-town virtues of modesty, plainspokenness and restraint in matters moral and monetary. In other words he believes all that hypocritical, 1954-vintage, porch-swing-and-white-picket-fence bullshit that Reagan used to hose America down with in his campaign speeches. Then I read that Rigas had removed all of Adelphia-LA's optional pay-per-view softcore porno channels, and I found myself most irate. Now, this isn't a service I'm ever going to miss, but there is something nauseating about a Bible- bashing fraud suspect wagging his backwoods, farmbelt finger at America's Sodom, a town that should be proud to be the living, twitching embodiment of Rigas's worst nightmares. The day Rigas did the perp walk I finally crumbled and called Adelphia. I had felt a throbbing need for telly for a month or so, mainly because I didn't plan to miss the fourth season of The Sopranos or that other likely mega-hit of the autumn line-up, The Invasion of Iraq (they're still ironing out a few pre-production gremlins on that one, I hear). And I had no choice in who I paid for TV, because cable franchises are usually monopolies that have only recently come under siege from the likes of TiVo, Direct TV and various up-and-coming satellite outfits. So I let it all flood back into my living room once more: a spigot dispensing disinfotainment, right wing news anchors, a deepening glut of reality-TV crap, myriad round-the-clock news channels that need ever-lower priorities if they're to keep their schedules packed, which in turn alters (or reverses) our understanding of what's important and what's not, and less familiar phenomena like the hot-tub-centric dating shows that proliferated while I was on the wagon. I knew my enemy well, and I still resubscribed. I asked for it and I got it. Serves me right. The great J Lee Anyone who remembers the BBC's old 1.40pm movie slot on Sunday afternoons in the 1970s will mourn the passing of director J Lee Thompson, since his was exactly the kind of familiar, lovable work that could always cheer you up on a rainy day. He was one of those indomitable British pros like Guy Hamilton or Ronald Neame: not an auteur by any stretch, but someone dependable whose name appeared on a lot of middling to rather good movies. Thompson's British films included such evergreen fare as Ice Cold in Alex, Northwest Frontier, Guns of Navarone, and Yield to the Night with Diana Dors. With the exception of the unpardonably boring Navarone, these are movies I loved when I was nine and will probably still love if I ever hit 90. Born in Bristol in 1914, Thompson was one of those film-makers who lived a little before getting into the movies. He first made his mark as a bantamweight boxer and a West End playwright before serving in the second world war as a B-29 tail-gunner - the kind of job that leaves rather more marks on a young man than three years at film school. He thrived in the war-obsessed, backward-looking film culture of the 1950s and moved to LA after the huge success of Navarone in 1961. Everything looked promising with his first US movie, the imperishable Cape Fear, with Gregory Peck and an animalistic Robert Mitchum. It's hard to believe Cape Fear and Navarone - the one so lithe and feral, the other so leaden and po-faced - were directed by the same man, but Thompson's generation of directors were only as good as the scripts they were handed, never better. Thompson made few other memorable movies in the States, and was trapped for too long on a treadmill of Planet of the Apes sequels and Charles Bronson vigilante pictures. No one is likely to hanker after The Greek Tycoon or The Passage when they're 90, but if he had only made Ice Cold in Alex, we'd still be forever in his debt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
