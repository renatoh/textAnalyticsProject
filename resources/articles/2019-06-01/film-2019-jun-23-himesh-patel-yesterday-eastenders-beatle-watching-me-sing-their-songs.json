At 16, he landed the role of Tamwar Masood on EastEnders, a part he played for nine years. He was social worker Nitin in Channel 4 comedy Damned and now takes the lead role of Jack in musical romcom Yesterday, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Danny Boyle, which imagines an alternative universe in which everyone except Jack has forgotten the Beatles ever existed. People are calling Yesterday your \u201cbreakthrough role\u201d. Does it feel that way? It does, although I\u2019m not sure what exactly I\u2019ve broken through! It\u2019s the sort of part I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get to play but I just happened to be right for the role. It wasn\u2019t written for someone of any specific ethnicity and we didn\u2019t shoehorn it in afterwards. We need those kind of advances too, as well as deliberate steps forward like Black Panther, which was very consciously the first black superhero movie. My character\u2019s background isn\u2019t even mentioned, it\u2019s just there as a statement of fact and that\u2019s powerful in itself. How did you come to be cast as struggling singer-songwriter Jack Malik? I was doing [stage play] People, Places &amp; Things in New York and got asked to do an audition tape for an \u201cuntitled Danny Boyle project with musical elements\u201d. They wanted me to do a monologue from a play and perform a Coldplay song on acoustic guitar. Back in London, I met Danny and Richard [Curtis], then got the script and was blown away by this comedic love story that was a celebration of the Beatles. After another audition, I got the part. It was a crazy couple of months. Was the Coldplay song because Jack\u2019s mentor, played by Ed Sheeran, was originally going to be Chris Martin? Yes, it was Chris Martin in the first draft. But really it was always destined to be Ed Sheeran because the story mirrors his journey in many ways. Ed was brilliant: down to earth, funny, totally willing to send himself up \u2013 and so relaxed on camera. Did you learn guitar for the part or could you already play? Vaguely. When I was 14, I bought myself a cheap electric guitar and tried to teach myself. When this film came along, it was a reason to apply myself properly. I sat down with Adem Ilhan, who\u2019s a great musician and composer, and we spent two months in a room, which we made to look like Jack\u2019s bedroom, just jamming and learning to play my own way. You play in front of some huge crowds in Yesterday. Did it give you a taste for rock stardom? For sure. It was so thrilling, I can see why it becomes addictive. Have Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr seen the film yet? We got their blessing \u2013 the project wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead without that \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s weird to think about a Beatle watching me sing their songs. Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar play your parents. As trailblazers of British Asian comedy, were they a big influence on you? Absolutely, all four stars of Goodness Gracious Me were. They were the main brown people on TV when I was growing up. When the trailer came out, Sanj emailed to congratulate me. I replied saying our generation are standing on their shoulders. They paved the way. Are more doors opening for Asian actors? I like to think so. Riz Ahmed was in The Sisters Brothers, a period gold rush movie, and Dev Patel\u2019s about to play David Copperfield. I\u2019ve just filmed two things set in the 1860s: a film called The Aeronauts and a TV adaptation of Eleanor Catton\u2019s The Luminaries. These kinds of role wouldn\u2019t have been open to people of our ethnicity a few years ago. So you\u2019re getting typecast as someone from the 1860s? [Laughs] That would be an amazing turn of events \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t get away from the period stuff!\u201d Was EastEnders a good training ground? Totally. Very grounding, too. You\u2019re not spoilt like you are on a film set. You drive yourself to work, pay for your own lunch and work hard: long days, scene after scene, last-minute line changes. Sometimes on a soap, it can become about all this other stuff \u2013 the party circuit, reality shows \u2013 but I gravitated towards people who kept it all about the work. Tamwar became a cult character, especially when he had a short-lived career in stand-up comedy\u2026 It\u2019s been 11 years and people still talk about that. It\u2019s really gratifying. Tamwar was a brilliantly dry, strange character. It always felt like he was outside the show, looking in. Viewers heard recently that Tamwar had got engaged off-screen\u2026 People were coming up and congratulating me. Tamwar was one of the good guys, so all I ever wanted was that whenever I left the show, he didn\u2019t die but went on to live a happy life. He\u2019s got Danny Dyer as a father-in-law now. That\u2019ll keep him in line. You wrote an essay for Nikesh Shukla\u2019s bestselling collection The Good Immigrant. How was that? I just wrote from the heart about my parents coming to this country and how my experience compared to theirs. It was the first time I\u2019d grappled with being stuck between two worlds, the way you dilute certain parts of your identity to fit in and what that does to you emotionally. I learned a lot about myself writing it. That book is a force for good and struck a chord with so many people. By the time it was published, the Brexit vote had happened, which only made it more meaningful. You\u2019re currently shooting Armando Iannucci\u2019s new HBO series, Avenue 5. What can you tell us about it? I\u2019m not sure how much I\u2019m allowed to say before they assassinate me. But it\u2019s a space comedy and the great Hugh Laurie\u2019s in it. As a Spurs fan, have you recovered from Champions League heartbreak? Just about. My dad got us tickets to watch it on big screens in the new Tottenham stadium. When Liverpool scored in the first minute, everyone just deflated. Yesterday is in cinemas from 28 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
