To his credit, he tried. Was he pleased with his (brilliant) opening goal in England\u2019s defeat of a game but callow Peru? \u201cWe worked very hard as a team and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Does he think he will start against Italy? \u201cRegardless of whatever team the manager picks, I\u2019m just here to work hard and show what I can do.\u201d How about that partnership with Wayne Rooney, then? \u201cIt\u2019s not just about me and Wazza, it\u2019s about everyone behind us from the goalkeeper right through the midfield.\u201d Sturridge, though, is a more interesting character than this, no matter how hard he might try. Asked, before shuffling off gratefully into the night, about England\u2019s expectations in Brazil, his answer was unexpectedly intriguing. He said: \u201cFor me, we\u2019ve just got to worry about how we play as a team, not worry about the opposition, not worry about anything other than what we can do. It\u2019s not about anybody else but us.\u201d Which is a very interesting point given that this is pretty much the opposite of what England have done for the past 64 years of tournament football. Just getting on with what they are best at and not worrying about the opposition was what Walter Winterbottom\u2019s team did at England\u2019s first ever World Cup in Brazil in 1950, a tournament that brought the catastrophic humiliation at the hands of the USA followed by a clinching 1-0 defeat by Spain for a team containing Stanley Matthews, Tom Finney and Jackie Milburn. It was Alf Ramsey, who also played in that team, who as manager successfully cast the template of a more cautious, more functional England, of athleticism over inspiration, the orthodoxy of discarding skittishly talented players for the more obviously biddable. This has been a familiar pattern for successive England tournament teams. Even now there is a suggestion that Sturridge himself may not start against Italy in Manaus, with Hodgson preferring to pack his midfield and play Wayne Rooney as a lone, muscular central striker. It would at least be a selection of England-hallmarked pragmatism. Despite producing a moment of high-class incision in England\u2019s last two matches, it could be argued Sturridge has given a Matthew Le Tissier-like performance on both occasions \u2013 a super-mobile Le Tissier; Le Tissier with a six-pack \u2013 contributing little for long periods but producing a razor\u2019s edge from nowhere when required. Hodgson would scarcely be an England manager worthy of the name if he did not fret about such things a little. Presented with a knockout-stage level of competition, the game-plan is familiar: minimise the chances the opposition gets to express itself rather than trusting in the more expansive talents in your own team. And for all the optimism over Hodgson\u2019s youthful and promising squad, this instinct was also there in his dress-rehearsal selection on Friday night. Raheem Sterling was the outstanding player at the sharp end of Liverpool\u2019s title run-in, more effective than Sturridge or Luis Su\u00e1rez and providing genuine fearless incision in those epic final few games. If Hodgson favours Danny Welbeck there are good reasons for this. Welbeck has done well for England in the past. He is disciplined and superbly athletic. But he is also the box-ticking pick, the triumph of seasoned competitiveness over simply putting on show the talent the system can produce, which is after all the basic point of international football. Similarly, there is inarguable sense in Jordan Henderson\u2019s selection alongside Steven Gerrard. Henderson runs for 90 minutes and is an underrated passer too. But the fact remains that for the better teams international football is a game of control and mastery of the ball and Henderson was made to look clumsy at times by a team of second-string Peruvians. Given that at pretty much every tournament since the 2002 World Cup the final act has been the same, with England passed into a state of rubbery-legged exhaustion by more skilled opponents, the answer at some time must be to pick players who can at least try to go toe to toe with that level of technical skill in handling the ball, passing and moving and saving their legs. Raw, muscular edges may work at Wembley in March against third-tier opposition but they look as ill-suited to Italy in Manaus as they were to Italy in the evening chill of Kiev two years ago. Jack Wilshere is the more technically competent footballer. But Henderson can run for his captain as well as himself and he is strong favourite to start in Brazil. It is a refrain so familiar as to be almost irrelevant. The idea that an England manager could simply pick something close to his most skilful XI \u2013 as more confident nations might \u2013 still looks like a piece of unforgivable naivety. And yet, for all that, a front four of Sterling, Sturridge, Adam Lallana and, of course, Rooney \u2013 for his finishing and occasional 360-degree passing when his game is up \u2013 would represent pragmatic good sense in many ways. International football is a game of skill, not of effort. Hodgson knows all this as well as anyone. He knows the better teams pass rather than run. Against this he also believes taking fewer risks means a par finish beyond the group stage is more likely on balance, even if another sweat-soaked knockout defeat will do little to capture the public imagination. The argument is easily made from the sidelines, but it is hard to see what England have to lose this time in trusting their more skilful players, trying to play as the better teams do, and for once at least dying with their passing boots on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
