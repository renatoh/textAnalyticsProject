Ben, Brooke, Advi and Charlie packed their school ties and made the 1,800-mile round trip from their primary school in Glasgow\u2019s East End to the grand halls of the United Nations human rights council. The 10-year-olds were in Geneva this week to chase up what the grownups were doing to tackle poverty in the UK. They had a date with Philip Alston \u2013 the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights who last November visited Avenue End school, which serves one of the poorest parts of Britain, as part of his investigation into the UK. Children there had told him about hunger and the shame of poverty, about not being able to afford trainers, TV or food and about foodbanks. Alston kept them in mind when he drafted his damning report, which he presented on Friday to hundreds of diplomats from around the world. He told them the UK was facing \u201ca national poverty crisis\u201d. But before he spoke the children had questions and ideas. \u201cWhy do you have the meetings when kids aren\u2019t here?\u201d asked Brooke, having noticed the hundreds of smartly dressed adults, but no children, milling around. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d said Alston, momentarily stumped. \u201cWe should have more kids coming here to tell us what they are thinking about. A lot of what governments do makes a lot of difference to your lives.\u201d Alston asked them what people could do to help child poverty. \u201cJust give them someone to talk to,\u201d said Ben. \u201cBe friends with them,\u201d added Advi. They had raised one of the aspects of child poverty missed this week in Geneva, but often felt keenly by children: loneliness. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you have come,\u201d said Alston. \u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d Alston then took them into one of the grand congress chambers where they posed for a photograph in the seats normally reserved for dignitaries. When Alston delivered his report he told a packed UNHRC his belief that economic and social insecurity in the UK was \u201crampant\u201d and that austerity had left the UK \u201ca more fractured and less compassionate society\u201d. He said: \u201cThe country that had pioneered the modern welfare state after world war two changed course dramatically,. Funding for welfare, for local government services, for children, for education, for youth, for legal aid, for the poor and for policing were slashed.\u201d Alston attacked the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for describing his assessment of UK poverty \u201cnonsense\u201d and cited a senior civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions who last week told parliament it was accurate. \u201cFourteen million people living in poverty, more than 1.5 million destitute, record levels of hunger and homelessness, falling life expectancy for some groups, one in three children across the country living in poverty,\u201d Alston said. \u201cThe greatest tragedy is the situation could be completely transformed in a short time.\u201d The UK government hit back, albeit in a written statement, attacking \u201cthe inflammatory language and overtly political tone of this report\u201d. We \u201cstrongly refute the claim that the design and delivery of welfare reforms, including universal credit, are deliberately punitive\u201d, it said. \u201cTackling poverty will always be a priority for this government.\u201d However, the government did not repeat its previous claim that his report was \u201cbarely believable\u201d and \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d. Instead, in a 66-point defence of its changes to welfare, council funding and privatisation, the government said record employment had overwhelmingly benefited the poorest UK households. It said austerity measures were necessary after the 2008 financial crisis and highlighted next year\u2019s planned end to the benefits freeze. It said it was fair to limit some benefits to two children and that the \u00a320,000 national benefit cap was supported by 73% of the UK public. The Avenue End children were already on their way back to Glasgow when the government\u2019s response came. But they were unlikely to have been impressed. Asked about ministers\u2019 previous dismissal of Alston\u2019s report, Ben promised they would \u201ckeep pushing\u201d. Brooke said: \u201cThey should listen. We will keep on \u2026 until they do something about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
