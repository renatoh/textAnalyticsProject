With matches against Aberdeen and Molde looming, Celtic progressed to the last four of the League Cup with success over a Hearts team who should rue their overcaution. The fact this was a forgettable match will matter little to Deila, who still has a domestic treble in his sights. Celtic\u2019s preparations suffered late disruption, their captain, Scott Brown, incurring an injury in the warm-up and having to be replaced by James Forrest. One of the visiting substitutes, Gary Mackay-Steven, was also hurt at the same point, forcing him to sit out proceedings entirely. Emilio Izaguirre, who required stitches after a training ground altercation with Nadir Ciftci on Tuesday, returned as Celtic\u2019s left-back. The opening period was tepid, a notable aspect in itself for a fixture which commonly lacks nothing in bite. Hearts\u2019 approach was clear; to allow Celtic to dominate possession before using the pace available on both flanks to attack where possible. The aim was to frustrate Deila and his players. Celtic duly enjoyed plenty of the ball but created little. A series of corners offered their finest opportunities, while Hearts\u2019 Osman Sow went close to breaking the deadlock at the opposite end. Celtic\u2019s finest spell of football came in the dying moments of the half but no one was on hand to convert an excellent low cross from Forrest. Hearts had the ball in the net shortly after the hour mark, only for Sow to be flagged offside. It was a warning the cup holders appeared to heed. Celtic\u2019s play had been enhanced by the arrival of Tom Rogic, who replaced Forrest. It was another midfielder, Stefan Johansen, who created the chance that sent Deila\u2019s team ahead. Johansen beat Morgaro Gomis to the ball before feeding Leigh Griffiths, who still had work to do; the striker bamboozled the Hearts back line before offering a fine, curling finish. Griffiths was involved as the lead was doubled. He hit the byline before providing a low cross, which Rogic flicked home. Hearts\u2019 response arrived too late, Arnaud Djoum finding the net with a header."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
