The portentous janitor of her apartment block (David Warner) then helps her use his lift as a time machine to revisit her past and put her messy life in order. After a mildly intriguing first 20 minutes, most viewers will want to take an hour-length jump into the future to put this idiotic film behind them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
