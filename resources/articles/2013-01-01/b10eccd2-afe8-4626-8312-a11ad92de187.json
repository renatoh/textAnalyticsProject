We proved it is possible to produce a well-designed school collaboratively with the senior teaching staff which adheres to a tight budget. Gove is making it unnecessarily difficult to design good schools.\" The Salford study must be set alongside the statement by Professor Dylan Wiliam, deputy director of the Institute of Education, in Building Design in April 2010 that \"architects don't understand schools\", and his recommendation of copying hotel chains, which rely on a small number of design templates. He wrote: \"It's wrong to be reinventing the wheel with every school. We are spending a huge amount of money allowing each school to articulate its identity.\" Mossbourne Academy is a fine building, but it cost \u00a33,000/sq m to build, compared with the Learning and Skills Council's benchmark of \u00a31,500/sq m for what it called \"world-class buildings\", and a prefab supplier's offer of \u00a3600/sq m. In February, its former head, Michael Wilshaw, wrote in the Guardian: \"Mossbourne Academy \u2026 now achieves results much better than the national average and sends pupils to Oxbridge, not because of a bright new building, but because of good systems and structures, good teaching, and staff who work hard and make no excuses for failure.\" Even if fancy one-off buildings did improve pupil performance, which seems doubtful, Rogers should get real: we haven't the money for \u00a33,000/sq m schools.
