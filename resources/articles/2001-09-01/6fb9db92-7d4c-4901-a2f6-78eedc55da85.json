Operation Saif Sareea (Swift Sword) 2, planned months ago, is due to start next week. It is the largest military exercise since the cold war, involving 24,000 British troops - nearly a quarter of the British army - and a Royal Navy taskforce led by the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. It includes two nuclear-powered submarines, one of which, HMS Trafalgar, is equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Illustrious has 15 Harrier jets on board. The taskforce also includes the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, with a Royal Marine Commando brigade on board. A defence source said yesterday that under present plans the exercise was going ahead. However, he said it was being kept under review. He added: \"We are watching events very closely.\" The exercise has been described by Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, as showing \"Britain's ability to deploy rapidly a considerable force with real punch over strategic distances\". Oman is keen for the exercise to go ahead as planned. British officials suggested yesterday that if the US requested the use of part of the taskforce, the government would have little option but to accede. Oman, in a key strategic position at the mouth of the Gulf, is a close ally of Britain's. The sultan was put into power with the help of MI6 and British special forces in 1970. The exercise, which would also involve thousands of Omani troops, is due to finish at the end of October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
