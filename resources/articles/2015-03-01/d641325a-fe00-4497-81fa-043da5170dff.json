A Second Chance has a premise and final twist that somehow manage to be ingenious and yet slightly crass at the same time. But it\u2019s all acted with absolute conviction, like a feature-length episode of Roald Dahl\u2019s Tales of the Unexpected. Perhaps only Bier and her severe-looking repertory cast could get away with it. Andreas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is the clean-cut young cop with excellent career prospects and a perfect life; he has a lovely home, a beautiful wife Anna (Maria Bonnevie), and he\u2019s devoted to his new baby. He and his boozy, depressive partner Simon (Ulrich Thomsen) are disgusted when they are called to a violent domestic dispute in a squalid flat and the culprit is a notorious drug addict, they know all too well: Tristan (Nikolaj Lie Haas), who is probably abusing his baby. Tristan\u2019s life is a queasy inverse of Andreas\u2019s, and their fates are to collide. There are some unwatchably, all-but-unforgivably grim scenes, but Bier carries them off, just about. It\u2019s ripe for a Hollywood remake, probably starring Ryan Reynolds as the straight-arrow cop, Josh Hutcherson as his mate and John Hawkes as the druggie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
