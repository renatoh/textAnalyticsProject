Rattus detentus, an ancient, isolated and previously unknown species of the genus Rattus \u2013 a rat \u2013 has been so named for the Latin \u201cdetained\u201d, \u201cin reference to the isolation of ... Manus Island and to the recent use of the island to detain people seeking political and/or economic asylum in Australia\u201d. The animal has been described for the first time, in the Journal of Mammalogy, by an international team of scientists including a former Australian of the Year, the mammalogist and palaeontologist Prof Tim Flannery. Detentus is known to live only on Manus Island, and only in two areas. It is an \u201cisland giant\u201d, according to Flannery, larger than almost any rat across the Melanesian archipelago. A typical detentus weighs nearly half a kilogram, with short, very coarse fur and a short tail. Over millennia of isolation on Manus, detentus has adapted to conditions. It has powerful front incisors but small molars, suggesting it uses its front teeth to break open hard nuts. Detentus is, according to Flannery, an early branch of the Rattus genus found across the Melanesian archipelago. Before confirmation detentus existed, Flannery said scientists had suspected there was a large rat endemic to the island. He said it had been exciting and \u201can immense privilege\u201d to be able to discover and name the new species. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for this rat for 30 years,\u201d he said. Labelling the detentus a new species was based on three specimens collected on Manus Island in the Admiralty group of islands, Papua New Guinea, between 2002 and 2012. The specimens were compared with subfossil specimens from the Pamwak archaeological site on Manus, which \u201cconfirm the species as a long-term resident of Manus Island\u201d. The decision to name the new species detentus, the scientists wrote in their paper, was made \u201cin reference to the isolation of this Melanesian Rattus lineage on Manus Island and to the recent use of the island to detain people seeking political and/or economic asylum in Australia\u201d. Flannery suggested the name to his colleagues, who immediately agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often as a scientist that you get to make a statement like this, but I wanted to express my sympathy and my solidarity for the people held in the detention centre on Manus,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to say to them, in this small way, \u2018You are not forgotten.\u2019\u201d Sightings of detentus are rare; it is possibly seriously endangered. Residents report it has previously been seen across Manus and sometimes on adjacent Los Negros Island (the two islands are connected by a bridge) but efforts by zoologists to find further evidence of it have been fruitless. \u201cThat really rang alarm bells for us, that it couldn\u2019t be found by people who are expert in this field,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cPerhaps in times past it was common, but it\u2019s rare now.\u201d Detentus might be threatened by its forest habitat being converted to farmed land, feral cats, or by the spread of introduced rat species, which might carry disease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
