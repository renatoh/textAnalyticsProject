Shepherd, 31, who was jailed for six years after Charlotte Brown, 24, died on their first date when she was thrown from his boat as it capsized, is challenging his conviction for manslaughter by gross negligence. The web developer went on the run, eventually fleeing to Georgia, ahead of his trial, where he was convicted at the Old Bailey in his absence in July last year over the incident in December 2015. At a hearing on Thursday at the Royal Courts of Justice, Shepherd\u2019s lawyers said he was initially interviewed as a \u201csignificant witness\u201d rather than a suspect, meaning he was not afforded his rights to be cautioned and to have a solicitor present. Shepherd\u2019s barrister, Stephen Vullo QC, said the court would have to decide whether the interview caused \u201cunfairness\u201d and therefore should not have been allowed in evidence at his trial. Driving a boat under the influence of alcohol on the Thames in central London and speeding are both offences under bylaws of the Port of London Authority, Vullo told the court. Police knew in advance that both Shepherd and Brown had been drinking alcohol, the barrister said, and therefore he should have been cautioned. \u201cThe only reason why he was not cautioned and given his rights to a solicitor on the day of the significant witness interview was due to a mistake by the police,\u201d Vullo said. \u201cWhat had happened is the investigation team had contacted the maritime police to ask whether offences had been committed \u2026 They were told no offences had been committed \u2013 including speeding and driving the boat with excess alcohol. \u201cThere were clearly grounds to suspect Mr Shepherd of committing at least two bylaw offences.\u201d Not only was Shepherd not cautioned or offered a solicitor, the barrister said, but he was \u201cpositively told\u201d he was only going to be treated as a witness. Vullo said the interview \u201chad the shape, the form and feel of an interrogation\u201d and Shepherd was asked questions about offences. Lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) argued there was \u201cno requirement\u201d to have cautioned Shepherd before his police interview. Aftab Jafferjee QC said the safety of Shepherd\u2019s manslaughter conviction was \u201cnot in any sense imperilled\u201d. He told the court: \u201cThe interview was to establish the clear facts of the incident and he was the only individual who could say what happened.\u201d He later added: \u201cHe was never being questioned about an offence.\u201d Shepherd, appearing in court via video link from HMP Woodhill, where he is serving his sentence, confirmed his name at the start of the case. His appeal against the manslaughter conviction is being heard by Sir Brian Leveson and two other judges. Shepherd, originally from Exeter, handed himself in to authorities in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, in January before being later extradited to the UK. At Shepherd\u2019s trial, jurors heard he and Brown, from Essex, had been drinking champagne and headed out on a late-night ride in his speedboat past the Houses of Parliament. The court was told Shepherd handed the controls to Brown just before the vessel overturned, tipping them both into the cold water. Shepherd was pulled alive from the river but Brown was found unresponsive and unconscious. After his return from Georgia, Shepherd was sentenced in April to an additional six months for breaching bail. Last week, he was jailed for a further four years in a separate case at Exeter crown court after he admitted wounding with intent in relation to an attack on a barman. Shepherd struck David Beech, a former soldier, with a vodka bottle in March 2018 after being asked to leave The White Hart hotel in Newton Abbot, Devon, the court heard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
