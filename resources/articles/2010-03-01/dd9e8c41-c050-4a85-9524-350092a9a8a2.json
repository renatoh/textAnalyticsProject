K\u00e1tya Kabanov\u00e1 has all the Alden trademarks, with a stern avoidance of anything too naturalistic in Charles Edwards's sets and Jon Morrell's costumes \u2013 just enough to suggest that the action has been updated from the period of the Ostrovsky play on which it's based to the time when Jan\u00e1cek composed the opera, around 1920. By translating a Russian tragedy into a Soviet one, though, Alden isn't making an obvious political point, except perhaps to suggest that Katy\u00e1's family, with its unbending matriarch, is a microcosm of the dysfunctional society that spawned it. Patricia Racette's K\u00e1tya and Stuart Skelton's Boris teeter along the edge of the stage, as if on the brink of toppling to disaster, and the physical distance between them seems to mirror their psychological separateness. Yet, despite Alden's tight dramatic focus he cannot compensate for what is lacking dramatically in the original. K\u00e1tya may be Jan\u00e1cek's most popular opera, but arguably it is also his most conventional and trite, and needs larger-than-life performances to provide its beating heart. Everything about this performance is first rate \u2013 from Mark Wigglesworth's beautifully detailed and expansive conducting, through Alfie Boe's Kudriash, Anna Grevelius's Varvara and Clive Bayley's Dikoy to the leading roles, with Racette and Skelton counterpointed with Susan Bickley's Kabanicha, as monstrous of character as of coiffeur. But it is never moving. With the exception of John Graham-Hall's Tikhon, K\u00e1tya's helpless husband, no one makes us care about their predicament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
