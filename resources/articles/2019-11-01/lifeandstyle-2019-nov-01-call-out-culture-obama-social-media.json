You\u2019ve been called out: your mistake suddenly feels grave and irreparable; you may even worry that this one episode could affect your whole life. A version of call-out culture has been functioning for centuries as a tool for the marginalized and their allies to reveal injustice and the need for reform. The practise of directly addressing inequality underpins countless social justice movements, from civil rights to Standing Rock. The contemporary idea of a \u201ccall-out\u201d, however, generally refers to interpersonal confrontations occurring between individuals on social media. In theory, call-outs should be very simple \u2013 someone does something wrong, people tell them, and they avoid doing it again in the future. Yet you only need to spend a short amount of time on the internet to know that call-out culture is in fact extremely divisive. Former president Obama pointed out this week at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago that call-outs can give the illusion that you\u2019re effecting change, even if that is not true. \u201cIf I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong word or verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, because, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was. I called you out.\u2019 That\u2019s not activism,\u201d Obama said. A reason call-outs can be polarizing is they often challenge the status quo. They can spark discomfort and offense, as when Canadian activist Nora Loreto went on Twitter to suggest that the C$15.2m raised to support the Humboldt Broncos junior ice hockey team after a deadly bus crash last year was donated so generously in part because victims of the accident were young, male and white. Or earlier this month when, in response to Ellen DeGeneres tweeting about her friendship with George W Bush and kumbaya policy of being nice to everyone, critics pointed out that niceness is not an unalloyed good. Some people feel that call-outs are an excuse for petty drama \u2013 a way to stir up gossip more than to promote social justice. Think of when Coleen Rooney launched a real-life soap opera by accusing fellow British football wife Rebekah Vardy of subterfuge last month, or the heady influencer drama that escalated between YouTubers Tati Westbrook and James Charles this summer. Yet the most potent critiques of call-out culture come from those who feel it is an excuse for crude vigilante justice \u2013 \u201czealotry \u2026 fueled by people working out their psychological wounds\u201d, as the New York Times columnist David Brooks called it earlier this year. A \u201ctrial by fire\u201d method of responding to any alleged violation of propriety, writes the Atlantic\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf. A frequently cited problem with call-outs is that it\u2019s all too easy to get carried away and overpunish people, turning alleged perpetrators of upsetting acts into victims themselves. \u201cWhat can often start out as well-intentioned and necessary criticism far too quickly devolves into brutish displays of virtual tar-and-feathering,\u201d writes the activist and writer Ruby Hamad. This leaves one question: how can we benefit from the social good call-out culture can help achieve, without succumbing to the toxicity and futility that has come to be associated with it? Some advocate a softer approach to call-outs. By ganging up on an individual, \u201cyou\u2019re taking this moral high ground, with a lot of righteous indignation, and inviting others to participate in a public shaming exercise\u201d, which is rarely productive, says Anna Richards, a therapist specializing in conflict mediation. Richards cautions against taking a \u201creductionist approach\u201d when calling out an individual. When we rationalize our own mistakes, \u201cwe tend to give ourselves really high context\u201d, she says. \u201cWe think, well I was going through something, and there were certain norms at the time, I was following everybody else,\u201d but when someone offends us we\u2019re less willing to see what contributed to their behavior, aside from inherent badness. While there is no one absolute right way to call someone out, Richards believes that learning to analyze our own motivations when offering criticism, and considering the context and possible consequences of the situation we\u2019re contributing to helps call-out culture work productively. Of course, it\u2019s also up to the individual whose behavior has been called into question to be open, humble and willing to see such incidents as opportunities to learn, rather than a one-way ticket into a cartoon dust ball fight. After all, one tried and true way to begin resolving interpersonal conflict is to sincerely apologize when you have, intentionally or not, caused harm. Unfortunately, apologizing can be challenging for some. According to Richards, in order for someone to apologize they need to have a fairly robust sense of self-worth, and often people are insecure and pathologically afraid of being wrong. \u201cPeople feel as though they\u2019re already on shaky ground and if they have some sort of mistake highlighted it would be drawing from an empty cup,\u201d she says. \u201cGenerally what I see is just a total collapse, where the person\u2019s sense of self is eroded, or a kind of counter-attack, where they double down on their position and don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d In other cases, a self-preservation instinct will lead people to offer a submission\u2014a calculated, face-saving apology that doesn\u2019t suggest true accountability. (Such as, most believe, those offered by actor Gina Rodriguez earlier this month, and comedian Shane Gillis this summer, both for using offensive racial epithets.) Richards may believe in an empathetic approach to conflict resolution, yet she is wary of putting the onus of peacekeeping and politesse on the injured party. Rather, she suggests anger may be better channeled at the root of the systemic forces that give individuals the entitlement to behave in a way that\u2019s uncaring of others. What that means is that there are circumstances when it may be better to confront not individuals, but political or corporate institutions able to implement change or influence others on a larger scale. After all, Richards mediates conflict all day long, and she says that an individual changing their behavior is \u201cnot as common as we would like\u201d. As the old saying goes: choose your battles wisely. Still, positive outcomes are possible. According to writer and activist Kitty Stryker, the recent backlash to the Netflix animated series Big Mouth\u2019s inaccurate definition of bisexuality is an example of functional call-out culture. Members of the queer community voiced their anger when the show misrepresented bisexuals as not being attracted to trans individuals. Producer Andrew Goldberg responded with an apology and pledge to do better in the future. Could Goldberg have done more? Sure, his critics have suggested he hire a more diverse writing room, for one, and it remains to be seen how he\u2019ll make his work more inclusive. Yet atonement is a process; the only way to begin it is by acknowledging a mistake and expressing the sincere intent to learn from it. \u201cI think what differentiates a call-out from bullying is that it shouldn\u2019t be about punishing someone for something they have done, rather it should be about establishing a new pattern of behavior,\u201d says Stryker, who has been on both the giving and receiving ends of call-outs throughout her career. \u201cBasically, when someone calls you out they want you to start showing through your actions that you care about the issue you\u2019ve been called out on.\u201d If you\u2019re confronted about something offensive you may have said or done, Stryker acknowledges making an effort to listen and learn may be difficult. \u201cYou are going to get petty at times, you\u2019re going to get mad, you\u2019re going to be like, \u2018why should I listen to this person?\u2019 But you have to take a deep breath and not tweet when you\u2019re in that state, and be like \u2018OK, they are very mad at me, but what is the fundamental seed in here that I can take away?\u2019 \u201cWhen I get called out, I think, \u2018awesome this is a chance for me to learn,\u2019\u201d says Stryker. \u201cI don\u2019t need forgiveness on top of that. I just don\u2019t want to hurt my friends.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
