Dance 3 is a new initiative by the National Dance Network that aims to address the issue. Twenty-nine venues across the country are showing a series of triple bills, drawing on a pool of nine pieces by different choreographers. The programme at the Linbury Studio theatre opened with Cabin Fever \u2013 a short solo by Tom Dale. Dancer Stephen Moynihan appears as a hunched, haunted creature. He is slippery, indirect: his head worms away from his shoulders, he rolls and unfolds like a woodlouse. A portrait with pathos rather than a fully developed piece, Cabin Fever is nevertheless riveting to watch, even if the lighting design feels like an afterthought. In Ben Wright's Passing Strange and Wonderful, Keir Patrick plants a brief kiss on Lise Manavit. The choreography seems to unpack the mixed meanings behind that gesture. The hushed, always intimate duet slides seamlessly between registers: blind nuzzling, jostling for space, solitary sighs, smotherings and separations. It's an introspective but slowly spellbinding piece. The silence is intense, and Guy Hoare's lighting \u2013 shafts and shadows that illuminate, shroud or cut across the dancers \u2013 is as suggestive as the dance itself. Hoare also lights Claire Cunningham and Jos\u00e9 Agudo's 4M2, but this duet remains resolutely obscure. There are some strong signals: a voiceover about birds on a cliff, screen projections of pylons and wheatfields. What they point to is anyone's guess. 4M2 reinforces the stereotype of contemporary dance as bafflingly cryptic, if not outright opaque. Nice dancers, though."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
