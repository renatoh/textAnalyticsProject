The intruders smashed through a door at the offices in the Jordanian embassy, which has represented Baghdad, until two months ago, since it broke off diplomatic relations with the UK in 1991. Glass in the front door was shattered, and a torn portrait of the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, could be seen inside. \"We are all just normal Iraqis, happy for the Iraqi people who were liberated today,\" said Ali Baraka, 23, a student from London who managed to avoid arrest. He added that the break-in had been a spontaneous action. \"Around 20 people went inside the embassy. All they wanted to do was to give a peaceful expression of their happiness of the fall of the regime today,\" Mr Baraka said. Zuhair al-Maher, who said that he belonged to a group called Iraqi Opposition in Exile, said around 60 people had taken over the building and \"evicted a couple of staff.\" \"We have occupied it to show the world that the Iraqi opposition is delighted and glad at the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime,\" he said. Police said they arrived at the office shortly after 3.30pm. \"Twenty-four people were arrested for criminal damage and associated offences,\" a spokesman said. \"They were taken to a central London police station.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
