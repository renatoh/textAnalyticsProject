Nine months later, the contracting group\u2019s share price has crashed from 900p to 108p. Kier\u2019s borrowings are much higher than imagined at the time, despite the arrival of \u00a3250m in cash from a badly-received rights issue at 409p last December. Andrew Davies, the new chief executive, is now ditching smaller business units to try to get borrowings under control and restore the faith of trade insurers. And, naturally, the dividend is a goner. There won\u2019t be one this year or next. As far as it goes, Davies\u2019 rescue strategy looks sensible. The group will sell or \u201csubstantially exit\u201d divisions that include the housebuilding unit Kier Living and the commercial property operation. Both have contributed to the wild swings in Kier\u2019s debt levels, and so score badly in the hunt for much-needed stability. In theory \u201ccore\u201d Kier should be more predictable. It will be concentrated on regional building work plus contracts at big infrastructure projects such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, the HS2 railway and Crossrail. For good measure, the new boss is cutting 1,200 jobs. It\u2019s a plan. It was also essential that Davies move quickly. He\u2019s been in post for only eight weeks and had hoped to take another month strategically reviewing the mess. There was no time to wait, however, once trade insurers started to question the strength of Kier\u2019s balance sheet. Half the challenge here is to restore confidence. Best to get on with some execution. Indeed, this debt-reduction effort could have been adopted two or three years ago, and it surely became essential after Carillion\u2019s failure shocked lenders and suppliers in the world of contracting 18 months ago. That earthquake was either missed or ignored by Kier\u2019s board when it was pondering their dividend declaration last year. Philip Cox was the chairman then, and still is. By rights, he should join the ranks of those Kier employees who will lose their jobs. Do not weep for Babcock It would not be a surprise if Babcock\u2019s investors were depressed. Shares in the Ministry of Defence contractor have been falling since the purchase of the helicopter firm Avincis in 2014. Brexit hasn\u2019t helped. Nor has the MoD\u2019s lack of cash. Nor has a hostile online campaign by a mystery \u201cresearch\u201d outfit. But sufficiently depressed to contemplate an all-share merger with the outsourcer Serco? Surely not. Babcock\u2019s board itself dismissed the approach \u2013 made in January, but confirmed only now \u2013 as having no strategic merit, a judgment that feels correct. The supposed synergies in defence were loose. Babcock, which refits nuclear submarines and owns the Devonport and Rosyth shipyards, is far higher up the engineering ladder. The point is illustrated by the two sides\u2019 profit margins. Serco achieves 3% while Babcock, for all its troubles, still gets 11%. One can\u2019t blame Serco\u2019s chief, Rupert Soames, for trying to be opportunistic. He has been widely applauded for his efforts to fix the company and it would not be a surprise if he were in search of a bigger stage to try to get his share price to motor. But Babcock shareholders do not need to shed tears over what might have been. Self-help, assuming it actually happens under the incoming chair Ruth Cairnie, must be a better long-term approach. Deutsche, now a market cap minnow As Deutsche Bank contemplates creating a \u20ac50bn (\u00a345bn) \u201cbad bank\u201d as a way to stop losing so much money in investment banking, let\u2019s remind ourselves of the market capitalisation of Germany\u2019s financial champion. It\u2019s a mere \u20ac13bn, which, in global banking terms, doesn\u2019t even qualify for second division status. Let\u2019s also recall what used to be said about German banks. David Marsh, a guru on German financial matters and chairman at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum thinktank, wrote recently that the former chancellor Helmut Schmidt \u201cused to lament how Germany\u2019s giant banking groups would stoke up dangerous enmity among neighbouring countries by inevitably dominating European finance\u201d. As Marsh said, those past fears \u201cnow look near-comical\u201d. Indeed, if the politics would allow it, Deutsche could be seen as a takeover target for a larger European rival. Even Barclays\u2019 adventures in investment banking look conservative by comparison with Deutsche\u2019s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
