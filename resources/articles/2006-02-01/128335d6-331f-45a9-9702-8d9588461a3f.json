But on March 29, a total solar eclipse will sweep across Africa, and tourism ministers from Ghana to Egypt are hoping it will tempt travellers to visit some of the least explored and most rewarding parts of the continent. The eclipse will push in from the Atlantic, making landfall on the west African coast at Ghana, pitching fishing villages and beach resorts along the county's coastline into temporary night. From there, the shadow of the moon will move swiftly east and north, tracking across Togo and Benin into north-west Nigeria, then across Niger and Libya before skimming the north-west corner of Egypt, on its way to the Mediterranean and Turkey. The most accessible eclipse destination for independent travellers is probably Ghana. As the coastline will host the main event, you can settle down for a beachside seat on March 29. For all its charms, Ghana has remained impervious to tourism. Have no fear of running into winter-sun package holiday hordes; a pleasingly deserted beach will not be hard to find. Of course, this also means the country lacks the tourist infrastructure of Kenya or South Africa. Ghana is a \"developing country\" in the most visible sense possible: miles upon miles of residential homes under construction, tower blocks under construction, and piles of rubble and breezeblock factories lining the main coastal road, which is also under construction. Expect dusty, bumpy diversions. The low-rise, laid-back, traffic-choked capital of Accra has an abundance of good restaurants, well-stocked shops and comfortable hotels. Somehow, though, the city fails as a tourist destination. It might be the garbage, or the open sewers, or the general lack of cultural highlights. But the best of Ghana lies outside the capital in any direction. The beach town of Anomabo, about 2.5 hours west of Accra, is a budget-friendly tropical paradise for tourists. Anomabo itself divides cleanly into two realities: a beach resort featuring soft white sand, coconut palms and lobster dinners; and a struggling fishing village featuring some of the most interesting shrines in Ghana. The friendly, comfortable Anomabo Beach Resort lies on a pristine stretch of coast with nothing but the occasional fishing boat blocking the view of the horizon. The brightly painted wooden sunbeds are the perfect spot for relaxing with a pair of solar safety glasses and enjoying the eclipse, which will pass over at 9.10am, lasting just over three minutes at Anomabo. The resort has bodyboards and windsurfing equipment on hand for guests, but seek advice before jumping into the waves. Strong currents and treacherous undertows make swimming off any part of the Ghanaian coast potentially treacherous, so ask the resort staff where you can swim safely. Lifeguards are on duty during daylight hours. After the eclipse, make your way to the neighbouring village, home to seven clever, colourful Posuban shrines, sculpted concrete structures depicting animals, weapons, people and, sometimes, complex representations of traditional sayings. The Posubans are unique to Fante villages in the central coastal region, and were built by Asafo companies, originally local military groups. Benjamin, a security guard at the beach resort, has agreed to show me around the shrines when his shift ends. He directs our car through narrow and deeply rutted roads lined with goats, chickens and swirling black plastic bags. Near the beach we find a large concrete ship, complete with coloured glass windows, rising above the surrounding poverty with great dignity. Benjamin despairs at the lack of tourist trade in Anomabo, despite its cultural significance. \"If the roads were better, they would get visitors,\" he sighs. A quick daytrip away from Anomabo is Elmina, which bills itself as the largest and oldest European structure connected with the slave trade in sub-Saharan Africa. From a distance, Elmina Castle looks picturesque, whitewashed and majestic above the town's busy fishing harbour. But as you walk up to the forbidding drawbridge, and traverse two moats into the barren interior, the horror seeps in. Sixteen European forts - held variously by the Portuguese, Dutch and British - remain on the coast of Ghana. Elmina is by far the most godforsaken of the lot. Augusta, our thoroughly modern tour guide, lays it out for us: of the slaves who were transitted through Elmina Castle, only a third survived the ordeal. She points out the narrow wooden stairs where women were dragged from the stinking, airless dungeons and up to the governor's quarters to be raped. Those who died were carried back down the stairs and flung into the Atlantic. Augusta pauses for a long while in the church the Dutch colonisers, built directly above the dungeons. \"Here they would worship God, while below the Africans died. They said that God stayed only in this room, and did not have anything to do with the rest of the fort,\" she says, still unable to believe it herself, even after explaining the slave traders' logic to countless visitors. From Elmina you can see the British fort at Cape Coast, which houses a very good museum exploring the slave trade. Cape Coast is worth a visit in its own right - friendly and welcoming, it is a good place to wander around the shops and see what Ghana has to offer. You can spend big money on little people at Global Mamas, a cooperative shop that makes adorable children's clothing from locally produced batik fabrics. Proceeds support projects that aid women and children in Ghana. The shop also arranges classes in batik sewing and Ghanaian cooking. The attached Cape Caf\u00e9 serves pizzas, stews, fried rice and local dishes for between \u00a31 and \u00a32 a plate. About half an hour inland from Cape Coast, you can explore the rainforest at Kakum National Park. The highlight is a series of seven rope bridges suspended 30 metres above the forest floor. From here you can take in the view across the forest, and if you arrive in the early morning or late evening, you may see monkeys. This experience is not for those who suffer from vertigo. My toddler ran fearlessly through the canopy walk, stopping only to giggle at the butterflies and bird calls. But a friend clung on so tightly she had rope burns down her arms. The point of the greatest eclipse actually lies in Libya, near the border with Chad. If you can find a way to get there, good luck to you. Personally, I'll be kicked back on that sunlounger on the Ghanaian beach, sipping juice from a freshly cut coconut. But I'm lazy that way.
