Nani is still incensed by the studs-up kick from Carragher that split open his left leg during Liverpool's 3-1 defeat of United two Sundays ago, leaving a wound that needed five stitches and left him in tears on the Anfield pitch. Carragher tried to apologise to the Portuguese winger after the match but was refused entry to the United dressing room and Nani explained why he had snubbed a player he believes deliberately set out to hurt him. \"If you ask anyone in football, anyone who has suffered a tackle like that, they are not going to accept an apology, especially as it was the second year running he took me out,\" Nani said. \"He came to apologise after the game but I was not happy. It is the second time he has injured me. He always tackles like that. Before, he put me out of the game for two months.\" By that, Nani was referring to an injury he sustained in a match at Anfield in October 2009. He needed treatment to play in subsequent games but the injury eventually forced him out for five weeks from early December to mid-January and he holds Carragher responsible. Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has described Carragher's latest challenge as \"disgraceful\" and Nani remains outraged that the perpetrator received only a yellow card from the referee Phil Dowd. \"I don't know what Carragher was thinking but I do know what he did was not football,\" he said. \"I don't want protection. I just want the referees to be fair. If it is a red card, they have to give it. If they give the card, the next time the player doesn't make the tackle.\" The wound went right through to Nani's shin and he considers himself \"lucky to be still playing this season\" after fearing he was facing a lengthy spell out of the team. \"The first time I looked at my leg, I was thinking: 'The season is finished for me now.' That's why I was crying. I felt the pain straight away. But I was in shock. I wanted to show the ref [what he had done] so I got to my feet. I knew I wasn't going to play any more and, if I was not going to be able to play, he has to give the red card. But then he quickly gave the yellow card. How could he give the yellow card? He hadn't seen my leg. Then I showed him my leg and you could tell on his face [that he thought he should have given a red].\" Nani was asked whether it was wrong that, because the referee had witnessed the foul, the FA did not have the authority to take further action based on video evidence. \"Yes, I think so. The referee told me after he saw my leg. It could have ended my season. The referee can decide afterwards to say something [to the FA].\" The injury meant Nani missing the FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal last weekend before returning, ahead of schedule, for the Champions League tie against Marseille on Tuesday. \"The doctor who saw my leg said I had been lucky because it just needed stitches and I would be out for two or three weeks. He's surprised that I have recovered even quicker. He said I was lucky. It was bad. But I had five stitches and I'll be fine. It's going to be a bit sore but it's nothing big now and I hope in the next few days it's going to be much better.\" Wayne Rooney has reiterated that he will be at United \"until I'm in my 30s\" after expressing his frustration about the suggestion that his relationship with Ferguson has suffered as a result of his contract dispute with the club last October. \"I'm enjoying my football here and if I was going to leave in the summer I wouldn't have signed a new contract when I did. I've signed it and I intend to see it through to the end.\" Rooney said he had no problem with United being accused of lacking fantasy as they pursue a treble. \"I would take that all day. Look at Inter. They won the Italian treble last season. You wouldn't say they were the most entertaining team to watch but they achieved history.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
