The forward was United\u2019s top scorer last season with 27 goals in all competitions. He has struggled this time around, however, with his goal in Saturday\u2019s 4-1 win over Fulham only Lukaku\u2019s second for the club since mid-September. So far this season, Lukaku has scored six in 20 United appearances, a return that caused Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to drop him for the recent games against Arsenal and Southampton. Asked if he bulked up in the summer, Lukaku said: \u201cA little bit of muscle, yeah. It was at the World Cup. I just felt great and I think I played great over there, and then when I came back it is a different type of style.\u201d While Lukaku scored four in six tournament appearances in Russia, plus twice in a friendly beforehand, he admitted the need to slim back down. \u201cIn the Premier League, I cannot play with the same amount of muscle as international football,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was something that when I came back I knew straight away: \u2018Nah, I cannot play in this style like this.\u2019 I had to lose muscle basically. So you just stay out of the gym, drink a lot of water, and a lot of veg and fish and it helps.\u201d Lukaku also said fatigue has been a factor in his drop-off in form. \u201cAfter the World Cup, I think I really was a bit tired,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you know, I had the same thing in 2014 after the World Cup when I came back to Everton, I was really in a slump after the World Cup. So now I think I am in a decent level again and ready to go again. I knew this. Me and the [United] medical staff, we did like a lot of tests to see what was the problem. I had a hamstring injury, which is something that never happens to me.\u201d Lukaku is now on a different fitness regime. \u201c[There is] more prevention in the gym and I am trying to do speed bursts in training and that\u2019s the most essential,\u201d he said. Asked if scoring in his past two starts for United had eased the pressure, Lukaku added: \u201cNo, not really. I think I just need to keep working hard. Me and the manager had good conversations in the last couple of days, where really he told me what he wanted from me. And I know from my side I have to do better, and I just keep looking forward and improving, trying to add to my game and help the team to win. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing with enough intensity. I played with not enough aggression, I think. Against Fulham I think I played with intensity like everybody else did. I was happy to play at a decent level again and now it\u2019s all about improving and continuing on a consistent basis. We should have scored more. But it has been a long time since we scored four goals and we enjoyed our football today. \u201cI think Fulham didn\u2019t have one shot in the first half, so I mean we showed what we could do. Everybody was really happy with our performance but we have to continue like that.\u201d United\u2019s victory was a first in the league for more than a month and came via goals from Ashley Young, Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford, in addition to Lukaku\u2019s, with Aboubakar Kamara replying for Fulham. The win lifts United to sixth place, eight points behind Arsenal and Chelsea, with the latter in the final Champions League berth on goal difference. \u201cIt was an important win, but we have to continue now,\u201d said Lukaku. \u201cWe have got an important week, an important game against Valencia [in the Champions League] and hopefully we can play with the same intensity like we did today.\u201d Mata\u2019s goal was his 50th in the Premier League, to match his 50 assists. \u201cI\u2019m still hungry for more,\u201d he said. \u201cI want more goals, I want more assists.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
