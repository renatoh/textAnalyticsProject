Republic of Ireland international Kilbane has pace and skill in the mould of a conventional left-winger, but he has never been noted for his scoring power. The Sunderland fans who made the long trek to the south coast witnessed a gem from him that would give them plenty to talk about on the way home. An uninspiring match was heading nowhere until the 54th minute, when Gavin McCann's misdirected free-kick was hooked on the volley by Kilbane from the edge of the area and with his back to goal. Paul Jones, three yards off his line, stood no chance of keeping it out. Even Peter Reid, the Sunderland manager, needed some convincing that Kilbane had meant to do what he achieved. 'He told me it was an intended shot and that was good enough for me,' he confirmed. After this latest setback, Southampton's record under Gray was four defeats in five matches without a goal scored. Little wonder then that the names of Kevin Keegan, Gianluca Vialli and even George Graham were mentioned among fans as they headed for the exits. Gray's final trump card after a series of first-half misses that told of a lack of confidence, was to send on old warrior Matthew Le Tissier. Le Tissier waddled on, patently overweight and short of breath, for the last 25 minutes, and apart from a couple of superb passes straight out of the memory bank, there was little to suggest that he could undermine a Sunderland defence in which Jody Craddock was outstanding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
