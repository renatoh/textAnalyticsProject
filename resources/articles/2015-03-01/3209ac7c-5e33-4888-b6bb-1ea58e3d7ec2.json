Jindal said he would \u201cdraw the line\u201d with a test of intention. \u201cYou have the right to have whatever beliefs you want, you don\u2019t have the right to impose those beliefs in a way that infringes on the freedoms of other people.\u201d Asked about how such a view squares with Jindal\u2019s own anti-abortion position and his attempt last year to shut down Louisiana\u2019s two abortion clinics, Jindal hemmed and hawed before suggesting he meant only the \u201cfreedoms of self-expression, freedom of religion, freedom of speech\u201d. \u201cI would distinguish between people who are pro-life and radical Islamic terrorists, those are two different things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on the beliefs.\u201d Jindal used Isis as his primary example but also said the first Muslim Brotherhood includes \u201cideologies that are hostile to our interests\u201d. \u2018If we don\u2019t insist on\u2019 assimilation we then go the way of Europe\u2019 \u201cSo in other words we shouldn\u2019t tolerate those who want to come and try to impose some variant of, some version of Sharia law,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI fear if we don\u2019t insist on\u201d assimilation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe then go the way of Europe.\u201d European cities, he said warily and without specified examples, included neighborhoods in which women felt afraid to walk without veils. Jindal said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d that such remarks, which follow comments made in London about Muslim \u201cno-go zones\u201d, might be perceived as \u201cracist or anti-Muslim\u201d. He refused, however, to backtrack from any such comments, saying, \u201cIslam has a problem.\u201d In London Jindal made similar remarks, saying \u201cit is completely reasonable for nations to discriminate between allowing people into their country who want to embrace their culture, or allowing people into their country who want to destroy their culture, or establish a separate culture within.\u201d \u201cOf course we\u2019re not at war with Islam,\u201d Jindal said in Washington, \u201cbut of course we are at war with radical Islam and radical Islamist terrorists\u201d. Jindal\u2019s own religious beliefs could be controversial should he reach the next plateau of politics. A convert to Catholicism at a young age, Jindal has courted the born-again Christians and evangelicals with increasing fervor in recent years, even as more Americans choose not to identify with any religion. During college, he also took part in a ritual that resembled an exorcism, though he did not use that word when he described the incident in a 1994 article. In that article Jindal describes a friend\u2019s seizure-like spasms, replete with profane language directed at Jesus Christ, as he and others prayed around her. He concluded that article by saying he believes in \u201cthe reality of spirits, angels and other related phenomena that I can neither touch nor see.\u201d Appointed Louisiana\u2019s secretary of health as a 25-year-old who had been recently named an Oxford\u2019s Rhodes scholar, Jindal was an ascendant starlet of the Republican party for years, winning conservatives as a congressman and governor who rejects all taxes and espouses social causes. Now 43, facing a mammoth $1.6bn budget shortfall in his state, and tacking right in search for national prominence, Jindal is now an outlier in a wide field of conservatives hoping to make a bid in the 2016 presidential election. In the unofficial straw poll taken at CPAC, conservatives\u2019 annual conference, Jindal polled worse than Donald Trump, the reality television bigwig better known for his rufescent hair than his political acumen. Jindal said he is \u201ca couple of months away\u201d from deciding whether to run for president. Instead he appeared to be jostling for position as a vice-presidential candidate for whomever wins the Republican nomination. To that end he repeatedly mentioned several policy \u201cplans\u201d he had written on a number of topics, similar to the economic manifestos produced by Wisconsin representative Paul Ryan during the 2012 campaign. The governor also mentioned his policy on education, which has provoked criticism from academics for years for allowing creationism materials into classrooms, and for the years of budget cuts necessary due to Jindal\u2019s refusal to raise taxes. Jindal said he believes \u201ccurriculum decisions should be made at the local level\u201d, and that \u201cwe should be teaching English as our language, we should be teaching about American exceptionalism in our history classes.\u201d He also took perfunctory jabs at President Obama and pushed for an expanded war against Isis in the Middle East: \u201cYou\u2019ve got officials at the State Department saying, \u2018We\u2019re not going to kill our way out of this war,\u2019 well how else do we win wars if not by killing our way to victory?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
