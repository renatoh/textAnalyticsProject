The pair also announced that they had agreed to cooperate on measures to prevent nuclear terrorism, and Mr Bush said they had agreed that Iran and North Korea should not acquire nuclear weapons. In his opening remarks, Mr Bush said: \"Democracies have certain things in common - a rule of law and protection of minorities and a free press and a viable political opposition. I was able to share my concerns about Russia's commitment in fulfilling these universal principles. I did so in a constructive and friendly way.\" Mr Bush welcomed Mr Putin's statement committing to democracy and said that, in his opinion, it was the Russian president's \"most important\" remark at the press conference. Mr Putin said he and Mr Bush saw \"no alternative to the constant strengthening of Russian-US relations\" and had in common the threat posed by nuclear weaponry in the wrong hands. \"We have common opinions, common approaches,\" he said. Mr Bush, speaking at the end of his three-nation trip to Europe, said they had discussed how \"to continue to protect our people from attacks ... I know the agony, I know the sadness, I know the emotion that comes with innocent people losing their lives\". The two leaders said they did not agree on all issues but Mr Bush said the two countries had more common ground than they disagreed on, and that their discussions had been \"very important and constructive\". He praised Mr Putin's honesty in his dealings with him and said he knew exactly where the Russian president stood on issues, such as Iraq, which Mr Bush said they had disagreed on. Mr Putin said disagreements over democracy and other issues must not be allowed to spoil relations with the United States. He thanked Mr Bush for accepting his invitation to attend May 9 second world war victory celebrations in Moscow. Analysts said that in the private talks Mr Bush was likely to have addressed Washington's concerns that Mr Putin had taken steps to consolidate his power, cracked down on press freedom and attempted to influence last year's elections in Ukraine. At the press conference, Mr Bush said a robust press that challenged his decisions was part of the \"checks and balances\" of democracy. Mr Putin denied that press freedoms in Russia had been curtailed. Speaking ahead of the summit, Janusz Reiter, the head of the Warsaw-based Centre for International Relations, told Reuters that the relationship between the US and Russia was delicate and there were limitations to Washington's influence. The analyst said: \"Making Russia more democratic is a wish, but Bush is probably aware that Russians will do only as much on that as they want. There is not a lever they [the US] can pull on that one.\" Today was the first meeting between Mr Bush and Mr Putin since the US president began his second term in January. \"It's a complex relationship,\" Mr Bush's national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, said before the summit. He told reporters that democracy in Russia remained \"a work in progress\", saying: \"A free and democratic Russia is better for Russia. It's better for us.\" The summit comes almost a year after Mr Putin's convincing re-election victory. However, he is in a weakened position following a series of setbacks at home and abroad, including the Beslan school siege, in which more than 330 people were killed. Bratislava is the final stop on Mr Bush's goodwill tour of Europe this week, which has been designed to mend fences following the war in Iraq."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
