The Scot may have believed Hakkinen's psychological armlock on the McLaren-Mercedes team's affections got in the way of his own formula one world championship ambitions, but no sooner has Hakkinen gone out through one door than he is back through another. Barely a month after the Finn drove his last grand prix prior to taking a sabbatical in 2002, Coulthard has asked if he would consider helping with tyre testing next season. Perhaps, after six years together, Coulthard reckons he has at last found a way of getting Hakkinen to work for him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
