At 103 for one Kent were easing towards a Duckworth-Lewis target of 179 from 39 overs on a rain-affected day at Tunbridge Wells. But a mini-collapse followed the departure of Matthew Fleming (64), before Robert Key's unbeaten 68 helped steer them home. Leicestershire , runners-up to Kent last summer, failed to fire in a 45-run defeat at home to Glamorgan . The Dragons' captain Steve James made 86 towards his team's 194 for six and the Foxes never recovered from a three-wicket spell by Adrian Dale. Warwickshire 's South African-born swing bowler Neil Carter finished with five for 31 as Durham recorded their lowest-ever one-day total of 72 on their way to a seven-wicket defeat at Edgbaston. The Bears took just 11.1 overs to win , having bowled Durham out in 21.2. Yorkshire continued their poor form in all competitions with a six-wicket defeat at the hands of Worcestershire Royals at Headingley. Kabir Ali finished with five for 36 as Yorkshire mustered only 128 in 33.4 overs. Worcestershire knocked off the runs required with almost eight overs to spare. In Division Two, Carl Greenidge's three for 49 against Surrey sneaked Northamptonshire home while Hampshire were even narrower victors over Middlesex at Lord's, winning by two runs after they had made 183 for eight. At Horsham the wicketkeeper-batsman Matt Prior proved his worth with 73 in Sussex's 240 which was 32 runs too good for Essex ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
