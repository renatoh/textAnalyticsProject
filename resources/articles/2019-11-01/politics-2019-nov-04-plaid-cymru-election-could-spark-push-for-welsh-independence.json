Speaking at the nationalist party\u2019s campaign launch, Price put the idea of Wales breaking away from the UK and remaining in the EU as an independent country front and centre of the Plaid campaign. \u201cThat pencil we will all hold in a few weeks could be the start not only of a new politics but a new Wales, a new hope for all of us,\u201d he said. Plaid\u2019s campaign slogan is \u201cWales, it\u2019s us\u201d. Price said: \u201cIt\u2019s us, the people of Wales, that hold the key to the nation\u2019s future \u2026 an independent Wales. \u201cNow is the time to focus on the future, not the past. I believe like never before the best days for Wales are ahead of us, and 12 December [election day] can be a day on which we declare a new Welsh spirit of independence and optimism and hope by refusing to put our faith in the Westminster parties and instead voting for a future that we ourselves will shape. \u201cThis is the election in which Wales will begin to find its voice as a nation. It will start as a whisper, a still, small voice in the darkness, but it will end with a chorus. Speaking with one voice \u2026 Now is our time.\u201d Plaid\u2019s launch took place, as it did in 2017, in a hotel close to the Menai strait in north Wales. Two years ago, the then leader, Leanne Wood, focused on the idea of defending Wales from the Tories in London and the Labour-led government in Cardiff, with independence sidelined. Price took swipes at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, complaining Wales was suffering economically and socially because of decisions made in Westminster and Cardiff. \u201cIn calling the third election in just four years, the Westminster parties certainly have given the people the worst Christmas present ever,\u201d he said, \u201cA political culture that is more toxic than at any time in our history, a poisoned chalice of a choice between two divided parties led by one leader who is resolutely dishonest on Brexit and another who is sadly proven, honestly, clueless. And both of them, as we\u2019ve seen in recent days, advised by public schoolboys who seem to see politics as some kind of pathological game.\u201d But he emphasised the election should be not about \u201cthem\u201d but was instead about \u201cus\u201d. Price argued \u201calmighty lessons\u201d could be learned from the Scottish National party, which had the attention and respect it deserved because of electoral successes. Price said his party\u2019s priorities included a green jobs revolution, a new approach to care, lifting children out of poverty with universal free childcare and a new \u00a335-a-week payment for every child in low-income families, investing in affordable homes, and tackling crime by creating a Welsh justice system, devolving policing and recruiting 1,600 police officers. He did not discuss pacts with other pro-remain parties during his speech, but in interviews given beforehand, Price said such agreements were the way to go. He insisted Plaid was the leading remain party in Wales, seeking to stop Brexit through a \u201cfinal say\u201d referendum, and wanting Wales to become an independent state in the EU. Introducing Price, the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said the times were \u201cdangerous, confused and volatile\u201d but also full of potential. She said the party would look to create harmony with the nearest capital \u2013 Dublin \u2013 and also with London. Saville Roberts also attempted to reach out to voters who may not be traditional Plaid supporters. \u201cWe are the party for Wales and everyone who lives there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Wales is in your heart, we are the party for you.\u201d Speaking after the speech, Price said the party was having \u201cpositive discussions\u201d about taking part in alliances with the pro-remain parties and hope to make an announcement soon. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had extensive discussions, very positive discussions, over many, many weeks and months. In principle, we\u2019re very much supportive of the idea of trying to maximise the number of MPs from pro-Remain parties that are elected from Wales and indeed, of course, there are similar discussions between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in England.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
