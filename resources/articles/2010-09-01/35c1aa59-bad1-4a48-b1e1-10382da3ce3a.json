Now Gill directs, with comparable skill, this weirdly similar new play by a young American writer, Annie Baker. But where Weller's play sticks in my mind as a portrait of a lost generation, marooned between old values and new freedoms, Baker's piece emerges as a cryptic poetic fragment. Baker's setting is the back patio of a Vermont coffee shop where two friends in their early 30s hang out. KJ is a college dropout who lives with his New Age mum, drinks tea laced with psychedelic mushrooms and has vague aspirations to song-writing. His chum, Jasper, describes himself as \"a living piece of trailer trash\", carries a well-thumbed copy of Charles Bukowski's poems and is at work on a sub-Jack Kerouac road-novel. In the past KJ and Jasper hoped to form a band to be known as the Aliens. Now they shoot the breeze until a young coffee-shop temp, Evan, enters their orbit and is slowly magnetised by their laidback lifestyle. As a writer, Baker has many virtues. She neither sentimentalises her characters nor moralises about them: she simply presents them as they are. And, as Fourth of July fireworks explode offstage, she evokes an America that exists outside the familiar ties of patriotism, family and work. But, although her play has a quiet truth, comparisons that have been made with Chekhov flatter her. The elegiac note in Chekhov, as in Weller's Fishing, springs from a rich sense of life. Here the characters, for all Jasper's novelistic hopes, inhabit their own reclusive dreamworld. And, although Evan briefly intrudes on their backyard hideaway, it is never made clear how he has been changed by the experience. The chief pleasure lies in savouring Gill's sensitive, mood-indigo production and watching three excellent actors at work. Ralf Little invests KJ with a vacant-eyed, ruminative gentleness while subtly hinting at some past mental breakdown. The attenuated Mackenzie Crook meanwhile uses his lean, whippet-like frame to suggest that Jasper is filled with some inner rage, possibly deriving from a soured love-affair or his own awareness of a wasted intelligence. And Olly Alexander is touchingly plausible as Evan, torn between his own Jewish family work ethic and awe at his new friends' ability simply to exist from day to day. Lucy Osborne's design, with its gravelly surface and trash-bins, also adds to the desolate atmosphere. But, although the production is exemplary, Baker's play feels like a delicate miniature that never achieves the robust clarity of a dramatic metaphor. Michael Billington Until 16 October.
