These thoughts stayed with her, and 18 years after leaving for the UK, here she is introducing us to Adunni, a 14-year-old girl sold into marriage and then domestic servitude. Despite the dangers, Adunni \u2013 who narrates her own story in a kind of invented English \u2013 won\u2019t be cowed, and sets about finding success in the world through education. An impressive debut novel. The Girl with the Louding Voice by Abi Dare (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a312.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

Lanny Max Porter Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a38.99, pp224 Deservedly longlisted for the Booker prize last year, Max Porter\u2019s follow-up to Grief Is the Thing With Feathers is pithy but overflowing with intense emotion as a village deals with a missing child. Part fable, part mythic poem, Lanny is a wonderfully drawn little boy whom we see through the eyes of many characters and a spirit called Toothwort. Porter is simply fantastic when it comes to portraying the unceasing imagination of children and \u2013 in one shocking scene \u2013 our raw, pressurised love for them. Lanny by Max (Author) Porter (Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a38.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p on all online orders over \u00a315. Fifty Miles Wide Julian Sayarer Arcadia, \u00a39.99, pp311 Travel and cycling writer Julian Sayarer has a motto: he thinks bicycles bring out the best in people. In Fifty Miles Wide he sets off to ride across Israel and occupied Palestine in search of hope, truth and change. That might sound self-indulgent, but Sayarer\u2019s thoughtful, meditative travelogue actually feels very important. This is less a personal adventure than an exploration of how people persevere in the darkest of circumstances. Fifty Miles Wide by Julian Sayarer (Arcadia Books, \u00a39.99).
