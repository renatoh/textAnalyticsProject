Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs were among those to feel his wrath. \"It was one of those long European nights when you don't know if you're watching a game of football or a game of suicide,\" Ferguson said after watching his team beat Internazionale 2-0 through headed goals from Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo. \"We started well and after scoring the first goal I thought we could go on and kill them off, but once we started trying to put the icing on the cake we opened the door for Inter and we were lucky to be ahead at half-time. \"We started doing all these little flicks and balls into space when no one was there \u2013 back-heels and stuff. It was practice football and it allowed them to get a grip of the game. From the middle of the first half until the end of the first half they were the better team. We can play a lot better than that.\" Referring to the first half, Ferguson said that Giggs \"had one of those nights when he was not so great passing\". He was also unusually critical of Scholes. \"He started absolutely fantastic but had a period when he started to give the ball away frivolously. That opened the door for Inter and they started to counter-attack us. In the second half we played more like a European team. It's something we had to drum into the players - that in Europe possession of the ball is so important. I thought they forgot that in the first half.\" Ferguson was more impressed with his centre-halves, describing Vidic as Rio Ferdinand as \"fantastic\" against a side he rated as \"the hardest draw we could have had\". But United's manager seemed no happier than Jose Mourinho, the Inter coach, who had to face a series of hostile questions from the Italian media. Mourinho was typically defiant, saying: \"I don't think anyone should be negative. If people are going to be critical they are going to have to fight with me. We played well but didn't have luck and you need luck in these games. Plus you have to look at the quality of your opponents.\" Mourinho was asked whether he thought United would win a clean sweep of trophies. \"I think they are at the right moment to reach their maximum level. They have experience and quality, great fitness and intensity. The Champions League is all about this. I think, yes, they can do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
