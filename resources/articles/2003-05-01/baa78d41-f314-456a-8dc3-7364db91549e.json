A Ministry of Defence spokesman said yesterday that permission had been refused for a group of rugby league enthusiasts at the academy to play a series of friendly fixtures against teams from the London Amateur Rugby League this summer. The news prompted David Hinchliffe, leader of the Parliamentary Rugby League Group who played a key role in lifting the ban on the code that existed throughout the armed forces until less than a decade ago, to table a question to the MoD. \"I thought we'd resolved this issue back in 1994 and I'm saddened it's cropping up again,\" said the Labour MP for Wakefield. \"I hope it's an aberration not a trend. It's probably down to one person's opinion that's out of line, because the impression I get from the armed forces is one of support for rugby league, which is now widely played and respected in the services.\" The ministry spokesman insisted that rugby league \"has certainly not been banned\" by Sandhurst, explaining that permission for the fixtures had been refused because they had been arranged prematurely, without allowing the sports committee to put in place suitable coaching and insurance. \"A proposal has been put forward to take up rugby league at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and is being considered as a possibility for inclusion in the sporting programme next season,\" he said. \"Consideration is now being given to the required coaches, officials, equipment, infrastructure and so forth that is required to support such a sport. A decision to take up a new sport such as rugby league is not something that can be taken lightly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
