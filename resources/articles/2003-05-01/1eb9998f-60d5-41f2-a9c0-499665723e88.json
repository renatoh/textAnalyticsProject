Week 4: your school", "bodyText": "The activities this week contribute to an end-product of a mixed-media collage that will highlight the different visual qualities of the building and the feelings and emotions associated with it. Activity 1: Patterns around school Take a group of children and a digital camera around the school and photograph patterns and shapes in different areas: eg floor and wall tiles, brickwork, paving, stairs, doors, windows, roof tiles. Can the rest of the class identify the location of each photo? It may not always be obvious. Discuss the shapes and patterns. Are they regular? Symmetrical? Decorative? Functional? Geometric? Colourful? Take a different group around the school to make rubbings of the different patterned surfaces they can find. Look for brick and tile work, floor coverings, paving and wall textures. Can the others guess where the rubbing was taken? Describe the patterns in terms of their shape, texture and relevance to where they were found. Activity 2: Isolate a section Choose different aspects of the school building, inside and out, and isolate sections with distinct and interesting patterns or decoration with a small viewfinder. Sketch the chosen details using a soft pencil, charcoal or crayon. Each child should choose a variety of places to sketch and compare the differences between each. Extend the viewfinder to include a part of the whole structure. Children sketch part of the building, which could include a corner piece, a door and window, the school entrance, the point where the roof meets the brickwork or any other interesting feature. Activity 3: Make a print Discuss how the shapes and patterns in the photographs, rubbings and sketches could be used as a stimulus for printmaking. Collect a variety of tools and objects to print the different shapes and lines found around the school. Use this as an opportunity to discuss the geometric and decorative features of the patterns collected. Which patterns were regular/irregular? Which had straight/circular/ wavy lines? Which were symmetrical? Children need to ask themselves these questions to help select the appropriate tools for making their chosen print and explain the reasons for their choice. Activity 4: Who makes a school? Using the knowledge gained in previous weeks about the purposes of different buildings in the community, start a discussion about the spaces in and around the school. What is significant about the entrance? The hall? The corridors? The dining room? Why do they think the building has this particular design? Does it work for the purpose for which it was built? What would they change about it? Who makes a school what it is? Collect a bank of words associated with the feelings the children have towards their school. They can use a suitable word processing programme to type up the list, changing the font, size and colour of each word. These words will be used later when putting together the final collage. Activity 5: The final collage The final activity involves combining the photos, rubbings, sketches, prints and words to make a mixed-media collage. Discuss ideas for the design, and decide which parts of the building should be represented and how. Children can work individually on panels and then put them together, or work in pairs or small groups. The end result will be a collage that represents the school in terms of its shapes, patterns and decoration and the children's feelings towards it. Plenary Discuss the way the children have used their observations to develop the collage. Are the sections effective as a whole-class collage? What does the finished piece communicate about the school? Would they do anything differently next time? At home Ask the children to look for objects with distinctive patterns, eg. a cheese grater, etc. Ask the children to consider why these objects are patterned in the way they are. Differentiation within the class These activities require children to work collaboratively and provide opportunities for mixed-ability group work. Some children may need help to work the digital camera and with selecting appropriate tools for printing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
