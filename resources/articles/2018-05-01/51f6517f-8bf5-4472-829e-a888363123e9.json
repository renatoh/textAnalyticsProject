The only problem was what had come before: a 77-game losing streak dating back to 19 May 2016, when they scraped past Rider 8-7. That streak included a few close games but it was mostly a tale of massacres for the Peacocks. In a particularly ugly few days at the start of this month they conceded 49 runs in just two games. Saint Peter\u2019s, based in Jersey City, New Jersey, play in Division I, the highest level of college baseball although their record over the last few seasons suggests they may be better off somewhere a little lower down. Their victory on Sunday left them with a 1-39 record in 2018. Last year they went 0-38, a slump from the relatively heady days of 2016 when they went 10-42. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of anything like this,\u201d head coach Danny Ramirez said at the end of last season, unaware of what was to come in 2018. The Peacocks have some baseball pedigree. They have had eight players drafted in the MLB draft, the most recent being Conor Mullee, who had a brief career with the New York Yankees after being selected in 2010. Despite their two seasons of pain, the Peacocks are far from matching the achievements of other college baseball teams. Caltech, who play at a much lower level, ended a 228-game losing streak in 2011. Their previous victory had been in 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
