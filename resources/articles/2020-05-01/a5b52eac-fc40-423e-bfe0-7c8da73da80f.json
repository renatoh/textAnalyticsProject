Jones is the top-rating talkback breakfast presenter in Sydney and made the announcement he would quit at the end of the month on his regular 2GB show on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe are living in the world of coronavirus,\u201d Jones told listeners. \u201cThe most repeated statement we hear is \u2018we must listen to the experts\u2019. Well, the experts are telling me in no uncertain terms, and not for the first time I might add, \u2018continuing with the present workload is seriously detrimental to your health\u2019. \u201cI have listened to the experts and I am taking this opportunity to indicate to my radio family that I will be retiring from radio at the end of this month.\u201d The departure of the 79-year-old broadcaster comes earlier than his planned retirement from 2GB at the end of his contract in June 2021 and would be a relief for Nine Radio, which was paying him $4m a year despite an advertiser boycott which stripped 50% of the show\u2019s revenue last year. Jones is also costing his employer millions in legal fees, including $3.4m in damages for being \u201cwilfully blind to the truth\u201d when he made \u201cvicious and spiteful\u201d comments about the Toowoomba-based Wagner family in 2018. The broadcaster has dominated breakfast radio in Sydney for 35 years, recording an unequalled 226 survey wins, but his conduct on air has led to the radio station losing advertisers and haemorrhaging revenue. His program had been under review by what was then Macquarie Media after hundreds of advertisers pulled out in the wake of his comments about the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. After Jones said Scott Morrison should shove a sock down Ardern\u2019s throat, 2GB and 4BC suffered an exodus of advertisers across the schedule. His retirement comes nine months after management said he was on his final warning for offensive comments and took the unprecedented step of scolding him publicly. Nine Entertainment\u2019s chief executive, Hugh Marks, made it clear Jones was not indispensable when he said Jones\u2019 breakfast show was \u201cless than 10% of the revenue of the radio business and a fraction of the revenue of Nine\u201d. \u201cAlan\u2019s a good broadcaster, Macquarie have made plenty of comments about their relationship and recent events so I won\u2019t go into that, but yes, of course, that business can survive the loss of any of its talent,\u201d Marks said after Nine acquired the remaining shares in Macquarie Media. Jones has survived numerous controversies, including cash-for-comment on 2UE in 1999 and the attacks on Julia Gillard in 2012. The broadcaster said the then prime minister should be \u201cshoved in a chaff bag\u201d and later that her father had died \u201cof shame\u201d because she \u201ctold lies every time she stood for parliament\u201d. Reaction to his announcement was immediate, with praise from some and criticism from others. The managing director of Nine Radio, Tom Malone, told staff that loyalty was at the centre of \u201ceverything Alan does\u201d. \u201cHe has been loyal to this company and to his listeners \u2013 their greatest advocate \u2013 and they have repaid him in kind with their ears and their hearts,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHis success in radio stemmed from an already rich and experienced life in teaching, sport and politics. He can talk with equal ease to prime ministers and the everyday person. Of course, we know and love him for his unique turn of phrase and warm sense of humour. I\u2019ll always remember one of my first days in the 2UE newsroom as a cadet in the late 90s, when Alan advised me: \u2018If you\u2019re going to be a dog, be an Alsatian\u2019.\u201d Nine clearly had a succession plan, immediately announcing that the drive host, Ben Fordham, a Channel Nine veteran, would replace Jones. \u201cI feel a sense of both responsibility and opportunity,\u201d Fordham said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge responsibility in taking over from Alan and the opportunity to bring my own flavour to breakfast.\u201d Scott Morrison called in to Jones\u2019 show as politicians across the spectrum lined up to congratulate him. \u201cYou\u2019ve always spoken your mind to everyone, including me, and we\u2019ve had one or two disagreements, but you\u2019ve always done the right thing for your country,\u201d the prime minister said. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, wished him well and the former prime minister Tony Abbott called in and told Jones \u201cit was a significant day\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
