Perhaps less pressingly but no less embarrassingly, it is apparently reaching a climax during Paris fashion week, traditionally the most luxurious on the fashion calendar and which generally sees no problem with the idea of handbags for more than \u00a31,000. Even fashion designers cannot fail to note that the relatively easy retail ride they have had for the past decade may well be ending. But how to combine the inevitably luxurious nature of their wares with the oncoming general mood of prudence and caution? Designer Dries van Noten attempted to find a middle road in his show in Paris yesterday which he described as \"opulence with optics and warm modernism\". In layman's terms, this amounted to the easy, slouchy styles for which the designer is known, with occasional luxe touches, such as fat strings of metallic beads fastening the occasional halterneck tops and a splash of gold sequins across a loose and light tunic dress. Van Noten, like Prada, has always been a designer for smart women, as opposed to emaciated teenagers. His cuts are for a woman who knows that it's sexier just to hint at the body beneath than to get out the cleavage. Colours in yesterday's show started as just graphic black and white before softening to warm burnished reds, regal purples and sunny mustards, all of which worked beautifully on the light and loose fabrics used for the low slung trousers and mid-length dresses. Even the section of heavily beaded and gilded dresses and coats kept his low key shapes so they did not look out of sync with the times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
