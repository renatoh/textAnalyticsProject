Drag your mind from the gutter, Guide readers, for we're merely talking about the ligament-damaging delights of trying to gain infinite lives by hammering up, right, left, up, right, down, A, B, left, right, start. With Sonic The Hedgehog, Mario and some gigantic psychedelic mushrooms taking leading roles, the original console-game characters were stars of their time, pixelated pop culture icons who clawed their way deeper into a generation's psyche than Noel Gallagher, New Labour and the nympho lawyers in This Life ever could. This week Nintendo launch their Wii console, a state of the art piece of kit guaranteed to make the retro games of yore look like relics thanks to titles such as, ummm, Super Mario Galaxy and Sonic &amp; The Secret Rings. They're also launching Virtual Console, a video game download service that allows you to get your thumbs on a whole host of retro classics from Altered Beast to Zelda. So just what's going on? Have Nintendo fried their brains from so much gaming that they've finally ran out of ideas? Have the stoners who used to slob out on your student sofa keeping Sega (and Cheesy Wotsits) in business all gone and got staff jobs at Kyoto HQ? Or are the boffins behind this scheme actually a bunch of smart little bastards who've spotted the booming scene of musicians, artists and movie-makers currently hard at work twisting the 8-bit bleeps'n'blobs of retro games into thrilling new shapes and sounds? Take Hadouken!, a punk grime outfit from Leeds who, after just a handful of gigs, are causing dancefloor riots on the indie party circuit. Named after a special fireball move on Capcom's Street Fighter II, their music takes in everything from east London grime to skinny-boy indie and is partly-constructed from spliced samples nicked from GameBoy circuitry. \"Movie samples were pillaged by the dance music community throughout the last decade,\" says band mastermind James. \"I think you would be more likely to hear a reference to videogames nowadays. Games are fun, they're what resonate with our generation.\" Their manifesto of \"young, smart and full of art\" translates, on the surface, to Day-Glo clothes and disco hedonism, something that ties them in with the current wave of new rave bands like Trash Fashion and Klaxons. Although James reckons it's less a rave revival thing and more about rejecting the \"drab ideals which are becoming more and more tedious as the next Feeling or Kooks clone dominates the mainstream\", it's obvious that retro gaming and rave music share an aesthetic bond. No surprises, then, that one of the scene's figureheads is London's Carri Mundane (aka Cassette Playa), a unisex designer who based her entire last collection on Green Hill, the first level of Sonic The Hedgehog. Excuse us one moment while we ask WTF? \"Sonic The Hedgehog is a fucking dude!\" beams Carri, who sees an unlikely fashion icon in the blue lycra-clad garden mammal. \"Bad boy looks and speed! Unlike Mario or most other characters, Sonic still looks like the future. Also, Lemmings was amazing. It's mad how much character you can get into a few purple and green pixels. And Earthworm Jim! What a weirdo! He could slip out of his space suit and whip enemies with his own wormy body! Sweet skill!\" It's fashion fact that her fullbody blue hedgehog suits are set to be the must-have accessory on Bolton high street next season (relax, we're kidding - it's more likely to break in 2008). But before this all gets a bit Nathan Barley, let us point out that less extreme versions of her Day-Glo threads are currently splattered everywhere, from festival sites to underage club nights. Delve further underground and there's an army of creative oddballs making music out of console noises, hoping that Sonic's \"boing\" makes a neat bassline or that their snaredrum needs will be catered for by the thwack noises on John Madden's Football. DJ Scotch Egg, Germlin and David E Sugar are just three artists making music from console sound chips, and if you're the sort of person who's always been frustrated that HMV lacks a Prog-Metal Bands Who Cover The Zelda Tune section then you should check out the weirdness that is ARMCANNON, whose timesignature trashing covers of the Mario World Castle Theme need to be heard to be believed. Elsewhere MCs like 8 Bit have found themselves working with the likes of Beck, remixing tracks on his Guerolito LP, whereas retro-futurist bands like To My Boy and Crystal Castles are prompting much critical saliva thanks to their dizzy, toytown music guaranteed to get you jumping around like Dean Gaffney with a cockroach up his arse. With modern gaming promoting a geekoid, lock-yourself- in-yer-bedroom way of life (yeah, that's you, Second Life and World Of Warcraft), this Crayola-coloured revolution is all about youthful energy, ideas and excitement. Which is why it's cool for the Arctic Monkeys to write a song in honour of Chun-Li's spinning bird kick - a special move that had thousands of teenage boys experimenting with their pause button - and for grime artist JME to rap about fat Italian plumbers on Deadout without losing his menace factor. Visit YouTube and you'll find an army of DIY movie makers splicing Sonic cartoons up against tracks by bands such as My Chemical Romance, whereas Zephyrising's online art-films fuse drum'n'bass music with 8-bit graphics. Modern computer game companies are catching on, too. This year, Electronic Arts ran a battle of the bands competition, inviting young acts to fight it out over who would soundtrack their game Burnout. In the end The Styles scooped the prize, a garage rock band from Italy. You can't help thinking EA missed a trick in not recruiting one of these pioneers instead. So how far can the retro-gaming thing go? One hacker, Brooklyn artist Cory Arcangel, managed to reprogram a game cartridge so that it displayed an endless procession of the game's lo-res clouds. The result? His piece, Super Mario Clouds, ended up in New York's Whitney museum. Last week, London's Hammersmith Apollo staged a concert by Video Games Live, an orchestra and lazer show that's taken its covers of computer game theme tunes everywhere from S\u00e3o Paolo to Sydney. It gets weirder. In 2005, a rock opera about Super Mario (the creatively named Mario Opera) debuted in California. A visit to the opera's website tells you that the songwriter Jonathan Mann is currently holed up, penning 40 folk songs - 40! - in honour of the Nintendo Wii console. Head to www.the-mario-opera.com/wii and you can hear such future pop classics as Wii Means You And Me and The Wind Whispers Wii. Elsewhere, London's Science Museum is running a major history of gaming exhibition until February. Oh, and remember that Street Fighter film, released in 1994? The one that starred Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie that nobody went to see? They're making another one, due in 2008. Maybe with the new gaming resurgence it might just work out this time. Look around and the influence is everywhere, from contemporary household designs (www.supernice.co.uk) to the muse of guerilla artists like the anonymous Space Invader, who has made it his mission to install urban space invader murals across the globe, from Paris to Perth. Even those who despise the cutting edge are getting involved with retro-games. Jack White is a man with so much hatred towards the modern world he'd flog his own amplifiers if it were possible. His band the Raconteurs must have balked at the thought of having to design something as modern as a website, so they made it as deliberately out of date as possible, basing it around an old Spectrum interface. Such antics, though, are based on looking to the past, while for the likes of Hadouken! and Cassette Playa, this is more than a cloud of nostalgia drifting briefl y over the world of fashion. Rather, it's a dynamic movement born out of a love for gaming and something that's as ingrained in them as any movie scene or hit record. \"We're the generation who grew up on gaming,\" says Cassette Playa. \"Our minds are built out of Tetris blocks, so they're the shapes our imaginations will build. Retro gaming has an 8-bit simplicity that totally lodges in your head and heart.\" So what bit of kit will the DIY kids dismantle next? Well, that's for them to decide. Tamagotchi owners - you have been warned. Wii are your friends David McNamee takes a look at the pixelated heroes hoping for a Wii-birth... Sonic the hedgehog Fast, sexy, streamlined and exuding cool in his electric blue finish, Sonic is everything Mario ain't. Although the urchin's popularity couldn't save the Sega consoles from extinction, Sonic lives on in the Wii's Sonic &amp; The Secret Rings. Mario Mario, a fat, middle-aged Italian plumber, is not exactly a design classic. But Mario is unlikely enough to make Nintendo's out-there gaming physics seem plausible. With Yoshi and pals he's got the coolest backing troupe this side of the Scooby Gang. Guybrush Threepwood Monkey Island's wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood is a fop, a failure and a pop culture obsessive. He is us. Hilariously, Threepwood recently topped a poll of the hottest game characters ever. Sadly, no Monkey Island games are in the pipeline. Link Resembles the humble, honourable males in Miyazaki's anime - each game begins with Link as an ordinary village boy facing a daunting rites of passage. The much-loved character's Legend Of Zelda Wii debut has already been hailed as a classic. Pac-man Although too antiquated for the Wii, the simplicity and lurid colour of Pac-Man made the arcade game a pop art classic. Pac-Man has appeared in board games, cartoons, Pac-Man pasta, in crop circles outside Reading, and even Pac-Man acid tabs. Shodan Forget Lara Croft. System Shock's (now deceased) Shodan is 10,000 terabytes of PMS, a Hal 2000-gone-bitch-ass supercomputer with delusions of godhood. This villain is the \"bad mother\" archetype, rewired in unloving, unfemale circuitry and code. PaRappa the rapper \"I gotta believe!\" is PaRappa's sweet, self-help catchphrase, and the gamer helps the Playstation-only 2D puppy learn how to bake cakes, drive and, uh, go to the toilet all through the medium of stilted rap and lovably uncool dance moves. Street Fighter II As the 12 characters from Street Fighter II pop-up repeatedly in pop cultural references, they'd be perfect for the Wii's nostalgia-fest. Arctic Monkeys, Family Guy and a myriad of kung-fu films have all paid tribute to Chun-Li, Ryu and co. Sam &amp; Max Sam (a 6ft, laconic, canine gumshoe) and Max (his gleefully psychotic \"hyperkinetic rabbity thing\" sidekick), became cult heroes with their 1993 LucasArts debut. Nintendo are now securing the rights to the nihilistic, surreal duo for the Wii. Toejam and Earl Toejam and Earl - two cool alien dudes from the planet \"Funkotron\" - are slated for a Wii reissue. The pair's excruciating rap slang and the original Sega game's cheesy 16-bit approximations of 1970s funk marks them as a precursor to PaRappa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
