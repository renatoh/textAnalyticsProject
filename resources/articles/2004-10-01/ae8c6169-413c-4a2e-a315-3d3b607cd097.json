But the dominant noise you hear in the English countryside is not, and never has been, any of these. It is the steady, unwavering, nerve-shredding noise of bleating. Not the relatively relaxing, chilled-out bleat of sheep, but the incessant, much harder to ignore bleat of that never-knowingly-satisfied figure, the English Countryman. Of the several clever things done by the Countryside Alliance, the most astute was the way in which it harnessed this general sense of grievance for its single issue. Foxhunting is not a popular cause anywhere in the UK, and it isn't much more popular in the countryside, where class differences are at least as sharp, and as full of resentment, as they are in town. But one thing almost everyone in the country has, in addition to their specific grievances - phone masts, bypasses, closing post-offices - is a vivid feeling of being generally hard done by. The Countryside Alliance has drawn on that hard-done-by-ness with great skill. Outsiders, however, find the bleating hard to understand. If you, like me, are one of the 71.5% of Britons who lives in an urban environment, then you may find yourself wondering exactly what it is that countrysiders are moaning about. After all, one of the most robust indicators of how satisfactory a place is to live is whether or not people want to go and live there. In France, for instance, rural life is so quiet and so boring that there has been, for generations, a consistent pattern of internal migration from the country to the town. This is the general pattern across the developed world: people go to live in cities because they have better lives there. Not in Britain, though. For 2002, the last year in which there were accurate figures, a net 115,400 people moved out of urban environments into the countryside. In other words, every year a city slightly bigger then Exeter disappears, and reappears wearing green wellies and complaining about the bypass. This has been going on for a decade and a half. Why? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that people in the countryside have a relatively higher standard of living, better health care, better schools, and live longer. So what's with all this complaining? My own feelings about the English countryside were shaped by the contrast between them and the Far East, where I grew up. We moved to rural Norfolk from Hong Kong, which at that point was the most crowded city in the world. Compared to that, Norfolk was a paradise of space and light and fresh air. Our house was near the Broads, and I would go out in a canoe to explore the network of dykes and rivers almost every day. There was a kingfisher who lived near where I hid the canoe, and the electric-blue shock of his underbelly, so startling among the greens and greys of the reeds, was, every time I saw it, the high point of my day. As a city boy, I had not known that any natural phenomenon could be the high point of a day. A pair of bitterns lived in the marsh, and during the spring you could hear the male's astonishing foghorn boom from, literally, miles away. I thought about taking up birdwatching, but gave up after one afternoon, during which I counted 47 house sparrows. The most exotic of the local fauna was the coypu. A coypu is a 2ft-long \u00fcber-rat with-and this is the clincher - red-orange teeth. They are a rodent cross between Arnold Schwarzennegger and Dracula. At night they used to break in to our vegetable patch (which we had fenced to keep them out) and make terrifying howling sounds, a cross between cats in a sack and hungry human babies. Cool! That was part of the magic of Norfolk, that it had real wild nature in it. Hong Kong was a place of convulsive change, where familiar landmarks would disappear overnight; rural Norfolk seemed calm, stable, and permanent. I was dead wrong about all that. Twenty-plus years later, Britain's coypus are extinct: they were exterminated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food because of the damage they did to riverbanks. Bitterns are down to their last 50-odd breeding pairs; I spoke to a birdwatcher who said he hadn't heard one in 10 years. Last week, house sparrows were put on the endangered species list; their population has declined by 62% in 25 years, and nobody knows why. The fact that the Broads look more or less the same disguises marked and sudden ecological changes. What I didn't know was the the Broads were not, and never had been, a wild place. Their very existence is the legacy of human actions, from medieval peat diggings. That is typical of the British countryside. There is no nature left in this country. Nothing here is untouched: since the great bronze-age deforestation, man has made his mark everywhere in these islands. Even our greatest, most beautiful landscapes, the Lake District or the Yorkshire Dales, are man-made, created by deforestation and agriculture. (In fact, part of the beauty of England's great landscapes, in the north or in the west, is their human scale, their intimacy: we have no Alps here, let alone any Grand Canyons. Our landscapes don't make us feel small.) Everything in Britain is the product of a choice. So the first thing we have to do when thinking about the countryside is accept that there is no nature here, only culture: only things that we have made and chosen. The way our countryside looks, and the ways we live in it, are products of our choices, and we must let go of any fantasies about nature and timelessness and stasis. We must choose the countryside we want. We have to ask, what is the countryside for? Some of this choosing is simple - not always easy to execute, but simple. We want our beautiful \"nature\" spots kept the way they are, so we turn them into national parks. Running the national parks is not easy. There are 12 million visits a year to the Lake District alone; this wild, natural place needs a lot of managing if it is going to stay that way. But at least we can agree on that. We want our agreed beautiful places to stay as beautiful as possible, and that means we have to treat them as if they were in themselves a finite resource. That, unfortunately, is where the simple part of the choosing ends. For the rest, we have to face a paradox about the countryside, which is that there is a stark division between the land and the people who live on it. Of the 45 million habitable acres in Britain, 4 million is urban plot, and 41 million is agricultural land. But that agricultural land employs only 2% of the working population. So whom do you talk to when you want to talk about the countryside? If you want to talk about the 90% of our countryside which is given over to farmland, you have to talk to a farmer. But you have to bear in mind that farmers, while they represent the overwhelming majority of the land surface of our country, represent an almost invisible minority of the people who live here. They are increasingly aware of it, too. \"When I was growing up I thought people liked farmers,\" Steve Wilson, an arable farmer from mid-Norfolk, told me. \"My dad was a farmer, and, you know, there was this sense that people thought of farmers as a good thing. But over the last years that seems to have changed. You started hearing that farmers complained all the time, and that we get all these subsidies, and so on. And the coverage is all different now, it's hostile.\" Wilson produces more than his father did out of the large flat fields of their property. He is clearly prosperous, but, equally clearly, is stressed. He looks like a red-faced outdoors type, but when he talks about his work it is like hearing someone in a high-pressured City job. \"You have this fantasy of being allowed to just get on with it. But that's not what it's like at all.\" I asked around about this. It seems to be true: people who aren't directly involved in agriculture and old-type country life don't seem to have much love of people who are. Class politics exist in the country at least as much as in town. Some of this is to do with old ways versus new ways, or, more accurately, old money versus new. A man in a cravat, whispering, told me about pheasant shoots where \"nooves\" (his word) \"and rock stars\" kill a thousand birds in a day, so many that some of them are ploughed under rather than sold. \"I think it's wicked,\" said my informant. (In the countryside, posh people still use the word \"wicked\" to mean \"wicked\".) I told Wilson that the night before I spoke to him, I had been staying at a local pub, with comfy bedrooms and the disconcertingly good - and not cheap - food you increasingly find in England's pubs. The conversation was about a local farmer who was digging up a field and kept causing power cuts. \"You can tell he feels guilty,\" one of the locals said, \"because he stops and chats to people in the village. Not that he'd ever admit it.\" Wilson shrugged. \"Time was when farmers were the local community. Now, we're not.\" He waved around him at his farm office, which had the endemic scruffiness of farm back rooms. A VAT registration certificate was pinned to the wall next to a FHM Honeyz poster. \"We think of this as the main purpose of the countryside, but in lots of ways now it's not. We're more cut off.\" He told me that he couldn't go and drink in the pubs he liked as a young man because it is used by former farm-workers whom he had made redundant. So the answer to our question about \"what is the countryside for\", is, in practise, \"growing food\". But this is not what most of the people who live in the countryside do. Mark Miller, a schoolfriend of mine who moved back to Norfolk from a job in the City, took me on a drive round the village where he grew up. When I asked him why he had moved back, and cut his salary by more than 50%, he said, without missing a beat, \"quality of life\". \"But everyone who lives in the country seems to complain all the time\"' I said. He shrugged. \"Of course they do. People feel culturally invisible, they feel no one cares about them and no one knows anything about their lives. They feel modern Britain sees them as irrelevant. That's what they're really complaining about. But in straight quality of life terms, there's no question you're better off in the country.\" \"Most of the land around here is now consolidated in the hands of a single farmer,\" he went on. \"Out of a village population of a few hundred, only about 10 work on the land, and most of them work for other farmers. Mostly people are commuters who live in Norwich. One or two work from home.\" He listed the professions: some were in the service industry cutting hair or cleaning houses or teaching pilates. \"There's a self-employed businessman or two. There's a bloke who made a bomb trading shares online and then lost it in the tech crash. There's a village idiot and a village wife-beater and a couple who are supposed to be swingers. All the usual stuff.\" The village still has a shop and a primary school. One thing which there isn't locally is any foxhunting. There are no hunts near by and even if there were: \"The farmer wouldn't allow it.\" Who represents these people? What single body speaks for them? Well, nobody, really. They live in a rural setting, but, like most people who live in rural settings in Britain, their lives are economically tied to town. An increasing number of them live on the estates like the new one which had suddenly appeared on the way out to our old home from Norwich. This was a road I had taken perhaps a thousand times, in car and on foot, on bike and motorbike, drunk and sober, happy and sad, in every stage of teenage love and teenage dumpedness, and once walking my bike home on its back wheel seven miles at two in the morning because someone had nicked the front one. Turning off down the road on this visit, though, I had to stop because it no longer existed. A brand new, hideous housing estate was built right in the way. Large signs invited me to inspect a display house. If I hurried and bought a small one, I might have change from \u00a3200,000. The quiet road-to-nowhere to our village now involved me doubling back and taking a detour down a roaring dual carriageway. These semi-country estates are going to be more and more of a factor in country life. You can't help but wonder what they're going to be like to live on. Simon Pinker, now a hard-living London adman hitting 40, grew up on one, \"near Windsor if you wanted to sound like a nob, or in Bracknell if you were trying to sound tough\". He says that \"the main feeling you have, especially a teenager, is that life is happening to someone else\". Life in these places - which are exurban, really, to do with the spread of city into the country - is, according to him, dull. Once he had left to go to college, Pinker never lived at home again. \"They're great for young people, and great for old people, and incredibly boring for everybody in the middle. And it is essential that you drive, or have access to a car. On my estate, if you didn't pass your driving test at your first attempt, everybody assumed you were homosexual.\" These estates are changing the British countryside. Norfolk - sleepy, Alan Partridgesque Norfolk, famously preserved by the fact that it isn't on the way to anywhere - has 72,600 new houses in John Prescott's brilliant masterplan to cover the whole of south and eastern England with Barratt show-homes. That is a new city the size of Norwich, already the biggest city in the county by far. This won't involve convulsive, revolutionary change. Nothing dramatic will happen. It's just that life will be, in dozens of small ways, slightly worse: more people, more traffic, more noise, more pollution, more queuing, more time spent at the check-out, longer waiting times at the doctor and the den tist and the hospital, a tighter blast-area of selection by postcode around the good schools, and a general sense that the reasons for wanting to live in the countryside in the first place are gradually and irrevocably fading away. A funny thing happens when people talk about this, though. You listen to all the specifics, nodding politely, and - if you live in an urban environment - with part of your head thinking that this doesn't sound too bad, really. Then about half the time the person you are talking to will use the word \"community\". They will say, \"the community is going\", or there is \"less sense of community\", or they \"miss the feeling of community\". This is the point at which people lose me. I know that community is supposed to be a good thing and that we are all supposed to live in one. It's just that it seems to me to be a fact of modern countryside life that community, in this hearth-hallowed, warm-glow sense, doesn't exist. Far more than the town, the countryside is an atomised, fragmented place. I don't know whether the underlying factors in this are economic (the principal one being perhaps that countrysiders go somewhere else to earn their living, then return to their little boxes to live privately) or psychological (in that people who move to the country are doing so at some level to get away from other people). But I have lived in quite a few places in quite a few different countries, and I have never lived anywhere as essentially unfriendly, broken-up, atomised and fragmented as the English countryside. That was, in the end, the reason we left. Our house had a few acres of marsh land - unusable but beautiful - attached. One day I took my father out in my canoe and we saw that a stretch of trees, mainly beautiful low-hanging willows, had been cut down. It had obviously happened very recently. We investigated and found out that, with nods and winks, a group of locals had agreed to cut down our trees, in order to allow access for sailing boats down a side-creek. Nobody asked my father, and the feeling that the same people who would smile and nod and make small-talk about the weather would do this behind his back caused him to feel he couldn't live in that place any more. He realised that after 11 years, he was still an outsider; that the locals still did not trust him. He felt a deep, bitter, sense of personal betrayal. It gave him an intense feeling of insecurity. By my next holiday from university, three months later, he had sold the house and moved into Norwich. Three months after that he died of a heart attack. The business with the trees did not cause that, but it certainly did not help. It seems to me that people in the English countryside are trapped between the immovable conservatism of our patterns of land use, and the irresistible changes brought by population pressure. You can, on reflection, see why they are prone to complaint. But when they mourn the loss of a sense of community, they are asking us to mourn something which died a long time ago if, indeed, it ever existed. And there is another factor to consider when listening to the countryside blues. Although the countryside I visited had changed, the place which had looked like it had changed the most, and most for the worst, was Norwich. \"This used to be a charming city,\" Miller told me. \"You see that slogan on the sign as you're driving in: Norwich, a Fine City\". It makes you laugh because it's so Alan Partridge but the thing is it used to be true. For one thing Norwich is just the right size. It was always coming top in quality-of-life rankings for the best place to live in the UK. Now, though, it's all changed. The shoe factory closed, the chocolate factory closed. There are these hideous developments everywhere. And then the main thing is these pissed-up groups coming into the city in the evenings. It turns the city centre into a no-go area.\" All this, of course, is another story, and not strictly relevant to what has happened in the countryside. But it is worth bearing this in mind, the next time you hear a countrydweller having a bleat. \"Life in the countryside might have got worse,\" Miller told me, \"but life in the centre of Britain's cities has got worse quicker. That's why we choose to live in the country. We're not thick.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
