Operations director Derek Moore said it had wanted to include the country for several years but had to wait until the end of civil unrest. The Foreign Office advises against travel only in the South. The key attraction is the Pyramids of Meroe. Moore said: 'You drive through the vast sandy deserts and then reach these pyramids in the middle of nowhere. Unlike Cairo's pyramids, there isn't a gift shop or camel-ride seller in sight.' Two days of the 10-day tour are spent in Khartoum before you head to the pyramids and other archaeological treasures. Travellers should be prepared for some rough desert driving and simple, wild camps. \u00b7 Prices start from \u00a31,595.Call 01252 760 000.
