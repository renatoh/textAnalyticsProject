And it was hot. I had the choice of sweating inside my coat or getting soaked. This felt about right \u2013 when WG Sebald arrives at this quiet Suffolk port in The Rings of Saturn, the day is \u201cdull and oppressive\u201d. Sebald catches a boat from Orford harbour to Orford Ness. This desolate shingle spit was closed off for military testing during the cold war and only opened up to the public in the early 90s, not long before Sebald took his journey. He tells us stories about \u201cdeath rays\u201d that were tested there, as well as \u201ca system of pipes\u201d that could unleash a \u201cpetroleum inferno\u201d and set the surrounding sea boiling. He describes a place of such \u201cgodforsaken loneliness\u201d that people who stayed there too long found themselves \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d. It sounded fantastic, but there were no boats running. I could only gaze across the brown waters of the River Alde towards the installations in the distance: black pagodas like temples to strange, dark gods, and concrete bunkers humped against the imminent prospect of a nuclear war. It\u2019s easy to see why Sebald talks so often about combustion and destruction. Even if I\u2019d made it across the water, I could never have followed him. He explores a dreamlike landscape, wandering around as if after an apocalypse: \u201cWhere and in what time I truly was that day at Orford Ness I cannot say, even now as I write these words.\u201d I walked under grumpy grey skies across Dunwich\u2019s empty heath, which Sebald says \u201clies forlorn above the sea\u201d. Trudging through that great emptiness I drifted into dark thoughts that echoed his. Sizewell nuclear power station lurked in the distance, \u201cits magnox block a glowering mausoleum\u201d. Sebald gets lost on Dunwich Heath, suffering nightmarish visions of mazes that seem to resemble cross-sections of his brain. Eventually he is \u201cdead tired and ready to lie down anywhere\u201d. He has walked too far. I may have been driving as well as walking, but my day in Suffolk was enough to make clear the physical element of Sebald\u2019s journey. He really put the miles in. Aside from that brief moment of exhaustion on Dunwich Heath, fatigue is barely mentioned. I was intending to follow him on foot across the old railway bridge between Walberswick and Southwold, but when I realised just how far Sebald tramped to get there I had to turn back to the car. Arriving in Southwold, the lighthouse was still as white and bright as Sebald describes. I headed up to Gun Hill, where on 28 May 1672 residents witnessed a sea battle \u2013 or they watched \u201cacrid, yellowish smoke creeping across the entire bay\u201d while in its midst thousands of men lost their lives. Looking out over the flat, grey sea, it was hard to imagine it had swallowed so many. Back on the sea front, the Sailor\u2019s Reading Room provided some refuge. Originally intended as a booze-free place for local mariners to while away their hours on land, this maritime retreat remains just as Sebald describes it: \u201cOn the walls hang barometers and navigational instruments, figureheads and models of ships in glass cases and in bottles \u2026 apart from the muffled sound of the sea and the clicking of balls there is nothing to be heard.\u201d (Actually, there was also the loud ticking of a repeater clock, but let\u2019s not split hairs.) It felt like the only things that have changed since he was there are the newspaper headlines. We\u2019ll never know what Sebald would have made of Boris Johnson\u2019s bid to become prime minister, but those headlines did make me think how difficult it would be to write a book like The Rings of Saturn now. To get lost in the past when the present is so rudely screaming for attention. To be a German living in the UK, but have no need to mention it except in passing, because who would care? To walk through the flatlands of Suffolk and barely mention global warming or the startling inequalities between struggling Lowestoft and chi-chi Southwold. Maybe the fact that it now feels like it\u2019s set in a vanished world is entirely fitting for a book so caught up in destruction and whose very last clause describes a glimpse of a landscape \u201cnow being lost for ever\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
