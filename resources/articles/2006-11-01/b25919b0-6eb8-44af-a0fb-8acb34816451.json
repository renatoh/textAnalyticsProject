This week, the country's largest brewer warned that result profits will be hit as a result. But all that smoke may be clouding Scottish and Newcastle's crystal ball gazing. Like-for-like sales at the non-smoking drinking holes already introduced in England and Wales by ubiquitous pub firm JD Wetherspoon have actually risen 12% over the past year. In Scotland - where a national ban is already in force - sales at the 39 Wetherspoon pubs are up 5.2%. Many in the entertainment industry feel a smoking ban is unjustified, saying there is no direct link between passive smoking and lung cancer and heart disease. They hold up as evidence a controversial US study published in the British Medical Journal in 2003, which found no increased risk of death from cardiovascular or pulmonary disease in non-smokers whose spouses smoke. However, last month, research by the University of Dundee found an \"immediate and positive\" impact on the health of bar staff following the introduction of the Scottish smoking ban last March. Researchers found reduced nicotine levels in the blood of bar staff, improved lung function and less inflammation in the bloodstream. The greatest improvement in the quality of life was among those with asthma. And with more than four and a half million people with asthma in England and Wales, we say roll on June 1. Matt Keating Believe it or not, even the boss can be bullied Could you be guilty of bullying your boss? While most of this week's Ban Bullying at Work day focused on workers at the bottom of the ladder, research by the Chartered Management Institute suggests senior managers are victims of bullying, too. Sometimes it's by demanding customers or clients, but a quarter say they have been bullied by their junior staff. Bullying is really about control and, it seems, control knows no rank. The culprits, according to the Chartered Institute of People and Development, are primarily \"gatekeepers\": junior staff who find out what their boss needs to perform his or her job, then wield control by withholding what is needed. Withholding participation or sabotaging the process can damage how a boss is viewed by those higher up, says Gary Namie, co-author of The Bully At Work (Sourcebooks). The gatekeeper bully might ignore a manager's instructions, fail to deliver messages to their boss, make sure papers are not delivered to meetings in time or spread lies about their supervisor. This sounding familiar? The motive for bullying up the ladder might be retaliation against an abusive boss. Or, it might be a long-serving worker wanting to chase away a new boss because they see them as a threat. Of course, every savvy employee knows how to manage their manager. But the line between managing and bullying our boss might be thinner than we thought. Ian Wylie North Sea workers' pay has taken a deep dive Quibbling over a 25% payrise might seem a little ungrateful. But when were you last asked to step into the icy waters of the North Sea and spend eight hours 600ft under the waves? This week, more than 960 North Sea divers were on strike and taking part in a Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union telephone referendum to decide whether to accept the offer from a group of seven employers. \"The danger is ever-present,\" says Derek Moore, one of the striking divers. A welder by trade, Moore has been a diver for more than 30 years, carrying out installation and maintenance work on oil rigs. \"There were no health and safety regulations when I started. Even now you totally rely on the mechanical equipment and support systems to keep you alive. You can be trapped by falling equipment or stuck in strong tides.\" Between 1970 and 2000, 58 divers perished in the North Sea. Divers must also contend with the boredom, cooped up in saturation chambers on support vessels for up to four weeks. The chambers enable the divers to live under pressure so they can undertake multiple dives, at greater depths, over longer periods. But six men (diving is exclusively a male occupation in the North Sea), bunk beds, a toilet, shower and communal table are squeezed into a space no greater than a 5m by 2m shed. Divers are paid a daily rate, which has failed to keep pace with increases in average earnings. The rise tabled by employers should restore parity, but divers will continue to do their jobs without sick pay, paternity pay or contracts of employment. Employers, says Moore, can hire and fire him at a moment's notice. \"All we get is what we call a NRB certificate,\" he says. \"Not required back.\" Ian Wylie \u00b7 We'd love to hear your stories Send your funny, nostalgic or bizarre tales of working life to: Real Work , The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email work@theguardian.com.
