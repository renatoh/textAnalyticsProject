Drafted into the US army, but fortunate enough to escape a tour of duty in Vietnam, he spent the Summer of Love stationed in Germany. Prine arrived back in the US at the end of 1967, just as rock music began to leave psychedelic experiments behind and head earthbound again, which suited him just fine. He was born in 1946 and learned to write songs during the early 60s folk revival by imitating the Carter Family. Eighteen months after he returned to civilian life in Chicago, he saw Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash performing together on the latter\u2019s TV show. \u201cI thought the music I was playing and writing, it\u2019d fit straight in-between the two of \u2019em,\u201d he recalled in 2019. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u2019\u201d Almost uniquely among the glut of early 70s singer-songwriters, Prine \u2013 who has died aged 73 \u2013 seemed untouched by the countercultural events of the preceding years: he seemed to tap into an earlier musical tradition, \u201can authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia\u201d, as critic Robert Christgau noted of Prine\u2019s eponymous 1971 debut album. He was not given to writing starry-eyed paeans to the denizens of the Woodstock festival. His albums never sounded as if they had emerged from the stoned, eucalyptus-scented idyll of Laurel Canyon. There was something tough and austere about them, perhaps because of Prine\u2019s voice \u2013 a rough, artless, nasal rasp that Dylan suggested sounded as if Prine had swallowed a jew\u2019s harp. It got more gravelly as the years progressed and he recovered first from neck, then from lung cancer. Prine wasn\u2019t a musical innovator. He occasionally threw his audience a curveball, not least when he released, in 1979, Pink Cadillac, a rockabilly-infused album filled with slurred vocals and raw-sounding performances \u2013 an amplifier fritzing out was audible throughout the track Saigon. But for the most part, his music stayed within a territory bound on one side by country and folk and on the other by old-fashioned rhythm and blues. Prine was an extraordinarily gifted songwriter. Gruff, funny, empathetic, imaginative, he was a born storyteller. When playing live, his peers might occasionally \u201crap\u201d with the audience, but Prine seemed as much in his element spinning lengthy yarns between songs as singing them. Devotees of his debut album \u2013 or the acclaimed Bruised Orange in 1978, or his 1991 \u201ccomeback\u201d album The Missing Years \u2013 might disagree, but there is a compelling argument that the best way into his work is his 1988 double album John Prine Live. Recorded when Prine had fallen out of fashion and was back playing clubs, it strips everything back to guitar and vocals. Occasionally, the intros last twice as long as the songs. He could write apparently straightforward country hits that, on closer inspection, were never quite as straightforward as they seemed. A US Top 10 success in 1975 for David Allan Coe that Prine co-wrote with Steve Goodman, You Never Even Called Me By My Name, was both a livid assault on the country music industry and a parody of the genre\u2019s cliches: \u201cI was drunk the day my mom got out of prison and I went to pick her up in the rain / But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck, she got runned over by a damned ol\u2019 train\u201d. Prine feared it would so offend the Nashville establishment that he asked for his name to be removed from the credits. He saw himself as someone who wrote about real life and became a protest singer by default: the Peabody Energy company took such exception to Paradise, his 1971 depiction of the effect of mining on his father\u2019s home town in Kentucky, that it printed a pamphlet denying the song\u2019s claims. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Prine protested. \u201cThey made me into a Woody Guthrie character.\u201d Prine could conjure up heartbreaking portraits of drug-addicted Vietnam veterans or divorcees in penury; he could write drily funny accounts of domestic disputes and small-town life, and he could wittily imagine what might have happened to Jesus during the 18 years of his life unaccounted for by the Bible: \u201cHe went to France, he went to Spain / He found love, he found pain / He found stores, so he started to shop / He had no money, so he got in trouble with a cop.\u201d If you didn\u2019t believe the critics, the volume of whose praise usually dwarfed his sales, you could take note of the reverence in which he was held by his peers. He was discovered by Kris Kristofferson, who saw him performing in a deserted club and, after his set, demanded that Prine return to the stage and play it again, along with \u201cany other songs you got\u201d. Prine wasn\u2019t the only artist to labour initially under the \u201cnew Dylan\u201d tag, but he was the only one who could boast such a degree of cheerleading from Dylan himself, who played harmonica on stage with Prine and praised his work as \u201cpure Proustian existentialism \u2013 midwestern mind-trips to the nth degree\u201d. When Prine made a rare attempt to court commercial success with The Missing Years, Pink Floyd\u2019s Roger Waters and orchestral arranger to the stars Michael Kamen each wanted to produce him. The job went to Howie Epstein of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and the stars who got involved included Petty, Phil Everly, Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Springsteen. Then there were the cover versions, by everyone from Cash (who recorded Sam Stone, but declined to sing its most shattering line: \u201cJesus died for nothing, I suppose\u201d) to Bette Midler and Loretta Lynn. If you want evidence of Prine\u2019s influence on subsequent Americana, look at the cast list of the tribute album Broken Hearts and Dirty Windows, which features Lambchop, My Morning Jacket, Conor Oberst and Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon. If you want to know about the spell his work cast over a new generation of left-field country stars, then look at the artists who flocked to collaborate with him in the autumn of his career: Brandi Carlile, Kacey Musgraves, Alison Krauss, Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack. Indeed, the respect afforded him by younger artists helped garner an unexpected Indian summer in his career. The Tree of Forgiveness in 2016 was effectively John Prine doing what John Prine had always done: it was understated, alternately moving and funny, not least When I Get to Heaven, on which he detailed his ambitions for the afterlife, including drinking cocktails, taking up smoking again and settling scores with \u201ca few choice critics \u2026 those syphilitic parasites\u201d. It was the highest-charting album of his career. When the news broke that Prine was in a critical condition with coronavirus, a cross-generational selection of artists began posting covers of his songs online in tribute. Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy sang Illegal Smile; Colin Meloy of the Decemberists sang Angel from Montgomery. Joan Baez, meanwhile, sang Hello in There, Prine\u2019s impossibly moving song about a lonely elderly couple, with its closing plea for companionship and understanding: \u201cIf you\u2019re walking down the street sometime and spot some hollow ancient eyes / Please don\u2019t pass \u2019em by and stare as if you didn\u2019t care, say, \u2018Hello in there, hello.\u2019\u201d The tributes seemed to sum Prine\u2019s career up: a beloved but unassuming genius, who let more famous voices spread the word about him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
