Elsewhere in the Carabao Cup: Bournemouth have beaten Middlesbrough 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium, while Bristol City have put four past Crystal Palace at Ashton Gate - that one finished 4-1 to the Championship side. Leicester City avoided an upset by beating Leeds 3-1 at the King Power Stadium, but Arsenal\u2019s match against Norwich has gone to extra time after finishing one apiece after 90 minutes. At the Etihad, it\u2019s still scoreless between Manchester City and Wolves, with five minutes of normal time to go. You can monitor the scores in the rest of those matches on our live scores service. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over. With a minimum of fuss, Manchester United advance to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup, consigning Swansea City to their fifth defeat in six games. It was a largely dreadful match, lit up by two splendid goals from Jesse Lingard. 90+2 min: Kyle Naughton has a late effort from outside the Manchester United penalty area deflected wide for a corner. The ensuing inswinger breaks to Leroy Fer three or four yards from goal, but Sergio Romero saves his effort brilliantly from point-blank range. 90+1 min: We enter three minutes of added time, with Swansea looking a completely beaten docket. They\u2019ve offered little or nothing tonight and their fans won\u2019t be happy at all with such an insipid performance. They\u2019ve been so quiet. 89 min: Giving an impressive demonstration of \u201cmanspreading\u201d on his seat in the dug-out, Jose Mourinho idly scribbles in a notebook. I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s writing, because I\u2019m struggling to find anything noteworthy going on out on the pitch. 86 min: Anthony Martial is on the far side of the pitch, furthest from the Manchester United technical area, so it\u2019s he who makes way for Luke Shaw ... very slowly. Shaw gets a warm round of applause from Manchester United\u2019s travelling support. 84 min: Arsenal equalise against Norwich at the Emirates, while Luke Shaw is getting ready for a brief cameo off the bench. Jose Mourinho seems determined to humiliate the kid at every opportunity - is it ludicrous to suggest he could have given him longer than a few minutes at the tail end of a League Cup match that\u2019s already been won? 80 min: With 10 minutes to go, Manchester United are two goals up and in almost complete control of this game. Daley Blind sends in a cross from the left flank, but it\u2019s a mite too high for Romelu Lukaku in the penalty area. 77 min: Bournemouth and Leicester have both taken 2-1 leads against Middlesbrough and Leeds respectively, while it\u2019s as you were in the other Carabao Cup matches taking place elsewhere tonight. Back at the rather dreary game I\u2019m actually supposed to be watching, Daley Blind has just been booked for a foul on Wayne Routledge. 76 min: Axel Tuanzebe trips Jordan Ayew just outside the Manchester United penalty area and is booked for his troubles. The free-kick is in a good position, but Jordan Ayew\u2019s effort is on target but feeble and doesn\u2019t trouble Sergio Romero one bit. 74 min: Abraham doesn\u2019t take long to get involved. On the edge of the Manchester United penalty area, he receives a pass in acres of space, adjusts his sights and unleashes a rising shot that Kristoffer Nordfelt is forced to palm over his own crossbar. Nothing comes of the corner. 72 min: Swansea City substitution: Tammy Abraham on for Oliver McBurnie, who goes off to a warm round of applause from the home fans. The Scottish U-21 international hasn\u2019t had too many chances to shine tonight, but did OK, holding the ball up well on the rare occasions it came his way. 70 min: Elsewhere tonight, Bristol City lead Crystal Palace 4-1 at Ashton Gate, while Norwich are a goal to the good against Arsenal at the Emirates. Other latest scores: Bournemouth 1-1 Middlesbrough, Leicester City 1-1 Leeds United, Manchester City 0-0 Wolves. 68 min: Spare a thought for Swansea\u2019s central defence, who have been softened up for almost 70 minutes by the pace of Rashford and now have to contend with Romelu Lukaku fresh off the bench and hungry for goals after failing to score in his past three appearances. 66 min: Manchester United double-substitution: Ander Herrera and Marcus Rashford off, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic on. Swansea substitution: Roque Mesa off after a very disappointing effort, Leroy Fer on. 63 min: Lingard squanders a half-decent chance to complete his hat-trick, getting in behind the Swans defence again and pulling a low effort across the face of goal. He may have intended to do exactly that, but I think it was just a poor shot from a tight angle. 59 min: This match may be a dud, but Jesse Lingard is doing his damnedest to provide some entertainment. He runs on to a Darmian cross from the right and from just inside the Swansea penalty area, stretches to steer a powerful long distance header past Kristoffer Nordfeldt and inside the left upright. He\u2019s delighted with himself and so he should be. 58 min: Jesse Lingard doubles Manchester United\u2019s lead with a wonderful header. That is outstanding. 57 min: Sam Clucas is booked for a cynical challenge on Marcus Rashford, who promptly drills a low ball into the Swansea penalty area. Anthony Martial tries and fails to get on the end of it. 54 min: Manchester United win a free-kick halfway inside their own half. Chris Smalling stands over it. He looks left, he looks right ... he turns on his heel and passes the ball back to Sergio Romero. Heaven help us all. 50 min: Ander Herrera gets a sarcastic roar of approval from the Swansea fans for a wayward shot that sails high and wide from distance. That\u2019s the first noise they\u2019ve made all night ... unless of course the cheer came from Manchester United\u2019s heroically vocal travelling support. 49 min: Matteo Darmian is penalised for a foul on Roque Mesa in the centre-circle and lumbers back into position in a fit of high dudgeon. 48 min: Wayne Routledge looks a mite dazed and very confused after a clash of heads with Daley Blind while contesting a high ball. He should probably be checked by a doctor, but this is football so it goes without saying that he isn\u2019t and just soldiers on with a possible concussion. 46 min: Manchester United get the second half started, with no further changes in personnel on either side after that first-half substitution of Naughton for the hamstrung Olsson. The more I think about it the more it beggars belief that Paul Clement risked his only fit left-back in a game of such little consequence when his side are struggling in the Premier League. And the Guardian\u2019s man on the Swansea beat doesn\u2019t sound too happy. The teams troop off at half-time, with Manchester United\u2019s second string comfortably outplaying their Swansea counterparts in a very dull match. The Jesse Lingard that separates the sides was one of very few moments of class in front of a very subdued crowd in the opening 45 minutes. Swansea\u2019s woes at the Liberty Stadium look set to continue. 44 min: Paul Clement made eight changes going into this game and probably wishes he\u2019d made nine. Martin Olsson, who has gone off with a hamstring injury, is his only specialist left-back and will, presumably, be unavailable for at least three weeks if not longer. Perhaps he should have taken Luke Shaw on loan from Manchester United - Jose Mourinho certainly seem to have any intention of using him. 41 min: After spluttering briefly into life and looking like it might shape up to be a decent game after all, the game enters another lengthy lull. Making his second appearance for Manchester United in this season\u2019s competition, Scott McTominey runs on to an Anthony Martial, but commits the rookie error of leaning back while shooting and sending the ball high over the bar from the edge of the penalty area. 38 min: Swansea substitution: Martin Olsson off, Kyle Naughton on. 37 min: Swansea left-back Martin Olsson looks like he\u2019s done his hamstring, pulling up sharply and feeling the back of his thigh. He\u2019ll be going off as soon as the ball goes out of play. 34 min: Having just seen a replay of Manchester United\u2019s goal, I must confess that I didn\u2019t give Marcus Rashford enough credit for his assist. Standing with his back to goal, the little back-heel with which he picked out Lingard the goal-scorer was a think of exquisite delight. 33 min: Swansea have a penalty shout of sorts turned down when Tuanzebe appears to hold back Routledge while tracking the Swansea man\u2019s run into the Manchester United penalty area. I think a free-kick just outside the penalty area might have been the correct call there. 30 min: Ki sends in a cross from the left and Daley Blind heads the ball against Oliver McBurnie and looks on in horror as the deflection heads goalwards. Luckily for blind, it flashes just wide of the upright. That would have been a very strange own goal, had the ball gone in. 27 min: After his Huddersfield horror show, Victor Lindelof has looked anything but assured and he fails to convince again, twice, as Wayne Routledge pounces on a through-ball from an offside position. The Swansea man should probably have been flagged for offside, but the linesman failed to spare the Swede\u2019s blushes as he stretched but failed to reach Routledge. Mourinho and all several Manchester United defenders rage at the referee. 25 min: United win a free-kick in the space between the left-side of the Swansea penalty area and the touchline. Rashford drives the ball in low and hard, aiming for goal. It\u2019s cleared at the near post. 23 min: Manchester United have been crying out for somebody to provide an incisive , defence-splitting killer pass and Ander Herrera steps up. He carves open the Swansea defence with a ball through the middle. Marcus Rashford got a flick, sending Lingard in behind one on one with Nordfeldt. He made no mistake, coolly passing the ball in by the right upright. 21 min: Jesse Lingard opens the scoring after being put through on goal, slotting the ball past Kristofer Nordfeldt into the bottom right-hand corner. A good goal and a nice finish. 18 min: Manchester United win a corner. Marcus Rashford\u2019s delivery is poor and Angel Rangel clears at the near post. 16 min: Jordan Ayew continues to look a bit of a handful, but even after just 15 minutes this match already looks well on its way to the One To Forget files. Even Jose Mourinho looks bored, although he has just bounded to the edge of his technical area to bark some instructions at Ander Herrera. 14 min: A mistake from Victor Lindelof almost lets Jordan Ayew wriggle his way between a couple of defenders and unleash a shot. He eventually runs out of space and Sergio Romero collects. 11 min: Swansea City apply a bit of pressure, getting forward in numbers. From the left touchline, Martin Olsson sends in a cross. Jordan Ayew gets his head to the ball ahead of Axel Tuanzebe, but is unable to get any control or direction on his effort. 10 min: Manchester United continue to dominate possession but are showing little or no cutting edge in these early stages. They advance, but only so far, before invariably turning around and retreating with the ball. 8 min: Ki Sung-Yeung arrows the ball into the penalty area from the corner flag and Oliver McBurnie, wearing the Swansea No68 shirt, attempts to steer a header goalwards. The ball takes a deflection off a defender on its way wide, but the referee mistakenly awards a goal-kick. 7 min: Matteo Darmian concedes a corner as he blocks an attempted Martin Olsson cross from the left. 7 min: Angel Rangel and Wayne Routledge combine down the right flank and the latter tries to send in a cross from near the corner flag. Daley Blind blocks. 5 min: Swansea City goalkeeper Kristoffer Nordfedt tips a Jesse Lingard shot from distance over his own crossbar. Daley Blind takes the corner and Swansea\u2019s defence clears the ball. 3 min: There looks to be a good crowd at the Liberty Stadium, but the atmosphere seems a bit flat in these early stages. Manchester United go forward, with Anthony Martial and Daley Blind combining down the left flank before they are forced backwards. 2 min: Sam Clucas concedes the first corner of the match, running the ball out of play while attempting to clear his lines. The ball\u2019s fired into the penalty area, where Chris Smalling leads highest and puts a near post downwards header wide from about eight yards out. 1 min: Swansea City get the ball rolling and Manchester United quickly win a throw-in. It\u2019s windy and wet in Swansea as the two teams make their way out on to the pitch and line up for the last of the pre-match formalities. Just the 15 changes across both sides, with Pal Clement making eight and his opposite number, Jose Mourinho, making seven. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened with Roque Mesa?\u201d he asks. \u201cLauded as a smart acquisition, he\u2019s barely had a look in in a struggling team.\u201d The Spanish midfielder signed from Las Palmas for \u00a311m during the summer and has made just three starts. \u201cSome people have questioned why he is not in the team,\u201d said Paul Clement, suggesting that Phillip Wainright may have sent him an email too. \u201cHe is still getting up to speed with things, he has been training hard, he is ready for a start.\u201d Swansea: Nordfeldt, Rangel, van der Hoorn, Mawson, Olsson, Ki, Roque, Clucas, Routledge, Ayew, McBurnie. Subs: Fer, Abraham, Narsingh, Mulder, Naughton, Fernandez, Fulton. Man Utd: Romero, Darmian, Lindelof, Smalling, Blind, Tuanzebe, Ander Herrera, Lingard, McTominay, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Jones, Mata, Lukaku, Mkhitaryan, Shaw, Matic, Joel Pereira. Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire) Swansea City: Nordfeldt; Rangel, van der Hoorn, Mawson, Olsson; Mesa, Ki, Clucas; Routledge, Ayew, McBurnie. Manchester United: Romero; Darmian, Smalling, Lindelof, Blind; Tuanzebe, Herrera, McTominay; Lingard, Martial, Rashford. We\u2019ll bring you the benches, shortly, but it looks a certainty that Luke Shaw will be sitting on Manchester United\u2019s, as he travelled with the team this morning. He\u2019s made just one appearance for Manchester United so far this season and the world\u2019s most expensive teenager now looks to be Jose Mourinho\u2019s fifth choice left-back. Surely his failure to get into tonight\u2019s starting line-up will be a humiliation and snub too far for a player who has made several appearances for United\u2019s U23s this season, once out of position. The Carabao Cup fifth-round draw will be streamed exclusively live on Twitter, the English Football League has announced. The draw will take place at 4pm on Thursday, October 26 and it will be the first time such an event for a major English football competition is broadcast solely on the social media platform. \u201cThe proceedings will be hosted by TalkSPORT commentator Sam Matterface, who will be joined by British sporting royalty Phil Tufnell and Matt Dawson,\u201d read an EFL statement. The draw will be held at Twitter\u2019s UK headquarters in central London and the quarter-final fixtures will take place during the week commencing December 18, with the final scheduled for Wembley on February 25. Sergio Romero, Victor Lindelof, Axel Tuanzebe and Scott McTominay all start for Manchester United. Paul Clement makes eight changhes to the Swansea side that was beaten by Leicester at the weekend. Kristoffer Nordfeldt, Oliver McBurnie and Roque Mesa are among the starters there. We\u2019ll have the full line-ups for you very shortly. Both teams are looking to bounce back from Premier League defeats at the weekend, but neither is likely to be at anywhere near full strength as Jose Mourinho and Paul Clement rest established stars and give fringe players a chance to impress. Despite his howler against Huddersfield on Saturday after coming on for the injured the injured Phil Jones, Victor Lindelof is likely to line up for Manchester United, although there has been speculation that Alex Tuanzebe in place of the Swede. Luke Shaw, Scott McTominay, Sergio Romero, Matteo Darmian and Daley Blind are also understood to have been in the United party that flew \u2013 flew! - to Swansea from Manchester this morning. Swansea will be without Renato Sanches, Wilfried Bony and Kyle Bartley, who are all sidelined with injury. Clement is also planning to rest goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. The Swansea manager has also said he will start Roque Mesa for only the fourth time since the midfielder\u2019s move from Las Palmas. Barry will be here soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
