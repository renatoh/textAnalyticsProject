That policy will leave kids even worse off!\" His milder-mannered antagonist, who had been outlining some ideas for changing the policy on the exclusion of children from state schools, retorted with a staccato barrage of statistics. The argument raged for some time, drawing the whole table into animated discussion. The duellists were a Conservative front-bencher and a senior adviser. Similar heated debates are taking place wherever thinking Tories gather. While key operators such as Francis Maude and Nick Boles work on implementation plans, the entire Conservative party is engaged in a high-energy debate about policy. For those with long memories, it feels like 1996, only then the energy was on the Labour side. These arguments matter to anybody with an interest in progressive politics because the winners will be dictating policy after the next election if \u2013 oh, lets drop the pretence \u2013 when the Conservatives win. The arguments that matter are those between the small but powerful band of progressive Tories and the old guard. The \"Prog Cons\" have seized control of the party. Whether they can make it do their bidding is the biggest political question of the next five years. This time last year, team Cameron engaged in a concerted campaign to seize the \"progressive\" label. In a series of articles and speeches, the Conservatives claimed that progressive ends such as fairness and equality were now best met by \"Conservative means\". At the time, these means were unclear, but a year on we have a slightly better idea. The original motif of progressive Conservatism was to focus on social issues rather than the economy. In an attempt to rid the Tories of the label of the \"economics party\", the Cameroons emphasised the \"social recession\" and \"broken Britain\" and promised to fix society as Mrs Thatcher had fixed the economy. Well-being, quality of life, social value, work-life balance: these were the tasting notes of the new Tory brew. That was then. Now the Conservatives will inherit a bloody fiscal situation, an economy struggling out of recessionary gloom and a shattered financial system. Being the economics party is now a prerequisite. \"The challenge for us now is to find an approach to the economy which helps us achieve our social objectives too,\" says a senior insider. Some of the elements are in place: better consumer protection in financial services and institutional reforms to hold the Treasury to account. The state of the public finances has been a blessing, giving Cameron some political cover to back off the regressive, if initially popular, pledge to raise the ceiling on inheritance tax to \u00a31m. Ironically, this was the move that caused Brown to decide against an election that he may have won. In this sense, the election-winning policy will have been one that is never enacted. The Tories are understandably keen to keep many of their economic plans under wraps. But as their poll lead hardens, the bond markets are now putting them under the microscope. More detail will have to come soon. There is, for example, a pressing need to hear more on the plans to extend asset ownership and, in Cameron's phrase, to \"recapitalise\" the poor. A green paper is planned; this needs to spell out in detail how they plan to encourage employee ownership and boost savings for those on low income. This paper is also likely to unveil plans to turn assets such as parks, libraries and leisure centres \u2013 owned by the state \u2013 over to the community. The rhetoric of the \"post-bureaucratic age\" never really took off, not least because it's a phrase almost as ugly as Brown and Balls' famous \"post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory\". But if it means anything, it must mean the creation of a post-bureaucratic state. If old Labour was about giving power to workers over the means of production, new Conservatism is partly about giving citizens control over the means of government. More broadly, the depth of the fiscal hole is genuinely worrying the Tories. There is a danger, as Philip Hammond discovered, of appearing to be too keen on wielding the axe. But only the most rabidly right wing are actually glad of what one senior Conservative describes as an \"existential crisis\" in the public finances. There are some innovative ideas being floated for the way to handle the internal politics of cutting spending. There will be a long cuts cabinet to agree the broad shape of government expenditure and the Tories are likely to run this before any ministerial appointments are made. This means that the cabinet will be able to agree cuts to certain departments \u2013 behind a \"veil of ignorance\", if you like \u2013 without this being portrayed by the media as a defeat for the cabinet minister in question. There are other ideas to try and prevent the diseases of departmentalitis and Whitehall tribalism which wreaked such havoc in Labour's first years. All cabinet ministers may have offices in the Cabinet Office. A civil service reform bill will be near the top of the agenda. The civil service neutered Blair for years and the Tories are determined to hit the mandarins hard and early. Given the need to cut spending, but also the commitment to progressive ends, the Conservatives will have to create a smaller, but more redistributive state \u2013 and Labour has already pushed spending in a more redistributive direction. One of the tests that will be applied to decisions about spending is distributional impact. This leads to some uncomfortable areas. There are signals already that middle-class welfare will be attacked. Middle-income tax credits, child benefit and higher education (still a middle-class gravy train) will all be examined. Whether Cameron has the courage to touch middle England's state-funded perks, which Brown, for all his books on the subject, did not, remains to be seen. But there is a steely tone to conversations in this area, which make it seem likely. \"We are very clear about this,\" says an aide. \"The middle classes will have to pay their fair share.\" This kind of determination will be necessary if Cameron's austerity is to be progressive austerity, which protects the poor and the environment. The commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on international aid is a sign that there is a global dimension at work, although it is still pitifully low. The commitment to ring fence NHS spending is important from a redistributive point of view, since health spending, even if riddled with inefficiencies, is strongly pro-poor. Above all, the Conservatives have a progressive trump card in the shape of their education policy, which could smash the middle-class opportunity hoarding made possible by high house prices in the catchment areas of the best schools. The Conservative plans to let money follow the pupil to the school of their parents' choice and, crucially, to add a pupil premium to the poorest children. A Labour cabinet minister said to me five years ago: \"If the Conservatives ever go for a vouchers system weighted in favour of the poor, we're in real trouble\". They have \u2013 and they are. But the pupil premium will be an early test of Cameron's progressive credentials. Once his backbenchers and the right-wing leader writers wake up to the fact that the taxes of \"hard-working families\" are going to be used to give an advantage in the education market to the children of the \"feckless, idle poor\", all hell will break loose. This is why strategists know the policy has to be pushed through fast, during the honeymoon. The level of the premium is also crucial and here the Conservatives are being too coy, for fear of frightening their own horses. (A smart Labour leader would pledge to support the premium, but it remains to be seen how smart Brown's successor will be.) Another litmus test is the ambition of a planned localism bill. We'll see then if the Conservatives are serious about the \"radical redistribution of power\" Cameron promises. Localism as a political agenda is like an outdoor plant: it dies in the stuffy rooms of Whitehall. The most utopian talk about an attack on the asymmetries of power that blight British society; some are even picking up the idea of equality of capabilities, drawn from the philosophy of Amartya Sen, pursued by James Purnell and Liam Byrne. Likewise, the \"vote blue, go green\" promises, easy to make in the pre-recessionary era, will be quickly put to the test. Burying the third runway at Heathrow will be a significant symbol, but the Tories will have to push through Labour's quiet radicalism on carbon pricing and carbon budgets. The progressive Conservative vehicle is still on the road, albeit badly dented by the need for recessionary economics. Glaring old Toryisms remain \u2013 most obviously in the proposal to financially reward marriage \u2013 and there is a huge challenge to be progressive and prudent with a ballooning deficit. There are many areas of policy where the slate is still too blank to form a judgment. But while the prospect of a Conservative government was once a chilling one to any progressive, there is now the possibility that Cameron, supported by his small band of cutlery-rattling progressives, really has changed his party, as Peel, Disraeli and Thatcher did before him. We'll know soon enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
