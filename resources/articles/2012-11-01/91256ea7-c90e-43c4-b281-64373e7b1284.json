Whether racked up at the petrol pump or laid out in a bill on the doormat, they are perhaps the readiest reckoner Britons have for determining the rising cost of living. And make no mistake, energy prices have been rising: according to calculations by the price comparison website uSwitch, the average energy bill has gone from \u00a3522 at the start of 2004 to \u00a31,309 last week, 98% above the rate of inflation. No wonder Ed Miliband has put energy prices at the heart of his strategy as Labour leader. No wonder David Cameron launched into the subject at prime minister's questions last month. And no wonder that his energy secretary, Ed Davey, has laid out plans to reduce gas and electricity bills. The first thing that should be said about Mr Davey's proposals is that they should provide some relief for cash-strapped customers. The second is that they are not quite what the prime minister ordered. And the third is that they leave the basic problems of the retail energy market unresolved. First, then, the ovation. There are 1,756 energy tariffs on the market at the moment. Some of those least able to afford big energy bills are on the costliest rates. All in all, there is a level of complexity so great as to indicate industrial deviousness. What the energy secretary proposes is to limit suppliers to offering only four tariffs for gas and four for electricity. British Gas and its rivals will have to make their quotations clearly so that customers can readily compare them. That is not the avowal made by Mr Cameron last month, that suppliers would be legally mandated to put customers on the lowest possible rate. But that proposal was hastily made and ill-thought-out; Mr Davey's offer should mean a big improvement for many Britons. Academic studies show that, whether in jam or in higher education, consumers neither want nor can handle too much complexity. Simplification should enable customers to make better choices. But all Mr Davey is proposing is a change in billing, not pricing. And he is certainly not proposing to change the mechanics that place 85% of the retail market in the hands of the big six suppliers, and which mean that when one raises prices the rest follow soon afterwards. If it looks like an oligopoly, and acts like an oligopoly, then it probably is an oligopoly. Making its workings simpler is of limited use. Yet that seems to be the main objective of both the government's plan and Labour's proposal for more transparency in the wholesale trading market and a stronger regulator. More extreme measures are needed: either opening the market up to more competition by breaking up the big six, or taking the industry back into public ownership (where, arguably, it more naturally belongs). The halfway houses that Westminster is offering will help, but only a little."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
