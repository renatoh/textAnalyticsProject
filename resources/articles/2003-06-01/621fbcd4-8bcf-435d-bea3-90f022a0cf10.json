But there was plenty of life in the further reaches of Worthy farm on this beautiful Saturday afternoon. Up in the circus and theatre fields, two muscular-looking kangaroos wearing flying goggles, on stilts, were posing for photographs. On the circus stage, a man was being wrapped in 40 metres of cling film. He instructed his assistant to cover his head, and then poke a hole for his mouth. \"I'm serious about the hole, mate,\" he said, beginning to sweat. In something close to the birth scene in Alien, Mr Cling Film duly emerged from his plastic wrapping in just under a minute, to huge applause. Large queues dissuaded me from learning basic trapeze skills, and instead I ate a Caribbean curry, washed down with cider (when in Somerset...). As the sun begins to set, anticipation builds over the evening's Pyramid Stage line-up: Supergrass, Flaming Lips and their troupe of furry animals, and the headline act, Radiohead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
