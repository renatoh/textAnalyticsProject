The palm of the hand not only reveals your hang-ups but also what sort of character you have, and it's this that determines your destiny. I became hooked on this whole area after going to see an eccentric old lady who read my palm and told me that I was going to fall in love, only for my partner to die in a horrible accident. I was only 17 at the time and found the experience rather traumatic - I suppose I felt that there had to be a better way. She taught me how to do it, and encouraged me to start reading as many palms as I could get my hands on. When I do a reading I look at every part of the hand - not just the position of the lines on it but also its shape, and the position and thickness of the fingers. Finger print patterns, and even the way a person holds their hands, all reveal intimate things about them and what they have been through. I've become the \"palmist to the stars\" almost by accident. I started doing them by post, which enabled me to keep my age a secret (who would go to a teenager) and it grew from there. I did it all through my media degree at college and it simply took over. The majority of people come to me because they want to know more about their relationships, or are seeking advice. My first professional reading in public was, rather bizarrely, at the Stringfellows nightclub where I was put up on a pedestal, under a strobe light and next to a huge bottle of champagne. One man came up but didn't say a word throughout the reading. I told him that he had experienced a tragic event at the age of 21 and that a business partner was about to sell him down the river. It's always rather unnerving when clients don't speak, but as he left he told me his brother had drowned. I saw him six months later and he told me his work associate had done the dirty on him and he had lost everything. Today clients come from all over the world, and I've even been asked by directors to confirm their choice of star for a show they are putting on. I've really got into writing about it and have either written or edited 12 books - my latest has just been published. I try to keep the sessions light in tone and use a lot of humour. If I see trouble ahead I simply advise caution - none of my clients come out feeling traumatised. milesbrignall@blueyonder.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
