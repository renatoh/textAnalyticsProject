This should happen at a stage when such discussions can inform key decisions and before polarised positions appear. Indeed, the two academies are holding a free public debate, which will explore the benefits and uncertainties of the development of nanotechnologies highlighted by our study, at the Royal Society on September 29 (see www.nanotec.org.uk) Our report provides wide-ranging recommendations and we expect the government to consider them fully and carry out its own commitment to respond by the end of the year. Prof Ann Dowling Chair, Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering working group on nanotechnologies At ITDG we were consulted by the Royal Society working party. Our concern is that yet another new technology will over-promise and underdeliver; that in addition to the already apparent \"digital divide\", we may be on the verge of a \"nanodivide\". We should ensure that nanotechnologies are harnessed for the benefit of all peoples in the world not just those who can afford to fuel a consumer boom of new products. Many poor people in the world have basic requirements - for water, energy, and food - that are as yet unfulfilled. We need to ensure that nanotechnologies are used to achieve wider social and environmental goals (eg sustainable energy), rather than meeting short-term or developed world \"market opportunities\" for products such as sunscreen.
