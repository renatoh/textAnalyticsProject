The location was correct, but there remained some doubt about how accurate the tip-off was. As soon as they burst in, they got the answer they wanted: there, bound but unharmed, they found Norman Kember and his fellow hostages, Canadians James Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden. After 118 days in captivity, their ordeal was over. Their kidnappers, however, were missing. \"We are assuming they buggered off out the back when they heard the soldiers coming,\" said one intelligence source. When news of the successful rescue operation broke back home, it came completely out of the blue. Since the men were snatched in Baghdad on November 26 while working for Christian Peacemaker Teams, there had been few communications from the kidnappers and hopes for their release had slowly faded. Two weeks ago, their fellow captive, Tom Fox, a 52-year-old American, was found murdered, intensifying fears that it was only a matter of time before the other three were killed. But it is now known that yesterday's military operation, involving Iraqi troops and US and Canadian special forces as well as the SAS, was merely the culmination of months of surveillance and undercover work, all conducted far from the media spotlight. Dubbed a \"rolling operation\" by John Reid, it involved British intelligence officers, diplomats and military based inside Baghdad's green zone. In the aftermath of the kidnapping, the strategy was to box in the kidnappers by encouraging prominent Muslims in Britain and the Middle East, some of them radical, to urge the gang not to murder avowed peace activists in the name of Islam. The British team hoped this would make at least buy some time by making them think twice about killing the hostages In a tandem operation, other members of the team in Baghdad sifted information, some of it trivial, some of it fantasy, a few snippets genuine. \"An awful lot of intelligence work was involved,\" an official said. For the first three months they had little success. Then, in the last few weeks, their luck changed. On the hostage video, the kidnappers claimed to be from a previously unknown group called the Sword of Truth. But intelligence officers had identified them as members of a Sunni insurgency group, either Jaish al-Mujahideen or al-Jabha al-Islamiya. From intelligence information, they were able to begin making arrests of suspects. The major breakthrough came on Wednesday night, according to US Major General Rick Lynch. Coalition forces picked up two people, one of whom \"knew where the hostages were and provided that information\". What he did not say is that the two detainees are also suspected of being members of the kidnap gang. It was at this point that the SAS team went into action. Backed with logistical support from US and Iraqi forces, they moved into position around the house. British officials yesterday would only give the location as western Baghdad, but the Iraqi interior ministry was more specific, saying it was in the sprawling rural outskirts of the city, between Abu Ghraib and Mishahda, about 20 miles from the city centre. Military sources say that although they had credible intelligence information, the operation remained extremely risky. \"It all depends on the nature of the tip-off and how reliable it is, whether you have got the right place. But it wasn't as though a dozen doors were kicked in first,\" said a security source in Baghdad. By 8am local time - 5am in London - it was all over. In the end, no force was required: British defence officials, confirming last night that the SAS had led the operation, said no shots had been fired. The three hostages were flown by US Black Hawk helicopter back into the safety of the Green Zone, where they underwent a gentle debriefing yesterday. A more detailed debriefing was planned for later in the day. After four months in custody, the Foreign Office was hopeful that he would have information that could help them locate members of the kidnap group still at large and \"other nasties\". The result was greeted with jubilation not just by the men's families but by coalition officials. Few hostages pictured on video in orange suits, in imitation of the Guantanamo inmates, survive. The three were also were known to be held not by a gang seeking ransom money but an Islamist group demanding the release of all Iraqi prisoners, an impossible demand for the British to meet. The kidnappers demonstrated their ruthlessness two weeks ago when they shot dead Mr Fox, and dumped him by a roadside in Baghdad. The hostage team was not panicked by the death of Mr Fox. Although his murder cast gloom on the team, a postmortem showed he had not been executed. This fact - not publicly divulged at the time - eliminated the initial fear that Mr Fox had been killed in a symbolic gesture because he was American or as a warning to the US and British governments that the other hostages would soon be killed also, if the kidnappers' conditions were not met. \"Something happened, maybe an escape attempt or a scuffle of some kind that resulted in his death,\" the security source said. He ruled out speculation that Mr Fox's killing might have been the result of an earlier rescue effort which went wrong. \"There was no other rescue attempt before today,\" he said. There were expressions of relief yesterday from Tony Blair to the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and the defence secretary, John Reid. But when Mr Kember was first taken, there was dismay within the British government at what officials saw as recklessness in operating as part of Christian Peacemaker Teams in Baghdad's Red Zone . The Reverend Alan Betteridge, a friend of Mr Kember's for more than 40 years, voiced those unspoken fears yesterday when he told BBC Five Live: \"It's tremendously good and so unexpected after the killing of Tom Fox a couple of weeks ago, when we really did fear that each one would be killed eventually.\" Mr Straw was told of the release while attending a cabinet meeting in Downing Street and rushed off to inform Mr Kember's wife Pat. But she already knew: the local paper had already alerted her. The British embassy in Baghdad last night gave Mr Kember the option of returning home quickly - by helicopter from the Green Zone and onwards by plane - or having a further 24 hours for reflection. Backstory A devout Christian and lifelong pacifist, Norman Kember felt he needed to do more than march through London to protest against the war in Iraq. So last November, the 74-year-old retired professor of medical physics travelled to Iraq as a \"gesture of solidarity\" with a group of Christian peacemakers. For Mr Kember, a trustee of the anti-war Fellowship for Reconciliation, it was a chance to assess the impact of the occupation on ordinary Iraqis. \"I've done a lot of writing and talking about peacemaking,\" he said at the time. \"I've demonstrated ... but I feel that's what I'd call cheap peacemaking.\" He admitted there were risks to his trip, and so it proved on November 26, when he and three fellow activists were abducted in Baghdad. Video threats warned they would be executed if Iraqi prisoners were not released. Footage also showed the captives calling for troops to be withdrawn from Iraq. His wife Pat, also a committed Christian, issued several appeals, calling her husband a good man interested only in fighting injustice who had travelled to Iraq to help. Yesterday, her prayers were answered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
