The militants, including a vicar's son and a psychiatric nurse, led what they called a \"holocaust\" against a farm which bred guinea pigs for medical research. Jon Ablewhite, John Smith and Kerry Whitburn pursued a six-year hate campaign against Darley Oaks farm in Newchurch, Staffordshire. Whitburn's girlfriend, Josephine Mayo, was sentenced to four years for a lesser part in the campaign. Almost 100 people connected to the farm were targeted. Explosive devices were sent to some, mail threatening to kill and maim to others. There were attacks on homes, cars and businesses. The relentless campaign culminated in the theft of the body of Gladys Hammond, a close relative of the Hall family who ran the farm, from her grave in October 2004. For months, activists taunted the Halls, telling them the body would be returned if they closed the farm. The body was found only last week in woodland after Smith told the authorities where it was. Sentencing the men, Judge Michael Pert described them as wicked and a danger to society. He said: \"You assumed the right to dictate which lawful activities you would permit and which you would not. You sought to enforce your views not by lawful protest but by subjecting wholly innocent citizens to a campaign of terror.\" Police welcomed the sentence. Detective Chief Inspector Nick Baker, who led the inquiry, said: \"I hope the sentence sends a strong message to those tempted to engage in such extremism. Your cowardly tactics will not be tolerated. You will be caught and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\" The four pleaded guilty to conspiracy to blackmail - the first time such a charge has been used successfully against animal rights extremists. At yesterday's sentencing hearing, Anthony Glass QC, prosecuting, described a \"prolonged and vicious attack\" against the Hall family, their relatives, friends and contacts. It began in 1999, when members of the protest group Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs began to turn up at the Halls' farm with placards comparing their operation to a Nazi concentration camp. In September 1999, more than 600 guinea pigs were \"liberated\" in a raid. The activists conducted painstaking research - helped by a mole at the DVLA - to trace anyone connected with the family and terrorise them. They threatened a cleaner who worked for them, leaving fake explosive devices outside her home and throwing paint bombs through her windows. They wrote threatening to attack her unless she stopped working for the Halls. \"We're tooled up and ready, are you?\" they wrote in one letter. The extremists left a doll with a knife in its chest and pins in its head outside the house of a farm labourer and spelled out his name in shotgun cartridges. Some of the hate mail was signed the Animal Liberation Front, others the Animal Rights Militia. The extremists turned their attention to a business that collected milk from the Halls' dairy herd and, after searching the bins of one of its executives, found he had an embarrassing medical condition and published details on a website. The fanatics threatened a family firm that supplied the Halls, and vowed to go after other members of the female darts team to which one of the bosses belonged. But the most outrageous incident was stealing Mrs Hammond's body from the churchyard at Yoxall, Staffordshire, in October 2004. The activists wrote to the Halls telling them they could get the body back if they shut the farm. \"This is a serious offer,\" they wrote. The blackmailers ensured the Halls knew they had the body by mentioning a toy left in the coffin. In March 2005, Staffordshire police appeared on the BBC's Crimewatch programme asking the authors of anonymous letters sent to the Halls to prove they had the body. As soon as the programme ended, Smith drove Ablewhite and Whitburn to Brakenhurst Wood, close to Darley Oaks farm. Police were tailing them. They stopped them early in the morning and found a collapsible spade, head torch, balaclava and camouflage clothing in the car. On a mobile phone at Smith's home, they found a text message sent that morning. It read: \"Flies hoverin [sic], cld be a while\". Police raided the homes of Ablewhite, 36, Smith, 39, Whitburn, 36, and Mayo, 38, in the West Midlands and Manchester. They found mobile phone and computer records which proved their part in the campaign. Darley Oaks farm was forced to shut in January. Christopher Hall, one of the principal owners, said his family had felt \"under siege\" for years. Mrs Hammond's daughter, Janet Palmer, told the court the theft of her mother's body was a \"gruesome and alien thing to do\", an act of \"terrorism\".
