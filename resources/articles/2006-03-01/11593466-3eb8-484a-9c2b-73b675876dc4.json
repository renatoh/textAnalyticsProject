The government is considering an appeal against district judge Leonie Brinkema's decision on Tuesday to bar testimony from aviation officials, who were central to the justice department's case. Judge Brinkema issued the sanctions because a government lawyer violated trial rules by coaching witnesses on their testimony and giving them access to trial transcripts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
