You can bet they really mean tax cuts. \"Simplification\" is new Tory code for cuts, as George Osborne yesterday promised \"a radical overhaul of the tax system with a programme of tax simplification at its core\". It's not in the least surprising. He is the man who flirts with flat tax, the simplest tax of all - but also the most regressive, taking the least from the wealthiest. \"At long last, Osborne is talking tax cuts,\" a joyous Daily Mail headline welcomed his first revealing speech about his tax plans. He said: \"I am clear. We need to move towards lower taxes,\" because \"personal freedom and responsibility are diminished as the state takes a larger slice of everyone's cake\". But he won't promise tax cuts upfront: \"We fought the last three elections on that promise and lost all three of them!\" He reminds Tories greedy for cuts that Thatcher and Howe in 1979 promised only \"a programme of tax reform\". He is stealing New Labour's two-year tax-and-spend freeze pledge in reverse: stealth worked for them. While David Cameron is dainty as a butterfly flitting from likable issue to issue, George Osborne is the one to watch. He takes less care to hide his instincts (and is starting to worry some in his own party with his weakness on economics). His speech began with that rousing old battle cry: \"This Saturday - June 3 - we celebrate Tax Freedom Day. That is the point in the year when people stop working for the chancellor and start earning for themselves.\" This tellingly spurious factoid hints at his numerical fragility. Who exactly are the \"people\" who stop working for the state on June 3? Only the very, very rich, of course - the Notting Hill people. It can't be calculated exactly, since you can't apportion to individuals such things as corporation tax, nor individual VAT spending habits. But to get some idea why this \"tax freedom day\" only applies to the rich, consider first that a third of adults pay no income tax anyway. Only 11% pay tax at the higher rate, and less than 1% earn \u00a3100,000 or more. His \"tax freedom day\" takes little account of tax credits, which change most families' tax profile. In fact, only 10% of families, those earning over \u00a358,000, are not eligible for any credits. So the show-stopping June 3 date is bunk (though not for Cameron or Osborne personally). Bear all that in mind as we plunge into the prickly thickets of tax credits that have been so gleefully attacked by the Tories and their press this week. Yes, credits are quite complicated because they do something subtle and difficult - and mostly do it rather well. They deliver more money to more families, with a higher take-up, better adapted to families' changing circumstances. A typical single mother working part time gets nearly \u00a34,000 more than under the old family credit others want to return to. So wrap a wet towel round your head and follow me. First the bad news. These facts are true: some 2 million families were overpaid \u00a31.8bn in credits last year. Nearly a million familes were underpaid \u00a3556m. Clawing it back is painful for the relatively few owing large sums - though half owe under \u00a3500 and a third owe less than \u00a3200. A new system allowing people to keep much of it will cut this by a third this year. That means 20% will still be overpaid and 10% will still be underpaid. How bad is that? Not all that bad. The standard error rate of the social security system for means-tested benefits under all governments has always been around 10%. But most of these over- and underpayments are not errors. The whole point of the system is to make sure families can keep on an even keel when their incomes change. Overpayment happens if they fail to declare when their household incomes rise, when earning more, moving in with an earning partner or stopping childcare, or when a child reaches 18. Families are underpaid if they fail to claim when their income drops or they have another child. Most people report income changes: this system gets much closer to the frequent changes in family lives. The trade-off is that when earnings alter, some people will always find themselves over- or underpaid. Take-up of tax credits has been better than any other means-tested system ever, reaching well over 80% of the eligible and 93% of poorest. Last election the Tories wanted to go back to the cheaper, far less generous family credit, for which fewer qualified - and only 65% of those who did qualify claimed it. Research finds that people feel less stigma about claiming tax credits than benefits, because 90% of families are eligible. The Lib Dems want to \"simplify\" by having a fixed date twice a year for assessments - but that would leave many more families desperate if their income drops. Simple, yes; fair, no. And it encourages gross fraud. When people can declare a low income for one week and know they won't have to declare again for six months, they can deliberately earn very little for that week and reap unearned rewards for half a year. Yes, they are quite complicated but, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, tax credits have delivered \"the longest sustained fall in child poverty since records began\" - 700,000 fewer children now live below the poverty line, back to levels of 20 years ago, (though not yet repairing all the damage done in the Thatcher years). \"Simplifications\" would deliver less. On the doorstep at the election, families talked of their tax credits: hearing Tory plans to abolish them did Labour a lot of good. As most families get them, credits have won support right up into middle England. Labour pollsters found them vital, and Tories should do serious polling before they consider cutting or \"simplifying\" them. Yet, for reasons that are puzzling, Labour still fails to make its popular family policies its main battleground with the Tories. Why are tax credits for children and universal high-quality children's centres not the party's key winning symbols? Make a year's paid maternity, and more paternity leave, the red line between the parties: Cameron says he doesn't want regulation, just nebulous \"culture change\". Help for children should be the reason why women will vote Labour again. However, not only Tories are attacking tax credits. What were Stephen Byers and Alan Milburn doing in the budget debate criticising \"complexity\"? What was MP Gisela Stuart doing writing in the hostile Telegraph, of all places, that Labour is taxing and spending too much? (Maybe her Edgbaston party doesn't read the Telegraph?) Her partner, Derek Scott, a rightwing former economic adviser to Tony Blair, wrote an almost identical denunciation of Brown's tax-and-spend in the Financial Times this week. It is to be hoped that they are just a pair of embittered mavericks. If they are a more sinister sign of inner party rumblings against Gordon Brown, then Labour people undermining Labour's own economic reputation to settle petty squabbles will prove lethal. It is to be hoped these voices are not speaking for the dangerous people who really don't much care any more as they have nothing to lose: after Blair, let it all collapse. Never forget that it's the poorest drawing tax credits who will be the real losers. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
