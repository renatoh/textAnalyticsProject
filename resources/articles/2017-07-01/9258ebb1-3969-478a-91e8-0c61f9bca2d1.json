In 1991, a Cornelia Parker installation, Cold Dark Matter, saw the artist hang pieces of a detonated garden shed from the ceiling. \u201cIt was absolutely the most exciting thing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d she recalled. Twenty-four years later, she re-opened the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester with the work forming a cornerstone of a new Parker exhibition. But it is owned by the Tate, of course. Balshaw took over the top job \u2013 overseeing all four Tate galleries \u2013 last month, replacing Sir Nicholas Serota. After 29 years in the job, he\u2019s credited with not only turning Tate into one of the world\u2019s most successful art brands, but also for radically changing the British public\u2019s relationship with culture, ushering in an unexpected (and at times tempestuous) love affair with contemporary art. But while Balshaw may not be looking to blast the place apart \u2013 why would she since it does too much too well to reasonably crave that \u2013 the 47-year-old is nonetheless already shaking things up. Her appointment breaks new ground in and of itself: she\u2019s the first female director in Tate\u2019s 120-year history, and has cheerfully described herself as a \u201cfeisty northern woman\u201d. She was certainly seen as dynamite in her previous role: appointed in 2006, Balshaw revitalised the Whitworth \u2013 fundraising for a \u00a315m, hugely successful redevelopment, as well as parlaying that job into a dual role \u2013 and she also ran the more traditional Manchester Art Gallery from 2011. At the same time, she was director of culture for Manchester city council, helping persuade then chancellor George Osborne to fund a new arts venue, The Factory, to the tune of \u00a378m. Balshaw has been a northern powerhouse in her own right. But that indefatigable ambition is delivered with a cheerfully no-nonsense attitude that has made her a popular figure in Manchester and the arts world. Where Serota had a reputation for a certain cool steeliness, Balshaw is known for her warmth and energy. Parker has described her as \u201cvery dynamic, charismatic and persuasive\u2026 She\u2019s very enthusiastic. She\u2019s very inclusive.\u201d Balshaw has said that she looks forward \u201cto developing Tate\u2019s reputation as the most artistically adventurous and culturally inclusive gallery in the world\u201d. Still, inclusivity was surely also key to Serota\u2019s revitalising of Tate over the past three decades: the opening of Tate Modern in 2000 helped make visiting galleries a mainstream activity, with the hugely popular Turbine Hall installations becoming a beacon for how Brits embraced the institution. It now receives 5.8 million visitors a year, with Tate Britain attracting 1.1 million. Balshaw thinks they need to go further; art, in Britain, is not yet for everyone. \u201cWe can afford more ambitious targets,\u201d she told the Financial Times. Those in her sights? Young people. Non-white audiences. Less well-educated, less affluent audiences. \u201cWe have a long way to go to reach people who might not think any of the art is for them.\u201d She added: \u201cWe used to think museums were irrelevant to 16- to 26-year-olds, but you have to be open at different times of day \u2013 then they come.\u201d Assume the Tate late events are safe, then. And Balshaw has got form when it comes to young people. After a career in academia, her first arts job in 2002 was as director of Creative Partnerships, a government campaign to inspire creativity in schools. She introduced a Whitworth Young Contemporaries curating scheme for under-25s; when the judges for Museum of the Year visited the gallery in 2015, a youth-led event \u2013 including a local grime act \u2013 was scheduled. Going ahead was a risk but, she recounted in an interview with Creative Review, they decided \u201cfuck it, it\u2019s the right thing to do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The Whitworth won. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than a toddler\u2019s or a teenager\u2019s view on whatever particularly difficult work problem you\u2019re wrestling with,\u201d she told the Observer last year. And Balshaw has no shortage of youthful views: she and her husband, Nick Merriman, director of Manchester Museum, have four teenage children between them. The world-view of a new generation seems set to shape her vision for the Tate as much as any reverence for art history. \u201cYoung people today have a sophisticated grasp of identity, its fluidity, how it is culturally defined, [not as] post-structuralist theory but as lived reality,\u201d she told the FT. Still, Balshaw is herself steeped in theory: she took an MA in critical theory at the University of Sussex, followed by a doctorate in African American visual and literary culture. With Balshaw at the helm, visitors can expect a curatorial twist towards global and identity politics, with storytelling and sociological shows \u2013 such as the recent Queer British Art show \u2013 alongside blockbuster exhibitions of great white males. She\u2019s boldly unabashed in declaring that there needs to be fewer of the latter, suggesting there\u2019s been an overdominance of white European work at the Tate. And expect to see more neglected international female artists too \u2013 something the institution has already begun to address, with shows of artists such as Mira Schendel, Sonia Delaunay and Fahrelnissa Zeid. An avowed feminist \u2013 obviously \u2013 Balshaw delivers her radical intent with a certain breeziness, casually mentioning she is aiming for total gender parity. \u201cI don\u2019t strive for shows 50 per cent by women because that\u2019s a feminist gesture, but because we want to refer to the world we live in,\u201d she explains. She very visibly championed female artists during her time at the Whitworth, with shows by Parker, Elizabeth Price and Marina Abramovic (with whom she reportedly bonded over a shared love of fashion). \u201cIf there are great female artists out there who aren\u2019t getting the profile or exhibition space they should, she will fight their corner,\u201d John McGrath, director of the Manchester International Festival, said. Some will no doubt accuse Balshaw of diversity box-ticking. But widening out the stories the Tate tells is one way to attempt to attract the wider audience she craves. It\u2019s also surely a pressing concern at a time when, to some, the country feels bitterly divided between young and old, north and south, haves and have-nots. Balshaw is a canny appointment in such a climate. She has less of the whiff of the metropolitan cultural elite than your average cultural figurehead. Born in Birmingham, she attended an unexceptional comprehensive in Northamptonshire. Her degree is from Liverpool, not Oxbridge, and her career has been in the Midlands and north; she can\u2019t be accused of being part of the London bubble, at least. And Balshaw has already proved to be a nimble operator in politically troubled times. One of the victims of the Grenfell Tower tragedy was a young artist, Khadija Saye. When the Sunday Times art critic Waldemar Januszczak tweeted Balshaw to suggest the Tate should show her work, she promised to put one of the 24-year-old\u2019s works on display the following week \u2013 proof that even megalithic institutions can move rapidly to reflect the nation\u2019s mood. She\u2019s a confidently outward-facing figure: she tweets everything from a defence of Ariana Grande to a take-down of Nigel Farage, and Instagrams wonky selfies of her beloved bright, bold dresses as well as art openings. You can\u2019t quite imagine Serota sharing a snap of himself making a late-night cheese toastie at the Venice Biennale\u2026 Unlike her predecessor, Balshaw isn\u2019t from a curatorial background \u2013 raising eyebrows among some in the art world, who fear her knowledge may not be up to snuff, although seen as a positive by others. Last summer, Balshaw told the Observer: \u201cIf I feel a bit sick at the thought of an idea, a bit \u2018oooh, God, this is scary\u2019 \u2026 that feeling in the gut makes me realise that, yes, this is a challenging and therefore sensible thing to do.\u201d Fear can be a useful spur, it seems. THE BALSHAW FILE Born Maria Jane Balshaw in Birmingham, 24 January 1970, and grew up in Northampton and Leicester. Studied English at Liverpool University and Critical Theory at Sussex. Married to Manchester Museum director Nick Merriman. They have four children between them. Best of times Making history as the first woman director of the Tate. Worst of times Not many professionally - she\u2019s thought to have applied to be director of the British Museum in 2015, a post which went to Hartwig Fischer. What she says \u201cI\u2019m also a profoundly physical person. I have my best ideas in the 30 minutes following my almost daily yoga session.\u201d What they say \u201cTo define herself as a leader she needs to establish herself not as a cultish follower \u2014 there have been too many who have buckled under the pressure of Sir Nicholas\u2019s firm thumb \u2014 but as someone with the fresh ideas and creative vision to take the organisation into the future. She is clearly possessed of both.\u201d Rachel Campbell-Johnston, art critic, the Times"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
