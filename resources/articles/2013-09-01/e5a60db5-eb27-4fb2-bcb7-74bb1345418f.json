Leicestershire police said the fire, which caused the deaths of a woman and her three children, was being treated as suspicious. Shehnila Taufiq, who was in her 40s, died when her home was engulfed in flames, along with her 19-year-old daughter and sons, aged 17 and 15, who were named by the local mosque as Zainab, Jamal and Bilal. Emergency crews battled to save the family but the four victims were found dead inside the bedrooms of the terraced house in the Spinney Hill area of Leicester in the early hours of . Taufiq's husband, named as Mohammad Taufiq Sattar, was believed to be returning home from Ireland where he works as a surgeon, a friend said. Assistant Chief Constable Roger Bannister said police were investigating possible links between the blaze and the stabbing, including the possibility that the fire may have been a revenge attack. \"The relatively close proximity and the timing involved would lead us to believe that they may be linked,\" he said. \"Our inquiries are ongoing to establish exactly what happened.\" On Friday night three people, a 19 year-old man and two women, both 19 were arrested in connection with the stabbing. Police and firefighters were called to the terraced property at 12.35am . The previous evening, at about 5.30pm, a man in his 20s was stabbed in Kent Street, half a mile from the property. He was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary where he died. Bannister said two murder investigations had been launched into the \"terrible, terrible crimes\". Asked during a press conference whether revenge could have played a role in the incidents, he said: \"That may well form one line of inquiry. At the present time, I cannot confirm that, it may be, it may not be.\" The couple who lived in the house are believed to have come from Pakistan and their children were born in the UK. Neither the family or the stabbed man were known to police. Bannister appealed for calm. \"I really do understand the level of concern there may be in the city, but I invite people to speak to extra officers on patrol or telephone the police,\" he said. A Leicestershire police spokesman said: \"The fire, which caused extensive damage to the property, was extinguished by the fire service and the property has been cordoned off to allow for a full forensic examination. The circumstances and cause of the fire are currently under investigation and officers would ask anyone who has any information regarding the incident to please contact them.\" Several neighbours of the family voiced fears that they had been mistakenly targeted in a revenge attack meant for someone else. A middle-aged man, who was woken by the sound of neighbours attempting to alert the family, said the heat of the fire was so intense it could be felt on the opposite pavement. The witness, who asked not be named, praised the bravery of two men who tried to make their way into the property. \"I didn't know the family personally but I knew of them and they were a very nice family,\" the man said. \"Most people feel this was meant for somebody else and they got the wrong house.\" He said: \"I was in bed at about midnight and I heard all the commotion and thought it was drunks or whatever, and then I heard shouting. \"The guy opposite broke the door down but the fire was so intense they couldn't get in. They were throwing bricks at the windows at the top of the house to alert them inside but I think it was too late. \"The fire was very intense and you could feel the heat of it across the road. The neighbours tried their level best but it was too severe.\" Mr Taufiq was a consultant neurosurgeon and had been working in Beaumont hospital in Dublin and at the Blackrock and Hermitage private clinics. \"The board and staff of Beaumont hospital have learned, with shock, of the tragic loss suffered by our colleague Mr Taufiq Sattar,\" a spokesman said. \"We wish to express our sincere condolences to Mr Sattar and assure him that our support and thoughts are with him at this terrible time.\" Colleagues at the clinics said: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sattar at this most difficult time.\" The family attended the Jame mosque in Asfordby Street, about 100 yards away from their home. Shehnila, Zainab and Bilal were enrolled on its educational programme. A spokesman for the mosque said: \"The members of our mosque, the staff and all of our colleagues are extremely shocked and are praying for them. \"We would also like to send our condolences to the father, Dr Taufiq, who as you can imagine, would be going through a difficult time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
