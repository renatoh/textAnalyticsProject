A sold-out Academy Stadium meant \u201cthe atmosphere was brilliant,\u201d said Neville. \u201cEvery time we got into the final third there was a real buzz, they\u2019ve got the new kit on and there was a real feelgood factor. I said to the players we shouldn\u2019t lose that.\u201d The England manager was insistent that this defeat, their second in a row at home, was not as serious a blip as the 2-0 loss to Sweden at the end of 2018, and in fact reassured him of the team\u2019s confidence in his plans. \u201cAgainst Sweden I think we deviated from the plan \u2013 at two goals down in the first half I thought that happened. Tonight they stuck to the plan and that gives me confidence that they believe in my philosophy.\u201d The Canadians offered a more physical challenge than Spain will on Tuesday night, and this game was a vital part of the World Cup preparations for that reason. \u201cI thought it was a brilliant game in terms of the test we wanted,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThey had experience, we knew they were going to change to two or three formations and we knew that to play the type of football that we want to play we had to be really brave. I saw a team that tried to be brave. Our composure in the final third let us down, particularly in the second half.\u201d Lucy Bronze was shifted from her usual right-back berth into the middle to sit in front of the defence alongside Keira Walsh, a position she was playing in for the second time under Neville, before being moved back halfway through the second half. Neville said he would continue to test his Lyon star positionally. \u201cI\u2019ll use her in both, you look at the second half, the amount of headers that she won and the way she drove forward. It\u2019s the second time she\u2019s played midfield in her life, let alone her career.\u201d Rachel Daly, filling in for Bronze on the right of the defence was, like Neville, bullish about the performance. \u201cI think we were really good. You just can\u2019t shut off, they got a goal at a crucial time and you\u2019ve just got to keep going and try and get one back. We\u2019re at a good point right now, we\u2019ve got a good team chemistry on and off the pitch and the score doesn\u2019t reflect the performance tonight by any means.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
