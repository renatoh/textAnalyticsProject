At one stroke its decision has breathed new life into the protocol, which was widely regarded as being effectively in a coma since 2001. And by choosing to announce its decision this week, Russia's government has - unwittingly - put pressure on the developed world's two high-profile Kyoto refuseniks, the United States and Australia, which both happen to be in the middle of bitter election campaigns. The Bush administration pulled the US out of participation in the Kyoto agreement in 2001, a precursor of the unilateralism that the US would exhibit on other issues. John Howard's government in Australia has long objected to the treaty. Both countries' involvement in Iraq has overshadowed other international questions, but Russia's move now puts Kyoto in the spotlight. By staying out, the US and Australia will be unable to benefit from the valuable economic resources created under the protocol. Russia is responsible for 17% of the industrialised world's carbon emissions, making it an important participant. By signing up to the treaty, Russia is able to join in with the trading structure set up under Kyoto. It can sell its surplus of carbon credits allowed under the treaty on the global emissions market now getting under way in London, a key plank in the Kyoto scheme to put a price on carbon emissions and use market mechanisms to reward countries which reduce them. While the scheme has its weaknesses, it is at least an attempt to do something tangible to cap the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Both the US and Australia will be locked out of the trading system until they sign up to Kyoto - with Australia, in particular, likely to lose out on investment as a result. The opposition Labor party in Australia and the Democrats in the US both support approval of Kyoto. In both close-run elections the environment could yet play a part - thanks to the Kremlin's change of heart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
