All seems very bleak. And \"back office\" types at the prestigious Aldgate Union building in London would barely know how to cope were it not for the cheering news that, at the same time as getting rid of them, their bosses are applying for an alcohol and entertainment licence. It will clear the way for late-night refreshments, live music, recorded music and dancing. So the dole queue beckons. That's unavoidable. But the leaving parties, they'll be fab. \u2022 Bags packed, train tickets at the ready, and it's off to Liverpool for all the politicos. But delegates, hacks and others heading towards the Liberal Democrats' first in-power conference for 65 years should beware. Now they are a real party of government, the traditionally laughable security arrangements have been tightened \u2013 to the point where this week party officials were briefed and warned that there will be \"no more sneaking in the back entrance\". They have been sneaking in that way since Lloyd George was flogging peerages. It's not easy coping with change. \u2022 Ahead of the Lib Dems' gathering, some advice for the party from Roy Hattersley, enjoying the limelight at the launch of his book on Lloyd George, The Great Outsider. Coalition is easier to enter than exit, warned Roy, and the trouble is that in these arrangements, the minority party has to continually demonstrate its loyalty. \"It's like one of those New York gangs. In order to become a member you have to kill a friend.\" \u2022 Meanwhile, why did West Midlands police ban the Right to Work protest from raising its voice outside the forthcoming Tory party conference? Was there a fear that Alastair Campbell would attend? Fielded by Camden Labour in a charity soccer match against a team from the Camden New Journal the other day, Campbell scored twice, perhaps thrice. But the paper suggests that he did not play throughout with the Corinthian spirit. Indeed, one photo posted on the web appears to show our Ali cynically shoving an opponent in the back. Behaviour like that can so easily inflame. \u2022 But he was always pushy. In his own way, so was Tony. And we see that Blair's bestselling memoir A Journey was not just half price in the UK but was also being peddled for half price the other day on a pavement stall on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The seller, a colourful local figure who specialises in bargain deals, had listed it as fiction. At least he didn't move it to the crime section, as happened here. \u2022 And as rumours abound about who has been hacked by News International and who hasn't, there is at least the silver lining that people are becoming more and more careful about how they use their voicemail. Many a titbit to be gained from BBC director general Mark Thompson, in theory. But in practice the effort would be a waste of time, because Thompson refuses to use his voicemail. His theory is that, with voicemail, staff could leave messages and then, when trouble strikes, insist that they had at all times kept him in the loop. The Jonathan Ross farrago highlighted the danger. So anyone who wants to get in touch with Thompson has to keep on ringing or send him a text. He is a careful man being careful. Any frustration this might cause at Wapping is merely a bonus. \u2022 Finally, it was the day of days. The arrival of the pontiff. And the day of the official publication by Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins of The Man in the White Suit \u2013 the book Mark Thompson tried to ban \u2013 the autobiography of the Stig. Great rejoicing, then, and none were excluded, for devotees of Murdoch's Times were also able to read a bit about the \"Lawyer of the week\", Robin Shaw, whose triumph here was that he acted for HarperCollins against the hated corporation. When Rupert's happy, everyone's allowed to smile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
