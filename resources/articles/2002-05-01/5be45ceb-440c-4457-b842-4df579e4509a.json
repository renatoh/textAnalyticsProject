A handful of people were arrested following minor skirmishes with police during the annual protest, which drew thousands of people onto the capital's streets and around the country, but there was no repeat of the more ugly scenes of recent years. Police described the demonstrations as \"peaceful and good humoured\". Up to 6,000 people gathered in Trafalgar Square in a joint rally - including the trade unionists and anti-globalisation groups - and listened to speeches from a variety of activists. Scotland Yard said that by early evening the crowds at Trafalgar Square were dispersing and that approximately 500 people remained. By early evening, there had been eight arrests. After around 4pm the mood had darkened in Piccadilly, central London, as a crowd marched down Coventry Street, where there were angry skirmishes. A hardcore of some 100 demonstrators charged the police line, throwing cans and bottles and shouting \"police scum\". The earlier, generally affable atmosphere appeared to change after two protesters mounted scaffolding and police attempted to get them from their 8ft perch. Wombles charge at police Crowds cheered as a man punched a telephone kiosk, shattering glass and triggering several copycat attacks. Men in white paper suits, believed to be part of the Womble group, later charged through police lines towards Trafalgar Square. Earlier, a large group headed away from Trafalgar Square and were blocked by police outside Centre Point on Tottenham Court Road. A fracas ensued with pushing and shoving between protesters and police, who raised their batons but eventually allowed the group to pass. The demonstrations were more fragmented than recent years; organisers had advised people to \"keep moving\" after police successfully corralled large numbers of protesters on Oxford Street last year. Cordons came down in Soho, where a group was demonstrating for sex workers' rights, as police attempted to recreate the corralling tactic. However, flashpoints flared wherever protesters met riot lines and several in Dean Street threw missiles at police and at a nearby McDonald's. TUC and Globalise Resistance Earlier, at Trafalgar Square, TUC members and Globalise Resistance, the first of the protest groups to stage a demonstration with a trade union, joined with other groups and individuals at a May Day rally. Among the speakers was former Labour MP Tony Benn, who told the crowd he had learnt one lesson during his long life in politics: \"If you want to do anything. You have to do it yourself.\" He urged people to organise, support trade unions and \"get up off their knees\" and build the world they wanted to live in. Mick Connolly, the TUC south-east region secretary, said: \"I think things are going well, as expected, a peaceful assembly with more of a carnival atmosphere than perhaps we normally have.\" The first protesters into central London were cyclists on a Critical Mass demonstration starting at Camberwell, south London, and ending at Hyde Park. Protest at US embassy A small protest was held outside the US embassy. Environmentalists joined the cyclists in calling for Washington to support the Kyoto agreement on global warming. At one side of the square demonstrators held a banner reading: \"Capitalism Doesn't Work So Let's Replace It\". Police said the protest in Grosvenor Square passed without any problems and some of the cyclists shared jokes with officers. But the prime minister, Tony Blair, urged the protesters to abandon the streets for the ballot box and vote in tomorrow's local elections. \"If you have got something to say, say it democratically tomorrow,\" he told BBC London radio. \"Come out and vote, but don't end up trying to beat the place up because your politics aren't the politics shared by the vast majority of people.\" The Metropolitan police's assistant commissioner, Mike Todd, said a group of approximately 1,000 people including \"known troublemakers\" were playing \"cat and mouse\" with police. They were moving around the West End, breaking off into groups of about 100 and running down side streets to test police resources, he said. The home secretary, David Blunkett, said the police had his \"absolute support\" in clamping down on people intent on anti-social behaviour. \"I would hope everyone today behaves themselves, but if people step out of line the police will have my full backing in doing what is necessary to ensure law and order is maintained,\" he said. The TUC and Globalise Resistance march began in Clerkenwell Green, central London, an area with a history of radicalism where Lenin once printed a Russian-language newspaper. Ellen Luby, an 80-year-old veteran of May Day marches, said she had turned out for the sake of the young people who she claimed were not getting enough help from the government. \"I am concerned about the young people's country today, privatisation and students in thousands of pounds of debt trying to study. But I always came out to support anything to do with the workers fighting for their rights,\" she said. Anti-fur protests Anti-fur campaigners earlier lined up outside three shops in central London, shouted at the sales staff and in two cases hurled water bombs, once at a worker in a fur shop off Regent Street and once at a McDonald's restaurant on Oxford Street. Outside Noble Furs on New Burlington Place the group yelled \"shame\" and \"ban the fur trade\" and heckled staff looking down on them from a first floor window. One protester shouted: \"You filthy animal abuser. How would you like to be skinned alive?\" Anna Smith, an actress from Redbridge, east London, said: \"We're here because there's no excuse for trading in fur. It's a cruel trade.\" The London protest is just one of many events around the globe. May Day protesters in Sydney seeking rights for asylum seekers today clashed with riot police, resulting in dozens of arrests. Police in France are braced for massive May Day demonstrations against the far-right presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen - and some supporting his National Front party - amid fears that the two sides may clash in Paris. Anti-capitalist demonstrators also gathered in Glasgow for a protest starting in Buchanan Street. Around 300 demonstrators gathered outside the City Chambers in George Square where they unfurled anti-capitalist and anti-war banners amid a carnival atmosphere. Protesters danced to music being blasted from the back of a van while others beat on home-made drums and blew whistles. Strathclyde Police said no arrests had been made by 1pm and described the procession as \"good-natured and peaceful\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
