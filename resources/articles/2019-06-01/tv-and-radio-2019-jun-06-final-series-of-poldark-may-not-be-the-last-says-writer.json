Writer Debbie Horsfield, who adapted the bestselling Winston Graham novels for the BBC, said there is a possibility the Cornish show could come back in future as there are still five books of the 12-part series left to cover. Asked after a screening of the first episode of the final run if she would write more Poldark episodes in the future, Horsfield said: \u201cNever say never. We\u2019ve had an amazing run but there are five books left and who knows what could happen in a few years\u2019 time?\u201d She said \u201csometimes it\u2019s good to leave people wanting more\u201d but agreed that the \u201cdoor had been left open\u201d for more of the adventures of the Poldark family. However, any decision about the drama\u2019s return would be down to the BBC and makers Mammoth Screen. \u201cThe BBC would need to say that they wanted more and we\u2019d take it from there. The relationship with the Winston Graham estate and with the BBC has been wonderful \u2013 I like to think they wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to do it.\u201d Poldark has been a phenomenon for the BBC, made household names of its stars Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson and prompted an unprecedented interest in scything following Turner\u2019s bare-chested wielding of one of the farming tools. The books were adapted before, in the 1970s, and this latest incarnation has shown the enduring popularity of the Graham books. One of the difficulties of a Poldark comeback, Horsfield acknowledged, would be getting the cast and crew back together. She is writing a new adaptation of a contemporary novel and some of the actors, such as Tomlinson, have gone on to star in Hollywood films. Ellise Chappell, who got her big break playing one of the younger characters, Morwenna, and recently appeared in acclaimed Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis film Yesterday, said it \u201cwould be great\u201d if Poldark returned in future. The final series, which airs in July, is billed as one of the must-see TV shows of the year, with Ross Poldark and his foe, George Warleggan, dealing with the aftermath of the death of George\u2019s wife, Elizabeth. In series five Horsfield has bridged the gap between novels seven and eight by, in consultation with the Graham estate, piecing together what happened in the intervening decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
