Up to three wirelessly connected HGVs will travel in convoy, with acceleration, braking and steering controlled by the lead vehicle, a concept named platooning. Each lorry will have a driver in the cab ready to retake control at any time. The government is providing \u00a38.1m in funding for trials of the technology. The Department for Transport (DfT) and Highways England have yet to confirm where the first tests will be carried out, but said they were expected on major roads by the end of 2018. Proponents say platooning could cut both congestion and the cost of fuel for hauliers, although motoring organisations have voiced concerns about safety, particularly on motorways. The DfT said the technology could have major benefits, with vehicles in the slipstream using less fuel, lowering emissions and improving air quality. The transport minister Paul Maynard said: \u201cWe are investing in technology that will improve people\u2019s lives. \u201cAdvances such as lorry platooning could benefit businesses through cheaper fuel bills and other road users thanks to lower emissions and less congestion. \u201cBut first we must make sure the technology is safe and works well on our roads, and that\u2019s why we are investing in these trials.\u201d An earlier attempt to launch tests in the UK, heralded in 2016\u2019s spring budget, stalled after a fruitless search for a HGV manufacturer to participate. The platooning trial will be conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), which has been involved in other tests of driverless vehicles, including passenger shuttles in Greenwich and autonomous delivery pods for online shopping. The chief executive of TRL, Rob Wallis, said: \u201cThe UK has an unprecedented opportunity to lead the world in trialling connected vehicle platoons in a real-world environment.\u201d Similar trials have been successfully carried out in the US and Europe. An EU challenge in 2016 saw platoons of connected trucks travelling from Germany, Sweden and Belgium converge in Rotterdam. However, motoring organisations fear platoons could obscure signs and exits on Britain\u2019s crowded roads, particularly since the hard shoulders on converted \u201csmart\u201d motorways are now being used for regular traffic. The president of the AA, Edmund King, said the government had listened to their concerns and decided against a planned pilot scheme on the M6. \u201cWe all want to promote fuel efficiency and reduced congestion but we are not yet convinced that lorry platooning on UK motorways is the way to go about it,\u201d King said. \u201cWe have some of the busiest motorways in Europe with many more exits and entries. Platooning may work on the miles of deserted freeways in Arizona or Nevada but this is not America. \u201cA platoon of just three HGVs can obscure road signs from drivers in the outside lanes and potentially make access to entries or exits difficult for other drivers. Even a three-truck platoon is longer than half a Premier League football pitch.\u201d The Road Haulage Association said it would be following the trials very carefully. Its chief executive, Richard Burnett, said: \u201cOf course we welcome improvements to the way the road freight industry works and we understand the benefits that such a mode of operation would bring. \u201cHowever, currently the focus seems to be on the technology behind the system. Safety has to come first and it cannot be compromised. It is crucial that this element of the concept gets the highest priority.\u201d Highways England suggested platooning could make journeys safer. Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief executive, said: \u201cInvesting in this research shows we care about those using our roads, the economy and the environment, and safety will be integral as we take forward this work with TRL.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
