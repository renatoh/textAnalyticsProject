England went in for sandwiches on 99-2, so it's a mere matter of making those other 285. I'd also like to thank the couple of gents who emailed me to express their all too real horror at seeing a [cue choking] female providing over-by-over coverage yesterday, and wish them a painless transition out of the 19th century some time soon. 24th over: England 103-2 Trescothick 49 Vaughan 44 Trescothick takes a boundary by walloping it back past Cairns to bring up the 100, and Tania Ward wants to know how to get out of doing any hard graft this afternoon. Click here and get putting, for my money. 25th over: England 110-2 Vaughan cracks one high over square leg for six and his 50 off Franklin. I'd love to say I play cricket, Philip Thompson, but like my friend Harper, I'm a kindly soul - I just help sick children participate. 26th over: England 110-2 \"Someone got sent to prison yesterday for phoning in a bomb warning to avoid having to work an extra shift (in KFC),\" says John McClure. \"Tell Tania to try that one.\" While Tania's getting a voice disguiser ready, Trescothick's busy doing not too much this over. 27th over: England 111-2 Ah, chaps, you've restored my faith in humanity. While Ben Jarman is gleefully imagining our 19th century friends engulfed in flames demanding a male firefighter's rescue, Mark Bermingham is offering me a weekend with him. But I'll be here [shameless plug time] providing minute by minute coverage of Euro 2004. No rest for the wicked. 28th over: England 115-2 Trescothick brings up his half century off 90 balls with a couple of singles. 29th over: England 128-2 Trescothick rolls one through mid off for four, then Vaughan finds the rope just where third man should have been, if only they'd bothered with one. WICKET! Vaughan 61 lbw b Cairns Shortly after sending one up over the infield for four, Vaughan can't find an answer to the slow leg ball from Cairns. Thorpe'll be in next. 29th over: England 136-3 Trescothick thumps a corker through mid off with perfect timing to finish off the over. 30th over: England 140-3 Another boundary as a New Zealand fielder skids face first into the rope in an attempt to catch Thorpe's wallop through the gully. Benjamin Hendy meanwhile, will be spending his afternoon cursing a computer more keen on crashing then serving its purpose, while Shehzad Charania is planning on a prune fest - thus encouraging perfectly timed stomach pains. Hmm. WICKET! Trescothick 63 c Styris b Franklin Trescothick sends one into the slips, but it's too high and it's an easy catch for Styris. Flintoff's walking in. 32nd over: England 141-4 And before you ask where the 31st over was, nothing happened, don't worry. Not that much has been going on in this one, either. Tristan Haley-Burrows is too busy wondering what I look like, mind you, to care. \"I suspect that rather like legendary pot maker Grayson Perry, who had a cross-dressing alter-ego \"Claire\", you are none other than Lawrence Booth with an alice band, a pair of suspenders and a machine gun.\" Rumbled. Although I've got a few pounds to go before I can pull off Lawro's look. 33rd over: England 149-4 Two great boundaries courtesy of Graham Thorpe, slamming the first through mid off before tucking one behind as Fleming pulls a grimace. 34th over: England 157-4 Flintoff 9 Thorpe 12 Flintoff hits a corker off only his 9th delivery to send it away through mid on to the rope, then batters the advertising hoardings with a pull through leg. He's playing like a man who's been at the crease for a couple of hours. 35th over: England 159-4 Good job it was a quiet one, I was off getting a picture of a hedgehog for Gabriel Munns. Sorry, the porcupine was a no go. 36th over: England 160-4 Flintoff 9 Thorpe 14 Still nothing doing, things have slowed down to, well, hedgehog pace to be honest. Channel 4 have even wheeled out Simon Hughes to talk about moisture in the pitch. 37th over: England 161-4 England have got to start feeling they can take this now, especially as New Zealand are lacking Vettori's bite. But Franklin's working the ball well, so I'll try not the completely swallow my size 6s. Julie Allen says she's spending her Friday afternoon frantically trying to delete a huge work-related balls up. I'd say she's probably not alone. 38th over: England 169-4 Why Jeremy Bullock knows hedgehogs have the loudest sniff in nature I don't even want to ask, but he wants us all to know, anyway. Meanwhile, in more pressing matters, Flintoff finds the boundary twice, the second a belting off drive which has Fleming screwing his face up again. And Carlton Pezaro - multi-talented I may be, but I haven't yet managed to keep this up and work on my knitting pattern at the same time. 40th over: England 171-4 A measly single in the last over, and another from Flintoff in this. Oh, James Wilson, sadly it wasn't me that posted 33 in the golf game. 38's my pathetic best. 41st over: England 177-4 Franklin gives way to Jacob Oram, only for Flintoff to roll his wrists and flick one away past the covers. Everyone sending me disturbing emails about the possibility of a picture of some Oxford rower being me, a) stop, and b) no it's not. You'd be bitterly disappointed if you saw the real thing, I swear to you. 42nd over: England 182-4 Thorpe slides one through the gully for a single, but more importantly, self-confessed geek Charles Howard says he's made 28 on the mini-putting game. Actually, what's more important is Flintoff's superb shot evading the sprawling men at both extra cover and mid off. 43rd over: England 183-4 Thorpe 17 Flintoff 26 Tom McGrenery has informed me that pigeons are the only birds that can suck, according to his friend Paul. If I was a bloke, I'd probably be reaching for a punchline involving Jodie Marsh. But I'm not. In the Test, meanwhile, Thorpe's just survived an lbw call. 44th over: England 187-4 A superb boundary from Freddie as New Zealand helplessly call catch to the two stranded gully men. Not a chance, though. Flintoff's hit 30 now, by the way. \"I think some of the readership might find it enlightening to know that if pigeons are fed baking soda, they explode,\" says Paul Birrell. By jove. Learn, something, every day, etc. 45th over: England 188-4 Thorpe nicks a single to square leg in an otherwise uneventful over. 46th over: England 192-4 A four for Thorpe through extra cover nudges England a bit closer to the 200 mark. Gareth Whitmarsh wants to know exactly what the theme is here this afternoon, and frankly, so do I. My inbox looks like the reject pile at the Random Ideas factory. Take your pick between neaderthal men, strange animal facts, or whiling away your Friday afternoon. Or not, it is nearly time to go anyway. 47th over: England 196-4 Freddie nicks one through that third man gap to notch up another four, prompting Nicholas Stone to call him lazy for making most of his runs this afternoon off of boundaries. Nicholas, he can do it for the next three days if it gets us there. 48th over: England 197-4 Thorpe 23 Flintoff 34 Just a single for Thorpe as minds, I suspect, start to turn towards a hot bath and a nice cuppa. 49th over: England 197-4 Whitmarsh is back and he votes Neanderthal man, but Amy Jackson wants to talk exploding pigeons. Simon Stone, meanwhile, reckons Nicholas could be the uncle that walked out on his auntie about 15 years ago. We're going to get stuck in the middle of something if we're not careful here, readers. 50th over: England 202-4 Cairns is giving everything he's got to dismissing Flintoff, but Freddie finds a nice off drive for four to bring up the 200. The man is composure personified thus far today. Nicolas Stone update: James Seadon now believes him to be his French teacher. Will we ever know? 51st over: England 207-4 Flintoff worries everyone with a dink that almost finds itself in McCullum's clutches, but panic not, didn't make it. Another corker through the covers from Freddie keeps the score heading up a decent rate. Eddie Kerridge has discovered Blast Billiards, and I suggest everyone else does the same. It's hypnotising stuff. 52nd over: England 211-4 Flintoff 48 Thorpe 23 New Zealand are gapped again as that missing third man costs them another four runs before the men in suits rush on with the covers. I think they're just doing it to keep me at work late... the players aren't budging. 53rd over: England 217-4 The rain, all three drops of it, has stopped, so we're back for a few overs yet. And they're gapped again!! Freddie finds that sweet spot again and he's reach his 50. Cheers all round in Nottingham. And we can breathe easy again, because Nicholas Stone is not anyone's French teacher. \"Certainly not,\" he says, \"I teach rich Chinese kids English in Beijing.\" No word on that auntie situation though. 54th over: England 221-4 A beautiful cover drive from Thorpe for four more. He's up to 27 now, you know. Tim Davies, staying late at work just to read this, I salute you. WICKET! Flintoff 54 lbw b Cairns Cairns started the over with intent and it only took a couple of deliveries for him to get his man. Not much Freddie could do about it, but England, now 221-5, are looking shaky. 55th over: England 221-5 Hoggard walks on, and he's not looking too pleased about it. Jeremy Bullock's after 250 before close, but by my reckoning we've only got three overs left and the run rate doesn't promise it. 56th over: England 222-5 The new man immediately takes a single, but it's not the most riveting over. But David Keech is after a positive theme. Which is as unlikely as a long-lasting Lopez marriage. 57th over: England 224-5 Hoggard 0 Thorpe 29 \"Does anyone else think Graham Thorpe's trousers look funny/wrong?\" asks Adey Lobb. \"A bit like the draw string ones my gran used to wear.\" Looks like he's gone for the Simon Cowell deep tuck-in from here. 58th over: England 225-5 Last over now, and it will be nightwatchmen Matthew Hoggard to face Franklin from the Radcliffe Road End for the last five balls by the look of things. And he survives a strong lbw call third ball, and Hawkeye reckons he should be making his way to the showers by now. He doesn't have to wait long though, and England head in 159 behind on 225-5. It's been a great day's cricket, and we'll be back tomorrow to bring you every ball of it. Thanks for all your emails, and have a great weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
