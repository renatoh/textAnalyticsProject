A boxer and a boatman, as well as a singer and guitarist, he became famous back in 1948 when he shook up what was then the Belgian colony of the Congo with his light and lilting song, Marie-Louise. It became so popular that it was credited with magical powers, with devotees claiming it could heal the sick and raise the dead - to the concern of the church and authorities, who had him arrested as a result. Kelosoy's light, charming style influenced the rumba boom, but though he fell from fashion in the independence era he kept singing and now, at 82, is recognised as something of a Congolese hero. This set includes recordings he made for a new documentary about him, as well as earlier songs - including Marie-Louise. The instrumental passages probably work better on film, but his singing is still remarkably fine. An elegantly charming set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
