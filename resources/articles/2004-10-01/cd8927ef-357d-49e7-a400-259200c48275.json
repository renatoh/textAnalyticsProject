Jean-S\u00e9bastien and Ang\u00e9lique Fraysse faced charges of failing to prevent a crime involving bodily harm, after allowing their guest, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Colin, 29, to drive home after a night of heavy drinking in February 2000. After leaving their flat in Maizi\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Metz, Moselle, in eastern France, he drove three miles down the wrong side of a main road before hitting another car head-on and killing himself and a couple and two of their three children. The case was brought by the grandmother of the only surviving child, now nine, who claimed that Mr and Mrs Fraysse should have done more to stop their guest from driving, and could at least have called the police when he insisted in getting in the car. The lawyer for victims' family said that even if the Fraysses were not \"responsible they were still guilty\" and asked the court to punish them to set an example and avert future accidents. But the public prosecutor recommended acquittal, arguing it would not be desirable to set a legal precedent requiring people to inform on their friends and stressing that there was a difference between moral behaviour and the law. \"There is no legal obligation to denounce,\" Michel Senthille told the court. In their defence, Mr and Mrs Fraysse told the court that they had tried to stop their friend from driving, suggesting that he spend the night, hiding his car keys and trying to block his way out of their flat, until he became aggressive and they gave up. Their lawyer said they had done \"everything they could in the circumstances\" and the prosecution recognised that they had made a positive effort to prevent him from getting behind the wheel. Mrs Fraysse, 29, who was herself run over by a drink-driver when she was 16 and is now paraplegic, said she felt \"happy and relieved\" after the judgment was read out at the court in Nancy. She and her husband faced a prison sentence of up to five years or \u20ac75,000 (\u00a350,000) fines had they been found guilty. \"I wasn't responsible and the law has proved it,\" she said. \"It is the end of a nightmare. This has been going on for four years. You can imagine the pressure that we've been under.\" Bar owners in France can be held legally responsible if they allow a drunken customer to drive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
