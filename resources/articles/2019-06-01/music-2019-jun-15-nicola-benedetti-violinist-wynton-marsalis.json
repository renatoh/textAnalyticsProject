The youngest recipient of the Queen\u2019s medal for music, she is a passionate ambassador for music education, with her own foundation and YouTube channel. She will appear as soloist with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain (NYO) at the BBC Proms on 27 July. Her latest album, featuring recordings of works written for her by the jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, is released by Decca on 12 July. Wynton Marsalis has written all the music on your new disc \u2013 including a violin concerto and Fiddle Dance Suite \u2013 for you. What does it sound like? Wynton\u2019s music sounds a lot like him and the life he\u2019s led. The compositions take us from the introspection of a spiritual to the raucous celebration of a hootenanny, from a lullaby to a nightmare, and from a campfire to a circus. His consistent interest in playing and studying the music of Bach, Miles Davis, Beethoven, Ellington, Shostakovich, Coltrane, Bart\u00f3k, Louis Armstrong, on and on, makes for an absorption and understanding of wildly contrasting styles that is unique. Why was working with Marsalis so important? The music affirms a belief I\u2019ve held since childhood \u2013 that when we strip away our concepts of race, religion or culture, our DNA shows more similarity than difference. Both myself and Wynton always agree on one thing: we\u2019re interested in seeking out those commonalities, and his music expresses a desire for coming together and understanding one another. I hope the recording speaks to those with a curiosity in crossing cultures, and in complex, colourful and uplifting music. Earlier this year you launched the Benedetti Foundation. What\u2019s its aim? To advocate the role of music in schools and communities through workshops, and to provide support, information and inspiration to teachers. We won\u2019t be looking to reinvent the wheel. I\u2019ve been working alongside teachers and holding workshops for over 10 years and we will aim to address every level of instrumental music making, from beginners to conservatoire level. So much phenomenal teaching and music making is going on. The best gift I can give to anyone is to expose the best of what\u2019s going on to those who don\u2019t know where to find it. You hold positions with many youth music organisations including the NYO, National Children\u2019s Orchestra, Sistema Scotland and London Music Fund. Are you aiming at the next generation of music professionals, or at music\u2019s wider social purpose? Both! Music, if taught well, with love, passion and purpose, can provide life-changing experiences for many young people. My focus is not on trying to turn everyone into a musician but in a general enrichment of society, and challenging of the often negative images constantly paraded in front of young people. I also want to challenge and seek to improve the content of \u201cmusic education\u201d. Many professional musicians claim it does this and that, without being acutely aware of its content day to day. You started the violin aged four. By eight you were leading the National Children\u2019s Orchestra of Great Britain. What was the secret to harnessing your own talent as a child? I was actually most engaged with the emotion and depth of the music. I wasn\u2019t so interested in all the instrument\u2019s pyrotechnics to begin with. I wasn\u2019t really looking to win a race. Even aged six, I was moved to tears by music. Just listening to Tchaikovsky\u2019s Violin Concerto, or the second movement of Bruch\u2019s Violin Concerto, or Elgar\u2019s Salut d\u2019amour. I was driven by that desire to play, but I was also lucky to have a mother who understood you can\u2019t give up at every hurdle. She taught us that there\u2019s even deeper fun in true achievement. Millennials are reportedly tuning in to classical music. Can we ditch the idea of classical having an image problem? I\u2019m not a fan of focusing on classical music\u2019s supposed image problem. The race, culture and gender of the majority of composers we still play in concert halls is a fact. We can apologise for it, mask it, express dissatisfaction \u2013 it won\u2019t change the past. Does it make Beethoven\u2019s music less good or less powerful or less relevant? But music, in all its forms, can be studied, worked on, developed and created by anyone of any gender, race and culture. That is also a fact. If you have the exposure to it, it can become something to you.
