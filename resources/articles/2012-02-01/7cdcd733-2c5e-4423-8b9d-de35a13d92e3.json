He did not reveal how many England had made, meanwhile, but it is difficult to remember one. So let's call it 14-0 to the Scots. It is a statistic that tells of how far Scotland have come lately. And then we turn to that other statistic, the one known as the final score, and suddenly the other stat becomes not a sign of progress but a brutal indictment. Even in the context of what is now a four-match run without scoring a try, Scotland will need more than a stats man to explain how they let England in for their first win at Murrayfield since 2004. Watching them do it felt a little sickening, as if we were sitting idly by, letting a troubled creature inflict horrible ills upon itself. Certainly, Max Evans, who made a fair few of those 14 line-breaks, spoke afterwards as if in agony. \"Just gutted,\" he said. \"There was lots of talk about heads up, but it's very difficult to pick yourself up after a defeat like that. We're all far too passionate about what we do for a living to be come in here all smiles and laughing. I'm not going to lie. It's as frustrating as hell, especially for myself as a winger. \"We can't blame anyone except ourselves. It's all very well losing to a team that deserves to win, to get beaten by a better team, but when you lose to a team and you know you should have won it's so much more difficult. We let this match slip from our grasp. It's pretty devastating, really.\" As must be the case with such a statistical anomaly as this, there were contentious moments that Scotland will no doubt pore over in yet more agony \u2013 this time of the \"if\u2011only\" sort. Greig Laidlaw, who made such an impression when he came on at fly\u2011half for the final quarter, swears blind that he touched down the bobbling ball he chased with Ben Youngs following his chip to the tryline. It was, like so much for Scotland, painfully close, but after a lengthy deliberation by Nigel Whitehouse, the television match official, Laidlaw was deemed not to have applied downward pressure. And, as if that were not enough, George Clancy, the referee, did not go back for the relatively straightforward penalty he had signalled advantage for only a few seconds earlier, whose conversion would have brought Scotland to within one point with quarter of an hour to go. Why he didn't only he can explain. Of the many chances Scotland bombed, the most shinily gilt-edged came shortly afterwards when Ross Rennie, a real handful throughout, broke past three English defenders and fatally hesitated before trying to pass to one of Mike Blair or Laidlaw, both clear outside him. Ben Foden hit him with a tackle and knocked the ball on. Mr Clancy awarded a scrum, where many referees might have flashed yellow and awarded a penalty for a deliberate knock\u2011on. But this was not shaping up to be Scotland's night, and now this try\u2011shyness is turning into a major headache. \"It's definitely in the mind,\" said Evans, \"but I know it's something that's fixable. I think we're slightly overdoing things. We're trying to play this quick game and to keep the pressure going, but sometimes, at this level, you can't play at that speed for phase after phase.\" Fingers north of the border are starting to point at Gregor Townsend, Scotland's attack coach. Whether he can blamed when his team are creating so much is a moot point. Scotland's problem is becoming a mental one, and that is far harder to unpick. The best remedy for it, though, is a good old-fashioned dollop of luck. You sense that when the first try comes the others will follow. But it does not make it any easier to watch them agonise over the wait in the meantime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
