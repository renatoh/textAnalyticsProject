The 28-year-old has a troublesome achilles tendon injury that ruled him out of last month's one-day internationals with the West Indies and though he was fit enough to play in the ICC World Twenty20, he had not fully healed. Pietersen recently warned that the injury could threaten his participation, saying: \"I'm taking the best medical advice and doing everything I can to face Australia but, occasionally, achilles injuries do flare up. If that happens on the morning of a Test I wouldn't be able to take part.\" And Warne believes the home side could not replace their former captain if he was ruled out. \"The one person England have to have is Kevin Pietersen,\" said the former Australia leg-spinner. \"If England haven't got Pietersen I don't believe they can win. He's just a wonderful player.\" Pietersen played under Warne at Hampshire and his attacking 158 during the final Ashes test at The Oval four years ago proved decisive. \"I'm expecting some big things from him,\" Warne added, before also underlining the importance of Andrew Flintoff, who has only recently returned from his latest injury, to England's cause. \"If the England side's got an Andrew Flintoff in it that can bowl and bat, it's stronger. He's a very determined character; one of his strengths is his ability to carry the rest of the team.\" Warne, though, is less sure about where he should bat. \"I don't think a No6 in Test cricket can average 30 [actually 31.69], especially if you've got a Paul Collingwood at five and Matt Prior at seven. If you lose a few wickets with the new ball you could be in trouble. Collingwood bats better with someone like Pietersen; I don't think he performs that well if he has to take on the mantle himself.\" There was criticism, too, for Ravi Bopara and Monty Panesar, both of whom are in the England XI that meets Warwickshire on 1 July in the final Ashes warm-up. \"Bopara is a bit like Owais Shah \u2013 each has as much talent as I've seen,\" Warne said. \"But I think Bopara lacks the temperament. With a bit of gamesmanship you can put him off. The couple of times I've played against him we've done that, he's got no runs and played some ordinary shots. The Australians will go after him, he's going to be batting No3, facing the new ball a lot, and Mitchell Johnson will [target him] \u2013 I don't think he'll get many runs. Monty Panesar is a wonderful bowler but I'm disappointed that he's stayed the same. I think the sign of good Test player is to improve.\" Instead, Warne believes the leg-spinner, Adil Rashid, who is in the 16-man Ashes squad, should play. \"England haven't rushed Rashid and I think he's played pretty well in his limited opportunity in [the World] Twenty20,\" he said of the 21-year-old. \" should play in the first Test with Graeme Swann. Rashid and Graeme Swann; Ryan Sidebottom and James Anderson \u2013 that's a really well-balanced attack for the conditions you're going to have over here.\" And Warne's prediction for who will win the urn? \"If you had to put your house on someone you'd put it on Australia. But you wouldn't be surprised if England won.\" Shane Warne is commentating for Sky Sports during its exclusively live and high definition coverage of The Ashes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
