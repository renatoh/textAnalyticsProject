Once again, scroll down to watch all the trailers from the games shown tonight. One last quick reveal before we go: it\u2019s a teaser for a new God of War, basically a logo and that\u2019s it. Ragnarok is coming, we are informed - 2021. Not much, but something to look forward to. The PlayStation 5 will be \u00a3449 The digital-only edition is \u00a3359 November 12th is the release date in most of the world, November 19th for some territories. Sony is now introducing the PlayStation Plus Collection - a benefit for Plus subscribers. We\u2019re seeing a selection of PS4 greatest hits - Monster Hunter World, God of War, Infamous Second Son, Batman Arkham Knight, The Last Guardian, The Last of Us Remastered, Persona 5, Bloodborne, Uncharted 5, loads more. If you buy a PS5 then you get access to all of them, day one, to download. Not bad. Demon\u2019s Souls here looking as beautiful as it does in my memory. Can we just talk for a minute about how extraordinary this game truly was - so mysterious, so gothic, so THRILLING. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling I got seeing those blue glowing eyes down the end of a corridor about ten seconds before getting absolutely ended by a blue-eye knight for the first time. The demo ends, fittingly, ten seconds into a boss fight. Why am I seeing a Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s game in a PlayStation 5 showcase in the year 2020!? This was unexpected. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security breach is distinctly less lo-fi than the cult horror playground sensations from a few years ago. Another quick look now at Oddworld Soulstorm, an unlikely new entry in the disconcerting series of expectation-defying platformers. Ultimate early-00s emo demon-killing series Devil May Cry 5 is getting a special-edition PS5 re-release. That soundtrack. CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG KILL ALL THE DEMONS CHUG CHUG *solo* That\u2019ll be available digitally at launch. Arkane\u2019s stylish shooter Deathloop features two assassins with supernatural powers caught in an endless time loop. I\u2019d describe its aesthetic as 70s James Bond but in the future, or blaxploitation but sci-fi. Chris Redfield is in Resident Evil 8 (also known as Village). It looks frankly hideous and terrifying, with a small-town setting (think Resident Evil 4 revisited), which surely will delight horror fans. Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War looks very much like a Call of Duty game in the next short demo. We\u2019re scouting out an airfield through binoculars in search of an assassination target before witnessing a bunch of murder, replete with slow-motion sniper bullets and a bomb-detonating RC car. The multiplayer alpha is exclusive to PlayStation. Avalanche\u2019s long-rumoured Harry Potter game from Warner Bros is the next announcement: we FINALLY get to play as a Hogwarts student (AMAZING) during the Fantastic Beast period (lame) in the late 1800s. You can even get out of Hogwarts into what looks like some open-world exploration. I\u2019m going full Millennial right now and bouncing about on the sofa: I finally get to go to Hogwarts at the age of 32. It\u2019ll be out 2021. An extended look now at Spider-Man: Miles Morales, whose events pick up a year after the events of the last game. The villain is a gender-swapped Tinkerer (dead ringer for Mass Effect\u2019s Tali imo), it\u2019s set in Harlem, and there is a new array of high-tech enemies. The demo takes us through a pretty spectacular rescue on a blown-apart bridge. Final Fantasy XVI is a PlayStation 5 exclusive! JRPG Game of Thrones vibes from the latest in Square-Enix\u2019s long-running fantasy series. It has epic monsters in a medieval-esque setting, the plot appears to involve crystals, and the combat has a bit of a Devil May Cry look. Here\u2019s the reveal trailer: I\u2019d tell you what my dream announcements would be, but honestly my dream announcement was a Demon\u2019s Souls remake and that\u2019s already happened. The return of Parappa the Rapper in 4K!? Of course, since June, Microsoft has announced plenty more info about its rival console(s), the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X. The whole of Twitter has been arguing about whether or not the marketing is confusing - which, to me, is a fairly good indication that it IS confusing - but here\u2019s the basic info: -The Xbox Series S is an entry-level version of the new Xbox that will cost \u00a3249. It has no disc drive and cannot play games in 4K. -The Xbox Series X will cost \u00a3449 and outputs in 4K, and has a disc drive It\u2019s a super aggressive price point from Microsoft - and coupled with Xbox Game Pass, which offers access to every new game from Microsoft\u2019s studios, every new EA game and hundreds more for just over \u00a310 a month, it\u2019s really turned some heads. Xbox is even offering interest-free payment plans that can get you into the next generation of consoles for \u00a320.99 a month. That\u2019s very attractive, and cheaper in real terms than a cutting-edge games console has ever been before. Let\u2019s quickly recap some of the games we\u2019ve seen so far on this futuristic-looking black and white monolith of a console: -Spider-Man: Miles Morales, an updated and enhanced Spider-Man game -Horizon: Forbidden West, a sequel to Zero Dawn, the spectacular robo-dinosaur open-world adventure -Grand Theft Auto V, YET AGAIN -Gran Turismo 7, featuring the World\u2019s Prettiest Cars -Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, a stupendously good-looking cartoonish romp -Returnal, a sci-fi thriller from Housemarque -Sackboy: A Big Adventure, a friendly platformer starring LittleBigPlanet\u2019s mascot -Hitman 3, the puzzle game disguised as a game about murder -Bugsnax, the Internet\u2019s favourite, a game that so far defies explanation -A REMAKE OF DEMON\u2019S SOULS!!! (ahem) -And who could forget Stray, the cyberpunk game about cats? Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s PlayStation 5 showcase liveblog! I\u2019m Keza MacDonald, video games editor, here to parse and analyse whatever Sony shows tonight. That\u2019ll certainly be a date and price for the new console, but we\u2019re looking at a 40-minute livestream here, so that definitely will not be all. A few new games will be likely, and we\u2019ll probably see more of the games announced at the showcase back in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
