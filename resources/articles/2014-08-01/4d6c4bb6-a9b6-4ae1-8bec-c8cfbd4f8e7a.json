Trade union Unison, which represents about 500 of the 1,100 staff working for the Food Standards Agency (FSA), said planned action would affect as many as four in 10 slaughterhouses across England, Scotland and Wales. \"The strike may well clear supermarket shelves and butchers' shops of meat and threaten summer barbecues,\" said Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison. \"It is down to the FSA to come up with a fair offer instead of digging in their heels and refusing to negotiate.\" Action may yet be averted as Unison has written to the FSA seeking negotiations via arbitration body Acas. The FSA said it was considering its response. Prentis said workers had voted to strike after the FSA imposed a 0.75% pay rise, the fifth year a pay offer was below inflation. \"Working in slaughterhouses is an extremely messy and stressful job and our members will not accept another cut in the value of their wage,\" Prentis said. The union has yet to reveal details of its planned action \u2013 but it has to give a week's notice of a strike, which must take place within 28 days of the vote, which was completed on Monday. If a strike went ahead, disruption could be serious. Abattoirs cannot operate without an official vet on site. Meat inspectors are also a vital part of the supply chain, particularly in the wake of the horsemeat scandal, which highlighted the potential for contamination in retailers' supply chains. Butchers and meat processing operators said they believed the meat supply system was flexible enough to ensure shoppers could still buy meat. Richard Stevenson at the National Federation of Meat &amp; Food Traders, which represents thousands of independent butchers and food stores, said: \"We are concerned but we need to see how the situation develops. It's still early days.\" He said that a similar strike about three years ago had not led to significant disruption because the FSA and meat processors had been able to take contingency action. Fiona Steiger at the British Meat Processing Association agreed: \"We are very disappointed and concerned that it looks like this strike is going to happen but we are hoping that like last time there is little noticeable impact.\" An FSA spokesperson said: \"Should Unison decide to take strike action, our contingency plans will minimise any disruption to meat supplies.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
