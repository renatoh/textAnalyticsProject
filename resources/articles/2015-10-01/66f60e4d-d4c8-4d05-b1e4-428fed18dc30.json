Approximately 100 workers forced their way into a meeting of the airline\u2019s senior management and ripped the shirts from the backs of the executives. The airline filed a criminal complaint after the employees stormed its headquarters, near Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, in what was condemned as a \u201cscandalous\u201d outbreak of violence. Photographs showed one ashen-faced director being led through a baying crowd, his clothes torn to shreds. In another picture, the deputy head of human resources, Xavier Broseta, left bare-chested after workers ripped off his shirt and jacket, is photographed being pushed to safety over a fence. Tensions between management and workers at France\u2019s loss-making flagship carrier had been building over the weekend in the runup to a meeting aimed at finalising a controversial \u201crestructuring plan\u201d involving 2,900 redundancies between now and 2017. The proposed job losses involve 1,700 ground staff, 900 cabin crew and 300 pilots. After the violence erupted at about 9.30am on Monday, there was widespread condemnation from French union leaders who sought to blame each other\u2019s members for the assaults. Laurent Berger, secretary general of the CFDT, said the attacks were \u201cundignified and unacceptable\u201d, while Claude Mailly, of Force Ouvri\u00e8re (Workers Force) said he understood Air France workers\u2019 exasperation, but added: \u201cOne can fight management without being violent.\u201d Manuel Valls, France\u2019s prime minister, said he was \u201cscandalised\u201d by the behaviour of staff and offered the airline chiefs his \u201cfull support\u201d. Air France said it had lodged an official police complaint for \u201caggravated violence\u201d. Several hundred airline employees had gathered to demonstrate outside Air France\u2019s head office and members of senior management were greeted by an angry crowd shouting and waving flags and placards featuring the company chiefs portrayed as criminals in police mugshots. As executives entered the building, dozens of workers forced their way into the committee room shouting \u201cthis is our home\u201d. The Air France president, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gagey, escaped unharmed. However, Pierre Plissonnier, vice-president of the airline\u2019s Orly airport hub, was attacked. Afterwards, Broseta told a press conference that he was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by the attack, but added: \u201cWhat we saw this morning is not typical of company staff.\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019ve received hundreds of messages of sympathy from union representatives and colleagues.\u201d The French finance minister tweeted his support for the attacked men. \u201cThose who engage in violence are irresponsible. Nothing can replace social dialogue,\u201d Emmanuel Macron wrote. The French employers organisation, MEDEF, blamed an \u201cirresponsible minority\u201d for \u201cunacceptable and scandalous aggression\u201d. Air France was founded in 1933 and in 2004 merged with the Dutch airline KLM to create the world\u2019s fifth-largest air transport company. Increased competition from Middle Eastern rivals and budget airlines recently prompted the loss-making group to seek a reorganisation and \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.3bn) savings. The company is also planning to close five long-haul routes and sell off 14 of its larger, long distance aircraft. On Monday morning, before the demonstration, Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the powerful CGT union, told RTL radio: \u201cFor several years now, successive heads of Air France have suggested rescue plans \u2026 each time, it\u2019s a bottomless pit with the same suggestions. I believe they are trying to set one lot of us against the other. We need a real expert appraisal of the situation.\u201d He admitted that Air France had been hard hit by the deregulation of the industry and the popularity of low-cost airlines. Before the meeting, a government official, St\u00e9phane Le Foll, said all parties had to get round the table to thrash out an agreement. \u201cI call on everyone, especially the pilots, to make an effort,\u201d he told France Inter radio. After the violence, Air France said the committee meeting would be postponed until Monday afternoon, before cancelling it altogether. In a statement, the airline said executives were willing to negotiate with workers but \u201cunder certain conditions\u201d. Alexandre de Juniac, president of Air France-KLM, said the group condemned \u201cthe physical violence that took place around the executive meeting with the greatest firmness\u201d, adding that it nevertheless \u201cdoes not alter the management\u2019s willingness to continue discussions\u201d. It is not the first time French workers have taken matters into their own hands with violent results. Since 2009, as the global economic crisis has escalated, several bosses have been held hostage by angry staff. In January 2014, workers at a Goodyear factory in northern France prevented two managers from leaving and said the pair would be held until the company gave a \u201csatisfactory response to requests\u201d. Olivier Labarre, director of BTI, a human resources consultancy, told Lib\u00e9ration newspaper in 2009: \u201cThis happens elsewhere, but to my knowledge, taking the boss hostage is typically French. It\u2019s the nature of the social dialogue in our country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
