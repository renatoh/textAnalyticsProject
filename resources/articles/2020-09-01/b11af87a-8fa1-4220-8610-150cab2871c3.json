His Liverpool team delivered the lesson, after all, and Arsenal will be in their sights twice next week at Anfield following this exhibition at Sincil Bank. Curtis Jones curated the rout with a performance that comprised touches of class, prodigious work rate and two exquisite goals. There were many of them. Takumi Minamino also scored twice as the Premier League champions eased into round four and what will be a third meeting of the season with Mikel Arteta\u2019s team, who beat Liverpool on penalties in the Community Shield last month. \u201cThe Arsenal week!\u201d as Klopp put it. \u201cThank God we are at home twice.\u201d Lincoln may have had hope after an unbeaten start to their campaign, and Liverpool made 10 changes from Sunday\u2019s win at Chelsea, but the gulf between League One and a newly assembled Premier League side was evident immediately. The visitors were two outstanding goals to the good before Lincoln had orchestrated an attack, although it was to their credit that they never folded and indeed improved after falling 5-0 behind early in the second half. Klopp\u2019s collection of young talent, the debutant Rhys Williams, the new signing Kostas Tsimikas, seasoned squad players and Virgil van Dijk were so dominant in the first half they used it for shooting practice. The fiercest competition was between those wearing Liverpool\u2019s shocking new away strip, and which one of them could score the finer goal. Xherdan Shaqiri auditioned first with a stunning free-kick. The intent was clear as the Switzerland international sized up the set piece at a testing angle but Alex Palmer was powerless to stop it flying in his top corner off the underside of the bar. Shaqiri, making only his second Liverpool appearance since January following injury, struck the ball with such power and accuracy that the Lincoln goalkeeper and wall were rendered irrelevant. It would be Klopp\u2019s favourite of the night. \u201cThey were all nice goals but Shaq\u2019s was unbelievable,\u201d he admitted. Van Dijk\u2019s surprise inclusion was due to a shortage of central defensive options. But there was insurance in Klopp\u2019s thinking. Alongside him stood 19-year-old Rhys Williams, who spent last season on loan at Kidderminster and was part of Liverpool\u2019s FA Youth Cup-winning squad in 2019. There could be no better guide for Williams\u2019s debut than the Netherlands\u2019 captain, and Van Dijk was not overworked before being replaced by Fabinho at the interval. Liverpool were gifted a second by Lewis Montsma, the Dutch model/defender who miscued a clearance straight to Harvey Elliott amid the visitors\u2019 intensive pressing. Elliott\u2019s attempted pass to Divock Origi was intercepted by Montsma but there would be no reprieve. His touch fell to Minamino who swept a delightful shot around Palmer from 20 yards. Lincoln\u2019s first attempt on goal arrived with the tie already beyond them, Adri\u00e1n tipping away James Jones\u2019 angled shot. Timothy Eyoma then headed over from Max Melbourne\u2019s inviting cross. The other Jones on display, Curtis, showed them how to really finish. Origi headed Rhys Williams\u2019 raking ball to the Liverpool midfielder, who stepped inside Harry Anderson before curling another unstoppable shot inside Palmer\u2019s left corner. Minutes later he repeated the trick, collecting Elliott\u2019s pass and gliding away from Jorge Grant before sending a similar effort past the Lincoln keeper via a deflection. The second half brought no immediate respite for the hosts. Only 20 seconds had elapsed when the Liverpool press again broke Lincoln\u2019s attempt to play out from the back. Palmer saved at the feet of Elliott but the rebound looped up for Minamino to roll in his second. It was to Lincoln\u2019s credit that 5-0 sparked a reaction and not a deeper collapse. Adri\u00e1n saved from Anthony Scully and Eyoma sliced horribly wide from Grant\u2019s free-kick. Tayo Edun did grab a consolation when he received Scully\u2019s cross and placed a cool finish inside the bottom corner. Liverpool quickly restored their five-goal lead when a cross by the new signing Diogo Jota was cleared to Marko Grujic. The Serb midfielder, who has spent the past two seasons on loan at Hertha Berlin, drove a shot through a crowded penalty area but past Palmer\u2019s grasp too easily. Montsma headed home a second for Lincoln when Adri\u00e1n completely missed Grant\u2019s corner and the defender towered above Fabinho to convert. Origi completed the scoring in the final minute with a powerful drive after Minamino led a rapid counterattack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
