The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said that while he was delighted English football was returning, starting with Aston Villa hosting Sheffield United on Wednesday evening, fans had to understand the implications of breaking the rules. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a loosening of lockdown but at the moment we require everyone to abide by the rules and I don\u2019t want a situation where fans gather and police have to disperse them,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for football, bad for sport and bad for the progress we\u2019ve made over the past few weeks. If people do congregate rather than follow the guidance, it will put people in danger and it will threaten football\u2019s future.\u201d Huddleston said he understood the urge for fans to want to celebrate their side winning matches, but with every game on TV for the rest of the season there was no excuse not to stay at home. \u201cWe have had this long debate of whether we have neutral stadia versus home games and I think neutral games come back on the cards if we can\u2019t manage local crowds. Fans are much more comfortable, as are the players, if it\u2019s home games. That\u2019s a principle I understand. But the option of neutral stadiums comes back if we can\u2019t. \u201cAnd the sooner we can get over the coronavirus pandemic, then the sooner we can get fans back into the stadiums, which is something that we all want.\u201d That message was backed by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who released a video message to Liverpool supporters on Tuesday promising them his team would still feel their presence. \u201cI will make the boys feel your support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will use it. You are still the 80%-90% of the petrol in our tanks. We really will use that and we will need that but the final message is stay safe and support us from home. We are still with you and you will never walk alone.\u201d A recent poll found that 40% of people thought the Premier League was returning too quickly, but Huddleston insisted every precaution was in place for the players and staff at grounds. \u201cA lot of work has gone into making sure that from the logistics and the medical testing and everything that risk is minimised to the greatest extent possible. This has been done in incredibly stringent conditions.\u201d Huddleston also promised that an upcoming review into the sports governance code would consider specific targets for sports to have more people of black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds in their boardrooms. \u201cSport England and UK Sport have helped identify people who could be suitable so I think it\u2019s really important we grow the pipeline of people for leadership positions and that\u2019s one of the most important things we can do. When it comes to quotas or targets, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be investigating. I\u2019m not saying anything for definite, but we\u2019re looking into it. We are woefully behind on BAME representation and we need to continue to focus on that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
