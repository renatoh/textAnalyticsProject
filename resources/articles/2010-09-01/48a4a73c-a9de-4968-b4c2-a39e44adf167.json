We have indeed, Steve, how the heck are you? Ready and willing, Small Talk! That's good to hear, Steve. Unfortunately, Small Talk isn't in such fine fettle. For as we speak Small Talk is being mocked and abused by colleagues for admitting that until a few minutes ago it had not been aware that octopi can squirt ink and ... [Incredulous laughter] How can you not know that?! What, you mean you knew? Of course I knew! Everyone knows that. Really? How did you find out? Oh come on, it's one of those things that you pick up as a kid from cartoons and so on. [Sceptically] Which cartoon? I don't remember, but that's where I got most of my general knowledge! I bet if I ask my four-year-old what an octopus can do he'll know. OK, go ask him ... Actually, now that I think of it, I can tell you how else I know: once when I was fishing for squid in New Zealand, we were shining a light on the top of the water to see all the crustaceans or whatever and I lifted a squid on to the boat and the captain went ballistic at me! He kept saying it would stain the deck of the boat. Apparently you're supposed to lift it into a bucket of water. [Testily] What colour is the ink? Black. OK. And octopi blood is blue. Did you know that? No, I have to admit I didn't [chastened chuckles] 1-1! Can you handle another question? Go for it. Actually, it's an easy one ... because it's not really a question at all, just the mandatory tee-up for the product you're promoting today: what is so good about Alfa Romeos? Ah, well let me tell you first of all that they are the sponsor of UK Athletics so we're very appreciative of their support. Beyond that, they've been a big hit in the car world recently. They've got a great fleet of cars. It's a very refined car now I think, I'm certainly not a petrol head and I've enjoyed it very much. Well that's great. Now then, is there any exciting British javelin talent we need to know about? It's pretty good on the women's side. There's a female thrower called Goldie Sayers and she came fourth in Beijing and she's holding the limelight in the javelin. As for the men, there's Mervyn Luckwell \u2013 but it's luck by name but not by nature at the moment: he can throw far but he needs to learn how to deliver at the championships, which is a whole science in itself. How did you get into the javelin? My father was a pretty decent middle distance runner in his day and I grew up going running with him and thoroughly enjoyed it. So I was kind of around the athletics scene but because I was quite big I didn't have the physical conditions for middle distance running and one day I saw these guys chucking a thing around a field and thought 'that looks like a laugh, I'll have a go at that'. So that's what I did. But it was no Cinderella story, quite the opposite in fact. I was bloody awful at first! But I enjoyed it and it seemed to make sense so I started on my journey, gradually making progress. By the end of the first year I was ranked fifth in the country for my age. And then I broke my arm and had a year off! Tell us this, Steve, with your phenomenal throwing prowess you'd probably have made a decent quarterback: did you ever consider a lucrative move into American football? I probably couldn't have made it as a quarterback because that's a very technical position but I'll tell you what, there was some interest as a baseball pitcher. Pitchers are massively reliant on a fast arm more than technique. My sort-of-nemesis, Jan Zelezny, tried out for the Atlanta Braves and they were very impressed with his speed of relase, which was over 100mph, which only the top pitchers can do, but his aim wasn't so flash. In fact, at this media day they set up to have another look at him he hit a Japanese photographer, which I found quite amusing. But apparently in the Atlanta Braves stadium, only three people have ever thrown a home run from the plate where you hit from, which is about 120 yards or something... and he did it with his first throw. You see, throwing flat wasn't so easy but once you have to put a bit of elevation into it like a javelin thrower he was brilliant. So would you have fancied a crack at that? For sure! For no other reason than they earn a hell of a lot more money than a javelin thrower! Sound reasoning. By the way, have you ever been to Finland? Yes, I have. Javelin is the national sport in Finland. You know, here in England I may occasionally get recognised when I'm at Sainsbury's or wherever but I cannot walk around the streets of Finland \u2013 I'm like David Beckham there! Seriously? Yeah, it's hilarious! So presumably you go there whenever you need a morale boost? I used to spend a lot of time there but since I've retired I've not been back. Any idea why the Finns are particularly taken by the javelin? I don't know where their love of the javelin came from, to be honest. I think it fits the personality of the race \u2013 you know, tall, strong guys, almost like Viking shapes. They're pretty ... um, how can I describe the Finns? They're quite an unusual crowd actually. And I mean that in the nicest possible way. I think it's the simple bravado of being able to throw something farther than someone else that is in line with their mentality. Sounds plausible to Small Talk. Then again, the only thing Small Talk knows about Finland is that exceptionally dark heavy metal bands abound there ... They do, yeah. Javelin and death metal: it's a heady mix! Are you a headbanger? I don't listen to heavy metal, I skipped that bit. So what sort of music do you listen to? I like a wide spectrum really. A bit of pop, a bit of dance, a bit of Motown, that kind of thing. Did you have a particular song you listened to before competing to motivate you? I did actually. I had the same track that I listened to for my whole career: It was Soul II Soul, Back to Life. The words, the rhythm, it's just one of those timeless tunes. You still hear it on the radio. And when you hear it on the radio now do you feel an immediate urge to fling a javelin? [Chortling] I do yeah, I'm one of Pavlov's dogs! The only thing is it doesn't work any more: I was at my kid's school sports day the other day and someone convinced me to chuck a kid's javelin. I flicked the first one and got a round of applause and then they said 'go on, throw a big long one'. And the juices were flowing and I said to myself 'right, this one's going over the fence.' So I lashed it with all I've got ... and it went the same distance as the first one. I just turned around and said 'that's why I've retired!'. You know when you put your foot on the gas and nothing happens? That was me. A horrible, horrible feeling. It was still farther than the kid's throws, though, right? Just about. And they were only four and five! Speaking of children, what was your favourite toy as a child? A Rubik's Cube. Did you complete it? Yes. I taught myself to do it. I think that sums up my personality: I wouldn't put it down until I worked out how to do it. How long did it take you? I think my fastest was 47 seconds. I picked one up the other day for the first time in about 20 years and did it in four and a half minutes and I was quite pleased with that. The system that I devised still applies. Who is your favourite TV detective? I'll say Starsky and Hutch because as a kid I had a Starsky and Hutch car. I used to love the way they jumped across the bonnet to get into it. Would it be fair to say that that is the most iconic vehicle in TV history? Or is it overshadowed by the A-Team fan and the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine? I think so, but what type of car was the Starsky and Hutch one? I can't remember. Nor can Small Talk. How about we say it was an Alfa Romeo? Good one! Steve, have you ever seen a ghost? I had a ghost in my first house, which I bought when I was 20. I never saw it but it came and visited some guests. It wasn't a particularly friendly ghost and my friend described it materialising in the night as a beast that scared the living daylights out of him. It was bizarre. So let's get this straight: it marched around in the middle of the night and your guests saw it but you never did. Do you, by any chance, happen to be a sleepwalker? [Guffaws] Well we never really got to the bottom of it, I just moved. But weird things happened. For example, I went out and locked all the doors and when I came back all the doors and windows were open. That happened a couple of times and it wasn't burglaries or anything. Did you look into the history of the house? Not really. There were all sorts of theories, from World War bunkers and so on. I tried to dismiss it but once I started buying into it I just thought I've got to move. When you were trying to sell it, did you mention to prospective buyers that it might be haunted? No. But I think I can get away with it because I never actually saw anything. And if in retrospect anything happened, I deny all knowledge! That's the spirit! Thanks for your time, Steve. It was a pleasure. Bye bye Small Talk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
