That was the shocking news to come out of the president's first medical check-up since he moved into the Oval Office. Except that it wasn't. Instead, the noise machine got excited by the next line from the presidential physician, urging \"moderation in alcohol intake\". So does that mean the president of the United States is fond of a drink, wink wink? Not at all \u2013 let's read the actual report and put it in context: Summary The President is in excellent health and \"fit for duty\". All clinical data indicate that he will remain so for the duration of his presidency. The President completed all age-appropriate screening tests, to include colorectal cancer screening. A CT-colonography was performed with normal results. Recommendations Follow-up colorectal cancer screening is recommended in 5 years for routine colon cancer screening. Continue smoking cessation efforts, a daily exercise program, healthy diet, moderation in alcohol intake, periodic dental care, and remain up to date with recommend immunizations. Continue modified exercise regimen, and lower extremity muscle strengthening program, for occasional left patella-femoral pain secondary to chronic tendonitis. Recommend dietry modification to reduce LDL cholesterol below 130. There's more, which can be read in full here (PDF), but it's pretty dull stuff. (Body mass index of 23.7?) Obama's failure to give up smoking is interesting, since that is something he has publically vowed to do in the past. But the alcohol line, along with the recommendation for daily exercise, dentist visits and a healthy diet, are exactly what doctors routinely say to anyone having a check-up. Over at Cif America, there's a poll on whether Obama should be able to have the odd smoke and Budweiser. So far, about 70% think the leader of the free world deserves a drink and a Marlboro Light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
