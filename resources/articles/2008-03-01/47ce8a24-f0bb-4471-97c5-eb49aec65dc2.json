Although his company has successful blogs such as Gawker, Gizmodo and Lifehacker, it has increased in prominence this year by carring a video that \"features Tom Cruise extolling the virtues of Scientology and is both compulsive viewing and buttock-clenchingly embarrassing\". The Observer also has a feature on The world's 50 most powerful blogs, as Bobbie Johnson has posted over at our PDA blog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
