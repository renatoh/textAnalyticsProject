He says it himself. For starters, he doesn't wear funny sunglasses or get followed by posses of fawning fans. But in the space of six weeks, this silver-haired Briton has done more to bludgeon the business world into tackling the evil practice of human trafficking than possibly any one alive. Before an amphitheatre of several Nobel peace laureates and Egypt's great and good, Arkless urged international business leaders to confront the scourge. 'Global corporations must do something about issues like this for the good of the future,' he said. 'The trafficking of men, women and children is growing at twice the speed of the drugs trade, and is the fastest growing sector of organised crime.' Arkless would be easier to ignore if he weren't the senior vice-president of Manpower, the biggest non-government provider of employment in the world. With 5,000 offices in 70 countries, Manpower provides employment for nearly three million people worldwide. Arkless is determined that the US-based recruitment agency should lead by example. To this end, Manpower hosted a reception to raise awareness of trafficking among business leaders at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Its aim? To get each one to endorse the Athens Declaration, a code of conduct that seeks to ensure companies show zero tolerance for forced labour. Arkless is hoping the world's top 1,000 companies sign up within the year; he said companies that didn't sign would be named and shamed. He sees the declaration as the start of a corporate strategy against the trade. The document has been sent to Manpower's 250,000 customer companies, from multinationals to small and medium-sized enterprises. Afterwards, it will be sent to each of Manpower's 400,000 suppliers. 'If you take the multiplier effect into account, there's a chance that we could get virtually every company in the world to sign up to this within the next five years,' enthused Arkless. The people smuggling industry is now worth $32bn. While there are 12.3 million victims of forced labour in the world, according to the International Labour Organisation, it is estimated more than two million men, women and children are illicitly trafficked across borders every year. For smugglers, human chattel has value added over drugs or arms running because it can be re-sold over and over again. Profits from the flesh trade alone are valued at $28bn. Few traffickers, proportionately, are ever arrested. The head of Interpol, who will be meeting Arkless to put the finishing touch to an action plan in London next week, recently admitted that he has only three officers actively working on the issue. 'Governments have not been able to deal with it, so it's very important that businesses join the battle,' said Shafik Gabr, who chairs the Arab Business Council. 'We've declared war on this.' Arkless admits that the campaign is not without financial risk. Manpower, for one, could lose 'a lot' if it had to cut lucrative client contracts. But with fear of exposure increasingly motivating corporate philanthropy, doing good has become as big a priority as profit for some of the business world. Companies are also discovering that implementing philanthropic policies is a good way to recruit and retain employees lured by the prospect of 'making a difference'. After rainforests and third world debt relief, human trafficking must be added to the list of charitable causes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
