The precedent set by Alfie Conn in 1976 when he joined Celtic from Tottenham having earlier played for Rangers was followed 13 years later by Maurice Johnston's move to Ibrox from Nantes after flirting all summer with a return to Celtic. Miller scored 50 league goals in five seasons at Wolves after his \u00a33m transfer from Rangers and prompted Wolverhampton poet Andy Fisher to compose a stanza in tribute to him. \"The best scorer, Kenny Miller/ thankfully don't play for Villa,\" he wrote. \"Curls the ball in the back of the net/ Money on him is a sure bet.\" But more critical musings were sung at Molineux when the Scotland international signed a pre-contract agreement with the Premierleague champions in January. Celtic's busy pre-season schedule took them to the US earlier this month where Miller was heavily criticised for the lunge on John Wilson that earned him a red card in the 4-0 defeat by DC United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
