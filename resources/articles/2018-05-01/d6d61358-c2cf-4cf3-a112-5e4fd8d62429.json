The chestnut colt trained by Bob Baffert and rode by Mike Smith galloped to his fifth victory in five tries in an all-enveloping fog without precedent at Pimlico to keep alive his bid for one of the rarest feats in all of sports. Bravazo finished second and Tenfold took third in the $1.5m race while Good Magic, the runner-up a fortnight ago at Churchill Downs, came in fourth before an announced crowd of 134,487, the third-largest in Preakness history. \u201cIt was a nail-biter,\u201d Baffert said in the immediate aftermath of the 1 3/16-mile showcase. \u201cThey put it to us. That was a good horse (Good Magic) and it was like they had their own private match race. Somebady had to give, and I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d Justify, who went off as a heavy 2-5 favorite out of the No7 post, took the lead early on but briefly surrendered it to Good Magic along the backstretch running side by side ahead of the pack. They were nose to nose coming out of the final turn, but the son of Scat Daddy pulled away and held off charges in the last furlong by Bravazo and Tenfold under adroit handling by Smith, who at 52 becomes the oldest ever jockey to win the Preakness in the race\u2019s 143-year history. \u201cI keep telling you guys what a mind he has,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you go back and really look at it, he\u2019s staring right down the racetrack and wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off the door until they opened.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s everyone dream to win the Kentucky Derby, and after you\u2019re blessed to win that all you dream about is winning the Triple Crown. At my age, man, what a way to retire into the sunset, though I don\u2019t intend on retiring any time soon.\u201d Baffert has never lost the middle jewel of the Triple Crown after winning the Derby with Silver Charm, Real Quiet (1998), War Emblem (2002), American Pharoah (2015) and now Justify having done the double. The Hall of Fame trainer\u2019s seven lifetime Preakness wins moves him level with the all-time mark set by RW Walden in the 1800s. The colt will now attempt to become the only undefeated Triple Crown winner besides Seattle Slew in 1977 and just the 12th horse overall to sweep the Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes, three storied races run at varying lengths in different states over five weeks. Justify had been regarded as a freakish talent but an untested one until he ended a 136-year-old hoodoo at the Kentucky Derby with his fourth straight triumph, also from the seven slot and also on a sloppy track, becoming the first horse to win the Derby having not raced as a two-year-old since 1882. \u201cThey tested his fitness today,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey went on him early and he kept pushing on me and pushing on me to see if they could wear me out. Blessed to be on a horse with this much talent.\u201d Now he will go into Belmont Park as America\u2019s next great equine sensation as he looks to enter a storied roll of thoroughbreds to sweep America\u2019s three most celebrated races, joining Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), Affirmed (1978) and American Pharoah (2015). \u201cWe\u2019ll get him back to Kentucky and see how he trains,\u201d said Baffert, who can become only the second ever trainer to win the Triple Crown twice after the great Jim Fitzsimmons more than eight decades ago with Gallant Fox and Omaha. \u201cBut right now I say why not?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
