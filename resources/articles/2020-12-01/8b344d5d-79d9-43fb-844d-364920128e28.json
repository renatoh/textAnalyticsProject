Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side beat their local rivals three times last season, albeit with City winning their Carabao Cup semi-final on aggregate, and De Bruyne is prepared for United to sit back once again, despite their wealth of forward options. The City playmaker said: \u201cThey have some new players and maybe they will play a bit more offensively but we will see. After five minutes you are going to know what is happening in the game. They played defensively and on the counter last season and picked us off really well. I remember the home game when we lost 1-2 but we made a couple of mistakes and it was difficult to come back. They won three out of four last year so we need to try and make that right.\u201d De Bruyne also expects United\u2019s exit from the Champions League on Tuesday to prompt a reaction from Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side. \u201cI don\u2019t think the game is more important for them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to be careful because everything that has happened this week, it is a good game for them to change the switch. They will want to show a different side to what happened in Leipzig and we need to be aware of that.\u201d Pep Guardiola has paid the Belgium international the compliment of saying he would be in the best XI of players he has coached, including at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The City manager, who insisted Sergio Ag\u00fcero was not fit to start, said: \u201cHe would be in there, yes. I was a lucky person. In Barcelona, in Munich and here I train incredible players but if you ask me which is the best keeper I could not answer. It would be disrespectful to another goalkeeper if I choose V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, [Manuel] Neuer or Edi [Ederson] now \u2013 all three are incredible. But Kevin, of course. It\u2019s not necessary to be a brilliant guy and a smart guy and a wise guy to know that Kevin would be there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
