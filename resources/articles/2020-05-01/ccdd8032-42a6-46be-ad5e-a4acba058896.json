One for Australia and two for New Zealand. \u201cThe second they open up New South Wales, I\u2019m going to be like a rat up a drainpipe,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to get in a car and go.\u201d The Australian lawyer has been living in Hong Kong for years, but has been effectively stuck in home town Sydney since January after coronavirus lockdowns turned a short-term contract into an indefinite stay. The closure of international and state borders has scuttled a lot of travel plans for the 35-year-old: Tasmania. South Korea. New York. Greece. France. Now, however, after months of not being able to leave the city, Hackney is looking forward to travelling her own country \u2013 or state \u2013 in earnest. \u201cI\u2019m actually really excited when things relax a bit to go and see Australia, and New Zealand. And while it isn\u2019t necessarily the travel I had wanted or had planned for this year \u2013 it\u2019s not the start of the Tour de France in Nice, it\u2019s not Greece \u2013 it\u2019s the travel I\u2019m getting, and the more I think about it, the more excited I am.\u201d With the anticipation of relaxation of regional, if not state, borders in the near future, there is speculation about what potential there is for a local-led rebound for the hard-hit Australian tourism sector. Australians already constitute a significant majority of the total tourism market. Between day trips and overnight stays, local tourism was worth more than $100bn last year, and had been growing. International travellers, however, spend $45.4bn, or about third of the total market \u2013 a significant shortfall to make up in the event of long-term international border closure. It is in the nearly $65bn that Australians spent overseas last year that Tourism Australia, and others in the sector, see hope for reviving the now dormant industry. And hope may not be misplaced \u2013 polling by the Lowy Institute last week found that 35% of Australians are now less likely to travel internationally than they were before coronavirus, borders open or not. Some analysts have predicted a net gain for Australia. Richard Clarke, a global hotels and leisure analyst at research firm Bernstein, has calculated that Australia could stand to benefit from a closure of international borders, should the spending of Australian international travellers be redirected to domestic travel. He says even if 60% of the amount of money Australians spend overseas is instead spent by travelling within Australia \u2013 as happened in the UK after Brexit \u2013 the total value of spending in the Australian market could end up even. Tourism Australia is attempting to stoke domestic demand with a significant campaign, which included an hour-long live TV special, Live from Aus, on Channel Ten on Friday night, encouraging Australians to start making plans for travelling locally. They expect travel to pick up slowly, with day trips followed by regional and interstate travel. Managing director Phillipa Harrison expects people to be keen to get outdoors, explore nature and do things they\u2019ve missed out on, like dining out. However, even though their own polling suggests that 60% of Australians are keen to travel the country as restrictions ease, Harrison is cautious about assuming the local market will make up for the loss of the international one. There will doubtless be an increase in domestic travel, she says, but \u201cit can\u2019t fill the gap of international business entirely\u201d. Dr David Beirman, a lecturer in tourism management at the University of Technology Sydney, agrees that the losses of the year from bushfires, drought and floods, coupled with the continued border lockdown, will be a hole too deep to plug. \u201cWhichever way you look at it \u2013 even if you are the most optimistic person in the world \u2013 we\u2019ve already lost several months of travel,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year is going to be pretty diabolical, even at the most optimistic assessments.\u201d However, he says, there is opportunity for tourism to bounce at least partially back. \u201cPeople will be stir crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to go somewhere. \u201cHow many people in Sydney go opal mining in Lightning Ridge? Or check out White Cliffs?\u201d he says. \u201cWine tours in the Hunter Valley. Astronomical Tours in Siding Springs. There\u2019s a whole range of experiences that we probably don\u2019t market as effectively as we could.\u201d For some tourism and hospitality operators, business is already showing signs of lifting. Luxury resort and spa in the Blue Mountains, Lilianfels, has already started receiving calls for bookings in June and July. John Fink, the creative director of the Fink Group which includes high-end Sydney restaurants Otto, Bennelong and Firedoor, says many people cannot wait to be able to return to the pleasantries of life. \u201cI\u2019m feeling it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut also, when the word went out that they\u2019re going to start easing restrictions our phones just rang off the hook: \u2018When are you opening?\u2019 \u2018When are you opening?\u2019\u201d Fink\u2019s restaurants predominantly serve local patrons, but a significant minority of guests \u2013 Fink estimates between 10% and 30% depending on the restaurant \u2013 are international. He is confident that as people are finally allowed out of their homes, they will be craving nice experiences, particularly ones where they can connect with friends. Those who haven\u2019t been financially affected by the crisis, he says, will have extra money to spend. \u201cI think Sydney will bounce back,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as everything is safe and everything goes according to plan with the slow easing of restrictions, in the dining scene I can really see Sydney coming back to life.\u201d However, Australia is not just capital cities and hatted restaurants. The regions, particularly tourist towns, have been battered by back-to-back unprecedented crises this year. For the Youth Hostels Association Australia, the crisis has decimated business. The network is reliant on international travellers, who make up two-thirds of their guests. The remaining third is dominated by school and business groups. Just 19 of its 70 hostels are open, catering to a far reduced clientele. The backpacker not-for-profit has put nearly all eligible staff on jobkeeper, stood down others and made redundant yet others still. The regional hostels have fared particularly badly. \u201cWe\u2019re basically bunkering down and really waiting for the borders to open,\u201d says the chief executive, Paul McGrath. While his key market is no longer able to travel to Australia, McGrath is \u201cpretty confident\u201d that domestic travel could make up for the losses of foreign travellers. \u201cPeople are going to want to get out and get into nature or go to the beach,\u201d he says. \u201cJust get out of their suburbs and cities.\u201d YHA is hoping that restrictions on regional travel may lift in time for the July school holidays. If border restrictions ease as winter bites in the southern states, he expects a mass migration to holidays north. If so, they will be encouraging people to support the bush, and marketing to families in earnest for the first time. The organisation is in the process of converting small dormitories into family rooms, as a low-cost option for family travellers. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see a great opportunity \u2013 to capture the attention of families for whom it may have previously been cheaper to go to Bali or Fiji,\u201d he says. And, says McGrath, they will be offering discounts to get people back into their accommodation. \u201cWe will certainly be price driven.\u201d Tourism lecturer Beirman says that YHA is not the only tourism operator likely to be offering deals. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smart consumer, and you have the money, get in early because there\u2019ll be a whole bunch of special deals going on. Regions, hotels, attractions will want to lure people to come to them and I think there\u2019ll be some very good deals in the short term,\u201d he says. However, he says, that discounting won\u2019t last, and travel in Australia may become more expensive in the longer term. \u201cA lot of the tourism businesses which have been making no money for months are going to want to fill back the coffers.\u201d In the meantime, Hackney, who typically has multiple holidays in far-flung destinations a year, is hoping that restrictions are open in time for her parents\u2019 annual holiday to NSW coastal town Forster. \u201cIn the current climate, even something as simple as going to Forster feels like such an immense treat,\u201d she says. Her holidays, she says, will now be slower, more meandering, with a focus on enjoying the things around her. This has been a reset. \u201cThe world has shrunk,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not necessarily in a terrible way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
