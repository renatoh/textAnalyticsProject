I just can't stop thinking about her with all those men - and I'm not sure she's telling the truth even now. I'm 25 and have only had four sexual partners. She is two years older, and I always liked the idea that she was more experienced. But now I wish things were different. It is affecting our sex life. I love her, and wanted to marry her, but this has changed everything. I'm sorry you ever started to play the numbers game, as it means little in the scheme of things and does not reflect the quality of the sexual experiences you both had before you met. Anyway, people rarely tell the truth in this respect because society has a double standard about the \"acceptable\" number of past sexual partners - if a man is \"experienced\", he is often admired, whereas a woman risks being vilified. Feeling jealous of your girlfriend's previous partners is normal, but try not to let it become a destructive force. When you are making love with her, try to focus on pleasurable sensations; that will help you to avoid intrusive thoughts. Remember that every person your girlfriend slept with has contributed to her sexual knowledge and style, and, since you obviously like what happens between you sexually, you should be grateful to them all. Try to view her past experiences - sexual and otherwise - as important stages in the creation of the unique person you adore. \u00b7 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u00b7 Private Lives appears every Thursday.
