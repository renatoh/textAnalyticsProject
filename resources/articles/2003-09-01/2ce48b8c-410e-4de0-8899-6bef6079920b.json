The director of Point Blank, Deliverance and Excalibur happily refuses to oblige. Instead, he says that he is completing Country of My Skull, currently in post-production. But there is no strong sense of resolution to his disarming but slightly scrappy memoir, Adventures of a Suburban Boy. Boorman's sense of story has rarely matched his driving commitment to place. Boorman's strength as a director is an acute sense of location or, rather, of dislocation. He creates environments that leave characters unhinged and stranded, and what they say is never as important as where they are. The Appalachian woodlands and 'empty, arid' Los Angeles become severely disorientating atmospheres to his eye. Even the autobiographical Hope and Glory, revisiting his childhood during the Blitz, made London a strange place, gap-toothed by bombardment. In part, the alienation comes from the way Boorman films interiors like exteriors, and vice versa. In Point Blank, Lee Marvin paces endless Los Angeles corridors: 'His polished brogues,' Boorman recalls, 'beat a death knell on the concrete floor, the rhythm of the reaper.' After Marvin's death, Boorman chose those shoes as a souvenir of the actor. He had the forest in Excalibur lit like a chamber at the heart of an atavistic world, pierced by emerald and mossy light. The tropical temperature in his Amazonian quest, The Emerald Forest, drops whenever anybody speaks, but intensifies as the camera noses through creepers and vines. Only jaguars and rippling snakes seem lithe enough to call this tangled environment home. Boorman's best screenplays make room for the visuals. One of the most effective scenes in the book describes Lee Marvin scything away his lines in Point Blank. The script was so stripped-down that Boorman had to explain that it really would produce a full-length movie. 'You mean,' said the old lady in the MGM timing department, 'there's going to be a lot of leerin' and peerin'?' Boorman learnt to leer and peer in suburban London. Living in semi-detached Carshalton, he grew up in 'a comfortably smug void' among 'people who had lost their way in the world'. Everything was neat, snug - aunts smelt of lily of the valley, everyone stood for the national anthem, and the sofa was shaped like a sunbeam. As a vision of childhood, Boorman's comes close to Dennis Potter's adoring contempt for sweet dreams and false security. In this constricting class-consciousness, the war was a blessed disruption: 'It gave us a myth,' Boorman exults. 'We had found our heroes - ourselves.' He scampered around the bomb sites, collecting shrapnel and, if very lucky, live ammo. He also made for the river at every opportunity - 'In water, the rules are different' - helping on the locks and surviving drowning. No wonder Excalibur remains such a potent image for him. When he allows his subconscious to bid for a house in Ireland's Wicklow Hills, Boorman gets his own river. Swimming naked every day in its glacial waters, he claims they 'washed away the last traces of the suburban boy. I belonged at last.' In terms of the book, this is a shame - accounts of battles with the money men we can all write ourselves, but the excruciating grid of class shame and reclamation is particular and fascinating, whether doing national service and falling foul of MI6, or forging startling documentaries at the patrician BBC. Still, we can always stock up on star stories: here Burt Reynolds explains how he goes cold turkey whenever a relationship ends, while Richard Burton's personality seems hollowed out by going on the wagon. Most startling of all is Marlon Brando naming Michael Winner as his favourite director: 'When I met him, Michael said, \"Mr Brando, you are a great actor, I am not a great director, so please do whatever you like\".' The mythic structure underpinning his work draws heavily on Arthurian myth. It's the latter half of the saga that most attracts him - the tainted heroism and sense of a world running down. His protagonists are men tripped into acknowledging their semi-primitive selves: city slickers flailing in the American backwaters; a father searching for his son among Amazon tribes. They all learn to shave away softness. One of his great youthful pleasures was following Frankie Howerd around the music-hall circuit. It becomes a revealing enthusiasm for a comic who exposed 'his pettiness, his envy, his cowardice, his monumental triviality, his pervasive lust. A man admitting weakness, something we had been taught never to do.' Howerd's culpability becomes a brave and attractive template; Boorman confesses to vulnerability, discloses shame. He describes his father's disabling sneer; carrying smelling salts to conquer his fainting fits when the pressure mounted; the 'bleak feeling of worthlessness' when movies fail. This is hardly a triumphalist memoir, and you suspect the suburban boy is still peering through the lens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
