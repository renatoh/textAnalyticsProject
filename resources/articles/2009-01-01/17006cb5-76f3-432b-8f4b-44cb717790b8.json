The 5-0 thrashing of West Bromwich Albion last night was the 11th game in which Van der Sar has not been beaten and if he keeps out Everton for 72 minutes on Saturday he will break the Football League record of 1,103 minutes, set by Steve Death for Reading in 1979. Should Van der Sar make it 12 consecutive shut-outs he would have the opportunity to topple the British record for all competitive games, established by Chris Woods of Rangers, who went unbeaten for 1,196 minutes in 1986-87. Van der Sar, who has not conceded a league goal since a 2-1 win for Arsenal on 8 November, would need to keep out West Ham United for 75 minutes at Upton Park on Sunday week. \"I have to be happy with it on a personal level but it is a great team effort also,\" said Van der Sar. \"We have had a lot of players injured during this run of games. But Jonny Evans has been fantastic, Rafael [da Silva] has played, [John] O'Shea has come in for Patrice Evra. It just shows the strength of the squad. At the beginning of the season everything was on [Cristiano] Ronaldo, [Wayne] Rooney, [Dimitar] Berbatov and [Carlos] Tevez but you need everything to win trophies. You don't need only your strikers. You need your defenders to be on top of their game. You need a midfield to work hard and track back and I suppose you need a goalkeeper who makes saves once in a while.\" It was a modest assessment from a goalkeeper Rio Ferdinand hailed today as \"the best I have ever played with\". Ryan Giggs paid him the ultimate compliment for any United goalkeeper by describing him as the equal of Peter Schmeichel. \"His calming influence goes right through the team,\" Giggs said of the 38-year-old. \"He is getting better with age. Yes, he has great players in front of him but, when he is called upon, he never makes a mistake.\" Yet, as Van der Sar acknowledged, there have been long spells in virtually every game when he has not been required to make a save. \"The understanding between the defenders and the midfielders is excellent. Sometimes it is so easy to play behind them because they are so good at defending. Everyone compliments each other and that is a great quality also of the manager that he picks players who compliment each other.\" His appreciation of his team-mates could be gauged by the way Van der Sar asked every member of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad to sign Tuesday's match-ball. \"A lot of players get to keep the ball when they score three times so I thought I might as well take it home. I had a couple of records in Holland \u2013 10 games without a goal [for Ajax] and a Champions League record of nine games \u2013 but the main thing for me is that we want to be holding something more important in our hands at the end of the season.\" It is United's parsimonious defending, he believes, that could decide the title rather than how many they score at the other end. \"We [the defence] have got the recognition lately, so maybe opposition teams know now that when they go a goal behind against us it is going to be difficult for them. But we don't feel invincible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
