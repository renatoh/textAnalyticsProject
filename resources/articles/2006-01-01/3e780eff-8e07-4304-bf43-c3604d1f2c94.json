The 57-year-old man, from the West Midlands, was detained on Wednesday and bailed pending further inquiries. He has been suspended from his post at Warley high college of sport, in Oldbury, Sandwell. Councillor Ian Jones, the cabinet member for schools and lifelong learning at Sandwell council, sought to reassure parents in the borough. Mr Jones said: \"Sandwell takes child protection ... very seriously. We not only carry out checks on people coming into our schools but also conduct regular inquiries into the backgrounds of existing employees. \"We have recruited a specialist team to trawl through the details of all 6,500 employees currently working in Sandwell schools, not only teachers but all staff, including cooks, cleaners and caretakers. \"Clearly we will carry out a full investigation into this matter to see if there is anything further we can do to protect the children of Sandwell.\" The school's headteacher, John Martin, said: \"Last year, we introduced an amended and more rigorous recruitment strategy, which is a model of good practice for child protection [and which] adheres to the Bichard recommendations developed in light of the Soham inquiry.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
