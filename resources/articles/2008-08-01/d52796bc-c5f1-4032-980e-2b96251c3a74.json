The biography, which is being re-released as a tie-in, has all the ingredients for a popular period drama: a strong heroine, a jealous rival, an evil husband and a beautiful young knight errant, together with stately homes and outrageous fashions. It's all the more enticing because familiar historical figures wander on set to comment on and partake in the action. The heroine, Georgiana, is an intimate friend of Marie Antoinette and an enemy of William Pitt. She is observed by the novelist Fanny Burney, who found herself with 'the strongest disposition to admire and like her'. Georgiana has frequently been compared to her successor in the Spencer dynasty, Princess Diana. Like the 'Queen of Hearts', the Duchess is cast by her parents into a loveless marriage and survives by becoming a charismatic public figure, capturing the hearts of a nation while privately nursing an eating disorder. In Foreman's account she comes across as lovable and intelligent. At her best she channelled her passion into politics, campaigning publicly and privately for the Whig cause. Unlike most period dramas, this is a fully substantiated story. Even intimate details of Georgiana's sexual life are supported by quotation. The Duchess writes letters as compulsively as the heroine of any epistolary novel. Like Richardson's Clarissa, who dashes off a letter in the back of the carriage as she's snatched away by her abductor, Georgiana scribbles epistles while fleeing to France with an illegitimate pregnancy or confessing her gambling debts to her husband. Despite its appeal as a period kiss-and-tell, Foreman's book has weightier merits that may have been forgotten now that the literary world has come to dismiss the fecund line of saucy-lady biographies it spawned. She portrays the political intrigues with insight and approaches the status of 18th-century women sensitively. Let's hope the film contains the odd bit of political discussion as light relief from the corsets and boudoirs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
