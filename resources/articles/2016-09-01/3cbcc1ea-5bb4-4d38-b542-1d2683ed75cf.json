The result at a vibrant Celtic Park ended City\u2019s 100% start to the season of 10 consecutive victories. Guardiola\u2019s side had to draw level three times in the contest. Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Celtic needed only three minutes to take the lead through Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Fernandinho equalised on 12 minutes before a 20th-minute Raheem Sterling own goal was answered by the same player just before the half-hour. Sixty seconds of the second half had been played when Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 registered his second but Nolito ensured City remained undefeated with a 55th-minute strike. Guardiola said: \u201cMaybe this is a good lesson for our future on the importance of starting well. They scored three goals but didn\u2019t have many chances. We created enough to win the game. When the fourth team in the pot is Celtic you realise immediately how tough it is to qualify for the next round. \u201cThinking about the performance, how they fight, how they tried until the end to win the game, it doesn\u2019t matter about the mistakes, I was so satisfied. We scored three goals away in Europe and created three or four [more] clear chances. That\u2019s the best way to learn. In Europe you can\u2019t concede because they [the opposition] are a machine, they are there to punish you.\u201d City now have a home and away double header against Barcelona who came from behind to beat Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 on Wednesday night. Bar\u00e7a lead the group with six points, City have four, Celtic one and the German side zero \u2013 the last two sides now have their own home-and-away games with each other. Guardiola said he believes qualification could go to the wire and with one of his former clubs up next, he added: \u201cAgainst Bar\u00e7a it will be tough but now we analyse what we did, of course we are now second, we are going to recover well and we have time to think about Bar\u00e7a.\u201d Of the end of the winning sequence Guardiola said: \u201cI didn\u2019t speak about the record with my players. It was not necessary to make \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure they know we are not going to win all the games, not even the best team in the world can do that. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rodgers\u2019 side had lost 7-0 at Barcelona on the first matchday so the manager could take pride in the result. \u201cFor large parts of game we were a real threat,\u201d the Northern Irishman said, before praising the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s a noise I\u2019ve never heard before. When you come here you realise how many players around the world talk about the atmosphere here. When you have Celtic support behind you it really is like a 12th man, they really helped us to produce the performance we did. \u201cCollectively we were very good, how we pressed the game, tactically if [you\u2019re] not organised against this team \u2013 like we\u2019ve seen in the Premier League they can really hurt you. That was a big game from us. Our team and the crowd made it a very difficult night for City.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
