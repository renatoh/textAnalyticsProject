Having scrambled into a pair belonging to the tournament director Michael Ganley, pending the arrival of his own after the first frame, the Londoner trailed 4-2. He even came within a ball of losing 5-3 but came through 5-4 to reach the last 16 of the Welsh Open in Cardiff with a 73 break in the ninth frame. The match lasted only 91 minutes. \"I found myself running round the table, playing at his pace. I couldn't stop myself,\" said White. \"But it was a great match to play in.\" Ronnie O'Sullivan, the world and UK champion, had to win the last two frames to beat the world No47 Ian McCulloch 5-4. A clearance of 132 had given McCulloch a 4-3 lead but he did not pot another ball. \"I didn't have a chance in the last two frames,\" he said. O'Sullivan lost the second and sixth frames because he missed routine pots when in play with half-centuries, and became irritated with the referee Terry Camillieri, a newcomer from Malta who at one stage banged into him. \"He's got to get better or he shouldn't be on the tour,\" said O'Sullivan, who now faces Paul Hunter, last year's runner-up and only a 5-3 winner against Alfie Burden despite having led 4-0. The surprise of the day was a 5-4 defeat of the world No8 Stephen Lee by Brian Morgan, the No33 from Tiptree. Meanwhile Stephen Hendry made back-to-back centuries, 120 and 102, in beating Steve Davis 5-1, and the world No14 Graeme Dott beat the No321 Rory McLeod, a Northampton-born son of Jamaican parents, 5-3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
