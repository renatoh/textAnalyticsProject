Martha Burk stands in the doorway watching over these fresh-faced idealists with an expression that hovers somewhere between concern and admiration. 'After they arrest you, how long do they hold you for?' she asks. 'Five or six hours,' says a young woman whose T-shirt is splattered with red food dye symbolising the blood of innocent civilians caught in the bombing of Iraq. 'And how much does it cost to be released?' Burk asks. 'Fifty dollars,' someone else chips in. 'Are you going to join us?' Burk, whose campaign to force Augusta National golf club, home of the US Masters, to accept a female member, has made her, simultaneously, one of the most admired, reviled and famous women in America, shakes her head. 'Not now,' she says, her voice sounding weary. 'I've got an interview to do.' Suddenly I feel frivolous, having travelled 3,000 miles not to conduct an in-depth analysis of how American youth feels about George W. Bush's decision to lead his country into war but to have a conversation with Martha Burk about the membership rules of a golf club. If I feel frivolous, God only knows how she feels. After all, she's the one who has spent most of her life trying to effect all kinds of social and political change - in abortion law, workplace rights for women, equal pay, the make-up of the US Supreme Court - only to find her efforts sub sumed by a dispute involving a sport about which she knows little, a man she has never met and a golf club she wouldn't dream of joining, not even if they opened a Swiss bank account in her name (which is unlikely). She wishes everyone in the room good luck, then guides me to her nearby office, where I start by asking a question that occurred to me while she was talking to the anti-war campaigners. Aren't there more important things in the world to get worked up about than the conduct of Augusta National golf club? 'There are, and I do,' she says, sharply. Like just about every other journalist on the planet with an interest in golf I've spoken to Martha Burk on the phone numerous times over the past few months. I always found her friendly and droll. In person, she is much more businesslike, brisk almost to the point of bristling. This might have something to do with her punishing schedule. Last night she was in Tallahassee, Florida, speaking to a group of women about Augusta. Today, there are phone calls and interviews about Augusta. No doubt it will be more of the same tomorrow. It's been like this since last summer; from the editorial pages of the New York Times to eight-page pull-outs in Golf magazine; the White House to the Golf Channel; on talk radio, cable sports TV, in the sports sections of newspapers in North America and beyond - it's been all Martha, all the time. No wonder she looks pale and exhausted. I ask if she has any regrets about becoming involved in what is arguably the most socially resonant episode in American sport since Muhammad Ali tore up his letter from the Draft Board. 'The only regret I have is that this has turned into a story about me and Hootie Johnson,' she says. 'It's not. It's about power. It's about the men who run the most powerful corporations in the world - corporate leaders who put out a lot of hot air about valuing diversity, claim to be against discrimination and who take womens' dollars only to then turn round and discriminate against those same women.' Maybe so, but it doesn't take a roomful of scriptwriters to work out why the world has come to believe that what they are watching is nothing more than a verbal punch-up between Martha Burk and Hootie Johnson, the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club. All good stories need a strong supporting cast and this particular story has some stellar bit players. It has Tiger Woods, the most famous sportsman in the world and reigning Masters champion, who can't walk the length of a five-iron without being asked for his views on whether or not Augusta should allow women members. It has virtually every major corporation in America, sev eral of which have been asked to explain why their CEO is a member of a golf club which discriminates against 50 per cent of the people who buy their products. It even has a cameo by George W. Bush, who earlier this year asked the newly appointed US Treasury secretary John Snow to resign from the club before taking up his post. Last (and least) it has J.J. Harper, the self-proclaimed chief of the White Knights chapter of the Ku Klux Klan who, to the immense embarrassment of the club, announced his intention to demonstrate in support of Augusta during this year's Masters, which starts on 10 April. But more than anything a great story requires conflict and it's here, in the shape of its two principal characters, that this story has been blessed. In the one corner stands Burk, the head of the National Council of Women's Organisations, an umbrella body that represents 170 womens' groups across America, from the League of Women Voters to the African-American Women's Clergy Association. In the other stands Johnson, the public face of a golf club which counts many of America's richest men among its membership. She is polished and articulate - a classic Washington DC political activist. He, by his own admission, does not cut a Socratic figure in public debate. She has a long record of campaigning on the side of progressive liberalism. In his few public appearances Johnson, with his slow Southern drawl and unbending views, has come across like one of the bad guys in Mississippi Burning . (The political dynamic between the two is actually more complex. Johnson, who made his money as a banker in South Carolina during the Sixties and Seventies has a strong record of supporting African-American business. 'There's a contradiction there I don't understand, on a personal and professional level,' Burk has said.) It is safe to say the two live in different worlds and would have lived happily ever after had it remained that way. That their paths crossed is entirely down to a newspaper column which appeared just after last year's Masters detailing the efforts of the then chairman of the US Olympic Committee and club member Lloyd Ward to have a woman admitted to its membership. Burk read the column and, incredulous that an iconic institution such as Augusta National operated such a policy, she got approval from the NCWO's board to write to Johnson, pointing out that the companies sponsoring the Masters might not want to be seen as supporting discrimination and asking him if the club intended to invite a woman to join. 'The letter was a very small thing in our view, almost unremarkable,' she tells me. 'It was a private letter. I was expecting a private reply, something along the lines of \"this is under consideration, stay tuned\". We certainly didn't set out to cause this huge stink.' Down at Augusta National the letter's arrival was as welcome as a skunk under the floorboards. Johnson read it, perceived the reference to his sponsors as a blackmail threat and then did what no Augusta chairman had ever done before; he hired a public relations adviser. The advice he received was to go on the offensive. This he did by sending Burk a curt reply, saying he found her inquiry about the club's policy on women members 'offensive and coercive'. Simultaneously, the club issued a three-page press release accusing the NCWO of trying to force change on the Augusta National 'at the point of a bayonet', adding defiantly: 'We do not intend to become a trophy in their display case.' This is the point at which two opposing views of this story emerge. Johnson's supporters insist he had no other option but to confront Burk head-on. 'This woman is a bomb-thrower,' says Jim McCarthy, a 'crisis management consultant' recently hired by the club. 'If you look at her track record it is one of drive-by activism. She attacks prominent individuals and institutions and then relies on the press to do her work for her.' Meanwhile, Burk insists she had no intention of turning the 2003 Masters into a circus. 'Trust me, I didn't have to go looking for the press. They came looking for me.' What is not in dispute, however, is that if Hootie Johnson and the gentlemen of Augusta thought their reputation, their power - and their crisis management consultant - would be enough to scare away a woman such as Martha Burk then they were badly mistaken. Burk was born in Texas in 1941 and - oddly enough - had the childhood nickname 'Hootie'. She went to the University of Texas, married young, had children and lived the life of a housewife - an experience she has described as the most radicalising of her life. 'It's an unhealthy model both for the kids and for the mother. It forced isolation for women in that situation ... I knew there was something wrong with this picture,' she told the New Yorker magazine. She had the chance to flex her newly found radicalism during the anti-war era of the late Sixties and Seventies, and later in the Eighties, during the abortion battles that dominated the social debate in America during the Reagan era. By then, she had gone back to university and earned a doctorate in psychology, had married again and made a fortune in computers. Her second husband, a university professor called Ralph Estes, had asked her to help develop a computer program for high school football games - an ultimately fruitless venture but one that helped her develop expertise which she then used to create hugely successful educational software. In 1986, Burk and Estes moved to Wichita, Kansas, where she became the local head of the National Organisation for Women - an experience which gave her the taste for full-time politics. Four years later, the couple moved to Washington DC, where they established a think-tank called the Centre for Advancement of Public Policy. In 2000, Burk ran for election as the head of the NCWO. Unlike previous occupants of the post, who ran the organisation part-time while also doing their day job, Burk promised to take it on full-time, for no pay. As one magazine pointed out, she has just the kind of go-getting, self-starting, success-ridden CV that an investment banker like Hootie Johnson might respect. In a story filled with ironies, perhaps none is greater than the fact that one of the world's wealthiest sporting institutions, which earns (and spends) millions every year hosting one of golf's four majors, has been brought to public ridicule by an organisation which has an annual budget of $300,000 and gets by on four staff operating out of an office the caddies at Augusta might complain is too cramped. 'The people who support the club are always trying to minimise what we are doing, trying to make us look as if we are smaller and less effective than we are. The truth is that we are one of the largest organisations of this kind in the country. We represent millions of women,' says Burk. However, even she would concede that before the Augusta issue arose the NCWO was not a significant presence in the national media. It's not difficult to work out why. In recent months Burk has been lobbying both the Pentagon - in an effort to make sure female sub-contractors get a fair share of the post-11 September reconstruction work - and Nasa, to protest at its decision to stop manufacturing space suits in small sizes, thus making it less likely that women will have the opportunity to become astronauts: worthy subjects, but not the raw material from which front pages are fashioned. Does she resent the fact that efforts such as these have gone largely unnoticed while her argument with Augusta National receives blanket coverage? 'I understand why it has happened. This story has got sex, money, power, sport, and that's what people care about. What men care about - and it is mostly men who are reporting this story,' she says. 'Yes, I would be delighted to sit here and talk to you about the lack of decent welfare provision for under-privileged families. But that's not what you want to do, is it?' As it happens, she was due to brief members of Congress later in the day about proposed cuts in benefits to poorer families. The meetings were cancelled because of the war, which gave her a chance to catch up with the arrangements for her demonstrations at Augusta during Masters week. With less than two weeks before the first tee shot is struck, the details remained sketchy. Her request to place a dozen protesters outside the golf club's gates, along with 200 across the street, has been turned down by the city mayor. 'Given the number of people who are are going to be there anyway we thought this wasn't an unreasonable request but they said we would be a traffic hazard. They offered us a spot on some property half-a-mile away that is owned by the club,' she explains. 'We believe this is a breach of our constitutional rights so we're taking them to court. We're not trying to disrupt the tournament, all we are trying to do is make our point. Believe me, if Augusta was excluding African-Americans, none of this would be happening - this entire problem would have been settled on day one.' Regardless of what happens in court, Burk will be in Augusta next week along with Tiger, Hootie, the KKK and anyone else who cares to show up. Her enemies have called the head of the NCWO many things - power-mad trollop, self-aggrandising fool, bra-burning man-hater, to name just three of the more printable ones - but none has questioned her commitment to the cause. Augusta National has spent most of the past nine months hiding behind off-the-record briefings, while many of the world's leading players have offered up the blandest 'don't ask me I'm just a golfer' and the US PGA Tour (which bans the staging of sanctioned tournaments at clubs which discriminate on grounds of race or gender) has cravenly usurped its rules to accommodate Augusta. By contrast, Burk hasn't flinched from any challenge, partly, one senses, because she thrives on political argument but mostly because on the one simple question at the core of this debate - does Augusta National, as a private institution, have a legal right to invite whoever it likes to become a member? - she believes she is absolutely right. 'For one thing, I would dispute that Augusta is a private institution. If it was, it would be conducting its business out of the public view. It would not be running a very public golf tournament, it would not be selling merchandise to the public, it would not be on the public airwaves or welcoming any kind of public exposure. 'Legally, it may be a private club - though that is open to debate - but morally I believe they should open their club to women.' But doesn't she accept the notion, put forward by her opponents, that on occasion men prefer to socialise with men, and women like to socialise with women? 'I'm not asking that the locker rooms be open. I'm not even asking that they play golf together. If men want to socialise together, I don't have any objection. But they should do it in private social groups, not this kind of high-profile corporate venue. In any case, who really believes Augusta National is about socialising? Socialising is friends getting together on a Friday night. This club has a worldwide membership that comes in twice a year. That's not socialising, it's big business.' In her public appearances, Burk likes to say that regardless of what happens next week, she has won her argument. She's right. Never again will it be a glad, confident, testosterone-only morning amongst the azaleas. The same goes for the world of golf, or at least those parts of it which continue to operate under the misguided belief that sport in the twenty-first century has any place for sex discrimination. Augusta National may not accept a women member before the 2003 Masters but sometime this year, once Hootie Johnson is satisfied he has made his point, it will. The same goes for the golfing establishment in Britain, the Royal and Ancient. Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wrote to the R&amp;A last month, urging it to set a 'positive example' on discrimination, a stance Burk publicly backed. So this year's British Open at the men-only Royal St George's will be as much about sex discrimination as about golf, unless the R&amp;A both welcomes women members and announces it will no longer stage the world's oldest major at clubs that practise discrimination. These are tumultuous days for the sport and it's not an exaggeration to say that most of the credit (or blame, if you're that way inclined) for this can be laid at the feet of Martha Burk. But why did it take a 62-year-old Texan who gave up on the game after one abortive round as a teenager to start such a revolution. 'Because golf, and in particular Augusta National, has no power over someone like me. They can't get me fired, they can't take away my salary, they can't take away my sponsorship and they can't punish me by keeping me out of a tournament like the Masters,' says the scourge of the buffers at the clubhouse bar. 'You see, I really don't care about the Masters and these men and their games of golf.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
