After a stormy three hour debate, MPs rejected a Lords amendments calling for a \"sunset clause\" on the prevention of terrorism bill and on raising the burden of proof needed for imposing so-called 'control orders'. The government also won with a majority of 108 its key concession - that judges would approve all forms of control order, from full house arrest to phone and internet restrictions and travel curtailments. Peers will have to decide tomorrow whether to continue defying the elected Commons over the legislation, or begin a bitter round of Parliamentary ping-pong by insisting on the changes. A day of high drama at Westminster began with Tony Blair at PMQs challenging the Tories to back new anti-terrorism powers, or \"irresponsibly\" oppose them in the teeth of advice from the police and security services. Tory leader Michael Howard angrily retorted: \"I have come to the conclusion that you want this Bill to fail. You want to pretend that you are the only one who is tough on terrorism.\" After peers imposed five diluting amendments to the governments proposals over the past two days in a bitter tussle between Labour, the Tories, the Lib Dems - and between the Commons and the Lords itself - the home secretary announced last night he was willing to compromise on allowing judges to approve all forms of control orders, and for parliament to review the legislation annually. In today's debate the shadow home secretary David Davis condemned the bill as a \"strange test of political machismo\", and warned Mr Clarke that being \"clumsy on terrorism is not the same as tough on terrorism.\" Mr Davis said the Tory position was that the bill required a complete rethink. The government's proposal of an annual debate rather than a sunset clause was inadequate because such events tended to result in ratification rather than revaluation, he argued. MPs on all sides complained that today's debate was limited to just three hours - and effectively on a completely new bill from the one they voted on last week, since Mr Clarke had offered his concessions in the Lords, and the peers themselves had imposed five major amendments. Mr Clarke came under fire from a strong pincer movement from former Tory home secretary and Labour QC backbencher Bob Marshall-Andrews. Mr Marshall-Andrews branded the home secretary's assurances about judicial review \"legal heresy\", whilst Mr Clarke ridiculed the idea that the judiciary would be in a position to question the home secretary's judgement, despite having official approval of an order. Former home office minister John Denham said the government should reconsider moves such as allowing intercept evidence in trials, or instituting a new offence of 'acts preparatory to terrorism', in order to deal with terrorist suspects, since tonight's bill would probably stay on the statute book \"for 10 or 15 years.\" Labour loyalist Sion Simon spoke up for the bill, saying the vast majority of people in the country - unlike lawyers in the Commons chamber - supported it, but Labour leftwinger Diane Abbott said \"the run up to the general election is the worst time to bring in legislation of this kind\" and urged her fellow MPs to vote for the Tories' sunset clause. Labour MP and QC Vera Baird said suspects should be allowed to choose a specialist lawyer from a list and that lawyer should then be allowed to discuss the case with them. Mr Clarke said it was \"perfectly appropriate\" for both of those things to happen. Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten said suspects should be able to hear the case against them - even on closed courts sessions dealing with intelligence evidence. But Mr Clarke insisted that his proposals protected civil liberties more fully than similar anti-terror powers passed by previous governments. Ministers now face a desperate battle to get the legislation onto the statute book before current powers to detain suspects without charge in Belmarsh prison expire on Monday. However, Mr Clarke disclosed that an amendment would allow him to make a non-derogating control order against the Belmarsh detainees, subject to referring it to the court for confirmation. Holding foreign terrorist suspects was deemed an illegal abuse of human rights by the Law Lords in December and the measures in the bill are aimed to provide an acceptable alternative. Peers gave the current legislation a three-day mauling and look set to keep fighting when the bill returns to the Lords. Last week the government's majority was slashed to just 14 as it narrowly avoided an embarrassing defeat over the role of judges - one of the elements Mr Clarke has now backed down on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
