While Christians (Anglicans, Catholics and others) made up 43.8% of the population, the Nones represented 48.5%, almost double the 25% describing themselves this way in the 2011 census. While obviously there are also other religions, the report (\u201cContemporary Catholicism in England and Wales\u201d by Stephen Bullivant, due to be launched in the House of Commons next week) focuses on the rising indifference towards Christianity, and the failure of the churches to retain people who were brought up as Christians \u2013 a switch also reflected in statistics from Scotland and, to a lesser extent, Northern Ireland. All interesting to someone like me who\u2019s never been religious \u2013 heavily lapsed CofE at best. Nor have I ever been aggressively atheist: unless the way a belief system is practised becomes extreme, unfair and affects others, it seems entirely people\u2019s own business. Now it seems I am something, even if that carries the unlovely tag of a None. Otherwise, where Christianity is concerned, I flip-flop all over the place: one minute, cheered by Justin Welby speaking up for the poor; the next, frustrated by Catholicism\u2019s ongoing stance on Aids and condoms. But that\u2019s just me. What\u2019s interesting is that so many others seem to have arrived at None in their own way, for their own reasons, even, as this report says, after childhoods far more formally religious than mine. What are they moving towards \u2013 or moving away from? Perhaps the oft-cited arguments in favour of Christianity \u2013 that it encourages a sense of community \u2013 seem a tad overplayed in modern times. However people police their behaviour these days, it\u2019s more likely to be secularist/humanist-tinged \u2013 a basic respect for others \u2013 than actively religious. Moreover, even the most isolated individual is likely to have access to the \u201ccommunity\u201d of television, phone and internet \u2013 far from ideal, but, if you\u2019re not religious, neither is sitting in a draughty hall with a Bible group and a digestive biscuit. I wonder if these statistics could be even lower. While I know some genuine churchgoers, in my experience there\u2019s also a thriving subculture of parents mysteriously \u201cfinding religion\u201d to get their children into superior church schools. I\u2019m not judging these parents (so far as I\u2019m concerned, anything goes in the school crapshoot), but the point must be made that the only thing they truly \u201cbelieve\u201d in is getting their children through their GCSEs. Then there are those thankfully rare types whose behaviour could put people off Christianity altogether. Recently, the late Christopher Hitchens was accused (by a US religious opponent) of having undergone a deathbed conversion, with doubts about his own atheist stance. This claim (swiftly rebuffed by his widow) could be said to have undermined Hitchens\u2019s credibility. Let\u2019s hope that it was an honest mistake \u2013 it would be disappointing if certain religious people, usually the first to demand respect and civility, were perceived to trample so carelessly upon the reputations of those who oppose them. To me, a None, this partly explains the membership crisis facing Christianity in this country. At present, the church makes scheduled appearances in people\u2019s lives only at times of high drama (birth, marriage, death), and has also become part of the desperate scramble for a free decent education. Certainly, if deathbed panic and school admission frenzy have become big recruitment opportunities (different methods of \u201cscaring up\u201d new believers), then it shows how bad things are. Surely, if you\u2019re so inclined, religion should be a life choice, not a lifestyle one. Perhaps what this report reflects is how Christianity is in danger of losing its relevance for British people in their daily lives, where it might really matter. It all could have been so different, David\u2026 I mean, Ed On Question Time last Thursday, Ed Miliband was twice called \u201cDavid\u201d by fellow panellist, novelist Dreda Say Mitchell. Ed took it well, but it must have smarted. It\u2019s been a while since the Milibands\u2019 Cain and Abel political fratricide show was big box-office, but anyone who thought that Ed shafted his older brother must have enjoyed this latest karmic instalment. Not only did Ed\u2019s sibling eclipse of his older brother fail to materialise when he was Labour leader, with everyone constantly muttering about him being the \u201cwrong\u201d Miliband, but all these years on he\u2019s still publicly addressed as \u201cDavid\u201d. With all that\u2019s happened (ahem), I wonder whether Ed sometimes lapses into a reverie, where an alternative life unfolds. He steps nobly aside for photogenic David, a man who could perhaps be trusted to eat a bacon sandwich. Then, maybe Labour wins, and Ed enjoys a high-flying political career as chancellor, foreign secretary, or whatever was decided when he fell on the leadership sword. That wouldn\u2019t have been a bad career trajectory \u2013 better, anyway, than being called \u201cDavid\u201d on Question Time, not once but twice. If such thoughts don\u2019t occasionally niggle Ed, he must be made of concrete. No more Bonds, please \u2013 kill him off Please tell me that we\u2019ve reached peak-Bond speculation. I couldn\u2019t care less if Daniel Craig has tired of playing him, or whether actor Tom Hiddleston had brunch with director Sam Mendes. Which might, however, mean it\u2019s looking less likely that there could be a genuinely interesting casting decision, resulting in a black Bond, female Bond, or whatever. Instead, the result looks set to be \u2026 a prominent white male actor. \u201cGood heavens!\u201d we\u2019ll cry, \u201cWho saw that coming?\u201d Whoever lands the role, it\u2019s probable that Bond would still be played straight, and would still pump out the kind of male ultra-hetero wish-fulfilment malarkey that makes old Benny Hill sketches resemble feminist manifestos. Fast brum-brums, supposedly futuristic gadgets that all look as if they fell out of a mid-range Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas cracker, and let\u2019s not forget the ladeez! \u2013 all those \u201chot babes\u201d who don\u2019t seem to mind being killed, so long as they get to spend time snuggling up to Bond\u2019s artfully teased chest hair. Although I\u2019ve always found Bond deeply irritating, akin to having an intermittently buzzing bluebottle trapped inside British culture, the nadir was hit hit in Skyfall, where a female character with a glass of whisky on her head was executed, and Bond quipped: \u201cA waste of a good Scotch.\u201d If something was being squandered, it wasn\u2019t a tumbler of Macallan, it was Craig\u2019s acting chops and dignity. Now Craig is leaving Bond behind, it seems, taking his over-snug swimming trunks with him, but the Bond bore-a-thon looks set to rumble ingloriously on, to the point where it\u2019s rather embarrassing having this tuxedo-clad troglodyte dominate the film landscape. Instead of endlessly speculating about who is going to play Bond, how about a referendum about how to kill him off?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
