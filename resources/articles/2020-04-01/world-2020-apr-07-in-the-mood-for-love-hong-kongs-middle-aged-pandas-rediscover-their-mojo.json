Ying Ying and Le Le have been at Ocean Park since 2007 but, despite the encouragement of zookeepers, they had shown little inclination to have sex while daily hordes of visitors were watching their every move. Chinese scientists, after losing patience with natural breeding, extracted sperm from Le Le and artificially inseminated Ying Ying, but this resulted in miscarriages. When the pandemic forced the closure of the park on 26 January, the 14-year-olds were halfway through the panda\u2019s average lifespan and almost a decade past the start of sexual maturity. But, after more than two months of being alone together, the couple have recently shown signs they were in the mood for love. Local reports say Ying Ying \u2013 in her oestrogen cycle \u2013 spent more time in the water and Le Le left more scent markings around the enclosure. On Monday morning, the pair were seen cuddling more intensely than usual and then finally did what comes naturally, much to the delight of park managers. \u201cThe successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,\u201d Michael Boos, executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, noted in a press release. It is not yet clear if Li Li is pregnant but vets say hormone fluctuations and behavioural changes may give a clue by late June. \u201cWe hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year,\u201d Boos said. He said a panda cub would contribute to the conservation of a vulnerable species. Once the lockdown ends, such a popular draw could also rescue the tourist resort, which has recently reported financial difficulties. The commercially-oriented park made no mention of the likelihood that the pandas were finally able to breed thanks to reduced stress from intrusive crowds. Instead it said the animals\u2019 \u201csuccess\u201d was attributable to years of \u201ctrial and learning\u201d, and the collaboration of experts from the Hong Kong park and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong. Zoologists have long argued the panda\u2019s reputation for a low sex drive was misleading because it was based solely on captive animals. \u201cThe problems often attributed to them \u2013 short penises, narrow vaginas and low sex drives \u2013 are not an issue in the wild,\u201d Jim Harkness, a panda expert and the former China representative for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said. \u201cIt is a phoney issue to say that pandas face a breeding crisis that we have to solve.\u201d He said the best way to protect the endangered species was to extend its habitat in the wild."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
