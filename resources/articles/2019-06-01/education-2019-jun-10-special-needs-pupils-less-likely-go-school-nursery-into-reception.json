A study by the London School of Economics and Political Science found more than a quarter (26%) of children with a statement of Send move from the school where they attended nursery to another school for reception, compared with 18% of children with no recorded Send. The findings will fuel parents\u2019 concerns that some schools \u2013 under pressure because of funding cuts and accountability measures \u2013 are reluctant to admit children with Send after nursery and are directing them to other schools. Some ethnic minority groups were found to be similarly affected. A quarter (25%) of black Caribbean children who attend a school nursery move schools for reception, compared with 17% of white British and 12% of Bangladeshi children. Researchers said further investigation was needed to find out why. The research, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, looked at the progression of more than half a million children born in the 2006-07 academic year from school nursery classes to reception. While it acknowledges some pupils may move to more appropriate provisions for their formal school years, it says such a move can be particularly disruptive for some children with Send. \u201cThere is also evidence that some schools discourage (more or less explicitly) the attendance and admission to reception of children with complex needs, resulting in them moving to alternative institutions,\u201d it adds. The plight of children with Send who are out of school or unable to secure the specialist support to which they are legally entitled has gained national attention in recent months, amid claims of a Send funding and provision crisis. The study\u2019s lead author, Dr Kitty Stewart, an associate professor of social policy and associate director of LSE\u2019s Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion, said: \u201cThere are aspects of the way early education policy is currently working that are increasing rather than narrowing inequalities between children. \u201cRecent policy reforms, such as the 30-hour policy for children of working parents, alongside a squeeze on funding for services like Sure Start, are likely to be making these inequalities worse. Government urgently needs to review its provision with a sharper focus on ensuring that all children get the best start in life.\u201d The report, Inequalities in the experience of early education in England: Access, peer groups and transitions, warns that recent funding cuts and reforms have reduced local authorities\u2019 capacity to take action to understand and address inequalities in early years provision. It recommends that local authorities should be given the power and resources to address higher levels of transitions between schools for children with statements and some minority ethnic groups. Dr Tammy Campbell, one of the authors of the study, said: \u201cFunding cuts combined with target-based school accountability measures mean that schools are disincentivised from admitting these pupils. We intend to track changes over recent years in upcoming research.\u201d Responding to the LSE research, the children and families minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: \u201cThe school admissions code is clear that children with Send cannot be refused a place in a mainstream school on the grounds of having Send and the Children and Families Act 2014 reinforces the rights of children with Send to attend mainstream schools. \u201cLocal authorities are required to have inclusion funds for all three- and four-year-olds with Send who are taking up early education entitlements. These funds are intended to support local authorities to work with providers to address the needs of individual children with Send.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
