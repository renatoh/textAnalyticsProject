You know, this young, influential band from America with this interesting, strange sound. I don't think it's going to happen in the way you'll never get another Ramones.\" He chuckles. \"But I'm happy to take those compliments.\" Gatesmith was just eight when the Strokes released their debut, Is This It, but he is sharp enough to realise there could be worse comparisons. And that they are inevitable, given Howler's sound and the fact that they are signed to the label that spotted the Strokes, Rough Trade. As Gatesmith tells it, the coupling came about when a journalist, who had just interviewed Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis about the 10th anniversary of Is This It, saw Howler playing in their hometown of Minneapolis and sent Travis a demo on the off chance he might like it. \"And he did!\" exclaims Gatesmith, who seems delighted to be on the seminal English imprint. \"Stiff Little Fingers, man, that's the way to start a label,\" enthuses the teenager, breaking into a sprightly and not unimpressive a capella rendition of the Irish punk\u2011band's 1978 debut single, Suspect Device. Their closest current peers are the Vaccines, who took them on tour last year, and, like the British band, Howler unashamedly raid rock history to create their punky, poppy sound. They ransack everything from 1960s handclaps to 1950s-style twangs. The terrific Told You Once steals the riff from Elvis Presley's (Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame, as the Smiths' Johnny Marr once did for Rusholme Ruffians. \"I love those things,\" Gatesmith says. \"When I started Howler I was into early-50s R&amp;B, proto rock'n'roll.\" A particular favourite was Roy Brown's swinging Butcher Pete, which he found in a bargain bin. \"It was recorded in 1949 or something, but it's the most rock'n'roll thing I've ever heard.\" Gatesmith made the journey to Howler via a succession of preposterously titled combos. Total Babe \u2013 still, seemingly, better known in Minneapolis than Howler \u2013 were \"really fun, a bit Belle and Sebastian or Camera Obscura. Girl singer. Just think twee. We had a violin\u2026\" And A-Cups? \"The stupidest thing I've ever been a part of,\" he says. \"Actually, no, Gay Animals was the stupidest thing. Just a bunch of noise. I was trying to find my voice, really. I tried a bit of folk because I like Tom Waits and Bob Dylan. Nothing was really clicking until I wrote the song This One's Different for what turned out to be Howler. I was 17, it just came out of my head and I thought: 'Oh, this is what I should be doing.'\" He hasn't quite grown up, nor should he. Howler's lyrics are a hoot, teeny tales of driving stolen cars into rivers and bonkers Oedipal fantasies. \"I'm a mischievous kind of guy,\" he shrugs. Their gigs feature \"a tight band who are very loud, with lots of feedback\" and who will not outstay their welcome. \"That line 'I wanna die young as a star' isn't me saying that personally,\" he explains. \"I have a concept of what a band's life should be. Maybe this is me being naive and 19, but I think it should be three or four albums. People go on for years now and I hate it. The Libertines did two of my favourite albums and burned out. I kinda like that legacy: we grow up and Howler remains these youthful little shitheads \u2013 we won't be reforming in our 40s.\" America Give Up is released on Rough Trade on 16 January. Howler tour the UK from 23 January. Details: howlerband.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
