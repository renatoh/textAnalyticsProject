So far, the highest earning instalment in the fantasy series is the one that started it all - 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - which sold $614m (\u00a3356m) in tickets outside North America. The third chapter, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, grossed $540m (\u00a3313m) following its summer 2004 release and many expect Goblet of Fire to soar past this mark. The fourth episode sold more than $85m (\u00a350m) worth of tickets in 19 countries outside North America in its first weekend, bringing its total haul to more than $187.5m (\u00a3110m). Historically, the Harry Potter pictures dominate the charts for several weeks and executives at Warner Bros predict Goblet of Fire will demonstrate strong legs. This weekend Potter IV goes on wide release in Italy, Spain, Brazil and Japan, among others, and will almost certainly remain the top picture around the world. It grossed $102m (\u00a360m) last weekend in North America and should hold well as Americans begin celebrating the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend later today. The powerhouse international showing demonstrates the growing importance of the collective non-US markets. International box office has traditionally trailed North America by some margin; however in recent years the roles have reversed. These days North American ticket sales account for a mere one-third of a Hollywood picture's worldwide box office and studio chiefs rarely greenlight a major project without considering its potential appeal beyond borders. \"Harry Potter's success is good for all of us,\" one US distributor from a rival studio said. \"When the genre does well abroad it offers more incentive at home to push this kind of storytelling through the pipeline.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
