There\u2019s no other meeting like Ascot, so I\u2019m glad if I can still be a part of it.\u201d Ward has saddled 10 winners at Royal Ascot in all, registering his first success in 2009 with Strike The Tiger, a 33-1 chance, in the Windsor Castle Stakes. He drew a blank at the five-day meeting in 2019 for the first time since 2012, but Kimari, a two-year-old filly, ran an excellent race to finish second behind Raffle Prize in the Queen Mary Stakes and she is one of two older horses that Ward hopes to send over from his Kentucky base next month. \u201cI had some [British] staff that worked for me over the winter here and went home a few months ago,\u201d Ward says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be there to accept the horses, so that\u2019s worked perfect. Kimari came back from that effort last year and won at Saratoga [in August], then she won a stakes at Keeneland and in the Breeders\u2019 Cup [at Santa Anita] she was a troubled fourth. \u201cShe won her first prep race back [at Oaklawn in early April] and she\u2019s shown she\u2019s very versatile. At Ascot last year it was raining heavily and she put up a big performance, but she enjoyed firm ground as well at Saratoga. She\u2019s sound and ready to go and she\u2019ll be pointed towards the [Group One] Commonwealth Cup.\u201d Bound For Nowhere, already a veteran of the transatlantic crossing having lined up at Ascot in both 2018 and 2019, is also being aimed at a return. \u201cHe pulled a muscle up high last year [when down the field in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes] and it took quite a bit of time to get him back,\u201d Ward says. \u201cThen he had a big win in his final race of the year at Belmont, he ran a big race at Santa Anita in his Ascot prep when he was beaten on the line and he\u2019s had some eye-opening breezes. So look out for him as well.\u201d Seven of Ward\u2019s Ascot winners have been two-year-olds, most of them showing the irresistible early pace that has become something of a trademark for his juvenile runners at the meeting. Keeneland\u2019s spring meeting, however, was abandoned due to a lockdown in Kentucky to combat coronavirus, and while Ward moved some of his string to Gulfstream Park in Florida, it has not been easy to sort out a pecking order among the two-year-olds. \u201cI\u2019d ordinarily train on grass but we had to switch to dirt because that\u2019s the only option in south Florida,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they haven\u2019t come out running like they have in years past, but I expect this week actually, starting tomorrow [Thursday, when Tequila Queen runs at Churchill Downs] to have some big efforts from my two-year-olds. \u201cTo have valid entries for Royal Ascot, they have to perform accordingly, and you know how two-year-olds are, they have to go into these races and win with authority but also have to come out of the races well, so we\u2019ll have to see on both sides of that. The timeframe we have, it\u2019s getting smaller for Ascot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
