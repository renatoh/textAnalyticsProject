The students were sanctioned over a series of comments made on a WhatsApp group, including racial epithets and messages such as: \u201cIf you ain\u2019t English, go home,\u201d \u201cbomb the mosques\u201d and \u201cwe need a race war\u201d, according to screengrabs posted online by a fellow student, Arsalan Motavali. There have been increasingly vociferous calls for racism to be tackled in UK universities and Motavali said he had been moved to act after reading about allegations at another institution. He said he created the \u201cDodgy Blokes Soc\u201d WhatsApp group last summer for use by a small group of students attached to the Bracton Law Society \u2013 the largest student society at Exeter. But its content became \u201cincreasingly racist and deplorable\u201d over time and he began to document the worst examples. Among them, he said, were cases in which students backed a policy of racial discrimination and joked about buying slaves from African countries, as well as about gang rape. Besides the university\u2019s investigation, the revelations prompted an anti-racism rally, at which students expressed their concerns about the \u201crecent vile racist and misogynistic comments\u201d and the \u201csystemic issues\u201d behind them. Motavali and two fellow anti-racist activists at the University of Exeter, Chris Omanyondo and Roman Ibra, told the Guardian: \u201cThese incidents are happening all the time but they are not all visible. There will be other group chats and other incidents of intimidation but we will not always see the prejudice.\u201d There have been past incidents at that institution and students have highlighted others on campuses across the country, including a slave auction that was advertised at Loughborough University and racial abuse written on bananas belonging to a black student at the University of Warwick. Last week, a University of Oxford student, Benedict Aldous, was selected for the boat race even though he was banned from social events at his college for wearing a Ku Klux Klan costume to a party. Aldous said he had meant no offence by wearing the costume. He said: \u201cIt was meant as a comment to Donald Trump\u2019s possible connections to KKK members. I did not intend to offend anyone and removed the costume within two minutes of arriving.\u201d On Tuesday, a University of Exeter spokesman said: \u201cFollowing reports of allegations involving a small group of students, the university launched a major investigation, in conjunction with the students\u2019 guild. This investigation has now concluded and the outcomes have included expulsions, suspensions and other significant sanctions. These outcomes are subject to appeal.\u201d He said the institution was not willing to tolerate \u201cany form of racist, sexist or bigoted behaviour and is committed to eradicating any instances of discrimination and harassment that may arise\u201d. It was reported that five students were initially suspended from the university over the incident but Exeter refused to say how many had been expelled, suspended or subject to another form of sanction. Nor would it say whether any had escaped sanction altogether. Its statement added: \u201cThe university has established a new provost commission, which has a broad remit to recommend and implement new approaches, initiatives, programmes and policies which will ensure we work continually towards an open, diverse and safe university community for all our students, staff and visitors, under the banner of \u201cWe are all Exeter\u201d. It will seek to eradicate racism and all forms of harassment and discrimination from our campuses.\u201d When news of the incident first broke, the university said the police had been informed. Devon and Cornwall police said at the time that officers were aware of the allegations and were liaising with the university. The force was unable to say on Tuesday evening what action, if any, it had taken since."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
