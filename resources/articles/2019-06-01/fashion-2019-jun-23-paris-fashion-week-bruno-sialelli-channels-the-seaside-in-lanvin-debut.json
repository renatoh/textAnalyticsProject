For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene. \u201cI love my job,\u201d he said backstage after the show, \u201cbut the holidays is always the best part of our lives and I wanted to express something very bright and playful and [capture] this idea of travelling.\u201d His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli \u2013 who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe \u2013 is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory. In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with \u201cbringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,\u201d and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear. As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked to the life and travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration. This manifested in a mash-up of fabrications, including intarsia knitwear \u2013 like tapestries depicting seascapes she would have picked up and brought home \u2013 and beaded embellishment, such as trinkets she might have found in a bazaar. The theme of holiday paved way for nautical stripes \u2013 in knitwear and seersucker suiting \u2013 and sailor collars. Straw holiday hats (the dodgy kind) had hand embroidered Lanvin motifs; and bags were the colour of an orange buoy. Mermaid (taken from Lanvin\u2019s antique taps), shell and starfish prints made repeat appearances, while a series of reinterpreted beer-mat prints ticked the ironic box that\u2019s proven an undeterrable trend of late. There\u2019s a new mood to the house that reflects both Sialelli\u2019s youth and experience. His former employer, Loewe, is a venerable lifestyle brand as much as it is a fashion house, with its artistic collaborations and references central to its appeal. For this show, Sialelli channelled the same stimuli, not least with the invitation which was a limited-edition print by the artist and rising star Luke Edward Hall featuring four men in Lanvin-blue swim trunks. Sialelli, however, is targeting a younger audience than his last house; as a concept, this was more first freedom than established culture vulture. He said backstage that he wanted to \u201cexpress something easy and cool and French\u201d with his team who \u201care excited about working with new languages\u201d and, with this, he is heading in the right direction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
