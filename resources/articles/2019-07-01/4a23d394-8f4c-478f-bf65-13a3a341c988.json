Boris Johnson\u2019s new-look cabinet includes Sajid Javid as chancellor and Priti Patel as home secretary among an array of prominent Brexiteers to receive top jobs. Dominic Raab is foreign secretary and first secretary of state, while arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg was made leader of the Commons. Michael Gove is moved to become the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and replaced as environment secretary by fellow Brexiter Theresa Villiers. Johnson\u2019s brother Jo is appointed minister of state at the department for business, energy and industrial strategy and the department for education. Gavin Williamson becomes education secretary, while Andrea Leadsom becomes business secretary, Ben Wallace is defence secretary, Liz Truss is named international trade secretary to the Treasury, and Robert Jenrick is secretary of state for housing, communities and local government. Grant Shapps becomes transport secretary and Stephen Barclay, Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd keep their jobs as Brexit secretary, health secretary and work and pensions secretary respectively. Former chief whip Julian Smith has been appointed Northern Ireland secretary, Alister Jack becomes Scottish secretary, and Alun Cairns will remain Welsh secretary. James Cleverly becomes the Conservative party chair, while Rishi Sunak enters the cabinet as Treasury chief secretary. Robert Buckland QC is appointed lord chancellor and justice secretary and Nicky Morgan becomes secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport. Along with the resignations, more than half of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet are no longer in their roles. From The Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart: From BBC\u2019s Newsnight: In perhaps the most dramatic appointment of the evening, arch Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, was made leader of the Commons. Unusually, Downing Street said he would not be a full member of the cabinet, although he will attend cabinet meetings. From BBC\u2019s Newsnight: Mark Francois, deputy chair of the European Research Group, says Boris Johnson should get straight to the point with the EU and set up talks on free trade, something the EU has repeatedly said it would not do without a withdrawal agreement and a deal on the Irish border, EU citizens and the divorce bill. Francois told ITV\u2019s Peston programme: \u201cThe withdrawal agreement is dead. We\u2019re not to try and revive that \u2026 pointless on either side to do that. What makes sense it to cut to the chase and go straight to the trade deal a la super-Canada.\u201d From BBC\u2019s Newsnight: Former culture minister Ed Vaizey says the country should brace itself for no deal after today\u2019s brutal cabinet reshuffle. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite clear that Boris will go for no deal. He\u2019s got some formidable people with him in No 10 to achieve that objective,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Peston programme. \u201cThe trouble for people like me face [who are opposed to no deal] is if it goes through and it is bad news, we will still get the blame. The Brexiters hold all the cards and they are very adept at blaming the remainers.\u201d From BBC\u2019s Newsnight: Oliver Dowden has been appointed paymaster general and minister for the Cabinet Office and will also attend cabinet, Downing Street has said. Jacob Rees-Mogg, named lord president of the council and leader of the House of Commons, told Sky News: \u201cThe prime minister kindly offered me a very interesting job to do, one that is something that I\u2019m very interested in because parliamentary procedure and practice is something I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on.\u201d He described Johnson as \u201cincredibly businesslike and ready to crack on and deliver for the country\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a man with a mission, and that mission is to get us out of the EU by 31 October.\u201d Jo Johnson has been appointed minister of state at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Department for Education and will also attend cabinet, Downing Street said. Brandon Lewis has been appointed minister of state for the Home Office and will also attend cabinet, Downing Street said. From the BBC\u2019s Newsnight: From the Guardian\u2019s Jamie Grierson: Esther McVey has been appointed minister of state at the ministry of housing, communities and local government and will also attend cabinet, Downing Street has announced. Jacob Rees-Mogg has been appointed lord president of the council, and leader of the House of Commons and will also attend cabinet, Downing Street said. From the BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw: From Nick Boles, independent member of parliament for Grantham and Stamford. James Cleverly has been appointed minister without portfolio and Conservative party chairman, Downing Street has announced. Alok Sharma, appointed international development secretary, said: \u201cWe will work across the whole of government to deliver Brexit and make sure UK aid is tackling global challenges that affect us all, such as climate change, disease and humanitarian disasters. \u201cInvesting 0.7% of GNI on international development shows we are an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain that is fully engaged with the world. \u201cI am committed to transforming the lives of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people, giving them access to quality education and jobs, while promoting Britain\u2019s economic, security and foreign interests.\u201d From the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey: The appointment of Julian Smith, the former chief whip, to the Northern Ireland job will be welcomed in Dublin after the fairly disastrous Karen Bradley, who survived in the role despite some major gaffes. He could turn into a key interlocutor for the Irish government, taking the place of David Lidington, who had good relations with Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, and the Irish embassy in London. After his most recent job of coaxing, cajoling and threatening Tory MPs into the lobbies, he will have sharpened his ability to spot trouble on the horizon. In this must-read profile by my colleague Dan Sabbagh he might get more aggro from his daughter. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/30/julian-smith-chief-whip-may-brexit \u201cTo win people round, Smith often tells stories about his five-year-old daughter, who he says is \u2018fed up\u2019 with hearing about Brexit details such as the Northern Ireland backstop.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s front page tomorrow. Rishi Sunak has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury, Downing Street said. From the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot: Labour has given its reaction to the new Cabinet, warning of of an influx of \u201chardline conservatives\u201d. Deputy leader Tom Watson said the \u201chuge cull\u201d would lead to the \u201cearly collapse\u201d of the government, bringing forward a general election. The SNP said the \u201ccabinet from hell\u201d was shaping up to be the \u201cworst since Thatcher\u201d. From the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor Rowena Mason: Here is a statement from the new Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. With that, I\u2019m finishing for tonight. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is taking over now. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: Mogg, of course, is Jacob Rees-Mogg. Geoffrey Cox remains as attorney general, No 10 has announced. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: From the Times\u2019s Steven Swinford: From the new international development secretary, Alok Sharma: Natalie Evans remains as leader of the Lords, No 10 has announced. Her full title is Lady Evans of Bowes Park. From the Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones: Alister Jack is the new Scottish secretary. He was only elected to parliament two years ago, as MP for Dumfries and Galloway, and he only joined the government as a whip earlier this year. It is very unusual for an MP to make cabinet this quickly. But the Tories only have 13 MPs in Scotland, and so Johnson\u2019s options were limited. Julian Smith has been moved from chief whip to Northern Ireland secretary. Technically that counts as a promotion, because as chief whip Smith attended cabinet without being a full member, but it probably won\u2019t feel like that. As chief whip, he was very much at the centre of government decision-making. In his new job, he will be more peripheral. From Stephen Barclay, who remains as Brexit secretary: From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson: Alun Cairns stays as Welsh secretary, No 10 has announced. Grant Shapps has returned to cabinet as transport secretary. Shapps sat in cabinet when he was Conservative chairman under David Cameron. He voted remain in 2016, but he led a failed plot to get rid of Theresa May in 2017 and has been a key figure in the Boris Johnson campaign. As Johnson was deciding how to win over MPs, he relied heavily on a remarkably detailed spreadsheet prepared by Shapps which catalogued MPs\u2019 views on all manner of topics. This is from my colleague Peter Walker on the new housing secretary. Alok Sharma, the employment minister, has been promoted to cabinet, joining as international development secretary. He backed remain in 2016, but he was a junior minister under Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office and has been a high-profile supporter of his leadership campaign. Robert Buckland, the former solicitor general who is currently prisons minister, has been promoted to lord chancellor and justice secretary. He voted remain in 2016. Here are more pictures from the protest against Boris Johnson outside Number 10. Amber Rudd remains as work and pensions secretary, Number 10 has announced. Her decision to resign herself to a no-deal Brexit being an acceptable outcome seems to have paid off. Protesters have been marching down Whitehall, past Downing Street, shouting \u201cFuck off back to Eton\u201d at the new prime minister, who is in his Number 10 office a few hundred yards away. This is from the BBC\u2019s Joey D\u2019Urso. Robert Jenrick, a Treasury minister, has been promoted to the cabinet, where he will be secretary of state for housing, communities and local government. Jenrick voted remain in 2016, but he has been an enthusiastic support of Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and one of the MPs doing most to try to enable MPs to block a no-deal Brexit, has told Sky News that he does not share the optimism that Boris Johnson was proclaiming in his speech in Downing Street earlier. Asked how he would describe Johnson, Grieve replied: He\u2019s a charlatan. That is the clear evidence of his career and the way he has operated politically. That is one of the things that has caused me so much disquiet over his leadership bid, but a majority of the party have been taken in by his offer \u2026 We are going to have to see if in office he behaves differently from [the way] he has behaved at other times in his career. Those of us who have worked alongside him and had a chance of watching him can see for ourselves his modus operandi and his capacity both for deception and self-deception, and those are the two ingredients of charlatanism. And Andrea Leadsom, who was leader of the Commons until two months ago, is back in cabinet as business secretary, No 10 has announced. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary who currently chairs the Commons Treasury committee, has been appointed culture secretary. Morgan voted remain, and is on the moderate wing of the party, and this is one of the few appointments tonight that counters the overall narrative of this reshuffle \u2013 which is that Boris Johnson has dismissed a relatively balanced cabinet dominated by managerial May loyalists and replaced it with a rightwing, hard Brexit reincarnation of the Vote Leave campaign. Downing Street has just confirmed that Gavin Williamson, a former defence secretary and chief whip, is the new education secretary. Here is Ian Lavery, the chair of the Labour party, on the reshuffle. Boris Johnson\u2019s first act as PM has been to appoint a cabinet of hardline conservatives who will only represent the privileged few. A chancellor who\u2019s consistently called for more tax cuts for big corporations, home and education secretaries who were sacked for breaches of national security, and a foreign secretary who doesn\u2019t know the importance of our ports. This out-of-touch cabinet pushed for nine years of damaging austerity, while demanding tax cuts for the super-rich and big corporations. We need a general election and a Labour government that will bring real change for the many, not the privileged few, which Johnson and his cabinet represent. No 10 has not announced the new education secretary yet, but Lavery has probably read this tweet. Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary and another alumnus of the Vote Leave campaign, has returned to the cabinet as environment secretary. The SNP has described the new cabinet as \u201cthe worst since Thatcher\u201d. This is from the SNP MP Pete Wishart: Boris Johnson\u2019s nightmare Tory government is shaping up to be the worst since Thatcher \u2013 packed full of extreme Brexiteers and rabid rightwingers who want to drag us back to a bygone era. Senior Tory cabinet ministers have threatened to cut Scotland\u2019s budget, roll back devolution, and impose a devastating Brexit \u2013 that would inflict serious harm on Scottish jobs, living standards, public services and the economy. This is a Tory cabinet from hell, which Donald Trump or Nigel Farage would be proud of \u2013 with members who want to scrap the Barnett formula, privatise the NHS, roll back workers\u2019 rights, undo the welfare state, cut taxes for the rich, and even bring back the death penalty. Westminster is becoming more extreme and out of touch by the day, while Scotland is being ignored and our interests are being sidelined. It\u2019s no wonder that support for independence is growing and a majority want a fresh referendum. This is from the Labour Campaign for Human Rights. Matt Hancock was one of the most enthusiastic late recruits to the Boris Johnson campaign, at some cost to his dignity. But it did not earn him a promotion. He is staying as health secretary, No 10 has confirmed. Here is a Guardian panel on the Boris Johnson speech earlier, with contributions from Zoe Williams, Owen Jones, Simon Jenkins, Anand Menon and Katy Balls. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was publicly pitching for the chancellor\u2019s job. There was speculation that she could go to business. Instead she will replace Liam Fox as international trade secretary, No 10 has announced. Ben Wallace, the Home Office minister and a longstanding Boris Johnson ally, has been made defence secretary, Number 10 says. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has been made chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. That means he will be based in the Cabinet Office. On paper, that does not seem like much of a job. The formal demands of the job are minimal (like appointing vicars in Lancashire). But the title is normally bestowed on a minister given some kind of \u201cfixer\u201d role. David Lidington, Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, was chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Oliver Letwin also held the post. Over the weekend the Boris Johnson camp briefed that Gove would be getting a promotion. This job could be a promotion, but that will depend on what Johnson asks Gove to \u201cfix\u201d, and how much authority he is given. The person doing this job also often doubles us as \u201cminister for the Today programme\u201d - ie the government\u2019s go-to media performer. This is something Gove would do very well. Stephen Barclay is staying as Brexit secretary, No 10 has announced. Priti Patel told Sky News it was a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to be appointed home secretary, adding that the role comes with \u201csignificant responsibilities\u201d. She said: I will do everything in my power to keep our country safe, our people secure, and also to fight the scourge of crime that we see on our streets. I look forward to the challenges that now lie ahead. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech in Downing Street earlier. Theresa May\u2019s \u201cburning injustices\u201d speech when she was appointed PM turned out to be a very poor guide to what she achieved in office, but it was probably a good pointer to what she would have liked to have done in other circumstances. Johnson\u2019s speech is also worth reading closely - although reading it is not easy, because he does not seem to believe in punctuation. I\u2019ve inserted full stops, commas etc to make it readable. Here are the main points. Johnson declared rhetorical war on the \u201cpessimists\u201d who, he claimed, had been talking the country down. At the start of his speech he said: And so I am standing before you today to tell you, the British people, that those critics are wrong - the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters \u2013 they are going to get it wrong again. The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we are going to restore trust in our democracy. At the end of his speech he also returned to this theme, saying: No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country. They will not succeed today. As I said earlier, Johnson\u2019s key soundbite seems to have been lifted from a Bill Clinton speech in 2012. (See 4.11pm.) You can watch the Clinton speech here (at 47.40). But Clinton deployed his optimism surge at the end of a long and brilliantly-argued speech. For Johnson, the optimism surge was his opening, and his main point. He said the government would immediately start hiring 20,000 more police officers. This commitment came in a passage that implied there would be a frenzy of domestic policy-making in the next few days My job is to make your streets safer \u2013 and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith. My job is to make sure you don\u2019t have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line. My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care and so I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education wherever they are in the country and that\u2019s why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door. All of this sounds like \u201caction this day\u201d stuff, as Churchill would have put it. But these commitments are less imminent than they sound. When Johnson announced his plan for 20,000 more police officers during the leadership campaign, the press notice explicitly said this target would not be hit until 2022, the end of this parliament. Having 20 new hospital upgrades sounds good, but hospitals are being upgraded around the UK all the time. This sounded like a reference to something happening anyway. And on social care Johnson is doing no more than reiterating the government\u2019s determination to address a problem that has been urgent for many years now. Theresa May was also committed to addressing this. Johnson has not said anything about why he might succeed where she didn\u2019t. Johnson said that he wanted to unite the whole of the country. And I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be prime minister of the whole United Kingdom. And that means uniting our country, answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together, so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband we level up across Britain. With higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity we close the opportunity gap, giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK. Because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - the awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red white and blue flag. There is nothing unusual about a new PM wanting to govern for the whole country; all new PMs say they want to do this. But in this passage Johnson seems to be conflating two quite different issues: the need to preserve the union, and the need to address the concerns of so-called left-behind regions. These are two quite different problems, and if Johnson thinks the same solutions will address them, he is mistaken. (Maybe he doesn\u2019t, but the passage reads as if it has been written by someone who thinks the politics of Boston are the same as the politics of Belfast.) He confirmed that he wanted to deliver Brexit by the end of October. \u201cWe will come out of the EU on October 31,\u201d he said. He said that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could get a Brexit deal - and implied that the EU would be to blame if he failed. He said: I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks, and yet without that anti-democratic backstop. And it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate and we are forced to come out with no deal - not because we want that outcome \u2013 of course not - but because it is only common sense to prepare. He implied that he wanted people to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit \u201cwith high hearts and growing confidence\u201d. This is how the speech continued, after the passage quoted above where Johnson said it was \u201ccommon sense\u201d to prepare for no-deal. Let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready, at some point in the near future, to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control, fully determined at last to take advantage of Brexit. Because that is the course on which this country is now set, with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready. And the ports will be ready, and the banks will be ready, and the factories will be ready and business will be ready, and the hospitals will be ready, and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world. In this passage Johnson is conflating preparations for a no-deal Brexit with preparations for Brexit, as if they are the same thing. They are not. But there is almost no one in business preparing for no-deal with \u201chigh hearts\u201d. Johnson claimed that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would have an extra \u00a339bn - the sum due to be paid to the EU under the withdrawal agreement. But the EU does not accept that. And until Johnson became prime minister today, the Treasury\u2019s argument used to be that much of this money would have to be paid anyway, because it represents debts for which the UK is legally liable. Ministers used to argue that, if the UK did not pay up, it could get taken to court, and its reputation as a good faith negotiating partner would be badly damaged. Johnson said that there would be a giveaway budget in the autumn, whatever happened over Brexit. He said: Whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package to boost British business and to lengthen this country\u2019s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment. He called for tax cuts to promote investment in capital and research. He reaffirmed his commitment to free ports. He said he wanted to relax the rules that apply to GM foods after Brexit. Let\u2019s start now to liberate the UK\u2019s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti genetic modification rules and let\u2019s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world. This sounds partly like a US ask for a trade deal. He suggested he wanted the UK to build an alternative to the EU\u2019s Galileo satellite navigation system. He said: Let\u2019s get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems \u2013 UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country. He implied that an early election was likely. At one point Johnson seemed to by toying with his audience, as if he was about to announce an election. (See 3.54pm.) He didn\u2019t, but everything he said about his domestic agenda suggested he will soon want to get a decent majority, because without one his ambitions cannot be achieved. The last person to combine being foreign secretary with first secretary of state was William Hague, who used to deputise for David Cameron at PMQs. Presumably Dominic Raab will do the same for Boris Johnson. MPs being MPs, Tories have probably started already speculating about who their next leader will be. This reshuffle suggests Raab is being lined up as heir apparent. This is from the new chancellor. This is from Liz Truss, who had hoped for one of these top jobs herself. Dominic Raab has been appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state. First secretary of state is a title sometimes given to a minister by the PM. Damian Green was the last person to hold the post. It means Dominic Raab, who was Brexit secretary until he resigned at the end of last year because he was opposed to the withdrawal agreement, is effectively deputy prime minister (unless Boris Johnson surprises us all and appoints an actual deputy prime minister). Priti Patel is the new home secretary. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has invited Boris Johnson to a \u201cone to one\u201d meeting, the first premier in Europe to do so. Interviewed on RT\u00c9 Six One TV news, Varadkar said he wanted an \u201corderly\u201d exit but warned that Ireland\u2019s red lines over the Irish border \u201chave not changed\u201d. He said: These are the kind of things we have to discuss. I look forward to having the opportunity to sit down one to one and for our teams to meet and to see if they can put a little detail behind those slogans and statements. He\u2019s a new prime minister and he\u2019s only a few hours in office. Our job is to look out for the best interests of Ireland, the best for the EU, of which we are part, and to try and work with whoever is the British prime minister of the day. Sajid Javid is the new chancellor, No 10 has confirmed. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson made her feelings about Boris Johnson\u2019s sacking of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, immediately and abundantly clear. Describing his work at the Scotland Office as \u201cexemplary\u201d, the warmly-worded statement appears to contrast Mundell\u2019s personal style with that of Johnson, saying: While David chooses to conduct himself publicly in a typically understated manner, his strategic brain has been at the heart of the rebuilding project of the Scottish Conservatives. On a personal level, David handled his coming out as the Conservatives\u2019 first openly gay cabinet minister with customary care and grace. Davidson is not a woman to pick a fight with, and Johnson just has. Jeremy Wright, the culture minister, has also been sacked, according to the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. And here is his tally of the reshuffle so far. Mel Stride\u2019s short cabinet career is over. He was leader of the Commons, but only for two months. He replaced Andrea Leadsom when she quit after Theresa May floated the idea of including a second referendum in the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Stride voted remain in 2016, of course ... Jeremy Corbyn has issued this statement about Boris Johnson\u2019s speech earlier. Corbyn said: After nine years of cuts to our schools, police and councils, the country deserves better than Boris Johnson\u2019s empty bluster. The new prime minister\u2019s priority is more tax giveaways for the richest and big businesses, not support for our public services. The prime minister has no plan for Brexit and is staking everything on a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump which would risk the takeover of our NHS by US corporations. A Labour government can stop Boris Johnson and bring an end to austerity, tackle the climate emergency and invest in our communities. We need a general election and a Labour government that works for the many, not the privileged few. Jeremy Hunt has been sacked as foreign secretary. He says he was offered another job (reportedly defence) but decided to return to the backbenches. Priti Patel, the former international development secretary, has just gone into No 10. If she is going in this early, that suggests that she is becoming home secretary. Patel would be the most rightwing home secretary for decades. Only eight years ago she was advocating the death penalty. David Mundell has been sacked as Scottish secretary. He wanted to stay, but he has not been willing to agree that a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. It looks as though we have finished the sacking phase of the reshuffle. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has just gone through the door at No 10. He is expected to emerge as chancellor. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Here is some comment on the reshuffle from journalists. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford And James Brokenshire, another remainer, is out. He was housing secretary. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, is also out, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Bradley was another cabinet remainer. Damian Hinds has quit as education secretary. A remain voter, he has not really spoken about about his concerns about a no-deal Brexit, but he was always identified with the Brexit moderates such as David Gauke and Greg Clark. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has left the cabinet at his own request, Sky\u2019s Sam Coates reports. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Greg Clark, the business secretary, has also been sacked. Clark voted remain in 2016 and is strongly opposed to a no-deal Brexit, and as a result was never expected to be offered a post in a Boris Johnson cabinet. But unlike his fellow cabinet no-deal opponents Philip Hammond, David Gauke and David Lidington, Clark chose not to resign pre-emptively. He wanted to force Johnson to sack him. Clark was also a Jeremy Hunt supporter. It is starting to look like a cull of Jeremy Hunt supporters. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and another Brexiter, has been sacked. He had made it clear that he wanted to stay in his post. But he probably did not help his chances in recent weeks by publicly contradicting some of the claims Boris Johnson was making about a no-deal Brexit. This is from Deborah Haynes, Sky\u2019s foreign affairs editor, and previously defence editor at the Times. Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, has left the government. This is a surprise. Although Mordaunt backed Jeremy Hunt for the leadership, she voted leave in 2016 and is well-regarded as a cabinet minister. With Boris Johnson keen to increase the number of women in his cabinet, many people assumed her job was secure. But this morning it was reported that Johnson had offered Mordaunt\u2019s job to Jeremy Hunt, implying that Johnson was proposing to move her, or get rid of her completely. We don\u2019t know yet whether she was sacked outright or (which seems more likely) whether she was offered an alternative post that she did not want to accept. Mordaunt only became defence secretary earlier this year and, as someone with a defence background, had described it as her ideal job. It has been confirmed that David Frost, the former British ambassador to Denmark and former head of the Europe division at the Foreign Office, is joining Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit team. Jeff Adams, chairman of the board of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, where Frost currently works, issued this statement. With the agreement of our board, LCCI has agreed to release David Frost from his contract as CEO to take up a position with the new government. The reasons that Prime Minister Johnson has invited David to serve in government are why LCCI was so keen to bring David in as our chief executive earlier this year. David\u2019s diplomatic, international trade, and business experience is extensive. LCCI has no doubt he will be a key asset to the UK in the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. We wish him all the best in the new role, and he knows from his time with us that London, like all the chambers in our national network, are keen to see a Brexit scenario that ensures businesses will be able to continue to flourish and grow. Here is the start of a Downing Street email that has just been sent to lobby journalists. It\u2019s the first official communique I\u2019ve received with the phrase \u201cPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u201d in it. It really has happened ... I will post a summary/analysis of the speech shortly. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has released the text of his letter to Boris Johnson. It is remarkably short, and curt. It conveys a strong undertone of: \u201cSee me in my study at 10am Monday.\u201d There is no doubt about who\u2019s thinks they\u2019re boss. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn The best soundbite in Boris Johnson\u2019s speech was the one about how people who bet against Britain lose their shirts. He liked it so much he used it twice. It sounded familiar. Bill Clinton said almost the same thing in his speech to the 2012 Democratic convention (one of the best political speeches of modern times). In his peroration Clinton said: Look, I love our country so much. And I know we\u2019re coming back. For more than 200 years, through every crisis, we\u2019ve always come back. (Cheers.) People have predicted our demise ever since George Washington was criticised for being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of wooden false teeth. (Laughter.) And so far, every single person that\u2019s bet against America has lost money because we always come back. (Cheers, applause.) We come through ever fire a little stronger and a little better. The UK should be outward-looking, he says. He says no one has succeeded in betting against Britain. The work begins now, he says. And that\u2019s it. Johnson says we should look at the opportunities. Let\u2019s get going on things like free ports, he says. He call for more UK satellites. He calls for tax breaks for innovation. And let\u2019s do something for animal welfare. (That sounds like a sop to his partner, Carrie Symonds, an environmental campaigner.) He says his message to the Irish is that he is confident we can get a deal, without the undemocratic backstop. But he must prepare for the \u201cremote possibility\u201d of there being no deal, he says. (That is not the same as a million-to-one possibility, which was how he put it a few weeks ago.) Johnson says no-deal Brexit is a \u201cremote possibility\u201d. He says, if there is no-deal, the UK will have its \u00a339bn. Yes, there will be difficulties if there is no-deal, he says. But his message to business is that it is not the decisions that are causing problems, but the refusal to take decisions. Johnson says the union flag stands for values, including equality and democracy. That is why the government will deliver Brexit \u2013 people voted for it, and the decision must be respected. He says he wants a new partnership with the EU. His first step is to thank the EU nationals working in the UK. Under his government, they will have the absolute right to remain. Johnson says he wants to unite the country. He says he wants to level up. It is time to unleash the productive power of the whole of the UK - the \u201cawesome foursome\u201d that is the whole of the UK. The UK is more than the sum of its parts, he says. It is loved through the world. Johnson says he will take personal responsibility. Never mind the backstop - the buck stops here. He says he can announce - that he will fix the crisis in social care. (Not an election, then?) He says he is confident that we can do this. We will crack this in 99 days, he says. But we won\u2019t wait till then. (Is he going for an early election?) Boris Johnson is now being applauded as he walks to the podium outside Number 10. He says the Queen has invited him to form a government and he has accepted. He pays tribute to Theresa May. But despite all her work there are pessimists who think the UK has become a prisoner to the arguments of 2016. Those critics - \u201cthe doubters, the gloomsters\u201d - are wrong. The people who bet against Britain will lose their shirts, he says. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has a better picture. Boris Johnson has left Buckingham Palace and is being driven to Number 10. Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson\u2019s partner, is in Downing Street for his arrival, according to the BBC\u2019s Rachel Kennedy. Symonds has not been seen in public with Johnson for some time. Johnson does not discuss his private life, and their relationship has been reported in different ways in different papers. Some have said she will move into Downing Street with him; another report suggested the relationship was cooling. The Brexit party has just posted this on Twitter. It is quite similar to the attack tweets being issued by Labour yesterday, like this one. Here is my colleague John Crace\u2019s take on that photograph. Boris Johnson is now prime minister. We have not had the formal announcement from Buckingham Palace yet, but they have released the photograph of his audience with her, which effectively confirms the appointment. This is from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford on the likely composition of Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet. Boris Johnson is reportedly going to make Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, foreign secretary. (See 12.43pm.) Asked on BBC News if he would welcome this, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said he would. He explained: I heard Jeremy Hunt talking just two days ago about shipping in the Gulf, and the need to build a European protection force, a European navy. I would much rather see someone like Dominic Raab [as foreign secretary], who believes in Brexit and doesn\u2019t want us being part of a European army. For anyone who would like to see Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips as PM, here\u2019s her manifesto. This is from Natalie Bennett, the former Green party leader, on the Greenpeace protest in the Mall. This is from Greenpeace UK explaining what the protest on the Mall was all about. Boris Johnson is now in Buckingham Palace meeting the Queen. Here is the protest. There is a protest in the Mall. Some Greenpeace protesters are blocking the Mall to try to stop Boris Johnson reaching Buckingham Palace. From ITV\u2019s Chris Ship Theresa May has resigned, and Boris Johnson has yet to be appointed PM. For a brief few minutes no one is running the country ... Theresa May has now left Downing Street. She is leaving London and going back to her home in her constituency. David Gauke has resigned as justice secretary, as he said he would. He is refusing to serve in Boris Johnson\u2019s government because he is opposed to a no-deal Brexit. In his resignation letter Gauke says: In my view, the only responsible way to honour the 2016 referendum result is to leave the EU with a deal and, without such a deal, I fear for the prosperity, security and unity of the United Kingdom. Given Boris [Johnson\u2019s] stated policy of leaving the EU by 31 October at all costs, I am not willing to serve in his government. I believe I can most effectively make the case against a no-deal Brexit from the backbenches. From the veteran political journalist Michael Crick Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s final speech. There was not really any news in it, although her call for a Brexit that \u201cworks for the whole of the United Kingdom\u201d was a way of telling Boris Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit. As Nick Robinson argued in last week\u2019s BBC documentary Britain\u2019s Brexit Crisis (which is well worth watching, if you have not seen it yet), it was a visit to Northern Ireland, and conversations with people who said no-deal could lead to Northern Ireland leaving the UK, that persuaded May to abandon her belief that no-deal was acceptable as a fallback option. May said: I am about to go to Buckingham Palace to tender my resignation to Her Majesty the Queen and to advise her to ask Boris Johnson to form a new administration. I repeat my warm congratulations to Boris on winning the Conservative leadership election. I wish him and the government he will lead every good fortune in the months and years ahead. Their successes will be our country\u2019s successes, and I hope that they will be many. Their achievements will build on the work of nearly a decade of Conservative or Conservative-led government. During that time our economy has been restored, our public services reformed, and our values defended on the world stage. Of course, much remains to be done \u2013 the immediate priority being to complete our exit from the European Union in a way that works for the whole United Kingdom. With success in that task can come a new beginning for our country \u2013 a national renewal that can move us beyond the current impasse into the bright future the British people deserve. To serve as prime minister of the United Kingdom is the greatest honour. The heavy responsibilities are outweighed by the huge potential to serve your country. But you achieve nothing alone. And as I leave Downing Street, my final words are of sincere thanks. To my colleagues in government and parliament. To everyone in the building behind me and across the civil service. To the men and women of our armed forces and security services. And to the public servants in our schools, our NHS, our police and the other emergency services. All are inspired by the noble wish to serve their country in the national interest. I also want to thank the British people. Everyone who loves our great country, who works hard for their family and wants their children and grand-children to enjoy greater opportunity than they did. Thank you for putting your faith in me and giving me the chance to serve. This is a country of aspiration and opportunity and I hope that every young girl who has seen a woman prime minister now knows for sure that there are no limits to what they can achieve. Finally and most of all, I want to thank my husband Philip \u2013 who has been my greatest supporter and my closest companion. I am about to leave Downing Street but I am proud to continue as the member of parliament for Maidenhead. I will continue to do all I can to serve the national interest. And play my part in making our United Kingdom \u2013 a great country with a great future \u2013 a country that truly works for everyone. Theresa May has now arrived at Buckingham Palace to see the Queen. May says she wishes Boris Johnson and his team every good fortune. Their successes will be our successes, she says. She says much remains to be done. Brexit must be finished in a way that works for the whole of the UK. Then Britain can move to a bright future. Being PM is a heavy honour, she says. She says you achieve nothing alone. She says her final words of of sincere thanks - to her staff, to people in parliament, to people in the armed forces, and to public servants, in schools, the NHS and the civil service. She also wants to thank the British people - everyone who works hard and wants their children to do better. Thank you for putting your faith in me and giving me the chance to serve. She says she hopes young girls have seen her and thought there is nothing they cannot achieve. She ends by thanking her husband, Philip. In the background Steve Bray, the \u201cMr Stop Brexit\u201d campaigner who has become a Westminster fixture, can he heard shouting: \u201cStop Brexit.\u201d \u201cI think not,\u201d says May. And that\u2019s it. Theresa May is about to deliver her final speech as prime minister, as she leaves Downing Street on her way to Buckingham Palace to submit her resignation to the Queen. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, is also resigning, he has announced on Twitter. Lidington was not expected to stay in cabinet under Boris Johnson, not least because he is firmly opposed to a no-deal Brexit, an option that Johnson is refusing to rule out. This is from Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, on PMQs. The chief whip in the Lords, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, is also standing down. A source said this had been long planned and was not to do with the \u201cpolitical situation\u201d. As the Press Association reports, the source went on: \u201cHe has been on the frontbench for a long time.\u201d Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the EU will be ready if Boris Johnson pursues a no-deal strategy. Today he met MEPs on the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. (See 11.56am.) Barnier said he was waiting to hear from the Tory leader about his plans for Brexit and stressed that a no-deal outcome would never be the EU\u2019s preference. Speaking to the BBC, Barnier said: It\u2019s a very important moment for Brexit. We look forward to hearing what the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants, what are the choices of the UK. Is it an orderly Brexit? This is the choice, the preference of the EU and we have worked for an orderly Brexit all along the last three years. Is it a no-deal Brexit? A no-deal Brexit will never be, never, the choice of the EU. But we are prepared. And for an orderly Brexit we will work along the next few weeks and months with the new UK government in the best possible way in a very constructive spirit to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that crashing out of the EU with no deal would be less painful because of a series of \u201cside deals\u201d that the UK has already done with Brussels have been dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d by the EU, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. This is from David Cameron, the former Conservative PM: The use of \u201cbut\u201d in Cameron\u2019s second sentence may be telling. It makes the sentence read like a warning to Boris Johnson that he should not ignore the advice he gets from his civil servants. It might have been inspired by the news that Johnson intends to take Dominic Cummings into No 10 as an adviser. During the coalition, Cummings was fiercely critical of Cameron, and also of some of Cameron\u2019s most senior civil service advisers. Here is an extract from Philip Hammond\u2019s resignation letter: Most importantly, we bequeath to our successors genuine choices, once a Brexit deal is done: the ability to choose, within the fiscal rules, between increasing public spending, reduced taxes, higher investment or progress towards faster debt reduction \u2013 or some combination of all four. After a decade when the aftermath of the 2008-09 recession meant we had no choices, this is a luxury which our successors should use wisely. Philip Hammond has resigned as chancellor, as he said he would at the weekend. That was the longest PMQs in history, according to the BBC\u2019s Daniel Kraemer. And this is what Theresa May said in her final reply to Jeremy Corbyn, suggesting it was time for him to quit: One thing we both have in common is a commitment to our constituencies, I saw that after the terrorist attack in Finsbury Park mosque in his constituency. Perhaps I could just finish my exchange with him by saying this: as a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same? This is what Theresa May said about the Commons in her final remarks in PMQs. We are living through extraordinary political times. This House of Commons is rightly at the centre of those events. That\u2019s because of the vital link between every single member of this House and the communities, the Commons that we represent. That\u2019s the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy and of our liberty. And each of us, wherever we sit and whatever we stand for, can take pride in that. That duty to my constituents will remain my greatest motivation. PMQs - snap verdict: A PM\u2019s final PMQs is essentially a leaving do and, like most leaving dos, they are often thick with hypocrisy \u2013 effusive tributes from people who have been wanting you gone for years. There was a whiff of that today, but what was striking about most of the tributes paid to Theresa May, from MPs from all sides, was their focus on her sense of public duty. The legislative achievements of her three-year premiership are almost non-existent, she failed to deliver Brexit, but even her critics accept (mostly) that May is motivated by a sense of public service and that she is dogged in the face of adversity, and this is what people raised repeatedly this afternoon. In normal circumstances this would not really merit noting (you would expect the prime minister to be a person of integrity), but with Boris Johnson about to become prime minster, these virtues might soon seem more of a rarity. Various MPs tried to get May to criticise her successor, but largely she refused to engage with this line of attack, except perhaps in her peroration, which if you were being mischievous you could read as a coded attack on the notion of proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. (See 1.05pm.) Instead May concentrated her fire on Jeremy Corbyn. In the course of his six questions Corbyn provided a fairly comprehensive list of May\u2019s policy failures, broken promises, and ideas lifted from Labour. But May\u2019s final jibe about how it was time for Corbyn to consider standing down too was an effective riposte, principally because it chimed with what many Labour MPs think. Harriet Harman, the mother of the Commons (longest-serving female MP), says May was only the second female PM. Even her harshest critics must recognise her public service, her integrity and her commitment to her country. But she has some advice: sometimes you have to be careful when a man wants to hold your hand. (That\u2019s a reference to Trump.) May thanks Harman for what she has done to get more women into the Commons. She says when she became an MP in 1997, there were only 13 female Tory MP. She remembers someone assuming she must be Labour because she was a woman. May says we are living through extraordinary times. The House of Commons is, rightly, at the centre of events. That is because MPs represent their constituents. That duty to serve her constituents will remain her greatest motivation. May leaves. Tory MPs give her a standing ovation. But not Labour MPs, although a few Labour MPs seem to be joining in the applause. Dame Cheryl Gillan, a Conservative, says there are 2.8 million families living with autism in this country. They are often isolated. Will May join the all-party group on autism? May pays tribute to Gillan for passing the Autism Act as a backbencher. She says she has committed to taking the autism training available to MPs. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says although they have disagreed, she respects May\u2019s commitment to service and her resilience. She asks if May will speak out if it looks as though Boris Johnson is ignoring warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. May says she is confident Johnson will consider all the issues. But if Cooper is so concerned about the security risks of no deal, she should have voted for a deal. Helen Whately, a Conservative, asks May if she will continue to push for women to be more empowered. May says she wants women to know there are no limits to what they can do. Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, says it is inspiring for girls to see women in positions of power. She asks if May has advice for men who think they can do a better job but who are not prepared to do the work. May says her advice to women is to be yourself. And she congratulates Swinson on her election. She is glad the Lib Dems now have a woman leader. She says almost all parties in the Commons have had a woman as leader, including even the Independent Group for Change, which is now on its second female leader. Only Labour has not had a woman as leader, she says. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, says he has not always seen eye to eye with May. (He led a move to force her out at the end of last year.) But he thanks May for her service, and her courtesy. May thanks Rees-Mogg. She says the Commons is meant to be about debate and argument and discussion. Those debates are best held when they are conducted with courtesy. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, thanks May for her public service, and for her proper relations with the DUP. Working together, they have ensured there is a proper Conservative and unionist government. And they have ensured there is no early election. He urges May to take a walking holiday in Northern Ireland. May thanks Dodds for his comments. Victoria Prentis, a Conservative, thanks May for her personal commitment to Syria. May says the government remains committed to working for a political solution. Ian Austin, the former Labour MP who now sits as an independent, says he agrees with what May said to Corbyn about it being time for him to stand down. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of Labour MPs agree, he claims. He says his constituents want more police on the beat. Will she urge Boris Johnson to ensure the West Midlands gets all the support it needs. May congratulates Austin on his recent appointment as a government trade envoy to Israel. She says she presumes Austin did not approve of Labour voting against extra money and powers for the police. Back at PMQs, the Conservative John Hayes asks May if she considers reducing the number of workless households as one of her main achievements? May pays tribute to Hayes\u2019 work as a minister, and she agrees with his point about workless households. Turning away from PMQs, this is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Dame Caroline Spelman, a Conservative, praises May\u2019s record on modern slavery and says she hopes May will continue to campaign on this as a backbencher. May says this is a scourge. And it does not just affect migrants, she says. She says there are British citizens in slavery. Labour\u2019s Vernon Coaker says last year 507 victims of modern slavery were locked up as illegal immigrants. That can\u2019t be right, he says. May says the Modern Slavery Act was meant to address this. She says the government will accept most of the recommendations from a review looking at how victims are treated. The Conservative Keith Simpson commends May for her stamina and her courage. He says he assumes May will recommend to the Queen that she appoints Boris Johnson as PM. But does she have one piece of hard advice for Johnson on being PM? May says some of her colleagues are saying her advice should be to read Simpson\u2019s annual summer reading list. (Simpson, a historian, produces every summer a reading list for colleagues.) Tom Brake, a Lib Dem, asks May if she agrees all politicians should call out nationalist rhetoric which paints others as enemies or victimises minorities. May says everyone in public life should be careful about the language they use. Alistair Burt, the Tory former Foreign Office minister, asks if May agrees with him about the importance of combating misinformation about vaccines. And will she urge Boris Johnson to keep the Department for International Development as a standalone department? May says she agrees with Burt about vaccines. And she is proud of the fact that the UK has DfID. It is an important element of global Britain, she says. The SNP\u2019s John McNally asks about a constituent killed in Iraq. His death has not been satisfactorily explained. Will May ensure it is investigated? May says the MoD will provide a response. Helen Grant, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees more needs to be done to help the victims of crime. May says this is an important issue. She is proud of the domestic abuse bill that has been introduced, and looks forward to it being debated. She says she wants to do more to raise awareness. Domestic violence must be seen for the crime it is, she says. Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory former cabinet minster, pays tribute to May. When they both joined the government in 2010, the government was borrowing \u00a31 for every \u00a34 it spent. Now it is \u00a31 for every \u00a334, he says. May says the government has delivered an economy fit for the future. Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan says outgoing US presidents can pardon people. Would May pardon Boris Johnson for sabotaging her government for his own ambition? May says the government has worked to improve people\u2019s lives, and she will support her successor. The Conservative Michael Fabricant asks about Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands, and if May will continue to champion devolution. May says the government and the West Midlands mayor have done a lot for the region. Labour\u2019s Chi Onwurah asks May about her choices \u2013 the House of Lords, dignity in retirement, working with her successor \u2013 and she asks if May will campaign for Waspi women \u2013 Women Against State Pension Inequality \u2013 in the future. May says she intends to continue in the Commons as MP for Maidenhead. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the time to hold May to account is over. Although they have had their differences, they have stood together at other times too, as over the Salisbury poisoning attacks. He thanks her for ensuring that opposition parties were kept informed during those events. He asks if May is confident that standards will be upheld by her \u201cflagrant\u201d successor. May thanks Blackford for his support on issues like Salisbury. And she says she does have confidence that Boris Johnson will deliver for the whole of the UK. Blackford says Johnson has no mandate in Scotland. He says the SNP has tabled an early day motion saying the Commons should not be shut down until November. Will May sign it as a backbencher? May says she and Blackford both have a passion for delivering for Scotland. The government has a mandate, she says. And she says the government also has a duty to deliver on the results of the 2016 referendum. Corbyn says Boris Johnson thought the Isle of Man was in the EU, and that the EU made rules about kippers that were actually made by the UK. Johnson also thought a Gatt rule could be used to allow tariff-free trade after a no-deal Brexit, even though the governor of the Bank of England said that was impossible. How successful has her attempt to stop fake news been. Not very, says May, judging by the amount of fake news Corbyn uses. Corbyn ends by listing some of May\u2019s U-turns, on matters like the dementia tax and fox hunting. Given that Johnson has no mandate, shouldn\u2019t he call a general election? May says, if Corbyn wants to talk about ducking election commitments, what about Corbyn promising to get rid of student debt? And Corbyn claimed during the election he was committed to Trident. He has broken promise after promise. She says, since this is their last exchange, PMQs is one of the strengths of the British political system. But he and she are very different politicians. She has spent all but one year of her time in politics trying to implement politics. Corbyn has spent most of his time on the backbenches. She says they have one thing in common \u2013 they are both committed to their constituencies, as she saw by Corbyn\u2019s response to the terror attack in his constituency. But, she goes on, as someone who knows when it is time to give up, she suggests that Corbyn ought to realise it is time for him to go too. One thing we both have in common is a commitment to our constituencies, I saw that after the terrorist in Finsbury Park Mosque in his constituency. Perhaps I could just finish my exchange with him by saying this: As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up, perhaps the time is now for him to do the same? May uses her final exchange with Corbyn to tell him to quit as Labour leader. Corbyn says he does not know where May gets her figures on rough sleeping from. He says he has travelled around the country and witnessed the problem. It should not be happening in a country like his. He asks May which of various policies he approves of she is most proud of. May says she is proud of many things, including giving more funding to the NHS. Corbyn says the three policies, like cutting the maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals, he mentioned were not in the Tory manifesto in 2017. But they were all in Labour\u2019s. He asks if May thinks Boris Johnson can get a Brexit deal through parliament. May says she voted for a deal. Corbyn voted against it. At every stage his only interest has been in playing party politics. Frankly, he should be ashamed of himself. Jeremy Corbyn says this is May\u2019s last day in office. He pays tribute to her sense of public service. He says this can put great pressure on people\u2019s families. He asks if May will continue her public service from the backbenches, opposing the reckless plans of her successor. After a pause, he goes on. He says child poverty, pensioner poverty, in-work poverty, violent crime, homelessness and food bank use have all gone up. Does May have any regrets about that? May says (picking up on a line Corbyn used) that it is good to see the Tories in good heart. You cannot say the same of Labour, she says. She says people have jobs for the first time, there are children going to university, and people owning their own homes. She says politics is about the difference you can make to people\u2019s lives. Corbyn agrees. He says per pupil school funding is down, and GP numbers are falling. The Tory manifesto said TV licences for the over-75s would be protected, and homelessness would be halved. Which of these promises does she regret not keeping? May says rough sleeping is going down. She says the manifesto set 2022 as a target. Bob Blackman, a Conservative, asks if May agrees that prevention is better than cure in relation to issues like homelessness and smoking. May says prevention is key to giving people healthier lives. Labour\u2019s Ruth Cadbury asks how May feels about handing over to someone who is happy to demonise Muslims, who does not support civil servants, and who is subordinate to Donald Trump. May says she is happy to hand over to someone who served in her cabinet. There are loud cheers for Theresa May as she stands up. She says she will have a meeting with the Queen this afternoon. After that she will continue with her duties - as a backbencher, as MP for Maidenhead, she says. Theresa May is about to take her final PMQs. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Kate Green, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons standards committee, has said that appointing Dominic Cummings to a job in Number 10 would be \u201ca very serious matter\u201d given that he has been found guilty of a contempt of parliament. She said: An admonishment of an individual for contempt of parliament is an extremely serious matter, which I would expect any government to take very careful note of in making appointments. Theresa May will take her last PMQs in about half an hour. Tony Blair and David Cameron also resigned on a Wednesday after PMQs, and they both used their final appearances at the despatch box to pay tribute to the value of MPs. You can read Blair\u2019s last PMQs here. He started with a joke his engagements (the first topic that has to be addressed at PMQs). This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others. In addition to my duties in the house, I will have no such further meetings today, or any other day. And he ended the session with a moving tribute to the Commons, and to politics as a calling. Mr. Speaker, if I may just finish with two brief remarks \u2013 first to the house. I have never pretended to be a great House of Commons man, but I pay the house the greatest compliment I can by saying that, from first to last, I never stopped fearing it. The tingling apprehension that I felt at three minutes to 12 today I felt as much 10 years ago, and every bit as acute. It is in that fear that the respect is contained. The second thing that I would like to say is about politics and to all my colleagues from different political parties. Some may belittle politics but we who are engaged in it know that it is where people stand tall. Although I know that it has many harsh contentions, it is still the arena that sets the heart beating a little faster. If it is, on occasions, the place of low skulduggery, it is more often the place for the pursuit of noble causes. I wish everyone, friend or foe, well. That is that. The end. In his final PMQs, Cameron started with a variant on the Blair joke. This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others. Other than one meeting this afternoon with Her Majesty the Queen, the diary for the rest of my day is remarkably light. And here are Cameron\u2019s final words. I will watch these exchanges from the backbenches. I will miss the roar of the crowd and I will miss the barbs from the opposition, but I will be willing you on. When I say \u201cwilling you on\u201d, I do not just mean willing on the new prime minister at this dispatch box, or indeed just willing on the government front bench and defending the manifesto that I helped to put together. I mean willing all of you on, because people come here with huge passion for the issues they care about and with great love for the constituencies that they represent. I will also be willing on this place. Yes, we can be pretty tough, and we test and challenge our leaders \u2013 perhaps more than some other countries \u2013 but that is something we should be proud of, and we should keep at it. I hope that you will all keep at it, and I shall will you on as you do. The last thing I would say is that you can achieve a lot of things in politics and get a lot of things done; in the end, public service and the national interest is what it is all about. Nothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it. After all, as I once said, I was the future once. Cameron\u2019s words were less memorable than Blair\u2019s. And they were also less accurate. Soon afterwards he resigned as an MP, so he no longer watched PMQs from the backbenches, and, in terms of Brexit at least, the jury is still out on: \u201cNothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it.\u201d Margaret Thatcher took her final PMQs the day before she left Downing Street. You can read it here. PMQs was less of an event in those day, because there were two of them every week, lasting just 15 minutes, not just one lasting almost an hour, and the session was not especially valedictory. But Thatcher did start with this line: Mr. Speaker, this morning I had a number of meetings. After my duties 738 in this house, I shall continue to reply to some of the 30,000 letters that have so far been delivered to Downing street in the past few days. Church leaders have written to Boris Johnson warning that a no-deal Brexit will \u201chit those held back by poverty very hard indeed\u201d. The letter says: At a time when increasing numbers of families have difficulties putting enough food on the table, we believe it is irresponsible to consider a course of action that is expected to make that situation worse. The church leaders ask the government to publish evidence of the impact a no-deal Brexit on disadvantaged communities, and invite the prime minister to visit one of many social action projects run by churches to support millions of people who live in poverty. The letter is signed by leaders from the Methodists, the United Reformed church, the Baptists, the Church of Scotland, the Salvation Army, Quakers, and the Scottish Episcopal church. In his Today programme interview this morning Matt Hancock, who is health secretary now but who hopes to have a better job by the end of the day, said that he expected Boris Johnson to give \u201ca surprising amount of detail, especially on the domestic agenda\u201d when he addresses the nation as PM for the first time this afternoon. Hancock said that Johnson felt that people were not focusing enough on the non-Brexit policies that he wants to implement. He also said that, working with Johnson as part of his campaign in recent weeks, he had been surprised by Johnson\u2019s grasp of policy detail. One of the things that surprised me very positively, since joining Boris\u2019s team about a month ago, is the grip on domestic policy ... and the level of detail that he gets into. Whether it\u2019s how we bring our left-behind towns up to speed so they can share with the success that many parts of Britain are seeing, how we can level up education spending, because at the moment it\u2019s very uneven in different parts of the country, so that everybody can get a better education for their children, in social care \u2013 in these three areas I\u2019ve gone into the detail with Boris and he has grip and interest. It looks as if David Gauke, the outgoing justice secretary, has been using that ageing app that is all the rage at the moment. The Daily Mirror has hired a bus to let us know what it feels about the Boris Johnson premiership. This is from Sarah Wollaston, the former Conservative MP who now sits as an independent. Wollaston is referring to how Dominic Cummings was found to be in contempt of parliament because he refused to give evidence to the culture committee inquiry into fake news. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Boris Johnson is said to operate a \u201ccourt\u201d where a wide circle of advisers compete for his attention, not all of them saying the same thing (unlike, say, Theresa May, who relied very heavily on just two close aides when she became PM). Johnson also does not like disappointing people. That might be why he would be attracted to the idea of not have to choose just one person to be chief of staff. More on Dominic Cummings. This is what my colleague Patrick Wintour wrote in 2013, summarising a 250-page essay Cummings had written on how to reform education. Education in England is no better than mediocre, and billions of pounds have been wasted on pointless university courses and Sure Start schemes for young children, Michael Gove\u2019s special adviser has said in an outspoken private thesis written a few weeks before he is due to step down from his post. Dominic Cummings, the most influential adviser to the education secretary in the past five years, also argues in a revealing 250-page paper that \u201creal talent\u201d is rare among the nation\u2019s teachers \u2013 and, eye-catchingly, says educationists need to better understand the impact of genetics on children. The adviser, known for making fierce demands of civil servants, writes that the endgame for the Department for Education should be to reduce its role to acting as accountants and inspectors, employing hundreds and not thousands of civil servants \u2013 and creating an environment in which private and state education would be indistinguishable. The Cummings manifesto claims that \u201cthe education of the majority even in rich countries is between awful and mediocre\u201d, and that the quality of maths education, in particular, is poor. \u201cIn England, few are well trained in the basics of extended writing or mathematical and scientific modelling and problem-solving,\u201d he writes. According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, Boris Johnson is going to appoint Dominic Cummings as a senior adviser. This would be a remarkable appointment \u2013 depending on how much power Cummings ends up having, perhaps one of the two or three most important of the day. Cummings is an ultra-bright, scruffy iconoclast who worked as a special adviser for Michael Gove before becoming campaign director for Vote Leave. He is credited by some with being the mastermind behind that campaign, which is why the playwright James Graham gave him the central role (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) in his TV drama about Brexit. The key point about Cummings is that is he not really a conservative; he is a Tory Leninist who believes British government, and especially the civil service (of which he has been very critical) needs fundamental reform. Officials in Number 10 will be horrified at the prospect of his heading their way. Some of Johnson\u2019s allies in the European Research Group, which represents hardline Brexiter Tories, will also be concerned. Cummings has been caustic about them in the past. For example, this is what he said in a blog earlier this year. Those of you in the narcissist-delusional subset of the ERG who have spent the last three years scrambling for the 8.10 Today slot while spouting gibberish about trade and the law across SW1 \u2013 i.e exactly the contemptible behaviour that led to your enforced marginalisation during the referendum and your attempt to destroy Vote Leave \u2013 you are also in the pirate category. You were useful idiots for remain during the campaign and with every piece of bullshit from Bill Cash et al you have helped only Remain for three years. Remember how you WELCOMED the backstop as a \u2018triumph\u2019 in December 2017 when it was obvious to everybody who knew what was going on \u2013 NOT the cabinet obviously \u2013 that this effectively ended the \u2018negotiations\u2019? Remember how Bernard Jenkin wrote on ConHome that he didn\u2019t have to \u2018ruin his weekend\u2019 reading the document to know it was another success for the natural party of government \u2014 bringing to mind very clearly how during the referendum so many of you guys were too busy shooting or skiing or chasing girls to do any actual work. You should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic. On the Today programme Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, confirmed that Labour is talking to Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit about whether they would support the opposition in a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson. When asked about these talks, Gardiner said: \u201cOf course those discussions are going on.\u201d Here is the scene in Downing Street this morning. Boris Johnson\u2019s unpopularity in Scotland explains why Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, told the Today programme this morning that Boris Johnson could be the last prime minister of the United Kingdom. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has also been making this argument forcefully. This is from ITV\u2019s Joe Pike. The fact that the Scottish edition of the Sun can\u2019t bring itself to print a positive splash about Boris Johnson becoming prime minister tells you a lot about how he is seen as an electoral liability for his party in Scotland. From the Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones According to the official timetable for today, Boris Johnson will not start his cabinet reshuffle until after he has been appointed prime minister by the Queen this afternoon. But, in practice, the reshuffle is already under way - and there is a standoff between Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, his main rival for the leadership. Hunt, the current foreign secretary, has reportedly refused a demotion to defence secretary and is refusing to budge unless he gets one of the cabinet\u2019s most senior jobs. Johnson will have to decide whether to give in, or to see him leave the cabinet altogether. It would not be fatal if Hunt left the cabinet. In 2016 Theresa May sacked Michael Gove, even though he came third in the leadership contest (as he did this time). But it would severely undermine Johnson\u2019s claim to be uniting the party. And it would probably alarm Tory moderates who, despite what Johnson says about being willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit, want to believe that in reality he would never go for that option. These are from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford and the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. As Mattha reported earlier, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has used an article in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) to offer Boris Johnson the prospect of some sort of electoral pact in an autumn election designed to get a parliamentary majority for a hard Brexit. (See 8.34am.) During the leadership campaign Johnson repeatedly ruled this out. And this morning Matt Hancock, the health secretary and now a leading Johnson supporter, when he gave an interview to the Today programme as a proxy for the Johnson campaign. Hancock said: There is no way that we are going to have any kind of electoral pact with the Brexit party and with Nigel Farage. Theresa May views the potential of a no-deal Brexit as a threat to the integrity of the UK, according to the outgoing prime minister\u2019s chief of staff. Former Tory MP Gavin Barwell told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: She is a passionate unionist and she has spent a significant amount of time in Northern Ireland during her premiership. And every time she visited, that, sort of, sense that the combination of Brexit and what it could mean to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and the lack of devolved government in Northern Ireland that there was a real threat. The secretary of state for Northern Ireland is on a statutory duty to call a border poll if she believes there is evidence to support one. So, that is a real concern to her, yes. ITV\u2019s Shehab Khan has tweeted Boris Johnson\u2019s comments about the former prime minister Gordon Brown\u2019s accession to Number 10, which he said was \u201cas democratically proper as the transition from Claudius to Nero\u201d. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said he is open to an electoral pact with Boris Johnson, so long as the incoming PM upholds his leadership election commitment to leaving the European Union by 31 October. Writing in the Daily Telegraph (paywall), Farage declared that a general election is required to deliver Brexit and get any deal through the Commons, predicting that a Brexit-Tory alliance would \u201csmash\u201d the Labour party. He is going to have to risk his longed-for position as PM to ensure Brexit is enacted properly. There is no prospect of a meaningful Brexit thanks to the views of most sitting MPs. And any attempt to prorogue parliament will lead to the PM being brought down by his own side. The inescapable truth, therefore, is that he must hold an autumn general election. That is his only way out .. [and] for this strategy to work, he will need the support of the Brexit party. If he is able to convince us, then together we would electorally smash the Labour party, he would assume a big working majority, and he would go down as one of the great leaders in British history. However, Johnson has ruled out a deal with the Brexit party and has said he does not want an early election. Although the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, have already announced they intend to resign before Johnson takes over the reins of power due to their opposition to a no-deal Brexit, the incoming prime minister is set to enter office with a number of new and returning faces in his cabinet. The Times is reporting that Brexiter Priti Patel is to become home secretary in a return to the frontbench after she was forced to resign from her previous role in the cabinet over unauthorised contact with Israeli officials. Remain-voting employment minister Alok Sharma is set for promotion to a full cabinet role, while the business secretary, Greg Clark, who also opposes no-deal, could depart the top table. Meanwhile, Brexiters including Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom who resigned from May\u2019s government will be eager to return. And what to do with the defeated candidate for leader Jeremy Hunt? He is said to be resisting attempts to demote him as foreign secretary. Elsewhere, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, have been mooted as potential replacements for Hammond as chancellor. Of his initial backroom appointments, that of Sky chief financial officer and chief operating officer Andrew Griffith as chief business adviser to Number 10 is most striking. The Conservative party has chosen, and today Boris Johnson will become prime minister. Here is how the day will pan out. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister\u2019s questions for the final time in the House of Commons. The incoming PM is said not to be expected in the chamber for PMQs, as he prepares his new government. 2pm: After saying goodbye to her staff and giving a brief valedictory speech outside of Number 10 Downing Street, May will travel to Buckingham Palace to formally resign to the queen before heading to her constituency home in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Shortly after his predecessor has left the palace, Johnson will go to see Elizabeth II, where she will appoint him as prime minister. 4pm: Johnson will be driven to Downing Street, where he will address the nation for the first time in his new job before meeting the staff in his new home. Sky News is reporting that he will then be given an urgent security briefing. 5pm: In one-on-one meetings his parliamentary office in the House of Commons, Johnson is expected to sack the majority of the current Cabinet. 7.30pm: Back in Downing Street, the new prime minister will begin installing his new heads of department, and is reportedly aiming to have at least 12 cabinet positions filled by 10pm. As my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot report, Johnson is already \u201clove-bombing\u201d centre-ground MPs as speculation swirls over the makeup of his first cabinet. Here\u2019s what the papers had to say about the PM in waiting overnight, courtesy of my colleague Kate Lyons. Meanwhile, the EU has dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d Johnson\u2019s claims that the impact leaving the EU with no deal would be tempered by a series of \u201cside deals\u201d he claimed the UK has already agreed with Brussels, as our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
