Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, asked the government what it had \u201cto hide\u201d as she demanded that No 10 approved the intelligence and security committee\u2019s dossier before parliament dissolves on Tuesday. \u201cWe are bound to ask what is Downing Street so worried about,\u201d Thornbery said. \u201cThey realise that this report will lead to other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign.\u201d Thornberry said the government was suppressing the report because it also raised awkward questions about the funding of the Tory party by Russian immigrants, and Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s controversial special adviser. She said that during three \u201cmysterious\u201d years in Russia, Cummings had \u201callegedly forged\u201d relationships with prominent Russians including Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin\u2019s chief ideologist, whom she described as \u201cthe power behind Vladimir Putin\u2019s throne\u201d. Surkov, currently serving as Putin\u2019s personal adviser, is credited with inventing the term \u201csovereign democracy\u201d to describe Russia\u2019s authoritarian system. The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014 after Russia\u2019s invasion and occupation of Crimea. During the 1990s Surkov was working for the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Thornberry also cited the \u201cdubious activities\u201d of the Conservative Friends of Russia, a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group run out of the Russian embassy by Sergey Nalobin, an alleged foreign intelligence spy, who spent five years cultivating relationships with senior Conservatives. In reply, Christopher Pincher, a foreign office minister, accused Thornberry of engaging in a \u201crundown of interesting smears and conspiracy theories\u201d. Pincher added it was \u201crather rich for her to suggest that the Conservative party and this government is somehow linked to Russian disinformation, given the way her own party leadership has acted\u201d. The minister had been summoned to the despatch box to respond to an question from Dominic Grieve, the chairman of the intelligence and security committee, who told MPs that the Russia report had already been signed off by Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies. But he warned that if Johnson was to continue to sit on the report until the end of Tuesday, when parliament is dissolved, publication would be delayed for at least six months. \u201cIf it is not laid before parliament ceases to sit, it is not capable of being laid until the committee is reformed, and in 2017 that took six months,\u201d Grieve said. He also accused Downing Street of offering \u201cbogus\u201d explanation for the delay. The 50-page Russia report was submitted on 17 October to Downing Street for Johnson\u2019s approval, and the committee\u2019s intention was that it would receive political clearance last week so that it could be published on Monday. Pincher insisted the approval time for the report from the committee was not unusual, in that it often took more than 10 working days for the final sign off from Downing Street to be obtained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
