Osby had been a Berklee student and toured with Dizzy Gillespie, but from 1985 he had joined the ranks of the anti-Marsalisites in New York's M-Base movement, looking for a jazz freed from conventional constraints. In his 40s, though, Osby has moderated his spikiness in favour of more orthodox tunes (standards and jazz classics appeared on the last two albums) and familiar methods, without sacrificing the sense of forward momentum that always marks him out. St Louis Shoes featured Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker material (with post-bop trumpeter Nicholas Payton partnering Osby), and Public was a live set of a similar persuasion. Channel Three falls somewhere between the latter and Osby's earlier work, being a more spare and instrumentally-restricted set that none the less achieves much with its plainer palette. Osby's own playing on alto sax and soprano, all Ornette Coleman-like rhythmic ingenuity, is one of the reasons why, though the collective spontaneity generated by Osby, bassist Matt Brewer and awesome drummer Jeff \"Tain\" Watts is more significant still. The opening track, Mob Job, evokes an early 1960s Ornette free-swinger, thanks to its walking bassline, Watts' edgy, arrhythmic groove and Osby's hooting, swooping alto. He develops his solo with patience, lengthening some notes into soulful trembles and trilling playfully on others, almost exactly capturing Ornette's famous descending laughter sound. Art Pepper is a more distant link, sporadically audible in Vertical Hold, while Diode Emissions is a delectable piece of sax tone-poetry partly played unaccompanied. Elsewhere Fine Tuning has the twisting, bumpy lines of his earlier work, Watts sticking to him like a limpet. The title track is a kind of abstract, avant-funk jazz ballad, with Brewer on electric bass and vocal overdubs providing ghostly sighs; Test Pattern features some scalding drumming and a constant stream of free counterpoint from Brewer. As for Miss Ann, it's an almost straight jazz swinger, Osby dancing light soprano lines across the patter of Watts' brushwork. This may be less accessible than Osby's last two albums, but it's still very musical and classy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
