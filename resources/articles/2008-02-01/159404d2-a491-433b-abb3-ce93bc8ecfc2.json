True, the New York mayor was serious about it - and I'd love to know how much he amassed in legal and consulting bills in hiring experts to look at things like ballot access rules in the 50 states. He might have done it if somehow the parties had contrived to nominate, say, Mike Huckabee and John Edwards - that is, two candidates who left a lot of room in the middle. But the odds of that happening were always long. Indeed, the parties, it appears, are doing exactly the opposite: nominating their candidates with the greatest appeal to the same moderate center that Bloomberg would have relied on. Besides, it's always been my view that Bloomberg was not one of these kinds of people who wants to run to make a point. He wanted to run to win, period. And he rightly saw that, against John McCain and Barack Obama, he couldn't. So he announces officially in today's New York Times op-ed page that he's out. But his Hamlet act has gained him some leverage, because now, as a result of all the speculation that he smartly let percolate for months, he has weight to put behind another candidate. And he suggests in the Times piece that he might: \"If a candidate takes an independent, nonpartisan approach - and embraces practical solutions that challenge party orthodoxy - I'll join others in helping that candidate win the White House.\" So, who? A Bloomberg endorsement could matter. Not so much in New York, which will go Democratic unless something really weird happens. But in other states. Like a large and valuable swing state with a substantial Jewish population, say. I think you know the one I mean. So let's read the tea leaves of Bloomberg's op-ed piece, and to some extent of his political life, and try to suss out who. Here's the first paragraph of his column: Watching the 2008 presidential campaign, you sometimes get the feeling that the candidates - smart, all of them - must know better. They must know we can't fix our economy and create jobs by isolating America from global trade. They must know that we can't fix our immigration problems with border security alone. They must know that we can't fix our schools without holding teachers, principals and parents accountable for results. They must know that fighting global warming is not a costless challenge. And they must know that we can't keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals unless we crack down on the black market for them. Let's break that down. He mentions five issues - trade, immigration, education, global warming, and guns. And on each, he hints at the kind of solution he would consider independent and responsible, and each hint points toward one candidate or the other. He's for free trade: point, McCain. He's for moderate immigration reform that refutes the right wing's fence-only approach; both candidates are associated with a moderate approach, but I read this as a warning shot to McCain not to buckle, which he has arguably already done, so I score this one as a point for Obama. On education, he means here that he wants to see Obama buck the teachers' unions, which may be unlikely, so let's give this point to McCain. He wants a president who'll risk some political capital to fight global warming: obvious point Obama. And he wants to get tough on guns. But neither candidate will do this - Obama has been very clear lately that gun control is one battle he's just not going to fight - so no points here. Tally: McCain 2, Obama 2, with one draw. So that didn't help us much. Let's look elsewhere in the piece. He talks about cities, even mentioning New Orleans. That's a tilt toward Obama. And he bemoans manufacturing losses, which cuts against his earlier free trade argument and reads like standard Democratic party rhetoric. The last half of the piece moves away from issues to discuss approach: the \"forces that prevent meaningful progress are powerful, and they exist in both parties. I believe that the candidate who recognizes that the party is over - and begins enlisting all of us to clean up the mess - will be the winner this November.\" Both Obama and McCain can make plausible claims toward this end. McCain has a longer history of going against his party on certain specific things, while Obama's entire rationale is that he'll be \"enlisting all of us\" in his presidency. So that's sort of a draw too. Hmm. Now we get to Bloomberg's political life beyond this one piece. This may only add to the confusion. He's an independent who used to be a Republican who before that was a Democrat. There are many good reasons to think that Bloomberg would prefer McCain. The two know each other, and Hizzoner (that's New York-tabloidese for \"His Honour\") probably likes McCain and respects the fact that he's fought a sometimes lonely fight inside today's GOP against the likes of the religious right. Bloomberg fought some of these fights himself while he was a Republican. But Bloomberg has really been a liberal Democrat most of his life. Remember, he became a Republican solely for mercenary reasons: when he decided to run for mayor in 2001, the GOP ballot line in New York City was free and his for the asking, while the Democratic fight card was clogged with several long-time Democratic pols. So it was a calculation that had nothing to do with ideology. His mayoral term has undoubtedly made him less of a liberal Democrat than he was eight years ago and more of a genuine independent-moderate. But he's still more liberal than not. He's pro-choice, so surely the Supreme Court would figure into his deliberations. And though he does not mention foreign policy at all in his op-ed piece, I have to think that he parts company with McCain on Iraq and the Bush Doctrine. And of course Obama will carry Bloomberg's city with about 80% of its vote, a fact Bloomberg may find it difficult to ignore. Bottom line? Obama would have to work him. But something tells me that this north-eastern Jewish liberal would be loathe to get in the way of the election of the first black president.
