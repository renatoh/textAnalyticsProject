It puts something back. It's a promise for the future; an ecological reason to think past the hellward trajectory along which we cannot control the imthis handcart world of ours is heading. Beavers, red kites or large blue butterflies each strike against the nihilism that casts nature as a something to be abused. But what we have to remember is that these are wild creatures, not just symbols or tokens which can be magicked back as if to right some historical wrongs. The most successful reintroductions are those that have avoided human agency \u2013 buzzards, ravens, polecats, wild boar \u2013 through a mixture of relief from persecution and simple chance. These species are generalists, they adapt well to a wide range of ecological circumstances. The large blue butterfly has an amazingly complicated lifecycle involving ants and dry heathland; it won't come back without help. The simplification of the countryside through industrial agricultural practices is the reason we lost so many species and caused the populations of those we still have to crash. It's no good throwing reintroductions into this countryside and pretending we are doing good when in effect we're avoiding the real problems. It is not much good trying to recreate the old countryside \u2013 that's gone. Reintroductions can be a way into a new countryside but not if we treat them like some reformed group of ageing celebrities finding a new lease of life. To create new landscapes we need the big, crashing, chew-it-up species \u2013 wild cattle, horses, elk and boar. These do the big ecological work, like beavers, changing the landscape. We also need a change in attitude that values both complexity and specialisation. So as well as the charismatic mega-fauna celebrities we need beetles, moths, mosses and funky little flies which no one can identify. The world created by ancient land-management practices has gone. Attempts to recreate it are producing an ersatz countryside at the mercy of social and economic changes. What takes centuries to create only takes a few years to destroy. Many traditional landscape features now rely entirely on the voluntary sector and government agencies to prop it up. If anything goes wrong, if funding dries up, precious landscapes such as heathland, wild flower meadows, wetlands, coppiced woodland and chalk downland will not survive. The reason for their existence, other than as deeply important cultural landscapes, have long gone. Reintroductions give a focus for these landscapes. Beavers building wetlands, bitterns booming over reed beds \u2013 these are great ambassadors for landscape-scale restoration, turning knackered farmland into big conservation areas. Lastly, reintroductions are political animals: they confront prejudice and generate a groundswell of support for ecological systems. But no one asks the animals being reintroduced. They are being used to manipulate public opinion as much as their habitats. Many conservationists think that is fine: we screwed up, we should put it right. Reintroductions are not so much ends in themselves as a means for achieving something else. Although it is not described in these terms, the battle now is to protect the nature we like from the nature we don't like."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
