A collection of bronze works by Stipe, who studied art at the University of Georgia, are being displayed for a month at the Rogan clothes shop in New York, which opens this week. The bronze pieces, which are not for sale, take the form of Polaroid cameras, a cassette tape and even a clock radio. Stipe explained that each object represented a crucial, transitional moment: \"The radio alarm clock changed forever the fragile state between sleeping and waking, allowing you to wake to your favourite radio station.\" The Polaroid brought about a revolution in photography, while tapes \"altered forever the influence of radio as the individual became their own disc jockey.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
