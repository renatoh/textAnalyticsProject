Not that Dunn is uncomfortable with being hailed as Birmingham's saviour. After the experiences of the past 12 months, which have severely tested the resolve of the 25-year-old midfielder, he is grateful for the sanctuary football provides even if it comes laced with expectation. Supporters as well as the manager have added to the pressure. \"When I go into Birmingham, I do have people saying to me all the time, 'you are going to get us out of this, aren't you?'\"he says. Not so long ago it was as much as Dunn could do to get out of bed as he recovered from spinal surgery to cure his longstanding hamstring problems. Indeed prior to the operation he had become so disillusioned with a spate of injuries that he contemplated ending his career. But after 10 months on the sidelines that led to introspection Dunn is ready to play a pivotal role in helping the club climb away from the relegation zone. There has been promise in his performances hitherto, helping to lift the gloom enveloping St Andrew's. \"It did go through my mind about retiring but I had a lot of strong people around me that kept my head right,\" he says. \"I've had the surgery and so far it's been all right but I've still a long way to go. I've been out for a year and I thought I would just be able to jump back into it and start playing again but that's not the case. But considering how long I've been out I think I'm doing pretty well.\" Against Tottenham on Boxing Day Dunn should make his fifth start in succession, a minor milestone for a player who has completed 90 minutes only three times in the last two seasons. Manchester United visit on Wednesday, followed by a trip to Chelsea on Saturday and a home match with Wigan two days later. It is hardly a schedule that will aid Dunn's rehabilitation or Birmingham's hopes of improving their dismal points tally. \"We couldn't have asked for three worse games than that,\" Dunn admits and says he has \"no chance\" of appearing in all of them. He is more optimistic about Birmingham's survival hopes, although he warns against complacency. \"A good few years back when Nottingham Forest had all those players, people were saying, 'they're too good to go down',\" he points out. \"That's rubbish. You are never too good to go down. We have got the quality to get out of it but what's important for us now is that we work our socks off because it's not going to be done without working hard.\" Dunn is familiar with that ethic, having sacrificed his summer holidays to regain fitness. Though his travails on the training ground were nothing compared with the frustration he felt when he spent three months bedridden in a lumbar brace after surgery. \"That was a pain in the arse,\" he says. \"I went back to my mum's to get spoilt. At Birmingham on my own in the flat, what would I have done? I'd have killed myself. I needed help. I was struggling even going to the toilet at first, that's how bad it was.\" Dunn, though, is not courting sympathy; he wants to look only forward, hoping to reprise the form that brought him a solitary England cap in 2002 and prompted Birmingham to pay a then club record \u00a35.5m for him the following summer. It was a considerable investment on their part and one on which they badly need a return this season. \"Of course I owe the club something,\" he concedes. \"They have been great with me; the manager, coaches and chairman have all stood by me when I was in a pretty poor state. But they know I'm honest and that I will try my arse off to get fit and to get back in. They know I'm genuine and that I want to play and, if I wasn't here now, I'd be playing football back in Great Harwood with my mates on a Sunday. That's a fact. I would be paying to play football. And I'm sure one day that will happen.\" Great Harwood is where Dunn feels most comfortable. It is where he was brought up and was also the home of his grandmother, whose death in September he has yet to come to terms with. Later that month Dunn and his actress fianc\u00e9e Sammy Winward split up only 12 weeks after the birth of their daughter, adding to the sense that 2005 has been an annus horribilis for the Birmingham midfielder. \"What the last year has showed me is that football is really important but, when things are happening outside of football, it shoves things into perspective,\" he says. \"We all want to win matches but football's not the be all and end all.\" Pandiani targeted Birmingham's Walter Pandiani, who has scored only one goal this season, has emerged as an \u00a3800,000 target for Real Mallorca. Steve Bruce confirmed yesterday that City had received an offer from the La Liga club for the Uruguay international but his sale would represent a huge loss on the \u00a33m he cost when he joined from Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a in the summer. Bruce is still weighing up his options but, if he decides to let Pandiani go, it would leave Emile Heskey and Mikael Forssell as his only recognised strikers. But the prospect of raising funds to revive an ailing team four points adrift of safety in the Premiership may tempt Birmingham to sell. \"I might have to do a bit of wheeling and dealing, so there are big decisions to be made,\" he conceded. Bruce also admitted it was \"a huge disappointment\" to miss out on the Austria defender Paul Scharner, who has joined Wigan from Brann Bergen in a \u00a32.5m deal. City matched Bergen's valuation of the player earlier this week but by then Scharner had decided to join the Latics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
