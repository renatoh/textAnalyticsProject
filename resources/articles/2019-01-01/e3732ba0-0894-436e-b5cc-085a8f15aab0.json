The president had spent the week suggesting he would \u201cprobably\u201d make such a move, but in a meeting on Friday did an about-face. \u201cWhat we\u2019re not looking to do right now is national emergency,\u201d Trump said. \u2022The president instead urged Democrats to \u201ccome back and vote\u201d in Congress in a bid to end the government shutdown. \u201cWe want Congress to do its job,\u201d Trump said in the meeting. He spent much of the summit repeating misdirections about the need for a border wall. \u2022The apparent reversal came as hundreds of thousands of workers went without pay. Miami airport closed a terminal due to a lack of TSA staff, who have been hit by the shutdown. The House passed a bill which would guarantee workers backpay, which Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Trump would sign. \u2022But despite Trump urging Democrats to vote, there does not seem an easy way out of the impasse. Democrats have insisted they will not fund the wall, which they say is unnecessary. They believe the $5.7bn would be better spent on other border measures. The White House has released this video from the meeting where Trump ditched his national emergency plan. It\u2019s full of the same spurious statements and misdirection that has characterized Trump\u2019s wall sale pitch. There is a guy wearing a cowboy hat though. Trump will likely be embarrassed about ending his very public pursuit of a national emergency. But spare a thought for Lindsey Graham, Trump foe-turned-Trump-sycophant, who was faithfully tagging along with the president\u2019s national emergency line as recently as... two hours ago. It\u2019s extra embarrassing for Graham given he had been skeptical earlier this week about whether an emergency declaration would work, before shifting behind the idea. Oops! More news is coming out re Trump\u2019s national emergency reversal. According to numerous reporters Trump said this at his cabinet meeting today: \u201cThis is where I ask the Democrats to come back to Washington and vote for money for the wall, the barrier. I don\u2019t care what they name it. They can name it peaches.\u201d That\u2019s quite a turnaround from Trump. On Thursday Trump was said to be consulting with lawyers over declaring a national emergency to appropriate money for the border wall \u2013 which would allow him to bypass Democrats in Congress. He claimed his lawyers had told him such a declaration would hold up to legal scrutiny \u201c100%\u201d. \u201cI have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. \u201cI haven\u2019t done it yet, I may do it. If this doesn\u2019t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.\u201d Now Trump is urging Democrats to \u201ccome back and vote\u201d \u2013 rather than attempting to go round them. \u201cWe want Congress to do its job,\u201d Trump said on Friday. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions that he would be able to declare an emergency, legal scholars have questioned the president\u2019s right to take such action. That legal ambiguity could have contributed to this about turn from Trump. Donald Trump said on Friday that he does not plan to declare a national emergency \u2013 a day after suggesting he would \u201cprobably\u201d do so. Speaking at a cabinet meeting over the government shutdown and the border wall, Trump said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re not looking to do right now is national emergency.\u201d The president instead urged Democrats to \u201ccome back and vote\u201d in Congress in a bid to end the government shutdown. Trump insisted he had the right to declare an emergency, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it so fast\u201d, according to a White House pool reporter. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has \u201cno evidence\u201d of remaining cancer, the Supreme Court said on Friday. In a statement the court said: \u201cPost-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required.\u201d Ginsburg had surgery in December to remove two nodules from her lung. \u201cJustice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments,\u201d the court said. Steve King, the Republican congressman and Trump ally who on Thursday said he didn\u2019t understand why the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was offensive, has declared himself an \u201cAmerican nationalist\u201d in a House speech. In an interview with the New York Times King had said: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d In his speech on Friday King did not dispute the quote. He said he was \u201can advocate for Western values\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve never been anti-immigrant, I\u2019ve been anti-illegal immigrant and I remain that way,\u201d King said. He described himself as \u201can advocate for western civilization\u2019s values\u201d and said: \u201cUnder any fair political definition, I am simply an American nationalist.\u201d He added: \u201cThis conviction does not make me a white nationalist or white supremacist.\u201d King, who has long been criticized for statements perceived as racist, had drawn ire for telling the New York Times: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d He added: \u201cWhy did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u201d The president\u2019s first born son has been tweeting some sage advice in the middle of the government shutdown... Oh no wait: he\u2019s actually been re-posting this video of a CNN figure getting run over by a golf cart. Donald Trump has not built a single mile of new wall so far. Also this is stretching the definition of \u2018beautiful\u2019. The House has passed a bill which would guarantee backpay to federal workers who have been impacted by the shutdown. The measure passed in the Senate last night. According to Mitch McConnell, Trump has said he will sign it. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers went unpaid today. Senate Democrats are also drafting a bill which would ensure government contractors, who have gone unpaid during the shutdown, would also get their money. S&amp;P Global estimate that the border wall shutdown has already cost the economy $3.6bn, and in another two weeks will have cost $6bn. Keen watchers will note that $6bn is more than the $5.7bn that Trump is demanding to build the wall. \u201cWe estimated that this shutdown could shave approximately $1.2 billion off real GDP in the quarter for each week that part of the government is closed,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, S&amp;P\u2019s chief US economist, said in a widely circulated memo. \u201cThat may seem like pennies for the world\u2019s biggest economy, but it means a lot to those workers trying to cover their household costs without their paychecks.\u201d According to CNBC, Wells Fargo estimates the shutdown could be costing as much as $2bn a week. An apparent response from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to that Politico article... citing hirsute British graphic novelist Alan Moore. Moore is known for his work on comic books such as Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Donald Trump\u2019s on deck, performing his greatest hits. Featuring Cryin\u2019 Chuck, Wall, and So Much Other Big Trouble. A terminal at Miami International airport will be closed this weekend due to a lack of Transportation Security Administration workers. Security checkpoints at Terminal G, one of six at the airport, will close at 1pm Saturday, reopen on Sunday morning, then shut again at 1pm on Sunday afternoon. Travelers are also being encouraged to arrive extra early \u201cdue to uncertainties created by the lapse in federal government funding\u201d. \u201cWe felt we had to make a decision before the weekend,\u201d said Greg Chin. \u201cThey\u2019re erring on the side of caution.\u201d Chin said if the shutdown continues the airport may have to close checkpoints at two more terminals. A statement on the Miami airport website suggests checking TSA.gov for more info, but the TSA website has not been updated since December 21 \u2013 due to the shutdown. Democrats are apparently trying to rein in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, using an approach which Politico says is \u201cpart carrot, part stick\u201d. But at the same time, many are fearful of the New Yorker, with some reportedly comparing her influence to that of Donald Trump. Lawmakers and aides are said to be urging Ocasio-Cortez to rein in her attacks on fellow Democrats \u2013 in November the congresswoman said she would support an effort to recruit left-leaning primary challengers to incumbents \u2013 and warning her she needs to play along to get along. Democratic congressman Emanuel Cleaver told Politico that he was \u201csure Ms. Cortez means well, but there\u2019s almost an outstanding rule: Don\u2019t attack your own people\u201d. He added: \u201cWe just don\u2019t need sniping in our Democratic Caucus.\u201d Two House Democratic sources compared her use of Twitter to Donald Trump\u2019s. Just as congressional Republicans constantly withhold criticism of the president out of fear he\u2019ll unleash a tweet at them, some Democrats have done the same with Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cPeople are afraid of her,\u201d said one senior Democratic aide. The latest edition of the Guardian\u2019s podcast, Today in Focus, addresses the shutdown. Tune in to hear Lauren Gambino, in Washington DC, and Bryan Mealer, in Texas, discuss how Trump\u2019s central campaign promise has led to this point of paralysis. So what\u2019s Trump up to this morning? So far, he\u2019s continuing the lie that Mexico is paying for the border wall. According to the non-partisan factcheck.org (and numerous other fact checkers) this is false. But here we go: Later on \u2013 at 2.30pm \u2013 Trump will be holding a public cabinet meeting about border security. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the day\u2019s politics news. Hundreds of thousands of people will miss their paychecks today as the government shutdown rolls on. It\u2019s the first payday that federal workers will forego due to the impasse. That comes as the deadlock between Donald Trump and Democratic leaders over $5.7bn funding for a border wall shows no sign of coming to an end. Trump is continuing to explore options which don\u2019t require negotiation, however. Specifically, the president is exploring a national emergency declaration, which would enable him to swipe government money without the approval of Congress. According to reports, Trump fancies taking money for his wall from money earmarked for disaster recovery. He could nab funding from the Army Corps of Engineers budget. The Washington Post says Trump \u201chas urged the Army Corps\u201d to determine how quickly they can get building contracts signed. In other news, the US has begun withdrawing troops from Syria. A spokesman for the US-led coalition against Isis said the withdrawl had begun but offered no further details. Trump surprised many with his abrupt announcement of the pull out last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
