Cannabis smoking, however, will still be permitted. San Francisco\u2019s board of supervisors passed the ban on tobacco and e-cigarette smoking in apartments 10-1 on Wednesday. The amendment exempting cannabis passed 8-3, with the board president, Norman Yee, the overall ordinance\u2019s author, among the dissenting votes. \u201cWhile there are great benefits to cannabis, there are still health risks in exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke,\u201d he said. The original legislation before the board had sought to exempt only medicinal cannabis users from the indoor smoking ban, but the board voted to exclude marijuana smoking in general because state law prohibits cannabis users from smoking in public places. An ordinance restricting cannabis smoking in apartments would take away cannabis users\u2019 only legal place to smoke, argued Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, who wrote the amendment to exempt cannabis. \u201cTobacco smokers and cannabis smokers are fundamentally in a different position under state law,\u201d Mandelman said. \u201cTobacco smokers, unable to smoke in their apartment building, can go out to the curb. There are other public spaces where they\u2019re allowed to smoke. Cannabis smokers don\u2019t have that alternative.\u201d In a letter to the legislative body, Dr Donald Abrams, an oncologist at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote: \u201cSecondhand cannabis smoke has not been proven to be harmful to humans.\u201d \u201cCannabis smoke has never been linked to increased mortality, even in firsthand users,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNor has firsthand cannabis smoke been shown to cause lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other serious health effects.\u201d The anti-smoking ordinance must pass a second vote next week before the mayor signs it into law. Should all go to plan, it will go into effect 30 days later. The ordinance will be enforced by the department of public health, which may issue fines of up to $1,000 for repeat offenders. Violations will not be grounds for eviction. Secondhand smoke causes more than 41,000 deaths a year in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). San Francisco now joins 63 California cities and counties with a ban on tobacco smoking in apartments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
