Every Christian marriage book and seminar had made it seem as though men always wanted sex and wives should submit to that. But my husband had a significantly lower libido. I was baffled and felt rejected. After more than a decade of counselling, medication for depression, prayer and fighting, nothing seemed to solve this issue. My husband is wonderful, but this one issue left me feeling lonely, undesirable and depressed. Then an old friend approached me: he wasn\u2019t in the headspace to be romantically involved with anyone but, like me, craved sexual intimacy. So, with my husband\u2019s blessing, I am now engaging in polyandry: one woman, two men. The Bible does speak of polygamy, accepting that a man can have multiple wives or concubines \u2013 but not the other way around. I won\u2019t justify my actions in any religious context. But I will say that this arrangement has done wonders for my physical and mental health. I still have sex with my husband, and our relationship couldn\u2019t be better. I am grateful. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com.
