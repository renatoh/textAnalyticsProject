The first signs of trouble usually occur as the outcome of the championship comes into sharper focus and the title fight narrows to two equally matched teams. This year it is Red Bull and Brawn GP. The good news for both is that they have the same impending difficulty. Red Bull's dilemma is more acute, Mark Webber's recent win in Germany taking the Australian to within 1.5 points of Sebastian Vettel. Brawn's situation would appear less delicate since Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello are split by the Red Bull drivers and separated by 24 points. But aggravation is never far away, judging by Barrichello's outburst after leading the German grand prix, but finishing sixth. Brawn were always likely to be beaten because of problems with the interaction of car and tyres in the low temperatures but no one, least of Barrichello, expected the handicap to be so severe. Barrichello quickly retracted his hasty remarks when presented with evidence that showed he was slower than Button. The Brazilian's frustration came from being the only one of the four not to have won this season but Brawn will be aware that there may be more of the same from Barrichello until such time as the points total settles any dispute over precedence. Barrichello's irritation over being unable to capitalise on equal status is also prefaced by having spent six years at Ferrari where Michael Schumacher was the undisputed No1, even on the rare occasions when Barrichello was faster. Such a policy may make life clear-cut within the team but it denies the standard of entertainment currently being enjoyed as team-mates fight among themselves as well as the opposition. Advocates of the Schumacher monopoly point to 1986 when Williams allowed Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet to race as they pleased and take points off each other, only to have Alain Prost, the outsider, steal the title at the final race. Despite the disappointment \u2013 and losing the supply of Honda engines as a result \u2013 Patrick Head, co-founder and technical chief at Williams, has insisted on continuing the free-for-all tradition that has led to his team winning 16 world championships. \"Honda weren't impressed,\" recalled Head. \"They said if we hadn't been fair to both drivers, we would have won the 1986 championship. But what's the point of justifying what you do? That's what we did. We had a situation in 1981 when Carlos Reutemann and Alan Jones had a dispute over who should win the Brazilian grand prix, but it didn't affect the atmosphere in the team. If you allow yourself to get sucked into drivers' little vendettas, you're in real trouble. I don't think that happens quite so much these days. It only happens when you have two guys who can take positions from each other.\" That is precisely the situation Red Bull may find themselves in, judging by Webber's desire to make the most of what could be his only tilt at the title while racing a team-mate 11 years his junior. For the moment, however, Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, is happy to allow the potential entertainment to continue until the maths dictate otherwise. \"We will continue to support both drivers equally,\" said Horner. \"There's only a point and a half between them, so obviously they are both in contention for the drivers' championship. If and when we reach a point where there is a significant gap, or it becomes mathematically impossible for one of them to challenge for the championship, then they are both team players and one of them will play a supporting role should it be required. \"Our intention is to see both of them catch the lead Brawn as quickly as possible. Our drivers are at the top of their game at different stages in their career and pushing one another very hard. I think we've got the best driver line-up in F1. Both men are being treated with total fairness within the team and are supplied with identical equipment.\" Barrichello may think otherwise from time to time but the same code prevails within Brawn. \"The key to the rest of the season is that, if we cannot beat Red Bull, we keep as few cars between us as possible,\" said Ross Brawn. \"Teams like McLaren, Ferrari and Renault have started to show the pace we expect from them, so their challenge is growing. I am confident that we have the people and resources, plus two excellent drivers, to respond and fight to maintain our position.\" The last thing Brawn needs is internal confrontation. If Barrichello wins tomorrow, the situation could become tricky. But if Button extends his advantage, the potential nightmare will recede. Either way, it is an age-old predicament many teams would be willing to experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
