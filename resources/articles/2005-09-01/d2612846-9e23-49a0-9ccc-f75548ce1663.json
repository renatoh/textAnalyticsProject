Peter Kenyon, the Chelsea chief executive, Keith Edelman, Arsenal's managing director, and Karl Evans, United's director of venue, are joining the Premier League's Attendance Working Group who will discuss the problems of declining attendances, saturation television coverage and high ticket prices. Richard Scudamore, the league's chief executive who chairs the group, has recruited the trio in order to seek ways of freshening the league's appeal. They meet for the first time this season early next month to continue examining what effect prices, kick-off times, travel difficulties and live TV coverage are having on crowd numbers. They replace representatives of last season's relegated trio, Norwich City, Crystal Palace and Southampton. The attendances group has concentrated so far on seeking to encourage large numbers of away fans, who have been dwindling since the start of last season. But the group will expand its remit to consider what measures could be taken by clubs to woo new fans and make it easier for young people, families and lower earners to watch matches live. Some club chairmen and chief executives have floated the idea of clubs setting aside a quota of tickets that have to be sold to those who cannot afford usual prices. Scudamore said the group's eventual recommendations would have to be approved by all 20 clubs before they were implemented. It was 'premature' to judge the league's popularity based on games played so far, he said. Charlton's chief executive Peter Varney, a member of the group, said he wanted fewer midweek games in which one set of fans has to travel a long distance, such as his club's 7.45pm kick-off at Newcastle on 28 December. Blackburn chairman John Williams, another member, said the best way to improve the Premiership was to divide TV income more evenly among the 20 clubs, to help narrow the financial gap. However, the representatives of England's unofficial 'big three' are sure to resist any moves to alter the funding formula, which has not changed since the Premiership's creation in 1992."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
