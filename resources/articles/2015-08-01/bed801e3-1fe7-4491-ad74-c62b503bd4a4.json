In response to a letter signed by Eric Bland and Robert Richter, attorneys for the family of Zachary Hammond, the Department of Justice announced on Wednesday that it was launching a civil rights investigation into the 26 July police shooting that left the unarmed Hammond dead. Hammond was shot behind the wheel of his car during an attempted drug sting by the Seneca police department in the parking lot of a Hardee\u2019s restaurant. Police said Hammond tried to hit Lieutenant Mark Tiller as the officer approached the vehicle, forcing the officer to fire. Hammond\u2019s family has insisted that his vehicle was not moving, and that the officer shot at him from behind. But Bland said on Monday that the current Justice Department investigation may not go far enough. Bland told the Guardian that the request for federal oversight is not only about what happened to Hammond, but potentially about systemic problems with the department, its officers and its chief. The department has confirmed that one officer who was on the scene the night Hammond was shot has resigned. Citing sources in Seneca city government, Bland said another officer resigned on Friday. The department denied this to the Guardian. Bland and Richter\u2019s letter, which called the investigation of Hammond\u2019s death \u201cinadequate\u201d, also raised questions about Seneca police chief John Covington\u2019s 27-year-old son Adam, a former reserve officer with the Seneca police department who pleaded guilty to charges of theft of a controlled substance and misconduct in office on Thursday. Covington received two years\u2019 probation and one year in prison with credit for time already served. The charges stemmed from allegations that Covington stole 44 hydrocodone pills from a suspect\u2019s purse at the Oconee County detention center after a January 2014 arrest. An investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (Sled) found several incidents in which reserve officer Covington was suspected of similar misconduct. During a 2013 burglary investigation, Covington allegedly told a colleague not to fingerprint several emptied bottles of pills because \u201call the officers had picked them up and touched them\u201d. All the other officers on the scene were subsequently interviewed, and denied touching the bottles. The Sled report depicts multiple department officials hesitant to investigate allegations against reserve officer Covington, because of his relationship to the chief. One captain is quoted as having said \u201cthis came straight from the big man that if you go forward with this it would be a career-changing move\u201d, regarding any investigation of the 2013 burglary incident. In a separate incident, reserve officer Covington was suspected of having stolen $600 from a suspect\u2019s vehicle. The Oconee County sheriff\u2019s office was asked to investigate, but Chief Covington rejected the investigator\u2019s request for officers to submit to polygraph testing. \u201cAdam can\u2019t pass a polygraph anyways,\u201d the chief is reported to have said. \u201cWhen you have a police chief\u2019s son who is on the reserve police force and is accused of taking drugs from the detainees, that\u2019s a real problem; when you have money missing, that is a real problem,\u201d Bland said. The letter suggested that Adam Covington\u2019s legal status could have been connected to the drug sting which ended in Hammond\u2019s death. Tori Morton, the passenger in Hammond\u2019s car that night, and the target of the sting \u201chad additional criminal information regarding Adam Covington\u201d, according to the letter. The department denied any connection to the Guardian. Citing law enforcement sources in a neighboring department, Bland and Richter claim in the letter that officers on the scene \u201cdesecrated\u201d Hammond\u2019s body, raising his hand and high-fiving it. The letter also revealed an eyewitness who claims to have seen an officer retrieve something from the back of a patrol car and place it under Hammond\u2019s body after he had been removed from the vehicle. Bland and Richter suggest that this may explain the \u201cwhite powdery substance consistent with powder cocaine\u201d found on Hammond\u2019s body. Citing the ongoing investigation, Sled has declined to release footage from a dash camera on the scene. It isn\u2019t clear whether that camera captured the fatal shots fired by Tiller The Seneca police have denied all allegations of misconduct by officers at the scene of Hammond\u2019s death, and Chief Covington has stated that no further comments will be made while the investigation is ongoing. \u2022 The story was updated on 19 August with comment from the Seneca police department."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
