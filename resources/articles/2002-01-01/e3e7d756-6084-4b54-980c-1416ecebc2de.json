The government's tinkering will have added to the \u00a3331m annual cost to local authorities of administering housing benefits, which are received by more than 4m households. Poor households have their rents paid entirely; low income families get graduated support. Added complexity may have made fraud easier; losses to housing benefit from dishonesty are estimated at between \u00a3200m and \u00a3600m a year. Until October last year, some 74 separate housing benefit circulars were issued by the Department of Work and Pensions, compared with 73 in 2000. That year alone five separate sets of benefit regulations were published. According to the Department of Work and Pensions minister, Malcolm Wicks, the changes were needed to support Labour's welfare reform. But, embarrassed by these disclosures which were winkled out of the department by the Liberal Democrats, he announced before Christmas that the government was establishing a \"regulation scrutiny group\" to try to cut the burden of paperwork on councils. Under the Tories during the 1990s an average of 10 statutory instruments containing new housing benefit regulations were made each year. Under Labour this has increased to 18. Payments administration in some local authorities has all but collapsed, partly as a result of the rule changes. Last October, the audit commission published a severely critical report complaining of \"long delays\" in payments and a scheme \"tarnished by error, waste and fraud\". The Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman, Steve Webb, said yesterday that the government had to stop its continuous \"fiddling\" and leave councils alone long enough for them to get on with the job of providing housing benefits to people in need. \"In nearly five years, the government has achieved nothing of any significance. It is now time for a period of calm before the systematic reform that is long overdue.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
