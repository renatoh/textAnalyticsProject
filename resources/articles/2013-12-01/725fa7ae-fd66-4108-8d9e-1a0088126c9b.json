Instead, the 28-year-old says that referees have the responsibility to make correct decisions. Young has been embroiled in several controversial diving episodes during his United career, with the former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, accepting that the winger can go down too easily. This season, during the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in September, Young was booked for diving in the area by Jon Moss before the official later adjudged he was fouled by Kagisho Dikgacoi, who was sent off as United won a penalty. Last month David Moyes said he would speak to Young \u2013 as he also stated following the match against Palace \u2013 after he won a penalty when playing against Real Sociedad, taking a tumble in the area from a faint tug by Markel Bergara. Asked if he realises he has attracted a reputation for diving, Young said: \"Of course I understand what you're saying and everyone is going to have their say on it, but I've spoken to the previous manager and current manager, the referees are giving decisions and that is where I think it lies. It's been talked about [to me] but that's in-house. I'm not going to comment on what's been said. \"I think it's one to ask the referees \u2013 they're the ones who are giving free-kicks and penalties. I remember getting booked against Palace and then won a penalty. Against Real Sociedad it was another penalty that was given. Referees have got tough decisions to make, they have a tough time out there making decisions, but they have made the right decisions, I think.\" Young denied being affected by negative publicity. \"I don't take notice of the headlines or the debates,\" he said. \"That's obviously for the media to debate and people to have their say on it and everyone is entitled to have their say on it. For me, the referees have made decisions and that's it.\" So far, Young's season has been uneven, with him not always being selected by Moyes but after starting Tuesday's 1-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk, which confirmed United as Group A winners before next week's knockout stage draw, he is determined to find consistent form that would also secure a place in Roy Hodgson's England squad for the 2014 World Cup. \"You always want to play in the biggest tournaments, whether that's at club level or international level,\" said Young. \"So of course I want to be on that plane. Right now I'm not thinking about the World Cup, I'm thinking about playing for United. Obviously, it's been disappointing I've not been involved as much as I would have liked. Every player in the squad wants to play and I'm no different to that but it's up to the manager, so I've just got to keep doing the things that are right in training and take my chances when I'm given them \u2013 we'll have to see if the manager picks me again.\" United travel to Young's previous club, Aston Villa, on Sunday, with the champions 13 points behind the leaders, Arsenal, and seven from a Champions League berth. Having lost their last two league games 1-0, Young is conscious the side have to refocus. He said: \"We want to build some momentum, we're going into an important part of the season at Christmas and new year, which are full of games. We have got plenty of points to pick up so I think if we can build on this result we could keep the momentum going all the way through to the new year.\" He is expecting a hostile reaction at Villa Park. \"Yeah, of course I am. I don't mind a bit of stick when I go back there but I'm delighted with how [the Shakhtar match has] gone and we'll build on the result and look forward to Sunday's game,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
