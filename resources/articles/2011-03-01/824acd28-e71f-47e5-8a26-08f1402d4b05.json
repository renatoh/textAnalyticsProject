The presence of the reigning champion, Big Buck's, as well as Grands Crus at the head of the betting takes out a huge chunk of the market, with everything else at 10-1 or bigger. But Mourad (3.20) has just the right blend of speed and stamina to make an impact in this contest and, with the rain forecast to stay away until Friday, the ground also promises to suit. His stablemate Fiveforthree shouldn't be ruled out either, despite the fact that he was returning from nearly two years off when beating lower-rated rivals in a recent race. The best of his previous form would make him look very exciting at a double-figure price. Yes, Big Buck's is an admirable and gutsy performer who won't take defeat easily, and Grands Crus is potentially one of the best staying hurdlers seen for a long time. But neither deserve to be as short in the betting against rivals who could well prove up to the grade. 1.30 Jewson Chase A bad blunder three out saw Robinson Collonges forfeit all chance at this track in December, his effort petering out alarmingly quickly. But he had travelled notably well to that point and is worth another chance on the back of a break since, given that he had looked to be getting the better of Wishfull Thinking when the pair met at Wincanton the previous month. 2.05 Pertemps Hurdle Old hand Gwanako doesn't have the same sort of profile as some of his more lightly raced rivals, but looks the type to go well at a big price. Steady late progress saw him finish fourth to Ashkazar at this track on New Year's Day over three miles, just behind the strongly fancied Chartreux. 2.40 Ryanair Chase Recent market support has seen much of the juice squeezed out of Poquelin's price but he sets a standard which will be hard to match. Second in this contest last year, he improved on that form with a fine weight-carrying performance in a hot handicap here in December, since when he has been kept for this. 4.00 Byrne Group Plate The handicapper has put a stop to Quartz De Thaix's winning run over hurdles, but his lower mark over fences makes him of considerable interest here. Even a 5lb penalty obtained for an effortless success in a Newton Abbot novice chase earlier this month leaves him well-in at these weights and the jumping problems he suffered from when first going steeplechasing last season appear to have been ironed out, on recent evidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
