To celebrate, we\u2019ve rounded up 10 Australian books that explore the many different aspects of queer identity and indicate the experimental, creative and analytical writing taking place in LGBT+ communities. In the current political climate, many people have questions about diverse gender identities and sexualities. The books on this list, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, young adult books and a children\u2019s picture book, offer readers opportunities to be entertained, informed and moved. Children\u2019s and young adult fiction A House for Everyone: A Story to help Children learn about Gender Identity and Gender Expression by Jo Hirst (Jessica Kingsley Publishers) For fans of Jessica Walton\u2019s Introducing Teddy, Vivek Shraya\u2019s The Boy &amp; the Bindi A powerful follow-up to The Gender Fairy, this children\u2019s picture book breaks down gender stereotypes and identities in a relatable, inclusive story that is easy for children to understand. Set in a school playground, a group of children work to build a house together. The engaging story could be used as an educational resource to introduce the topic of gender identity, either individually or in a classroom. Highway Bodies by Alison Evans (Echo) For fans of The Walking Dead Regardless of how you feel about post-apocalyptic survival stories or zombies, this is a must-read. A group of queer and gender diverse teens learn to rely on each other, against a backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. Evans\u2019s first novel, Ida, won the Victorian Premier\u2019s People\u2019s Choice award in 2017, and it is clear both books have found their niche; bleak settings that capture the beauty and diversity in queer relationships and found family. Prisoncorp by Marlee Jane Ward (Brio Books) For fans of Veronica Roth\u2019s Divergent series This is the final instalment of Ward\u2019s dystopian series, following the prize-winning novella Welcome to Orphancorp and its sequel, Psynode. In the first installation, 17-year-old Mirii Mahoney is about to age out of the brutal orphanage Orphancorp, while in this one she is held in a harsh desert prison. The trilogy follows Mirii\u2019s experiences of escape and rebellion, and many of the characters in the book are queer and gender diverse. It is both an engaging story and a biting social commentary for young people and adults alike. Kindred: 12 Queer #LoveOzYA Stories edited by Michael Earp (Walker Books) For fans of Rebecca Lim\u2019s Meet Me at the Intersection Earp has brought together 12 LGBTQ+ authors to write young adult short stories for this remarkable collection, including Jax Jacki Brown, Christos Tsiolkas, Benjamin Law, Ellen van Neerven and Nevo Zisin. While it includes writers of diverse sexualities and genders, including First Nations writers, writers who identity as people of colour, and disabled writers,it does not include intersex, asexual or aromantic narratives. However, it is undoubtedly the book that many will wish they had when they were younger as it portrays the diverse range of life experiences of young queer Australians without fixating on the traditional coming-out narrative. How it Feels to Float by Helena Fox (Dial Books) For fans of Patrick Ness\u2019s The Rest of Us Just Live Here Fox\u2019s debut young adult fiction novel is a poignant look at grief, mental illness, love and friendship. Biz sees and converses with her late father, who died when she was seven, which contributes to her unravelling. The rich and poetic prose captures Biz\u2019s suffering, and those living with mental illness or caring for loved ones will find Fox\u2019s depiction powerful and realistic, if not excruciatingly accurate. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Amelia Westlake by Erin Gough (Hardie Grant Egmont) For fans of Alice Pung\u2019s Laurinda, Erin Gough\u2019s debut The Flywheel, David Levithan\u2019s The Realm of Possibility This playful and gripping young adult novel is set in a sexist, racist and homophobic Sydney private school. Bad girl Wilhelmina and preppy Harriet Price devise a plan to expose the inappropriate and misogynistic behaviour of their teacher through a series of pranks. Readers seeking representation of queer identities and feminism in a high school setting will be delighted by the twists and turns, the characters\u2019 activism and, more than likely, the budding romance. Adult fiction and nonfiction The Man on the Mantelpiece: A Memoir by Marion May Campbell (UWA Publishing) For fans of Jeanette Winterson\u2019s Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? Marion May Campbell\u2019s must-read memoir is about the traumatic fallout from her father\u2019s death at the age of 37 when his aircraft came down during an electrical storm. Frederick William Campbell was a CSIRO scientist involved in trials to create artificial rain for drought-stricken areas. After a thoughtful explanatory prologue, the book propels the reader into the action of past events and Campbell\u2019s attempts to grapple with the loss of her father with tremendous skill. Campbell\u2019s writing is both tightly controlled and experimental, while the personal stories are tenderly researched and interwoven with history. An important addition to Australian historical, literary and queer biographies. The Lost Arabs by Omar Sakr (UQP) For fans of Ellen van Neerven\u2019s Comfort Food, Quinn Eades\u2019 Rallying Omar Sakr\u2019s latest poetry collection is as thrilling as it is accomplished. It is rare for such a collection to be a page-turner but his poetry demands to be read, digested and re-read soon after. Sakr\u2019s evident confidence as a poet allows him to deftly juggle themes around family, faith, sexuality, identity and belonging. The collection looks set to make its mark internationally with publisher UQP recently selling the English-language rights in the United States. Colouring the Rainbow: Blak Queer and Trans Perspectives edited by Dino Hodge (Wakefield Press) For fans of Ellen van Neerven\u2019s Heat and Light The essays by 22 First Nations writers in this vital collection range in tone, style and structure but the moving themes, ideas and experiences will resonate with many readers. The collection brings together ideas about gender, sexuality, race and identity that should be considered in contemporary debates and discussions about queer communities, especially in relation to future directions for policy, curriculum and inclusion practices. Queerstories: Reflections on Lives Well Lived from some of Australia\u2019s Finest LGBTQIA+ Writers edited by Maeve Marsden (Hachette Australia) For fans of Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli\u2019s anthology Living and Loving in Diversity This collection of essays lives up to its evocative title. Writers including Nayuka Gorrie, Candy Bowers, Kelly Azizi, Mama Alto, Rebecca Shaw and the late Candy Royalle share stories that vary from intimate confessions and personal reflections to politically charged and historically connected pieces exploring oppression. An excellent reflection of Australia\u2019s contemporary queer, transgender and gender diverse writing scene."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
