At the annual shareholders' meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway, the self-styled Woodstock for capitalists, Mr Buffett also said he intends to maintain his bet against the US dollar and criticised plans to turn the New York Stock Exchange into a public company. In a typically wide-ranging session, he also came to the defence of America's less well off, launching an attack with vice chairman Charles Munger on President Bush's plans to privatise social security. The annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, is unlike any other. Mr Buffett treats his admiring investors to a song and performs on film in skits. He said the company is holding $45bn (\u00a325bn) in cash and apart from an unnamed insurance firm worth less than $1bn, has no significant acquisitions in sight. Of late the company has shifted emphasis from stock market investments to owning businesses outright. He said buyout funds and hedge funds were driving up asset prices and making acquisitions difficult. \"At the moment we've got more money than brains, and we hope to do something about that,\" he said. \"The test is whether the money can be used very successfully within the business.\" Mr Buffett parried questions about the involvement of Berkshire 's General Re in an insurance scandal that toppled Hank Greenberg, the head of the world's largest insurer American International Group, though he did come to AIG's defence, telling 19,000 shareholders that it was a \"great company\" and Mr Greenberg was \"the number one man in insurance\". In the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has more than doubled its bet against the US dollar, increasing its ownership of foreign currencies to $21bn. Mr Buffett has been betting against the greenback since 2002 amid concerns about America's widening trade and budget deficits. Despite losing $310m on his currency positions in the first quarter, he said: \"I have a hard time thinking about any outcome from this that involves an appreciating dollar.\" On the NYSE Mr Munger, who forms a double act with Mr Buffett, said: \"I don't think you want to turn the stock exchange into an even larger casino than it is already.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
