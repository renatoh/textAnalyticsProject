Prosus is seeking to break up the agreed merger between Just Eat and Dutch rival Takeaway.com, a deal that would create one of the world\u2019s biggest online food delivery companies. Prosus, the Amsterdam-listed offshoot of South African technology group Naspers, launched a rival 710p a share cash offer in October and has raised its terms to 740p a share, further above Takeaway.com\u2019s \u00a34.8bn offer. Prosus argued that its bid was \u201cthe only one that delivers certainty in the face of undeniable industry change\u201d. Just Eat said its board was studying the increased offer, and advised shareholders to take no action. Shares in the business closed up slightly on Monday, gaining 4p to 781p. The Prosus chief executive, Bob van Dijk, said: \u201cWe have had the opportunity to listen to the views of Just Eat shareholders, share our perspective on the global food delivery sector and reflect on the unquestionable challenges Just Eat faces, as clearly seen in its third quarter results. \u201cWe have also had extensive discussions with our own shareholders with regards to our long term strategy for food delivery and Just Eat\u2019s role within that.\u201d Prosus reduced the level of acceptances required from 75% to a simple majority (50% plus one Just Eat share). Shareholders have until 1pm on 27 December to make up their minds. Takeaway.com insisted its all-share offer remains \u201cfar superior\u201d. Jitse Groen, its chief executive, said: \u201cA slightly higher derisory cash bid remains a derisory cash bid.\u201d The board of Just Eat has continued to recommend the Dutch offer despite higher terms from Prosus. Cat Rock, a top 10 Just Eat shareholder, is maintaining its backing for Takeaway.com\u2019s bid, saying it would only support Prosus if its offer were raised to 925p a share. Alex Captain, Cat Rock\u2019s founder and managing partner, said: \u201cProsus continues to dramatically undervalue Just Eat. \u201cWe think a Prosus cash bid needs to be at least five times 2020 consensus revenue, or 925p per share, in order to compete with a Takeaway.com merger that we believe could comfortably be worth 1,200p per share by the end of 2020.\u201d Prosus became Europe\u2019s biggest listed consumer internet firm when it floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange with a value of more than \u20ac100bn (\u00a384bn) in September, and is controlled by Naspers, one of Africa\u2019s most valuable companies. With growing competition from Uber Eats and Deliveroo, there have been a number of deals in the fast-growing online food delivery market. Just Eat bought UK rival HungryHouse in January 2018, while Takeaway.com acquired Delivery Hero\u2019s food delivery business in Germany last December. Prosus has a 22% stake in the DeliveryHero business outside Europe, alongside holdings in India\u2019s Swiggy and iFood in Latin America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
