December might herald Christmas With The Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, on Nine, but over the summer the broadcaster is also airing new episodes of underrated thriller Person of Interest and guilty pleasure The Mentalist. Seven has new episodes of television\u2019s best reality series, The Amazing Race, while Foxtel is launching the third season of Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls and the local premiere of Connie Britton\u2019s soapy US drama, Nashville. The ABC will air season three of Portlandia, while SBS debuts excellent Aden Young drama Rectify in early February. And Ten will, of course, allow us to continue hate-watching new episodes of Homeland through until Christmas, plus the extraordinary American Horror Story: Coven. They\u2019ve even dispensed with tennis\u2019s yawn fest, the Hopman Cup. Which is already enough to be going on with \u2013 and that\u2019s before we get to these 10 summer viewing highlights: Scandal Seven, Thursdays, 9.30pm Although Shonda Rhimes\u2019s soapy political thriller is the most buzz-worthy free-to-air series in the US right now, Seven has struggled to build an audience for it locally. The network is now promising to persist with it through summer on Thursdays. The series, focusing on political fixer Olivia Pope, played with theatrical flourish by Kerry Washington, is highly addictive. It\u2019s also perfect summer froth. Borgen SBS One, Wednesdays, 9.30pm Although it arrived in Australia almost three years after originally airing in its home country, the Australian debut of excellent Danish political drama Borgen felt almost prescient. It was hard not to embrace Birgitte Nyborg. This charismatic but low-key leader is thrust into a job that irrevocably alters her life \u2013 and that of her family. You can catch season two of this intelligent, well-paced and incredibly addictive drama through summer on SBS. (Catch up here). The IT Crowd series finale ABC1, December 11 Few series encapsulated the inane absurdity intrinsic to corporate work life than Graham Linehan\u2019s cult classic. A launching pad for the wonderful talents of Chris O\u2019Dowd and Richard Ayoade, it never outstayed its welcome. Three years after the fourth season concluded, we finally get an hour-long finale episode. Ominously titled The Internet Is Coming, it aired in September in the UK. Safe to say there will be some resolution for Roy, Moss and Jen. Suits Seven, from mid-December Chronically underrated in Australia, this razor-sharp American drama is also under-appreciated in its home market. Set in a New York law firm, Suits centres on alpha male Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), his youthful sidekick Mike Ross (Patrick Adams) and a group of preening rivals and colleagues. It is cleverly written, smart and frequently funny. Seven is about to begin airing the show\u2019s third season over the summer non-ratings period. The Network SBS One, December 17 This could be the pick of SBS\u2019s typically impressive collection of summer documentaries. Members of an Australian-based, Afghanistan-raised family returned to their home country to assist with rebuilding after several years of severe media restrictions under the Taliban regime were lifted. The result was TOLO TV, a network that has grown to become a powerhouse in Afghanistan. This documentary is from the Oscar-winning Australian producer Eva Orner and examines not only the rise of TOLO TV but the implications for it when conditions again began to deteriorate. The Agony of Christmas ABC1, December 18 The ABC is teeming with seasonal specials. Christmas With Poh (December 17) stars the irrepressibly ebullient Aussie chef; Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries: Murder Under The Mistletoe (December 22) is self-explanatory; and so too are Christmas-themed editions of local quiz show Tractor Monkeys (December 25), Doctor Who and Call The Midwife (December 26). The most enjoyable of the lot though, will be Adam Zwar\u2019s The Agony of Christmas, in which his astute and amusing agony aunts and uncles will muse on what is often the most awkward family gathering of the year. Big Bash cricket Ten, from December 20 It\u2019s too early to speculate whether cricket will be a panacea for Ten\u2019s interminable run of ratings ills. One challenge: it will be competing for attention against an already engrossing Ashes series. Having invested significantly in on-air talent, the network hopes it can use T20 to drive interest in their program slate. With Nine serving as cricket\u2019s free-to-air bastion for 37 years, there\u2019s plenty of interest in what Ten can come up with. Once Upon A Time In Punchbowl SBS One, from January 7 South-western Sydney\u2019s Lebanese community began arriving in large numbers four decades ago. The group has endured a tumultuous transition to Aussie life \u2013 facing festering prejudice around race and religion. Yes, the Cronulla riots are an ugly, indelible part of Sydney\u2019s history. A sequel of sorts to SBS\u2019s 2012 series on Cabramatta\u2019s Vietnamese community, this promising four-part docu-series delves into life inside a resilient community of Australians. True Detective/ Looking Showcase from January 13/January 20 Along with the previously mentioned new season of Girls, Foxtel\u2019s Showcase channel boasts two new series from HBO. Both premiere the same day in the US. The first, True Detective, is a police drama set in Louisiana that stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. It is hooked on the 17-year pursuit of a serial killer. The second, Looking, focuses on a group of gay men living in San Francisco. Orphan Black SBS2, from January 14 This fresh, edgy sci-fi drama has attracted plaudits as it aired around the world. A Canadian co-production with BBC America, it finally premieres locally this summer. Orphan Black is most notable for the star turn from its lead actress, Tatiana Maslany. In playing an array of different characters (no spoilers here), the 28-year-old Canadian veers between smoldering, perky and luminous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
