Who'd have thunk it? Not a lot of the people who scoff it, suggests Robert Kenner's glossy debrief on the role of big business in the US's food industry. Yucky clips of conveyor belts full of offal, and sheds of chickens wheezing their last as their internal organs are defeated by their weight gain are interspersed with case studies, waggishly narrated tours round the supermarket, and a mawkishly handled story about the avoidable death of a little boy who ate an E coli-tainted burger. It's an undeniably admirable project, but anyone who has read anything on the subject may feel they've feasted from this plate before. And there's something slightly uncomfortable about the authorship: no hectoring Michael Moore or gross-out Morgan Spurlock, but why are Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, on whose books this is based, seen as apparently objective interviewees?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
