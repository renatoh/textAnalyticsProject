In a 270-152 vote, the House of Representatives voted to approve construction of the contentious pipeline \u2013 a direct challenge to Obama who has said repeatedly he will veto the bill. The measure will be sent to the White House on Friday. Obama has 10 days after that to render his decision \u2013 but Republicans said they were braced for a veto. \u201cRight now he has indicated he is going to veto,\u201d John Hoeven, the Republican Senator from North Dakota who was the architect of the Keystone XL bill, said. He acknowledged that Republicans do not have the votes now to overcome a veto but said that the party leadership intended to attach Keystone measures on to other pieces of legislation. \u201cWe can attach it to other bills \u2013 energy, appropriations, the highway bill,\u201d he said. Twenty-nine Democrats voted with Republicans in favour of the bill, only one Republican, Justin Amash of Michigan, was opposed. The bill also contains an implicit endorsement that climate change is real and not a hoax \u2013 an important symbolic shift for Republicans. If Obama blocks the Keystone bill \u2013 as the White House has threatened repeatedly \u2013 it will be his third veto in his six years in the White House. The house bill is identical to that passed by the Senate last month which means that Republicans \u2013 a majority of whom deny the existence of climate change \u2013 were now accepting it as a reality. \u201cClimate change exists. You\u2019re saying that implicitly when you vote for the bill,\u201d Peter DeFazio, a Democratic congressman from Oregon, pointed out. However, the Senate bill acknowledging climate change is real and not a hoax does not say it is caused by human activity. The Senate voted down that proposal. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appealed to Obama to reverse the veto threat. However, the House speaker, John Boehner, cast conciliatory gestures aside, accusing Obama of siding with a leftwing fringe against the broader American interest. \u201cInstead of listening to the people, the president is standing with a bunch of left-fringe extremists and anarchists,\u201d Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThe president needs to listen to the American people and say: \u2018Yes, let\u2019s build a Keystone pipeline.\u2019\u201d Keystone XL, a project designed to transport crude from the tar sands of Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast, has morphed over the years into a broader fight about climate change. The bill before the House of Representatives was approved by the Senate late last month as the first order of business under Republican control. The pipeline is still undergoing administrative review, a process overseen by the State Department that is now in its seventh year. Obama has said repeatedly he would veto any measures seeking to short-circuit that process. However, an end may be in sight. Last week, the State Department received comments from eight different government agencies \u2013 including the EPA \u2013 on whether the project is in the national interest. The State Department has refused to make those reports public. But in a letter released last week, the EPA suggested the State Department revisit its assumptions that the Keystone XL pipeline would not worsen climate change in light of falling oil prices. The thinking behind the EPA review was that the cheap transport costs afforded by the pipeline \u2013 over tankers and oil trains \u2013 would make it easier for oil companies to operate in reduced profit margins of cheap oil. It\u2019s not known, however, how the EPA ruled on the broader question of the Keystone XL and the national interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
