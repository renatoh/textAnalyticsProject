Ladislav Niznansky was acquitted of carrying out 164 murders at the end of the second world war. He had been accused of being a member of the Nazis' notorious Edelweiss unit, which crushed a partisan uprising against Slovakia's Nazi puppet government. According to the prosecution, Niznansky took part in massacres in several Slovakian mountain villages. They included the killings of 146 people in Ostry Grun and Klak in January 1945, among them 48 women and 48 children, as well as the deaths of 18 Jewish civilians in nearby Ksinna. Yesterday, however, the chief judge Manfred G\u00f6tzl said that much of the evidence given at Mr Niznansky's 15-month trial was unreliable. Several witnesses had also withdrawn testimony originally given in 1962, when a court in communist Czechoslovakia sentenced him to death in absentia, he said. Justifying his verdict, the judge added: \"A judgment can't be based on this.\" Mr Niznansky said he was delighted. \"I expected it,\" he said after the ruling. \"I'm relieved after these two years of mental torture.\" His acquittal yesterday raises serious questions about the viability of bringing new war crimes prosecutions against suspects in their late 80s or 90s more than 60 years after their original crimes were allegedly committed. The case hinged on evidence from another former member of the unit, who at one point said he saw Mr Niznansky shoot 20 civilians. However, the witness repeatedly contradicted himself and appeared confused. Yesterday, however, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem urged the German government not to draw any \"false conclusions\" from the Niznansky case, pointing out that there are 663 fresh investigations against alleged war criminals going on in 11 countries. The hunt for local Nazi collaborators would continue, it said. \"It is true that the prosecution at this point of such criminals can be extremely difficult. But the horrific nature of their crimes makes it imperative to leave no stone unturned in the efforts to hold such murderers accountable for their crimes,\" the centre's chief Nazi-hunter, Ephraim Zuroff, told the Guardian. He added: \"While unfortunate, today's acquittal should in no way lessen the determination to bring as many as possible killers of the Holocaust to justice.\" The prosecution had demanded life imprisonment. They would now appeal, they said. A former Slovak army captain, Mr Niznansky at first supported the uprising in 1944. He changed sides, however, after the Nazis captured him. He then commanded the Slovak section of the Edelweiss unit, which hunted down partisans and carried out brutal reprisals against villagers who supported them, burning down their homes and shooting civilians. In the most infamous incident, the unit captured US and British officers, who had parachuted into Nazi-controlled Slovakia, including Joseph Morton, a war correspondent for the Associated Press news agency. The entire group was executed in the Nazi concentration camp at Mauthausen, Austria, in January 1945. Morton was the only war correspondent to be executed during the war. Mr Niznansky did not deny being a member of the unit - but said that refusal would have meant being sent to a concentration camp. He always insisted that others ordered and carried out the killings. He told the court that he regretted the deaths. Born in Czechoslovakia, Mr Niznansky is thought to have escaped to West Germany in 1948. For 33 years he lived openly with his wife in a Munich suburb, and he worked for decades at the US-government backed Radio Free Europe, which broadcast into the then communist-controlled Czechoslovakia. In 1996, he became a German citizen. In 2001 German authorities began a reluctant investigation into the case following a request from the Slovak authorities. Judges then travelled to Slovakia to interview surviving witnesses. But they concluded there was enough evidence to prosecute. In January 2004 German police arrested Mr Niznansky. In October 2004 the court released him from custody, however, citing contradictory testimony from a witness whose evidence helped secure his conviction in 1962. Mr Niznansky had dismissed the first verdict against him as the product of a \"communist show trial\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
