First, I was seconded to be project manager of Holocaust Memorial Day UK, developing a programme of events to commemorate the Holocaust for Edinburgh City Council. The theme was kids in the Holocaust. For me it meant quite a high level of responsibility because it was a national rather than a local project and a huge creative challenge because it's a topic that is quite horrific. So many questions were raised before we even got going. How do you do something like that without putting kids off? How do we engage young people in discussion and debate about what happened when there is the potential for war just now? What lessons can we learn from what happened in Europe 60 years ago that are relevant today? Also, when there are kids in all the schools from ethnic minority backgrounds, how do we get all the kids - and the parents and teaching staff - to think about that? I had some background in drama and we did two pieces of theatre, one of which was based on the life of Ernest Levy, a Glasgow survivor of the camps who has done a vast amount of educational work based on his experience. We also held workshops and took 22 fifth- and sixth-year kids to visit Auschwitz. In straight teaching about the Holocaust it's easy to get lost in numbers but when you put an individual face and age to the children who were there ... I hope the experience will have a lasting impact on everyone who was there. It will on me. Now I'm back to community education, coordinating Go4it and Play4it, projects which provide holiday activities for 8-18 year olds all over the city. The idea is to provide quality at low cost. I've also been promoting community education for kids with disabilities and special needs and that's been one of the key successes of the last year. The challenge has been working out how we work with other organisations to bring the best out of everyone. Some councils are cutting services. In Edinburgh there's enthusiasm for backing what we're doing. It's a nice position to be in, getting the political backing. I have no intention of leaving the public sector. It's not always about the money. In my job I get a lot of flexibility - I've had three very different projects this year that have all taught me something. I'm learning all the time and work with some fantastic people. I've been so inspired by people I've met through the Holocaust project. And it's incredibly satisfying to work with young people who can take something out of what you're doing. I'm dead happy. Public voices: March 21 2002 Youth worker, community education, Edinburgh Salary: \u00a326,000 Since last year I've moved into two new areas but am still in the same field of work. One is a project with kids with problems at school and the second is a project to keep kids occupied during the holidays and try and provide activities. In many ways it has been a great year. Our big project last year, which commemorated the Holocaust, was awarded the Standard Life Education Awards for the region and that felt good. It was a special award from the Director of Education for outstanding achievement. He was at the show. It was a recognition for all the work that had gone into it. I was then asked to work as one of the coordinators of a project for kids with problems in school and that has been pretty challenging and also it has given me new kinds of management experience. I was working as a senior youth worker. I was asked to go to work on it, which was good. The second project for keeping kids busy during the holiday can mean everything from organising rock concerts, to working with music. It was a big success last year with the police reporting that in some areas holiday crime had fallen by 40%. Go Four It - the name of the holiday project - is interesting because it is an initiative from Edinburgh city councillors and it has proper funding behind it. For a lot of the last 10 years I've spent my time raising money for projects but this is different - the council have put the hard cash behind the idea. I think it demonstrates a political commitment at the council level but one that is also coming from the Scottish Executive and I'm pretty happy about that. Money wise, I suppose I still earn a lot less than I would in the private sector but that never has been a big issue for me. It's still about job satisfaction. Financially, I'm earning a couple of grand more since I've got a more managerial position. I suppose I'd say the conditions we are working in now are pretty damned good. Money for community work like this is now on the political agenda. On a material level I'd say the working environment has improved. The money is there. It doesn't affect how valued I feel or don't feel. I've always felt valued in this kind of work because of the feedback you get from the kids. But now that the funding is there, I have more time for face to face work rather than fundraising. I've no plans to leave the public service. Why would I? Maggie O'Kane The Common Good: March 21 2001 Youth worker, community education, Edinburgh Salary: \u00a323,500 I come from Port Glasgow. It's a shipbuilding town that no longer builds ships. I worked for five years in the shipyards from 16. In my early 20s I went to night school to do my highers. I was motivated to do it - I really enjoyed doing it. It stuck in my mind, doing Macbeth, thinking this is brilliant. I knew I wanted to work with young people. I went to St Martin's College in Lancaster to do a three-year degree in Community Studies and Youth Work. After college I worked as an outreach worker in Brighton Housing Trust. I suppose I earned about \u00a314,000 then. You'd see up to 150 people a day coming in the door. There was street work, wandering the streets and finding the people for the soup kitchens. There was a lot of hopelessness, a lot of stress in seeing people on a daily basis with huge difficulties in their lives. That's the thing about homelessness, it can get anybody. The number of people I met who had their own businesses, successful jobs, families, then things split. He hit the bottle, lost the business, lost the kids and hit the streets. People whose whole lives fell apart. Young folk dying of drug overdoses, people that you knew. I didn't think much about the wages. I loved the work. Getting the satisfaction of seeing people coming out the other side and making it. Maybe I was taking home around \u00a3500 a month then. We were skint. Up to our ears in overdrafts. We went back to Edinburgh and I got a job in Craigmillar. It's an area that had problems - lots of high unemployment. It used to have seven breweries , a mine, a brick factory. It was built in the 1930s as a vision of the future for overcrowded housing from the city slums of Edinburgh. Now the breweries are all closed and the mine is gone . I'm worried about portraying it in a negative way, it receives enough bad press. I suppose it is home to decent ordinary people trying to bring up a family as best they can. I've spent 10 years of my life working there and I've loved it. My job is about people as individuals, realising their full potential. I was looking at ways to do that in Craigmillar. There was no money for doing the job, no funding. I had to be fundraiser as well. I did theatre, dance, music and I've taken young people from here all over the world. What I've been really really good at in my job is bringing in resources. I say if you want to do it, do it. I believe in raising young people's aspirations. Saying, get out of Craigmillar for a start. Go and see other places in the world. Craigmillar will always be here for you, you can always come back. Get outside of Edinburgh, get outside of Scotland. The first trip away was to take a group to Cyprus for an outdoor week. I had a mate who was a worker in the RAF base. The group worked together for a year to raise the money. Fundraising, doing letter writing - for them it is learning communication skills - writing to funders, teaching them presentation skills, all things that can be transferable. The next year I heard the Ocean Youth Club were planning a trip around the Caribbean. I had a week to come up with the deposit. We started phoning around and I said we want to take a group from Craigmillar. I don't just want to take one or two young people I want to take 10 young people, we want to take over a boat. We put a preparation programme together. It was quite intense for fundraising, first aid training, a lot of stuff - personal and professional development that big companies spend thousands on for management schemes to do this. We raised \u00a320,000. It came from local businesses who were incredibly generous, from cake sales and that kind of stuff. I asked a local councillor to help us out and he said great, what chance do kids from Craigmillar get to do something like that? They have as much right to see the world as Prince William on Operation Raleigh. It can take us up to two years to come up with the money for a project like this, but that's part of the training. One kid can go to their Dad and say I need \u00a3400 to go skiing and he gets it. I'm not knocking that or saying that it's a bad thing in it self, but for our kids part of the whole project is the effort and discipline they have to put into raising money themselves. It is a commitment they have to make for a year at least to the project and to each other. It's about presentation, writing to companies, presenting their cases, sending thank-you letters - all that stuff. Young people with middle class backgrounds take gap years all the time. In places like Craigmillar they don't take gap years. If you are in a gap it means you are on the dole. For me, money should not be a barrier for young people having the opportunity to do that. Again, I have always said money is not a problem. But I say to the group, 'You're not getting this for nothing. You have to work you have to earn your place on it. You have to finance some of it yourself, but that doesn't mean you ask your folks for the money when they don't have it. You have to get off your arse and earn it.' It was hard work that sea trip. It's not just a jolly. You're living, 18 of you, in a very close environment under intense heat and they are being vio lently seasick. It's hard going if you're 16 and you're never been used to that. But it was fantastic. It was a huge adventure. And if you didn't learn something about yourself, and you don't want to do something with your life, well, that's up to you. This is a whole personal development programme, trying to give them the best quality of programme you can come up with. When I worked in the shipyards there were guys who came in on a Monday morning and said, 'I hate this place'. They had been doing it for 20 years. I didn't want a life like that. I've brought in about \u00a3160,000 worth of grants in the years I've been here. I wanted to take the kids on trips that really challenge them or in the theatre work, get professionals in for them. I want a professional scriptwriter to bring out the best in them. I'm saying to them, 'You are worth the best. Give your best'. I've got a quote from Kurt Hahn on my wall from the founder of Outward Bound: 'We are all better than we know.' If only we can be brought to realise this then we will never again settle for anything less. I want them to achieve their best. My job is quite unique because I get a buzz doing it. I think I get paid well for my job - I'm at the top of my scale, about \u00a323,500. I'd like to have more, I'd like to be wealthy, but I'm not. The wealth is in the job satisfaction. That's worth several thousand pounds for me. I love it to see young people developing, growing in confidence and standing up. That is worth huge amounts of money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
