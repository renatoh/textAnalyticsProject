The report by PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that London could benefit by a \u00a35.9bn rise in gross domestic product from staging the Games, but warned that unless action was taken the rest of the country could suffer a severe economic drain. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: \"The challenge is to try to ensure that the whole of the UK benefits from the Olympics - that is very important. While London has been chosen and is going to see a major benefit, there would be great concern if other parts of the UK failed to see any benefit and lost out as a result. It is something the committee would want to keep a close eye on.\" Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary and Olympics minister, insisted that the negative impact on the regions would only take place if the government adopted a \"do nothing\" strategy. The Olympic Games impact study, commissioned by her department and the London Development Agency, predicts that staging the Olympics could benefit the overall economy by \u00a31.9bn by 2016. But Jowell predicted \"we can do much better than that\" and outlined steps that the government was taking to ensure the regions did not suffer, including a nations and regions advisory group, a summit next June of business leaders from outside London and a 2012 tourism charter. \"The report takes at its starting point what would happen if the government and 2012 stakeholders sat on the sidelines and did nothing to spread the benefits from the games,\" she said. \"That's a really useful place to begin - much better than making unrealistic claims from the outset and becoming complacent . . . This early action is the key to unlocking real benefits for the whole country.\" Hugh Robertson, the shadow Olympics minister, said it was time for the government to take the hype out of its predictions, and that the priorities were to fund medal-winning athletes to the tune of \u00a345m each year and ensure a lasting legacy in encouraging mass participation in sport. \"We have got to be more realistic about what we can and cannot expect from the games - they will give a kick to the London economy and not such a great kick outside London,\" he said. Peter Mearns, director of marketing at the Northwest Regional Development Agency, said: \"The report is based on a do-nothing scenario, which is not the situation we are in. The agency is committed to a proactive approach and will build on the strengths of the region to ensure that the north-west is well placed to benefit from the games.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
