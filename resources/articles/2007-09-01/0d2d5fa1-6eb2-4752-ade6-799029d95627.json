The Football Association, waiting on the referee Howard Webb's match report, will consider whether to charge Jose Mourinho for his post-match protestations as he queried just why a perfectly valid goal from Salomon Kalou had been ruled out for offside. Yet, privately, the Portuguese may have more familiar concerns playing on his mind. The scrubbing of Kalou's reward when he was quite clearly behind the full-back Juliano Belletti as the Brazilian's cross fizzed into the six-yard box actually exposed the deficiencies that continue to eat away at Andriy Shevchenko. This was a first Chelsea appearance of the season for the Ukrainian, previously frustrated by back problems for his club if not his country, and it had been billed effectively as a trial for the 30-year-old to prove he belonged. Had he taken the few chances that fell to him, the disallowed goal would have mattered little. Instead, dwarfed by Christopher Samba and the colossal Ryan Nelsen, he cut a bewildered figure. Brad Friedel denied him his clearest opening, a close-range header blocked with his legs, though it said much that the cleanest contact Shevchenko made all afternoon was with Samba's skull from the rebound. The Congolese defender's head spun round on impact and he departed on a stretcher, only regaining consciousness in an ambulance en route to hospital. Thankfully he was later deemed fit enough to make the return flight to Lancashire, though in truth it is Shevchenko's club career which needs resuscitation. Another opportunity had been wrecked by a heavy first touch, a ballooned header over the bar having set a troubled tone. Chelsea, without Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard, have now failed to score in their last two league games. \"We have lost important points,\" conceded Mourinho. \"I knew the beginning of the season would be difficult because we played away against two candidates, Liverpool and Manchester United. We have a very difficult start compared to the other teams in contention who play almost every team from the bottom of the league.\" The manager cheekily insisted his team had, in fact, scored through Kalou, and he vented his frustration at the referee and his assistant, Peter Kirkup, at the final whistle. His foray on to the turf to remonstrate as the players retreated to the dressing rooms could now prompt a charge. The FA is understood to be prepared to ignore his initial tantrum on the touchline - he flung down a monitor after attempting to show the fourth official a replay of the incident - but will act if Webb reports the confrontation at the end. The referees' chief, Keith Hackett, will also conduct an inquiry as to why Kalou was denied; after scrutinising reruns he, Webb and Kirkup privately concede that the decision was wrong. \"This was a decision so clear, so pure, so clean, it is like water,\" said Mourinho. Similar bafflement greeted the award to Chelsea of a penalty at Anfield last month. On that occasion Hackett telephoned the Liverpool manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, to apologise. Mourinho indicated that his phone would not be on to receive a similar admission. With Shevchenko peripheral and Michael Essien denied thrillingly by Friedel, only exasperation remained. There is an admirable stubbornness to Mark Hughes's side and this was a 15th game in all competitions without defeat. Robbie Savage's shot, turned over by Petr Cech, might have condemned Chelsea to a first home league defeat in 66 matches. There was plenty to appreciate in Rovers' performance, not least the work ethic through the team's spine, even if the primary concern was for Samba's health. \"It was an accident, and Christopher has shown great defensive quality just to put his head in that situation,\" said Hughes. \"Probably Shevchenko wasn't aware that he was prepared to do that.\" Lost amid the helter-skelter, the Ukrainian is running out of excuses.
