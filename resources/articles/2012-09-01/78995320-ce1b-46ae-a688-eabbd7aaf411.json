There's some way to go on that, but there's still some enticing new and upcoming stuff here, like a taster of next year's Stone Roses-centric road comedy Spike Island. There are previews of new indies Girl Shaped Love Drug (a Manchester love story) and Day Of The Flowers (Eva Birthistle and dancer Carlos Acosta hit it off in Cuba). Plus film-makers present recent hits, such as Eran Creevy with last year's Shifty. Odeon Printworks, Fri to 7 Oct The Big Screen, London &amp; Bristol Possibly the most revered and comprehensively knowledgable film writer on the planet, David Thomson has always had the big picture in mind when it comes to the pictures, as evidenced by his authoritative Biographical Dictionary Of Film, or his earlier book The Whole Equation. This time he goes even bigger. The Big Screen (subtitled: The Story Of The Movies And What They Did To Us) is a typically eloquent and ambivalent study of art, life, how movies have taught us how to live and how they've stopped us having a life. He'll doubtless put it more eloquently than that at these special appearances. At the Watershed, Thomson also selects a few of his favourite films for this month's Sunday brunches, including Kiss Me Deadly and Blue Velvet. BFI Southbank, SE1, Tue; Watershed, Bristol, Wed; Barbican, EC2, Thu; London Review Bookshop, WC1, Fri Jameson Cult Film Club, Manchester Taking a leaf out of the Secret Cinema playbook, these events provide enhanced settings for classic movies \u2013 except for free, thanks to the whiskey firm's sponsorship. This time it's James Cameron's original Terminator, and the appropriately raw, industrial spaces of Manchester's Victoria Warehouse lend themselves to transformation into the movie's 80s-tastic TechNoir nightclub. Expect smoke, neon lights, feather perms, multiple Sarah Connors, and \u2013 possibly \u2013 a giant, naked Teutonic robot bodybuilder. After the screening there's an appropriately 80s \"techno rave\" with \"a famous Manchester DJ\" (ideally not Bez). Victoria Warehouse, Thu Bicycle Film Festival, London Cycling surely hasn't been this popular in Britain since pre-internal combustion engine days. We live in a post-Olympics/Tour de France world where Bradley Wiggins and Laura Trott are household names and the bike-centric thriller Premium Rush is in cinemas. So now you know your keirin from your peloton, discover a world of danger freaks, madcap inventors and cycle-centric artists. While New York Trinidadians create cycle-based soundsystems in Made In Queens, Toronto's Backwards Rider does just that, and Ghana's Bikelordz take BMX style to a new level. Alongside the mainstream sports, sample women's BMX, ice biking, and retro Italian road racing. The Dardennes' touching The Kid With A Bike caters to loftier tastes, or for the real-life Premium Rush, check out Line Of Sight, a headcam tour of traffic-dodging courier races around various cities.
