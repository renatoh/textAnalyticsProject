Fu took \u00a375,000 a runner-up. \"This is the biggest tournament I've won,\" said Ding, who in 2007 left Wembley in some distress, not because he had lost 10-3 to Ronnie O'Sullivan but because of hearing some unpleasant remarks while he was sitting in his chair. Indeed, but for some kindly words from O'Sullivan backstage at 9-3, he would not have returned to the arena for a further frame. Fu's defeat of Ding for the gold medal in last month's Asian Games enhanced his status as a Hong Kong national hero. He was relishing another \"Chinese derby\", as he put it, as was Ding, who said: \"Two Chinese players in the final will be big news in my country.\" A live television audience of 100 million Chinese viewers was anticipated for the evening session, although coverage of China v Uzbekistan in football's Asian Cup was preferred in the afternoon when Ding was quickly 2-0 up through breaks of 120 and 74. Fu's first pots of the afternoon amounted to 80 and he looked like stealing the fourth from 0-62 until he left the brown, the only ball Ding needed, hanging over a pocket. After Ding had increased his lead to 4-1 with a brown-to-black clearance, Fu rallied with 82 in the sixth only to wilt in the remaining two frames, which Ding efficiently clinched with 60 and 66 respectively. Fu looked slightly jaded, perhaps a delayed legacy of his 6-4 semi-final win over the fast-rising Northern Ireland left-hander Mark Allen from 4-1 down, a recovery he launched with a magnificent trio of breaks, 130, 97 and 136. Nevertheless, he came out fresh for the evening session, quickly reducing his arrears to 6-4 and leaving Ding needing a snooker in the next with only pink and black remaining. Memories of notable Masters comebacks began to stir: the late Paul Hunter prevailing 10-9 from 7-3 down to Fergal O'Brien in 2001 and 7-2 to O'Sullivan in 2004, Steve Davis beating O'Sullivan 10-8 from 8-4 adrift in 1997 and, pre-eminently, Stephen Hendry beating Mike Hallett 9-8 in 1991 from 0-7 and 2-8. However, as Stephen Fry, an avid snooker watcher, tweeted, Ding laid as fine a snooker as one is likely to see and potted pink and black for 7-4 from Fu's failed escape. \"Most important that frame,\" said Ding succinctly. With Fu's resistance neutered, the 23-year-old Chinese flew past the post in style with breaks of 94, 83 and 85 to add the game's most prestigious invitation tournament title to his four ranking event triumphs. \"Ding's a great player,\" said Fu. \"I think it's only a matter of time before he wins the world championship.\" Snooker was unknown in China before a pioneering visit by Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor 25 years ago but it now has more players than the rest of the world put together with the largest of its innumerable clubs having anything up to 100 tables. \"We had 5000 tables in the 80s,\" said Fu. \"We only have 700 now but that's still not bad for our size.\" Ding, has been the standard bearer for the Chinese snooker revolution since he won both the Asian and world under-21 titles at the age of 15. He has sometimes found the burden of the national expectation hard to bear but has won four ranking titles and is one of the seven twentysomethings in the current top 16 whom the three most prolific title winners of the 21st century, John Higgins, O'Sullivan and Mark Williams \u2013 who are all past their 35th birthday \u2013 are trying to keep at bay as they attempt to make the most of their remaining prime years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
