Climate experts who spoke to Guardian Australia said they were \u201cbewildered\u201d the emergency had grabbed little attention during the final parliamentary sitting week for the year, which was instead taken up by the repeal of medevac laws, a restructure of the public service, and energy minister Angus Taylor\u2019s run-in with the American author Naomi Wolf. Escalating conditions on Thursday and Friday led to dozens of out-of-control bushfires, including in the NSW\u2019s Hawkesbury region, where a fire at Gospers Mountain merged with two other blazes burning in the lower Hunter on Friday. Sydney has been blanketed with a thick smoke haze that health officials said had led to a 25% increase in people presenting in emergency departments for asthma and breathing problems. Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist with the University of NSW\u2019s Climate Change Research Centre, said she was \u201csurprised, bewildered, concerned\u201d that the emergency had prompted little discussion from political leaders this week. \u201cHere we are in the worst bushfire season we\u2019ve ever seen, the biggest drought we\u2019ve ever had, Sydney surrounded by smoke, and we\u2019ve not heard boo out of a politician addressing climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cThey dismissed it from the outset and haven\u2019t come back to it since. \u201cThey\u2019re burying their heads in the sand while the world is literally burning around them and that\u2019s the scary thing. It\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d Mark Howden, the director of the Australian National University\u2019s Climate Change Institute and a vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said while the fires were raging on, \u201cthe commentary in terms of climate change has very much died down\u201d. \u201cYesterday they did a public service reshuffle, or there was medevac, or the \u2018union-busting\u2019 bill,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government chooses the points they want to discuss in the parliament and the fact they haven\u2019t chosen to discuss it sends a message to me. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a question of priorities, that\u2019s how I interpret it.\u201d Howden said the general public had already joined the dots about the rising number of extreme weather days that brought heat, wind and dry conditions and high fire danger. He said all of the indicators of fire danger were starting to change and the effects of this were evident through increased frequency of fires, larger fire areas, more severe fires, fires burning in ecosystems not prone to fire and a longer fire season. Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the extent and severity of the current fires meant that ecosystems that shouldn\u2019t be burning \u2013 such as rainforests in NSW \u2013 were on fire. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of failure to act on climate change, which is hurting people\u2019s lives as well as nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be increased attention on the impact of climate change and it\u2019s relationship with fire and how that threatens humans as well as nature and the environment.\u201d Martin Rice, the head of research at the Climate Council, said the devastating fire conditions predicted by emergency leaders this year when they requested a meeting with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, were unfolding. He said Morrison had still failed to meet with emergency leaders, however both Taylor and the emergency services minister David Littleproud have now done so. Rice said the government was \u201cfailing to respond\u201d to the climate crisis and to the \u201chealth emergency\u201d created by toxic air around greater Sydney. \u201cThis has to be a wake-up call to the federal government,\u201d he said. Rice said the Reserve Bank, medical practitioners, councils and mayors, emergency leaders and students were just some of the people who had made recent public pleas for a response. \u201cAll walks of life in Australia are demanding action,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
