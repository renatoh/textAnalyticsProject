But if it's pretty pubs and ale you're after, head past the church and freewheel your way over centuries-old Bath Bridge. Coasting along with the smell of fresh-cut grass wafting over from the nearby paddock, you duck off left a mile or so later towards Shipton Moyne. Along the way you cross an old humpbacked bridge, the babbling brook below it a tributary of the River Avon. Shortly after, you're arriving in the blink-and-you'll-miss-it village of Shipton Moyne, where traffic amounts to nothing more than the occasional tractor. It's also home to the strangely named Cat and Custard Pot pub, which is ideally placed for your first refreshment stop. The ale of choice in these parts is Wadworth 6X \u2013 brewed just down the road in Trowbridge \u2013 and on a sunny day you can sit on the wall outside and watch horses from the nearby stables clip-clop past. Suitably refreshed, you pootle down the street past Cotswold-stone cottages covered with climbing roses, and on into a narrow lane. Its bordering hedgerows are so high you could be travelling through a leafy tunnel; birds flit about noisily within, occasionally bursting from the bushes with a frantic flutter of wings. Easton Grey awaits you, a few miles further \u2013 one of the many villages around here that time forgot. A downhill stretch now leads you to a cluster of old cottages huddled around a humpbacked bridge. Leaving the village and heading along a lane towards Sherston, you'll see the scenery open out to reveal gorgeous green fields on either side as you pedal towards lunch \u2013 just one short ascent between you and a plate of Malmesbury Gold pork sausages and spring-onion mash at the 16th-century Rattlebone Inn. The wonky walls, nooks, and crannies give this place a cosy feel. Head back out of Sherston into quiet country lanes that thread their way between meadows to the National Arboretum at Westonbirt. In spring it's awash with pink, white, and purple blossoms. The Hare and Hounds Hotel isn't far now, and it serves the best lemon drizzle cake in the world (fact). Take a seat in the garden and order a large slice to energise yourself for the three miles (including some fun downhills) back to Tetbury, where yet more delicious local food and drink await at the Priory Inn. Stop and see en route Westonbirt Arboretum (01666 880220, forestry.gov.uk/westonbirt) This place is home to one of the biggest collections of trees in the world. In spring the famous rhododendrons burst into bloom, scenting the air with their perfume. Hookshouse Pottery (01666 880297, hookshousepottery.co.uk) Ask owner Chris White to show you round (if you're lucky, he might even demonstrate how to throw a pot). If you've got time, check out the garden. Off route Tetbury's antique shops There are about 25 to explore. Whether you're after old books, maps, or garden furniture, you can rummage to your heart's content before wandering around this gorgeous medieval town. Blue Zucchini Brasserie (7\u20139 Church Street, Tetbury, 01666 505852) Follow the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, pull up a chair, and order a slab of caramel shortbread. Where to stay and eat The Priory Inn (01666 502251, theprioryinn.co.uk, doubles from \u00a3109 B&amp;B) Delicious local food, local beers (including Pig's Ear and Banker's Draft), and well-kept comfy rooms.
