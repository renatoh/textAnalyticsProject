Detectives have completed identification of the bodies found in the container, which was shipped from Belgium to Essex on 23 October, and confirmed that all the victims, 31 males and eight females, were Vietnamese. As well as the two children aged 15, Dinh Dinh Binh and Nguyen Huy Hung, there was one 17-year-old, four 18-year-olds and three 19-year-olds. A team of Vietnamese officials traveled to Britain to help with the formal identification. Assistant chief constable Tim Smith, who is leading the inquiry, said: \u201cThis was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores. \u201cOur priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims\u2019 friends and families. It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual\u2019s next of kin were informed, and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one\u2019s identity.\u201d Caroline Beasley-Murray, senior coroner in Essex, offered her condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cMy thoughts are with them at this unimaginably difficult time.\u201d Police confirmed that Pham Thi Tra My, the 26-year-old who sent text messages to her family to tell them she was dying, was among the dead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Pham wrote from the lorry. The oldest victim was 44. Most came from three known people-smuggling areas in Vietnam: Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Quang Binh. Ha Tinh province was the site of a chemical spill from a steel factory in 2016 that poisoned up to 125 miles of the northern coastline and devastated the fishing industry. Many people have left the area in search of work abroad. The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, 25, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Eight suspects were arrested in Vietnam this week in relation to people smuggling offences. Katherine Mulhern, the head of the anti-trafficking charity, Ecpat UK, said: \u201cThis tragedy has shocked the UK and its impact has been felt by people across the country who arrived in the UK in the back of lorries. Many of the young people we come into contact with are dealing with significant trauma triggered by this tragedy.\u201d She said it must serve as \u201ca wake-up call to governments of the devastating human cost of the policies driving these dangerous journeys\u201d. Mimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of young Vietnamese people to Europe and the UK, said: \u201cIt is revealing the sheer number of young people, the 10 teenagers, who died. Children and teenagers have an exacerbated vulnerability, they are under the thumb of the trafficking network that is controlling them.\u201d The full list of victims\u2019 names, released by Essex police: Pham Thi Tra My, 26, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Huy Phong, 35, from Ha Tinh Vo Nhan Du, 19, from Ha Tinh Tran Manh Hung, 37, from Ha Tinh Tran Khanh Tho, 18, from Ha Tinh Vo Van Linh, 25, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Van Nhan, 33, from Ha Tinh Bui Phan Thang, 37, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Huy Hung, 15, from Ha Tinh Tran Thi Tho, 21, from Nghe An Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Nghe An Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, from Nghe An Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, from Nghe An Le Van Ha, 30, from Nghe An Tran Thi Ngoc, 19, from Nghe An Nguyen Van Hung, 33, from Nghe An Hoang Van Tiep, 18, from Nghe An Cao Tien Dung, 37, from Nghe An Cao Huy Thanh, 33, from Nghe An Tran Thi Mai Nhung, 18, from Nghe An Nguyen Minh Quang, 20, from Nghe An Le Trong Thanh, 44, from Dien Chau Pham Thi Ngoc Oanh, 28, from Nghe An Hoang Van Hoi, 24, from Nghe An Nguyen Tho Tuan, 25, from Nghe An Dang Huu Tuyen, 22, from Nghe An Nguyen Trong Thai, 26, from Nghe An Nguyen Van Hiep, 24, from Nghe An Nguyen Thi Van, 35, from Nghe An Tran Hai Loc, 35, from Nghe An Duong Minh Tuan, 27, from Quang Binh Nguyen Ngoc Ha, 32, from Quang Binh Nguyen Tien Dung, 33, from Quang, Binh Phan Thi Thanh, 41, from Hai Phong Nguyen Ba Vu Hung, 34, from Thua Tien Hue Dinh Dinh Thai Quyen, 18, from Hai Phong Tran Ngoc Hieu, 17, from Hai Duong Dinh Dinh Binh, 15, from Hai Phong"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
