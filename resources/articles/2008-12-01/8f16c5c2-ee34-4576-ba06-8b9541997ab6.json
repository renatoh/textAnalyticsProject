I've just been playing with a new one called Twitter Venn, which lets you display searches as Venn diagrams. Basically, you type in two or search terms -- such as iPhone, Android and BlackBerry -- and view the result. I'm not sure if I've learned anything from Twitter Venn, but I'd certainly be interested in trying Google Venn. Twitter Venn was written in Java by Canadian programmer Jeff Clark, who has created lots of interesting visualisations at Neoformix, including word portraits and StreamGraphs. His \"about\" says: \"I enjoy discovering the patterns in the apparent chaos of real life data and exploring new techniques for communicating what I discover in a visually compelling manner.\" Jeff's other projects include Twitter StreamGraphs, Twitter Arcs, Digg Trends, and Digg Explorer. One Christmassy thing to try is the Text Snowflake Creator, which creates very simple snowflake-style graphics for words you type in. You can see the snowflake grow as you type words in, then change various things including the type font, word spacing and background colour. (I can't see a way to save images: I used a screen grabber.) You could use Text Snowflake Creator to create a last-minute card for someone special."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
