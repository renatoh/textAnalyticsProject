Is it psychedelic? If it\u2019s an exploratory approach to music then perhaps we are. If it\u2019s about creating huge walls of glistening, phased-out guitars then we are not. I\u2019ve always felt more like a garage band than anything. We don\u2019t write songs about space, either.\u201d For a moment there, it felt as though the psych-soul-surf-fuzz-garage-space rock-jazz-DIY-shamans King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard had slowed down on their deranged release schedule \u2013 nothing for eight whole months. \u201cDid we?\u201d laughs singer Mackenzie. Yes. \u201cMaybe,\u201d the emperor Gizzard replies. \u201cMaybe, not sure. We finished off Quarters! in October so it feels like we kept busy.\u201d But it didn\u2019t come out till May! Where could we turn to for our wigged-out Aus psych? Both Pond and Tame Impala were offering us moments of mind-melting musical metamorphosis, but even so \u2026 eight months? \u201cI wanted to make a record where I didn\u2019t have to yell,\u201d says Mackenzie, \u201cas well as exploring some longer, repetitive song structures.\u201d Four tracks, four quarters, each one precisely 10.10 minutes long, each one an extended jam teeming with melodies, the occasional trickle of water, space funk, laughter like Pink Floyd and deliciously unfussy grooves. \u201cI also didn\u2019t want to use any brutal guitar pedals or sing through blown-out guitar amps as I usually would.\u201d As noted, King Gizzard\u2019s music (sometimes) sounds so simple you can almost hear the workings. \u201cIt is jam-based and has minimal overdubbed parts,\u201d finishes the singer, adding that the record was more of an experiment than anything. One time I took acid, and all the hairs on my arm lit up like Sunderland bridge, and time started folding in on itself backwards. This is almost exactly what the final track on Quarters! \u2013 the gentle, trippy, playful Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer \u2013 sounds like. Except it doesn\u2019t. Of course. \u201cMusic is exploratory for me,\u201d says Mackenzie, whose dad would sing him to sleep with Neil Young and Paul Kelly songs. He later graduated to 1960s psych garage compilations such as Pebbles and Nuggets, and on to \u201cweirder, 1970s eastern stuff\u201d like Erkin Koray and Flower Travellin\u2019 Band. \u201cI feel like there are a million ways to make music or make a record that I haven\u2019t explored yet. Not to mention so many instruments to learn, music to hear, cultures to explore.\u201d For a band that started as a side project in 2011, the Wizards have been astonishingly fertile since. \u201cWe were friends before King Gizzard originated playing in a jumble of other bands around Melbourne,\u201d says Mackenzie. \u201cSometimes I wish we had started a taxi service \u2013 could have gotten in there before Uber.\u201d Instead they have released six albums and a range of 12-inchers on multi-coloured wax. Standouts include the disturbing Satan Speeds Up, the cuddly psychosis of Hot Wax, and the one that made the rock world stir out of its torpor for three seconds: the mighty, mighty 16-minute-long Head On/Pill, blast after blast after blast of pre-emptive guitar lines and fuzzy bliss. \u201cLanguage to me is music and there is a lot of rhythm and melody in the way people talk. Music and lyrics are one and the same. I\u2019m not sure where the lyrics come from but, for me, it is surely the same part of the brain as the music.\u201d There are videos extolling the virtues of Vegemite (\u201cIt\u2019s delicious!\u201d) in the same way the Flaming Lips once extolled the virtues of Vaseline. The parallels don\u2019t stop there. Like the Lips years before Coyne started rolling around in giant hamster balls, King Gizzard are on a dizzying trip to the centre of psychedelia (Arthur Brown, Syd Barrett, The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, Gong), cocooning themselves in spaced-out neighing, decaying, vertiginous guitar lines and engorged melodies that demand to beviewed, Disney-style, through a dodecahedral prism of light. In other places, their music is bubblegum pop. Bubblegum like Archie on acid. It seems like only a year ago that this unpredictable seven-piece were giving away all their music for free because it felt like a \u201cfuturistic thing to do\u201d. Oh wait, it was only a year ago. \u201cWe don\u2019t make any money off digital sales anyway,\u201d says Mackenzie. \u201cWho does? So why not give it to them for free?\u201d Since then King Gizzard have been touring the world \u2013 the US, Australia, their coming appearance at Glastonbury \u2013 in a haze of oil-streaked light shows, strobes and psychedelic dressage. \u201cOutdoor shows scare me,\u201d confesses their singer. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt a lot more at home playing under a roof with the sound bouncing around the room.\u201d Which explains \u201cthe dawn of Gizzfest\u201d, the band\u2019s two-day pysch jam on their home turf, where like-minded bands crowd together to blow minds. It smacks of a scene. \u201cThere are bands we play with regularly who play a similar style of music,\u201d acknowledges Mackenzie. \u201cI\u2019m usually the most influenced by the music my friends\u2019 bands are making. Does that make a scene? There sure is some fantastic and inspiring music coming from Australia all the time, and that is the most important thing.\u201d As to how they manage to get through so many live shows, what fuels the madness? \u201cFor half the band, it\u2019s kale and quinoa. For the other it\u2019s Red Bull and Twisties.\u201d Everything is light and colour and sound in King Gizzard\u2019s world. \u2022 King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are touring North America and Europe, playing Glastonbury festival on 26 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
