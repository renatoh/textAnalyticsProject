The Dutchman, who was unveiled as Frank Lampard\u2019s successor as manager on Friday, acknowledged that relationships with elite clubs could prove pivotal if Derby are to achieve his target of a top-six finish in his first season in England. Cocu, who has a four-year contract, declined to discuss individual targets but said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d for the club to re-sign Fikayo Tomori or Harry Wilson, though Derby are understood to have made their admiration for the latter clear to Liverpool should the Welshman be made available for loan. Mason Mount, who also spent last season at Derby, is set to be involved under Lampard at Chelsea. \u201cIf you look at the value of those players, they were very important last season,\u201d said Cocu, who has signed Everton\u2019s Kieran Dowell on a season\u2019s loan. \u201cWe must be sure which players we will go for. We must try and get the balance right in the team. The market isn\u2019t really so simple at this moment. You always use your contacts in the world of football; there are lots of agents and technical directors. \u201cIf we feel we need a player for this squad we try to convince the other party it would be a good step for a loan player to come to our team for his development and to create value for next season. Many players, are they available or not because the Premier League clubs don\u2019t have their teams fixed yet. But there will be a lot more movement in the next two weeks I am sure. Derby also has really good relationships with a lot of good teams.\u201d Cocu\u2019s assistants, Twan Scheepers and Chris van der Weerden, as well as the specialist first-team coach, Liam Rosenior, sat in on a series of interviews with broadcasters and national media and the overriding sense from Cocu was that this is the perfect marriage after three months in charge of Fenerbahce, who sacked him in October. \u201cThe president had certain ideas but for many reasons what we had in mind was just not possible,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cThere was a Uefa sanction. To work in the way we wanted, it didn\u2019t work out but that is also football. But it doesn\u2019t change how I look into a club before I step. After a few conversations you get the feeling: \u2018This is the way I think about football and the way I want to develop and play with my team. It\u2019s a fit, it\u2019s a match; let\u2019s go for it.\u2019 You never get 100% guarantees it will work out but the feeling we have now is really good.\u201d Mel Morris, the Derby owner, suggested the club had added around \u00a330m-\u00a340m to the market values of Mount, Tomori and Wilson, owing to how the trio thrived last season. Of Cocu, Morris said it quickly became clear during their first meeting in London that the former midfielder was energised by the philosophy in place. \u201cI came away with Stephen Pearson, my CEO, and I said if he turns us down, we are going to struggle with the next set of interviews after this one because Phillip was very, very good,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe were amazed he was available. We\u2019d done our homework on him, and he on us. I said to him right at the beginning, if this is about a Premier League money or salary then we can\u2019t do that, but if he is literally looking to bounce back from what happened at Fenerbahce, then maybe he will find this is a great home for him. When we met, we could sense that excitement from him about what we are trying to do.\u201d Morris, asked whether he felt Derby needed a high-profile appointment to counteract the departure of Lampard, replied: \u201cI heard the players talk about the respect for what Frank was asking them to do and Frank\u2019s ability to be able to demonstrate those things, and to illustrate parts. People do not question that level of talent. \u201cYou can have a manager that comes on board and it takes longer to get that belief from a manager that has not played. If you have someone who has done it before, I think players do respect that massively. Teams fall apart because belief gets shattered, belief disappears, belief that \u2018we can do it\u2019, belief in the manager\u2019s tactics. They are the things that cause you those dips and it is how you bounce back and get the belief reinstated that is the key.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
