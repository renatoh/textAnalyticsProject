Topping the list of institutions seeing a big boost in student numbers was the University of Bedfordshire, with an astonishing 41.2% rise on last year. Vice-chancellor Les Ebdon pointed to the generous bursary scheme, new sports science centre and the learning pod for the surge of interest. Cynics wonder if the recent name change - this time last year it was the University of Luton - could have worked miracles on its student appeal. \u00b7 Dons at Clare College, Cambridge, are working themselves into a lather after the student publication Clareification printed the cartoon of the prophet Muhammad that triggered riots when it was printed by a Danish newspaper. It appeared next to a picture of Clare's union president, with the cartoon captioned with the president's name, and vice versa. One, the paper suggested, was a \"violent paedophile\" and the other \"a prophet of God, great leader and an example to us all\". The student responsible is being disciplined, and a senior college member apparently claims the publication is racist. The National Secular Society's Terry Sanderson has written to Clare's master: \"Satire aimed at religion is no different to satire aimed at any other ideas ... The freedom to poke fun at those who take themselves too seriously is a time-honoured tradition in this country.\" \u00b7 The proposed academy in Islington, north London, is in trouble again. When the public consultation took place last summer, admissions arrangements were to be rather like those of the existing school, Islington Green. That gives those who live near the school the best chance of getting in. But the new sponsors want new arrangements. The City of London Corporation wants 10 children every year from the City of London, and thereafter children from Islington are to get priority, even if they live further from the school than the (often much poorer) children from Hackney. M'learned friend has been consulted. \u00b7 Not every student wasted half-term in front of a screen. A group from Blackpool and the Fylde College set out to construct the world's largest chip butty - and they are claiming success with a 17-stone, stomach-heaving monster. All those marketing campaigns in recent years to persuade the public that Blackpool is in fact a desirable and chic resort and that holiday-makers ought not to be slumming it in the Med or the Aegean have not, one fears, quite hit the mark. But pictures of students troughing on a 5ft-wide chip butty might just do the trick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
