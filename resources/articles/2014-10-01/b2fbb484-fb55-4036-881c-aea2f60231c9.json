The results, published in the Australian on Tuesday, show the Liberal-National Coalition\u2019s primary vote has dropped to 38% \u2013 three points lower than the previous poll four weeks ago, and its lowest level in three months. Labor\u2019s primary vote remained steady at 34% while support for the Greens rose three points to 14% and support for independents and other parties was unchanged at 14%. These figures translate to a two-party-preferred result of 53% for Labor (up two points since last month) and 47% for the Coalition (down two points). Since the previous poll, the Australian government has formally committed to military action in Iraq, pushed ahead with an expansion of security agency powers, talked tough about the Russian president, and rejected Labor\u2019s call to send health teams to west Africa to help contain Ebola. The telephone poll of 1161 voters between Friday and Sunday shows the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, each recorded a three-point decline in their satisfaction ratings. About 38% of respondents said they were satisfied with Abbott\u2019s performance while 53% expressed dissatisfaction, equating to a net approval score of minus 15 points. Satisfaction with Shorten\u2019s performance was 35% and dissatisfaction was 46%, or a net score of minus 11 points. Asked to nominate their preferred prime minister, 39% opted for Abbott and 38% for Shorten. In a one-off extra question, Newspoll asked voters whether they were in favour of Abbott\u2019s intention to \u201cconfront\u201d the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July. About 63% expressed support while 27% were against a confrontation. Newspoll said the maximum margin of sampling error for the results was 3%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
