The head coach, Stuart Lancaster, must now identify a new centre pairing as a result of Tuilagi's withdrawal with an ankle problem and is also pondering several other delicate selection issues. Tuilagi was always struggling to face the Scots and is not yet guaranteed to be available for the subsequent away trip to Ireland, even though there is talk of him returning to full training next week. He has strained the upper part of his ankle and Lancaster said he will not play if there is a risk of aggravating the injury. Top of the list of replacement centres to play alongside Brad Barritt, assuming Lancaster sticks to his policy of deploying Owen Farrell at fly-half, is Gloucester's uncapped Billy Twelvetrees, who appears a likelier starter than London Irish's Jonathan Joseph. Twelvetrees has all the running, passing and kicking skills necessary to play international rugby and, at 6ft 3in tall and almost 16 stone, possesses a physical presence as well. Lancaster is not due to finalise his starting XV until Thursday but he made a point of stressing that England cannot afford to be outmuscled by a hefty Scottish outfit. \"They're not a small side so we need to make sure we match them in that area,\" he said. \"I've said all along we want some footballers in our back line but we also have to have the ability to get across the gain-line. I haven't worried in the past about picking uncapped players. This time last year there were seven new caps. I don't see a lack of international experience as a barrier to selection. It's about what's best for the team.\" The absence of Tuilagi, nevertheless, deprives England of a dangerous strike runner. \"I'm not sure there is a like-for-like replacement for Manu so he is a big loss,\" conceded Lancaster. \"If you look at his performance against New Zealand he was outstanding. But this time last year he didn't play in the first two games because of a hamstring injury. We want to make sure he doesn't break down again. Everything I've heard points to the fact he will be running fully and changing direction by this weekend. The medical staff have every confidence he'll be training fully next week.\" Harlequins' Mike Brown is poised to retain his place in the back three having played conspicuously well on the wing against New Zealand. Alex Goode also proved his fitness at the weekend following a shoulder problem; it would be a surprise if he is not retained with Ben Foden offering versatility from the bench. The back five of the scrum is likely to be unchanged, leaving Lancaster a couple of judgment calls in the front row. Dylan Hartley is hopeful of ousting his fast-improving Leicester rival Tom Youngs while Harlequins' Joe Marler has shown decent form in recent weeks and must be a narrow favourite to pip Saracens' Mako Vunipola at loosehead. Alex Corbisiero, the first-choice, will miss the entire championship following knee surgery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
