By the time that he had mostly completed his work, in the 1970s and 1980s, that orthodoxy had been shattered. Friedman's preferred alternative, that monetary policy should be subject to rules designed to achieve price stability, had largely replaced the earlier Keynesian proposals, whereby the authorities should use demand management, mostly in the form of fiscal policy, to aim for the level of unemployment that would offer the best trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Friedman was one of the first to show that that trade-off was illusory. It had been a hopeful illusion. For a brief period in the 1950s and 1960s, it had seemed that the use of Keynesian theory, operating in the context of macro-economic models of the economy that had sprung up under the combined influence of national income statistics and computer technology, would allow economists to guide politicians to steer the economy optimally via discretionary intervention. Friedman instinctively took the liberal view instead: that government intervention was more likely to do harm than good, and that the most government could do was to set an appropriate structure of rules, especially the rule of law, and leave the rest to competition and the freedom of the individual to choose in a system of free markets. Ironically perhaps, one of Friedman's earlier studies, and perhaps his finest econometric contribution, removed a perceived threat to the maintenance of Keynesian full-employment. In Keynes's model, saving was a positive function of income, and from both cross-section studies and casual empiricism it was obvious that the savings ratio, S/Y, rose as income increased. But this suggested that as national incomes rose, the savings ratio would rise inexorably, making it more and more difficult to generate matching investment, and leading eventually to potential stagnation. But the long-term time series data of the savings ratio showed no such tendency to rise. Friedman reconciled these facts in A Theory of the Consumption Function (1957) by showing that income distribution was much influenced by temporary fluctuations in income, for example whether one was at the highest level of earnings in one's life cycle or, alternatively, retired. People would naturally save a large proportion of temporary high incomes to be consumed later when income might be temporarily low. The distinction between temporary and permanent economic conditions has since remained one of the main concepts in macro-economics. Friedman was not, however, an outstanding technician; he was relatively sparing in his use of mathematical models, and towards the end of his active life his use of econometrics, developed in earlier years, ran into some criticism. Nor was he primarily an historian. Yet, with his colleague Anna Schwartz, he wrote the finest ever book on economic history, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960. Schwartz was always a stickler for ensuring the scrupulous accuracy of historical detail, and that, combined with Milton Friedman's vision of a unifying structure for tracing through the effects of monetary developments on the economy, led to a work that not only entertained and informed, but changed our view of how the macro-economy worked. Prior to that book, most people had ascribed the great depression in the US in 1929-33 to the Wall Street crash in 1929 and/or to real factors such as a sharp drop in consumption. Friedman and Schwartz instead made a convincing case that it was inept monetary management by the US Federal Reserve that was the main culprit. But his greatest achievement was to show why government intervention to try to set output and employment at a higher level than would happen naturally without such demand management was ultimately self-defeating and damaging. In the macro-models of the time, Keynesian demand-side equations had been supplemented by a supply-side equation, the Phillips curve, linking nominal wage and price increases to the level of unemployment, (the lower unemployment, the higher inflation); and economists and politicians sought to set the unemployment level so as to achieve their preferred combination of output and inflation. In his presidential address to the American Economic Association in 1967 entitled The Role of Monetary Policy\", reprinted in the American Economic Review (1968), Friedman noted that economic agents - wage earners, firm managers etc - were primarily concerned with their real incomes and real profits, not just nominal outcomes. Because contracts are set in nominal terms, they would agree to a nominal wage, or set a price, which, conditional on their expectations of future inflation, would get them their desired real outcome. So the short-run Phillips curve was conditioned on agents' inflationary expectations. If then the government used this (short-run) relationship to try to achieve a lower unemployment/higher inflation outcome than private sector agents had been expecting as the norm then, after some time, expectations would adjust upwards. So long as governments insisted on keeping unemployment below its natural rate, actual and expected inflation would chase each other ever upwards in an unending vicious spiral. This was indeed what seemed to be happening in the 1970s, the decade that brought the earlier optimism about controlled economic expansion to a shuddering halt. It was, indeed, in this period that \"monetarism\" as an approach, and Milton Friedman as its leading exponent, were at their most influential. Country after country, including a somewhat reluctant Labour government in the UK in 1976, embraced monetary targets and renounced belief in an ability to spend one's way out of economic difficulties. Whereas Friedman had done a devastating job in dismantling what then became known as \"naive Keynesianism\", (in contrast to the various strands of new Keynesianism that reformulated the analysis in the light of such criticisms), his positive proposals have been less successful. He had earlier reinterpreted the demand for money as an exercise in portfolio choice, for example in his paper The Quantity Theory of Money - A Restatement, in the book of essays Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money, which he edited (1956); though this was not in reality that much of a break with existing Keynesian ideas. Friedman believed that the demand for money would be a predictable function of a few variables, and that that functional relationship would remain stable over time; indeed early econometric work in the 1960s (Goldfeld, Laidler) suggested that this might be so - though Friedman's own empirical work (eg his article on The Demand for Money in the Journal of Political Economy [1959]) again ran into econometric criticism. On that basis, Friedman argued in A Program for Monetary Stability (1960) that the rate of growth of money should be kept constant: the famous K% rate of growth. Even if there were some unpredictable fluctuations in the demand for money, the resulting disturbances to nominal incomes would be much less, he believed, than would result from the ill-advised attempts at discretionary management by central banks. As a natural liberal, Friedman tended to doubt whether the powerful could be trusted to increase the welfare of the people. Perhaps more importantly, he demonstrated in The Effects of a Full-Employment Policy on Economic Stability: A Formal Analysis, in Essays in Positive Economics (1953), that, in order to enhance welfare, the authorities had to be able to predict future events with significantly more than 50% accuracy. Given the difficulty of forecasting, and the \"long and variable lags\", as described in The Lag in Effect of Monetary Policy and in The Optimum Quantity of Money and Other Essays (1969), between adjusting monetary instruments and their effect on the economy, the likelihood that intervention, even if undertaken with the purest of motives, would actually prove beneficial was slim. In his advocacy for this regime change, to bring about a shift from discretion to a rule for monetary growth, he was conspicuously unsuccessful. Demand for money functions, which had previously seemed stable, commonly broke down once employed as an intermediate monetary target. Alternative definitions of the money stock often pointed in different directions, causing \"broad money\" monetarists to argue with \"narrow-money\" monetarists. While central bankers in the 1970s and early 1980s termed themselves \"pragmatic monetarists\", they remained determined to conduct monetary policy by discretionary variations in short-term interest rates. Friedman refused to get caught up in a discussion of which monetary aggregate was in some normative sense the best one to use. His methodology, outlined in The Methodology of Positive Economics in Essays in Positive Economics (1953), was that you should use the method that works best, that best explains and predicts final outcomes in terms of the most parsimonious set of explanatory variables. This approach was controversial. But it was a dangerous exercise to argue a point with him, especially in open debate. He was a brilliant and incisive debater, and his skill in argument was phenomenal. Along with George Stigler, he led intellectual discussion among economists at Chicago. It is, perhaps, in his application of logic to macro-economic analysis that he was supreme. His command over detailed fact was, however, occasionally less sure than his analytical ability, as evidenced for example by his claim that Japan was an example of a liberal economy. Although a devastating debater, he was a naturally kind and easily approachable person, of small stature, a bit like a genial gnome - and he was prepared to change his mind when convinced, as occurred famously in the case of the discussion of the Coase Theorem. Friedman believed that government intervention did harm, and that the best economy would be a liberal free-market economy, as expressed vibrantly in Capitalism and Freedom (1962). In his more political writing on this topic, he was much helped by the collaboration of his wife, Rose, who wrote both Free to Choose (1980) and the Tyranny of the Status Quo (1984) with him. They had a very long and devoted marriage; they supported each other and took great joy in being together. He was born in New York. Although his name will always be connected with Chicago University, he did his undergraduate training at Rutgers University (BA 1932) and received his PhD from Columbia University in 1946, though he did his graduate training at Chicago (MA 1933) Between 1933 and 1941 he worked, on research, at the National Resources Committee and the National Bureau of Economic Research. During the war, like so many other economists, he worked in government agencies, first for the US Treasury and then for the Division of War Research at Columbia. But it was at Chicago, where he returned as Professor of Economics in 1948 and stayed till 1983, where he became an outstanding figure, receiving the Nobel Prize for economics in 1976, and numerous other awards. In the Department of Economics at Chicago he found a congenial atmosphere. There was a tradition there of a preference for rules over discretion, and a liberal distrust for government intervention in the economy. Henry Simons and Lloyd Mints directly, and Frank Knight and Jacob Viner at one remove, had continued to base their macro-monetary analysis on the quantity theory of money in contrast to the IS/LM Keynes/Hicks model. While at Chicago, he found and encouraged a pre-eminent group of academic colleagues, of whom perhaps George Stigler was the other greatest star, with more University of Chicago economists receiving Nobel prizes than those of any other centre. After retiring from Chicago, he moved to the Hoover Institute in California, where he continued to work, travel and teach almost up to his death, though he always took a break for the summer in his beloved holiday home in New England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
