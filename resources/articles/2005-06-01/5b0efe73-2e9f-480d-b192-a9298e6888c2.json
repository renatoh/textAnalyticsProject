Peter Wareing, 40, may have been kicked in the head as he lay on the pavement. He was walking with two friends, a man and woman, along a residential street in the Parkstone area of Poole, in Dorset, when they were attacked at about midnight on Saturday night. Without warning, a teenage girl grabbed the 34-year-old woman by her hair and punched her to the ground. The 34-year-old man stepped in to help her but was pushed over a garden wall by some of the youths. The three friends tried to walk away, and as they did so Mr Wareing was punched to the ground. His head struck the pavement and he was knocked unconscious. Doctors believe he may also have been kicked in the head. The gang then fled. Mr Wareing, who is newly qualified and lives with his wife, Elizabeth, 39, a nurse, and her three sons aged 11, 10 and eight, was taken to Poole hospital, but was transferred to the neurological unit at Southampton general hospital, where his condition is described as critical. The two friends were released from hospital after treatment for injuries to their faces. Mr Wareing's family and police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. His mother-in-law, Pauline Pereira, 59, appealed for information. \"Anyone who knows anything, please come forward to try to catch the people that have done this,\" she said. \"Peter is in a critical condition and is in a coma. One of his eyes is totally closed up, but below the neck he has no injuries and the doctors think he was kicked in the head. Detective Inspector Steve Thorpe, of Poole CID, said: \"This was a totally unprovoked attack on three friends as they were walking home after enjoying themselves at a private barbecue nearby.\" He said it was obvious that the teenagers involved had been \"spoiling for trouble\" before the attack. He added:\"It's quite likely that those in the group didn't intend for anyone to be as severely injured as has happened and I'm appealing to them to search their consciences and please come forward. \"How would you feel if the injured man was your father?\" he said. He added: \"It's likely - because there were a number of young people involved - that word will spread about this assault and those responsible, and I'm appealing to anyone with such information to contact me in confidence.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
