With Ronson visiting Australia, and his recent fascination with Perth musician Kevin Parker of Tame Impala fame, we asked for his take on the local scene. How did your collaboration with Kevin come about? He features quite heavily on your third album, Uptown Special. I loved their band and would always see them play in London. We talked about doing some kind of side project, which never materialised. And then [Kevin] sent me this demo of a funk record he\u2019d been working on. It didn\u2019t even have a name and it was just so cool. When I started working on my album, I had some ideas for some songs and kept hearing his voice in my head. I asked if he would come down to Memphis and just hang out. Obviously he\u2019s in one of the biggest bands in the world; they\u2019re always touring and I think their album had just been named in every single best album of the year list. So for him to take a week out of his life to come to Memphis was pretty awesome. Not only did he sing the songs, just having him around \u2013 the way he plays drums, his voice on background harmonies, all the little touches that he added \u2013 just made everything a little bit cooler and better. It sounds like quite a different Kevin Parker on your album compared with his work with Tame Impala. Did hearing that funk demo help open up those possibilities? For me, his voice is always the most defining element of the music. As soon as I hear his voice it feels like Tame Impala. I guess to some people it does sound like a departure from that stuff but for me it just sounds like him and that makes it cool. Can you describe the qualities of his voice that make it so special? It\u2019s ethereal, detached and angelic. A lot of my favourite music is like that \u2013 there\u2019s something so pure in his delivery, but it\u2019s overwhelmingly melancholy, like Lonerism. You also invited Australian musician Kirin J Callinan to play on the album. Yeah, I saw him play at the wedding of this Australian skateboard legend named Dustin Dollin in Paris. He sung INXS\u2019s Never Tear Us Apart in the church after the ceremony. It was pretty beautiful with the organ. Then I went back to the wedding party and he also played. It\u2019s a wedding so you\u2019d expect the bands to start playing Earth, Wind and Fire and Beyonc\u00e9. [Instead] he had 30 Roland guitar pedals around him and this amp. It blew everyone\u2019s minds. Afterwards I said: \u201cI have this song that I think you will be great to play solo on, would you come if you happen to be in London?\u201d I honestly don\u2019t know anybody else who could have played what he played because that song is really unique to him. He\u2019s a pretty monster musician, and an incredible performer! We DJ\u2019d together last night, back-to-back. He\u2019d be playing the most crazy techno remix of Game of Thrones, or Savage Garden\u2019s I Want You, or a hip-hop record. Are there any other Australian musicians you\u2019d be interested in working with in the future? I couldn\u2019t say because I don\u2019t know who would be interested in working with me, but there\u2019s certainly some amazing talent coming out of here \u2013 more than any other time I can really remember. Some of the most exciting music is coming from Australia \u2013 like Jagwar Ma. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion recently surrounding Iggy Azalea and her appropriation \u2013 possibly misappropriation \u2013 of African American culture. You\u2019ve worked with many great African American artists \u2013 do you ever feel you face similar challenges? Ever since I started DJing in hip-hop clubs in New York this was the music I loved. And I\u2019ve never really pretended to be anything that I\u2019m not. Never pretended to be hood when I\u2019m not. And maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve just been accepted \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure. At the same time, I\u2019m very respectful and I understand where it all comes from. That was part of going through the South \u2013 going to those churches \u2013 really understanding the roots of this music that we love, because it\u2019s really hard to remember that every single genre of music pretty much nowadays comes from American black music: so jazz, soul, gospel, funk, which then became hip-hop; pop music came from rock \u2019n\u2019 roll which was from there too. Of course, there\u2019s a little bit of European influence with classical chords but for the most part it is from African American culture. You got to be respectful of your place within something that you didn\u2019t really create, but it\u2019s the thing that I love the most and I wouldn\u2019t know what else to do. You\u2019re famous for collaborations. It it a case of recognising star quality in someone, or more about feeling a connection? When it starts I\u2019m only thinking about the music. Who\u2019s the best person for this song? And that\u2019s it. You\u2019re listening and writing a song and thinking, \u201cman, you know whose voice would sound really good over this?\u201d In the case of Keyonne Starr \u2013 the singer we met in Jackson, Mississippi, and put on the record \u2013 we wrote a song and couldn\u2019t think of anyone to sing it. So Jeff [Bhasker] was like: \u201cLet\u2019s go drive to the South and find someone.\u201d It sounds so hokey but the music tells you what you need to get. Much the same way a director works with a team of actors, cinematographers and editors? It\u2019s not a bad analogy. I think so many producers do different things. In the hip-hop context, Timbaland and RZA, they make the music and then the singer or the rapper does their thing. Rick Rubin probably has a vision \u2013 he\u2019s not so hands-on in the studio with equipment and gear but gets these amazing performances out of people and gives people guidance in making a record. It\u2019s different for me because it can vary song to song but I kind of write the music, or at least co-write it, and then do the arrangements, play the instrumentation and engineer it. So you\u2019re doing a lot of the little roles: half boom operator, half casting agent, half screen writer and then half actor if you\u2019re playing on it. Maybe you\u2019re not the lead actor \u2013 like in Uptown Funk I would be Robert Duvall in the Godfather. I\u2019m not Pacino, but you\u2019re doing an important part that holds it down. \u2022 Mark Ronson\u2019s third album Uptown Special is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
