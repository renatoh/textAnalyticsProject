Try Elf Academy", "bodyText": "Do you believe in Father Christmas? You'd better if you want a place at the world's oddest educational establishment, the Elf Academy just launched by Lapland Vocational College. Its one-year course is aimed at the men and women who act as Santa's little helpers in Finland's northernmost province, greeting visitors at the airport, leading them on safaris through the snow and, of course, organising that vital photo with a jolly fat man. \"The most important thing for an elf,\" says Kari Rekil\u00e4, the college's project manager, \"is to believe in Santa.\" Priority number two, apparently, is to prevent tourists from losing bits of themselves to frostbite, with temperatures regularly reaching -30C. Such professionalism wouldn't go amiss elsewhere. David Sedaris, the American author of SantaLand Diaries, once spent a month as an elf at Macy's department store in New York. He recalls telling a misbehaving child that Santa would burgle his home, leaving him in the dark without even a blanket to huddle under. \"Crumpet\", as he was known, soon had visions of being stoned to death by angry customers, and would probably have deserved it. Closer to home, the Guardian's Rosie Swash was less than impressed by her training for a month at one of London's up-market grottoes. Her only preparation, she remembers, was being told how to explain her un-elflike height: \"Santa gave us special magic powder to make us bigger so we could help him more.\" The store's three Santas were all \"a bit pervy\", and their assistants soon learned to keep clear of their laps. The Americans at least are trying to clean up their act. Founded in 1994, the Professional Association of Santa's Elves is open to anyone who \"desires to put a smile on a child's face\", but members can be expelled for inappropriate behaviour, while officials can lose their posts for \"demeanor unbefitting the good name of Santa Claus\". Which raises the question of whether Santas themselves need a professional qualification. Lapland used to run classes for them, and Rekil\u00e4 reckons about 20 passed through his college's doors. But the idea of officially endorsed Father Christmases raises all sorts of difficult questions. After all, as Rekil\u00e4 is the first to admit: \"There's only one real Santa.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
