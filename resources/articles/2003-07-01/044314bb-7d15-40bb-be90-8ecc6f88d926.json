In much the same way as you might get some perverse enjoyment from listening to a David Blaine performance on the radio, Dead Ringers is the perfect programme to switch on and not to watch. Unlike Ronni Ancona, who can somehow physically embody both Victoria Beckham and Ruby Wax, Jan Ravens's brilliance is entirely vocal. I loved her prissy-yet-slightly-saucy Kirstie Allsopp from Location Location Location, while a pedantic Delia and querulous Joan Bakewell ('I'm getting on a bit but you still would, wouldn't you?') were equally spot-on. But there's no getting away from the fact that I enjoyed most of these impressions with my back to the telly, so it's probably fair to say that Dead Ringers has still to make a convincing transition from radio. I did cheat and glance occasionally, though, so I know that it's not just Jan's fault - Jon Culshaw's Blair looked like Rory Bremner doing almost anybody you'd care to name other than Blair, while Phil Cornwell doing Greg Dyke as Michael Caine really needed to look a bit more like Dyke in order to stop it being - take it slowly here - Caine doing Cornwell doing Dyke. The reason the 'Mattel's Auction Man' sketch, in which Mark Perry did David Dickinson, worked quite well visually was because he was only a few inches high, but the Location... spoof ('another helter-skelter trip into the bleeding obvious') was wholly indistinguishable from a genuine edition of the programme. Indeed, how clever of Ringers to notice that Bleeding Obvious Telly - and let us briefly indulge ourselves in the acronym 'Botty' - is the future of broadcasting, and that the legions of property buying-and-flogging-and-overmaking shows exploit exactly the same Bleeding Obviousnesses week after week: a) don't buy a house in the wrong area that b) you don't like and c) can't afford. And if you want to sell it for anything close to the asking price, a) have your pit bull put down before b) repainting your living room so that it no longer closely resembles the team colours of Aston Villa, West Ham or Newcastle, and finally, c) don't make a pot of fresh coffee and put vanilla pods in your oven because those of us coming to view your home will simply laugh before we walk round the corner and buy a poky-looking place with a black-and-white-striped living room which we instinctively know has enormous potential because, just like everybody else in Britain, we've watched 316 identical makeover shows in the past two years - and that's not counting the repeats on the UK Style channel. The latest 'Botty' is Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen's Design Rules on BBC2. Not 'Design Rules' as in, like, 'Design Rools OK' but, because Laurence is a bit bossy, the Rules of Design. And, needless to say, it's all deliciously Bleeding Obvious. 'This programme is not about style, it's not about taste,' explained Laurence unnecessarily, given that it's presented by Laurence. 'There's a lot of fluffy subjectivity in interior design,' he reminded us, lest we forget that this was the man whose own fluffy subjectivity has reduced some Changing Rooms participants to tears. But this turned out to be the deeply insightful stuff, because we were soon learning that 'height always adds to an impression of space' - though surely it could be argued, quite forcefully, that height is indeed actual space, rather than just an impression of space. Then again, perhaps he meant that height creates a sort of Dead Ringers-style impression of space, in which case the point of it will be almost entirely lost on the telly. Or maybe I'm just rubbish at interior design. Either way, most of us haven't got enough impressions of height because we occupy 'small, badly lit spaces' which would be vastly improved if we simply removed all our belongings, painted the walls and ceiling white and laid pale wood laminate flooring. After promising us no makeovers whatsoever, eventually Laurence couldn't help himself and whisked us into a national-average-sized living room (15ftx14ft, in case you're interested) where he came over all sniffy. 'I don't know about you, but I get a tremendous feeling of conflict and almost combat...' he observed of the you've-been-Tangoed colour scheme. Then he bullied the defenceless cushions ('ditty-dotty, rural revival, bitty-botty' - and I practically fell off my cumfy-wumfy squishy-squashy sofa when he said 'botty'), removed all the 'very many bad-tempered elements' and got some men in to paint the room pale blue - before putting some of the angry stuff back in again. Et voil\u00e0 - a room that apparently played by the Rules. 'Keep watching, it's going to be fab,' Laurence urged. As messages go it was slightly on the Bleedingly Obvious side of subliminal, but I did as I was told none the less, wanting to believe him. Yes, really - for, though I often want to slap Laurence on his bitty-botty, against my better judgment I also find him rather amusing, particularly when he's teamed with earnest Diarmuid Gavin. And even though I wouldn't let him near my precious Anaglypta and vinyl dado frieze if my life depended on it, I will also grudgingly admit that a couple of his Rules were not entirely without foundation. First, three-seater sofas are a waste of the proverbial impression of space because three people will never ever sit on them simultaneously; and second, the horrid-yet-expensive type AB rhesus negative-coloured carpet inherited from a previous owner of my flat is, despite all the white walls, currently sucking light from the rooms like some great big woolly vampire. So it really has to go, like, yesterday. Botty. Aside from some footage of the poet sitting in front of William Morris print curtains, there was disappointingly little on the subject of Philip Larkin's interior decor in Channel 4's otherwise absorbing Love and Death in Hull, though I fancy it probably owed something to the taste and style of his parents who were, by all accounts, a pair of miserable fascists. No doubt they fucked him up, his mum and dad (amusingly, Channel 4 came over all coy and inserted a bleep when James Wilby read Larkin's most famous lines), but at least he was sensible enough not to marry or have children, even as he juggled up to three long-suffering girlfriends at once. Even so, he clearly didn't like women very much and was mostly in love with Kingsley Amis. The feeling was reciprocated because 'both felt they'd encountered someone more brilliant than themselves', according to Amis Jr. There was some lovely archive film of Larkin creeping around Hull's gloomier quarters, including him arriving for work at the Brynmor Jones Library . Here, a sign on the library door read 'No stiletto heels' but it might just as well have said 'No blacks, no Irish, no Jews, no dogs, no fun'. Outside the sun may have been shining but this week the sign on Channel 4's door read 'Here be Dragons' and so, on Thursday night, they kindly invited us Inside the Mind of Paul Gascoigne which, like North Korea, is not a place you want to visit without a guide. Poor Gazza - not only is he terrified of the dark and of being alone, he's an alcoholic and occasional bulimic with attention deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (he's a folder of towels, so his bathroom's probably lovely) and, according to a prof wheeled on to speculate quite convincingly, on top of all this he has Tourette's syndrome: 'I can only begin to guess at the amount of suffering going on inside this man.' I met Gazza once, in the middle of post-1990 World Cup Gazzamania. He was surrounded by dumb and lairy hangers-on but was rather charming and, to my surprise, not dumb at all. Even when he stuck his tongue out at me in a chummy sort of way it didn't seem particularly odd or inappropriate. In retrospect I guess his extreme fame blinded me to the fact that few adult men stick their tongues out when they shake your hand. Anyway, after an hour inside Gazza's mind, I had the feeling that, if he carries on drinking his way through the last few minutes of the party before the clock strikes midnight, he's less likely to end up as a coach than he is as a pumpkin. I really hope he finds someone to take him home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
