And deservedly so, too, for they produced some marvellous running rugby that was reminiscent of the latter stages of their World Cup campaign in Australia last year and the game against Scotland in the first contest of this Six Nations championship. Some of the fare since then has not been of the greatest, but a demanding Welsh public might just forgive Hansen that if he has laid the foundations of a brighter future. The ovation that he was accorded by the near-capacity crowd, when he stepped on to the turf after the end of the game, suggests that a rosier hue does indeed suffuse the Welsh horizon. There was even the hint of a tear or two being wiped away by the New Zealander. On a day that was wrought with emotion, Gareth Thomas scored his thirty-fourth touchdown in Wales colours to surpass the try-scoring record of the onlooking Ieuan Evans, while 35-year-old lock Gareth Llewellyn won his eighty-seventh cap to equal Neil Jenkins' record of Wales appearances. It was that sort of afternoon and it was almost as if the gods decried that Wales should produce, by some distance, their most consummate performance of this year's championship. They did. They were quickly out of the blocks, effecting a fluent 10-phase passage of play in the opening two minutes, and were only denied an early score by a resilient Italian defence that would later leak four tries in 15 second-half minutes. No matter. With Stephen Jones pulling Wales' strings from fly-half and the home line-out functioning more smoothly than in recent times, there was little shortage of quick, quality ball. Jones soothed home nerves with a pair of penalty goals before Iestyn Harris created the opening try after 25 minutes with the most sumptuous of flat passes for Rhys Williams to burst on to through the inside-centre channel on his own 10-metre line. Sixty metres later, Williams was hauled down two metres short of what would have been a sensational touchdown, but the ball was quickly recycled to the open side, where Shane Williams wriggled over. It was the Williams wing of the Rhys variety who created clear water five minutes later when he scored in the right corner following a crisp move up the short side by Gareth Cooper and Thomas off the back of a scrum. Wales also spurned several other opportunities before the break, notably when Mark Taylor knocked on when diving over the line in the corner. Still, a half-time lead of 16-0 was comfort enough for the home side. The Azzurri put some decent phases together, notably in the third quarter when Wales were unable to maintain their frenetic earlier pace, but the lack of penetration and creativity among the visiting backs was all too apparent. Still, they did score only their second try of the championship when centre Andrea Masi forced his way over just after the hour, which was just reward for a team that battled hard and kept putting in their tackles but were simply outclassed. By then, Jones had already released Thomas for his record-breaking try whereupon Tom Shanklin, who had replaced Iestyn Harris a matter of seconds earlier, gleefully latched on to Robin McBryde's deft pass to scoot home. With Colin Charvis and Michael Owen enjoying cracking games up front, though Martyn Williams was not far behind, Wales continued to swing the ball from side to side. And both of the flying Williams wings took the opportunity to double their try tally for the afternoon as the Italians were run ragged. So Hansen takes his leave of the land of the dragon to head home to his native New Zealand, where he will form part of a triumvirate - alongside Graham Henry, his predecessor in Wales, and Wayne Smith, the Northampton coach - attempting to restore All Black glories. It will be fascinating to see how Hansen's legacy in Wales unfolds, for his statistics do not make the prettiest reading. Of the 33 matches played under his two-year stewardship, Wales were successful in just 11, with no victory against any of the big five and not a single win on the road in the Six Nations. But Hansen's legacy should be regarded in a different light from the one left by Henry - and not just because the advent of Welsh regional sides promises to bring a harder, more competitive edge to the national side. The pivotal difference between the two New Zealanders is this. Whereas Henry left the team much as he found it (same old players back in the habit of losing), Hansen has at least cast his net farther and wider than Henry ever dared to do, nor has be been afraid to give youth its chance. There are still plenty of things to work on - like the front five for instance - but that is for another day. Man of the Match Stephen Jones The Wales fly-half missed two conversions and a pair of long-range penalty goal attempts but, those blemishes apart, he enjoyed a cracking match. His distribution, outstanding all afternoon, was a throwback to days of old, as he ran the show. His line kicking was near-perfect and nor was he afraid to carry out his share of defensive duties.
