Aged 101. Plus, political activist Hetty, 102, and journalist Alison, 87: \"I always tell people I'm living in a home for aged intellectuals, but it's not entirely true.\" Yet for the next hour, these residents of north London's Mary Feilding Guild, a home for the active elderly, expound wittily and movingly on subjects from sex to death and everything in between. Elderly women are all but invisible on television. If only for 60 minutes, this film magnificently redresses the balance. The Street 9pm, BBC1 Anna Friel returns to British TV tonight as Jimmy McGovern's excellent series continues. She's a single mum trying to get her two sons into a better school, pay the mortgage and hold down two jobs; she's a DIY shop assistant in the week, and works on the weekends in a sauna as \"Ruby\". After her boiler packs in and plumber Daniel Mays walks into her kitchen, the fragile borders of a carefully compartmentalised life are eroded, with typical gut-wrenching effect. Monday Monday 9pm, ITV1 Despite every fibre of its being screaming \"I am but a competent ITV comedy-drama\", Monday Monday is pretty likable. In this second episode Fay Ripley's Christine is in AA and trying to take back control of her working life. That's all well and good, except that she has to deal with a sexual harassment claim against resident office hunk Steven, who also happens to be sleeping with scary chief operating officer Alyson. Awkward. It's so light as to be weightless, but with a great cast (featuring Jenny Agutter, Holly Aird and the charming Morven Christie) it's definitely watchable. One Tree Hill 9pm, E4 As One Tree Hill goes, you can always be guaranteed some kind of heart-wrenching event, but this particular episode takes the proverbial biscuit. As the town copes with a shocking murder, the characters contemplate death \u2013 mainly in sentimental, tearjerking speeches. Even the children are engaged in some kind of existential crisis. It's so relentless, in fact, you might find yourself looking forward to Dan and Carrie's bizarre torture scenes as some kind of respite. Nonetheless, this episode is certainly One Tree Hill doing what only One Tree Hill can: drama, intrigue and a fantastically infectious soundtrack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
