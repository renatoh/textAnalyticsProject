No we can't", "bodyText": "Some Americans believe that the recession has provided us with a \"laboratory\" in which we can determine once and for all whether the stimulus theories of John Maynard Keynes actually work, or whether the hands-off approach favoured by Friederich Hayek and Milton Friedman makes more sense. Once one theory is vindicated, so the reasoning goes, the debate will be closed forever, and adherents of the discredited viewpoint will be forced to admit that they backed the wrong horse. Like most theories being bandied about these days, this one is stupid. I have breakfast several times a week with two diehard Republicans who sincerely believe that Barack Obama is personally responsible for the parlous condition of the stockmarket. One is in his 40s; one in his 80s. When the liberals at the table object that the disastrous condition of the market is the fault of George Bush, Paul Paulson, AIG, Citigroup and assorted other villains, the Obama-bashers sneer. It's Obama's giveaways that have rattled investors, not a deteriorating economy. They further believe that because Bill Clinton bequeathed his successor a damaged economy, Bush cannot be blamed for the recession that began his administration, nor for the one that ended it. One thing you have to say for Jack and Adam: they're not afraid to take unpopular positions in a state where saying nice things about George Bush is practically a hanging offence. I, personally, am not interested in the merits of these arguments. Like many other Americans, I don't care who stole my life's savings; I simply want them back. I am like the East End tart who doesn't care if Jack the Ripper is brought to justice, but would be overjoyed if he stayed out of Whitechapel for a while. What does interest me, from a purely academic perspective, is why anyone would blame Obama for a meltdown that started 18 months ago. Obviously, much of this animus can be traced to Rush Limbaugh and the other gasbags on talk radio. Bush himself has certainly helped things along by keeping a very low profile; it calls to mind the situation in 1793 France, when Robespierre and the boys frogmarched Louis XVI to the guillotine in part because Louis XIV \u2013 the king who actually wrecked the French economy \u2013 was no longer around. Setting aside the possibility that the rancour directed toward the president may be racial in nature \u2013 a possibility I reject out of hand \u2013 let us assume that their antipathy arises from more pristine ideological springs. To whit: my friends don't like this guy, they don't like what this guy stands for, and they never will. I do not find such a mindset hard to understand. There are certain people we dislike so intensely that to modify our feelings about them would be to jettison our own identities. Consider a frivolous example. I grew up despising [Frankie Valli and] the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons apotheosised everything I hated about pop music. They were bland, they were slick, they were hokey, they were not the Rolling Stones. Thus, when I am asked if I have seen Jersey Boys, friends cannot understand the venom with which the question is greeted. Don't you know what I stand for? Haven't you noticed that my record collection runs the gamut from David Bowie to Talking Heads to Mission of Burma, but scrupulously avoids the geriatric schlock of the Four Seasons? Why don't you ask me if I've seen Mamma Mia while you're at it? Revising my opinion of the Four Seasons would necessitate the same kind of tectonic, 180-degree shift in values that my two friends would have to experience before changing their attitude toward the president. This is why I find the laboratory theory idiotic. People have way too much riding on some issues to ever admit they are wrong. Moreover, ideological arguments are rarely, if ever, closed. Some historians and journalists \u2013 though mostly the third-rate ones \u2013 still debate whether the New Deal saved America from the Depression or made a bad situation worse. There is no unassailable verdict as to whether Brutus was a hero or a snake. If Oliver Cromwell was such a monster \u2013 bear in mind that his mutilated corpse did end up on a dung heap \u2013 why is his jaunty statue standing right outside the Houses of Parliament? Jean-Jacques Rousseau is still a big hit on college campuses, but Bertrand Russell believed that a direct line could be traced from his works to Mein Kampf. These arguments are not closed, and they never will be. Which is why it is absurd to repeat the hackneyed bromide that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it in part because even those who can remember the past cannot agree on what actually happened. Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that the economy did revive in the next six months, and the stockmarket returned to the stratosphere. Would that force hardcore Obama-haters to revise their opinion of him? No. To understand why, we need only gaze across the Atlantic. To this day, many left-leaning English people who came of age in the 1970s, the era of the Clash, detest Margaret Thatcher, even though Margaret Thatcher made them all rich. Fascism did not come to Great Britain as a result of Margaret Thatcher's policies; prosperity did. As I pointed out in the Guardian two years ago, London Calling is the anthem of the side that lost the war. But to cede even an inch of terrain, even at this late date, would be to admit that Thatcher was right about the British economy and those on the left were wrong. This is odious, insupportable. So many left-leaning Brits beguile themselves into thinking that their grubby Hackney homes quadrupled in value because of their own canny investing acumen, not because Thatcher created a new society in which a London homeowner would literally have to be a nitwit not to get rich. My rightwing friends feel the same way. Even if the market rebounded, they would never be willing to give Obama any credit. They would insist that the economy had revived because that's what economies do. They are sticking to their guns, because this thing is personal. Sorry, Mr Keynes.
