Collectively these three diseases are the country's biggest killers and the communities most vulnerable are in rural areas like Katine. It is not surprising, then, that health programmes in Katine continue to focus their resources on responding to the threat posed by HIV, TB and malaria. In line with medical programmes across Africa, the health priorities of the the African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref) in Katine focus on an integrated approach to tackling these diseases. \"The formal health system in Uganda does not have the capacity to tackle the spread of these diseases at community level,\" says Susan Wandera, deputy director at Amref Uganda. \"It is only building a response at local and household level and raising education and awareness and tackling stigma that you'll really be able to make a dent in the chaos these three illnesses are having in rural areas like Katine.\" But does this focus on the three big diseases mean programmes for other life-threatening illnesses are neglected? A recent report by the George Institute for International Health in Australia said that the global focus on HIV/Aids, malaria and TB is leading to a serious shortfall in funding for other \"neglected\" diseases responsible for killing millions of people across the world. The report found that collectively HIV/Aids, TB and malaria received nearly 80% of the $2.5bn invested in the research and development of diseases across the developing world in 2007. \"The reality is you're more likely to survive if you're an Aids patient than if you have diabetes in a rural community like Katine,\" says Dr Ruth McNerney, from the department of infectious and tropical diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"Although these diseases have a disproportional effect in terms of numbers, many other killer illnesses are going unchecked.\" At Ojom health centre, Richard Okello, the district nurse, outlines the most common health problems he has to deal with in Katine. \"The biggest problem we face on a day to day level is malaria,\" says Okello, who describes the disease as \"rampant\" in Katine. \"The problem is that because of the problems with drugs supply, we usually don't have enough or any malaria medicine to give people.\" Currently the Ojom clinic doesn't have any first-line malaria drugs left in stock. \"The problem is a lot of our patents are very poor so they can't afford to go straight on to second-line treatment,\" he says. \"As a nurse you sympathise and feel really bad for them and just pray that the patient will be helped by a drug delivery but it doesn't always happen.\" Many of the other common health problems in Katine are linked to unclean water and poor sanitation. Aside from malaria, the majority of people seeking help at Ojom have diarrhoeal illnesses, intestinal worms, and eye and skin conditions. Respiratory tract infections are also rife. Although if untreated many of these illnesses and diseases can lead to more serious medical problems, Ojom's drug stock cupboard can only come up with paracetamol or one tub of doxycylene, a basic antibiotic. Ojom has also dealt with increasing cases of dysentery and occasional outbreaks of measles and cholera, although Okello says the numbers of children coming to the clinic with these problems has decreased since Amref's immunisation drive. Now the Ojom laboratory has opened for business, locals will soon be able to get diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and malaria. \"We hope things will get better,\" says Okello. \"What is hard is that many of the health problems that people come with can be treated and prevented, but we don't have the resources or the time to get out and help tackle them at household level.\" As well as helping reduce the threat of the big three, there is hope that the village health teams (VHTs) will be able to reduce some other health problems, such as eye and skin infections and intestinal works, which place such a burden on Katine's already overstretched public health services. They are plugging gaps by running outreach services in remote communities, making clinic referrals, running outreach immunisation services, providing household care and promoting personal hygiene and sanitation awareness. Despite the efforts of the VHTs, the challenges ahead are great. According to Joseph Semujju, Amref's health officer in Katine, managing the community's expectations of what the project can deliver in terms of health is an uphill struggle. \"The problem is that people are so worried about health they expect we can come in and provide solutions to everything and we simply don't have the resources to do that,\" he says. \"There is such a huge need for improved health services, for a better drug supply chain, for more and better equipped clinics, but there is a limit to what we can realistically achieve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
