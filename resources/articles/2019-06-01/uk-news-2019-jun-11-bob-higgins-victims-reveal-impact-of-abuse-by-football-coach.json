At the start of his sentencing hearing at Winchester crown court, victim after victim testified that they had suffered decades of mental health problems because of Higgins\u2019s crimes and expressed anger, shame and guilt at what had happened to them. Some told the court they had tried to kill themselves or turned to drink and drugs to try to blot out the abuse. Many said they had struggled over the years with flashbacks, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, lack of trust, and problems with personal relationships. Higgins, 66, from Southampton, has been convicted of sexually abusing 24 schoolboy players during a 25-year period following two trials. He ran youth training programmes at Southampton and Peterborough football clubs and spent a period as the Maltese national youth coach. Over two trials a picture of Higgins emerged of a man who abused his position of power to take advantage of a string of vulnerable players. During the sentencing hearing one victim criticised the FA and Southampton FC over their handling of Higgins. Another said that during a game the former Chelsea captain Dennis Wise had taunted him as being one of \u201cBobby\u2019s boys\u201d. Some of the victims broke down in tears as they gave evidence. Some stared at Higgins as he sat showing little emotion in the dock. The end of each impact statement was greeted with warm applause from the public gallery. One of the most emotional witnesses was the mother of Billy Seymour, a former youth player at Southampton who waived his anonymity to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the case but who died in a car crash earlier this year without being able to witness Higgins being convicted. Jean Seymour read a statement from her late son addressed to Higgins. Seymour said he felt \u201csick to the stomach\u201d that he had felt love towards his former coach and had felt broken by him. \u201cI am in safe hands now, real safe hands, not those you offered me. I am a fighter, this is closure. Goodbye Bob Higgins.\u201d She told the court her son\u2019s mental health problems caused by the trauma of being abused by Higgins had led to him living a \u201cghost of a life\u201d. She said she felt guilt and shame at letting her boy fall into the \u201cclutches of a rampant paedophile\u201d. Some victims addressed Higgins directly in their impact statements. One said he hoped Higgins would now, while going to sleep in prison, feel the fear he had experienced at his hands. Others told how excited they had been when they were scouted by Higgins. \u201cI had no idea he was grooming me,\u201d said one. \u201cI was football crazy. I thought this was my big chance.\u201d One former Southampton youth player said Higgins had treated him \u201clike a son\u201d but it had all come \u201ctumbling down\u201d when he was abused during a soapy massage at a training camp in Kent. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s an anger inside of me, a feeling of disgust that turns my stomach.\u201d The player also posed the questions to the court: \u201cWhere were Southampton? Where were the FA? Where was their due diligence and safeguarding policies? They had a duty of care, a responsibility. Bob Higgins is guilty but it\u2019s also the people in the system who chronically failed us as well.\u201d The theme was picked up by a second former player who said: \u201cI hope Southampton FC and the English FA have learned from their mistakes. I hope proper safeguarding is in place.\u201d Addressing Higgins in the dock, one former player told him: \u201cYou said you loved me and would make me a star.\u201d But he said his dream of making it in the game had turned into a nightmare. \u201cYou sexually and mentally abused me. Behind a mask of affection you created a conveyor belt of abuse.\u201d Yet another reeled off the questions that had plagued him: \u201cWhy did he choose me? Is it my fault? Does it mean I\u2019m gay? Is this normal? Why did I allow it to happen?\u201d He said he had secretly blamed his parents and had dreamed of revenge. Another said Higgins had given him extra kit and taken him to games. \u201cI developed a deep and unhealthy affection for Bob Higgins,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to please him and be his number one.\u201d He said he had become reliant on alcohol and antidepressants. When the football abuse scandal broke he realised his self-destructive nature was down to Higgins. \u201cIt hit me like a sledgehammer. It was like a revelation to me,\u201d he said. One said he was abused by Higgins in a gym. Calling him a monster, he said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t care that we were children. You changed from being a father figure to a bully and sexual predator.\u201d A former Peterborough United youth player told Higgins: \u201cI thought you were a god. You are pure evil, a false prophet, a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. You said you would go to prison for me. You are going to prison Bob. Those are the only true words you have ever spoken to me.\u201d Southampton FC has issued an apology to the victims. Higgins will be sentenced on Wednesday morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
