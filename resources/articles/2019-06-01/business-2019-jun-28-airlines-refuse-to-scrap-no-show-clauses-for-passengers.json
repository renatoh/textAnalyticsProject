Consumer body Which? wrote to nine airlines in December, warning they may be breaking consumer laws by keeping clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger misses the first leg of the same booking, forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights. In many cases airlines can sell on the same tickets, doubling their earnings for one seat. Of the nine airlines, only Flybe told Which? it would change the clauses, although it has not removed them completely. The airlines that retained the clauses were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Air France, Singapore, Qatar and Swiss. KLM said it did not cancel the return flight ticket if the first leg was missed. Instead, it charges an extra fixed-rate fee of between \u20ac125 (\u00a3112) and \u20ac3,000 to passengers at the airport. In one case brought to Which?, a customer was forced to pay more than \u00a3600 to British Airways after he and his wife were barred from the second leg of their return trip from London to Pisa. The customer booked an outbound flight with an alternative airline after the first leg with British Airways was cancelled because of an airline strike, and he was only offered a replacement two days later. Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) added to the pressure on airlines, saying it was concerned by airlines\u2019 failure to remove the no-show clauses. Which? on Friday called for the \u201crip-off\u201d no-show clauses to be banned, following the example set in Austria, which banned the practice in April. Caroline Normand, the consumer group\u2019s director of advocacy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s totally unreasonable for an airline to cancel a passenger\u2019s return flight \u2013 often without warning \u2013 simply because they\u2019ve missed the first leg of their journey. \u201cAirlines have been able to cash in with this tactic for too long, leaving people miserable, stranded and hundreds if not thousands of pounds out of pocket. However, the CAA said in its report that its enforcement powers were limited, meaning government action may be required. The CAA criticised the airlines for their failure to create simple key terms documents, saying it was unfair for passengers to be forced to comply with terms that are not transparent. Airlines argue that the clauses prevent people from taking advantage of offers of return flights, which are cheaper than singles. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to clarify that KLM does not routinely cancel return leg tickets if the outbound flight is missed, but instead charges an extra fixed-rate fee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
