So concluded one local union leader addressing striking prison officers, who cheered wildly at this Prescottian flourish. And then it struck me: how surprised should we be that prisoners, entrusted to the care of such people, so manifestly fail to reform while inside? Are key-jangling jailers models of the ethical, upstanding citizens we would wish the fallen to emulate? Or should we mark the strike by posing a question: is leaving prisons in the hands of 'screws', well, nuts? With apologies to Michael Howard, prison doesn't work: more than half of the people we lock up reoffend within two years, and those are just the ones we catch. However, letting them off, as the former Home Secretary would point out, hardly works either: the average offender commits 140 crimes in the year before he is caught. Moreover, psychologists contend that some - psychopaths, say - are untreatable: so they need to be kept out of circulation, perhaps for longer. And they will need no-nonsense jailers, who might indeed think \u00a38 an hour isn't great for sharing work space with folk with 'hate' tattooed on their knuckles. But what of the rest? Thirty-seven per cent of prisoners are functionally illiterate, more than half are addicts, and 72 per cent are mentally disturbed. Only 10 per cent of jailed addicts have access to treatment; 60 per cent of inmates can't undertake courses inside. If our primary aim with all except genuine lifers is to change future behaviour, why are we still not tackling 'the causes of crime'? Ignore, if you will, de Tocqueville's rebuke that the measure of a civilisation is how it treats its prisoners; just make the hard-headed calculation: 'How am I most likely to avoid being knifed?' Releasing criminals in the condition in which they were captured - just a bit battle hardened after scrapes in the communal showers - is a non-solution. We should flog off Victorian prisons. Many are in city centres and developers would salivate. I've just been invited to stay in an old nick, not at the pleasure of Her Majesty but of a swish hotel chain that converted it. With the proceeds we could build specialist units further out. While prisoners are locked up we have the chance to unlock their potential. This need not be soft: education and treatment could be compulsory. Ditto work: in a pilot scheme in Reading only 7 per cent of non-violent prisoners sent to work in a building yard reoffended. Intriguingly, the public is shifting. A poll shows most people want ministers to find alternatives to prison. Home Secretaries from Howard to Blunkett have competed to threaten the most bloodcurdling punishments, yet most experts suggest this has proved no more of a deterrent than old Pierrepoint's noose. Will politicians ride the mood and risk tabloid wrath? Nick Clegg has some fine ideas, David Davis liberalish moments, but Jack Straw has been uncharacteristically quiet, while David Cameron has gone back to boasting how he was part of Howard's Home Office gang, Mike and the Moronics. The liberal approach is unproven. But if we retreat into thinking we will solve crime by banging nasty people up without trying to reform them, the law will, alas, continue to look an ass. Blow me - wind farms don't work Giant wind turbines blighting large swaths of our countryside are not producing any energy, according to environmental consultant Michael Jefferson, because they have been plonked in areas where there is virtually no wind. Businessmen, it is claimed, stick them up to pocket lavish grants. And no one seems terribly cross because wind turbines are 'green' (even if their manufacture invariably requires more energy than they ever actually produce). Today Arthur Daley wouldn't flog motors with eight careful owners; he'd be offloading shares in our planet with several billion uncareful owners. For tycoons increasingly regard the green movement, which less worldly souls might not see as an entirely capitalistic enterprise, as just another way to make a fast euro. And that, I guess, is not always bad: if business makes money developing green energies, everyone gains. But some schemes are so un-green that I propose an annual ceremony called the Red-Faced Green awards, presented by Sienna 'Air Miles' Miller, sponsored by Virgin Atlantic. First, we learnt of rogue carbon-offset tycoons. Then of organic produce injected with more unhealthy substances than Amy Winehouse. Now wind farms that don't harvest any wind. And to think we told miners, reasonably, it seemed at the time, that we couldn't carry on paying them to mine where there was no coal... Miller's tale of callous hypocrisy On his otherwise sadly forgettable last album, John Lennon offered a good parting shot: 'You wanna save humanity. But it's people that you just can't stand.' We have all met, or heard, of characters like that: Victorian philanthropists lecturing the poor on profligacy; the Green party; Clare Short. And now, it seems, Arthur Miller. There was something rather perfect about the writer of Death of a Salesman, but the death of the playwright has uncovered a disturbing tale. He might have been that rare beast who could write brilliant plays while spending much of his life playing, notably with Marilyn Monroe, but now we are told that he packed his son Daniel off to an institution. He did so, Vanity Fair claims, because he didn't want his daughter Rebecca to live with a 'mongoloid'. Attitudes were different in 1966, when words like 'mongoloid' were used freely. But the detail that damns Miller is that he is said to have first met Daniel as an adult while making a speech to support a disabled man. Daniel, having grown up to play a full role in society, was attending as a member of a disability rights group and ran up to embrace the father he had never known. It is the hypocrisy, so obvious to the rest of us but not, apparently, to one of Miller's dazzling intelligence: how could he lecture society on its treatment of disabled people, having shown nothing but heartless indifference towards his disabled son? Lennon would recognise the type. Royal tribute This column is not always generous to royalty, taking the rather chippy view that there might be others in greater need of charity. This has been particularly so with Prince Harry, who has occasionally contrived to make Prince Andrew look like an homme serieux. But Friday's tribute to his mama was composed and just the right side of mawkish. At this rate there will be moves to skip a generation - for Harry. And with the young goosestepper in charge, our favourite family of Hanoverian immigrants could survive for a thousand years... Race talk A rather earnest German quizzed me recently on racism in Britain. I concluded it was still a problem, but that we have come a long way in 20 years. Then I opened the Sun and read the headline: 'Hitman suspect is \"Paki Mick\"' referring to the horrific murder of three men in Bishop's Stortford. It's extraordinary that casually insulting someone's nationality is still apparently just fine in the underworld."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
