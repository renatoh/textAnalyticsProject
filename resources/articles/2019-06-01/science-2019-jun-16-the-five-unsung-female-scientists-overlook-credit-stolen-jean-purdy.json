Attempts by one of the two men credited with the discovery, Prof Sir Robert Edwards, to include her name were rebuffed by the local health authorities. Edwards was later awarded a Nobel prize. Jocelyn Bell Burnell The British astrophysicist was a PhD student when she discovered repeating pulses of radio waves after studying months of radio telescope data. These became known as pulsars \u2013 spinning neutron stars which weigh more than the sun. Burnell\u2019s supervisor, Antony Hewish, was credited with the discovery and awarded a Nobel in 1974. Rosalind Franklin Jim Watson and Francis Crick are widely credited with discovering the structure of DNA. However Franklin\u2019s X-ray crystallography data was key to the duo\u2019s discovery. Whether they stole her data or merely used publicly available data without her permission is a moot point, but it is generally accepted that when Crick and Watson were awarded a Nobel in 1962, had Franklin been alive, she ought to have been included. Lise Meitner Along with Otto Hahn and Otto Robert Frisch, the Austrian-Swedish physicist was part of a trio who discovered the nuclear fission of uranium in 1939. This led to the development of nuclear weapons in the second world war, and later the generation of electricity from nuclear reactors. Meitner was nominated for a Nobel many times but it was Hahn who received the award in 1944. Alice Ball While at the University of Hawaii in the early 20th century, Ball worked on a treatment for leprosy (a big problem at the time in Hawaii). She died at the age of 24 and another chemist later took credit for her work \u2013 for several decades her treatment was known as the Dean method. Ball was the first woman and first African American to receive a master\u2019s at the university, and also its first female chemistry professor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
