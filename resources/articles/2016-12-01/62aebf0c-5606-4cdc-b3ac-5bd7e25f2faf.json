Rendered in slanted sans-serif capitals in red and blue against a white background, the governing body\u2019s title was now marked by three dramatic oblique slashes, as if inflicted by a duellist\u2019s sabre. Unfortunately, however, these wounds have proved to be neither merely symbolic nor superficial. Last week the organisation was informed by UK Sport that its Olympic funding had been withdrawn. Over the next four-year cycle, leading up to the Tokyo Games, it will receive not a penny to match the \u00a33.1m it received from the national lottery, via UK Sport, to prepare its campaign for Rio last summer. It had been caught with its guard down, and it was not alone. Where some sports had their funding raised and others saw it reduced by a relatively small percentage, fencing shared its bad news of zero funding with archery, badminton, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby. Zero funding amounts to official confirmation that your sport has no chance of producing a medal from the 2020 Games, or even in 2024. UK Sport\u2019s policy is to look at each discipline from an eight-year perspective, assessing the division of about half a billion pounds on the basis, as it put it, \u201cof the medals won, the number of medallists developed, and the quality of the systems and processes in place to find and support the nation\u2019s most promising future champions\u201d. Its support generally equates to between \u00a320,000 and \u00a360,000 per athlete per annum. For this, results are not just expected but demanded. Fencing demonstrably failed in Rio \u2013 but only narrowly. Richard Kruse, Britain\u2019s best exponent of the foil (which has a flexible rectangular-section blade, with points scored by hits to the opponent\u2019s torso), finished fourth in the men\u2019s individual event, losing to a Russian in the bronze medal match. He was also a member of the British quartet who finished sixth in the men\u2019s foil team event, losing in the quarter-final to the gold medal-winning Russians. But the really painful statistic is that Britain have taken only one gold medal in the Olympic fencing since the very first modern Games in 1896. That went to Gillian Sheen, a 28-year-old dental surgeon from London, in the foil in Melbourne in 1956. And there has been no British fencing medal of any colour in 52 years, since Bill Hoskyns took the individual silver in the men\u2019s \u00e9p\u00e9e (rigid triangular-section blade, hits scored on any part of the body) in Tokyo in 1964. Hoskyns now seems like a caricature of a British fencer. Brought up on an estate in Somerset, followed by Eton, where he took up the sport, and Oxford, from which he graduated with a fourth-class degree in agriculture, he took part in five summer Games. He competed with all three weapons \u2013 foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e and sabre (flexible triangular-section blade, hits on torso and mask) \u2013 displaying a left-handed style described as \u201cnonchalantly elegant\u201d. He even died with a blade in his hand \u2013 a pair of secateurs, in fact, while tending his orchard at the age of 82. His female counterpart would probably be Dame Mary Glen Haig, whose father had fenced at the 1908 Games and who competed in the first of her own four Games in London in 1948, where she finished eighth in the foil. Later she became a sports administrator, serving on the International Olympic Committee and the International Fencing Federation as well as supervising the first Women\u2019s Islamic Games in Tehran in 1993. The worst stain on Britain\u2019s Olympic fencing record is probably the participation of the landowner and baronet Cosmo Duff-Gordon in the silver medal-winning men\u2019s \u00e9p\u00e9e team at the 1906 Intercalated Games. Six years later he and 11 others \u2013 his wife, her secretary, two other first-class passengers and seven crew members \u2013 left the sinking Titanic in a lifeboat designed to hold 40, and were safely picked up three hours later. Duff-Gordon was said to have rewarded the crew by sending each of them a cheque for \u00a35. The scandal led to an inquiry, which ruled that suggestions of bribery were \u201cunfounded\u201d. In terms of honourable behaviour, the finest moment was undoubtedly contributed in 1932 by the 21-year-old Judy Guinness, a member of the Irish brewing family. Adjudged to have won the foil final in Los Angeles by a single point, she told the judges that they had failed to spot two hits by her opponent, Ellen Preis of Austria, and thus relinquished the gold medal. For that noble gesture alone, you might think, Britain\u2019s fencers deserve support for whatever Olympic ambitions they may possess. Almost 10,000 of them are members of British Fencing and about 25,000 more take part recreationally. There are about 400 fencing clubs in the UK and the governing body has a high-performance centre in Hendon, used by the athletes of the world-class programme \u2013 the men\u2019s foil and sabre teams. At the elite level, fencing in Britain has been struggling to make a belated transition from a sport run by enthusiastic amateurs to one capable of operating professionally. When the last chairman, David Teasdale, stood down this year, he described his four-year tenure as \u201ca period of unrest\u201d. He had taken over with a warning from UK Sport that there could be no public funding without an improvement in British Fencing\u2019s governance. Many changes were forced through as a result, including the arrival of independent directors, and Peter King, one of the principal architects of British Cycling\u2019s Olympic programme, lent a hand. Optimism was aroused in the buildup to Rio by bronze medals for the men\u2019s foils teams at the world junior championships in April and the European senior championships in June. None of it proved to be enough. Now the funding runs out on 1 April and Georgina Usher, British Fencing\u2019s chief executive since 2014 (and a 10-times British champion), told me that it has until 11 January to lodge an appeal against a decision she described as \u201cdevastating\u201d in the light of the modernisation efforts. It will be said that Britain did not come second in the Rio medal table \u2013 with 67 medals from 19 sports \u2013 by backing losers and that UK Sport\u2019s no-compromise policy recognises the need to justify the spending of public money. But it should be remembered that British Cycling, currently riding a boom with 130,000 members, had barely 20,000 less than a decade ago. And whoever dreamed that British gymnasts would one day be winning Olympic medals? Our fencers, who thought they had parried the worst, must now launch a swift and decisive riposte."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
