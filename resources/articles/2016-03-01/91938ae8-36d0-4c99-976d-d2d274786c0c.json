Over the past two weeks, the inquest into the death of Numan Haider in Melbourne has grappled with this question. The answer could change the way authorities engage with disaffected young people in trying to prevent similar attacks on police or the public. Victorian and federal police officers, and joint counter-terrorism unit officers who received intelligence on Haider, said they had no idea the 18-year-old posed an immediate risk to the safety of others. The only authority that held intelligence suggesting he posed a real threat to the public was Asio, coroner John Olle heard, but this information was either not obtained by Asio until after Haider\u2019s death or, in some instances, not passed on to joint counter-terrorism police who were investigating the teenager. Haider\u2019s father told the coroner that he and his wife were concerned about the new friends their son was hanging around with, frustrated by his refusal to answer their telephone calls while he was out with them, and perplexed that he had started praying at the controversial (and now closed) al-Furqan mosque, but they never believed he was capable of harming others. \u201cNuman was the happiest kid in the family,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe was healthy both physically and mentally. He did not drink or take drugs.\u201d To his family, some of his behaviour was typical of a frustrated teenager but was in no way indicative of a terrorism suspect planning an attack. The Haider family fled Afghanistan when Numan was seven, and lived in Victoria from the time he was nine. He held dual Australian-Afghan citizenship, and came from a loving family who valued the educational opportunities Australia provided. While his two older brothers studied hard and gained entrance to university, Haider was less focused, drifting between jobs and uninterested in tertiary study. He had previously been the sort of teenager who never questioned his parents, but was becoming less obedient as he got older, the coroner heard. He ignored his parents\u2019 pleas to stop associating with a much older friend named Ljindim Sulejmani who was on welfare and who attended the al-Furqan mosque. They believed Sulejmani\u2019s lack of ambition was a bad influence on their son, and could not understand why an older man wanted to associate with Haider. Haider also did not abide by their requests to stay at home more. What his parents did not know until the day of their son\u2019s death was the extent of the interactions law enforcement bodies, especially Asio, had with him. Haider had first come to the attention of authorities in June 2014. Officers were concerned by his attendance at the al-Furqan mosque and by the people he was associating with, and believed that he might be subject to radicalisation. His phone and movements were monitored by Asio from then on. His friendship circles had also changed around this time, and he broke up with his girlfriend. Less than four months later, on 24 September 2014, Haider would die. That day, police officers from the joint counter-terrorism unit arranged to meet him for a casual conversation at the Endeavour Hills police station about an incident at the Dandenong Plaza shopping centre on 18 September. At the plaza, Haider had waved a shahada flag at police officers and told them: \u201cI\u2019m not going to blow up the shopping centre today.\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against you personally, it is against your government and Australia.\u201d He told the police they would \u201cpay\u201d for counter-terrorism raids in Sydney and Brisbane earlier that day. Joint counter-terrorism officers wanted to find out more about what had provoked Haider\u2019s actions. When Haider pulled up in the car park outside the police station to meet them at 7.30pm, he rang one of the officers, requesting that the interview be conducted outside. Two police officers, identified only as officer A and officer B, walked into the car park to meet Haider, intending to search him and then bring him inside to talk to him. But they had no intention of arresting or interrogating him. Instead, in what the coroner heard was a relatively new approach to young terrorism suspects, police were simply trying to build rapport with him. CCTV footage from the station shows officer B running back into the police station less than a minute after walking outside with officer A to meet Haider, clutching his eye. A rapid sequence of events had unfolded. After introducing themselves and shaking Haider\u2019s hand, officer A asked Haider to empty his pockets. Haider produced a knife from his pocket, lunged at officer A and stabbed him in the arm. \u201cI have no doubt he was trying to kill me, and had I not blocked the knife with my arm, I would have been stabbed in the rib and stomach area,\u201d officer A told coroner Olle. \u201cI fell backwards on the carpark surface. Haider then continued past me, and got into contact with officer B.\u201d Officer B told the coroner: \u201cIn a split second, he was on me \u2026 I can\u2019t even say how he got to me. I didn\u2019t even have any audio perception of the incident, I just shut down. I just had no audio at all. It was kind of surreal. At the time he was on me, I didn\u2019t even know I was stabbed or slashed. \u201cMy eye was bleeding heavily and I felt blood running down my face. I did not feel any pain. I\u2019m sure that Haider would have cut my throat and cut my head off.\u201d But officer A climbed to his feet, drew his gun, and shot Haider in the head, killing him instantly. He remained in that position, gun pointing at Haider, while officer B ran back inside the station for help, and until paramedics arrived. He broke down as he recalled before the coroner the moment he was stabbed. Prof Greg Barton, a counter-terrorism expert at Monash University, was among those to give evidence at the inquest into Haider\u2019s death. He said Australian authorities had never before dealt with anything comparable. \u201cThat is, someone so young and radicalised so quickly, and to the point where they were prepared to use fairly substantial violence,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some youths who have been radicalised even more so since then. But the case of Haider was a watershed case, as it was the first where such a young person had been radicalised so quickly and to such violent end.\u201d Barton told the coroner that in the past it was thought that radicalisation took place slowly. The sort of radicalisation associated with groups such as al-Qaida, for example, involved the careful filtering of candidates followed by an intense and prolonged period of indoctrination. \u201cThis appears to differ greatly with Islamic State where the focus is on the rapid building of trust and persuasion to leave home to join with fighters in Syria and Iraq,\u201d Barton told the coroner. \u201cVery often travel appears to be paid for and facilitated by predatory recruiters in the networks and individuals can be moved in the space of a few months or possibly less, the point where they accept the offer of an air ticket.\u201d But Haider had been prevented from travelling overseas by Asio, who had cancelled his passport, an event that Haider\u2019s friends and family told the coroner had greatly upset him. He learned of the cancellation the day before his death, and responded by buying two knives. Two days before his death, the spiritual leader of Islamic State called for attacks against the Australian government and the public. \u201cIt appears being blocked from travel, which happened to coincide with the statement from [Islamic State], led to him quickly coming to a point where he decided that if he couldn\u2019t travel to the Middle East, he would act out an attack in Melbourne,\u201d Barton told the court. Barton tells Guardian Australia that although Haider was being monitored by authorities from June, his period of radicalisation occurred most rapidly and intensely in the fortnight before his death. What police had not known as they walked into the car park to meet Haider that evening was that Asio officers had found Facebook posts by Haider in the days before his death which included violent and crude remarks about police and intelligence officers. Intelligence that Haider had threatened to stab police officers with a knife during a phone call intercepted by Asio had also not been passed on to officers A and B, or other police from the counter-terrorism unit, the coroner heard. \u201cKnowing about the knife, it certainly would have given us more concern,\u201d officer B told the coroner. \u201cDifferent planning would have taken place. Instead of the two of us approaching him, four of us might have gone out with two staying back. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of options that could have been undertaken, and certainly a greater risk assessment in approaching him [would have been carried out].\u201d A senior leader in the joint counter-terrorism unit told the coroner in evidence given last week that he would never have allowed his team to approach Haider in the way they did had the information been known. According to Barton, the reasoning behind the police officers\u2019 decision to approach Haider \u2013 that is, to build a relationship with him rather than to interrogate him \u2013 was sound. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have all the information about the risk he posed, so they weren\u2019t in a position to assess their own personal risk fully. Their attitude would have been, \u2018Here is a kid, he had his passport rejected, we know he\u2019s angry about it, if we can get to him and build rapport, we can divert him from doing something more rash.\u2019 \u201cHad they realised how quickly Haider had been radicalised, not just over several months but over the previous week or so, they might have done things differently. But that\u2019s a pattern of radicalisation that they were not familiar with at the time.\u201d Analysis of Haider\u2019s phone after his death revealed that in the two days before his death, he had accessed violent Islamic State videos including executions, extremist Islamist propaganda and news articles about the former prime minister Tony Abbott including some that detailed Abbott\u2019s schedule. On Tuesday, an Asio officer had been scheduled to give evidence before Olle but instead, after out-of-court discussions between Asio, Victoria police and the Australian federal police, the inquest was adjourned until 27 April to give all parties time to gather more evidence. The evidence from joint counter-terrorism officers that they had not received crucial intelligence from Asio about Haider\u2019s behaviour is likely to be part of the reason for the adjournment. The inquest had been due to conclude this week. Counsel assisting, Rachel Ellyard, told the coroner that one of the most unfortunate aspects of Haider\u2019s death was the vulnerability of his case to oversimplication or stereotyping. \u201cEither the stereotype of excessive police violence or unfair targeting of Muslims, or the stereotype of dangerous young Muslim men posing a risk to Victorian society,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of Numan\u2019s death, both stereotypes could be seen in what was sometimes unfortunate media and public comment. Neither of those stereotypes is helpful. Neither assists your honour in your task.\u201d The inquest, she said, began from a much more open premise \u2013 that a young man had died, and that the circumstances of that death needed to be investigated and understood so that similar deaths could be avoided. But it appears likely to finish with Olle grappling with serious questions about the sharing of intelligence between law enforcement agencies and whether the way these agencies interact needs to change. Barton says ideally the inquest would have been held in the months immediately after Haider\u2019s death. Had it been held sooner witnesses, including Haider\u2019s friend Sulejmani, would not have been able to claim they could not remember important details, he says. In his evidence Sulejmani said he could not remember if he visited radical Islamic bookstores with Haider during a road trip they took together in Sydney in the weeks before his death. Sulejmani confirmed to the inquest that two other men, who were excused from giving evidence due to the risk of it jeopardising their own court cases, went on another road trip with Haider on the day of his death. A more timely inquest also would have prevented much of the unhelpful speculation from the media and others in the aftermath of Haider\u2019s death, Barton says. \u201cThe family of Haider and their immediate communities, including other Afghan and Muslim migrant families in south east Melbourne, were left asking, \u2018What happened? How could a kid who just seemed to be drifting suddenly be shot dead?\u2019 \u201cBut when you hear the facts of the case through an inquest, you understand why the police did what they did, and that his family were horrified by Haider\u2019s actions. If we\u2019d had this inquest within months, it may have helped with community relations, including the anger and suspicion.\u201d However, the coroner\u2019s job is to make recommendations that prevent a similar incident. Untangling what his friends knew about his radicalisation, the extent to which they were involved in that radicalisation, and their associations with known recruiters, is a job for the criminal courts. But it means his grieving family, grappling to comprehend what happened, are more likely to get the answers they seek from the courts than the coroner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
