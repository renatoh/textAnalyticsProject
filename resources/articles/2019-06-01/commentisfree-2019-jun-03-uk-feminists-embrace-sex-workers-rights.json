Freshly painted, the bright red casa is in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Constituci\u00f3n, in the heart of the red-light district. After today, it will be the new centre for Ammar \u2013 the Argentina\u2019s Women\u2019s Sex Workers\u2019 Union. On any one day, up to 200 women arrive \u2013 morning, noon and night \u2013 to find clients on the corners of the neighbourhood. Lilian, 55, has been a sex worker for 20 years. She stopped working, but has been forced to return to the streets of Constituci\u00f3n to make ends meet. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a total crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cWe used to work four to five hours a day. Now it\u2019s 12, including on Saturdays and Sundays, just to cover the basic necessities.\u201d Dramatic inflation (which reached nearly 50% last year), combined with a reduction in subsidies by the rightwing government under Mauricio Macri and at the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have sent the cost of basic foodstuffs, electricity and water spiralling. A third of the population are living in poverty. Women are disproportionately affected: almost 50% of women are either unemployed or working informally without labour protection or a security net, and cuts to public sector jobs have been most pernicious in feminised occupations. Despite the need to dramatically increase their income in the face of the rampant inflation, Georgina Orellano, general secretary of Ammar, says that \u201cworkers\u2019 wages haven\u2019t kept up, so we\u2019ve had to freeze our prices\u201d. To try to improve conditions for sex workers, Ammar opened the doors of the Casa Roja on 2 June, International Sex Worker Day. The centre will offer health and mental health services and a place to drink coffee as winter draws in. Importantly, says Valeria, an Ammar activist who works in Constituci\u00f3n, \u201cThere will also be legal assistance, so that the women know their rights.\u201d In the face of increasingly punitive policing in the area, such support will be invaluable. Ammar has been one of the most successful sex workers\u2019 organisations in the world. Across Argentina it has integrated itself into the mainstream labour movement, decriminalised sex work in some provinces, and provided peer-to-peer support for more than 20 years. But Macri\u2019s economic policies \u2013 including accepting the largest loan package ever issued by the IMF ($57.1bn) \u2013 have renewed Argentina\u2019s status as the most indebted country in Latin America. Conditions attached to the mammoth IMF loan threaten to roll back the gains that Ammar and other grassroots organisations have made since the last crisis of 2001. Argentinians, however, have never taken things sitting down. On 1 May the fifth general strike against \u201cMacrismo\u201d brought the capital city to a standstill. And women are in open revolt. Rebelling against interpersonal violence in their homes and on the streets, and the economic violence of structural adjustment, the NiUnaMenos (not one woman more) movement burst on to the scene in 2015. The campaign for legal, free and safe abortion has brought millions of women on to the streets, time and time again. Since integrating themselves into the labour movement, women in Ammar have also become increasingly visible in this effervescent feminist movement, taking the stage at women\u2019s assemblies, participating in the national women\u2019s meetings that attract tens of thousands of women from across the country, and building the Women\u2019s Strike which happened on 8 March. The parallels with the UK are striking. We too have been undergoing a massive programme of cuts for over a decade, with the burden falling disproportionately on the shoulders of women. Significant numbers of women have turned to sex work due to benefits sanctions and public sector wage freezes, and the precarious nature of sex work has increasingly come to characterise many of our contemporary experiences of work. Yet despite existing at the coalface of austerity, feminists in the UK have been slow to embrace sex workers as sisters in the struggle against gender and economic injustice. A small number of groups have stood shoulder to shoulder with sex workers, but the story has largely been one of violence and exclusion. Feminists who want to prohibit sex work have refused entry to sex workers to their conferences, leaving them standing in car parks in the rain; voted down motions in the TUC to make sex work safer; filmed sex workers without their consent and regularly denounced sex workers as \u201cpimps\u201d for trying to improve their working conditions. As the Argentinian experience shows us, sex workers have a privileged position from which to teach us about gendered violence and women\u2019s work. This is why the UK Women\u2019s Strike movement called for a \u201csex/work strike\u201d on 8 March \u2013 International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 placing sex workers centre stage at the heart of the day of action. The Women\u2019s Strike recognises that to create a strong and vibrant women\u2019s movement, economic justice must be prioritised, and sex workers must be at the heart of our struggles. As sex workers begin to unionise in their workplaces and as austerity cuts ever deeper feminists must get onboard with sex workers\u2019 rights. When sex workers speak, we must listen. \u2022 Kate Hardy is associate professor of work and employment relations at the University of Leeds \u2022 Ammar members used money from their own sex work to pay for expenses to set up the Casa Roja.
