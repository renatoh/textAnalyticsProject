In the May 3 local elections Labour is struggling in southern towns and cities which have helped deliver the party three election victories. Labour could also be virtually obliterated from another raft of southern councils, particularly in rural and suburban districts, according to Tony Travers, the local government expert at the London School of Economics. Gordon Brown, whose appeal to the south is already in doubt, may find that element of the New Labour coalition has disintegrated before he becomes prime minister. While the losses may be relatively small on each council, they could cause the party significant long-term damage, just as the Conservatives are finding it much harder to make gains in the north since they were excised from several city councils. \"The Labour party is beginning to suffer the same kind of tribal migration in the south of England. The difficulty is where the party dies out in local government it can't win any parliamentary seats,\" Mr Travers says. The weakness of its local organisation is evident in figures showing Labour is fielding candidates in only 60% of seats, with its presence least in the south-west (44%) and south-east (52%). Increasingly, Mr Travers argues, England is split, with the Liberal Democrats, albeit the weakest of the three major parties, the only national contender - they fight the Conservatives in the rural south and Labour in the urban north. Fifty years ago Labour and the Tories carved up 95% of the vote between them. Now not only the Lib Dems, but minority parties such as the Greens, Ukip and the BNP are fielding more candidates and are likely to make gains. Proportional representation for European elections has helped people to \"become slightly more promiscuous in their vote\", Mr Travers says. The Conservatives have no councillors in Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Liverpool; and none in Chesterfield, Easington, Gateshead, Knowsley, Wear Valley, York, Wansbeck, Bolsover, Durham and Derwentside and Cambridge. They also have no councillors in Oxford, which isn't electing this year, suggesting that they have a problem in university towns, where dissatisfaction reaps big gains for the Lib Dems. This time, the Pennine belt (West Yorkshire and East Lancashire) could be the area to watch for the spread of the \"Cameron effect\". The Tories must win some seats there. But last year they failed to achieve a net gain of council seats in Yorkshire. Labour's problem, though different by geography, could prove equally significant. It is already absent from several district councils in the west country and the Fens. This year it will be under pressure in places such as Castle Point - which went to Labour for one parliament in 1997 - where its only seat is up for re-election; and in Chelmsford and Guildford. In both Broxbourne and Daventry, Conservative-dominated councils, losing the one seat up for re-election would half Labour's representation. All three Labour's seat are up for re-election in Lib Dem Bournemouth, in Tory South Northants and hung Tewkesbury. Most of those can be written off by Labour as no longer natural territory. However, in Milton Keynes and Southampton, where Labour has won all or some of the seats in last three general elections, the party could be third on the council by May 4. Kent could be a critical battleground for Labour. Hung Dartford - where David Cameron launched the local election campaign last week - Dover and Maidstone are all Tory targets. Gravesham, where Labour has a narrow council majority, could go Conservative, just as the parliamentary seat did in 2005, though most of the council seats are solid for either party. Three Labour MPs won in 2005 with majorities of less than 300. Swale council, which includes Sittingbourne and Sheppey constituency, won by Derek Wyatt by just 79 votes, is Tory controlled and Labour could slip to third. Asked recently what Labour had to offer the south, Mr Brown said the party's appeal, there as elsewhere, remains the economy, though he offered a hint that the budget income tax cuts had precisely those voters in mind. Eric Pickles, the Tories' local government spokesman, resists, at least until election night, the opportunity to describe the local elections as a referendum on Mr Brown. All the parties are downplaying their chances now to claim great success later. The Conservatives will hail a triumph if they reap a few hundred gains, but Lord Rennard, the Lib Dems' elections guru, argues they have to do much better. He says the Tories will have to win 700 seats to do as well as last year, when they won more than 300 with far fewer up for election. In 2003, when most of these seats were last contested, the Tories won just 35% of the vote. On the eve of their last victorious general elections they were taking 45% (1979) and 46% (1992) , Lord Rennard says. The Lib Dems will work to hold Newcastle and Liverpool, win in Hull and become the largest party in Northampton. Gains from the Tories may be more elusive. There is a chance, albeit a slim one, that the Lib Dems will push Labour into third place in English local government. Figures released by the Tories show the Conservatives on 8,297 seats, Labour on 5,175 and the Lib Dems on 4,372. The Tories, who believe Labour are already down to their \"rock\" and regard talk of 600 losses as Blairite spin, dismiss that idea. Nonetheless, it would offer an altogether different kind of nightmare for Labour MPs, and one in particular, if it turned out to be true. At a glance Issues The main parties are campaigning on local council issues, but all accept they will be judged partly on broader national issues. Labour is emphasising its record on tackling crime and disorder in general and antisocial behaviour in particular. The Liberal Democrats are focusing on crime and the environment. The Conservatives are delivering a similar \"crime and grime\" attack, and repeating their Vote Blue, Go Green slogan from last year's elections. Expectations Labour can expect losses in the low hundreds, but it could be worse. The Conservatives will hope for big gains and the Lib Dems will hope to make more gains than losses. Share of vote could be the more telling factor. The Tories must hit 40%; Labour must not go below 25%; the Lib Dems will hope for 26% and upwards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
