Their first concert with Vladimir Ashkenazy - music director since 1998 - consisted of works by composers whose relationship to Czech culture is tangential: Mozart, who later in life found more acceptance in Prague than he did in Vienna, and Prokofiev, whose works form a response to the Soviet system that subsequently attempted to subsume Czechoslovakia into itself. Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, for all its popularity, is a problem piece. It was written in 1944 and the question of political relevance looms large over it. Prokofiev claimed the symphony depicted \"the grandeur of the human spirit\", and some have deemed it an attempt either to bypass or transcend contemporary events. In many respects, however, this ignores Prokofiev's flickering irony. \"The human spirit\" possessed anything but \"grandeur\" at the time. The symphony's tone is far from heroic, and much of its thematic material derives from rejected sections of other Prokofiev scores that depict tragic love stories - the ballet Romeo and Juliet, a soundtrack for a film of Pushkin's The Queen of Spades. Ashkenazy probes it cautiously in a performance that is strong on ambivalence, if not so hot on sheer clout. The relentless climaxes of the first movement hover between gaudy triumph and totalitarian heaviness. The scherzo is by turns elated and grotesque, its central section lurching from bucolic whimsy to graceless screeching. It is scrupulously played, if sometimes lacking the flamboyance usually associated with the Czech Philharmonic. Ashkenazy couples it with Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto, one of his darkest, most nerve-ridden scores. Eighteenth-century rationalism is conspicuously absent from the piece, which seethes with febrile tension and a twitchy sensibility. Ashkenazy directs it from the keyboard, locating its emotional core in the extravagant jolts of the second movement and pushing the whole towards high Romanticism. The opening allegro is curiously reflective when it could be wilder, though there are some wonderfully louring woodwind sonorities. Ashkenazy further stresses the concerto's Romantic links by playing the cadenza that Beethoven wrote for insertion into the first movement. It doesn't quite integrate into the whole - but that is Beethoven's responsibility rather than Ashkenazy's."}, "isHosted": false}}}
