The jumps season has been in full swing since April 30, just 24 hours after the old one finished, but for Nicholls, who cleared out his summer jumping stock this year, the campaign proper starts tomorrow with runners at Chepstow and Bangor where stable jockey Ruby Walsh could get the leg up on the promising Natal who looks the sort to really come into his own over fences this term. Nicholls, who hosted a press open day yesterday, warned Natal \"would not want it soft\" and if forced to switch him following yesterday's heavy rain has an alternative in mind in the Rising Stars Chase at Wincanton on November 4. That race is also a possibility for Denman, the horse that excites Nicholls most of his current crop. \"Denman will be ready in two or three weeks,\" revealed Nicholls. \"There is a race at Exeter on Haldon Gold Cup Day on October 31 which he could run in, or he may go for the Rising Stars. If you had seen him jump a fence you would know why we are excited and he was always going to be a better chaser.\" Boxing Day's King George VI Chase at Kempton, the most prestigious chase outside the Festival, is a race Nicholls is targeting with Star De Mohaison. \"He will probably start off in the Charlie Hall Chase (at Wetherby on October 28). He is still only a five-year-old and is a top-class prospect for this coming season.\" The King George is also being considered for Kauto Star, a faller when hot favourite for the Champion Chase at the Festival. He will run first in the Old Roan Chase at Aintree in two weeks time. \"He might be better over further than two miles. He was very sore after his fall at Cheltenham. We have given him plenty of time and schooled him recently and he jumped beautifully - he is ready to go.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
