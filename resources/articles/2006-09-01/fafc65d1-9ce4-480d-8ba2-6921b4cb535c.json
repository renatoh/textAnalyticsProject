But what is the income below which no child should live? In the absence of this figure, the government will continue to utter well-meaning platitudes but avoid taking appropriate action. It is shameful that a government so obsessed with targets still hasn't commissioned research to find out how much income is enough for decent lives, and then used such findings to set child-poverty abolition targets. International conventions proclaim the human right to an income adequate for decency and social participation, so no other measure will do. Professor John Veit-Wilson Newcastle University Collette Marshall is right to emphasise the depth of poverty of the 1 million children suffering the severest income inequalities here. In societies where income differences between rich and poor are smaller not only do the levels of educational attainment among schoolchildren tend to be higher but also community life is stronger and people are much more likely to trust each other. There is less violence - including substantially lower homicide rates - health is better and life expectancy is several years longer. Prison populations are smaller, birth rates among teenagers are lower. Meanwhile, in Britain, unaffordable housing, debt, chronic overcrowding and a complex benefits system massively increase the stress of inequality in poor families. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust Andrew Adonis proposes sending a few \"bright lads\" to posh schools; this is reminiscent of Victorian paternalism. Sure Start and similar schemes borrowed from the US may be of benefit to a few in the underclass, but most of the money ends in the pockets of salaried administrators and middle-class parents who are quick to take a hand-out. The original aim of socialists and trade unionists was to improve the lot of the working class by redistributing wealth and ending exploitation. It was not to place a third of the population on welfare while enabling a few to get educated and become successful members of the middle class. Governments such as those of Ch\u00e1vez and Castro, and even that of Attlee, which have made a genuine attempt to change a situation that keeps a third of the population in permanent poverty, are deplored by Blair and all conservatives. Education is a tool of government; and the present government has no intention of changing the system. L\u00e9o Burton Tr\u00e9darzec, France Child poverty may be an \"abstruse issue\" to \"an implacable moderniser\" such as Chris Bryant MP (The only way to win again, September 26) but it is certainly not remote from the apprehension of the millions of children and parents whose daily lives are blighted by it. These people are potential voters too and their votes should not be taken for granted. The prioritisation of the eradication of child poverty might also unite the Labour party and help it win again. Ruth Lister Professor of social policy, Loughborough University A pity that Cherie's outburst overshadowed John Hutton's speech on welfare reform. He made the point that work is the best route out of poverty, yet acknowledged that some 40% of two-parent families with one parent working full time remain in poverty. Research has indicated that at least 55% of families with disabled children are living in, or at the margins of, poverty. Further, it is estimated that on average it costs three times as much to bring up a disabled child as a non-disabled child. The solution is straightforward: social-security benefits and tax credits need to be increased to adequate levels for families with disabled children. Until this happens, simply moving disabled people into work will fail to address the in-work poverty affecting many Britons.
