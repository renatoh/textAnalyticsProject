The Department of Education will consider the results of its market research amid considerable uncertainty over the fate of the government\u2019s plans to deregulate university fees and cut course subsidies. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, is yet to secure adequate crossbench support to pass his legislation before the Senate rises at the end of next week for the Christmas break \u2013 but remains in negotiations in an attempt to salvage a compromise. His department has disclosed its contract with a company that specialises in communications and marketing including \u201cresearch to support awareness-based communications strategy and campaigns\u201d. The $149,810 contract with Orima Research is for \u201cmarket research on the level of awareness and understanding of the higher education system\u201d, according to details posted on the AusTender website. The research contract, procured by open tender, covers an eight-week period expiring this Sunday. A spokeswoman for the department told Guardian Australia the aim was to find out whether the public understood the status of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (Hecs, also known as Help), the program allowing Australian graduates to defer paying any of their tuition fees until they are earning a decent income. She said the market research was commissioned after the department attended 45 tertiary studies and careers exhibitions and university open day events between July and September. \u201cThe purpose of attending these events was to provide students with information about Australian government assistance for tertiary study, and the proposed higher education reforms announced in the 2014-15 budget,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cFeedback from attendees at these events indicated that there was a consistent lack of understanding of Australia\u2019s current higher education system, in particular the status of Hecs. \u201cOn this basis, the department engaged a specialist research organisation to examine the extent to which this feedback reflected broader views and understanding of the higher education system.\u201d Pyne would not rule out an advertising campaign on Friday. \u201cThe government will consider the findings of the department\u2019s research, which is seeking to establish the level of understanding about the higher education funding system and how it works,\u201d the minister\u2019s office said. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said it would be \u201can absolute disgrace\u201d if the government proceeded with an advertising campaign. \u201cNo amount of spin or paid advertising will convince Australians that Tony Abbott\u2019s plans for $100,000 university degrees are a good idea,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cTony Abbott wouldn\u2019t have to waste money on market research if he just spoke to a few people about his higher education cuts \u2013 I can guarantee you he\u2019d get a few honest opinions.\u201d Labor, the Greens and unions have spent months campaigning against the Coalition\u2019s higher education changes, arguing they would result in high fees and an elitist system in which people are forced to choose between university or buying a house. Pyne has previously sought to allay these concerns by saying students would \u201cnot have to pay a dollar upfront for their course\u201d because they would continue to have access to Hecs and not repay it until they were earning more than $50,000 a year. Departmental officials told a Senate estimates committee they were concerned that prospective students were confused because of \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the changes. Students were asking at university expos whether Hecs was \u201cgone\u201d, but any decision on launching an \u201cinformation\u201d campaign would be a matter for the government, the officials said. The government wants to pass its legislation by the end of next week, citing the need to avoid uncertainty for the university sector and students. Even though the majority of the changes are not due to take effect until 2016, school graduates considering enrolling next year do not know what fees they will pay in their second year of study. If the public statements of crossbench senators are a guide, the government is unlikely to be able to pass its bill next week. The bill would remove caps on university fees, cut the average course subsidy by 20%, and extend funding to sub-bachelor programs and private colleges. The university sector and the crossbench is firmly opposed to higher interest rates on Hecs loans, but Pyne has repeatedly signalled his willingness to compromise on this part of the package in an attempt to win Senate backing for other measures. Abandoning the interest rate proposal would knock more than $3bn of budgeted savings over four years. Labor and the Greens firmly oppose the whole package, so the government needs support from six of eight crossbench senators to pass it. This means the bill will be blocked if three or more crossbench senators oppose the bill. The newly independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who met with Pyne this week, said she \u201ctold him bluntly \u2018no deal\u2019 \u2013 take your plan to the people at the next federal election and stop using cuts to uni funding like a gun to the head\u201d. The Palmer United party \u2013 represented by senators Glenn Lazarus and Dio Wang \u2013 maintains its position of opposing the bill. Lazarus said on Thursday that the party would not entertain any increase in university fees. The independent senators Nick Xenophon and John Madigan, who often work closely together, have expressed serious concerns about the bill\u2019s impacts while remaining open to talks with the government on finding a compromise. Xenophon has signalled his preference for talks to continue into the new year rather than a rushed deal being done next week, but Madigan said students and universities required certainty. Madigan has issued the government with five non-negotiable conditions for his support, including the dumping of higher interest rates, creation of a regional assistance fund, and supervision of fees. He said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency should \u201cact as an oversight body for course fees\u201d. The Liberal Democratic senator David Leyonhjelm and the Family First senator Bob Day are broadly supportive of the government\u2019s bill, although Day\u2019s vote depends on the scrapping of student loan interest rate changes. The Australian Motoring Enthusiast party senator Ricky Muir could not be reached for comment on Friday, but has previously expressed his concerns about the bill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
