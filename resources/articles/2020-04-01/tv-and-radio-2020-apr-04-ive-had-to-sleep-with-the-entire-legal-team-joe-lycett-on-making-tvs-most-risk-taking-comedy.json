Sort of. \u201cActually, whilst I\u2019m glad you brought it up, in my defence it wasn\u2019t me. It was the other Hugo Boss.\u201d This is a confusing time for the identity of the Birmingham-born comedian formerly known as Joe Lycett. As we meet during a break in filming for series two of Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back \u2013 his Channel 4 show that\u2019s like a comic take on Watchdog \u2013 it is now one week since he changed his name to Hugo Boss by deed poll. The intention: a stunt to protest against the fashion brand, which has been accused of aggressively pursuing small companies and charities who use the word \u201cBoss\u201d in their name. The execution: using his new name to wind up the couture company in gloriously silly manner. \u201cI will now make a number of statements which I REALLY hope do not get confused with the opinions of @HUGOBOSS,\u201d tweeted the comic. \u201cJust to clarify, these are the statements of Hugo Boss, not of Hugo Boss. Hugo Boss microwaves fish in the office. Hugo Boss always asks: \u2018What percentage are you on?\u2019 before he lets you borrow his charger. Hugo Boss has a smelly bum bum.\u201d But what started as one of the campaigns in the upcoming show has caused all sorts of difficulties. After all, what does he now do with the name of a programme whose first season was called Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back? Completely change the whole thing? Or rename just one episode, risking it being incorrectly billed in the press? \u201cPresumably I\u2019ll have to find a way of changing my name between episodes,\u201d shrugs the comedian. \u201cThe logistics of it are a nightmare.\u201d On top of that, his manager has registered a desire for him to return to his previous name \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and the DVLA has refused to issue him a new driving licence, as it had some concerns about the calligraphy of his new signature. \u201cIt\u2019s a cock and balls, so they said it could be deemed as offensive,\u201d he laughs. It has, however, done his profile no harm, generating some of the biggest headlines of Lycett\u2019s \u2013 sorry, Boss\u2019s \u2013 career. This is no mean feat given that he is not short of high-profile gigs: his easy presence and eye for a wry quip has also seen him replace Claudia Winkleman as host of BBC\u2019s The Great British Sewing Bee. And he has taken over from Richard Ayoade as the anchor of Channel 4\u2019s Travel Man. As well as filming season two of his consumer-affairs show. \u201cThings are very busy,\u201d he sighs in mock exasperation. But the thing that The Comedian Formerly Known As Joe Lycett is primarily known for is a flair for daft schemes that pit him against institutions. In 2015, he went viral after an 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown appearance in which he recounted a battle with York Council over a parking ticket. Nearly 4 million YouTube users to date have viewed his account of how he successfully evaded the fine by badly Photoshopping the words \u201cthe moon\u201d on to a photo of his car and claiming that he was parked in outer space at the time of the offence. Last year, he made headlines by getting the terrifically named Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Yvonne Mosquito, to come to his house and officially open his kitchen extension. And, in the early days of his career, he took Jim Davidson to task after he heard him use a racist term for a Chinese person during a set while they were sharing a bill. \u201cNext time we shared a bill, he got to that bit, turned to look at me \u2026 and didn\u2019t say it. I had an amazing moment where I was like: \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve censored Jim Davidson!\u2019\u201d So it was only a matter of time before his love of campaigning made it to television. Series one of Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back managed to set up hilarious pranks and brilliantly weird celebrity interventions, then team them with astonishing revelations into the poor practices of big companies. Uber Eats had to improve its policy concerning eateries\u2019 food hygiene after Boss n\u00e9 Lycett successfully set up a dirty skip as a restaurant on the app. When a viewer complained they had lost \u00a38,000 to a scammer who had somehow got access to intimate details of their NatWest account, the comedian flashmobbed its parent company RBS until it refunded the money. It is a format that manages to be funny while also punching up at the establishment, even if it has caused headaches for Channel 4\u2019s lawyers. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sleep with the entire legal team,\u201d laughs Lycett/Boss. \u201cGenuinely, no one\u2019s made a show quite like this before and lots of it is quite hard to get legally right. There are loads of things I want to do that they have to stop me from [doing]. Last series, I wanted to steal a car to show how easy it is to nick new ones that don\u2019t have physical keys. And they went: \u2018No, we can\u2019t do that because that\u2019s just committing crime.\u2019\u201d Traversing this legal minefield seems to have paid off, though. Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back has captured the public\u2019s imagination to the point where they now approach him in the street asking for help with weirdly specific problems. (\u201cThings like: \u2018The lip of the kettle I bought doesn\u2019t work properly, what can I do?\u2019\u201d). There is something genuinely impressive about his show\u2019s commitment to taking companies to task. Lycett insists that they are obsessive about \u201cjournalistic rigour\u201d in pursuing corporations over their poor practices. It is hard to imagine this will not still feel relevant while the nation is on lockdown: even in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, some of the stories to really capture public attention are tales of corporate wrongdoing. Twitter is awash with people railing against Mike Ashley\u2019s suggestion that the nation cannot function without knock-off leggings. The employment practices of Wetherspoons owner Tim Martin are all over the #COVIDIOTS hashtag. And the internet cannot stop pointing out that the wage bill of Virgin Atlantic staff is the kind of money Richard Branson accidentally drops between sofa cushions \u2013 so his request for them to take unpaid leave seems, well, a bit rich. So, if anything, coronavirus might have made this show even more urgent. There is a quip that really sticks in the mind in the days after our interview, one that was made weeks before the full devastation that Covid-19 might make to society became clear but that has nonetheless proven eerily prescient. \u201cI did say half-jokingly when we launched that I wanted to destroy capitalism with this programme. Give us one more series and capitalism will probably have destroyed itself by then. We\u2019ll just be doing the clearing up.\u201d Maybe. But Boss/Lycett\u2019s wry take on holding power to account will still be joyous to watch. Five mischievous moments Recording Bastards Harry Hill! Noel Fielding! Paul Chuckle! Lycett and his comedic \u201cfriends\u201d cram the word \u201cbastards\u201d into John Lennon\u2019s Imagine 17 times in 90 seconds for a gleeful Instagram satire of Gal Gadot\u2019s celeb-packed performance. Altogether now: \u201cImagine all the bastards, living life like a baaasstaaarddddd!\u201d Changing his name to Hugo Boss At the peak of the hype around Lycett\u2019s taking on of Hugo Boss by adopting their name, one article claimed that the comic \u201cstands to make \u00a31.5m\u201d from the name change. Since then, a Welsh brewery threatened with legal action by the fashion giant has won a marketing award for being \u201cbrave\u201d. And, given that Lycett has also trademarked a yet-to-be-released product called \u201cBoss La Cease en Desiste\u201d, this stunt looks set to get even better. Creating a fake hotel for Pat Sharp How to point out that a hotel chain\u2019s rooms are so thoroughly grim that even former Fun House host Pat Sharp has complained about them? Cheekily redecorate one of their rooms in the style of a cosy Alpine ski lodge to lampoon the CEO\u2019s non-dom status in Austria for tax reasons. Then launch it as a boutique hotel, obviously. The first guest Lycett convinced to stay the night? Pat Sharp. Getting Birmingham\u2019s Lord Mayor to open his kitchen extension \u201cJoe, this is the first kitchen extension I\u2019ve ever opened\u201d: so speaketh the Lord Mayor of Birmingham upon cutting the ribbon on the room in which Lycett does his microwaving. After Yvonne Mosquito\u2019s initial refusal due to it being a \u201cprivate event\u201d, Lycett convinced her by raffling tickets on Twitter and dubbing Radio 1 its \u201cexclusive broadcast partner\u201d. Exhibiting a multimillion-pound artwork at the Royal Academy The value of a wonky clay face you\u2019ve drunkenly moulded around a Pringles tube? Clearly more than the Royal Academy expected, judging by the email it sent Lycett to check that his submission to their summer show was correctly valued at \u00a310.5m. \u201cGosh!\u201d he replied, \u201cit should be \u00a312.5m!\u201d How strange that when the piece made it into the exhibition it didn\u2019t get its own plinth. Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back begins Friday 10 April, 8pm, Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
