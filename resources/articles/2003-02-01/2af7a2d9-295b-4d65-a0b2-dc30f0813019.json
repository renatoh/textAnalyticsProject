The Grand Prix went to R\u00e9gis Loisel (b.1954), author of a series of graphic novels loosely based on Peter Pan (and featuring a rather buxom Tinkerbell). Loisel, who lives in Montreal and regards drawing as \"un jeu expressif\", worked with the Disney studios on Mulan and Atlantis and plans to release a video game. Previous winners include Robert Crumb and Albert Uderzo, who draws the Asterix books. Another category is the Prix Alph-Art, named after an unfinished work by Herg\u00e9. The Prix Alph-Art for best graphic novel went to Chris Ware for his Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth. Jimmy Corrigan won the Guardian First Book Award in 2001. \u00b7 The beautiful medieval town of Sighisoara in Romania has been spared the indignity of a Dracula theme park complete with 700-bed hotel, souvenir shops, nightclubs and beer halls, plus an estimated 30,000 visitors a day. It now looks as if the monstrous park will be built in Bucharest. Sighisoara is listed as a World Heritage site, but also happens to be the birthplace of the 15th-century Count Vlad Tepes (the Impaler), whose bloodthirsty exploits inspired Bram Stoker to name his character Dracula. Vlad was fondly known as \"Dracul\" (the Devil) and used to sign himself \"Draculea\" or \"Draculya\" (the Devil's son). However, Stoker's Dracula is not Vlad the Impaler, but a Transylvanian count living in a mysterious castle to which he lures his victims. Stoker never visited Transylvania and is vague about Dracula's address, but it would seem to be nowhere near Sighisoara, or Bucharest. \u00b7 One of the internet's treasures must surely be the Invisible Library. Jorge Luis Borges once imagined an infinite library containing all the books ever written, but the Invisible Library is dedicated to books that have never existed. Only here will you find Ts'ui Pen's The Garden of Forking Paths or Pierre Menard's Don Quixote (both mentioned by Borges in his fiction). You will also find Mr Pickwick's Speculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds, with Some Observations on the Theory of Tittlebats; Sherlock Holmes's Practical Book of Bee Culture; Richard Tull's Dreams Don't Mean Anything (from The Information); and even Marcus Chalfen's Chimeric Mice: An Evaluation and Practical Exploration of the Work of Binster (1974) Concerning the Embryonic Fusion of Mouse Strains at the Eight-Cell Stage of Development (from White Teeth). JK Rowling has added considerably to the catalogue as have Terry Pratchett, AS Byatt, Umberto Eco and Douglas Adams (Oolon Colluphid's Where God Went Wrong and Who is This God Person Anyway?). The Invisible Library remains far from complete and new suggestions are welcome at invisiblelibrary.com. \u00b7 In recognition of Claire Tomalin winning the Whitbread Book of the Year with Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self, we thought it might be nice to see what Pepys was doing on this day in 1667. After a morning in the office and lunch at home, Pepys set off through the mist and rain to Deptford to see his mistress, Mrs Bagwell. Our diarist then resorts to foreign words to relate what followed: \"And did sensa alguna difficulty monter los degres and lie, comme jo desired it, upon lo lectum; and there I did la cosa con much voluptas.\" Soon afterwards, Mr Bagwell, a ship's carpenter, walked in, \"and there, without any notice taken by him,\" Pepys reports, \"we discoursed of our business of getting him the new ship building by Mr Deane, which I shall do for him\".
