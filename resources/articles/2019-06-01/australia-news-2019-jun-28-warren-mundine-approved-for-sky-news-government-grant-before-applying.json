Mundine, a former president of the Australian Labor Party who became Scott Morrison\u2019s pick for the seat of Gilmore at the 2019 federal election, had hosted two seasons of a Sky News TV series showcasing Indigenous businesses called Mundine Means Business. The government was criticised in early 2019 when it was revealed that the show had been funded in part by the federal government as part of its Indigenous Advancement Strategy. The two series were funded, in part, by two contributions from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to Mundine\u2019s business, Nyungga Black Group, totalling just over $300,000. The first was part of a consultancy services package in 2017. The latter grant, worth $200,000, was awarded in mid-2018. The $200,000 made up 15% of total production costs for the show, according to the department. The second grant was awarded several months before Mundine became a Liberal candidate. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under Freedom of Information law reveal Mundine approached Nigel Scullion, then minister for indigenous affairs, directly for funding for the second season. On 26 March, a staff member in Scullion\u2019s office told department assistant secretaries Clare Sharp and Kirsti McQueen that Mundine \u201chas approached the minister seeking another seasons\u2019 worth of sponsorship (around $200K) for his TV show.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cCould you please get a brief up to us ASAP?\u201d An email dated 3 April 2018 from a staff member in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet shows the department seeking to brief Scullion\u2019s office \u201cas soon as possible\u201d about funding for the second season. On 12 April, Elizabeth Henderson, chair advisory board for Nyungga Black Group, sent the department a costing brief on the proposed second season, which would consist of up to 24 episodes. Mundine submitted the grant application on 31 May2018, but according to the grants website, the tender was approved on 11 May. A spokesperson for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet told Guardian Australia that this was \u201cstandard practice\u201d. \u201cThe former Minister for Indigenous Affairs approved a direct approach to Nyungga Black Group on 11 May 2018, believing the organisation was best placed to deliver the services required,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThey were then invited to submit an Indigenous Advancement Strategy grant application, which was submitted on 31 May 2018. This is standard practice for a direct approach.\u201d The government\u2019s contribution was more than $200,000, but the full expected cost of the program was redacted from the documents released. Guardian Australia has appealed against the decision to withhold this information. Ultimately, 16 episodes were produced, ending last September. The grant had been set to run until August 2019, but in March, the grant period was modified to have ended at the end of January. The spokesperson said that Mundine had requested the date be brought forward. \u201cThe project (activity) end date was amended to 31 January to reflect that all milestones had been delivered before that date,\u201d the spokesperson said. Mundine told Guardian Australia that the grant was not awarded prior to the submission of the application, and said the original end date was how long the grant allowed for the project to be delivered, but it was finalised in 2018. \u201cThe contract provided by the department nominated a term for the grant,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially that was the maximum amount of time we had to complete the season and the deliverables. We produced a 16 episode season that concluded in late 2018. Since the season had concluded and the grant deliverables had been completed there was no need for the grant term to continue.\u201d In a Senate estimates hearing in February this year, Labor senator Jenny McAllister questioned Scullion why Mundine had received the funding. \u201cWhat has actually taken place is that a person who was known to be very close to the Prime Minister, who is sitting on the Prime Minister\u2019s Indigenous Advisory Council, receives a direct grant which no other person was able to apply for to develop a television program to raise his profile, and then that person nominates as a candidate for the Liberal Party,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you see why people might find that just a little bit unacceptable in terms of use of public money?\u201d \u201cNo, I can\u2019t at all,\u201d Scullion replied. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a point about him being on the Indigenous Advisory Council, it\u2019s not because he was close to the Prime Minister. It is because he is a high-profile, very articulate, very smart Aboriginal man providing leadership in this area. I don\u2019t think anyone would deny that.\u201d Scullion said that the reason the show\u2019s funding had become a topic of discussion was because Mundine had become a member of the Liberal Party after the show aired."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
