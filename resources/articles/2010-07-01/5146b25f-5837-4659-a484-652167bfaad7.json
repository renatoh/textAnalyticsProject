Steven Finn, after all, lives just a couple of streets away, in his flat in Abbots Langley, in this little corner of Hertfordshire where he also went to school a few years ago. The 21-year-old, who has made a startling breakthrough into the England side this year, rocks back in his chair and smiles as he thinks of all those sunlit afternoons he spent as a schoolboy playing, watching and dreaming of cricket. \"I remember days like this in 2005,\" he says, conjuring up vivid images of that unforgettable Ashes summer against Australia, \"and how, at Parmiter's [School], we'd get out of lessons early so we could watch the cricket on television. The Tests were on Channel 4 then and so the school set up all these TVs. By the time I got back home I'd pretend to be Andrew Flintoff or Steve Harmison. And because he's my hero, and I've always had a vision of myself aiming to emulate him as an attritional bowler, I just loved watching Glenn McGrath.\" Finn leans forward thoughtfully as he considers the great Australian with a reverence that is now framed by a more analytical understanding of the unremitting accuracy and seemingly unbreakable mentality that defined McGrath. His gaze settles on the ramshackle cricket net that can be unfolded and erected along one strip of our garden. As the holidays are about to begin and a small boy inside our house is secretly dreaming he might grow up to bowl a bit like Finn himself, while his sisters sigh and roll their eyes at the absurdity of it all, the net seems to glisten in the sunshine. \"You know,\" Finn says, \"I would spend hours in a net like that, trying to bowl like McGrath, or copy his mannerisms. That's where my love of cricket started, dreaming of bowling like McGrath or Flintoff. And that's why, now, it seems bizarre I'm actually that person on TV when I'm playing for England. Your mind can start racing then and you can get ahead of yourself. But that's why it's important to remain realistic. I've only played four Tests against Bangladesh and, although I've got some wickets, I know how much I've got to learn. I've got some big challenges ahead \u2013 whether it's to try and stay in the Test team for the series against Pakistan or to get stronger in my body. I've been thinking a lot about how much better I can get if I work hard and stay level-headed.\" Finn's cool realism underpins a deeper intensity to improve as a cricketer. This balanced combination shapes a character that is as impressive as the purity of his bowling action \u2013 which has had former Test cricketers almost drooling at the prospect of watching Finn continue his progress against Pakistan, with that series starting at Trent Bridge on Thursday. Yet, even at his most relaxed, Finn is resolute in refusing to look too far ahead, especially with an Ashes tour looming so enticingly at the end of the year. At least he allows himself to relish the moment he discovered he was about to join England's Test party in Bangladesh earlier this year. \"I was deeply shocked because I thought other bowlers were ahead of me in the pecking order,\" he says. \"My phone rang and it was my mum. I'd just picked it up when the other phone started ringing. It was Hugh Morris [the managing director of England cricket], but I've got Mum in my other ear saying, 'Hugh Morris wants to talk to you \u2013 pick up your phone you idiot!' \"Hugh said, 'Congratulations, you've been picked for England. Pack your stuff, you're leaving in 24 hours.' It was one of the most euphoric feelings I'd ever had. I was thinking, 'Christ, what do I do now?' And then I thought I'd better phone Mum back.\" Finn's good sense kicked in, ensuring he worked out how he might make the most of his unexpected opportunity. \"I thought I'd be going out as a net bowler. I never dreamt I'd be making my Test debut. So I was determined to soak up any tips or advice I could pick up from the best players in the country.\" England's bowling resources in Bangladesh, however, were depleted by injury and by the absence of the rested Jimmy Anderson. The day after he arrived in Bangladesh, Finn was picked for a warm-up game that immediately revealed his character. \"With the jet lag and the humidity I was knackered after my first four overs. But it was a barrier I wanted to push through. I wanted to bowl and bowl, and when I came off my whole body was cramping. I had four blokes stretching me out on the physio's bed. If I moved in one direction everything else would cramp. It was extreme pain. But it was also satisfying because I knew I'd given everything to my bowling.\" Andy Flower, England's coach, who had been monitoring Finn's performances for Middlesex the previous season, had seen enough. He decided England should pick a raw talent because, with his height and fluid action, Finn has the attributes to become a lethal Test bowler. \"I was pretty nervous the night before,\" Finn says, before correcting himself with a laugh. \"Actually, I was goddamn nervous because it was my Test debut. \"You try to approach it with no inhibitions, but it's very difficult. It's something that, even if it's sub-consciously, you've built up to your whole life. So I struggled to sleep that night. It didn't start too brightly when I finally got to bowl. After three overs I'd gone for 25 runs. There were alarm bells ringing somewhere deep inside me. I was thinking, 'Am I good enough to be here? This is the weakest Test match nation and you've just been smacked for 25 runs.' \"But cricket is a fickle game. That's why it's such a beautiful game, really, because of its ebbs and flows. In those testing moments you need to keep your head clear \u2013 just like you should never get carried away when you're having success. I came back for two overs at the end of the afternoon and they only scored a couple off the one while the other was my first Test maiden. That gave me confidence and I kept my place for the next Test and for the two we played in England.\" Against Bangladesh at Lords, in late May, Finn took four for 100 in the first innings and then completed a five\u2011wicket haul on the last day. Finn was named man of the match and his name was inscribed on the honours board. The plaudits rolled in and hopes grew that England might have found their own version of McGrath \u2013 with few commentators knowing that the extent to which Finn admires the Australian means he is scandalised by such a premature comparison. Strikingly, especially as he took five for 42 in the second Test at Old Trafford, Finn is circumspect. \"I was disappointed with the way I bowled in the Tests,\" he says. \"I feel I let myself down. Even though I got wickets, I didn't feel the ball was coming out of my hand the way it should. \"Getting that five-for at Lords was one of the best feelings I've ever had, but I'm hard on myself. I've got five for 87 on the board, but I'm gutted there are 87 runs next to my name. I wish it was 47. So there are massive areas of my bowling that need improving.\" England have had the foresight to place Finn on a strengthening programme over the past six weeks. There is a determination to bolster a fragile physique that might otherwise have broken down. The fact Graham Onions, a star last summer, has been injured for the whole year is a reminder that Finn needs to look after himself as much physically as he already does with his methodical mental preparations. \"I know if I become stronger I'll bowl quicker and, most importantly, more consistently,\" he says. \"So it's been important for me to become more 'body aware'. I also spent time with the England one-day squad during the series against Australia, and I did lots of bowling in the nets. I loved that.\" There have been suggestions that, in leaving him out of their one-day team, England were \"hiding\" Finn from the Australians \u2013 and that he will be unleashed in the heat of Ashes. All the talk prompted Michael Clarke, the Australia vice-captain, to insist he and his fellow batsmen had seen plenty of Finn in the nets this summer. He also said, typically, that Australia had already made detailed \"plans\" for Finn. \"It's a confidence booster when they're talking about you,\" Finn says. \"But I've got a lot to do to prove I deserve to be on that plane to Australia. So I'm doing my best not to think about it and just play well .\" To divert him, we start talking about writing. Alongside his girlfriend Lucy, of course, Finn describes writing as his main interest outside cricket. \"I really enjoy it and, when I was younger, I found it much easier to get the thoughts in my head down on paper,\" he says. \"If the cricket didn't work out I'd look to do something on the writing side. A journalism degree would benefit me more than something like sports science. I even did a two-day journalism taster and went up to Trent Bridge to work with an editor. I ended up writing an article about Glenn McGrath and why he's my idol. I took great pride in writing it and I was chuffed when it got used, almost word for word, as I'd written it.\" The shadows have begun to lengthen, but Finn is worked hard again, during a photo session. He is repeatedly told to smile, but he reminds our Scottish photographer that fast bowlers are meant to look mean and moody. \"Christ,\" Finn says when he finally sees a couple of images, \"I look like an angel.\" He is joking, of course, but there is an even warmer seriousness when the real business of the afternoon begins. We move over to the net. Finn looks at my son, one bowler to another, and offers to have a bat. A hush settles across the garden and, at least in one small boy's mind, we've been transported to the Gabba, in Brisbane, and the first Ashes Test. Having absorbed all our repeated references to McGrath the first ball is pitched on the off-stump and Finn plays a solid defensive shot. \"Good ball, Jack,\" he shouts to my son before telling me that, last weekend, he actually played a rare match for his club, West Herts. \"I scored 53,\" he grins. Finn takes guard and awaits the next delivery. This time, with the grass baked hard after an unusually hot summer, the ball rears off a good length and cracks Finn on the knuckles. He drops the bat, yelps \"That hurts!\" and wrings his bowling hand in discomfort. Suddenly, England's plans for the summer and the Ashes beyond look under threat \u2013 potentially ruined by a nine-year\u2011old boy and a worn garden pitch. \"At least the photographer's gone,\" Finn says, laughing, as he blows on his fingers. But, rather than ending his net then, he shouts out further encouragement to his fan, who, under the willow tree at the start of his run\u2011up, is already planning on bowling him with his next ball. It doesn't happen; Finn loses neither his wicket nor his relish for an impromptu game of garden cricket. He expresses delight at, in his words, \"that spitting delivery\" \u2013 and it is easy then to imagine a natural fast bowler like Finn continuing to develop and improve and, just maybe, turning the Gabba and four other cricket grounds across Australia into his own garden kingdom. \"Yeah, wouldn't that be cool,\" he says. \"And, who knows, maybe I'll even get to meet Glenn McGrath.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
