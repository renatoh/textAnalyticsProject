Well, I think I have\u2019", "bodyText": "The book I am currently reading The Barbara Kingsolver novel Unsheltered. Not quite up there with The Poisonwood Bible and Flight Behaviour, but still a magnificent novel. The book that changed my life Nobel prize-winning Australian novelist Patrick White\u2019s Voss. It is a sweeping and eccentric book, a modernist classic (Thomas Mann eat your heart out), and it showed me that Australians were just as entitled to write novels as anyone. The book I wish I\u2019d written James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses will do me. The book that had the greatest influence on me The poetry of WB Yeats. I use him shamelessly to fill up my prose storage tanks. He\u2019s illimitable. The book that is most underrated The Inheritors by William Golding and Anthony Burgess\u2019s Earthly Powers. Two writers, by the way, who disliked each other. The book that changed my mind Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens. It expanded my perception of our species in ancient Australia (70-80,000 years ago) and made me feel the breath of the now extinct megafauna on the back of my neck. The last book that made me cry Claire Tomalin\u2019s Charles Dickens: A Life. She managed to convey the extent to which the genius and silly man was, in lacerating his wife and pursuing a new love, so unwittingly dedicated to his own destruction. The last book that made me laugh My friend and fellow antipodean Kathy Lette\u2019s Best Laid Plans. But then Kathy\u2019s been helping me laugh for longer than she would appreciate my saying. The book I couldn\u2019t finish Finnegans Wake by James Joyce. OK, guv, I\u2019m ready to wear the vulgarian handcuffs and do my time. It\u2019s not the first time my family was transported. The book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read Henry James\u2019s The Wings of the Dove. I listened to it as a recorded book, which I think doubles the culpability. The book I give as a gift It\u2019s often G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s The Tin Drum, the consummate novel of dictatorship and war. My father from New South Wales spent nearly three years campaigning against the Reich in north Africa, so I feel closer to the story than would at first seem likely. The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for A new book, The Book of Science and Antiquities, partly set among members of our species in Australia 42,000 years back. Does anyone write a good book at 83? Well, I\u2019m insisting I have. My earliest reading memory Reading the old series What Katy Did in the bush with my female cousins. My comfort read William Boyd, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith. \u2022 Thomas Keneally\u2019s The Book of Science and Antiquities is published by Sceptre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
