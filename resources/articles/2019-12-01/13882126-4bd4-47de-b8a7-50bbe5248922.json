Boyle, 36, faced 19 charges, including criminal harassment, uttering threats, unlawful confinement and administering a noxious substance after his estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman, accused him of abusing her after the family were rescued and returned to Canada. But on Thursday, the Ontario superior court justice Peter Doody said there was not enough evidence to back up Coleman\u2019s testimony. As he dismissed the charges, Doody cast doubt on much of Boyle\u2019s evidence, but also described Coleman\u2019s testimony as \u201cinconsistent\u201d and called into question her credibility and memory. \u201cI do not believe her, just as I do not believe Mr Boyle,\u201d said Doody, arguing that the prosecution failed to present a case that was beyond a reasonable doubt. Boyle and Coleman were already the subject of intense media scrutiny following their dramatic rescue, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent allegations ensured that the case became one of the most high-profile recent trials in Canada. But Thursdays\u2019 verdict highlighted the immense challenges in adjudicating allegations of sexual assault within the justice system, said lawyers in that field. Boyle, who attended each day of the trial and took extensive notes throughout the process, was in court with his parents. \u201cThis is an incredible relief to him,\u201d Boyle\u2019s lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon, told reporters outside the court. Coleman, who lives in the US with her family, travelled to Ottawa to testify in March and April but was not present for the verdict. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to speak with Ms Coleman. She\u2019s devastated by the verdict,\u201d said Ian Carter, her lawyer. \u201cI think the case is an example of the challenges a complainant faces coming forward with allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence \u2026 She needs some time to process what was said today and try and move on with her life.\u201d In 2012, then newlyweds Boyle and Coleman travelled to Afghanistan, where they were kidnapped by a Taliban-linked group shortly after arriving in the restive country. The couple spent five years as captives of the Haqqani network, during which time Coleman gave birth to three children. They were eventually freed by Pakistani soldiers in October 2017, and returned to Canada. In late December, Boyle was arrested in Ottawa and charged with 19 offenses \u2013 including sexual assault, forcible confinement and uttering a death threat \u2013 all of which were alleged to have taken place after the family had arrived in the city. During the trial, which began in March, Coleman testified that during their captivity, Boyle became physically abusive, choking, punching and slapping, as well as threatening to kill her in front of their children. She also told the court how she fled the couple\u2019s Ottawa apartment in fear for her life, wearing only socks on her feet. Boyle admitted he had struck Coleman several times, but said he had done so because she frequently asked to be spanked. Toronto-based lawyer Angela Chaisson, who specializes in sexual assault cases, says complainants often have a difficult time achieving justice in the courts. She pointed to the case of Jian Ghomeshi, the disgraced Canadian radio host who faced accusations of sexual assault from numerous women \u2013 but was acquitted in a controversial 2016 verdict. \u201cThe criminal justice system is in my opinion, a fundamentally flawed way of dealing with sexual assault and domestic violence claims,\u201d she said. In his ruling, Doody acknowledged the toll their kidnapping ordeal had taken on both Boyle and Coleman, saying he had made an effort to disregard their demeanour in the courtroom. With much of the verdict centred on credibility, Doody took issue with evidence submitted by the crown, including a list of \u201crules\u201d which Coleman testified Boyle had drawn up to control her behaviour, diet, exercise and even frequency of sex. When asked by government lawyers if he wrote the document, Boyle told the court he could not recall writing it, nor could he identify his own writing. Doody said Boyle\u2019s testimony was not credible, but \u2013 given contradictions in Coleman\u2019s testimony regarding the list, Doody concluded the document was only circumstantial evidence. Doody also expressed concern over Coleman\u2019s reliability as a witness. She was diagnosed with PTSD following her time as a hostage and testified that she suffered from blackouts and \u201cfits\u201d of anxiety. The judge cautioned that mental health issues do not make a witness unreliable, but nonetheless flagged her \u201cmemory issues\u201d, saying they \u201craise concerns about her ability to accurately recall the events at issue \u2026 and whether the events described took place\u201d. The trial was initially expected to only last weeks, but was repeatedly delayed by procedural questions, including a clash over Coleman\u2019s decision to grant media interviews during the trial, despite Doody\u2019s request not to speak publicly about the case. The various reasons Coleman gave for giving the interviews lacked consistency, said Doody. Given that neither side could provide a compelling case, a legal standard of reasonable doubt meant he was obliged to dismiss the charges, he said. Chaisson said she feared the verdict could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on women who are victims of domestic abuse. \u201cAll the high-profile cases that we see are acquittals and that\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should give us pause, as justice system participants and society at large, and ask us why this is.\u201d Government lawyers did not make a statement to media following the verdict and have not yet indicated if they will appeal. \u201cThis was really, in large part, a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 - there was very, very little confirmatory evidence,\u201d Boyle\u2019s lawyer, Greenspon told Reuters: \u201cUltimately, [the judge] didn\u2019t believe Caitlan and he had many doubts about Josh\u2019s testimony.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
