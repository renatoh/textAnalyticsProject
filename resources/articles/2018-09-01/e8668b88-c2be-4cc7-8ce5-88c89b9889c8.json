In an interview with the Washington Post, Christine Blasey Ford described the incident she says happened in the 1980s, when she and Kavanaugh were high school students. According to the Post, Ford described how Kavanaugh and a friend \u2013 both \u201cstumbling drunk\u201d \u2013 corralled her into a bedroom at a house in Montgomery county, Maryland. The Post reported: \u201cWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\u201d Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California, told the Post: \u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me.\u201d She added: \u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d The newspaper said Ford made contact via an anonymous tip line in the summer, when Kavanaugh\u2019s name began to be linked to the supreme court position. According to the Post, for weeks Ford declined to speak on the record \u201cas she grappled with concerns about what going public would mean for her and her family \u2013 and what she said was her duty as a citizen to tell the story\u201d. The public account is an incendiary intervention in a highly divisive process. The Senate judiciary committee is due to vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination on Thursday, paving the way for a full Senate vote which would require a simple majority to secure his place on the supreme court bench. Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment would tilt the nine-justice panel firmly to the right. Before the Post report was published, John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, said the nomination process had become \u201can intergalactic freakshow\u201d. The Senate judiciary committee member told Fox News Sunday Democrats had done nothing during hearings to raise the contents of a letter about the alleged assault which was reportedly sent in July to the California Democrat Dianne Feinstein. \u201cNothing,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cZero. Nada. Zilch. She didn\u2019t say anything in the confirmation hearings. She didn\u2019t say anything in our confidential session with Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d Feinstein called for an FBI investigation. She said: \u201cIt has always been Mrs Ford\u2019s decision whether to come forward publicly \u2026 from the outset, I have believed these allegations were extremely serious and bear heavily on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s character. However, as we have seen over the past few days, they also come at a price for the victim. I hope the attacks and shaming of her will stop and this will be treated with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Kavanaugh on Friday denied the allegation, which then had only been made in the anonymous leaked letter. \u201cI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation, I did not do this back in high school or at any time,\u201d he said in a statement. In response to the Post story, the White House sent the same statement to outlets including the Guardian. Democrats have argued the nomination process has been rushed, with documents relating to Kavanaugh\u2019s time in the George W Bush White House withheld. Republicans are trying to push the nomination through before the midterm elections in November, when their Senate majority will be at risk. The support of two Republicans \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 was thought to be in question. Both have come under pressure from campaigners who fear Kavanaugh would overturn the Roe v Wade 1973 decision that legalised abortion. Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine considered a key swing vote on the Senate floor, was non-committal about the news. \u201cI\u2019m going to be talking with my colleagues,\u201d she told CNN. A pro-Kavanaugh letter was published on Friday, from a group of 65 women who said they knew him in high school. The letter appears to have been orchestrated by confirmkavanaugh.com, a website funded by the Judicial Crisis Network, which relies upon undisclosed donations and has spent millions on campaigns to get conservatives into judicial positions. The group bought ads in 2016 opposing Barack Obama\u2019s supreme court nominee Merrick Garland and has spent $4.5m to back Kavanaugh. On Sunday, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, called on Republicans to \u201cpostpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated\u201d. But a senior staffer for a Republican on the judiciary committee told the Guardian that as long as Kavanaugh categorically denies the allegation, there is no way to overcome the \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d threshold and justify altering the vote. The source acknowledged that adding a name and a face changed the calculus to a degree but said a number of Republicans feel there is not enough to investigate, with the accuser understandably forgetting details and with no corroborating witnesses. However, the Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, a prominent Trump critic on the judiciary committee, told the Post on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further.\u201d Republicans have a one-vote majority on the committee and Flake\u2019s defection would be a major roadblock towards advancing Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. According to the Post, Ford is a professor at Palo Alto University who teaches in a consortium with Stanford University, training students in clinical psychology. Her work has been widely published. According to her account, she escaped when Kavanaugh\u2019s Georgetown preparatory school friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, \u201csending all three tumbling\u201d. She said she ran, locked herself in a bathroom, then fled the house. The report adds that Ford told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in therapy with her husband. The Post said it reviewed the therapist\u2019s notes, provided by Ford. The notes do not mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students \u201cfrom an elitist boys\u2019 school\u201d who became \u201chighly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington\u201d. Judge told the Weekly Standard he had \u201cno recollection of any of the events described in today\u2019s Post article or attributed to her letter\u201d. Ford told the Post reporters began to make contact after the anonymous description emerged. She said: \u201cNow I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
