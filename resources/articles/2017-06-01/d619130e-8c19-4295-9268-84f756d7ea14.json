The Russian nicknamed Krusher dumped Ward to the canvas early on and dominated the first half of their November fight but he faded just enough to allow the Olympic champion from Oakland to escape with a narrow, controversial unanimous decision. All three judges scored it 114-113 for Ward. The rare match-up between two undefeated champions in their prime somehow managed to live up to the billing, offering fans everything but a definitive conclusion. So they meet again on Saturday night in Las Vegas as Kovalev tries to wrest back the WBA, WBO and IBF titles he surrendered in his first professional setback. It is the best fight that can be made in boxing today: Ward and Kovalev enter at No1 and No2, respectively, in Ring magazine\u2019s pound-for-pound ratings. And there is antipathy between the fighters and their promoters that has lent further intrigue to the proceedings. \u201cI just have one goal, to beat Andre Ward and beat all the shit from him because he doesn\u2019t deserve the belt and the status of a champion,\u201d Kovalev said. \u201cI want to put him back in his place.\u201d The 34-year-old (30-1-1, 26 KOs) believes he overtrained for the first fight, describing the doomed combination of three-a-day workouts and daily half-marathons with a conditioning coach who was afraid to tell him to dial it back. This time he has enlisted a new strength coach in Aleksandr Mikhailovich, whose training philosophy is said to centre around his robust work with biathletes. \u201cThey seem to work well together,\u201d Kovalev\u2019s trainer, John David Jackson, said this week. \u201cIf Mikhailovich did his job, then Sergey will be fine. For the first fight Sergey was running 14 miles a day and I asked him why. I told him he was going to wear his legs out. He is still running but not nearly as much. He is saving himself this time around.\u201d Ward (31-0, 15 KOs), a longtime champion at 168lbs who all but cleaned out the division, went 114-5 in an extraordinary amateur career that culminated with a gold medal at the Athens Games, which remains the last time an American has topped the podium in men\u2019s boxing. The last time he lost a fight was against John Revish at the 1997 National Silver Gloves tournament in Baton Rouge when he was 13. \u201cTactically I obviously want to have a better start and I\u2019m going to have a better start,\u201d the 33-year-old American said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what got me in my hole: the start. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s made some adjustments and he\u2019s going to come harder but I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ve done everything I\u2019m supposed to do. When you prepare the way you\u2019re supposed to, and all the boxes are checked, it\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d Ward, who is promoted by Jay Z\u2019s nascent Roc Nation Sports, has been guaranteed a minimum purse of $6m. Kovalev\u2019s contract has yet to be filed with the Nevada Athletic Commission but it\u2019s said he is due a 75% share of the overall take for Main Events, his longtime promoter, in lieu of a base purse. That means his compensation is in direct proportion with ticket sales and pay-per-view revenue, which many believe will be compromised by Wednesday\u2019s headline-grabbing announcement of the August novelty match between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor. That likely explains why Kovalev stormed off stage before the end of Thursday\u2019s final press conference, declining to participate in interviews and the traditional stare-down photoshoot. His frustration is understandable, but there\u2019s no doubt a reversal of November\u2019s cruel result would offer swift consolation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
