A first-round exit here would have been more disastrous for Posh's economy than their pride, and after a hairy second half they were grateful to skulk away and fret about the replay another day. Bedford, three divisions away in the Ryman Premier, had them rattled, first by nipping at their heels and then by stroking the ball around more confidently as the match wore on. Had Wayne Dyer not dilly-dallied on the way into the Peterborough area they might just have pulled it off, but Marc Joseph got in to take the sting off the shot and the goalkeeper Mark Tyler swiped it away just short of the line. \"Both sides need the money from the replay,\" Fry chuckled. \"We never really looked like scoring. Our shots and headers on target were woeful.\" Uncomfortable as it was, at least Fry was not showered with taunts of Judas all afternoon - not only has he been both player and manager with Bedford over the years, he still lives in the town. Had he felt split loyalties? \"None whatsoever,\" he said, before clarifying with typical Fry-speak, \"Absolutely Posh one million per cent.\" With a red carnation pinned awkwardly to his tracksuit top he strode around the ground meaning business but his players did not take his lead. Neale Fenn was most productive up front for them, though he preferred to pepper the tiny stand behind James Heeps's goal. The locals - including the mayoress, who scrabbled for the ball when it sailed into her part of the stand, and the hardy gaggle that watched from the verge of the Bedford bypass - steeled themselves for an upset, but Dyer's chance was never bettered. \"We were all trying to blow it over the line but we couldn't quite make it. It was a lovely move,\" grinned Bedford's manager Roger Ashby. \"Barry said 'I thought you were tremendous'. I couldn't disagree with him on the day.\" Whether or not that will be the case in the replay remains to be seen, but there is work to be done before then: Peterborough meet the Second Division leaders Brighton on Wednesday; Bedford host Stotfold in the Bedfordshire Premier Cup tomorrow. The Cup is indeed a great leveller. Man of the match : Mark Paul (Bedford)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
