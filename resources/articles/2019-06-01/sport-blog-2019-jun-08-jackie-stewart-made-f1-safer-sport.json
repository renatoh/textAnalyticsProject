The difference between F1 then and now could not be more marked. Death stalked racing in Stewart\u2019s day and that the sport is relatively safe now owes a huge debt to the Scot. His role in pressing for change is well known, but perhaps less so is the huge emotional toll the deaths inflicted and just how difficult it had been trying to force through better safety standards for drivers. Stewart\u2019s F1 career began in 1965. He won titles in 1969 for Matra and in 1971 and 1973 for Tyrrell and retired at the end of that last championship season. He chose not to compete in the final race at Watkins Glen after his friend and teammate Fran\u00e7ois Cevert was killed in practice. He had already decided to retire at that point, but after a career of beating the odds, Cevert\u2019s death was enough to prompt Stewart to walk away from what would have been his 100th grand prix. He left the track and told his wife Helen \u201cI\u2019m no longer a racing driver\u201d, events he recounts in detail and with much emotion in the journalist and broadcaster Will Buxton\u2019s new book, My Greatest Defeat. It is a fascinating collection of interviews in which a variety of drivers, including Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Mika H\u00e4kkinen, Mario Andretti and Emerson Fittipaldi talk of the moments that tested them most. Stewart\u2019s contribution is particularly moving as he remembers the devastating effect of Cevert\u2019s death. Yet he notes with regret the Frenchman was but one of many. He recalls he and Helen counting 57 deaths while he was racing. Many were close friends. \u201cSo many people were killed during that period,\u201d he says. \u201cJochen Rindt was killed, Jim Clark, Fran\u00e7ois, Piers Courage \u2013 and in those days they never stopped the race. You kept racing.\u201d That they did so was entirely normal at the time, but it did not make it any easier to cope with. Rindt died in qualifying for the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, but Stewart carried on. \u201cI was crying when I went into the car because I was with him when he died,\u201d he says. \u201cKen [Tyrrell] had said to me: \u2018Listen, you\u2019ve got to go out\u2019, and I burst into tears in the car. But I went out and I did the quickest lap I\u2019d ever done at Monza at that time. But I got out of the car and I burst into tears again.\u201d Nor was it only the drivers who had to deal with the relentless death toll. When Clark was killed at Hockenheim in 1968 he was the first of four drivers to die in consecutive months. The wives, too, had to shoulder some of the hardest burdens. \u201cThey had a circle called the Dog House Club where they\u2019d all go and have cups of tea when we were with the engineers,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cBette Hill, Helen and all the wives all together. When one of the drivers was killed, all the other wives had to look after each other. Helen had to look after Nina when Jochen was killed, Sally when Piers was killed \u2013 and she looked after me, too. \u201cBut to have to go and pack the bags of somebody who had just been killed, because their wife couldn\u2019t stand to go back to the hotel room, well, Helen had to do that so many times. She went with so many of the wives to the hospital, helping them all in their moment of absolute grief. She was so strong.\u201d Nowadays, Stewart battles on Helen\u2019s behalf with his Race Against Dementia charity, seeking to deal with the disease that has afflicted his wife. He has never backed down from a fight. Prompted by the accident at Spa in 1966 that left him for 25 minutes upside down in his car soaked in fuel, Stewart campaigned robustly to improve safety. For run-off areas, better barriers, advanced medical facilities, proper marshalling; he led boycotts of races at Spa and the N\u00fcrburgring. His work was not welcomed, but was ultimately successful. F1 has had one race-related driver fatality since Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed in 1994. Stewart\u2019s legacy was hard-fought, but is, to an extent, unrecognised. \u201cMy quest for safety had become by far the most unpopular thing that I was faced with,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single corner of any race track in the world called Stewart corner. The organisers, the governing body and the track owners were so angry that somebody who happened to be the world champion was saying that we were not going to race at the N\u00fcrburgring or Spa.\u201d His account reveals the very human and very tragic side of what racing entailed in the 60s and 70s and in doing so illustrates his role in changing it for ever. It seems extraordinary that when Stewart reaches 80 on Tuesday there is still yet to be a corner that bears his name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
