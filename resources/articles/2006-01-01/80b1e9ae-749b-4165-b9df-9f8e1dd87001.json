Confirming talks that would allow NTL to table a \u00a3961m offer for Virgin Mobile, the two companies said there were different ways in which the deal could work. One option would be for Virgin Mobile investors to exchange each share for 372p in cash. Alternatively, they could swap each Virgin Mobile share held for 0.09298 NTL shares. A third option - supported by Virgin Mobile's majority shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin group - would be a mix of NTL shares, convertible stock and cash. In December the board of Virgin Mobile unanimously rejected NTL's initial 323p-a-share approach, which valued the firm at \u00a3817m, saying the offer undervalued the company. The deal represents an attempt to create the UK's first \"quadruple play\" provider, offering mobile and fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and television. Despite the announcement of funding plans today, no formal offer has yet been made by NTL. \"This announcement does not amount to a firm intention to make an offer, and accordingly there can be no assurance that an offer for Virgin Mobile will be made even if the pre-conditions are satisfied or waived,\" Virgin Mobile said in a statement. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
