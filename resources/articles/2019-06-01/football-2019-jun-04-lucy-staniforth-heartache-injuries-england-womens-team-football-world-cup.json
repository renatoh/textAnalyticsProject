She looked shocked. Wheeling away with one arm raised aloft in tribute to her hero Alan Shearer she couldn\u2019t hold the pose. The other arm shot up too and she wiggled in delight. If scoring the opener against Japan at the SheBelieves Cup elicits such emotion, making a World Cup took it to another level, and Shearer announcing her selection only added to it. But it has been a tough journey. \u201cIf you\u2019d have said 12 months ago I\u2019d be sat here, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it,\u201d the 26-year-old Birmingham midfielder says. \u201cI\u2019ve had two cruciate ligament injuries. I did them back-to-back so I\u2019d say I was out for three years, all told. \u201cI think someone once said to me that, although I\u2019m 26, in terms of the matches I\u2019ve played I\u2019m probably only 23 or 24 so that has taken the pressure off me and I\u2019ve had to be patient.\u201d Those two ACL ruptures could have driven her from the game. But she found inspiration in the former England international Claire Rafferty. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many moments along the way when I\u2019ve thought to myself: \u2018This just isn\u2019t going to work out.\u2019 But there have been people like Claire Rafferty and she has done her ACL three times. I reached out to her and took inspiration from her. \u201cI was thinking to myself: \u2018I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to do this.\u2019 Then I thought: \u2018I can, get over yourself, she has done it three times.\u2019\u201d The emotion is perhaps in the genes. Before her goal against Japan, a 10-minute run out against Brazil in Philadelphia sent her mum, Sandra, to pieces. \u201cShe\u2019s always crying in the stands. I played against Brazil, I came on for 10 minutes. I looked up at her during a break and all I could see was her bright red face. I didn\u2019t even really contribute,\u201d she laughs. Family matters. A lot. Staniforth has worn 37 on the back of her shirt in tribute to her brother Thomas who died aged 20, when Lucy was 16, on a night out in York \u2013 37 was his squad number at Sheffield Wednesday. \u201cI pay homage to his career, even though it was cut short,\u201d reflects Staniforth. \u201cUnfortunately, these things happen. A few of the girls have been through similar situations with their own family, all of us will try to pay tribute to them during this World Cup. When it was my birthday, the FA made a fantastic gesture and got me a cake with \u2018Staniforth 37\u2019 on it. That was really touching. It\u2019s at moments like that you realise you are in a privileged position and you want to make the most of it.\u201d Alongside the injuries and heartache has been a tumultuous club career, often outside of her control. In 2008 she had to find a new club after Sunderland, where she would pay \u00a3180 for kit, ran out of money, and, when back at the club 10 years later, she was forced to leave after it decided to drop into the amateur leagues and not bid for a spot in the professional tiers. \u201cMy first experience of playing women\u2019s football was with Sunderland,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWithin a year of starting for them in the top division, we were told that we wouldn\u2019t be there any longer because of financial reasons. \u201cThat was back in 2007-08. It was a shock. And I had to find a new club. I had one year of the hard times, then everything started to improve once they brought in the Women\u2019s Super League.\u201d Now, and having appeared at all England youth levels, Staniforth is heading to her first World Cup. It is not something she ever imagined. \u201cI always hoped girls would go to the men\u2019s World Cup,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise there was a girls\u2019 team. I didn\u2019t realise it wasn\u2019t going to work out in my favour. I first realised women\u2019s football was my thing when I first met Sue Smith who is a bit of legend and that was it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
