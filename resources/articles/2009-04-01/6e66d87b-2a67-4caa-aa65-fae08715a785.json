Yesterday in Bristol, some 50 of his pressbox confr\u00e8res from a cross-section of the generations took the West Country wordsmith (and sometimes emeritus of this patch here) to a surprise slap-up birthday lunch. The occasion was definitely not sponsored by any temperance society. Seasoned readers will know how, for summer after summer for four decades, and from his beloved Wessex shires between the Severn and the sea, Foot's compassionate and earthy day-by-day chronicles of county cricket have warmed and illuminated these pages. As well, there has been a fruitfully impressive output of books, scripts and evocative monograph and memoir on cricketers, heroes and fellow writers. Locally, Foot remains a cherished eminence as columnist and champion of causes. His deadlines, too, have been met spot-on as a sharp and perceptive Bristol theatre critic down the years and, on a thousand winter Saturdays, 600 words on-the-whistle from City, Rovers, or his hometown Yeovil, where it all began 64 summers ago in 1945 on the weekly Western Gazette. The trainee 25-shilling-a-week copy-boy, just 16, tremulously cycled in from the family's East Coker cottage in his new broadish-brimmed brown trilby hat and six-guinea brown pinstripe suit fresh-off-the-peg of Yeovil's high-class outfitters, Messrs Bone &amp; Flagg. It was, of course, the straw hat and the loose, light skimpy linen jacket of cricket watching which was to become David's favourite business uniform. Especially in high summer when the pressbox was relocated to a marquee on the boundary edge decked with hanging baskets and festive bunting at Bath or Cheltenham, Weston or Gloucester or Bournemouth or Frome. In those languid gossipy days, Footie held court and sway, the press tent his very hearth and home, his sanctum. And in them, as decade followed decade, East Coker's kindly wise-innocent \u2013 with his charm and generosity and smile which lit up the lived-in autumnal face \u2013 grew to be this freemasonry's soft and scrupulous monarch. David and I first met half a century ago. In 1959 he was a star top-of-the-bill performer on the Bristol Evening World \u2013 as a senior reporter, acclaimed general feature writer, ace theatre critic, and No1 Pink 'Un reporter from Ashton Gate. I was the greenest of greenhorn subeditors. Unlike most newsroom bullies, Foot was the kindest of counsellors to a bewildered cub. Many years later and once again working for the same newspaper \u2013 this one \u2013 our paths would seldom cross because we'd both be covering different matches during my own relished and relishable stint on the county circuit of summer two or three decades ago. When they did, however, the catch-up made for a most convivial bonus. Around the turn of the millennium, Foot wrote: \"The pressbox is kinship; I love the chirpy, companionable aura. Repartee is sharp, incestuous jokes are traded, legs pulled. Whatever the public's perceptions, we all have a great affection for the game. We drink and eat and talk cricket. We all know we're bloody privileged. I daresay most of us are, very loosely, frustrated novelists. We certainly all like words, don't we?\" Long ago David told me how, having filed his copy and driven home after a long summer's day, his good wife Anne would always greet him with the inquiry, not of who scored what or who took the wickets, but simply: \"Was it a good box today, dear?\" When the Evening World closed in 1961, big-time Fleet Street seriously wooed Foot. Name his price. He preferred to be a freelance, as he puts it, \"jobber\" in his own happy state of contented rumpled rusticity. And as well as the unending joy of \"good boxes\", so did the good books begin to flow. Under a variety of hard covers there were telling psychological monographs on such one-offs as Cec Parkin and Charlie Parker, Carwyn James, Kid Berg and Alec Stock. In Fragments of Idolatry, Foot's portraits of the olde-tyme polymath journalists, Alan Gibson and Raymond Robertson-Glasgow \u2013 each utterly joyous at the job, wretchedly screwed-up in life \u2013 are masterpieces. Two full-length biogs are already imperishable classics in cricket's canon \u2013 Harold Gimblett: Tormented Genius and Wally Hammond: The Reasons Why. Of those last four names, two committed suicide, the other two seriously contemplated it. Such choices of subject are not examples of an author's own melancholic paranoia, but of his innate and instinctive compassion \u2013 the quality which, as many of you know, has always blessed Foot's writing. Resolute four-square compassion \u2013 and the heartiest of four-score congratulations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
