The news came as BT reported quarterly results that showed its embattled consumer business increased revenues for the first time in four years, helped by success in what it terms \"new wave\" business such as broadband. But the results left City analysts unimpressed because of high restructuring charges that saw headline profits drop 31% to \u00a3435m in the three months to the end of September. More than 2,000 middle managers have left the business over the past few months as part of a \u00a3450m restructuring plan designed to reduce the company's bureaucracy. A further 2,000 managers and 1,000 other staff are expected to take voluntary redundancy in the second half of the year and at least another 1,000 will leave in 2008. But BT, which employed 250,000 people at the time of its privatisation, has been hiring engineers and its workforce has stabilised at about 105,000. BT added 178,000 new broadband customers in the quarter, taking its base over 4 million for the first time. Carphone Warehouse's TalkTalk added 89,000 to take its total to 2.5 million. \"The UK broadband market is probably the most aggressive in the world and we are doing OK in it,\" said BT's chief executive, Ben Verwaayen, who also hit out at the \"free\" broadband offers TalkTalk introduced. \"Trying to be cheaper than the next guy is a short-term mug's game. We want to compete on value not price.\" Carphone Warehouse boss Charles Dunstone, however, said his company had held back from adding new customers to the AOL business it bought a year ago because it was building out its own telecoms network to service them. With much of that work now done, \"I think we're back on a growth phase\", he said, forecasting 200,000 to 250,000 new broadband customers over the next six months. Since TalkTalk launched \"free\" broadband a year and a half ago, Carphone has invested well over \u00a3200m putting its equipment into BT exchanges. It now has more than half its customers directly connected and in the six months to the end of September its telecoms business moved from an \u00a311m loss last year to a \u00a339m profit before financial charges. \"We are genuinely turning broadband into a profitable business,\" said Mr Dunstone. Carphone Warehouse made a first-half pre-tax profit of \u00a356m, up from \u00a314m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
