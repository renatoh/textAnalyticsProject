At a seminar organised by the regulator today as part of its strategic review of the UK's telecoms market, Ofcom boss Stephen Carter also characterised BT's recently proposed changes to its organisation \"as a response of two halves\". He told industry executives at the seminar that he intends to test whether BT's commitment to \"fair and balanced competition\" can be made to work in practice. If, by the end of June, Ofcom is not satisfied that it can produce a workable solution, the regulator will call on the Competition Commission to investigate and advise it to split the company's network operation from its retail business. Ofcom first made this threat late last year, when it published the interim results of its review of the market, but has not set a timetable until now. To avoid break-up, BT was last year asked to suggest changes to its organisation and behaviour to ensure its network business treats rival operators in exactly the same way as it treats BT Retail. Earlier this month BT handed in 111 pages of proposals, including the creation of an \"access services division\". This new business unit would deal solely with the copper wires that connect BT's local telephone exchanges to homes and businesses. This network of wires is known as the local loop, and getting competition into it - a process termed \"unbundling\" - is seen by Ofcom as crucial to creating real innovation in Britain's communications market. Mr Carter said: \"It would not be unfair to characterise BT's response as a response of two halves. One half being perhaps an understandable and legally justifiable, denial and rejection of our analysis, and the other half being a series of positive and potentially productive proposals.\" \"The access services division structural proposal, the recognition of the existence of enduring economic bottlenecks, a shared commitment to a successful unbundling of the local loop, both economically and in process terms... are all welcome commitments,\" he said. \"We will be working with BT and others between now and the end of June to deliver a series of binding undertakings and detail that will seek to stress-test the public commitments that have been made to equivalence and to the prospect of fair and balanced competition.\" Ofcom will publish the final conclusions of its year-and-a-half-long probe into the UK's telecoms market in the late summer. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
