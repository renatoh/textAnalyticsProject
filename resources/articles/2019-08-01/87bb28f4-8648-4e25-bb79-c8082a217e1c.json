Court documents reveal Shell\u2019s main Australian company, Shell Energy Holdings Australia, has been fighting the ATO for six years over tax on the company\u2019s stake in the $30bn Browse gas project off the coast of north-west Western Australia. The ATO\u2019s pursuit of Shell is part of a broader effort to shake money out of big oil and gas projects that one of the authority\u2019s most senior officials says has brought forward tax revenue by a decade. Second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn declined to comment on the Shell dispute but said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d big oil and gas projects would start to pay significant tax by 2021. In an interview with the Guardian, Hirschhorn also revealed that every year the ATO received an average of two leaked sets of data about the clients of accountants, law firms and other service providers around the world, and expressed relief at victory over mining group Glencore this month in a high court fight over the ATO\u2019s use of Paradise Papers documents. The previously secret Shell stoush is revealed in documents the company filed in the federal court this month after the ATO threw out its objections in June and July. Shell has asked the court to set aside the ATO\u2019s decision to disallow $2.2bn in deductions the company has claimed for buying shares of gas tenements from another partner in the Browse project, Chevron, in 2012 and 2014. Browse, Australia\u2019s largest untapped conventional gas resource, has been in development for 15 years but has never entered production because of falls in oil and gas prices. Tax law requires an asset to be used for exploration or mining before a deduction can be made. However, Shell told the federal court it \u201cused each asset by having it \u2018held in reserve\u2019 or otherwise held ready for use in its business\u201d. A Shell spokeswoman said the company was \u201cengaging with the Australian Taxation Office with a view to confirming the correct tax outcome of Shell\u2019s 2012 acquisition of interests in the Browse project\u201d. \u201cShell complies with all its legal and taxation obligations and is committed to paying the right amount of tax under the letter and the spirit of the law in all countries in which we operate,\u201d she said. Hirschhorn said the ATO acted early to squash the efforts of multinationals to send profits reaped from Australia\u2019s oil and gas boom offshore without paying any tax in the country. Two years ago, ATO officials were alarmed at the prospect that the big oil companies would avoid paying up to $10bn in tax over 10 years by pumping up the interest rate they paid on loans their local arms took out with offshore affiliates to finance the mega-projects. However, a legal victory over Chevron, the lead partner on the country\u2019s biggest project, Gorgon, emboldened the ATO to take on the rest of the industry. Last year, Chevron paid the ATO $866m to settle the lawsuit, which alleged the 9% interest rate charged on a US$2.5bn inter-company loan was far too high. In December last year, Hirschhorn was promoted from deputy commissioner in charge of large companies to second commissioner for client engagement \u2013 a euphemistic title that puts him in charge of tax enforcement and about half the ATO\u2019s 18,000 employees. He declined to comment on the Shell case but said the ATO continued to take action over related party debt and other tax issues in the resources sector. \u201cNot all those disputes have washed through,\u201d he said. He said it was natural that the big projects would pay little or no tax in their early years, due to the billions of dollars poured into building them that needed to be recouped before profits could be made. \u201cOur success will be as a tax office if they start paying tax, very significant tax, in 2021, 2022, which we\u2019re very confident will happen, rather than not paying tax up until the 2030s,\u201d he said. He said the ATO was \u201clate to the table\u201d in dealing with the use by mining companies including BHP and Rio Tinto of so-called \u201cmarketing hubs\u201d in Singapore to reduce tax in Australia. \u201cIt was really important for us to get ahead of the curve with the hubs for the gas producers, so we didn\u2019t have that problem right from the start, so that\u2019s been a big focus for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mostly successful and hoping to move to complete success.\u201d The attack on the resources sector also forms part of a broader ATO attack on \u201ctransfer pricing\u201d abuse, where the Australian arms of multinationals pay inflated prices for goods, services or loans to their offshore affiliates, thus siphoning money away from the country without tax being paid. Hirschhorn said the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, which came into effect in 2016, had put an end to a practice where some multinationals liked to pretend their Australian arms did nothing but distribute boxes. \u201cBut in the real world they\u2019re a bit more than Australia Post, they\u2019ve got people meeting the doctors, they\u2019ve got people lobbying the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, they\u2019re actually selling stuff here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are running a successful business which would ordinarily earn commissions. In the real world, you would not \u2018donate\u2019 that successful business, with its rewards and risks of earning commission, in order to go onto a \u2018cost plus 5%\u2019 business model, meaning that you pay minuscule tax in Australia [and earn most of your profits offshore in a tax haven]. \u201cI describe this as the \u2018kidney donor\u2019 approach to transfer pricing: just because you can point to someone living a full life on dialysis, doesn\u2019t support a proposition that someone would remove their own kidneys and go on dialysis to transfer the \u2018risks and rewards\u2019 of their kidneys to someone else.\u201d He said the high court\u2019s 14 August decision allowing the ATO to use documents from the Paradise Papers leak in a tax case against commodities group Glencore meant that \u201cthe status quo prevails\u201d. \u201cI read something by one journalist that said Australia\u2019s going to be a haven for hackers,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed. If we had lost we would not have been able to rely on any information leaked or obtained from a law firm, or probably any whistleblowers. \u201cOn the existing Panama Papers we would have had to chuck them all out and pretend we had never seen them.\u201d He said the ATO would have to say \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d to the average of two data leaks it received every year, mostly from other revenue agencies. It is understood the ATO is interested in a fresh leak of data from Malta, a major offshore centre that is often used as a gateway to Europe and is popular with Russian oligarchs. Hirschhorn said leaks were increasingly large. \u201cIn the old days people could only steal or take a couple of paper files, you had to photocopy them,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it can be gigabytes or terabytes of documents on one little USB.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
