Asked to explain what Mandelson had brought to Labour after four years in Brussels, the minister replied: \"He is political, he thinks politically about everything. We have not had that enough. We've been run by people with white boards in middle management.\" Another special adviser said Mandelson had \"confidence\". \"For too long there have been ministers that have lived in fear of the Tories. By what he did to George Osborne over the Corfu yacht affair, he just turned the tables on the Tories for the first time. Mandelson's return has unnerved them. His very presence destabilises people like Osborne. He has a reputation inside the Tory party that frightens their strategists. They have to second guess what he will do.\" Mandelson has been a divisive figure within Labour over the years. But he has had an extended honeymoon period since he returned to government, which has drowned out the criticism that followed the appointment. According to Derek Draper, a former special adviser to Mandelson, the business secretary is now playing a central role. \"Peter has built Gordon's confidence and Gordon's operation. He is there in Downing Street every day pretty much. His influence has been tremendous. The great thing is that he is getting on with people that he did not before like Ed Balls. That is very important.\" Mandelson even spoke to Charlie Whelan, Brown's former press chief, the other day \u2013 the political equivalent to the Irish National Liberation Army holding a joint Christmas party with the Shankill butchers. Mandelson used to be annoyed with Balls because he didn't think him very clever, Draper said. \"But he had never worked with him, only against him. He now understands that Balls is clever and they are getting on. Balls has been Brown's close adviser for years and could have been put out by the sudden emergence of Mandelson, but seems relaxed. There are still turf wars, but it is more of a normal turf war. They are all rowing in the same direction. They are not in different camps any longer. Until the summer there were two camps in Number 10.\" The change in Labour's confidence and fortune has been stark. The decision to postpone the mooted September 2007 election, the attempt to upstage the Tory conference by the visit to Iraq, the 10p tax debacle and the byelection setbacks had left the prime minister questioning not just himself, but his advisers. By the summer, Brown knew he was on the verge of losing the leadership. Mandelson was one figure who told him he needed to change the way he operated, make up his mind what he wanted to do and stick to it, or else he would be out. Brown, according to one account, said he knew how perilous his position was. The then chief whip, Geoff Hoon, thought privately that Brown was on the verge of losing the support of the parliamentary party. The credit crunch gave Brown a new beginning, and Mandelson is now acting as a safety valve, heading off potential problems before they arise. He sits on 33 of the 39 cabinet committees, affording him tremendous reach across government. Ministers report that Brown and Mandelson are very deferential to one another in meetings. One cabinet minister says: \"Gordon wants it to be known that Peter is being listened to and Peter in turn wants to show him respect. But Peter is also one of the few people that has the confidence and history to joke at Gordon's expense in public. It is friendly. They can finish each other's sentences. It makes cabinet committees more fun. It had become pretty dour.\" Brown can be an intimidating figure, and arguably too many people in Number 10 lived in fear of him. The atmosphere has changed, partly because the whole machine is directed to one purpose: dealing with the recession. One economic minister said: \"There is an esprit de corps partly because we meet so often and have so much to do.\" Mandelson has been intimately involved in the pre-budget debate, the post office card account, the controversial proposals to part-privatise the Royal Mail and even the latest decision to drop elected police boards. Draper said: \"He [Brown] is getting the man who knows everything about presentation and strategy, but he is also getting someone who now has thought a lot about business, markets and regulation. The old Mandelson did not know about policy. He wrote that pretty bland book, and even then most of it was written by Roger Liddle. Now he really understands business.\" Three speeches on the role of industrial activism is already a pretty impressive corpus of thought, matched recently only by the speeches of Ed and David Miliband. But there are potential pitfalls ahead. It is possible that Mandelson will revert to type and start to feel persecuted. Either the pressure of work or the slight love of risk will take him to dangerous places. Partly due to the way he had to battle, and partly due to aspects of his private life, he was sometimes unnecessarily nasty in the way he dealt with people, or suddenly dropped them. He has made many political enemies over the years. One Number 10 staffer said: \"He is not like anyone else. You cannot predict what he is going to say every time he opens his mouth. Sometimes he addresses cabinet like it is a railway carriage. He has to be really careful he does not overreach himself.\" One explanation for the success of the rapprochement is that Brown never wanted to fall out with Mandelson, even after the latter backed Blair for the party leadership in 1994. The feud began ahead of a major weekend strategy session. The two men met ahead of time to discuss how they should handle the event. Mandelson told him he had only one master now, Blair, and they could not operate together as they had. From then on, Brown felt angry with Mandelson. But now there is only one master: Brown. So far, Mandelson's return appears to have been broadly popular within the party. One cabinet minister makes it their business to stay in touch with party chairmen and women, ringing them regularly to canvass their opinion. \"People admire that Peter came back when the party was down. He did not need to, but he is a fighter. People forget that he started working for the party initially at its lowest point. People remember him and the 1997 landslide, but he joined the party well before then when the party was in danger of sliding into third place behind the Liberal Democrats.\" Brown recently asked Mandelson whether he was happy back in the cabinet, and the business secretary replied that he was. He wished he had a few more levers to pull, but then, he mused: \"Given what is going on in the world, I suppose every minister feels the same.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
