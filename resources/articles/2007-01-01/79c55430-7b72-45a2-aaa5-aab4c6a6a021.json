It proved to be something of a surprise hit, with geeks loving its classy screen, elegant browsing experience and the fact it ran on a Linux, as opposed to Windows, operating system. For its successor, the just-launched N800, Nokia has smartened the device up and made a few tweaks, but largely stuck with the 770's successful template. So, for example, there's no pull-out QWERTY keypad - instead, users input text either using the supplied stylus or through its large touch-screen keypad. There's no way users can touch type using this, but it might prove handy for long emails. The sober black styling of the 770 has also gone, to be replaced by a more contemporary looking silver. The device also has a speedier processor and a lot more internal memory (128MB), although the screen resolution is the same. Another innovation is a mini web cam for video conferencing, while a Skype VoIP application for the device will be available soon. This is good overhaul of what was already a cracking product. But sorry, Nokia - I would still like that pull-out keyboard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
