Andrew Rose was fishing in the Northern Territory\u2019s Kakadu national park when he snagged a 15cm-long worm goby \u2013 a rare, mud-dwelling fish with no eyes, a bony head and sharp teeth. \u201cIt looked prehistoric,\u201d Rose told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt looked like something you see in the movies. The lure wasn\u2019t swimming right, I pulled it and it had this strange looking fish on it. We didn\u2019t know what it was. We took photos, took him off the hook and put him back in the water.\u201d On social media, many compared the fish to a Xenomorph, a monstrous alien species from the 1979 sci-fi horror film Alien, and its sequels. Rose\u2019s fellow angler and friend, Tee Hokin, told ABC News: \u201cThe first thing I thought about was the Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver and that thing that comes out of people\u2019s stomachs. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even move or wriggle. It was like stunned, like stealth mode \u2026 You\u2019d probably shit your pants if it was bigger.\u201d Dr Michael Hammer, a fish expert from the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, told the ABC he thought it was a worm goby, from the genus Taenioides. Hammer said the fish, native to the NT, was \u201crarely seen by people\u201d and was not dangerous. Rose, who has been fishing in the area for the past two years, said he and his friends caught it near the Shady Camp mouth, where they go to fish for barramundi and tuna. He said the worm goby was the first bite he got after six hours of no luck. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that exciting, to be honest. We were fishing for barramundi, waiting for the first push of the high tide. I just caught it on a ready-lure. \u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like it. The technique was holding a beer and rod in the same time \u2013 the beer I was drinking was called Captain Sensible.\u201d Rose said he hired a boat on most weekends from local company Outback Boat Hire, whose owners Wayne and Sueellen Wrigley, shared the images online. \u201cI got some good barra at the end of it,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe caught maybe 15 barra afterwards.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
