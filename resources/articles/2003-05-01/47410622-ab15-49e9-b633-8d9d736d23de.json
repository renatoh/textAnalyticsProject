Is the stress of being a multi-millionaire retail entrepreneur linked to every deal in town finally telling on Philip Green? Say it cannot be so. He cancelled a meeting with Safeway, the supermarket chain he hopes to buy, at the eleventh hour last week, blaming ill-health. Imagine the disappointment at Safeway, whose executives have been begging for this meeting for some weeks, mostly in the hope that Green will clarify his intentions in his famously forthright style. We on Cheapside wish him the speediest of recoveries and our resident back-room quack takes the liberty of suggesting a cure by the seaside, avoidance of cuss-inducing situations and, if all else fails, a good old-fashioned toga party. French stick To a swanky London hotel, where American construction giant Bechtel hosts a conference for 1,000 generous souls who wish to help rebuild Iraq. A useful diagram indicates the number of firms from each country that have already registered for duty. America has 2,800, Britain 326 and then the graph lists Turkey, Italy, India, Australia, Spain, Canada and even Poland before citing 645 in the 'other' category. Bechtel is asked where the French fit into all of this. They have put in for 50 sub-contracts - having decided not to guard Europe's morals after all - but have been relegated to the 'other' category by the Americans. Petit mal, will the hostilities never cease? Beoynd belief Rumours filter into the darkest parts of Cheapside's thoroughfare (and they are really very murky) that financiers from investment boutique Greenhill have been spotted visiting WH Smith executives on an unusually frequent basis. Gossips infer that some sort of corporate activity is afoot and mutter wicked words such as 'takeover'. Some mistake. WH Smith, as any fool knows, is not up for sale and is in no position to buy anybody else. Star treks Unusual tour operator Beautiful Holidays circulates word of its Sars special. A nose job in Penang, with flights and a fortnight at a three-star Malaysian beach hotel thrown in, costs less than the surgery alone in the UK. A boob job bargain break starts at \u00a32,100. BH's Matthew Tucker enthuses: 'A strong exchange rate has made the pound over 10 per cent more valuable against the ringgit. Secondly, a general malaise in the travel industry brought about by international events, including Sars, has resulted in travel operators offering exceptional pricing.' Capitalism, doncha just luvvit? Hi Ned ... Doh! It has become of a point of pride on Cheapside that we can offer business luminaries a valuable consultancy service if only they will take advice. This week we counsel Brendan O'Neill, former chief executive of ICI, free, gratis and for nothing. Brendan, or 'Ousted Brendan' as unkind sections of the press now call him, is under the spotlight because he stands to gain a \u00a31m pay-off. We ask for not one penny of this windfall, but urge him to hire as a useful double to one Ned Flanders, good Christian neighbour of Homer Simpson. Their mothers couldn't tell them apart. Sounds foney A delightful frisson enlivens the gloom as advance notice of a book entitled The Turbulent Life and Times of Vodaphone and Chris Gent arrives. Has Gent been running two companies with nobody noticing? Does this explain much of the turbulence at Vodafone, where his work is better known? A glance at the book itself however reveals that the company in question is Vodafone after all. The press release has slipped as it bills 'Reputations won and lost during the rollercoaster ride of Gent and Vodaphone'. Indeed they are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
