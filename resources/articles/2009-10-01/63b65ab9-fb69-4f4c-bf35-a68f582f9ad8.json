And he's got unfinished bizzle: at least three times he reminds us that he's returning with a third solo record. But rather than Going Hard as the title intones, the Walthamstow MC continues on the pop-ish bent of 2007's Back to Bizznizz and features the king of quacking brass sections himself, Mark Ronson, plus an unimaginative take on House of Pain's Jump Around. It's actually the Ronson track, Lost My Mind, featuring a great violin riff, that stands out here among Bizzle's self-aggrandisement. This album works best when it does what it implores and makes its beats go four to the floor: a heavy take on Salt-n-Pepa's Push It is among the best things here. But this is a record let down by odd decisions, chief among them being an awful slowed-down vocal effect that acts as its recurring motif."}, "isHosted": false}}}
