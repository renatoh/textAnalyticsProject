Declaring him \"friendless\", the Tote last night pushed Istabraq's price out to 15-8 from 7-4, and though it represents merely an extra 12.5p for every \u00a31 staked, the move will raise concerns that all is not well with the champion. Odds of 7-4 against Istabraq winning an unprecedented fourth championship were already the best available with any major bookie yesterday morning. Since his somewhat unconvincing victory at Leopardstown last month, no one seems prepared to back him with anything more than sentiment. \"We haven't been able to give Istabraq away in our Champion Hurdle market,\" Jeremy Scott, the Tote's spokesman, said yesterday, \"and he remains a winner in our book. With some shrewd money coming in for some of the young pretenders, including Brother Joe, Valiramix and Landing Light, we're now more than prepared to lay a chunk on Istabraq.\" The champion was a 2-1 on chance for last year's Champion Hurdle before the Festival fell victim to the foot-and-mouth crisis. However, he was as big as 11-8 before his cruise to victory in the AIG Irish Champion Hurdle last January. Istabraq has used that race to warm up for Cheltenham in each of the last four seasons, but though he has been entered for this year's renewal on January 27, he is not expected to line up. Aidan O'Brien spoke of the pressure of training a national idol after Istabraq's successful reappearance last month. The horse is also a particular favourite of JP McManus, his owner, and it is unlikely that either man would risk Istabraq at Cheltenham if they felt that his great talent was on the wane. If Istabraq is showing signs at home that he is feeling his age - he is now 10 - then not even the 2.4-1 available on an internet betting exchange yesterday about an extraordinary fourth success in the Champion Hurdle would represent any value. Another champion who is trying punters' faith at present is Tony McCoy, whose losing streak will be as newsworthy as his total of winners if his current run of form continues much longer. The champion has now ridden eight straight losers, including four favourites, after a frustrating afternoon at Wincanton yesterday left him stuck on 199 for the season. McCoy arrived at the track with stitches in the back of his head and several large bruises, the legacy of three falls at Newbury on Wednesday. He was passed fit to ride by Paul Philips, the course doctor, and managed to complete the course on his first three rides, but then complained of muscle strain and bruising. Philips stood him down for the remainder of the meeting, and he will need to pass another examination in order to ride at Huntingdon this afternoon. McCoy was placed on each of his mounts yesterday, though since all three started favourite, a second and two thirds was not what the punters were expecting. \"I'm a bit sore and it was getting stiffer around the back of my neck where I got kicked yesterday at Newbury,\" he said. \"It just wasn't getting any better. We'll have to see how I feel in the morning before I decide whether I'm going to ride at Huntingdon. If I feel as well as I did this morning then I will consider riding but we'll see how my neck feels.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
