The Swede soared to an eight-shot victory in Sunday's Kraft Nabisco Championship and then announced: \"I want to savour this win and take a few weeks off.\" It means Sorenstam may decide against going for a sixth straight success on the LPGA Tour, having matched the winning streak of five achieved by Nancy Lopez in 1978. In gaining a record-equalling third win in the first major of the year Sorenstam set up the prospect of achieving an unprecedented grand slam. \"The grand slam is very difficult because you have to peak at different times of the season and on very different courses,\" Sorenstam said. \"Also, everyone is desperate to win the majors. I've always said I want to win 10 majors and now I've got eight, so I'm just going to look forward to the rest of the season.\" The next leg of her grand-slam attempt will be the McDonald's LPGA Championship at Bulle Rock in Maryland. Then there are the US Women's Open at Cherry Hills Country Club near Denver and the Weetabix Women's British Open at Royal Birkdale in July. With a 59th career win, Sorenstam is now fourth on the all-time list behind Kathy Whitworth (88), Mickey Wright (82) and Patty Berg (60). She has dominated the women's game for four years now and her eight-shot win over American Rosie Jones at Mission Hills suggested the gap is widening between her and the rest. For now, the main contest is Sorenstam versus the record books"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
