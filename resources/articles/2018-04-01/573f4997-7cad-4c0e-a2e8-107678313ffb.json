After a trial last July that lasted just two days, Mohammed Ibrahim \u201cMo\u201d Munshi was jailed and fined $15m over a coal deal struck between Gobi Coal and Energy, of which he was chairman, and a company owned by Chuluunbaatar Baz, a member of a prominent Mongolian family. Munshi is the latest in a string of foreign investors to find themselves hit with arbitrary travel bans or prosecuted over business deals in resource-rich Mongolia, as local partners seek to seize assets or alter agreements. Last month, Mongolia\u2019s supreme court upheld his conviction, while reducing his original 11-year sentence to seven years on a technicality. Munshi\u2019s only hope for earlier release lies with an international arbitration application \u2013 a process that could take several months \u2013 or with a complaint to the United Nations human rights council alleging he was denied a fair trial. Munshi\u2019s son, Arif, told the Guardian from Perth, where Munshi\u2019s children and elderly parents live, that they fear he will not survive a long prison sentence, particularly during Mongolia\u2019s harsh winters. Munshi has already been hospitalised and the medications he requires regularly run out. \u201cHonestly, I fear for my father\u2019s life,\u201d Arif Munshi said. \u201cHe has several serious health concerns which are not being adequately treated. If the Mongolian authorities cannot provide the medications they saw fit to prescribe him, what hope does he have of maintaining his health? \u201cIn the closed prison, he is housed with dangerous criminals including rapists and murderers. He lives in constant fear for his safety and his life.\u201d Arif Munshi has said he has been \u201cdisillusioned and disappointed\u201d by the diplomatic efforts of the Australian government to assist his father. He said he had understood that while his father\u2019s trial and appeals processing were ongoing, governments were reluctant to intervene in, or publicly pressure, the judicial processes of a foreign country. \u201cBut we are now at the end of the legal process and we are asking what can the Australian and British governments do? \u201cGiven the lack of evidence and the total disregard shown by the Mongolian legal system for its own laws, is the Australian government going to do something to help? Can the Australian government honestly say that my father has been given a fair trial, or even a fair go?\u201d A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was \u201cproviding consular assistance to a dual UK-Australian national serving a prison sentence in Mongolia, in accordance with the Consular Services Charter\u201d. Munshi\u2019s Australian lawyer, Alisdair Putt, a former commonwealth and state prosecutor, and investigator in the International Criminal Court prosecutor\u2019s office, said he does not believe Munshi received a fair trial or appeals process. \u201cThere was minimal evidence presented at trial that could result in a conviction ... this matter should have been treated as a commercial dispute between two companies.\u201d Munshi\u2019s dispute arose after Baz\u2019s company, Monnis International, invested $10m in Gobi Coal\u2019s proposed mining projects in the south-west of the country. But when the global coal price collapsed in 2012, a proposed initial public offering was postponed, with the projects put on hold until prices recovered. Other investors acceded to ride out the price dip, but Baz reportedly demanded his money back. Attempts at arbitration failed, and when Munshi visited Mongolia in 2015 he was hit with a travel ban and his passports were confiscated. The dispute dragged on until mid-2017, when Munshi was arrested, tried, convicted in a two-day trial and jailed. Gobi Coal\u2019s licence over coal deposits was also suspended. In court documents from the trial, Baz alleged he had been tricked into investing in the projects and defrauded of his investment. Munshi has denied the allegations and said the case was a business dispute that should be settled by international arbitration, not by punitive use of the criminal justice system. Court documents state that Baz repeatedly offered to abandon the criminal prosecution in exchange for some of his investment being returned. Attempts by the Guardian to contact Baz have not been returned. Both the Australian and UK governments have highlighted the use of travel bans as a tactic to settle commercial disputes in Mongolia, while the US state department has warned: \u201cInvestors and local legal experts have grown to fear what they call the capricious and arbitrary use of travel bans by Mongolian officials, sometimes at the behest of private interests, as a means to coerce foreign investors to settle civil and criminal disputes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
