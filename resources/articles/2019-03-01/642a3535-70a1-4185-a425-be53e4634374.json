On Wednesday Morrison refused to firm up his commitment by agreeing to put One Nation last, instead noting preferences would be decided after nominations closed and that the claim of no deals applied equally to Labor and the Greens. Queensland\u2019s LNP MPs, including Llew O\u2019Brien and Scott Buchholz, have urged the party to put the Greens, not One Nation, last, the New Daily reported. On Tuesday Morrison said \u201cthere will be no preference deals with One Nation\u201d. Labor noted that the same was said before the 2017 Queensland state election but the LNP had nevertheless preferenced One Nation ahead of Labor in 50 of 58 seats. On Wednesday Hanson said \u201ca couple of Liberal party sitting members\u201d had contacted her and were \u201cvery disgusted with the prime minister\u2019s comments\u201d. \u201cSo let\u2019s just see what happens when it gets closer to election time,\u201d she told Radio National. Hanson refused to name the MPs, but said \u201cthey\u2019ve been talking to One Nation for the last year and a half, two years, about preference deals\u201d. \u201cWhat do you think happened in Western Australia and in the Queensland state elections? They know they can\u2019t win their seats without One Nation\u2019s preferences.\u201d In 2017 the Liberals preferenced One Nation in the Western Australian election in a deal orchestrated by cabinet ministers Michaelia Cash and Mathias Cormann. Hanson accused the Coalition of falling \u201cinto the trap of the Labor party\u201d by attempting to isolate One Nation. \u201cI\u2019m not an extremist,\u201d she said. In this term of parliament Hanson has called for an end to Muslim migration, suggested Australia is being \u201cswamped by Muslims\u201d and wore a burqa into the Senate to call for the Muslim garment to be banned. Hanson said Labor and the Greens opposed Coalition policies most of the time but the government could work with \u201clike-minded\u201d parties on the crossbench. \u201cWhat I find amazing about this is the prime minister has accepted my vote on the floor of parliament quite readily,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s needed my vote \u2026 to have his legislation passed. \u201cI\u2019ve worked extremely well with the ministers and the prime minister and the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull [on] the legislation by the Coalition government \u2013 they\u2019ve been very good to work with.\u201d Asked if she would retaliate against Labor for putting One Nation last, Hanson said voters should \u201cselect what order you want\u201d, suggesting the minor party will run open tickets without directing preferences to either major party. On Wednesday Morrison clarified his remarks by noting that the Coalition did not do preference deals with One Nation, Labor or the Greens, leaving room for state branches to determine the order on how-to-vote cards after nominations close. The trade minister Simon Birmingham, now a leading moderate in the party, told ABC Radio that he expected \u201cextremists\u201d would be put last on Liberal how-to-vote cards, but declined to clarify whether One Nation should be put last. Asked if Fraser Anning and One Nation would rank behind Labor, he replied: \u201cWell I trust that we will be putting those of extremist positions at the bottom of the ticket and it\u2019s just a case of seeing which order you put the extremists in.\u201d O\u2019Brien told the New Daily he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule out putting the Greens last\u201d, citing their economic and drug policies as a cause for concern. Buchholz reportedly said that if asked by the state secretary, he would say the \u201cgreater risk to my electorate is the Greens\u201d. \u201cAs far as preferencing, I would put the Greens last,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think historically that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Labor shows no sign of dropping the issue, with Shorten on Wednesday afternoon reiterating his call to Morrison to put One Nation at the bottom of any how-to-vote card. \u201cFor too long people have been too quiet on this and so I say again today \u2013 this is a test of Mr Morrison\u2019s leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the two mainstream political movements of this country say enough is enough, time is up on the extremists, then they will continue to percolate, they will keep crawling out of the swamp of hatred which all too often some of their policies live in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
