The Bank of England\u2019s cut in interest rates on Thursday to a record low of 0.1% was actually the minor display of armoury. Far bigger was the \u00a3200bn expansion in quantitative easing, meaning the purchase of government debt and corporate bonds. It was an attempt to quell financial conditions that were \u201cbordering on disorderly\u201d, said Bank governor Andrew Bailey. Investors have been rushing for cash and dollars, making UK credit markets suddenly very tight, the last thing the crisis needs. The Bank\u2019s midafternoon intervention eased the pressure a little, but the next bazooka can only be unveiled by the government \u2013 measures to protect incomes and employment. The UK looks a laggard. France, Germany and Scandinavian countries have unveiled various schemes to protect laid-off workers, underwrite company wage bills and provide basic incomes. The Treasury\u2019s version is awaited \u2013 and cannot wait much longer. Nobody would pretend these schemes are easy to design. The degree of burden-sharing between the public purse and private balance sheets is a critical calculation. But speed is essential. Job losses are happening and the risk of a domino effect of business failures is obvious. The government can have a role as both \u201clender and employer of last resort\u201d, said Simon Wolfson, chief executive of clothing retailer Next. The latter role sounds startling, but he\u2019s right. In the banking crisis, the first job was to reassure savers that their money was safe; this time it\u2019s about giving confidence in jobs and income. Put another way, the really disorderly ingredient in the mix is people\u2019s confidence in how they will pay their bills. Intervention on pay and livelihoods must happen \u201cwithin days\u201d, said the CBI. Correct. Next can \u2018comfortably sustain\u2019 \u00a31bn loss in Gloria Gaynor mode Still on Next, one could call it the moment when UK plc switched to Gloria Gaynor mode. Amid the tide of profit warnings and cancelled financial forecasts, quoted companies primarily sought to reassure shareholders that they will survive. Next scored well in the credibility stakes, which was predictable. Wolfson is one of the few FTSE 100 chief executives who was in post during the 2008 financial crash and he also knows the power of a worked-up financial model. He\u2019s produced stress tests in the past that tackled a no-deal Brexit and online retailing, but this was different. It was a mitigation plan to demonstrate how cash can be conserved during the inevitable whack to revenues as customers conclude they don\u2019t need to wear a new outfit while hibernating. In short, Next reckons it can \u201ccomfortably sustain\u201d the loss of \u00a31bn of full-price sales, a year-on-year drop of 25%, without breaching bank or bond covenants. Capital expenditure can be cut, share buybacks suspended, dividends delayed and so on. Other companies, especially non-food retailers, should take note. Stress tests are genuinely useful for shareholders and every numerical detail creates a small degree of confidence for employees. Plan beats no plan. CEO of easyJet defends \u00a3170m shareholder dividend Executives would help their case for bailouts if they didn\u2019t sound quite so entitled. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, when asked on BBC radio why he hasn\u2019t cancelled a shareholder dividend worth \u00a3170m now that the airline is in cash-preservation mode, replied that the payment is \u201clegally binding\u201d because it has been approved by shareholders. His answer dodged the question of why, since airlines have been in the eye of the storm for a few weeks, easyJet\u2019s board didn\u2019t seek shareholder approval to undo the dividend. Instead, millions are being dispatched to Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou in Monaco (he and his family own 34% of easyJet) while the company seeks assistance from the UK public purse. Lundgren\u2019s answer on that point was that easyJet is merely requesting loans from government on commercial terms. Well, yes, but \u201ccommercial\u201d is a slippery concept right now. Not many commercial lenders are rushing to lend to airlines at any rate of interest. One can see, of course, what Lundgren\u2019s getting at: the UK will need an airline industry and, for all the reasons above, the government urgently needs to support employment. But the tone-deafness suggests not all boardrooms have yet grasped that life has changed overnight for them. By contrast, bus and coach operator National Express at least announced a pay \u201cdeferral and sacrifice\u201d plans for its executives. That\u2019s the spirit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
