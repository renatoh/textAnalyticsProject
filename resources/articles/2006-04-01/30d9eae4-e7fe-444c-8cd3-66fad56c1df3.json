The former journalist, who took over from Craig Levein in a caretaker role when the Scot was dismissed in late January, has become the overwhelming favourite to lead Leicester into next season after transforming their fortunes during the past three months. The Leicester board had been reluctant to discuss who should replace Levein amid the threat of relegation, though victory over Crystal Palace on Friday night combined with Saturday's results meant that any fears of slipping into League One have been assuaged. Ian Holloway, currently on gardening leave from QPR, and Mike Newell, the Luton Town manager, have been strongly linked with the vacancy though Kelly's success has propelled him to the top of the pecking order. Leicester occupied a place in the bottom three and their status as a Championship club was shrouded in doubt when Kelly replaced Levein. However, a run of seven victories and three draws from 12 matches has seen Leicester pick up 24 points and climb up to 16th place in the table. That sequence has also galvanised the supporters who chanted Kelly's name throughout the win over Palace. Kelly, who played for Leicester in the 80s before later becoming a journalist on a regional newspaper, initially sought to play down his prospects of supplanting Levein though he has since conceded that he would be disappointed if the board decided to look elsewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
