It is a result that leaves Hearts six points ahead of the champions in the race to discover which of them will lay claim to the Scottish Premierleague's remaining Champions League qualifying slot. Emotions were still running high after the final whistle when the Rangers striker Kris Boyd questioned the mental strength of the Edinburgh club as they face a daunting run-in that includes visits to Ibrox, Parkhead and Easter Road. \"They'll obviously drop points,\" he said. \"They've never been in this position before and once they have to come to Glasgow and win we'll see how they handle it. They were 16 points clear of us and now that's down to six. We feel the mental side of things will play a big part between now and May and our team won the title on the final day last year. We're used to dealing with pressure.\" Yesterday's opening goal was a breathless mixture of audacity and tenacity. Deividas Cesnauskis was surrounded by two opponents when Steven Pressley's clearance reached him on the right touchline. A dip of his left shoulder and a flick with the outside of his right boot left Paul Hartley scampering into the space where Ian Murray should have been. Hartley might have shot himself but he had the presence of mind to assess his options before unselfishly squaring for the unmarked Edgaras Jankauskas to force the ball home from point-blank range. Alex McLeish's decision to deploy Dado Prso wide on the Rangers left was a major factor in Hearts' early ascendancy. It took 40 minutes for that tactical error to be addressed and Rangers failed to register a single effort on target during the first half. Prso should have taken no further part from the 48th minute when, with his arm raised, he hit Pressley late and high in an aerial challenge. The referee Craig Thomson, who had a lamentable afternoon, chose only to caution the striker, who escaped without further censure for a later lunge at Robbie Neilson. Hearts' director of football Jim Duffy was guarded about the incident. \"There was one particular challenge that was a wee bit contentious but the referee makes these calls and you just get on with it,\" he said. \"When you get big matches you prefer to talk about the football but I think unfortunately there will be quite a lot of talk about the official.\" The home side were guilty of defending too deeply, though, and though Craig Gordon kept them in front with an outstanding save from Thomas Buffel's volley they paid the price for their reticence in the 65th minute when Chris Burke's cross to the far post was steered home by the Belgian. Burke should have put the visitors in front but mishit his shot from six yards after Boyd had set him up. Hearts, though, could point to a 30-yard drive from Neilson that hit the bar five minutes from time. McLeish, for his part, was confident second spot and a Champions League place can still be clinched. \"The way the second half went I was disappointed not to have won,\" he said. \"We had fought back really well, passed it better and made chances. The gap can be bridged.\" The Hearts captain Pressley was just as confident. \"Whose position would you rather be in?\" he asked. \"I'd rather have the lead.\" The scene is set.
