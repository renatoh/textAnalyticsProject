American comic Kevin James Doyle has secured an Amazon Prime Video special with The 30 Year Old Virgin, a show that debuted on the Edinburgh fringe and relates his adventures in celibacy. Or does it? The set begins with an account of Doyle\u2019s religious upbringing in the midwest, and is performed in a New York church, placing its theme of religious sexual abstinence further front and centre. But much of the show \u2013 too much \u2013 has nothing to do with Doyle\u2019s virginity whatsoever. He tees up the subject well, with an opening that stars his sweet-natured, holier-than-thou parents and their substitute swear words, and recalls young Kevin having to ask his schoolmates what \u201cjerking off\u201d was all about. But the central section veers off course, relaying at length Doyle\u2019s engagement, \u201cpremarital counselling\u201d and breakup, and his worship of the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. It\u2019s amusing enough, as Doyle wonders whether to weaponise an outdoor drinking charge against his ex-fiancee. But it\u2019s unrelated to the story he\u2019s meant to be telling \u2013 to the extent that he glaringly omits to address the question of his sexual relationship (or lack of it) with his partner of two years\u2019 standing. It all comes around in the end as, one hour into the show, we see for the first time Doyle having to negotiate a sexual encounter. With alarming consequences, that foreground the downsides of being raised in ignorance of sexual behaviour. Not that our host considers that too deeply. The show stays wry and autobiographical, intensely interested in the detail of Doyle\u2019s romantic relationships but not at all in the equally dysfunctional relationship between sex and the church more widely. We\u2019re left with a slick 80 minutes of standup storytelling, scripted to the hilt, with callbacks in all the right places and some choice gags: the one about compromise, at the moment his relationship expires, is very fine. The closing section, with its carnal tragicomedy and emotional intimacies, is particularly compelling \u2013 not least because it returns us, at last, to the show we were meant to be getting all along. \u2022 Available on Amazon Prime Video."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
