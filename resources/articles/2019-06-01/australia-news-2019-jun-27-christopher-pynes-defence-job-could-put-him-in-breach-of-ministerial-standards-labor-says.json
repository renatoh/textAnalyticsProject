EY announced on Wednesday that the former defence minister would be joining its ranks to help grow its defence business, little more than a month after he left office. The decision makes Pyne the latest in a long line of former ministers \u2013 both Labor and Liberal \u2013 quickly taking jobs in industries they previously held portfolio responsibility for. The decision has prompted concern from some within the defence community, who are concerned that ministers do not have to comply with rules that apply to others leaving the Australian Defence Force. Senior military officers and public servants are usually barred for 12 months from taking private work that could be relevant to their prior roles within defence. The rules, though not well enforced, are designed to stop the use of inside information or contacts obtained in the military for private gain. The Australia Defence Association, an independent watchdog that monitors issues of national security and defence, said ministers should be subject to the same forced 12-month embargo period. \u201cThe ADA remains uncomfortable with the growing tradition of ministers leaving and being employed in industries closely connected to their duties as a minister,\u201d the association\u2019s executive director, Neil James, told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd our longstanding policy is that public servants, defence personnel, and members of parliament and ministers, should be held to the same quarantine periods. There shouldn\u2019t be a lower one for ministers.\u201d There are other rules designed to stop former ministers going immediately into paid employment related directly to their past portfolio. The ministerial standards say ministers should not \u201clobby, advocate or have business meetings with members of the government\u201d on any matter which they have had official dealings with in the past 18 months, and should not take advantage of information they had special access to in office.

Even then, the punishments for breaching standards are only really applicable to sitting members. Labor believes Pyne\u2019s new role could place him in breach of the standards. Jones told Sky News that Pyne\u2019s new job was \u201cdirectly related to his ministerial responsibilities\u201d. \u201cWe wish him well in his post-politics career, but what\u2019s gone on here seems to be a breach of the government\u2019s own ministerial code of conduct. \u201cMost Australians would say that is not on, that is not right,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere should be a healthy break between your ministerial life and jumping into the private sector and working directly in an area you were once a decision maker on.\u201d The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said Morrison must intervene. He said Morrison should call Pyne directly or direct defence to cease engaging EY on contracts. \u201cMy view on this is that this happens and it happens and it happens, and it will continue to happen until we have a PM that steps on it,\u201d Patrick told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s the place where this stops. If he doesn\u2019t act, it will show poor leadership and will undermine his own integrity.\u201d Guardian Australia has approached Pyne for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
