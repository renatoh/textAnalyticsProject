Those that attempt to lie awake at night knowing that every time we see them making all the right faces while just praying someone calls \"Cut!\" so they can shake off their grim little mannerisms like a wet coat we hate them even more than we already did. So, for instance, how much do you think the Christmas kitchen we see in Nigella's Christmas Kitchen (Wed, 8pm, BBC2) resembles Nigella Lawson's actual kitchen at Christmas? I would be willing to suggest it's so little it's potentially libellous. When she gasps quietly, licks her lips and breathes, \"indulge me,\" over some slow motion CREAM falling off a SPOON (do you see what they did there) did not one single person in the editing suite have the balls to shout, \"Hang on a minute, she looks stupid! We can't transmit this crap! People will hate us even more than they already do!\" \"Nigella\" is one of the great TV constructs of our times, but, and there's no nice way of saying this, \"Nigella\" is a construct that's past its best. The coquettish glances to camera have begun to look a little absurd while the director chooses to blur her lower half - his one stab at immortality - in the brief moments we see her move presumably in order to preserve the sizeable dignity of her bottom. Lawson is still an attractive woman, but the format - your ultimate Christmas party guide! - is so tired it can barely stand. At one point a gang of rent-a-crowd \"gal pals\" pick at poussin in that overly-delicate way only women who know they're being filmed ever eat and it's painful to watch. \"I don't think my friends would come over if they didn't know they were going to get my crab cakes spritzed (spritzed!) with lime,\" our host quivers at one point. But of course they will come as they, as clearly as Nigella, are getting paid to pretend they like this crap. If Heston Blumenthal didn't exist we could build a fairly good approximation of him by arming a child with an old photo of Judge Jules and a baked potato. He means it so much it hurts, though not as much as it hurt me when I had dinner at The Fat Duck and he served me \u00a3300 worth of warmed over badger dribble. However, his show, Heston Blumenthal: In Search Of Perfection (Tue, 8.30pm, BBC2) is righteously full of passion for this week's subject, spaghetti bolognese. Blumenthal wants to \"take the dish to the next level\" and in doing so, travels to Italy to eat the most traditional version imaginable and another one served inside a fertilised chicken embryo. \"That's brilliant!\" he gurns like a Thunderbird on the vinegar strokes as he chews down the latter. And it is, sort of, but, duh!, there's no such thing as perfection in something as subjective in food as Blumenthal discovers when he tries his three versions of the dish (boring, classic and \"next level\") on the resolutely posh customers of his restaurant. Guess what? They like them all just about the same. The fact is, they're all nice. \"Just another two hours to go!\" he yelps over his Space 1999 specs as his own spag bol enters its ninth hour of cooking. Blumenthal is funny and likable and full of wild enthusiasm, but there's not a fibre of your being that desires even a mouthful of his endlessly mucked around with food. I met Oz Clarke once. He was as pissed as fuck. Anyway, Oz And James's Big Wine Adventure (Wed, 8.30pm, BBC2) features the bald oenophile and his long-haired, gangly mate May from Top Gear farting about France, tooling around in a 1980s Jag, getting bladdered in some of the country's finest cellars and gazing longingly at unattainably attractive (generally bra-free) French women. It is genius television, invoking the medium's oldest format - expert bangs on about chosen subject in pleasant surroundings - while pricking any potential pomposity by removing the grumpy bloke shouting \"Bollocks!\" from the home sofa and placing him right there on the screen. If you turned the cameras off, Clarke and May - like Heston, but unlike \"Nigella\" - would still be doing this. And you know why? Passion. You can't fake it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
