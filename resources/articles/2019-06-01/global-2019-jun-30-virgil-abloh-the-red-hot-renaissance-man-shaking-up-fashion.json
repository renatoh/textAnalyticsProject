It is, naturally, no ordinary brick. It\u2019s flag-down-a-passing-aircraft orange, and prominently branded in an edition of just 999. But, crucially, the brick \u2013 or \u201cceramic block\u201d as its parents have christened it \u2013 has been designed by Virgil Abloh, a 38-year-old from Chicago, in conjunction with the timeless Swiss furniture company Vitra. Right now, Abloh is an alchemist: anything he touches in the worlds of fashion and design turns to gold (or often orange). The people jostling in this queue know that they could buy a brick and own a cherished piece of design history \u2013 or walk out and resell it immediately for at least double what they paid. And yet, it really does look like a brick. Abloh, whose day job is artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, makes no wild claims for its utility. \u201cIt is sort of reminiscent of a cinder block, which is obviously a building unit to build structures such as we\u2019re in,\u201d he says, at the launch at Vitra\u2019s headquarters. \u201cBut we decided to make that a ceramic household accessory. It gets adapted to your living space as an object itself, or it can be a paperweight, or it can hold objects within it.\u201d The brick is, in many ways, a perfect leitmotif for Abloh\u2019s game-changing and divisive career to date. For those who are unconvinced by him, his main talents are in orchestrating hype and self-promotion. One of his often-quoted maxims is that you only need to change a design by 3% to make it fresh and original, and he made his name originally by applying this logic to graphic T-shirts, hoodies and sneakers. In GQ, the author Michael Chabon described Abloh as \u201cone-third hip-hop, one-third hustle, one-third [Malcolm] McLarenesque inside joke\u201d. For others, though \u2013 and it\u2019s an army that is beginning to drown out the doubters \u2013 Abloh is nothing less than a new Marcel Duchamp, the Andy Warhol for our times. His work is reliably playful, ironic and totally unreverential: one of his signatures is to add a lurid zip-tie to Nike sneakers. In March, Justin Bieber was stopped by police, who thought he still had a store security tag on his Air Max 90s. \u201cVirgil, my God, bro,\u201d Bieber posted on Instagram. \u201cYou freaking \u2013 you\u2019re killing me, man!\u201d Other trademarks are horizontal stripes, quotation marks, brash capital letters in Helvetica type. You\u2019ll see them everywhere now: Kendall Jenner, Drake, Beyonc\u00e9, Serena Williams. Abloh is also a pioneer, a relentless polymath. In March 2018, he became Louis Vuitton\u2019s first African-American artistic director, and a rare black designer in the fashion establishment. His streetwear label Off-White, founded in 2012, is neck and neck with Gucci as the \u201chottest\u201d brand in the world, according to the influential Lyst Index. He\u2019s lectured at Harvard and the Architectural Association in London, and had a series of exhibitions at the Gagosian galleries with cult artist Takashi Murakami. The New Yorker recently called Abloh \u201cmenswear\u2019s biggest star\u201d; last year, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. What Abloh taps into is a generation \u2013 millennials, essentially \u2013 who, until recently, have been ignored as serious consumers. His reach is shown most conspicuously by his Instagram followers, of whom there are 4.1m. This makes him tremendously desirable for established companies looking for a jab of Botox. Ikea has commissioned him to design a range of products, available from November. When, in May, the homewares giant \u201cdropped\u201d a rug from the collection \u2013 a grey and black wool-nylon blend with \u201cKEEP OFF\u201d across the middle \u2013 it sold out in a finger-click. It\u2019s a version of this frenzy that I\u2019m witnessing at Vitra. The company \u2013 the European manufacturer of the designs of Charles and Ray Eames, Verner Panton and Jean Prouv\u00e9 \u2013 has worked with Abloh on three new designs: the ceramic block and two \u201chacks\u201d of classic Prouv\u00e9 designs, the Antony chair and the Petit Potence wall lamp. There\u2019s a commercial aspect to the collaboration but, for Abloh, that\u2019s not the most exciting part. He sees the Virgil Abloh c/o Vitra project as an opportunity to reach and inspire a young person \u2013 in his head, aged 14 to 17 \u2013 who has never heard of Prouv\u00e9 and probably has no interest in design. So it\u2019s a brick, sure, but maybe for the neophyte it\u2019s also a way into an intimidating, expensive world. \u201cDesign is often something the general public doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s broke,\u201d says Abloh. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice a door handle until it doesn\u2019t work. You don\u2019t think about the history related to architecture, cars or phones \u2013 you just use them. Whereas I think we would all benefit from having a knowledge of design. At least that\u2019s the premise that I operate under.\u201d Abloh is a big man with a gentle manner. He doesn\u2019t often crack a smile this afternoon, but you can tell when he\u2019s into an idea by the fact that his speech cadence, usually languid, quickens. He has offices in Paris, Milan and London, homes in Paris and Chicago, but no desk anywhere. His design work is mainly done on two phones that sit between us as we speak. I\u2019d love to say that our conversation is so compelling that they remain untouched, but that isn\u2019t the case. A sound engineer records our exchange for Abloh\u2019s \u201carchive\u201d. The Abloh story starts in suburban Rockford, Illinois in 1980. His mother Eunice and father Nee, Ghanaian immigrants to America in the 1970s, were respectively a seamstress and a manager of a paint company. As a teenager, Abloh was into skateboarding, soccer and graffiti but, looking back, his greatest inspiration was hip-hop. And he sees obvious parallels with critiques of his design work. \u201cHip-hop\u2019s a music form that\u2019s made by sampling a soul or jazz record and making a completely new genre,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could argue, \u2018Is it music or not?\u2019 But you can say now that it\u2019s the number one [genre] in music.\u201d Abloh is not, by most accepted definitions, actually a millennial himself: most have that category starting with a 1982 birthdate. Certainly his academic career followed a more traditional Generation X path. His parents wanted him to learn a trade, so he studied first civil engineering and then trained as an architect. His heroes were an eclectic crew: Kanye West, Rem Koolhaas, Pharrell Williams and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The story goes that he engineered a meeting with West by finding out where the rapper screen-printed his merchandise in Chicago. Now, he says that they probably would have run into each other anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re from the same city, so it\u2019s a small circle.\u201d Either way, they clicked and, for a decade from the mid-2000s, they worked on projects together (Abloh is sometimes called West\u2019s creative director). When, in 2009, West decided to slum it as an intern at the fashion house Fendi in Rome for six months \u2013 with a salary of \u00a3400 a month \u2013 Abloh tagged along. Not many make the jump from intern to artistic director, but Abloh\u2019s ascent tells you what a crazy journey the fashion industry has been on in the past few years. Today, under-35s drive more than 50% of the revenue at some of the top fashion labels and streetwear is mainstream. \u201cFor sure, I bet on it,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a career out of it. When I was showing in fashion week, people were saying, \u2018That\u2019s not fashion.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t referred to as a fashion designer.\u201d Abloh is sometimes described as a dilettante, but he points out that nothing he\u2019s achieved has been easy. \u201cMy career had been 15 years long and there\u2019s only been people paying attention for the last three,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this exact amount of work and type of work for a long time. It\u2019s the life of a designer and artist that not everything works, but when everyone\u2019s watching hopefully it\u2019s working.\u201d In 2019, everyone\u2019s watching, everything\u2019s working. On the day we meet, Abloh has flown into Switzerland from Chicago, where the Museum of Contemporary Art is staging a career-spanning retrospective: he is, to confirm, 38 years old. His latest collections for Off-White and Louis Vuitton were presented at Paris Fashion Week this month (his LV jamboree, which featured floral harnesses, Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and a red bouncy castle, was \u201cthe standout show\u201d of the week, said W Magazine). He\u2019s had to finish off this project with Vitra and go back and forth with Ikea. Most of us, it\u2019s safe to say, wouldn\u2019t last five minutes as Virgil Abloh. The reason for this punishing pace is that he loves what he does and perhaps knows that this is his time. \u201cI feel like now is a tremendous time in culture,\u201d he says, at the Vitra launch. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s the Renaissance. I feel like Bernini just sculpting away, defining a moment of enlightenment. I\u2019m just an eager kid who looks at every day as a possibility to make something and leave a good impact.\u201d Abloh\u2019s private life is mainly that \u2013 private \u2013 but we know he is married to Shannon Sundberg, whom he met in high school, and they have two young children, Lowe and Grey. It\u2019s been estimated that he\u2019s on the road 320 days a year \u2013 \u201ca myth,\u201d he counters \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t deny he has to be obsessive about his work. \u201cAny person you can cite: Steve Jobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Michael Jordan \u2013 they are not common names because they did it nine-to-five,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people on Earth that dedicate themselves to their practice or whatever. I\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d In his staff, Abloh looks for and expects a similar work ethic. At Vitra, he notes that he makes most of his hires straight from social media. \u201cIf you have an awesome Instagram, I\u2019ll follow you, DM you and say, \u2018Hey, do you want a job?\u2019 And if you are self-motivated, you\u2019re going to get promoted in two seconds because that\u2019s ultimately the shot I wanted when I was a kid.\u201d Working at this speed also means that Abloh doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about how people (especially trolls) are responding to what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s adamant that his gaze is set 30 years down the line, not at the comments on an Instagram post. As he puts it: \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for someone else to tell me what grade I get on it.\u201d And how does he feel about his work reselling for inflated multiples of their original price? Another shrug. \u201cLike on my list of things to worry about\u2026 I can\u2019t control it,\u201d Abloh replies. \u201cI\u2019m just the creator of the idea, the company is more in control.\u201d On the evidence of his Vitra project \u2013 whether Abloh is interested or not \u2013 he appears to have another hit. The range sold out in days, and it does seem to have initiated a conversation about design among a new crowd. At the end of a public talk he gave at the Vitra Campus, the stage was mobbed by teens and 20-somethings, many of whom were standing in their socks, thrusting up sneakers for Abloh to sign. \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star!\u201d says a design writer that I\u2019m sitting next to. It\u2019s definitely hard to think of another contemporary designer who would inspire such a response \u2013 even harder to name one who would later play a 90-minute DJ set, until 12.30am, at the Vitra summer party (unexpected highlight: Journey\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.) Of course, Abloh\u2019s designs will likely never be for everyone \u2013 perhaps inevitably for someone who confronts, and affronts, the status quo so directly. At Basel airport the next day, I try to put one of his cinder blocks through the X-ray machine. The security officer looks bemused and pulls me aside for clarification. \u201cFran\u00e7ais, Deutsch, English?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I explain to him that it\u2019s a ceramic design object. He takes a knife, slices the tape on the cardboard packaging. I\u2019m travelling with a PR and he opens Abloh\u2019s Instagram page, showing the brick in situ. The image already has 40,000 likes. The security man\u2019s expression is unchanged: he picks up the brick, spins it around in his hand, puts it back and waves me through without comment. There will be another drop of Virgil Abloh c/o Vitra this autumn. Visit vitra.com for more information"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
