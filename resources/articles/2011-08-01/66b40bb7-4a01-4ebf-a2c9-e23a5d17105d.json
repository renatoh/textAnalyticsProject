The precedents are not encouraging, with England's football international against Holland at Wembley being postponed after the Football Association said it could not guarantee the safety of players and fans, alongside three Carling Cup ties in London, while the weekend's start of the new Premier League season remains in the balance. Richard Sumray, the MPA's lead officer for the 2012 Games, admitted: \"It is extremely worrying. There's an issue around the moral compass of some of these young people. We need to find ways of alleviating the problem.\" The International Olympic Committee said it was confident that the Olympics would be secure, though it made clear that responsibility for a safe Games lay with the British government and Metropolitan police. It said: \"Security at the Olympic Games is a top priority for the IOC. It is, however, directly handled by the local authorities, as they know best what is appropriate and proportionate. We are confident they will do a good job in this domain.\" However, officials said there were no immediate plans to review security for the Olympics, which start next July, though there was an acceptance that London's image has been damaged and visitors may be deterred from attending the games. The assistant commissioner, Chris Allison, the national Olympic security co-ordinator, said: \"Our planning for security is intelligence led. Public disorder is one of those risks which we have already been planning against across the country. Obviously, in light of the appalling events in London over recent days, we will review our planning to ensure that any lessons are identified. At this time it is too early to say whether our planning will significantly change.\" Hugh Robertson, the Olympics minister, said that anyone sceptical about security arrangements for the Games would be \"very wrong. All the evidence shows this trouble is low-level criminality driven by messages on social networks and not some new, emerging security threat.\" A spokesperson for the London mayor, Boris Johnson, said: \"The mayor remains totally committed to staging the best ever Olympic and Paralympic Games and welcoming the world in the summer of 2012. We continually discuss and review security arrangements for the Games with the Metropolitan police, the Home Office and Locog [the organising body]. While lessons will, of course, be learned from the awful events of the last few days, the mayor is in no doubt that London will put on a fantastic show next year.\" A test event was carried out on Tuesday, beach volleyball at Horse Guards Parade, but the finish was brought forward by 90 minutes to ensure it was completed in daylight and so avoid any riot-related trouble. Other test events to go ahead include the Surrey Cycle Classic on Sunday, a test event for the cycling road race which will go through the streets of London, and the marathon swimming event in Hyde Park on Saturday. A London 2012 spokeswoman said: \"A lot of detailed work has taken place regarding security plans for the Games and we will continue to review them together with the Met police and the Home Office over the coming year.\" The British Olympic Association director of communications, Darryl Seibel, said he was confident that the Games would be safe. He said: \"It makes an Olympic Games and a Paralympic Games all the more important. We need a reason to come together. What better city to do it in than London. This is not a reflection of London, this is a reflection of the world we live in today.\" Views were mixed over whether the image of London had been damaged in the eyes of visitors intending to come to the Games. Mary Rance, chief executive of UKinbound, the tourism trade association, said: \"The riots of the past few days, particularly in London, are most unfortunate for the global image of the UK.\" However, Tom Jenkins, the European Tour Operators Association executive director, felt that the images of looting would soon fade. \"I don't think the rioting will impact the Olympics,\" he said. \"The Olympics is, overwhelmingly, a domestic event. British people won't be put off from visiting the Olympics in Stratford because a year earlier shop windows were broken in Hackney.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
