Bannon has recently been in Europe, seeking to boost populism across the continent. But judging by The Best People: Trump\u2019s Cabinet and the Siege on Washington, a book by Alexander Nazaryan of Yahoo News which will be published next week, he could soon be on his way back to Washington. The Guardian obtained a copy. Like Michael Wolff\u2019s pair of books about the Trump campaign and White House, The Best People is heavily reliant on interviews with Bannon, demonstrating the former adviser\u2019s continued influence in crafting public perceptions of Trump and Trumpism. Last year, Bannon was banished from circles close to Trump after, among other things, he called the president\u2019s eldest daughter \u201cdumb as a brick\u201d and his eldest son \u201ctreasonous\u201d in Wolff\u2019s first book, Fire and Fury. But Nazaryan reveals that just in time for what looks to be a desperate re-election fight, and notwithstanding Bannon\u2019s controversial comments to Wolff for his new book, Siege, Bannon appears to have returned to Trump\u2019s good graces. In an interview with Trump carried out in February 2019, Nazaryan asks the president if he would rehire Bannon, a former Breitbart News executive who has extolled the political usefulness of anger and fear, for his 2020 campaign. Trump \u201calmost welcomed\u201d the idea, Nazaryan writes. \u201cI watched Bannon a few times, four or five times over the last six months,\u201d Trump is quoted as saying. \u201cNobody says anything better about me right now than Bannon \u2026 I will say this. Bannon, there is nobody that has been more respectful of the job I\u2019m doing than Steve Bannon.\u201d After Fire and Fury, Trump declared Bannon had \u201clost his mind\u201d and the billionaire Breitbart backer Rebekah Mercer dumped Bannon as a beneficiary, leading to him losing his post at Breitbart. But Trump has also shown an elastic ability to make nice with former antagonists, from Ted Cruz to Kim Jong-un, particularly if they are willing to praise him in public. In March, Bannon delivered a memorable reaction to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s submission of his report on Russian election interference, links between Trump and Moscow and potential obstruction of justice by the president. \u201cIt looks like they have nothing,\u201d Bannon told Yahoo, predicting that Trump was \u201cgoing to go full animal \u2026 come off the chains\u201d and \u201cuse it [the Mueller report] to bludgeon\u201d his political enemies. A return by Bannon could be politically significant. He has been credited with helping Trump sell voters on a dark vision of encroaching national apocalypse, an \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in the phrasing of the inaugural address Bannon co-wrote, deliverance from which only Trump can provide. In the acknowledgments to Siege, Wolff calls Bannon \u201cthe man arguably most responsible for making [Trump] president\u201d, a \u201cDr Frankenstein\u201d nursing \u201cdeep ambivalence about the monster he created\u201d and \u201cthe Virgil anyone might be lucky to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld\u201d. In fact, Bannon remains in professional limbo and his remarks about Trump in Siege, including suggesting the Trump Organization could be described as \u201ccriminal\u201d, may have steered his relationship with the president back towards the rocks. But Wolff\u2019s descriptors are suited to Bannon\u2019s grandiose sense of his might and mission. \u201cI\u2019ve got my hands back on my weapons,\u201d he said after leaving the White House in August 2017. \u201cI built a fucking machine at Breitbart. And now I\u2019m about to go back, knowing what I know, and we\u2019re about to rev that machine up. And rev it up we will do.\u201d Bannon left Breitbart but he remains capable of loosing off damaging shots. The Best People presents his version of Chris Christie\u2019s work on the Trump transition, which has been presented favourably by the former New Jersey governor in his own book, Let Me Finish, and by the bestselling writer Michael Lewis. Famously, Bannon was given the job of firing Christie. Nazarayan quotes Bannon trashing Christie\u2019s transition plans as the work of aides he describes as \u201cthe New Jersey mafia\u201d and wondering if the former governor\u2019s aggrieved reaction to being fired shows him to be \u201cpsychologically fucked up\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s not an adult in the way he thinks about things,\u201d Bannon is quoted as saying. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s so grossly overweight or if it\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something that is psychologically not right with this guy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
