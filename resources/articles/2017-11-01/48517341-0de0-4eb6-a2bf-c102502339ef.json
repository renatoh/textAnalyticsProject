The changes provoked by a demoralising defeat at Tottenham Hotspur have underpinned an emphatic reaction, however, and face the fiercest examination since Wembley on Tuesday against Sevilla. Liverpool arrived in Andalusia in punishing form, flushing memories of Spurs out of the system by winning their last four games by an aggregate score of 13-1. A fifth consecutive victory would secure a place in the Champions League knock-out stage with a group game to spare. It would also be a significant statement, given that Sevilla have not lost at the Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n since 22 November 2016 when they were beaten 3-1 by Juventus. \u201cIt has been a really interesting journey in the Champions League so far,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cBut this is the game.\u201d The Liverpool squad flew without the injured Jo\u00ebl Matip but with a sense of defensive security unimaginable one month ago. Liverpool\u2019s two league defeats this season, the 4-1 at Spurs and 5-0 at Manchester City, have inflated their goals against tally to 16 away from home \u2013 the division\u2019s worst \u2013 and helped maintain the narrative of a vulnerable rearguard. Yet the defeat of Southampton on Saturday brought a fifth clean sheet in six Premier League home games this season and further evidence of a more defensive approach adopted by Klopp since Wembley. It will be required again in Spain, where a draw will be sufficient for Liverpool to qualify if Spartak Moscow lose to Maribor. Defeat, and an expected home win in Moscow, would leave everything riding on the Russian club\u2019s visit to Anfield on 6 December. \u201cTottenham wasn\u2019t a good game,\u201d said Ragnar Klavan, who should retain his place against Sevilla. \u201cBut after that we made our corrections and the last four games have been good. Everyone realised that we have to do everything together. We have a lot of quality in attack and we know for sure that the players in front are going to get chances in every game. It has always been defence first and then attack and the manager has always tried to tell us that. But maybe in recent games he has put a little bit more emphasis on that.\u201d Klopp has not abandoned any football principles to implement change, as Southampton, West Ham United, Maribor and Huddersfield Town can testify, and he is reluctant to divulge too many tactical secrets. Gameplans remain tailored to the opponent but the manager said: \u201cThere were a lot of things we changed to make us more stable.\u201d Sitting deeper at West Ham and curbing the attacking instincts of his full-backs, the former Sevilla player Alberto Moreno and Trent Alexander-Arnold, against Southampton were, he admits, part of the pursuit of stability. \u201cWe had two or three situations where it was an individual problem,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIn all the other parts it was a team problem. Huddersfield was similar to West Ham. Huddersfield had no counterattacks and while people might say they didn\u2019t want to counterattack that is not true, they wanted to. That was the first really important step for us. \u201cFor the West Ham game, with the knowledge of what West Ham had to do at home, we decided to sit back more. It was really difficult for the boys. That was different. With a 4-4, and we have this pretty much all the time even if we play 4-3-3, in a lot of defending situations we have this 4-4-1-1. That is how it should be. On this day it was a little bit more clear because of the lineup and because of the three outstandingly quick players. We can\u2019t always play like this but it is an opportunity and that is cool. We never hesitate to do different things, it is only that we need time for it. \u201cWith the full-backs, it\u2019s a waste of potential if we keep them back all the time. When I was a full back and I passed the halfway line, I was shot, but now you do it differently, you have the half-space, you have the \u2018eight\u2019, they have to move with the formation. Against Southampton we did it a little bit differently, it was more about the midfield. We built a little bit more up with the midfield, our full-backs were real wingers and our wingers were in the half-space. But it depends on the opponent.\u201d What has not altered is Klopp\u2019s belief that defending, collectively and individually, starts in the head. He said: \u201cDefending is about being focused. It is not a quality problem. Focus on a situation. When we have the ball be an option to receive it or, if you cannot be an option, give protection. Simple as that. It is not about counter-pressing all the time. Yes, if we can counter-press, then do it. If not, go back and defend together. That is the thing we have lacked in one or two games and I think, and I hope, that we are now a step further in this. Our \u2018new\u2019 maturity we will have to show 100% in this atmosphere tomorrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
