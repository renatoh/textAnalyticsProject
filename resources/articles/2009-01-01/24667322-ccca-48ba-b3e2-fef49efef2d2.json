Finesse was not present for much of this afternoon and in its absence the fastest, most lively team triumphed. It is not an age thing \u2013 35-year-old Ryan Giggs was as energetic and alert as anyone \u2013 it's a question of mentality and in that regard Chelsea looked jaded and stale. Michael Ballack and Deco were as lethargic as they have been for most of the season, and Joe Cole was doddery. This season they have revelled on the road by absorbing blunt pressure and springing sharply forward, but United's speed and dynamism \u2013 and certainly not their passing, which was often as erratic as Chelsea's \u2013 meant the visitors could not rely on that approach. Chelsea's grumpiness was compounded by some strange refereeing by Howard Webb - who gave only a short Sunday sermon to Wayne Rooney after the striker crassly kicked Ashley Cole up the backside in the 25th minute but then booked Jose Bosingwa for a far less mean-spirited tackle on Rooney less than 60 seconds later. And the more cantankerous the Pensioners got, the less they focused on their own ailing game. Ballack took to falling over, Didier Drogba to bleating and gesticulating and Luiz Felipe Scolari to waving imaginary yellow cards. No Chelsea player showed the sort of nimble thinking that United demonstrated just before the break. The canny corner routine worked by Rooney and Giggs proved that United remain as mentally agile in training as they can be in matches. They have a similar trick they sometimes use at free-kicks, whereby two United players deliberately bump into each other as if neither knew the other was going to take it and then, as the defence drop their guard to mock the apparent mix-up, United quickly deliver. This time, alas, they were thwarted because the officials were as sluggish as their opponents, but Chelsea did not have the alacrity to use the reprieve to reorganise and John Terry found himself attempting to mark two opponents when the more conventional re-take was delivered and Nemanja Vidic headed into the net. Whatever Scolari said at half-time had no discernible effect. Bosingwa looked befuddled and almost disinterested as he allowed Patrice Evra and Cristiano Ronaldo to effortlessly forge space for the former to cross for United's second and both Berbatov \u2013 who missed his header - and Rooney beat dozing defenders to the ball. Thereafter, rather than rally, Chelsea got ever more ragged. The ease with which Berbatov poked into the net when unmarked four yards from goal was symptomatic of a deep malaise. Chelsea urgently need new blood, not merely to provide Scolari with more options but also to stimulate a listless team. Their problem is, however, that Roman Abramovich's appetite also appears to have waned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
