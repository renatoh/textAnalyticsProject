That is actually a mild way of putting the view of Pete and Zak on the gum-spotted pavement where the chase of Sarfraz Najeib began. \"He was effing cleared by the court, was Bow,\" said Zak, a long-time Leeds supporter from the Middleton estate, which sprawls away on a hillside beyond Elland Road. \"They've already crucified him for \u00a31m in his costs. Why should he be losing his effing wages as well?\" The line was echoed by commuters hurrying to Leeds City station across the maze of traffic lights where the panic-stricken Asian students fled from a gang of white youths almost two years ago. \"They've nothing to be proud of in the way they got tanked up that night. I agree with O'Leary on that,\" said Don Garnett, a draughtsman heading home to Wakefield. \"But don't you think they've been punished enough? What's it Bowyer earns every week? Must be thousands at least.\" The Yorkshire Evening Post, with its banner headline Bowyer for sale, supplied the answer at news stands round City Square, where sales were well up on a usual Tuesday night. If the midfielder had agreed to the four-week fine, he would have lost another \u00a388,000 on top of the \u00a31m-plus costs forfeited at Hull crown court because of his lies to detectives investigating the attack. The paper had not had time to compose a leader on the wrongs and rights of the club's decision and was left with the Yorkshire Columnist of the Year Anne Pickles's even-handed conclusion: \"Don't be fooled by tawdry football scandals. We all share the blame for a yob-cultured youth.\" Bowyer also still beamed (an unusual exercise for him) from the pages between a couple of child patients at Leeds General Infirmary - white Joshua Hope and Afro-Caribbean Bronte Williams - where he had joined United's annual dishing out of presents by star players on Monday night. At least the Leeds United Supporters' Club is backing the club's decision. \"Lee Bowyer has been a highly influential player for us,\" said their chairman Ray Fell, \"but the fans feel that the club must always come first.\" At Radio Leeds, meanwhile, emails and phone calls were running lopsidedly in favour of the player and there was a similar consensus outside the club's ground on Elland Road. As traffic ground past on its way to the Leeds ring road and the M62, only a handful of fans echoed the supporters' club line. One who did was Betty Goodman, 63, who was frustrated by the media savaging given to O'Leary about the timing and title of his forthcoming book, Leeds United On Trial. She said: \"Why don't they listen to what he's saying - that it's just not right for the team to get drunk and run wild in Leeds? He's done right to follow that up with these fines, and I'm glad Mr Ridsdale's behind him too. \"He's got this big education job in Leeds, hasn't he? [Ridsdale chairs Education Leeds, the public-private partnership that runs local schools after a devastating report on the old LEA]. They've got to lay down the law.\" Peter Lorimer, a luminary of the great Leeds sides of the 1970s, also supports the club's stand. As a publican and former Scotland international he has some experience of the \"booze culture\" and its victims. \"I don't think it's inappropriate for players to go drinking in public full stop,\" he said. \"It's a question of how you behave when you're out. \"Ultimately you have a responsibility to the football club and therefore they've got to go along with the rules of the club.\" This is not the first time that Leeds have disciplined their wayward midfielder, as Lorimer pointed out. \"I'm sure he has been warned about breach of the rules before. \"He will be very difficult to replace. He's an excellent footballer but sometimes discipline is more important than an individual player.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
