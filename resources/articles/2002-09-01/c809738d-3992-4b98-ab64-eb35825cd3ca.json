Oh, how the office rejoiced! (In fact there was so much mutual backslapping, we were signed off for two weeks.) And then the fear hit us: how the devil could we make the Straightest Man On The Planet (move over John Major) sound interesting? We tried. God knows we tried. We handed him a Shoot circa-1983 questionnaire (what's your favourite band, food, page-three girl, etc. etc.) but his answer to \"What's your favourite game?\" (Michael Owen's World League Soccer) was typical. The man couldn't be controversial if he tried. So it was no surprise that today, on a sticky toffee of a wicket, Owen proved to be a straighter batter than Chris Tavare in his obdurate prime. The press pack started by asking Owen - England captain in David Beckham's absence against Portugal this weekend - his view of the escalating club-versus-country row over international friendlies. Gerard Houllier despises them, it was pointed out, while Becks and Paul Scholes had been withdrawn despite turning out for Manchester United earlier this week. Owen's response? \"I can see the club-versus-country row from both sides. But, from my point of view, I love joining up with England.\" You don't say. By this point, Owen's voice became drowned out by the noise generated by an irritated Fiver, whose molars were being sanded down into wee stumps by excessive grinding. Which is just as well, because what followed - a paean to the merits of Leeds gruesome twosome Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer (\"It's nice to see them both in the squad\") - would have been too much to take. THIS IS HUBRIS Pride comes before a fall, they say. And as the Scottish team did away with any notions of excessive self-esteem years ago, the chances of Berti Vogts's men recklessly tempting fate against the Faroe Islands seemed slim. Sadly, the enforced absence of Gary Naysmith through injury today forced Vogts to attempt to bolster morale in his camp, with disastrous effects: a new Ally McLeod was born! \"With Gary Naysmith I have the team I want in my mind, without him I do not,\" sobbed Vogts, not long in the job yet with that rabbit-in-headlights look favoured by Scotland managers already perfected. The beleaguered German was forced back to the drawing board after the Everton defender, who suffered an ankle injury in his side's defeat at Manchester City last weekend, was deemed unfit to travel. \"It is not a big problem,\" mused Vogts. \"We are not playing against the French, we are playing against the Faroes.\" Oh dear. \"They will fight, fight, fight against a big football nation like Scotland,\" continued Little Berti, suddenly getting a bit big for his boots. \"I watched the tapes from their recent matches with Liechtenstein. But this is a different game for them against a big football nation. They will fight and maybe look for a mistake from us in this game.\" As they probably won't have to look very far, Vogts has given the Faroes every reason to fancy their chances of ruining Scotland's Euro 2004 campaign before it's started, so what followed seemed mere hubristic indulgence. \"We had to win against Hong Kong and we won,\" boasted Vogts proudly. \"We have to win against the Faroes and we will win. We have made good preparations and I am not worried about it.\" Good grief. Quick, has anybody got a copy of Ally's Army by Andy Cameron? We need to reminisce about better days. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Steve spoke very highly of Bolton. He told me they were a good club\" - New Bolton signing Ivan Campo reveals how he became the victim of a cruel Steve McManaman joke. I'M A UNITED PLAYER, GET ME OUT OF HERE! The Fiver today braved the urban jungle to pose a moral question to the over-exposed inhabitants of an isolated and autonomous island, located on a slightly uneven rectangle of turf in the city of Manchester. The dilemma was this: if you were trapped on a strip of grass with only Tara P-T for company, what one thing would you need? Material sustenance (e.g. a shirt on your back to protect you from her sexual advances) or something spiritual (e.g. a book to bury your nose in and ignore her)? The Fiver received a variety of responses. The Imperial Lord Magoo plumped for the book, as he doesn't tend to see anything wrong with any of them (apart from the one by that tall bald Dutch bloke who used to hold his defence together). However, club director David Gill wanted to ban those troublesome tomes (perhaps so people were forced to buy expensive replica shirts instead). \"We need to make it clear that we don't think it's appropriate for players to publish a book while they're still playing for Manchester United. We believe they can do other commercial deals, but a book is another issue.\" Meanwhile, Royston Keane presumably decided that straying into the world of literature was far too much trouble, because he seemed much more preoccupied with the shirt option: he recently accused the England team of being more interested in swapping tops with their Brazilian opponents than winning a World Cup quarter-final. Luckily, Rio Ferdinand, slap bang in the middle of the England-United Venn diagram, wasn't taking Umbro-related umbrage at Roy's jibes. \"There is no animosity going on in the dressing room as far as I can see.\" No, all the animosity is directed towards those considered outsiders: Alfie Haaland, Alan Shearer, Jason McAteer, Phil Neville... THE RUMOUR MILL David Ginola is a footballer not a moviestar. Still, he's off to Nice. Barcelona have signed an agreement with River Plate to take Andres D'Alessandro off their hands. Birmingham City are sniffing around Ipswich's Marcus Bent. NEWS IN BRIEF Arsenal defender Matthew Upson has joined Reading on a three-month loan deal. Ivan Campo became the third player to enter the Bolton waiting room today. The 28-year-old defender has joined the club on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid but will not be available for around two weeks as he builds up his fitness. Chris Armstrong and Akin Bulent are also hanging around in the gym. St Mirren have sacked manager Tom Hendrie after a run of defeats which culminated in a 4-0 drubbing at home by Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Birmingham owner David Sullivan claims the club will not risk going out of business by overspending in a bid to stay in the Premiership. \"Basically, we have limited resources,\" said Sullivan. \"We have been doing our figures and are not prepared to financially ruin the club.\" Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has told manager Glenn Hoddle he can buy more players when the next transfer window opens in January. Levy has revealed that they have turned last year's \u00a33.5m trading loss into a \u00a3900,000 pre-tax profit.
