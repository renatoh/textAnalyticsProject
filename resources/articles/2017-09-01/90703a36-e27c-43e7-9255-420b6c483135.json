Hill made her statement in a series of replies to her followers on Twitter. \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself [with] other white supremacists,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe height of white privilege is being able to ignore his white supremacy, because it\u2019s of no threat to you. Well, it\u2019s a threat to me,\u201d she added. \u201c... He is unqualified and unfit to be president. He is not a leader. And if he were not white, he never would have been elected.\u201d On Wednesday, the White House condemned Hill\u2019s comments. \u201cThat is one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make and certainly is something that is a fireable offence by ESPN,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speak for that individual but I know that the president has met again with people like Senator Scott who are highly respected leaders in the African American community. He\u2019s committed to working with them to bring the country together. I think that\u2019s where we need to be focused; not on outrageous statements like that one.\u201d Hill\u2019s attack on the president caused ESPN to issue an apology on Tuesday, with the broadcaster saying her views \u201cdo not represent the position of ESPN.\u201d And \u201cshe recognizes her actions were inappropriate\u201d. On Tuesday night, Kaepernick sent a tweet addressed to Hill, saying \u201cwe are with you\u201d. Kaepernick is currently without an NFL team, something that is widely seen as due to his protest against racial injustice in the US. As part of the protest, Kaepernick chose not to stand during the national anthem last season. ESPN has long faced attacks from figures on the right, who accuse the broadcaster of liberal bias. In a blog earlier this year, Fox Sports\u2019 Clay Travis attacked ESPN because it has \u201cgiven awards to Caitlyn Jenner for becoming a woman, celebrated Michael Sam\u2019s bravery in coming out gay like he was a modern-day Jackie Robinson, and covered Colin Kaepernick like he\u2019s a modern-day Rosa Parks.\u201d Hill, who is black, received significant amounts of racist abuse from Twitter users following her comments. She has been with ESPN since 2006. In February this year she was appointed co-host of the broadcaster\u2019s flagship 6pm edition of SportsCenter alongside Michael Smith. Last month Hill discussed politics and Twitter with Sports Illustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t tweet a lot about politics,\u201d she said. \u201cI do tweet more about social issues, which I consider to be issues of morality. Racism isn\u2019t politics. Racism is an issue of right and wrong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
