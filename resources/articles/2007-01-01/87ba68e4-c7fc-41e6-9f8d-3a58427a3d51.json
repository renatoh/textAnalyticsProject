The move to a first-half pre-tax loss before exceptionals of \u00a329.1m \"reinforces our longstanding negative view on HMV,\" he said. \"The one new piece of news today is that the margin decline is going to be 30bps worse than previous guidance,\" noted Mr Davies, who has a \"sell\" recommendation on HMV's shares. His target price is 110p. \"It is hard for us to see any light at the end of the tunnel. At present, the market is assuming that profits recover again next year, but this seems excessively optimistic after a \u00a360m drop in the last two years.\" Analysts at Investec said in an early note that headline losses of \u00a324.5m before exceptionals were worse than their \u00a320m forecast. \"Current trade has picked up in HMV, but at additional cost to gross margins. With Waterstones still showing significant like-for-like declines, the business is still on the back foot. There remains the risk of further trimming of forecasts,\" they said. Keith Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers said: \"Set against a backdrop of low expectations - following the group's pre-Christmas profit warning - today's results do offer some crumbs of comfort. Lower prices at HMV UK have generated market share gains and online music sales continue to go from strength to strength (+200%).\" \"That said, the overall outlook for the group still looks extremely challenging. The schedule for new music releases remains uninspiring, taking on the likes of Amazon and Tesco remains daunting and international operations remain challenged. Whilst the dividend and some outside hopes of a takeover provide support, overall, market consensus opinion is likely to remain biased to the downside.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
