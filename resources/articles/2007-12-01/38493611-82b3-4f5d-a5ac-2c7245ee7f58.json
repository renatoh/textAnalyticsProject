Those who mythologise that review as the answer to all the FA's - and therefore English football's - shortcomings cannot have read it. Few in football actually have. If reports on portals can gather dust, that is the fate of Burns which lies, neglected, three clicks into the FA's website. If you take the trouble you might see that Lord Terry Burns, then the chairman of Abbey bank, now of Marks &amp; Spencer, did a painfully thin job of reshaping the FA. He was asked to consider English football's governing body, which in 1863 gave the great game to the world but then stumbled into the 21st century with its decision-making body, the council, constitutionally much as it was in the 19th. In 1992, a genuine destiny-shaping moment, after Hillsborough and with satellite TV's bonanza about to pour in, the FA council, mostly made up of grassroots representatives, was somehow persuaded to support the top clubs' breakaway from the Football League to form the Premier League and keep all the money. The FA's sole rationale was that it would improve the England team, because the Premier League would be reduced to 18 clubs, but that never happened because not enough clubs would vote themselves out of the gold rush. The England team's record since the breakaway has never matched the 1990 achievement of reaching a World Cup semi-final, yet the Premier League's power now makes it off limits to question whether its original purpose has been served. Extraordinarily, the Premier League is refusing even to countenance the idea that its clubs' lack of commitment to fielding England-qualified players might, just possibly, be undermining the national team. That encapsulates the balance a modern governing body must strike: encouraging the amazingly popular club game and fantastically successful Premier League while preserving a strong England team, nourishing the grassroots and trying to keep it all clean. Yet the FA floundered while the top clubs were massively enriched, and still they remained unhappy, buffeting the FA on such issues as their share of FA Cup television money and England team sponsorship arrangements. In 1999 the government brokered an agreement that for the first time, the Premier League would share some of its TV fortune - 5% - in order to refurbish playing fields which had been untouched through the boom. In an effort to make peace the FA agreed to reconstitute its main board, to have six professional game representatives (four from the Premier, two from the Football League), and six from the amateur \"national game\". That was supposed to preserve balance - and it is remarkable that in the age of the \u00a32.7bn TV deal David Gill, Manchester United's chief executive, sits across from Dave Henson, representative of the Devon County FA - but it did not fulfil even the basics of modern corporate governance, which requires an independent chairman and two non-executive directors. Into 2002, the board was often bitterly deadlocked, leading to an outright grab for power by the Premier League followed by the resignation of Adam Crozier, the then FA chief executive. Mark Palios, Crozier's successor, began a \"strategic review\" of the FA's role in the modern era but it and he did not outlast his frolics with Faria Alam. In the tabloid frenzy which followed, the then sports minister, Richard Caborn, declared the FA, in his favoured phrase, \"not fit for purpose\" and urged upon it a \"structural review\" led by Burns. Burns, then, arrived to reorganise the FA's internal structure without agreement on what the organisation should actually be trying to achieve. In his report, delivered in August 2005, Burns devoted just a few lines to the FA's purpose: \"Governance with integrity, the promotion of participation, standards and financial wellbeing of the game; the fostering of development at all levels; and effective representation of the game abroad.\" It was so bland nobody could argue, but a vision it wasn't. Burns confined himself to the \"decision-making structure\" but even then he was timid. He left the FA's gravest anachronism, its 92-member council, still featuring every county FA, the army, air force and navy and Oxford and Cambridge universities, intact. Its members, whom the FA encourages to use senior citizens' railcards for travel to meetings, have long struggled for clear direction. Burns did recognise that the council - overwhelmingly male, all white, average age around 75 - should become more \"representative\", but suggested it should do so by increasing in number. This year it expanded to include representatives from the Professional Footballers' and League Managers Associations, referees and a second from women's football. Malcolm Clarke, the Football Supporters' Federation chairman, has also been to the official outfitters, Aquascutum on Regent Street, to be measured for his blazer. Burns hoped the council would become the \"parliament\" of football; others involved despaired at his limited recommendations. Most people working at the FA are diligent professionals who love the game and would have welcomed a robust report which addressed its dysfunctions. Now, though, many complain at the government's reference to Burns as, as one put it, \"the holy grail\" when it has mostly been implemented. The compliance unit, attempting to deal with financial probity, has been reorganised and a professional game board set up which will further extend the Premier and Football Leagues' influence. Stubborn defence by the \"national game\" representatives and concessions by the leagues also secured agreement to split FA profits equally between the professional and amateur sides. The sticking point, still, is Burns's recommendations for board reform, that it should have an independent chairman and two \"non-executive\" directors. The national game representatives stunned everybody by objecting to that; they argue that any appointees will be business people entertained and seduced by the Premier League. That has exasperated the government, professionals and many within the FA, who argue the national game directors should lobby just as passionately. Finally, they agreed to an independent chairman, for which the recruitment process is down to a shortlist of three, with the preferred candidate due to be put to the board later this month. The national game directors, though, dug their heels in over independent directors, refusing, as one says, to \"see the need for it\". The idea's advocates argue the aim is \"good governance\" - Lord Mawhinney, chairing the selection panel, is understood to be seeking a plc-experienced figure to overhaul the decision-making mechanics. A central vision, though, remains as starkly absent as a successful England team. Another \"strategic review\" is currently under way, due to report in the spring. So out of football's turmoil, and the failure of the Premier League's \"golden generation\", the targets for government flak are not billionaires buying clubs to serve their own interests but senior citizens on the FA board fighting, unpaid, as best they can see it, for the multitudes who play the game for love.
