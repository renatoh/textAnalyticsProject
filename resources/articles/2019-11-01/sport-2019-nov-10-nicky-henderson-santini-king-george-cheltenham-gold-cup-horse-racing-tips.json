But hopes are still nursed that this seven-year-old, so striking on looks, can make himself into a contender for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, despite running about a stone below what might have been expected here. In fairness the circumstances of this race did not lend themselves to an awe-inspiring performance. There were only four runners, none of them a natural pace-setter, and all of them returning from a summer\u2019s break on softer ground than their connections were probably hoping to find. Now McGinty, who trailed Santini by 27 lengths when they met at Cheltenham last March and was a 12-1 shot here, generously shouldered the burden of making the running and his reward was that he was still there to fight out a finish with the 1-3 favourite on the run-in. He battled hard and briefly looked like causing a significant shock but was beaten a head by his more imposing rival. \u201cHard work, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d was the initial, pensive reaction from Henderson. \u201cHe was rusty and dusty. It did look laboured. He hasn\u2019t come out and started the season with a bang, I\u2019ll be the first to admit. I thought he\u2019d got beat, to be honest with you.\u201d The spectators gained enormously, as there was a thrilling finish to a race which generally turns into a procession from the third-last. When Might Bite and Coneygree won it, there was no doubt about the outcome for at least the last half-mile. Judged on this showing, Santini would not be in their class but there are always excuses to make for a young horse and, on reflection, a few valid ones apply in his case. \u201cThe pace was just a bit stop/start the entire way,\u201d said his jockey, Nico de Boinville. \u201cI know the second horse runs in snatches. We were trying to help each other along and we ended up at the post together. There\u2019s plenty to work on but we know the ability\u2019s there. \u201cHe wants big, galloping tracks. The Gold Cup course at Cheltenham will play into his hands. The Old Course in the RSA played against us, in a way. The improvement will come.\u201d Henderson pointed out that this was only the fourth run for Santini over fences. \u201cHe had a horrible season last year. The whole thing got thrown completely out of sync with that wretched flu drama in February, because he was meant to go to the Reynoldstown for some experience before Cheltenham and then we couldn\u2019t do that because we had to vaccinate the week before. It was straight into the RSA on two runs, no experience, and then he was lame for three weeks. Two days before the RSA, he was an unlikely runner but we just got him sound on the day and he ran a hell of a race on no preparation whatsoever. \u201cI think you\u2019d have to say he doesn\u2019t look like a King George horse. That\u2019s not his track. I think you put a line through the King George.\u201d But Santini will need a run between now and his Gold Cup prep at Cheltenham in late January and Henderson does not have many options, since he did not seem terribly keen on a trip to Ireland for the Savills Chase. Anyone who thinks Santini will turn up for the King George anyway can now get 40-1, while the horse is a 10-1 shot for the Gold Cup behind Kemboy, Al Boum Photo and Lostintranslation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
