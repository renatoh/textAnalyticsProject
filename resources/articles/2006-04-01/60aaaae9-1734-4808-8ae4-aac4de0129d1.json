Although many of the gardens listed open regularly, the most intriguing ones are hidden from view year-round and open for a sneaky peek only when the owners decide they are at their prime. Happily, these make up the bulk of the book. The owners are passionate gardeners who have developed their own style away from the moderating influence of committees and ticket sales, and who are delighted to chat about their gardens, all for charity. The other great thing about the book is that it stops garden visiting being purely a country pursuit. Among the cottages, old rectories and converted mills that admittedly dominate, more than 100 gardens call themselves town, urban or suburban. What perhaps prevents there being more is the stipulation that each must hold at least 45 minutes of interest: however beautiful the planting, you would struggle to make a visit to a balcony last that long. However, where possible smaller gardens are grouped together. For instance, Wroxham Gardens in Lancashire is a collection of six town gardens, all on the same road. They offer cottage-style planting, a formal garden, a hosta border, fountains, rockeries and a conservatory. You might even get a glimpse into the front room on your way through. \u00b7 The Yellow Book is available for \u00a37.99 (inc p&amp;p), from ngs.org.uk, garden centres and bookshops."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
