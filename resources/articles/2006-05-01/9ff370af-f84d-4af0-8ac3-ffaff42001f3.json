His retirement was marked by even greater achievement. He never lost the habit of hard work and was influential throughout his life because of his bedrock integrity and sound judgment. Brought up in Bridlington, Yorkshire, he was a leading chorister in his parish church choir, the beginning of a lifetime interest in music. In 1942, at the age of 14, he joined the army as a boy soldier. At Channings Wood, then an army training centre (later a prison), he was talent-spotted and, at 17, was sent to Sandhurst, where he survived the snobbery of the time and was awarded the sword of honour. By the time he was promoted to the rank of major at 28 - an early age for the postwar army - he had been commissioned in the Royal Artillery. As a forward observation officer attached to the Northumberland Fusiliers, he won a Military Cross in the battle of the Imjin river during the Korean war. He always remained tight-lipped about the circumstances and never attended a reunion; his attitude to past achievements was that \"you are defined by what you are going to do.\" It became clear to Lakes while he was serving with the Royal West African Rifles in Ghana that his attitude of fairness to all was out of kilter with the colonialist attitude shown towards black troops by his fellow officers. So he decided to leave the army and join the prison service, and after a period of training, in 1962 was posted to what was then Feltham borstal, Middlesex, as housemaster. The institution housed unstable adolescents with whom Lakes made excellent contact; he took part in the brass band, the musical therapy of an otherwise stultifying traditional training regime. It was clear to his contemporaries that Lakes had - rightly - been marked out for promotion, first to the Prison Officers' Training School and then, in 1968, to be in charge of Thorp Arch remand centre, Yorkshire. In 1970, he became governor III, which involved manpower recruitment, then deputy governor of Pentonville prison, north London. In 1975, he was made governor of the high security Gartree prison, Leicestershire, where, with a volatile population and prickly staff, he demonstrated his sure touch and leadership. After three years, it was no surprise that he should be called to head office to be put in charge of security, then made deputy to the chief inspector - a time when he was involved in the inquiry into the 1983 mass escape from the high-security Maze prison in northern Ireland. His final promotion, in 1985, was as deputy director-general of the prison service. He should have become director-general but the curious custom of appointing a career civil servant with no knowledge and, sometimes, less aptitude to be director was still in operation. This has now changed and possibly it was Lakes' manifest capability that was influential in the removal of this career glass ceiling for prison governors. However, loyalty matched his capability, and it became his task to guide the prison service through industrial unrest and the so-called \"fresh start\". This was carried out with energy and effective- ness, and what impressed his colleagues was that, despite promotion to the rarefied heights of the Home Office, he had lost none of his forthright directness and honesty: he told it plain, and you certainly knew where you were with him in charge. He retired in 1988, having been awarded that rare mark of distinction, an honorary life membership of the Prison Officers' Association. In retirement, he was a member of the Woolf inquiry into the 1990 Strangeways prison riot in Manchester, served on the Council of Europe torture committee and chaired the Sicily Conference, where prison officials from the former communist block met their western counterparts. His tour of the prison fac- ilities of the Baltic states was a model of precision and compassion. His work on the mental health commission required sensitivity and awareness. Despite crippling rheumatoid arthritis for his last 20 years, and the death of his wife Nan (they had married in 1949, following an \"understanding\" from the age of 14), he continued to work, and was a consultant to the Northern Ireland administration from 1998-2004. Lakes was noted for his integrity and compassion. It was characteristic that once, in the early 1970s, he was required to accompany police to eject squatters from empty prison quarters. Two of the squatters were a young couple, the woman heavily pregnant. Lakes took them, in the early hours, on a tour of available squats, found one and settled them in. He told nobody what he had done. He is survived by his daughter, Alison, and grandchildren Claire and Tim. \u00b7 Gordon Harry Lakes, prison governor, born August 27 1928; died April 23 2006"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
