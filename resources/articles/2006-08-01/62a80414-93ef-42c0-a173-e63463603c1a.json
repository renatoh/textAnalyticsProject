Their great rivals, Coolmore, served a reminder that on the two-year-old front they are ahead of the game when Holy Roman Emperor ran out an impressive winner of the Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh. Aidan O'Brien's colt, who runs in the colours of Mrs John Magnier, was cut to 6-1 favourite, from 16-1, by the Tote and Coral for next year's 2,000 Guineas. Godolphin have found Classic success hard to come by in recent years, and even their admirable record with older horses at the highest level was looking shaky - until yesterday. Electrocutionist, in the Dubai World Cup in March, had been their only Group One strike of the year until Frankie Dettori's well-executed ride on Librettist. \"The horses are now performing to their maximum,\" said Godolphin's racing manager, Simon Crisford, after Librettist had held on by a neck and a head from Manduro and Peeress. Dettori was in jubilant mood. \"This is a very important win for everyone on the Godolphin team,\" he said. \"The Jacques le Marois is one of the big races of the season and Librettist won it well on very bad ground. My horse's class counted for a lot today,\" added Dettori, who initiated a double when successful on the Aga Khan's promising two-year-old, Visionario, in a 7f Listed race. Cherry Mix, who had acted as pacemaker for Electrocutionist in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes, benefited from getting a good lead himself in his Group One race in Cologne. Sent on with two furlongs to run by Kerrin McEvoy, the five-year-old romped home by four lengths from Fracas, who relegated Alan Swinbank's gallant Collier Hill to third spot. \"Kerrin gave him a fine ride,\" said the Godolphin representative Alan Byrne. \"Cherry Mix has run in six different countries since we got him. He has a lot of options now. Maybe he will come back to Germany for the Grosser Preis von Baden.\" At the Curragh, meanwhile, it was business as usual for Aidan O'Brien in the Phoenix Stakes, where Holy Roman Emperor gave the Ballydoyle trainer his eighth victory in the Group One juvenile feature, won last year by George Washington. Holy Roman Emperor showed an impressive turn of foot when given the office by Kieren Fallon and readily turned tables on his Royal Ascot conqueror, Hellvelyn. The winner will not be resting on his laurels and now heads to the Darley Prix Morny at Deauville next weekend. O'Brien said: \"He's quite a horse, isn't he. He was explosive when he got out and he's able to turn it on. He just powered through. He'll go to the Prix Morny next weekend, he just wants to race and racing brings out the best in him.\" \"He's got such a great temperament. He just bounced off the ground and quickened,\" said Fallon. \"George [Washington] did it easily last year and he has done it impressively as well. I just gave him a shake of the reins and he was gone. I didn't think he would quicken like that. He's done nothing here, it was like a piece of work for him.\" Ace, with American jockey Garrett Gomez aboard in the enforced absence of Fallon, could only finish sixth behind The Tin Man in Saturday night's Arlington Million in Chicago. Andrew Balding's Phoenix Reach was last, a position also occupied by John Best's filly Rising Cross in the Beverly D Stakes. O'Brien said yesterday that George Washington faces a crucial workout today to determine if his return to action will be at Leopardstown next weekend or in the Celebration Mile at Goodwood the following Sunday. The 2,000 Guineas winner has been off the track since pulling a hip muscle when finishing second to Araafa in the Irish equivalent over two months ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
