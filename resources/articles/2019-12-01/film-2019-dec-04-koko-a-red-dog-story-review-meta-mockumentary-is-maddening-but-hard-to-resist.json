Well, kind of. Sort of. Maybe? It\u2019s complicated. By \u201cRed Dog\u201d I am not actually referring to the legendarily gregarious canine \u2013 the subject of multiple books and two hugely successful Australian films, who was so treasured in the Pilbara region in Western Australia that a statue was erected in his honour. I am instead referring to Koko, one of the dog actors who played Red Dog in the first movie, to whom the sequel Red Dog: True Blue was dedicated. Koko\u2019s life \u2013 which ended in 2012 \u2013 is the topic of Koko: A Red Dog Story, a sassy and energetic third and final outing which playfully explores the unconditional love offered by dogs and the emotional impact they have on humans. Co-directors Aaron McCann and Dominic Pearce open with the narrator (Jason Isaacs, best-known as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films) putting all human achievements within perspective: \u201cFire, the wheel, the silicon chip \u2013 all very impressive,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the single greatest thing to happen to the human race is the evolution of the domestic dog.\u201d In direct-to-cam interviews, Kriv Stenders (director of the first two Red Dog films), Carol Hobday (Koko\u2019s breeder and first human parent) and Nelson Woss (producer of all three films and Koko\u2019s key human during his later years) reminisce about their titular old pal in ways one would associate with a human, setting in motion a film that treats its love for pooches very seriously \u2013 but in endearing, tongue-in-cheek ways. \u201cHe was very driven, incredibly focused,\u201d says Stenders. \u201cA star,\u201d adds Woss. And \u201ca brat \u2013 just like a normal child,\u201d according to Hobday, who later amusingly recalls how Koko apparently got a big head after winning his first championship, leading him to \u201cto strut around the town as if he owned the place.\u201d If you watch the film without watching the trailer, Koko: A Red Dog Story looks like a documentary, sounds like a documentary, and, erm, barks like a documentary \u2013 albeit with semi-fictitious elements, including reenactment scenes where Stenders, Hobday and Woss are are played by actors (and Koko is played by a lookalike, Hero). But the trailer \u2013 and the press notes \u2013 presents it as something different altogether: a Christopher Guest-style film or, as the press notes put it, \u201ca fictionalised take on real-life events shot in a documentary style\u201d, and \u201cthe Spinal Tap or Exit Through the Gift Shop of dog movies\u201d. Herein lies the problem: it\u2019s not quite a mockumentary either. The film is a highly spirited and thoroughly entertaining love letter to doggos in general, and one loveable pooch in particular, but thanks to the appearance of and testimonies from the real people involved in this dog\u2019s life, it blends fact and fiction in a way that came close to breaking my brain: were the segments I was particularly moved by \u2013 including a portion examining Koko\u2019s showdog career, and an intense emotional moment late in the piece \u2013 true to life or tall tales (tails?). A conversation with the producer assured me that those moments were fundamentally truthful \u2013 but some details were made up, and they\u2019re hard to distinguish from the others: Koko was never in the running for a role in Fury Road; never went on a press tour overseas; and never jumped through a glass window. It seems it\u2019s best to think of A Red Dog Story as a feature film presented in a documentary style \u2013 but one which, unlike mockumentaries, is based on truth. The Red Dog series has always involved capturing and embellishing a legend, so perhaps the unusual approach is justified. The most pleasant surprise in the first sequel, Red Dog: True Blue, was its meta qualities; it even began with characters visiting the cinema to watch the original movie, before evolving into a bedtime yarn with a A Princess Bride-esque flashback narrative. McCann and Pearce get meta in different ways, jumping between interview footage, re-enactments, home videos and news footage. But the details of Koko\u2019s real life were clearly rich enough for the directors to embrace without complicating it with small and immaterial lies. And it is hard to see the point; it feels like the audience may be getting punk\u2019d for no good reason. It\u2019s not operating on the same level, for instance, as Martin Scorsese\u2019s recent (and historically inaccurate) quasi-documentary Rolling Thunder Revue, which is a film about putting on performances and wearing masks. Yet Koko: A Red Dog Story is hard to resist. At the risk of conjuring a sentence that will inflame the centuries-long war between canines and felines, it is certain to be catnip for dog lovers. A general, playful wholesomeness ensconces the film, which arrives in Australian cinemas very much an underdog \u2013 against stiff competition in the form of Frozen 2 and the new The Addams Family. Despite the confusion, I\u2019m rooting for Red Dog. Or Koko. Or one of the dog actors who played Koko. Like I said, it\u2019s complicated. \u2022 Koko: A Red Dog Story is in Australian cinemas from 5 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
