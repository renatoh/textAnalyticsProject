A Ronald G\u00f3mez free-kick had put Costa Rica in front against the run of play before Bosacki meet corners from Maciej Zurawski and Jacek Krzynowek on either side of half-time. Poland's coach Pawel Janas was understandably pleased with the result following calls for him to resign after their early departure. \"We scored through the set-pieces,\" he said. \"We had been criticised because we couldn't score through set-pieces. Today we did. I'm very happy. It was very hot today and I'm glad the team responded to my tactics.\" Costa Rica's defender Luis Mar\u00edn said his team would also return home with their heads held high. \"The team played fairly well but they took advantage of their corner kicks and their physical strength,\" he said. \"The team fought right to the end and so we are going home with a clear conscience.\" The two teams had suffered defeats against Ecuador and Germany in their opening games. Cheered on by a full house of 43,000 fans, overwhelmingly dominated by their colourful and loud fans, the Poles started confidently on a hot and humid afternoon, stroking the ball around well in midfield. But they lacked the urgency that marked their brave performance against Germany last week and apart from some incisive runs by Ireneusz Jelen, they struggled to press the Costa Rican defence early on. That all changed after G\u00f3mez gave Costa Rica the lead with a free-kick struck through a gap in Poland's wall and between the legs of their Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc. The Poles thenpoured forward more aggressively and claimed their reward for six first-half corners when Bosacki volleyed in, off the bar, in the 33rd minute. The goal was Poland's first at the finals, and Bosacki grabbed his second with a powerful header from close range after climbing above Paulo Wanchope to connect with a corner in the 66th minute. Janas added some extra menace up front at half-time, introducing Pawel Brozek for Celtic's Zurawski, the Poles' biggest name before the finals and a disappointment in all three games. Brozek and Jelen looked more lively but the Poles continued to be let down by poor delivery from dead-ball situations and the failure of the midfield to get forward in support. Jacek Krzynowek went close with a long-range left-foot drive, but other than their set-pieces, the Poles had little to show for their dominance. But still they departed the happier side. \"We paid dearly for our distractions. They cost us in all three matches,\" said Costa Rica's coach Alexandre Guimaraes. \"The goals came on our carelessness on set plays.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
