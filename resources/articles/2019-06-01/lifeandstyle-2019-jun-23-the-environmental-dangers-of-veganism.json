I\u2019d be more than happy if you replaced \u201cveganism\u201d with \u201crejecting industrialised food production\u201d. But does anyone think that a move to plant-based eating that includes, for example, monoculture (almonds), habitat destruction (palm oil) and food miles (avocados) is something we should aim for? There are lots of good arguments for changing our diet, but thought must be given to the means of food production and distribution.
