The bill creates a system for case-by-case fugitive transfers between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and regions with which it does not already have agreements, including mainland China. Opponents of the law say it is being pushed by the Chinese government, and fear that Beijing will use it to extradite activists, dissidents and other political opponents who will end up in China\u2019s opaque and politicised courts. Striking a defiant tone on Monday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said: \u201cThis bill is not initiated by the [Chinese] central people\u2019s government. I have not received any instruction.\u201d Opposition to the bill was a result of a misunderstanding, she added. The bill\u2019s supporters say it plugs existing loopholes and will prevent the city from becoming a bolthole for fugitives. Hong Kong\u2019s administration is determined to pass the bill before July, and has pegged its urgency on the case of a man wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Taiwan. \u201cHong Kong has to move on,\u201d Lam said. \u201cNobody wants Hong Kong to be a fugitive offenders\u2019 haven.\u201d On Sunday hundreds of thousands of people marched in opposition to the bill. Organisers estimate that 1 million people took part in the march \u2013 which would make it the city\u2019s biggest protest since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 \u2013 although police put the figure at 240,000 at its peak. The protests were peaceful until midnight, when police and demonstrators clashed after attempts to disperse some remaining protesters from the area outside the legislative offices. Another rally will be held on Wednesday, when the second reading of the bill will be debated by legislators. Martin Lee, a leading barrister, former legislator, and key figure of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement, told the Guardian he believed there would be lots more protests if the government did not adequately respond to Sunday\u2019s enormous public showing. Lee said the government was \u201csaying no to democracy and suppressing human rights and the rule of law\u201d. There is widespread fear in Hong Kong of Beijing\u2019s increasing encroachment into the city, 22 years after it was was returned from British rule to exist under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d regime, which guarantees it an independent legal system. Lam said the size of the demonstration showed there were \u201cclearly still concerns\u201d about the bill, but the fact that so many people had taken part showed the city was still free. \u201cI think they clearly demonstrate that these rights and freedoms are as robust as ever,\u201d she said. China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said it continued to firmly support Hong Kong in passing the bill. The ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing \u201cresolutely opposes\u201d the interference of \u201cexternal forces\u201d in Hong Kong\u2019s legislative affairs. In an editorial on Monday, the state-owned China Daily defended the legislation and blamed opposition parties and \u201cforeign forces\u201d for creating chaos in Hong Kong. \u201cAny fair-minded person would deem the amendment bill a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that would strengthen Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law and deliver justice,\u201d it said, adding that Hong Kong residents had been \u201choodwinked\u201d by the opposition camp and their \u201cforeign allies\u201d. \u201cSome foreign forces are seizing the opportunity to advance their own strategy to hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong,\u201d the paper said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
