Last week, Sanders delivered a searing defense of democratic socialism that set himself apart from the rest of the Democratic party, whose opposition he said he not only anticipated but welcomed. Days later, at a gathering of nearly 250 political moderates convened by the centrist thinktank Third Way in South Carolina, some of the party\u2019s most prominent center-left voices took the bait. \u201cI believe a gay midwestern mayor can beat [Donald] Trump. I believe an African American senator can beat Trump. I believe a western governor, a female senator, a member of Congress, a Latino Texan or a former vice-president can beat Trump,\u201d said Jon Cowan, president of Third Way, hours before Donald Trump formally launched his re-election campaign with a rally in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe a self-described democratic socialist can win.\u201d In speeches and on panels over the course of two sticky days in Charleston earlier this week, moderate lawmakers, strategists and donors inveighed against the Vermont senator\u2019s populist economic vision. The approach elevated a conversation that has largely taken place behind closed doors about how to thwart Sanders, who moderates believe would alienate crucial voting blocs in a general election. \u201cHe has made it his mission to either get the nomination or to remake the party in his image as a democratic socialist,\u201d Cowan told the Guardian. \u201cThat is an existential threat to the future of the Democratic party for the next generation.\u201d Sanders \u2013 who maintains his political identity as an independent\u2013 has made it clear he intends to run against the Democratic establishment even as he seeks the party\u2019s nomination. Third Way\u2019s public criticism of the senator, days before the first presidential primary debates next week, reflects sharp new dividing lines in the battle for control of the party. \u2018Anybody but Bernie\u2019 \u201cThe cat is out of the bag,\u201d Sanders tweeted on Wednesday, sharing a Politico story about how mainstream Democrats are warming to Elizabeth Warren, his closest ideological ally. \u201cThe corporate wing of the Democratic party is publicly \u2018anybody but Bernie\u2019.\u201d His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that the party\u2019s moderate faction had effectively \u201cdeclared war on Senator Sanders\u201d and denounced Third Way as a \u201cWashington thinktank that takes Wall Street money.\u201d Sanders and his allies believe that the Democratic party\u2019s turn toward corporatism led to Trump\u2019s rise and that the theory of political electability advanced by group\u2019s like Third Way is no match for the mood of the electorate in a populist moment. As Democrats becomes more liberal, their views on socialism, especially among young people, are warming. Earlier this month at a party event in California earlier this month, the Democratic hopeful John Hickenlooper was booed by the audience for saying socialism is \u201cnot the answer\u201d. But after more than two years of standing by as the party\u2019s progressive faction flexed its newfound power, moderates again feel ascendant. Emboldened by the results of the 2018 midterm elections, which saw pragmatic Democrats win in dozens of Republican-held districts to deliver a majority in the House of Representatives, they are increasingly vocal in their disdain for socialism \u2013 and Sanders. But the question of how to constrain Sanders is complicated. In 2016, Trump defeated a wide field of more experienced and more qualified candidates with a populist message that appealed to the right\u2019s anti-establishment anger. In a race with a similarly large field of candidates, Sanders enters with far more advantages than Trump did: the Vermont senator is both experienced and qualified, with a dedicated following, a prodigious small-dollar fundraising operation, a developed economic platform and a populist appeal that surges when he is attacked by the political establishment he ran against to great effect in 2016. Trump and Republicans continue to hurl the socialism label at the Democrat field. On Tuesday night, Trump warned in a speech formally launching his re-election campaign: \u201cA vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.\u201d None of Sanders\u2019s 23 competitors have embraced the democratic socialism label. Warren, who is nipping at his heels in some recent polls, distinguishes herself as a capitalist. Attitudes toward socialism are shifting in the US. Recent surveys have found that young people and women associate socialism with European countries rather than Soviet Russia. Yet socialism remains broadly unpopular: less than half of American voters say they would vote for a \u201cqualified presidential candidate who is a socialist\u201d, according to a Gallup poll released in May. \u2018Who\u2019s better on the economy?\u2019 The mood at the conference vacillated from nervous optimism to nervous pessimism about Democrats\u2019 prospects for beating Trump in 2020. \u201cIf we don\u2019t nominate a self-proclaimed socialist, we\u2019ll probably be OK,\u201d said Jen Psaki, who was White House communications director under Obama. \u201cI hope so.\u201d But the former North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp, who lost re-election in 2018, warned that Democrats would continue to lose the White House and the US Senate unless the party makes inroads with rural voters. \u201cWe have stopped talking to the middle of the country,\u201d said Heitkamp, who launched One Country Project that seeks to \u201cre-engage rural America\u201d. \u201cPeople feel like we\u2019ve abandoned the bread-and-butter issues, and people in rural America feel it more accutely.\u201d Emphasizing her point, she said that if farmers from her state were asked to name the three biggest problems in rural America, \u201cnot one would say: antitrust\u201d. During the final panel of the day, Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, predicted the 2020 election will be extremely close. \u201cWe could be sitting on election day not knowing who will win,\u201d he said. \u2018Get off Twitter\u2019 Several speakers urged those in the room to \u201cget off Twitter\u201d and venture into the real world, where far fewer Democrats are engaged in \u201cfaculty lounge debates over political ideology\u201d. \u201cThere is a potential that the hyper-hyper-engaged \u2013 the extremely online voters that are paying attention right now \u2013 might be able to drive the direction of the campaigns,\u201d said Lanae Erickson, a senior vice-president at Third Way. She presented a poll conducted by the thinktank that found only one in 10 Democratic primary voters tweet regularly. When compared with the wider Democratic electorate, this cohort of \u201cextremely online\u201d Democrats are far less likely to identify as moderate, are more likely to have participated in a protest and support progressives policies such as Medicare for All. Moderates\u2019 theory on how to win in 2020, as described by one panelist during the conference, is to appeal to the \u201cwoke and the still waking\u201d. The best candidate, they argue, is someone who can mobilize a Democratic base that is increasingly young, diverse and liberal, while still appealing to independents, moderate Republicans and working-class voters who could decide the election. This is not achieved with \u201cwarmed-over 1990s centrism\u201d, said Cowan, but neither is it achieved by \u201c1960s Nordic-style socialism\u201d. \u201cVoters do not want mushy, bland, empty Democratic centrism,\u201d Cowan said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not who this rising generation of swing district winners are.\u201d On Monday evening, one of those new House members, the South Carolina congressman Joe Cunningham, welcomed the group to his district, which the 37-year-old flipped last year after decades of Republican control. Cunningham said he did not win his race by promising Medicare for All or by demonizing Republicans. Rather, he said he won by positioning himself as a moderate who was willing to work across the aisle and occasionally buck his own party. Like a football coach rallying his team before a game, Cunningham said Republicans who run to the right to embrace Trump are \u201cceding more and more ground in the middle\u201d. \u201cThere is so much middle ground to gain in 2020,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI say we take it!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
