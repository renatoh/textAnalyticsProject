Mr Lindsay, who is based in London, is expected to stay at the agency until the end of the year. Jerry Judge, the chief executive of Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide, said Mr Lindsay's position would not be filled. \"While I was disappointed by Tim's decision to leave the agency, I respect his wish to take stock of his personal and professional aspirations at this point in his career,\" said Mr Judge. \"He has been a valued partner to me, and he will be sorely missed. I very much appreciate his willingness to remain on board for several months to affect a smooth transition.\" Mr Lindsay joined the London agency in 1995 as managing director. He was president of Europe from 1999 to 2001. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
