It's always the same. Whenever they play either of their most ferocious rivals from the northern triangle - Juventus and AC Milan - they brace themselves to be mocked. 'Non vincete mai,' holler their opponents. You never win. And the best they can offer in return is expletives, because, as one Inter fan puts it, their loser status is 'the sad truth'. That truth just might be about to turn happier, however. Inter - whose penchant for throwing around obscene amounts of money for a trifling return makes them a morality tale in the modern game - boast their strongest team for almost a decade. For once they are the Milan team most likely to wrestle with Juventus for the title. It's early days, especially for a club with an obvious complex (since they last won the title in 1989, they have watched Milan triumph six times and Juve five - oh the incessant pain), but revived by Roberto Mancini, they mean business. There are several reasons for enthusiasm. 1. They got shot of Christian Vieiri. Coincidentally, Inter instantly waved goodbye to a chaotic atmosphere, and hello to a harmonious and unified dressing room. Adriano, their heavyweight Brazilian predator, is content enough to last week extend his contract to 2010. And if he is happy, everyone is ecstatic. 'Adriano,' says Mancini, 'is the symbol of Inter.' 2. Luis Figo is reborn. He is one of a number of remotivated rejects (all Real Madrid cast-offs welcome, and Inter are delighted to see Walter Samuel has rediscovered the defensive arts in Italy, while Santiago Solari is also settling down well). 'I think that Figo can be of real help to this squad, a lot more than I was when I went to Lazio towards the end of my playing career,' noted Mancini. 'He has proved that he can still play like a champion.' 3. Last season's draw specialists (18 of their 38 league games ended even) have shaken the habit. They have sharpened up at both ends of the field. 4. David Pizarro. The man who speared Rangers in midweek in an almost unwatchably strange Champions League game at an empty San Siro, is already a massive hit. The Chilean playmaker who arrived from Udinese is arguably Inter's best capture for years. 5. They beat Juve last April in the league, and again in the pre-season Super Cup. Has the tide turned? All these factors will lighten Inter hearts en route to Turin, but deep down, they must also contend with inbuilt fear and loathing of Juventus. The Italian champions have started the season like a bullet train. Like Chelsea in England, their 100 per cent record and defensive meanness casts an intimidating shadow over the rest of Serie A. They are only three points ahead of Inter, but if they increase that with a win tonight just about all bets are off. Standards are so lofty that Fabio Capello rollocked his maverick striker Zlatan Ibrahimovich for being 'too egotistical' in Juve's midweek Champions League runout. The fact that Ibrahimovich scored his first European goal for the club, and Juve won 3-0, was no mitigation for Don Fabio. As Capello says: 'This is a team that doesn't settle for second best.' Juventus versus Inter is known as the 'derby d'Italia'. This particular confrontation is more acidic than when the two Milan teams, or the two most successful teams (AC Milan and Juve) lock horns. The Inter hierarchy still harbour a grudge about an infamous derby in 1998. The team they built around Ronaldo were on course for the title, and felt robbed by the kind of refereeing decision that gives Juve-haters rocketing blood pressure. In the last minute the referee refused Inter a clear penalty for a foul on Ronaldo and, mid-protest, Alessandro Del Piero broke to score the winner for Juventus. Needless to say, in the spirit of non vincete mai Inter's title bid promptly collapsed. Can Mancini's new, improved Inter banish their Juve-phobia? Massimo Moratti, the Inter benefactor, bristles at the question. 'There was no inferiority complex,' he replies. 'There have been many matches that have had their own story. I don't think the one with Ronaldo was a match with an inferiority complex.' Not touching a nerve, there, obviously. As if any extra spice were needed today, Capello and Mancini are as compatible as Mourinho and Wenger. Weiss 'n' easy The Champions League was designed with the rich and powerful in mind. Raise a glass, therefore, to FC Thun and Artmedia Bratislava, the two scruffy gatecrashers who won their first matches at Europe's high table last week. The performance of the Slovakians against Porto was particularly refreshing. They trailed 2-0 at half-time, away from home, against a team who were reigning European Champions in 2004. Then their coach Vladimir Weiss chose inspiration over damage limitation. 'We played with our hearts,' Weiss said. 'I told my players during the break that it is better to lose 5-2 than not try to get something. It worked.' With an attitude like that, he'd never survive in the 4-5-1 world of the Premiership. Walk on the Wilde side A worrying tale from neighbouring Belgium. Anderlecht fans set upon a KVC Westerlo player who came to watch their Champions League game against Real Betis and left him battered and with a broken nose. Bjorn De Wilde, Westerlo's striker, was on his way home when he and his girlfriend were attacked. De Wilde will be out for at least three weeks. 'It was horrible, especially when you consider that I am a true Anderlecht fan.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
