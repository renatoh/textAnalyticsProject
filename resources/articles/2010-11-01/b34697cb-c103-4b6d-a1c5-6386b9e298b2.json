Further inspired by two of the orchestra's star players, the clarinettist Robert Plane and the trumpeter Philippe Schartz, Holt has conceived Centauromachy as a double concerto, reflecting the dual nature of the centaur with all its ambiguities and sense of liminal being. Holt's masterstroke is to have Schartz play the flugelhorn, which has a more silky sound than the trumpet but is almost identical in range to the clarinet. There are moments when each instrument's timbre seems to linger on the threshold of the other; together they blend into an altogether different sound quality, and yet can also contrast brilliantly. The magical and otherworldly effect befits the mythical creature. Five titled movements invoke visual and programmatic ideas that in turn condition the tightly worked fabric of the score; the fourth, Pitched Battle, enacts the legendary conflict between the Centaurs and the Lapiths \u2013 the Centauromachy for which the piece is named \u2013 and offers a metaphor for the centaur's internal warring, while the final movement is both eulogy and elegy for Chiron, the most superior centaur. The soloists' interplay with the orchestra is characteristically intricate, and conductor Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth handled it with care. Plane and Schartz realised the virtuosity effortlessly, allowing the work's core expressiveness and the feeling of an ultimately tortured superbeing to vividly emerge. Albert Roussel's ballet Bacchus et Ariane, Suite No 2, had established the evening's mythological theme; Roth's equally lively and often balletic account of Sibelius's Second Symphony missed something of its intrinsic nobility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
