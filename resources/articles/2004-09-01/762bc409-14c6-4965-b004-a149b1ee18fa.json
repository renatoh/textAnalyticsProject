Alitalia executives are proposing an overhaul of the company, eliminating a third of the airline's 20,700 jobs and creating a smaller national carrier with a new name, AZ Fly, union members said yesterday after a meeting with Alitalia chief executive Giancarlo Cimoli. Between 7,000 and 7,500 of remaining employees would work for AZ Fly and the rest would work for a second company, called AZ Service. The company did not confirm the proposal, but union leaders said Alitalia would announce the details next week. Alitalia, which is 62% state- owned, has gone into a dramatic downward spiral in the past 18 months and is losing \u20ac1.2m (\u00a3810,400) a day. Total losses were \u20ac329m in the first half of this year and \u20ac520m in 2003. The company has admitted this week that it has \u20ac72m liquid funds left, enough to pay its staff until only the end of this month. As management met unions yesterday, the share price fell to an all-time low of \u20ac0.187 before recovering to \u20ac0.1915 - a fall of 1.24% - in late afternoon trading. The share price has dropped by about 30% since the beginning of the year. The proposed job cuts may include 850 cabin crew and 300 pilots, according to Italian media reports. The company is also considering cutting basic pay by up to 50 % for remaining staff, reducing holidays and asking pilots to fly longer hours. Pilots' flying hours could be stretched from the standard eight to 13, taking their standard shift length from 13 to 17 hours, La Repubblica newspaper reported last week. Alitalia's management needs a union agreement by September 15 to unlock a \u20ac400m emergency loan. Otherwise, the government has warned it would be forced to put Alitalia into administration. Faced with the imminent threat of a company collapse, union leaders showed the first signs of accepting drastic plans for job and pay cuts. \"We're looking to save as many jobs as possible,\" said Salvino Pezzotta, leader of the Cisl union. \"We'll talk [with Alitalia] to find non-traumatic solutions.\" The government and the company have battled to keep the company afloat amid crippling strikes in recent months while other airlines have undercut the Italian carrier on standard long haul flights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
