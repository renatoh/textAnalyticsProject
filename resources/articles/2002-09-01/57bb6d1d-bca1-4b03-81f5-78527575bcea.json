The notable exception is Evesham Hotel, Evesham, Worcestershire, in all the guidebooks and known for its facilities for children. We recommend it for its excellent restaurant, vast range of drinks, lunchtime buffet, fun swimming pool, pleasant gardens, attentive staff and eccentric owner. A treat for anyone of any age, with or without children. Joan &amp; Tim Brown \u00b7 I've always been really impressed by the Evesham Hotel in Evesham who seem to have the balance about right. Teddy bear room keys, box of nappies etc in the room, great food, big play area and indoor swimming pool. We've been since our kids were babies. They're now 8 and 5 and they still love going. It just seems to work. You pay a certain amount per year of the child's life - it's very fair. Nicolle \u00b7 Both we and friends have had excellent holidays at Bedruthan Steps Hotel at Bedruthan Steps in Devon (01637 860555). Children's clubs are inclusive, so adults can enjoy a game of tennis etc child-free, as well as spending time with the whole family. Our children still talk about it as one of their best holidays ever. Martin &amp; Julie Osborne \u00b7 We stayed at the Old Park Hotel on the Isle of Wight. It is great for children, all the staff obviously liked kids, they had children's teatime, an indoor pool with a toddler pool, indoor and outdoor play areas, and it's own pebbly beach. Best of all, most of the rooms have separate attached rooms for the children with 4 beds so everybody can have quiet and privacy. In the evening there is baby listening and the food is really good. There's also a child-free (and TV-free) lounge for adults. It's fantastic value too. Ask for a room in the old style West Wing which is way more picturesque than the modern East Wing.
