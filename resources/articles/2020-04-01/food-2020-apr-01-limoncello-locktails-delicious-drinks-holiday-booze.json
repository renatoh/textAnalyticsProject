How to make delicious drinks from years-old holiday booze", "bodyText": "If you ever needed proof of the resilience of the human spirit (or just how much people love booze), the quarantini is exhibit A. Barely had we begun to lock down than #quarantini started trending across social media, with cooped-up drinkers retrieving dusty bottles from kitchen cupboards to create ingenious cocktails from limited ingredients. In that spirit (sorry), we asked some of Britain\u2019s best bartenders for simple tips on how best to use up holiday souvenir liqueurs, cocktail party leftovers and collections of sticky, obscure spirits. \u201cYou don\u2019t need fancy equipment,\u201d insists award-winning drinks whizz Jack Wakelin. \u201cNo jigger? Use an egg cup \u2013 it\u2019s about 30ml. No cocktail shaker? Use a cafeti\u00e8re \u2013 it\u2019s got a built-in strainer. No long spoon? A chopstick works as well.\u201d With all that in mind \u2026 cin-cin! Limoncello Max Venning, co-owner of Dalston\u2019s Three Sheets, riffs on a Collins, suggesting a large measure of this sweet Italian lemon liqueur and a squeeze of fresh lemon \u2013 \u201cit adds brightness\u201d \u2013 topped with sparkling water, soda or tonic. Slosh in a vodka for an extra kick. Cura\u00e7ao Frequently coloured vivid blue, this bitter orange-flavoured sweet liqueur is, arguably, the last word in naff. But bartenders like Wakelin, who is working on a new Sheffield bar, Bench, relish such a creative challenge. He would combine three parts cura\u00e7ao, triple-sec or Cointreau with two parts leftover white wine and one part soda over ice. \u201cIf you have one, add an olive.\u201d St-Germain This elderflower liqueur lends itself to what Yann Bouvignies, head bartender at the Rosewood hotel\u2019s Scarfe\u2019s Bar in London, describes as a \u201cwet martini\u201d with the \u201cfloral sweetness making it more approachable\u201d. Stir 15ml each of St-Germain and dry vermouth over ice with 45ml of gin, and wave goodbye to all mortal concerns. Ouzo (or similar) \u201cThis is like a mashup between a bramble and a G&amp;T, with a liquorice twist that reminds you of blackcurrant cough sweets,\u201d says Holly Tudor, cocktail development jedi (seriously, that\u2019s her job title) at the Alchemist bar group. Take 15ml of any aniseed spirit (sambuca, raki, pastis), 35ml gin, 15ml lemon juice, 25ml blackcurrant cordial and top with 100ml of soda. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it light \u2013 feel free to adjust it to your tastes.\u201d Cacha\u00e7a \u201cWhen you\u2019re sick of making caipirinhas, here\u2019s a Brazilian twist to your aperitif fizz,\u201d says Tudor: 25ml each of fermented sugar cane cacha\u00e7a, amaretto and lemon juice are mixed and topped with sparkling wine. \u201cThe wine\u2019s dryness cuts the cacha\u00e7a\u2019s sweetness.\u201d P\u00e1linka Bouvignies would utilise this Hungarian fruit brandy in something akin to a horse\u2019s neck cocktail (50ml p\u00e1linka, two dashes of Angostura bitter, ginger ale). Meanwhile, Erik Lorincz, owner of London\u2019s Kw\u00e3nt bar, sets it to work in a sour. Take 60ml of preferably peach or pear p\u00e1linka, 30ml lemon juice, 15ml sugar syrup (two parts sugar to one part water), an optional half an egg white, shake everything over ice and serve. Venning takes a different approach, mixing p\u00e1linka with a squeeze of lemon or orange juice over ice and topping that with chilled, sweetened earl grey tea: \u201cA really refreshing iced tea as the weather warms up.\u201d Cr\u00e8me de menthe Wakelin swaps fresh mint for cr\u00e8me in his take on a southside cocktail. Combine 45ml gin, 5ml cr\u00e8me, lime juice and a pinch of salt, then stir in sweetener: \u201cI\u2019m using one spoon of honey I\u2019ve had for ages. Sugar is fine.\u201d Add ice; top with tonic. At London\u2019s Darby\u2019s, bar manager Wes Yeung uses cr\u00e8me in Irish coffee. Whisk 10ml into double cream, brew 150ml of coffee, stir in a teaspoon of brown sugar and 35ml of whiskey. Then: \u201cOver the back of a spoon held against the glass just touching the coffee, float cream over the top.\u201d Retsina That pine-powered retsina you loved in Crete can taste like a slap in the chops back in Britain. Take the edge off it in a spritz. Add 25ml each of retsina and elderflower cordial, says the Goring hotel\u2019s Tiago Mira, a splash of soda and top with prosecco. Garnish with cucumber. For sweeter versions of retsina cocktails, Benoit Provost, manager at the Stafford London\u2019s American Bar, advises you use Greek mastika instead, a liqueur with a \u201cslightly pine, cedar-like flavour\u201d. Amarula This South African cream liqueur \u201cis a good alternative to Bailey\u2019s, if you like that sort of thing,\u201d says Provost, who, like Mira, uses it in a take on the espresso martini. Mira\u2019s recipe has 50ml of vodka, 25ml Amarula and a shot of espresso shaken over ice and served garnished with coffee beans. Amari This family of herbaceous, bitter Italian liqueurs, running from Campari to Fernet-Branca, is enjoying a moment in the UK. Often drunk neat, they are also the basis of Wakelin\u2019s version of a garibaldi, a simple drink of fresh orange aerated with a stick-blender until \u201cnice and fluffy\u201d, spiked with 50ml of your preferred amaro."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
