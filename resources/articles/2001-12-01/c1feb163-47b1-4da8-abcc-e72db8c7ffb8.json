Besides a potentially pivotal Champions League tie against Roma here tonight, G\u00e9rard Houllier's absence as he recovers from heart surgery, and the sale of Robbie Fowler to Leeds, the caretaker manager Phil Thompson had more bad news to gauge. Markus Babbel, his former German international defender who has not played since August after contracting a virus, has now been diagnosed as suffering from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The condition, which affects about 600 people a year in the United Kingdom, attacks the nervous system and its most debilitating strain, which moves up the body into the respiratory system, is life- threatening. The problem having been identified early, Liverpool are confident that danger will be averted. Babbel, 29, played an integral part in last term's treble cup success and scored in the Uefa Cup final. He is in hospital in Germany and, though his club remain publicly optimistic that he may yet play this season, realistically his career must be under considerable threat. \"He's had a reaction to the original virus and has gone back to Germany for treatment,\" said Thompson. \"For the moment, we've been told he'll be out for another three months. It's a big blow for Markus and the team. At least it has been diagnosed. I would like to think he won't be out for the whole of the season and that he can come back to play a vital part at the end of the campaign. We will see.\" The news overshadowed preparations for this evening's tie, which Liverpool can hardly afford to lose. Rather than dwell on the shortcomings exposed by Barcelona a fortnight ago, they will be heartened by memories of last season's Uefa Cup triumph against this opposition. Not that encouragement will slip into overconfidence. \"Home and away Roma were fantastic against us,\" said Thompson. \"We beat the best team in the competition. As it is, I'm looking forward to testing myself against Fabio Capello. He's a tremendous coach, lauded within Fifa and Uefa, and it will be a test to come up against him.\" Capello appeared less enamoured, dismissing Liverpool as \"only capable of playing one way\". His side have been eliminated from European competition by English clubs in the past two years: Michael Owen's brace proved decisive in the Uefa Cup last season as Liverpool progressed 2-1 on aggregate against the team Thompson insists were \"the best we played, in either the Premiership or Europe\". Much will depend on Owen tonight. The England striker has 24 goals in his last 20 club starts, though he still expects a striking masterclass from the Romans' talismanic Argentine Gabriel Batistuta. \"There are plenty of strikers around that I try and learn from - it's important not to try and copy them but just take the best bits and add them to your game,\" he said. \"But in the realm of making runs and finishing, Batistuta has been the best there is. \"I was watching a goal he scored for Roma [against Bologna] the other day. It may have looked simple but the runs he makes are so clever. Everything about it reminded me of Ian Rush. He is world class.\" Roma (probable, 4-4-2): Antonioli; Candela, Aldair, Samuel, Zago; Tommasi, Fuser, Emerson, Assuncao; Totti, Batistuta. Liverpool (probable, 4-4-2): Dudek; Carragher, Hyypia, Henchoz, Riise; Gerrard, Murphy, Hamann, Smicer; Owen, Heskey. Referee: D Jol (Holland). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
