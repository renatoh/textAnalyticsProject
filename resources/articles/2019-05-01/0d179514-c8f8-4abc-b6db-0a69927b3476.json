More than 40 women and charities including the End Violence Against Women and Girls Coalition declared in a letter to voters and community leaders in the north-west that they would not accept money from the English Defence League founder, criticising Robinson for \u201cfactually incorrect messages about grooming\u201d. Robinson \u2013 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2013 frequently singles out Muslims as being behind grooming gangs and has been accused of selectively publicising certain child sex abuse cases to promote a wider anti-Islam agenda. The coalition of women\u2019s groups said Robinson exploited the pain suffered by victims in a self-serving attempt to fuel racial hatred. \u201cWe, as organisations and individuals fighting tirelessly against the abuse of women and girls, as survivors of abuse and their families, and as people who care about our communities, do not want your money, Tommy,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThose who have suffered sexual and physical abuse were failed by those who should have protected them. But Tommy Robinson is no ally for the children he claims to stand up for. Tommy doesn\u2019t care about the rights of women and girls \u2013 he is exploiting the pain of survivors and their families to fuel racist hate for his own gain.\u201d It added: \u201cTommy Robinson\u2019s factually incorrect messages about grooming, and his attempt to portray himself as a champion of the cause, are an insult to survivors of abuse. \u201cThey are also a profound insult to the women who have spent their whole lives building support services for survivors and working to ensure some cases finally got to court. Where were you during that work Tommy Robinson?\u201d Signatories also included author and Women for Refugee Women founder Natasha Walter, Rape Crisis Surrey and Sussex, Rape Crisis South London, the Women\u2019s Centre Cornwall and Gurpreet Virdee, a director at the Women and Girls Network. Announcing the commitment two weeks ago in a YouTube video as part of his campaign to become an independent MEP in the north-west, Robinson criticised \u201carrogant\u201d politicians on a \u201cgravy train with no end in sight\u201d as he announced he would not keep earnings from being an MEP, if he were elected. \u201cThey need to think of the victims, not of their own politicisation of the situation, that money is to go to any victims of sexual exploitation, including Muslims,\u201d Robinson said of the letter\u2019s signatories. \u201cThey are in no position to turn down money, they shouldn\u2019t be. They should be in the position to help victims and if that money helps victims, which it does, gets them off the waiting list for counselling, then they are playing with the victims, not me.\u201d Matthew McGregor, from anti-racism campaigners Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cThis is one of Tommy Robinson\u2019s most cynical stunts. Abuse survivors don\u2019t need someone whose main interest is in funding his already lavish lifestyle and spreading hatred.\u201d In the weeks since launching his campaign for the 23 May election to become an MEP on a monthly salary of about \u00a37,500 before tax, Robinson has twice been struck by milkshakes and police are investigating a number of alleged assaults that occurred during his recent visit to Warrington. The far-right activist has been funded by a number of rightwing organisations around the world and claims to have raised several hundred thousand pounds via online donations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
