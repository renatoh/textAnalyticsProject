Luckily, \"You don't need to speak French to understand Parisians,\" according to its new initiative at cestsoparis.com. It features a visual dictionary of French gestures, including the classic moue and the, er, internationally recognised \"Let's phone each other\" action. Here are the fruits of my own intensive research in Parisian cafes, which will have you looking like a native in no time. The corkscrew: make a loose fist with one hand and hold it in front of your nose, with the eye of the fist (the centre of the spiral made by thumb and forefinger) pointing directly at your face. Now rotate your fist gently 45 degrees back and forth around the eye, as though you are trying to unscrew your nose with an invisible tool. Translation: \"This guy is a steaming alcoholic.\" The bof: ram your lower lip upwards and the corners of your mouth downwards, while raising your shoulders and eyebrows. Translation: \"Bof!\" The C'est So Paris site rather unkindly says that this is used to \"deny knowledge, agreement or responsibility\". I prefer to think of the untranslatable \"Bof!\" as an expression of benign cosmopolitan irony in the face of a patently absurd universe. Rigorous practice may inculcate this enviable spirit of Gallic Zen. The balls: grab your balls (or pretend balls) with one hand, and shake. Translation: \"Tu te touches!\", ie you're touching yourself, ie you have a highly flattering self-image mysteriously not shared by those around you. Not guaranteed to assure good service if directed at a waiter, however true it might be. The pffft: out of the corner of your mouth, blow upwards into your hair, while raising your eyes to heaven. Translation: \"Tu me gongles!\", ie you are very boring and/or annoying. The effect is more dramatic if you have an adorable fringe. Still won't help you with waiters, though. The plop: a close cousin to the bof but with added sound-effects. Puff your cheeks out, then let the air escape with a plop (not a fart) through your lips. Various combinations of shrugging and eyebrow-raising may be added to taste. Translation: \"Bof!\" Hint: do not attempt this with a cigarette in your mouth, or you may set yourself on fire and your frantic attempts to smother the flames will destroy your image of indigenous cool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
