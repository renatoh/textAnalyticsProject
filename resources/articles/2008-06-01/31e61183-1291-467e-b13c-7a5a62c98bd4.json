It is therefore doubly disappointing that Attachment is both so unambitious and inconsequential ... This is a stock Hampstead novel recast for the age of globalisation.\" \"On the face of it, the story is as worn as a second-hand dress,\" agreed Kate Kellaway in the Observer. \"It is about midlife - ageing parents, a breast cancer scare, a marriage on the rocks. But Fonseca's voice - poised, particular, exotic - rises above her plot.\" However, \"Fonseca will have to guard against readers who suppose it to be about her marriage to Martin Amis.\" \"Like Jean [her heroine], Isabel Fonseca is an American who lived in the tropics (Uruguay) with an English husband, Martin Amis,\" wrote Jessica Mann in the Sunday Telegraph. \"Whether the rest of the book is based on fact or not, the description of Jean's long march to maturity rings true, and the writing is lucid and sensitive.\" \"Hugh Trevor-Roper takes three aspects of Scottishness - the origins of the nation, the antiquity of Scottish literature and, most entertainingly, the reasons for wearing tartan - and demolishes them one by one,\" declared Simon Heffer in the Daily Telegraph, reviewing The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History. \"He points out that an Englishman essentially invented the kilt, something too horrible for the Scots to confront ... While it would be wrong to conclude that the whole Scottish image and culture is based on lies, Trevor-Roper, in this vastly entertaining and highly intelligent book, does lead us some considerable way in that direction.\" \"This witty, ironic and elegantly written book will delight any reader with an open mind,\" said Adam Sisman in the Sunday Telegraph. \"This is not a book about Scotland, but about the persistence of myth.\" \"There were whispers of nepotism when this debut novel by John le Carr\u00e9's son was bought for a reputed \u00a3300,000 last year,\" observed Doug Johnstone in the Independent on Sunday, reviewing Nick Harkaway's debut novel. \"But on reading this magnificent, sprawling, epic work, it's clear it was published on its own merits, and is probably worth considerably more than the amount Heinemann paid for it ... The Gone-Away World could easily become a modern classic.\" \"The agility of the narrative is one of the great strengths of this book,\" said Sarah Vine in the Times. \"Particularly effective are his Matrix-like fight scenes ... This is clever sci-fi with a light heart and a winning smile: a killer combination.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
