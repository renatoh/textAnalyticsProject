If you've never seen him live, his new DVD will show you there's actually some substance behind the hype. \"My life is essentially a series of embarrassing incidents strung together by telling people about those embarrassing incidents,\" he says, and the papers play a part. One of his best routines is about a recent tabloid kiss and tell. He talks about his run-ins with Bob Geldof and Rod Stewart, but there's more to his act than showbiz gossip. \"Freud says that sexuality is the essential self,\" he says. \"Who you are when you're fucking is who you are in your soul.\" And that, not celebrity scandal, is the essence of his narcissistic yet entertaining stand-up. \u00b7 Grand Opera House, Sat 9 &amp; Sun 10; Russell Brand - Live, \u00a319.99 Shappi Khorsandi London Talk about a tough job. In the early 1980s, Hadi Khorsandi was a satirist in Iran. When he wrote witty articles criticising the Ayatollah, Hezbollah called for his execution. Hadi fled to Britain and brought his family with him, and so his daughter Shappi became a refugee long before it became fashionable. However, in 1984 Scotland Yard discovered a plot to assassinate Hadi, right here in the UK. Gunmen had been sent here to shoot him, so Hadi and his family went into hiding, under police protection. Luckily, the gunmen were running late, and luckier still, they went to the wrong address. Nevertheless, Shappi's family still had to check under their car for car bombs every day. Remarkably this didn't deter Shappi from pursuing a career in comedy, and today's she's one of Britain's brightest up-and-coming comics. You may have seen her on Question Time last month, but she's a lot funnier doing stand-up. Don't miss her solo show, Asylum Speaker, about a subject she knows all about. \u00b7 Soho Theatre, W1, Thu 14 to Dec 23 Jeff Green On tour/Book Jeff Green winds up his latest stand-up tour this week, and if you can't be there to see him off, why not check out his new book? What, not another book by a stand up comic? Aren't they all writing books nowadays? And aren't most of them the sort of vanity tat that would never be published if their authors weren't vaguely famous? Well yes, but Green's book's not like that. It's not a navelgazing novel, for a start. It's a lighthearted guide to parenthood, and if you're planning on being anywhere near a baby in the near future, you'll find it's perfect for whiling away an hour or two - in the unlikely event that you ever have an hour or two to spare. The A-Z Of Having A Baby is a sequel to The A-Z Of Being Single and The A-Z Of Living Together. Full of breezy bon mots, it's pleasant and unpretentious - a lot like his live act. \u00b7 City Limits, Cork, Sun 10; Windsor Arts Centre, Wed 13; The A-Z Of Having A Baby, Sphere, \u00a36.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
