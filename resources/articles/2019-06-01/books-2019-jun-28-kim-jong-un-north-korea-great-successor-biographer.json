It was a state that had survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, the death of its lionised founder, a famine, and the transformation of China, its last remaining benefactor. But many predicted that the Kim family\u2019s luck had finally run out. \u201cNorth Korea as we know it is over,\u201d a former Korea adviser to President George W Bush declared. I, too, could not fathom how this dynasty could accomplish the unprecedented transition to a third generation. Since my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005 and North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test the following year, I had seen its decrepit economy crumble further and its international isolation deepen. I had talked to escapees from North Korea about the profound deprivations of life inside the country and witnessed their visceral hatred for the Kim regime. I had watched as the regime fast-tracked the preparations for the succession, squeezing into two years what it had spent 25 years doing when preparing the populace for the transition from Kim Il-sung to Kim Jong-il. It was in 2009 that North Koreans first began hearing about the \u201cLeader Comrade\u201d Kim Jong-un. They were told he had \u201cPaektu blood\u201drunning through his veins, a reference to the mountain in the north of the country that supposedly conferred divine status on the family. The regime\u2019s propagandists didn\u2019t go as far as they had with his father \u2013 they said a bright star appeared in the sky the night Kim Jong-il was supposedly born on Mount Paektu \u2013 but they did make up some fanciful stories. They said that Kim Jong-un could fire a gun and hit a lightbulb 100 metres away at age three, that by the time he was eight, he could not only drive a truck but he could drive it at 80 miles an hour. Surely the military top brass and party officials who had supported his grandfather and then his father would not tolerate this young upstart? Surely the North Korean people, many of whom had now seen smuggled South Korean soap operas and Chinese action films and knew that the outside world was a much better place, would not stomach him? Yet when I returned to North Korea in 2014, , my first trip since Kim Jong-un had taken over, I found that the Great Successor was not just surviving but thriving. Pyongyang had a new Potemkin facade. There were high-rise buildings going up, a German beer hall and cafes selling cappuccinos with little bear faces in the foam. There was a sense of aspiration and an air of leisure that I\u2019d never felt before. This section of the showcase capital, home to those most loyal to the regime, was now sometimes called \u201cPyonghattan\u201d. Beyond the facades, things were still broken. The ordinary housing areas were very run-down, and even these fancy new buildings didn\u2019t have enough power to pump the water or run the lifts. The most sought-after apartments are on the low floors because no one wants to carry their shopping up 20 flights of stairs. But it was clear that Kim Jong-un was trying to make sure that the 1%, those who keep the regime in power, had reason to be loyal. Contrary to the popular perception of a cartoonish amateur, Kim Jong-un has proved to be calculating and ruthless. I wanted to find out everything there was to know about this man. I wanted to know how he sleeps at night given the brutal things he has done in power. To find out, I sought out anyone who had ever met him. I interviewed the Japanese chef who moved to North Korea to make sushi for the ruling family. Kim Jong-un had an isolated, lonely childhood, so from the age of six, he latched on to the eccentric sushi master. They would listen to Whitney Houston on the chef\u2019s Walkman, fly kites and go fishing together. Kim Jong-un would grab the rod out of the chef\u2019s hand and claim the credit for catching the fish. I found his aunt and uncle who had been his guardians when he went to school in Switzerland at the age of 12. They posed as his parents there. They described to me a teenager who was obsessed with planes and engines, and then with basketball, sleeping with his ball and playing every day after school. At his eighth birthday party, they told me, he was presented with a little general\u2019s uniform and it was announced he would be his father\u2019s heir. Real generals saluted him, top party officials bowed to him. While the rest of the country lived in abject poverty, Kim Jong-un lived in palatial compounds filled with Sony televisions, pinball machines and grand pianos. The kitchens brimmed with French pastries, smoked salmon and pat\u00e9, mangos and melons. The Kim children wore clothes made especially for them with British fabric that arrived by the Samsonite suitcase load. They brushed their teeth with imported Colgate. While famine ravaged his home country, the teenage Kim Jong-un went to basketball games in Paris, swam in the Mediterranean and skied in the Swiss Alps. All the while, his mother, North Korea\u2019s de facto first lady and a woman who had high ambitions for her children, made sure her sons would have all the training they needed to take over the family business \u2013 and to edge out Kim Jong-il\u2019s oldest son, by a different mother, Kim Jong-nam. After they returned from Switzerland, she sent them to North Korea\u2019s premier military academy, one named after their grandfather, so they could stake a claim to leading this \u201cmilitary first\u201d regime. And thanks to her hard work and his natural aptitude, Kim Jong-un rose to the top and was unveiled in 2009 as his father\u2019s successor. Despite the caricature of him as madman, Kim Jong-un has approached his task with surprising savvy. He has operated in a textbook way for a dictator who is hellbent on staying in power. To treat him as a joke is to underestimate the threat that he poses both to the outside world and also, on a daily basis, to the 25 million people of North Korea. By allowing senior officials to use their positions to enrich themselves, he has created a class of kleptocrats who have a vested interest in his regime. Military officials run construction projects, taking a cut from the Chinese investors. Managers of defunct factories rent space to entrepreneurs seeking to produce everything from canned fish to methamphetamine. Officials sent abroad to manage North Korean labourers for the regime line their pockets on the side. He has made sure that their children, the millennials of Pyonghattan, enjoy some of the trappings of wealth that they might have if they lived in Beijing or Seoul. They take selfies with their smartphones, swing their Gucci purses, watch Disney cartoons in the gym as they work out. Many of the treadmills bear little red plaques stating that they were supplied by the respected and beloved comrade Kim Jong-un, just to make sure they don\u2019t forget to whom they owe this lifestyle. But it\u2019s not enough to create loyalty. He has also made sure to instil fear into these elites. When he took over the family business in 2011, he had the advice of senior officials who had supported his father and grandfather. This North Korean brains trust helped him navigate his first years in power. There was the head of the military, the powerful propaganda chief, and his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was focused on the economy and relations in China. But the same people who could assist him could also potentially build their own powerbases and challenge him. So once they had served their purpose, he got rid of them. The head of the army disappeared. The propaganda chief, too. But Uncle Jang didn\u2019t just vanish. He was publicly hauled out of a Communist party meeting and denounced in state media as \u201cdespicable human scum\u201d. A few days later, he was executed. Kim Jong-un was sending a message: don\u2019t even think about crossing me. He reinforced this message in spectacular fashion in 2017, when he had his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, very painfully and publicly killed with a chemical weapon in Kuala Lumpur airport. During the course of reporting this book, I uncovered another reason why Kim Jong-un may have wanted his half-brother dead. Kim Jong-nam had become an informant for the CIA. He would meet his handlers in various parts of south-east Asia and provide them with information about the regime. Although he had no relationship with his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam still had contacts with senior figures in the regime and could have provided valuable information to the Americans. As for the general population, he has continued the system of all-encompassing surveillance and repression. As many as 120,000 people are held in political prison camps in the mountains, where they must work in mines or do other hard labour for very little food. It is a vast gulag. Anyone who questions Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or, say, why he is spending so much on the nuclear programme when North Koreans still struggle to get enough food can find themselves consigned there for years. And Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t just throw the so-called perpetrators into these camps, but three generations of their families. A dissenter must be willing to risk not just their own life to criticise the regime, but the lives of their parents and their spouse and children, too. For this reason, there are no dissidents in North Korea. There\u2019s no equivalent of Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese human rights activist and Nobel laureate who died in prison. There\u2019s no North Korean Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, documenting life in the gulags. There\u2019s not even graffiti. Punishment is so severe that, as one woman who\u2019d made it out told me, you can\u2019t try to change the system, you can only try to escape it. That is why, after studying Kim Jong-un these past four years, I concluded that he\u2019s not likely to disappear soon. He has proved to be surprisingly strategic: he has nuclear weapons and has allowed a more market-based economy to grow. His grandfather lived to the age of 82. His father made it to 70. Kim Jong-un is now 35. There is no end in sight for the people of North Korea. \u2022 The Great Successor: The Secret Rise and Rule of Kim Jong Un by Anna Fifield is published by John Murray (RRP \u00a314.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
