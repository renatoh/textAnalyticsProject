Refuting a press statement issued by Channel 4 today, Jeevesh Nandan, a senior official at the mammoth gathering of Hindu devotees, said: \"The status quo continues. It is true that Channel 4's press passes are still valid, but a final decision is yet to be taken. The decision will be taken in a day or two.\" A panel consisting of two Indian officials and a local journalist viewed footage of the channel's daily coverage today. The move came following what MR Nandan described as \"information we got here from various sources that there were a lot of protests from Indians in the UK about Channel 4's coverage of the event\". Several press representatives were injured in a police baton charge in media centre at Kumbh site this evening. The two groups clashed over the ban imposed by the administration over filming of the pilgrims at the bathing areas. Asked whether they had received any complaints, a Channel 4 spokesperson said: \"I've not had any complaints.\" She further insisted: \"Our producers have taken our footage to the administrators at the mela and were given the green signal.\" The spokesman later admitted that there had been a complaint from the National Council of Hindu Temples."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
