When his Manchester United side renew acquaintance with Bayern Munich in Group A of the Champions League tomorrow, the European champions will be smarting from their first defeat in the Bundesliga since July. Bayern went down 1-0 to mid-table Werder Bremen on Saturday, a loss that sees them surrender the Bundesliga top spot to unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen, the side from Champions League Group D. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger should take note. Even more pressing for Arsenal, however, will be the form of his opponents on Wednesday, Deportivo la Coruna. A stunning hat-trick from the in-form Roy Makaay helped the Spanish league leaders to a comfortable 3-1 home win over Real Sociedad. Barcelona, lying third in Spain, go to Anfield tomorrow for their opening Group B match on the back of a 0-0 draw with lowly Las Palmas. Roma, who also feature in Liverpool's group, played out a goalless Serie A draw with second-placed Internazionale who visit Portman Road on Thursday to take on Ipswich in the Uefa Cup third round. Grasshoppers, Leeds's opponents on Thursday, moved up to fifth in Switzerland after a 4-2 win at Lausanne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
