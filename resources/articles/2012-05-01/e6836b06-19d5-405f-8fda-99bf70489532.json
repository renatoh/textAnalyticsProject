Money to spend The board maintain that he can have whatever he needs, although they do not intend to swell the coffers by selling Robin van Persie. Keeping the captain is the priority for the summer. What they need The squad is pretty well stocked but world-class additions to raise the level are always welcome. A fully fit Jack Wilshere will feel like a new midfield signing. What they will get Wenger does not anticipate doing much. Perhaps one marque creative signing can be hoped for. He has already added the striker Lukas Podolski. Targets Jan Vertonghen (Ajax), Junior Hoilett (Blackburn Rovers), Shinji Kagawa (Borussia Dortmund), Yann M'Vila (Rennes). Aston Villa Managerial situation Clear as mud. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer withdrew his interest last week. Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Brendan Rodgers and Paul Lambert are on their shortlist but approaches for any of those three would not be straightforward. Money to spend \u00a310m. Villa will spend a decent wedge in an attempt to avoid another relegation scare but they also need to reduce the wage bill. What they need Where to start? Villa need strengthening just about everywhere through the team but especially in central midfield. What they will get Uncertainty until a manager is in place. Then the club face a busy summer of ins and outs. Targets Danny Guthrie (Newcastle United). Chelsea Managerial situation Roman Abramovich and his board expect to make progress on the identity of their new manager in the next fortnight as the interim first\u2011team coach, Roberto Di Matteo, sees his contract tick down towards its 30 June conclusion. Pep Guardiola still tops the oligarch's list of favoured candidates. Money to spend As much as they need. What they need They have preached evolution rather than revolution, but three of their European Cup winners have been released, with a striker to replace Didier Drogba, an inventive midfielder and a right\u2011back the priorities. What they will get All three of the above. Marko Marin has already joined from Werder Bremen. Targets Radamel Falcao (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), Edinson Cavani (Napoli), Eden Hazard (Lille), Hulk (Porto), Gonzalo Higua\u00edn (Real Madrid), Lucas Moura (Sao Paulo), Gregory van der Wiel (Ajax), Cesar Azpilicueta (Marseille), Milos Krasic (Juventus). Everton Managerial situation David Moyes has held several meetings with the chairman, Bill Kenwright, about a new contract since the end of the season. His Premier League options reduced when the FA appointed Roy Hodgson, not Harry Redknapp, as England manager and 12 months are remaining on his contract. Money to spend Around \u00a36m transformed Everton in January and Moyes believes another modest outlay is all that is required to freshen and improve the squad this summer. Whether he will get even a modest sum, however, may rest on player sales and the demands of the bank. What they need To re\u2011sign Steven Pienaar on a permanent basis from Tottenham Hotspur, a new partner for Nikica Jelavic and to keep Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines at the club. What they will get Another anxious summer as the club look to balance the books. Targets Steven Pienaar (Spurs), Bjorn Bergmann Sigurdarson (Lillestrom), Nick Powell (Crewe), Steven Naismith (Rangers). Fulham Managerial situation Martin Jol ended up enjoying a fine first season at Craven Cottage and seems settled. Money to spend Mohamed al Fayed has never been afraid of spending heavily, as the \u00a39.5m arrival of Bryan Ruiz proved. What they need Freshening up. Jol has steadily been overhauling the squad he inherited from Roy Hodgson and Mark Hughes, and has succeeded in making changes while maintaining Fulham's challenge as a mid-table top\u2011flight club. Subtle changes can be anticipated, though much could depend upon whether Clint Dempsey stays. What they will get They will have to find a player capable of scoring heavily, as Dempsey did, and there will be interest, too, in Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Both players may have to be replaced. Targets Pavel Pogrebnyak (free agent), Jordan Rhodes (Huddersfield), Chris Gunter (Nottingham Forest), Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace), Hugo Rodallega (free agent), Matt Jarvis (Wolves), Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea), Emmanuel Mayuka (Young Boys), Cameron Jerome (Stoke City), Burak Yilmaz (Trabzonspor). Liverpool Managerial situation Up in the air. Having sacked Kenny Dalglish, almost two weeks ago the club's owners are involved in a complicated process of installing a new management structure. Money to spend Liverpool have pledged that the new man will have money to spend and strong commercial revenues should provide \u00a320m-\u00a340m. What they need As Dalglish will no doubt lament, a proven goalscorer. Liverpool hit the woodwork 29 times in the Premier League last season and better finishing could have saved their manager's job. More quality and pace on the wings, more finesse on the ball in central midfield and, depending on contract talks with Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel, a dominant central defender may also be required. What they will get As last summer's pursuits of Phil Jones and Ashley Young brought home, Liverpool are not a first\u2011choice destination in the absence of Champions League football. That said, they should have the pull and the money to address several weaknesses. Targets Sochaux winger Ryad Boudebouz claimed at the weekend that Liverpool have opened talks with his agent but targets will depend on the identity of the new manager and/or sporting director. Manchester City Managerial situation Roberto Mancini has just delivered a first title in 44 years for the Blues and he is about to sign a fresh three- or four\u2011year deal. The Italian's power at the club has never been greater. Money to spend Despite Uefa's Financial Fair Play supposedly limiting City's ability to splurge Sheikh Mansour's billions this summer expect two or three high-profile, very expensive signings. So Mancini's war chest could be still north of \u00a3150m when salaries and extras are factored in. What they need Two central defenders, a creative midfielder, a holding midfielder, maybe three strikers \u2013 as Carlos Tevez, Edina Dzeko and Mario Balotelli may all leave \u2013 and a deputy left-back. What they will get All the above. Targets Eden Hazard (Lille), Robin van Persie (Arsenal), Leighton Baines (Everton), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Milan), Thiago Silva (Milan), Cheik Tiot\u00e9 (Newcastle), Yohan Cabaye (Newcastle), Michael Dawson (Tottenham), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal), Adriano (Barcelona), Stephen Warnock (Aston Villa), Wesley Sneijder (Internazionale), Robert Lewandowski (Borussia Dortmund), Jermain Defoe (Spurs), Papiss Ciss\u00e9 (Newcastle). Manchester United Managerial situation Sir Alex Ferguson is the only manager in the league who can name the day he walks and this appears a distant prospect though Dave Whelan predicted the Scot's recent health scare means he could retire at the close of next season. Ferguson has vowed to meet the challenge of Manchester City by regaining the title, so the possibility remains that, if he guides United to their 20th \u2013 his 13th crown \u2013 he may depart. Money to spend With net debt having risen by \u00a326m and total revenue down 5% it appears not much, though there is a sense that Ferguson might have funds for one marquee signing \u2013 say a Luka Modric or Wesley Sneidjer. What they need A creative midfielder to replace Paul Scholes, despite him playing on another season; a left\u2011back as Patrice Evra's deputy, Fabio should go on loan. Two strikers \u2013 Michael Owen has been released and Dimitar Berbatov will be sold. What they will get An attacking midfielder and goalscorer of potential plus a second, more unheralded forward. A back\u2011up left\u2011back. Targets Eden Hazard (Lille), Shiniji Kagawa (Borussia Dortmund), Leighton Baines (Everton), Wesley Sneijder (Inter), Luka Modric (Spurs), Clint Dempsey (Fulham), Robin van Persie (Arsenal), Robert Lewandowski (Borussia Dortmund), Jermain Defoe (Spurs). Newcastle United Managerial situation Unusually stable. Alan Pardew is on a long\u2011term contract and, after finishing fifth last season, everyone is happy. The only dangers are another club trying to poach Pardew or the latter falling out with the owner, Mike Ashley. Money to spend Ashley keeps his cards close to his chest but the sum is likely to be modest unless Newcastle cash in on a star performer such as Cheik Tiot\u00e9. Pardew should also be able to reinvest the proceeds from offloading fringe players such as Danny Guthrie, Leon Best, Nile Ranger and Peter Lovenkrands. What they need A specialist left\u2011back (Davide Santon is likely to switch to right\u2011back next season), another central defender, an extra cover striker. What they will get Newcastle excel at smart wheeling and dealing these days so they should get pretty much what they want. With the club no longer offering top wages much recent scouting has taken place in the Netherlands, so expect a few Dutch imports. Targets Erik Pieters (PSV Eindhoven), Douglas (FC Twente) Luke de Jong (FC Twente), Nicolai Boilesen (Ajax), Jan Vertonghen (Ajax, but only if his move to Spurs collapses), Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace). Norwich City Managerial situation Paul Lambert's recent media appearances have featured a frosty Scot having to take questions about a possible move to Aston Villa. His responses suggest the answer is yes, though this may depend on whether Roberto Mart\u00ednez lands the Liverpool job. Money to spend Norwich's relative lack of cash means whoever is manager may have \u00a310m-\u00a315m in total. Most of the Canaries' business will consist of removing players to get fresh faces in, plus free transfers and clever loan signings. What they need A 17\u2011goal striker \u2013 if Grant Holt gets his transfer out of the club \u2013 plus a replacement for fellow forward Aaron Wilbraham. Possibly a keeper, depending on how John Ruddy's recovery from his broken finger, plus two defenders as Zak Whitebread has left and Adam Drury is out of contract and may be moved on. What they will get All the above apart from a striker with Holt's number of goals as they are scarce on the kind of money Norwich have. Targets Jordan Rhodes (Huddersfield), Titus Bramble (Sunderland), Leroy Lita (Swansea), Ricardo Rocha (Portsmouth), David Stockdale (Fulham), Dedryck Boyata (Manchester City). Queens Park Rangers Managerial situation Mark Hughes's appointment was justified by the club's survival on the season's final day. He will hope his board match his own ambitions from now on in. Money to spend Tony Fernandes has already spent heavily and will be prepared to do so again. What they need Work was done in January to make this team more of a Hughes side but further additions will be needed throughout if they are to get mid-table security next time around. What they will get A new goalkeeper, possibly even Shay Given from Aston Villa, and strength in defence, midfield and up front. The likes of Joey Barton and possibly even Adel Taarabt may join the exodus away from Loftus Road. Targets Shay Given (Villa), Robert Green (West Ham), Junior Hoilett (Blackburn), Jermaine Jenas (Spurs), Wayne Hennessey (Wolves), Taye Taiwo (Milan), Matt Jarvis (Wolves), Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace), Kenwyne Jones (Stoke City), Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace), Jermain Defoe (Spurs). Reading Managerial situation Brian McDermott shrugged off the disappointment of defeat in the 2011 Championship play\u2011off final to lead the club up as champions, on the back of a run of 15 wins in 17 matches. Money to spend Prudence will remain the watchword. What they need McDermott has had to tread the fine line between keeping faith in those players who got the club promoted and adding the extra quality required. He does not envisage making wholesale changes, suggesting four or five top-level signings would suffice. What they will get The free transfer of the winger Gareth McCleary from Nottingham Forest has been completed. The club will look to add hungry players with everything to prove at the top level. They will also vie for established talent. Targets Carlos Sanchez (Valenciennes), Joe Cole (Lille), Jermain Defoe (Spurs), Yakubu Ayegbeni (Blackburn Rovers). Southampton Managerial situation Six years ago, Nigel Adkins was Scunthorpe United's physiotherapist. Now, he is a Premier League manager, after masterminding successive promotions. He has credit in the bank at the club. Money to spend The executive chairman, Nicola Cortese, said he wanted the club to become self-financing in the Premier League and reliant on homegrown players. What they need Pace out wide, support up front and extra quality in centre-midfield; top\u2011level experience and a few more numbers. They may face a fight to keep Adam Lallana, the skilful midfielder. They must win it. What they will realistically get In the words of Adkins 'a certain calibre of player \u2026 players that are better than we've got'. Targets Matt Jarvis (Wolves), Jay Rodriguez (Burnley), Scott Dann (Blackburn), Kevin Doyle (Wolves), Thomas Ince (Blackpool). Stoke City Managerial situation Tony Pulis is as safe as houses. Money to spend \u00a37m. The purse strings will be tighter at the club this summer after they splashed \u00a320m on deadline day last August. The Stoke chairman, Peter Coates, would like to see some academy players coming through to lessen the burden on his chequebook. What they need The Potters are keen on securing another left\u2011back. Blackburn Rovers' Marcus Olsson has been watched. What they will get A less eyebrow-raising summer than last year. Targets Marcus Olsson (Blackburn Rovers), Matt Jarvis (Wolverhampton Wanderers). Sunderland Managerial situation Martin O'Neill is preparing for his first full season in charge with a bid for Europa Cup qualification and/or domestic cup success regarded as realistic aims. Money to spend Ellis Short, Sunderland's owner, is big on discretion so only senior club officials know the answer. Short, though, is conscious of Uefa's new rules and impending introduction of financial fair play regulations and will almost certainly encourage O'Neill to sell before he buys. What they need At least one centre\u2011forward, a left\u2011back, a centre\u2011half and a creative central midfielder. What they will get If O'Neill can prune a large squad there is no reason why he cannot place ticks against every item on his shopping list. Doing so may involve selling the much coveted St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon, though. Targets Fernando Llorente (Athletic Bilbao), Grant Holt (Norwich), Junior Hoilett (Blackburn), Richard Dunne (Villa) Gabriel Agbonlahor (Villa), Stephen Warnock (Villa). Swansea City Managerial situation Although Swansea's board remain confident of keeping Brendan Rodgers for at least another season, he is attracting interest from not only Liverpool but, reportedly, Roma. Money to spend Rodgers has warned fans not to expect 'big money signings' this summer but, nonetheless, expects to spend modestly, with the total outlay nlikely to exceed \u00a310m. What they need Rodgers has said he aims to sign 'three or four new players' and thereby freshen up his arguably over-achieving squad in an attempt to avoid \"second season\" syndrome. What they will get Gylfi Sigurdsson is close to making his loan switch from Hoffenheim permanent, Steven Caulker could arrive on loan from Spurs for a second season and there should be at least two or three new faces. Rodgers though could struggle to retain players such as Danny Graham, Nathan Dyer, Scott Sinclair and Leon Britton who impressed last season. Targets Jon Guidetti (Man City, season-long loan) Jay Rodriguez (Burnley), Matt Phillips (Blackpool). Tottenham Managerial situation Harry Redknapp has one year left on his contract and, so far, there have been no negotiations over an extension. Redknapp must recharge after a gruelling season, not least on a personal level. Money to spend Money will be made available for fees, in the region of \u00a330m, but the biggest issue is whether the chairman, Daniel Levy, can raise the \u00a370,000 weekly wage ceiling. That will determine the calibre of new recruits and the morale of the squad's existing stars. What they need Despite their numbers in central defence, Redknapp wants a top\u2011quality player in the position. He also needs a centre\u2011forward, who can lead the line on his own. What they will get Close to signing the Ajax centre\u2011half Jan Vertonghen. Attempts are on-going to secure Emmanuel Adebayor permanently. Targets Jan Vertonghen (Ajax), Emmanuel Adebayor (Man City), Loic R\u00e9my (Marseille), Junior Hoilett (Blackburn). West Bromwich Albion Managerial situation Facing a tough task in replacing Roy Hodgson. Birmingham City's Chris Hughton is the bookies' favourite but the club held further talks with Claudio Ranieri last week. Portsmouth's Michael Appleton has also been linked. The club have said they would like to make an appointment before the end of the month. Money to spend \u00a35m. The new man is not going to have a lavish transfer fund to spend and will have to keep his eyes peeled for a bargain. What they need A central midfielder to replace the departed Paul Scharner and maybe a centre-half if Jonas Olsson leaves the club. What they will get Another summer of bargain-hunting. Targets Pending confirmation of a new manager. West Ham United Managerial situation Sam Allardyce achieved his target of leading West Ham back to the Premier League at the first attempt and will have the chance to re\u2011establish the club in the top flight. Money to spend There will be funding available and the board will appreciate the need to strengthen a team that could only finish third in the Championship. What they need Strengthening down the spine of the team, squad bolstering given the number of players who have been released and to convince the England goalkeeper Rob Green to sign a new contract at Upton Park. What they will get They should be competitive, with Allardyce tempted no doubt to secure players who have played in the Premier League before as well as wheeling and dealing for bargains. He has forged himself a reputation for turning cast\u2011offs into gems. Targets Joe Cole (Liverpool), Bas Dost (Heerenveen), Joey Barton (QPR), Jay Rodriguez (Burnley), Craig Gordon (free agent), Victor Moses (Wigan), Steven N'Zonzi (Blackburn), Jordan Rhodes (Huddersfield), Ahmed Elmohamady (Sunderland), Paul Robinson (Blackburn), Jussi Jaaskelainen (Bolton), George McCartney (Sunderland). Wigan Athletic Managerial situation Entirely dependent on whether Roberto Mart\u00ednez decides he can work within the new management structure at Liverpool or can rebuild Aston Villa. Wigan have not given up hope of keeping the coveted Spaniard at the DW Stadium. Money to spend Mart\u00ednez will want an improved transfer budget from chairman Dave Whelan to stay and to ensure next season is not another relegation struggle. Around \u00a310m. What they need At least four recruits to replace the out-of-contract Hugo Rodallega, Mohamed Diam\u00e9, Steve Gohouri and Chris Kirkland. What they will get Mart\u00ednez has said four replacements are lined up and indicated some are involved at the European Championship but whether he will be around to complete the deals remains to be seen. Targets Like Liverpool, the identity of the club's transfer targets rests on where Mart\u00ednez decides to work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
