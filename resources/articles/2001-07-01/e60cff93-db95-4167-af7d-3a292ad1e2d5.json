Those who succeeded embraced what generally remain timeless songs while giving something of themselves, without self-aggrandisement. Chris Rea's coruscating guitar and growly vocals underscored the glorious On Broadway's latent menace and bitterness; Pink Floyd's David Gilmour was plaintive on Don't. Heather Small brought rare drama to I (Who Have Nothing) and Jane Monheit a dash of sex to I'm a Woman. As befits such a middling event, outright failures were rare. Mark Lamarr's Framed confirmed that he is no more a singer than Suggs is a television presenter, while the Magnets' a cappella Searchin' had the rare effect of evoking fond memories of the Flying Pickets. During Yakety Yak, the casually offensive ad-libs of so-called \"fuhrer of fun\" Brian Conley (\"Don't fold your arms love, you'll curdle your milk\") were skin-crawlingly embarrassing reminders of a bygone age when \"birds\" did not necessarily fly. The rest - Paul Carrack, soulless on Young Blood; Elkie Brooks, perfunctorily cruising through Pearl's a Singer as she has done most nights since 1977; Mash's Sally Kellerman, cadaverous on Is That All There Is; Bob Geldof, arrogant but exciting on Riot in Cell Block No 9 - were merely adequate. More than ever resembling a slightly seedy grandfather, Tom Jones climaxed proceedings with Jailhouse Rock - a song, unusually for him, from an era the 61-year-old feels comfortable with. For the ensemble encore - three and a half hours after the lights nearly went down - Jones introduced Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, forcing the uncomfortable-looking pair to sing along to Kansas City, before Jones himself was usurped by the specialised vocal talents of Barry McGuigan and Jimmy Tarbuck. It was that sort of evening. Hammersmith Apollo"}, "isHosted": false}}}
