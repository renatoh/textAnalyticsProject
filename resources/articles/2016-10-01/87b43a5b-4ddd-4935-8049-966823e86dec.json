Looking relaxed and refreshed, not to mention thinner, Bruce made his first public appearance as Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s successor on Thursday. The 55-year-old described returning Villa to the Premier League at the first time of asking \u2013 with the club 19th in the Championship having won one of their first 11 games of the season \u2013 as the \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d of his career but, after achieving a record four promotions from the second tier, he believes he can do that by bringing \u201cspirit and passion\u201d to the club. He also relayed that message to his squad \u2013 he took his first training session at Villa\u2019s Bodymoor Heath before meeting the media there. That includes Agbonlahor, who has not played for Villa since March having been suspended by the club in April after he was pictured smoking a shisha pipe while on holiday in Dubai. The 30-year-old, who came through Villa\u2019s youth ranks and is their leading Premier League goalscorer with 73 goals in 322 games, was then ordered by the then caretaker manager Eric Black to improve his fitness before being told by Di Matteo at the start of this season that he was not part of his plans. The forward has subsequently been training with the under-23s while looking for a new club. But Bruce is adamant that every member of his squad is starting afresh under his charge \u2013 and that includes Agbonlahor. \u201cI\u2019ve said to them [the players] that I\u2019ve got no problem with any of them and that means Gabby, too,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe\u2019s had his problems and he\u2019s got to get himself into some sort of condition but, yes [he is training with the first team].\u201d Bruce resigned as Hull manager in July and has become the sixth man to take charge of Villa in the past 12 months and the second in five years to have also managed city rivals, Birmingham. But while Alex McLeish\u2019s arrival in 2011 was met by fierce supporter protest \u2013 more than 10,000 signed a petition calling on the club\u2019s then owner Randy Lerner not to hire the Scot \u2013 the former Manchester United player has met little resistance from the Villa faithful and he believes that his time at St Andrew\u2019s will benefit his attempt to improve the fortunes of a club who have won four out of their past 54 league games. Two of the four promotions Bruce has achieved were with Birmingham, whom he managed between 2001 and 2007. \u201cOne of the hardest parts of management is trying to bring a club back after it\u2019s been relegated because there is a lot of doom and gloom around, especially among supporters,\u201d said Bruce, who has signed a rolling contract with Villa and appointed Stephen Clemence as first\u2011team coach after working with the former midfielder in the same capacity at Hull. \u201cThe first thing I and the players have to do is win back the supporters\u2019 trust and having lived in the area for 15 years I know they want to see their team play with spirit and passion. That\u2019s what I did with Birmingham and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll try and do here.\u201d Bruce\u2019s first game in charge comes with the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. The new manager is determined to \u201chit the ground running\u201d and believes that if he does, promotion remains possible. Villa are currently 10 points adrift of the play-off positions and have not won since a 3-0 triumph over Rotherham on 13 August. Di Matteo lost his job after the 2-0 defeat at Preston before the international break and the club moved for Bruce because of his excellent promotion record and because, according to the chief executive, Keith Wyness, he has the man-management skills to clear Villa\u2019s \u201crelegation cobwebs\u201d. Bruce has yet to meet Villa\u2019s Chinese owner Tony Xia but has spoken with the 39-year-old on the phone and will meet him when he travels to England next month. \u201cHe [Xia] said to me that he wants Villa back in the Premier League sooner rather than later,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHis plans after that are staggering and he\u2019s got finances to be able to achieve that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
