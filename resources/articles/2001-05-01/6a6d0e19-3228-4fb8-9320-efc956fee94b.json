Roma's 18-year quest for the scudetto should be over by the end of their next game. A win at 16th-placed Napoli in two weeks' time would secure them the Italian title, only the third of their 74-year history. The Lupi stumbled on Sunday, when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Milan, but they are still four points clear at the top with two games left to play. Juventus, who won 1-0 at home to Perugia, are second. Lazio, who drew 1-1 with Internazionale in Bari, fell to third, five points behind their city rivals. \"We simply have to win our two games and aim to finish as high as we can,\" said the Juventus coach Carlo Ancelotti. \"If we win our matches and finish on 73 points and Roma are still above us then Roma will deserve the title - 73 points is a huge amount to beat.\" Since Serie A switched to three points for a win in the 1994-95 season, only Juventus in 1998 have finished with more than 73 points. A bright Sunday afternoon soon turned grey for the Lupi when Hernan Crespo put Lazio ahead against Inter and Milan took the lead against the run of play at the Stadio Olimpico, when Francesco Coco headed in a Serginho cross in first-half injury-time. Roma's coach Fabio Capello threw on Vincenzo Montella at half-time and, as so often this season, the little Italian international striker came to his side's rescue. He hit the post in the 56th minute and struck a glorious equaliser eight minutes later. Picking the ball up on the right flank, he drifted inside, shaped to pass, then darted inside Milan's Federico Giunti and curled a left-foot shot from 30 yards over the towering Sebastiano Rossi into the top corner of the net. Both sides had been reduced to 10 men five minutes earlier. Montella bamboozled Kahka Kaladze, prompting the Georgian midfielder to clatter him from behind. Vincent Candela was so outraged that he lashed out at Kaladze and both players were sent off. Milan were reduced to nine men in the 67th minute when Serginho was dismissed for dissent but almost stole a late winner through another Brazilian, Roque Junior, who hit the Roma woodwork three minutes from the end. There was better to come for Roma. Stephane Dalmat's equalised for Inter in the fourth minute of injury-time, news that was greeted with a roar of relief in the Stadio Olimpico. Lazio had threatened to overwhelm Inter and hit the crossbar twice in the first half-hour before Crespo headed them in front with his 24th goal of the season. But Inter hung on and finally landed their counter punch when Dalmat drove in the equaliser from 30 yards out. Juventus also had a Frenchman to thank. David Trezeguet converted a Gianluca Zambrotta cross in the 55th minute to give them a hard-fought win over Perugia. \"We weren't brilliant tonight,\" Ancelotti admitted, \"but it was a very important win for us. There is still a chance and as long as there is a chance then we will hope.\" And there is still hope for Verona, though they remain second from bottom of Serie A. They overcame an early deficit to gain a 5-4 win over Bologna that leaves them only two points below the relegation plimsoll line. Reggina beat Bari 1-0 with a Jorge Vargas goal to leap above Napoli, who drew 0-0 at Udinese, and put them level on points with Vicenza and Lecce, who both lost. Udinese have 35 points, Vicenza, Lecce and Reggina 33 each, Napoli 32 and Verona 31. Three of those sides will join Bari in Serie B next season. Parma, who won 2-1 at Lecce to remain in fourth place and on course for a Champions League place next season, have admitted that their veteran defender Stefano Torrisi has become the eighth Italian League player this season to test positive for nandrolone. \"I'm destroyed by this news but I'm clean,\" he told the club's website, www.acparma.it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
