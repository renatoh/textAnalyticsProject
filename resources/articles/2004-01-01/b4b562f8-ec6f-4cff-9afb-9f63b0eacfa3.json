The survey of 1,000 workers, aged between 20 and 65, conducted by the Consumer Analysis Group, showed that 68% of those working in education were in their dream job. However, the lecturers' union Natfhe said working conditions in education made its workers a volatile group. Roger Kline, head of the union's universities department, responded to the results by calling for better working conditions for the sector's workers. \"Education may be the 'dream job' of many teachers and lecturers but it becomes a nightmare if it can't pay the mortgage,\" he said. \"As with health professionals, the vocational commitment of educators is often exploited, but with workloads increasing year on year, employers should not imagine this will be tolerated forever.\" A spokesman for the National Union of Teachers conceded that while many teachers do report frustrations with their work, overall it is the ability to make a real difference to the lives of children that gives teachers their sense of satisfaction with their work. \"Research has been done in the past which shows as many as 92% of teachers to be satisfied with their job in terms of actual contact time with the children in the classroom,\" said the spokesman. \"Obviously there are other pressures and frustrations which affect the way that many teachers feel about the profession, but whilst many may say that they would like to leave the profession, the chance to see their work making a real difference to the lives of children means that for many, if they think of the positive aspects of the work, teaching really is their dream job.\" Teaching as a career fared considerably better than most others in the survey. Some 75% of retailers loathe their jobs and 53% of those working in finance are apparently seeking a career change. About 71% of those questioned consider themselves \"career drifters\" and a quarter admit that they see their job as simply a way in which to pay the bills. Nearly all of those questioned (93%) said they would be prepared to spend two years studying for qualifications if they thought it would help them land their dream job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
