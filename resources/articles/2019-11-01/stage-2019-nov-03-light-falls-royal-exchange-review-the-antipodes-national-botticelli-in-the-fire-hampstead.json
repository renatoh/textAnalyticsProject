Her time in the city has been forceful and fruitful: distinctively feminist and strongly cooperative. The acting talent of Maxine Peake has been central to the theatre\u2019s identity, as has the writing of Stockport-born, London-based Simon Stephens. For Stephens\u2019s new play, he and Frankcom travelled to places in the north of England that had echoes in the dramatist\u2019s history but which he had never before visited; they collected biographies and anecdotes and have come up with a suitable valedictory production about a family whose members are scattered but not wholly divided: an elegy to the north. Light Falls begins at the end, with a cogent note on death described not only as the moment when your tense shifts from present to past, but when you move from first to third person. Which is what happens on stage, where Naomi Dawson\u2019s imposing design, bare save for a monumental flight of steps, creates an inside-outside space: a bedroom, a graveyard, sometimes intimate, sometimes public. As Rebecca Manley (fine-voiced and delicate) reaches for a bottle of vodka in a supermarket, she haemorrhages. She tells us she can smell fried eggs and that she is gathering her family around her in her thoughts. Then she moves to the side of the stage; her children and husband take over; she is no longer \u201cI\u201d but \u201cshe\u201d. At the moment of their mother\u2019s death, one daughter wakes up with an unfamiliar chap, another struggles with her new baby, a son settles happily with his boyfriend; the about-to-be widower (Lloyd Hutchinson) goes for a threesome. Slivers of action circle around each other, gradually coming together as variations on family life. In the course of the evening, three characters unleash great roars of pain; Hutchinson\u2019s is particularly unsettling: like the slow creak of a huge, rusty door. Jarvis Cocker\u2019s original music takes up a tiny a part of the evening (the Royal Exchange cheekily bills it so prominently you almost expect a musical). Yet it supplies a wonderful focus when what had been a solo plea becomes a chorus. I wish Cocker didn\u2019t talk of \u201cnorthern blood\u201d \u2013 which smacks of nationalism. But this may be a southerner\u2019s envy speaking: it\u2019s hard to imagine an elegy to the south that would not be riddled with rightwing chauvinism. The American playwright Annie Baker has provided some of the best \u2013 most unnerving, most acute \u2013 evenings in the theatre of the past five years. Both The Flick (set in a movie house after a show) and John (a Gettysburg B&amp;B) rewired theatrical expectation. They questioned what counts as action on stage. Her plays, though often described as slow, are not sluggish \u2013 they super-saturate each moment with interest. They make distinctions between the everyday and the supernatural look trivial. And they make set design seem animate. It\u2019s worth remembering when Rufus Norris\u2019s National is criticised, that both The Flick and John have been seen there under his artistic directorship. The Antipodes, first staged in New York two years ago, glints with Baker\u2019s brilliance. Yet, although it\u2019s the most opaque of her three plays put on at the National, it seems to me the least subtle and probing. The declared subject matter is storytelling. We don\u2019t know to what end the seven blokes and one woman, gathered together around an oval glass table, are encouraged by a dodgily dominant chairman to spill their beans: about early sexual encounters ( does it help to have a bent penis?), about what qualifies as a monster (no trolls allowed), about the tales that infants tell, and about ancestral creation myths. The group may be dreaming up a movie or an ad: that is never made plain. They seem to be part of some corporate venture, with an overseeing boss who occasionally appears on screen and a chair who, in Conleth Hill\u2019s clever performance, bullies his colleagues with rumpled mildness and victimhood. Baker co-directs with designer Chloe Lamford, with some telling choreography by Sasha Milavic Davies \u2013 the cast swivelling together on their caster chairs in group-thinking mode. Arthur Darvill is whippety-good; Fisayo Akinade continues to power up his talent; Imogen Doel is exquisitely funny as a hair-flicking assistant with an enviable assortment of splashy onesies and an old-fashioned cutesy manner. The trouble is that storytelling \u2013 a word that I dread hearing on the radio \u2013 has become everyone\u2019s subject everywhere and all the time. It is now barely a topic: it is the element in which we swim, so all-inclusive, so infinitely expandable, both so obviously about everything other than itself and so obviously self-referencing. I prefer my Baker less theoretical and more peculiar. Paintings, plague, persecution. And pants. Lots of the latter \u2013 mostly off. Jordan Tannahill\u2019s Botticelli in the Fire, first produced in Toronto in 2016, brings the 21st century into Renaissance Florence, with the aim of queering history. So while the artist, \u201ca voracious bottom\u201d, is painting The Birth of Venus and going to bed with his model, he has the hots for Leonardo da Vinci, who puts in extra hours painting Venus\u2019s feet. The two painters (I don\u2019t want to think what this is code for) end up licking peanut butter from two sides of one knife. Savonarola threatens, as does plague; populist censoriousness is on the rise. The parallels between now and then attempt to be rousing but are only approximate. This does not feel like salvaging lost homosexual history but, rather, makes it look like mere Bottycelli. Blanche McIntyre directs with panache. In a golden circle created by Johanna Town\u2019s lighting, Dickie Beau\u2019s frenetic Botticelli is cradled in his mother\u2019s arms as if posing for a Piet\u00e0. With no rackets or balls in sight (unusual, in this production), Christopher Shutt\u2019s sound design makes a game of squash from the noise of the impacts. But it\u2019s hard to see what piety is being usefully dismantled or what piece of history truthfully redeemed.
