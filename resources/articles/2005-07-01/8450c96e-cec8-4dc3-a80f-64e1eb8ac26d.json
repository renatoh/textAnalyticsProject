The chancellor said up to \u00a310m would go to victims. The bulk will go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, but \u00a31m has been earmarked for the Relief Charitable Fund, set up by Ken Livingstone and the Red Cross to help the victims of the July 7 attacks. The Treasury will also provide the Metropolitan police with an additional \u00a310m for counter-terrorism operations. In a statement to MPs, Mr Brown said the government would help other countries to crack down on those who supported terrorism. \"Just as there should be no safe haven for those who perpetrate terrorism, so there should no hiding place for those who finance terrorism.\" Assets for 45 accounts in Britain had already been frozen, he said. The number of suspicious transactions reported to the National Criminal Intelligence Service rose from 30,000 in 2001 to 150,000 last year, he told MPs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
