Ruiz celebrated winning the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight belts by buying five cars \u2013 including two types of Mercedes G-Class, a Rolls Royce and a Lamborghini as well as a truck for his parents \u2013 but says his competitive fire rages brighter than ever. While the Mexican-American expects Joshua to come in much lighter in their second fight in a bid to outmanoeuvre him, he predicts another stoppage. \u201cWe\u2019ve been training on being small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI know he is going to try to box me around, that\u2019s why he has lost some weight. He\u2019ll try to keep me away with the jab but that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been practising for. \u201cI think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up. He\u2019s not good enough to avoid me for the full 12 rounds on the back foot. We\u2019ve been working on this for around three months now and I know, whatever he brings, we will be ready for it.\u201d Ruiz admitted that part of his tactics have involved enraging Joshua by calling him a quitter for spitting out his gumshield in their first fight. \u201cI am pretty sure he was mad at me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is what I felt in my heart, he spat his mouthpiece out and quit. \u201cI respect the man outside the ring. I would always hug him and shake his hand, so it\u2019s all about respect. But I want him to be mad and swinging in the ring, I want him to have that attitude because I will be calm and know exactly what we need to do.\u201d Ruiz, who expects to weigh just over 19st again as he did for the first fight with Joshua, also revealed he had been talking to the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, about a unification fight. \u201cMe and Wilder actually talk on the phone, we are good friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what is in the plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
