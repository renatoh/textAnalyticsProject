Umpires will be given full licence to fall back on television evidence for any decision they choose in an experimental move which the International Cricket Council envisages will vastly reduce the number of umpiring errors in Tests and one-day internationals. The controversial plans will be introduced at the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka in September and, if successful, could be officially adopted throughout the international game in time for next year's World Cup in South Africa. Dave Richardson, the former South African wicketkeeper and now the ICC's cricket operations manager, said: \"We expect nine out of 10 TV decisions to be settled within 10 seconds.\" The ICC's chief executive Mal Speed mentioned 20 seconds and added: \"If it slows the game down too much then we won't proceed.\" When a third umpire is contacted, he will be allowed two replays before passing information back to the on-field officials via radio headsets. The third umpire will not be able to intervene of his own accord. Troublesome decisions that should be eased by the availability of video playbacks include lbw appeals where the ball may have pitched outside leg-stump, catches at the wicket which pass between bat and pad, hook shots which fly to the wicketkeeper off either glove or body, and suspected bump-balls. Those who became obsessed last summer by the number of wickets taken by no-balls will also expect tighter checks on overstepping. Richardson suggested that umpires were getting \"93%\" of decisions correct and spoke of a goal to raise that to \"99%\". Justification for the use of replays was that, for difficult decisions, studies showed umpires to be accurate only 60% of the time, which is not much better than a toss of a coin. The England and Wales Cricket Board was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the experiment and, given a successful trial, will support its full-time adoption at an ICC executive board meeting at Lord's in July. John Carr, the ECB's director of cricket operations, said: \"We have always been open to advancements in technology and use of the third umpire. Anything that increases viewer enjoyment, understanding and accuracy is good for the game. Umpires remain central to the game and, in the main, use of television replays has shown how accurate they are.\" On-field umpires will be in constant contact with the TV umpire. To ensure that the TV umpires remain subservient, the ICC will allow them to intervene only when requested. The advent of the elite umpiring panel assuaged cricket committee fears that umpires' status would collapse under the new regime. Sunil Gavaskar, chairman of the cricket committee, said: \"There is a danger that some umpires will want to check every little decision but now we have an elite panel in place we expect them to have the self-confidence to officiate.\" The former Test umpire Dickie Bird disagreed. \"The man in the middle who made all the decisions is finished,\" he said. \"The man on the camera is more important now. It is taking all the authority away from the man in the middle.\" But David Shepherd, England's only representative on the elite umpires panel, said: \"I've always felt that, as technology improves, more decisions should go to the third umpire. We are only human and it's our job to get things right. The game wasn't invented for umpires.\" The first opportunity for umpires to voice reservations will come at an ICC workshop for umpires and match referees which starts here on Thursday. Although the on-field umpires will be from a neutral country when the eight-strong elite panel comes into being on April 1, the TV umpire will remain a home official, drawn from the second-tier panel of 20. Rugby is one sport where home TV umpires have been accused of bias but cricket, for financial reasons and because many umpires do not relish a perpetual life on the road, has no wish to expand the use of neutral officials.
