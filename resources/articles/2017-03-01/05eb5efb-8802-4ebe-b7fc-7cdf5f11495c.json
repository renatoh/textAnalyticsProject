In fact, he was born on 8 July 1938. Also, Marc (not Mark) Aldridge was the artist\u2019s son from his marriage to Rita Farthing, not from another relationship as we had it. And we omitted mention of Aldridge\u2019s son James, from his marriage to Laura Lyons. \u2022 An image of a Howard Hodgkin painting used to illustrate an article about the artist was not Orange Sunset as the caption said. It was of the Hodgkin work Storm in Goa (Serota leads tributes to Howard Hodgkin, the master of colour, after death aged 84, 10 March, page 3). \u2022 A comment piece about Sgt Alexander Blackman, whose conviction for the murder of a Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan was downgraded to manslaughter, said the marine\u2019s commander at the time, Col Oliver Lee, resigned from the army in protest over its handling of the case. He resigned from the navy (Blackman\u2019s case shows the stiff upper lip view of our soldiers is a delusion, 17 March, page 39). \u2022 The first correction above was amended on 20 March 2017. An earlier version gave the year of Alan Aldridge\u2019s birth incorrectly as 1948."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
