That much I understand. I have actually seen Kim Kardashian\u2019s bum. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in that. It was quite interesting to look at. All bums are quite interesting to look at, because, in the general run of things, people keep them hidden. It\u2019s like seeing someone\u2019s bank statement. (Especially mine, which is all papery and red.) Beyond that, I\u2019m baffled. I don\u2019t understand. What? How? I don\u2019t quite comprehend what Kim Kardashian is, where she came from or why we talk about her. That\u2019s not because I\u2019m particularly highbrow; The X Factor and Downton Abbey are squarely on my radar, and most of my iPod is taken up with Dolly Parton. I\u2019ve just missed something with Kim Kardashian. What is the genesis of this famous bum? I feel like I\u2019ve tuned in late, missed a central plank of the story and now can\u2019t follow the plot at all. (I feel much the same way about Syria.) It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t picked up bits along the way. I know she was (is?) in a reality show. I know she once did a sex tape. I know she\u2019s married to a rapper. Still, it doesn\u2019t gel: the level of fame, the 45 million Twitter followers, the mainstream British newspaper coverage. I feel like I\u2019m staring at a cup of flour, a cup of cocoa powder and a cup of sugar, and not understanding how it became a cake. Where is the egg? What bound this together? I\u2019ve seen the butt, but I can\u2019t see the butter. Truth is, I haven\u2019t felt any particular need to investigate Kim Kardashian further. There was no shame, for me, in my ignorance. (In that way, if in no other, she differs from Syria.) I assumed it would be slightly ridiculous for someone like me \u2013 fashion-averse, middle-class and in all statistical likelihood middle-aged \u2013 to know much about Kim Kardashian anyway. I\u2019m not meant to be interested. I\u2019d look silly. You might just as well say that Harriet Harman is interested in the Kardashians. That was my position \u2013 until last Tuesday morning. Last Tuesday morning is when Harriet Harman announced on Good Morning Britain: \u201cI am an expert on the Kardashians.\u201d Had I been holding a cartoon cup of coffee, I would have choked on it. \u201cI think, if you step back,\u201d continued Harman, \u201cthe overall message that comes out of the Kardashian women is that they are kind of going to make their own decisions, make their own way in the world\u2026 There\u2019s a kind of bravery and a pioneering \u2013 oh my God, what am I saying here? \u2013 a pioneering spirit to them.\u201d Oh my God, Harriet, what are you saying here? It\u2019s practically the punchline to a joke. \u201cThat\u2019s like Harriet Harman being a fan of Kim Kardashian!\u201d Here is an alternative point of view. Kim Kardashian leads a new cultural movement that tells young women their aspirations should be about money, jewels, furs and cars, and showing their arse to people is a good route to get there. Right in the skeletal teeth of our historical sisters who were forced to sell their bodies from powerlessness, she demonstrates that even a powerful woman has not much else to sell. This she has in common with Rihanna and Nicki Minaj and all those singers who strip off and boast about how their booty brings booty. But Kim Kardashian is worse because, the daughter of a millionaire lawyer, she was born lucky, and \u2013 having been able to choose anything \u2013 she chose nudity, vanity, posing and a visible obsession with the trappings of wealth. Thus she dupes a generation of poorer, unluckier girls who do not have rich, entitled backgrounds and, having shown off their arses, will find that this does not lead to a nourishing career after all. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what I think. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what I think. But God knows I need that to be what Harriet Harman thinks. Harriet Harman, scourge of Page 3, loves the Kardashian message? Christ alive! That\u2019s like hearing Arthur Scargill say \u201cActually, you know what, on reflection: screw the miners. Live in the now!\u201d Quizzed on her apparently conflicting views, Harman said she preferred the Kardashian roadshow to Page 3 because \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of control, actually\u2026 I get the sense of the Kardashians that they are in control of their own agenda.\u201d But Linda Lusardi and Sam Fox and Maria Whittaker and all the other Page 3 Stunnas would have said, at the time, that they were in control of theirs. And they probably were. It isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about getting your bum out. And I\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t; I don\u2019t know if they shouldn\u2019t. But God knows I need Harriet Harman to think they shouldn\u2019t. She was the balance. A handful of readers might remember that, back in the day, I directed a porn film and wrote a book about it. They might feel queasy at the whiff of high horse. But, as I said in that book, I see a healthy place for the old-fashioned \u201chardcore and adults-only\u201d. It\u2019s the new \u201csoft-core and everywhere\u201d which might diminish us all. Or might not! I don\u2019t know for certain that young women\u2019s role models shouldn\u2019t dance around with their bums out. I just know that I need Harriet Harman to know that they shouldn\u2019t. Whither consistency? Why change tack now? If Harman wants to come across as light-hearted, easy-going, fun-loving and lowbrow, I\u2019m afraid that ship\u2019s long sailed. What she did have was a clear character and a logical moral line: rare traits in modern politics. Which adviser told her that, of all the attributes the public associate with Harriet Harman, the one she really needed to slough off was her credibility?
