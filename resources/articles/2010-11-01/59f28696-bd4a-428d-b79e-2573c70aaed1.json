The businessman Craig Whyte is in talks with Sir David Murray regarding the purchase of the latter's majority stake in the Ibrox club. Smith was reluctant to discuss the matter. \"I don't think there is much more to be said from what has already been speculated upon,\" the manager said today. \"I can't comment because I don't know much about it at all. \"We've had this on two or three occasions before and we will just have to wait and see what happens. We have a hard week of football for us to concentrate on and anything that is happening off the park will not help us one way or another at the present moment.\" Smith did express hope that buy-out talks are concluded swiftly, one way or another, but denied his players would be distracted by off-field events. \"I think everyone would want, if there is any talk of takeovers, that it either happens or doesn't happen as quickly as possible,\" the manager said. \"That is where we are at the present moment. \"We've had to handle a lot of things over the last two and a half years so we are getting used to that kind of aspect of it. It's not something that has an effect on us. I think everyone is getting immune to it.\" Smith disputed the suggestion his players could be thinking ahead to Wednesday's Champions League tie against Manchester United at Ibrox when they travel to Kilmarnock on SPL business tomorrow. \"I don't think we'll be too badly affected by that aspect of it,\" Smith said. \"It would only be natural for them to maybe look forward to that game but we've had that before and I don't see that being a problem for us. We've had a few days off this week because of the international games so we should be back showing a reasonable freshness about us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
