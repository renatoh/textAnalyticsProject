I have travelled to India before \u2013 and unfortunately was robbed on my first day (during a street food tour in Old Delhi) after I gave my wallet to a friend to put in his backpack for safekeeping. While sampling samosas, his backpack was slashed with a knife and my wallet taken. This visit will be different. I am determined not to be robbed again! On Monday, applying for a tourist visa, I become bored with the amount of questions on the form. Mother\u2019s maiden name? Her date of birth? My bank account details? Four photos of me? A scan of my passport? My last trip to India? Where did I go? (\u201cDelhi,\u201d I answer somewhat sourly). The fee for the visa is almost $300. That\u2019s weird, I think. It should be US$80. I don\u2019t think much more of it, until Wednesday morning in London, when I can\u2019t access my online banking. Calling my bank in Australia, I am put through to the fraud team. \u201cWe think your account was accessed without authorisation,\u201d they tell me. Using my details from the fake Indian visa website, someone has made a copy of my bank card and attached it to their phone. The previous night they have gone on a spending spree around Melbourne. They have hit up Puma, a Caltex and a 7-Eleven. Could it have been me, they ask? \u201cLast night I was in Chelsea having dinner with Bob Geldof,\u201d I reply indignantly. \u201cSir Bob Geldof. I mean he was at the next table, he wasn\u2019t actually with me, but yeah, he was NEAR me \u2026 I was having dinner near Bob Geldof on the other side of the world, not at Caltex.\u201d To stop the fraud, the bank tell me they have to block my card, which puts me in a tough position. I\u2019m overseas and about to go travelling. Another card won\u2019t reach me in time \u2013 yet I only have \u00a315 in my wallet. The fraud person at my bank agrees to unblock my card briefly so I can get some cash out, \u201cbut only for 30 minutes. By 7pm Australia time we\u2019ll put the block back on it permanently.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re lifting the block now?\u201d \u201cYes, now, for 30 minutes.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m still in my pyjamas!\u201d I chuck on some clothes and run down to Tottenham Court Road like a contestant on Supermarket Sweep. It\u2019s horrible. I race into a coffee shop. \u201cFLAT WHITE TO GO. I come back.\u201d Finding the nearest cash machine, I take out the maximum amount of money but it\u2019s still nowhere near enough for two weeks\u2019 travelling. Shove cash wad in wallet but it doesn\u2019t fit and bulges out precariously. Race across the road, narrowly miss getting hit by doubledecker bus. I need shoes and sunglasses. Must buy before card expires. Run to Primark. Shop too large and confusing. People walk slowly, staring at their phones. Thought this was supposed to be fast fashion. Pick up random ugly shoes and sunglasses and do not try them on. No time! Back out on street. Remember coffee ordered. Run back, get it. Coffee cold. Order another while I still have my card. Run out on to road with a coffee in each hand. I need to get presents for my London hosts. Run to a flower stand. \u201cYou take card?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cGive me some of those and some of those! I pay now!!!\u201d Drink both coffees (one too hot, the other one cold) while flowers wrapped and start shaking with caffeine and stress. Ten minutes left! Run to book store, yank a greeting card off the shelf for hosts. It could say anything. I have no time to check. Six minutes left. Too many bags now, and my cash falling from wallet. Knock over a stack of books with my oversized stems of flowers. Why did he give me giant flowers? Looking for presents for hosts. Books. Too many! Coffee jitters! Grab something with a yellow cover by author I have never heard of, blurbed by other authors l have never heard of. This will have to do! I will read it on the plane. Person on till has sleepy voice. Says: \u201cThe till\u2019s just waking up, it\u2019s a bit slow today.\u201d I scream but hold it in. He asks me how my day is going \u201cso far\u201d. \u201cSo far, so bad!\u201d Buy book and card, leave store, remember I need to get presents for hosts. Have only bought present for self and giant flowers. Two minutes. I grab two random books from shelf. Something about the financial crisis? Something about female friendship? Race to till that\u2019s still waking up. German woman gets in before me. No!!! I have 90 seconds. She\u2019s not even buying anything. She wants \u2026 she wants \u2026 WTF does she want? A book? Yes! On \u201cwalking\u201d! FFS, narrow it down!! I\u2019m almost standing on top of her, dribbling with stress. I have a minute to buy my hosts these random presents before my money is cut off!!! She\u2019s trying to explain the book. But she\u2019s doing it wrong! Instead of naming the author, she\u2019s slowly describing to the clerk the book\u2019s dimensions. She draws a book in the air with her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s this size.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the size of a book!\u201d I yell out. The clerk sends her to the back of the shop. I throw down my books. \u201cScan now or it may not work.\u201d It\u2019s almost 7pm in Australia. I wave my card over the machine. \u201cArrgh, work! Please!\u201d We wait as the hour ticks over. \u201cApproved.\u201d \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
