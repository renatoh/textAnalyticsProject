Ever since they were taken from the Acropolis in 1801, the British have argued that they have the legal right to keep the beautiful stone friezes that once decorated the sides of the Parthenon building. But this weekend, ahead of a new campaign for the return of the Marbles by 2004, a leading museum director has thrown the issue wide open by telling the British Museum that it should share them. 'There must be a possibility that something could now work for all parties,' said Mark Jones, director of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London. 'I cannot tell another museum how to behave on this, but I do believe it is possible to develop partnerships. It can be good to display objects at different places.' His approach to the problem is a radical departure for a museum director, given the historic intransigence of both the British Government and the British Museum. The 176-yard frieze was sculpted in the fifth century BC and removed from the Parthenon by Lord Elgin, the British Ambassador to Greece. The country has called for its return since 1829, when it won independence from Turkey, but Britain insists the sculptures were acquired legally and should remain at the British Museum, where they are securely stored and maintained. Last March, Tony Blair told a Greek newspaper: 'The Marbles belong to the British Museum which, as I have been informed, does not intend to return any part of its collection to the country of origin.' Jones, who took up his post at the V&amp;A last year, believes this is unimaginative thinking. 'Wherever there is a strongly held belief, there is an opportunity there too, if it can be recognised,' he said. 'It is not necessarily a case of transferred ownership or of giving the Marbles back for good, but when people believe things are really important, as the Greeks and the British Museum do in this case, that is actually a good thing. Apathy is our great enemy.' The campaign, Parthenon 2004, will be launched on Wednesday in the Houses of Parliament by Liberal Democrat MP Richard Allan. Political figures including Michael Foot and Tony Banks are expected to attend, along with celebrities such as actresses Vanessa Redgrave, Frances de la Tour, Fiona Shaw and Janet Suzman, and the television presenter and producer William G. Stewart. 'This issue should be in the political domain,' Allan told The Observer. 'It is not a Greek thing or a nationalist thing. We should not be looking backwards at whether Lord Elgin was a saint or a sinner. We should be able to draw a line under everything else that has happened.' The idea for the campaign sprang from conversations between Allan, who has a background in archaeology, and David Hill, executive director of the British Committee for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles. They hope the Athens Olympics in 2004 will provide fresh impetus for returning the Marbles. 'The British Museum has told me it doesn't have confidence the Greeks can do all they have promised in terms of looking after the Marbles, but the museum could make a handover in time for the Olympics conditional on a new museum in Athens being built,' said Allan. 'The museum argues that the Marbles are an academic facility,' he added, 'but that is only for the benefit of a small group, while I believe a lot of British people would say they would like to see the Marbles back in Greece. Legally, it could be termed a loan rather than a gift.' Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek Minister of Culture, said last year he had no interest in disputing legal ownership. 'I accept the possibility of a long-term loan because, for me, the most important problem is the restitution of the Marbles.' A British Museum spokesman said the director, Robert Anderson, was aware of the campaign but the museum's position had not changed. A Mori poll taken in 1998 and a BBC internet poll in 1999 both disclosed overwhelming support for the return of the Marbles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
