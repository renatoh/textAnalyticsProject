The 7-1 dismissal of the hosts in Belo Horizonte, the Sele\u00e7ao\u2019s heaviest ever defeat, has established Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side as favourites to claim their fourth World Cup at the Maracan\u00e3 on Sundaywith their players\u2019 confidence soaring. They boast the most threatening and fluid midfield in the tournament, the World Cup\u2019s all-time record goalscorer in Miroslav Klose, and huge incentive as they attempt to claim the trophy for the first time since 1990. That victory 24 years ago in Rome\u2019s Stadio Olimpico came at the expense of Diego Maradona\u2019s Argentina, with the 53-year-old quoted this week suggesting Tuesday\u2019s semi-final thrashing had gone to Germany\u2019s heads. \u201cThey are, as we say, full of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is better for Argentina. Beating this German team is not impossible.\u201d While that assessment has been rejected by senior members of L\u00f6w\u2019s squad, there is a realisation that Alejandro Sabella\u2019s team will pose a very different threat to that presented by Brazil, with the chances of a repeat walkover \u2013 even to match their 4-0 quarter-final defeat of this opposition in South Africa four years ago \u2013 considered unlikely. \u201cOf course it is dangerous,\u201d said Mertesacker when asked if the ease of the team\u2019s victory against Brazil might lull them into a false sense of security. \u201cWe want to finish on a high, and that means performance-wise. Our performance against Brazil was nearly 100%. If you look at the stats, the passing, the goals we scored \u2026 everything was so fluent. Everyone coped with the pressure situation well. \u201cYou could see the difference between the teams and that\u2019s why we created history. But that\u2019s not all. We want more. We want more history. We don\u2019t want to just settle for this result before the final. \u201cAfter that game, it\u2019s going to be hard not to be considered favourites for the final, but we must stay focused. We can\u2019t lose our focus now because we scored seven goals. We must keep calm and be aware of the situation. There\u2019s one game missing and we must stay focused and play the same way that we did against Brazil. We want to achieve something special with this team. We played a good match with Brazil but we have to show another game with the same attitude, with the same focus,\u201d added the Arsenal defender, who started on the bench against Brazil on Tuesday before replacing Mats Hummels for the second half with Germany leading 5-0 at the break. \u201cThat\u2019s needed in the final, otherwise we have no chance. If we drop even five per cent then we have no chance. Everyone had to calm down after midweek. It\u2019s hard after such a result, but everyone needed to calm down and regroup after the semi-final and try to finish well, and that\u2019s our main target for the final.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
