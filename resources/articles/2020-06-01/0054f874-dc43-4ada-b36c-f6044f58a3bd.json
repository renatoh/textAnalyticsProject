Ansell has just been appointed the artistic director of Sydney festival, taking the baton from Wesley Enoch, who bows out after 2021. She comes to the role after three and a half years as the head of contemporary performance at the Sydney Opera House, where she was responsible for programming works such as Grand Finale, by UK-based dance company Hofesh Shechter, and Lucy Moss and Toby Marlow\u2019s wildly popular Henry VIII musical, Six. January\u2019s festival \u2013 and the program most immediately affected by the pandemic, including physical distancing regulations and restrictions on gatherings \u2013 is primarily the incumbent\u2019s responsibility, and Ansell\u2019s first line-up will be in 2022. But how do you plan for an international arts festival when you\u2019re dealing with indefinite border closures, an unstable economy, and you don\u2019t know which companies will still be operating at the end of the year, let alone in 18 months\u2019 time? \u201cHonestly, the key is to have plan A, B, C, D, E and F,\u201d Ansell says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to remain ready to \u2013 I hate this word \u2013 pivot.\u201d Despite her professed distaste for the jargon of adaptation, Ansell lauds the \u201cextreme agility\u201d demonstrated by the arts organisations thrown into chaos over the past three months. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen organisations with no digital program suddenly have a robust digital culture,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we would have [in the past] entertained the idea of a creative team researching and developing a work where some of the creatives were in a different country and watching the actors or singers create in the room from a different timezone, but that\u2019s been happening.\u201d She name-checks Melbourne\u2019s AsiaTopa festival and the quick adjustments made there earlier this year: \u201cWhen the news was announced that the borders for China were closing, some of the creatives remained in China, developing the work that was presented in Melbourne remotely, giving guidance and direction online.\u201d Regardless of their scope, the major festivals do tend to roll in a few major international touring acts to headline the program. That won\u2019t be happening in Sydney next year: with borders still closed, Enoch\u2019s last festival will be an all-Australian line-up, joining Melbourne\u2019s new festival Rising (a replacement for both its annual International Arts festival and White Night), Darwin festival and Falls festival in wholly embracing local talent. Ansell has \u201cbig shoes to fill\u201d in that respect anyway, not simply to strengthen the relationship with greater Sydney \u2013 \u201cThis has always been a festival for all parts of Sydney, not just the city of Sydney area\u201d \u2013 but with maintaining a strong program of Indigenous art and performance. \u201cWesley\u2019s legacy undoubtedly has been his incredible commitment to the commissioning of exciting new First Nations theatre,\u201d Ansell says. It\u2019s a commitment she plans to continue \u2013 including retaining the Vigil, a reflection on Australia\u2019s colonial institutions and Indigenous history on 25 January. With a Covid-19 vaccine still some way off, and social distancing rules being eased ever so gradually, Ansell is confident the festival can negotiate new anxieties about physical proximity. \u201cAs a festival we\u2019re always thinking of atypical spaces and ways to see Sydney\u2019s architecture differently anyway,\u201d she says. It does provide an excuse to delve into another her passions, though: Ansell was the executive producer of Vivid\u2019s immersive performance series Hidden Sydney a couple of years ago. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a Sydney history tragic, I love the charisma that Sydney exudes. Some people say it\u2019s a hedonistic city but I think it\u2019s a city with a deep underbelly of stories,\u201d she says. The first challenge though is to get to the end of the year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try and keep everybody propped up and supported,\u201d she says, noting recent announcements by state governments of emergency relief for the arts. \u201cThere\u2019s been some lifelines \u2026 [but] I wish there was more funding, I really do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
