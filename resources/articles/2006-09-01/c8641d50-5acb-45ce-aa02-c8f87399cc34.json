One side-effect of my illness was an almost complete loss of taste, combined with an obsession with food on TV. So I became addicted to Ready Steady Cook, the BBC daytime programme. The sight of 'ordinary people' struggling to transform a \u00a35 bag of ingredients into coq au vin, say, or steak au poivre became a strange provocation to my inert tastebuds, but that wasn't the reason for this bizarre voyeurism. I was hooked particularly on Ainsley Harriott and the programme's sign-off catchphrase, 'Will it be green peppers or red tomatoes?' (the climax is the studio audience voting for competing teams with red and green cards). To a patient in the depths of hospital-inspired depression, Harriott's deranged enthusiasm and zesty presence was an addictive pick-me-up. I have the culinary savoir faire of a goat, but it was perfectly obvious that this smiling giant of a man in his ludicrous clothes was - shall we say? - one part cook to nine parts personality. Here was someone oven-ready to become a celebrity chef. For Ainsley, the glass is always half full and his irrepressible (read: infuriating) optimism transforms 30 minutes of humdrum programme into something almost uplifting, in which every cloud has a silver lining and nothing is too charred to be devoured with relish. Long after I had been discharged and was deep into convalescence, I remained a devotee, in common (I later discovered) with thousands of students and housewives. Ready Steady Cook is about to return to our screens. If Ainsley's still there, I'll be watching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
