Now they are straining the wells of goodwill in the game. After Barnsley beat them 2-0 at Oakwell the home manager, Keith Hill, was asked whether he had any sympathy for Pompey. \"Absolutely none,\" he said, \"because they've recruited players I couldn't afford and are paying wages I could only dream about paying. They are spending money they haven't got, so why should I have sympathy? For Michael Appleton, yes, the players and supporters, yes. But for what the club are doing, no.\" Appleton had no idea what lay ahead when he took his first managerial job in October. In November the owner for six months, the Russian businessman Vladimir Antonov, resigned as his company, Convers Sports Initiatives, went into administration. Portsmouth followed suit on Friday, for the second time in two years. In 2010 the nine points docked effectively guaranteed their exit from the Premier League, where they had spent seven seasons and more money than they had. The 10 deducted last week sent them from 18th to 21st in the Championship. Nottingham Forest's Saturday win made that 22nd. Pompey have not been in the third tier since 1983. They have 15 games in which to preserve their status and a lot of work to do to restore a proud name. They are not alone in taking advantage of the special relationship football has forged with finance. Pompey seem happy to drop into administration as others do into a rehab centre, then return there a few owners later. The \"football creditors rule\" means that, in cases of insolvency, debts to players and other clubs are prioritised; HMRC can wait, though they did win an appeal against the same administrators being re-engaged. Trevor Birch, former chief executive of Chelsea and Leeds, will front the administration for the firm PKF. \"I'm used to dealing with clubs in crisis; 30% of the clubs in the Championship are paying wages in excess of 100% of turnover,\" he said. \"The intention is to sell the club as a going concern. Hitherto someone has always come out of the woodwork to buy football clubs.\" Craig Davies hit Pompey's bar early on but no one came to the rescue. Though they have the smallest squad in the division, at 19, many are on Premier League wages with Premier League experience, notably in defence, and they held on until the last 15 minutes. Until funds were released through administration they claimed not to have the wherewithal to travel or the minimum 14 players to fulfil the fixture. Having hunted for a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Championship, they went by coach rather than air and left the bench two-fifths empty. Stools would have done. And this was a club that won the Cup in 2008 \u2013 in hindsight maybe under false pretences. Last week they could not afford to scan Liam Lawrence's injured calf. On Friday they re-loaned George Thorne, who had returned to West Brom. Three players started with injuries; one substitute was a goalkeeper. Dave Kitson's dismissal for a second yellow card before half-time did not help. Appleton could fairly have given them a \"heads down\" but, until they ran out of markers to let Jim O'Brien break the deadlock, they held out with a poise that did not flatter Barnsley. Matt Done's breakaway second came with all defenders up for a free-kick. David Lampitt, who has run Pompey between administrations as chief executive, paid tribute to \"everyone who had kept the club going despite not being paid since Christmas\". He previously ran the Football Association's compliance unit. Pompey had 618 fans at Oakwell and most have had enough of him. \"All we want is the right owner to secure long-term sustainability,\" said one, Tony Goodall. Appleton, a model of wry philosophy, said he could not fine Kitson as he had not been paid. \"I try to control what I can control,\" he said. \"Hopefully the Football League show sense and let us get players in or other clubs could start complaining. All we want is a level playing field.\" That was Hill's point: level for Pompey may not be level for others. And that presumably would be the Football League that saw Antonov as fit and proper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
