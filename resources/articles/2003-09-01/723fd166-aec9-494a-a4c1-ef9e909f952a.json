However, we are concerned that the government may not provide sufficient resources to put these proposals into operation. The plans to improve accountability for child welfare are a positive step. Local children's directors will be able to take a strategic approach to service delivery, while appointed councillors will be the public champions of children's welfare. Children's trusts, bringing together local authority education and social services, will lead to a more holistic approach to childcare and ensure that vulnerable children are better protected. The increased involvement of education in child protection should contribute to the fast and effective identification of children at risk. Making child welfare a higher priority for schools will also help tackle problems such as bullying. Combining health, education and social services for children was a key element of Lord Laming's report, and the local children's safeguarding boards and the requirement on agencies to share information about children will go some way to preventing the lack of coordination evident in the Victoria Climbi\u00e9 tragedy. However, as a UK-wide organisation, ChildLine hopes that the new structures will not replace professional boundaries with geographical ones. It is often the case that the most vulnerable children are those who move around the country and slip through the net. Although it is important that the children's trusts are not uniform, so they can respond to local needs, it is also imperative that young people are not victims of a 'postcode lottery' in service provision. Our greatest concern is whether the government will provide the funding necessary to bring about this organisational reform, and the training and staffing requirements every local authority will need. The new career pathways for childcare professionals and work-based training are important proposals, but professions such as social work will only be accorded high status and attract good quality staff if they are properly resourced. The plans to examine current foster care regulations, including encouraging more people to become informal foster carers and foster parents, is a positive step. The enhanced training opportunities and financial rewards proposed acknowledge the vital contribution of fostering in the lives of vulnerable children. But the government must be careful not to swamp potential carers with red tape, which may discourage those who currently foster in an informal capacity, such as grandparents or family friends. The appointment of an independent children's commissioner comes after years of campaigning for such a post by ChildLine and others. Although it is encouraging that the commissioner will be accountable to parliament, we would also want him or her to be equally accountable to children. In this way the post will have a respected, powerful and authoritative voice - and, crucially, one trusted by children and young people. However, we need to know more about the powers, resources and accountability of the commissioner. The post will need far greater resources than those already in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland given that there are 11 million children in England. The priority now is that this legislation be brought forward at the earliest opportunity so that it can start making a real difference to children's lives. \u00b7 Carole Easton is the chief executive of the children's charity ChildLine"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
