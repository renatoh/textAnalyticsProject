I think it was a book tour. I was the only photographer there. He was sitting with his back to the window. I wasn't allowed to use flash so I shot it on super-grainy film, on a 200mm lens. That's why it has an out-of-world feel to it, as if it was taken with one of those plate cameras where they clamped people's heads to keep them still. The way it turned out was wonderfully appropriate, as Powell in some ways was a man born out of time. He certainly didn't fit in the mid-90s, on the brink of the New Labour victory. He spoke about the Roman era as if it had happened yesterday. He had a very strange speaking voice, nasal and high-pitched. It should have been grating, but in fact it was hypnotic. Later on, when I started working as a professional photographer, I put this in my portfolio, and the reactions to it were always fascinating. Some people turned it over quickly, some people asked about it; and one designer raised it over his head and started chanting: \"Enoch! Wa-hey!\" I always wanted to be a photographer. While I was at school I got a lab-monkey holiday job in the darkrooms at the Independent. What they taught me there was: you need to get the whole story in one frame. I hope this one does that. It's one of the few pictures that I think, \"Wow, this is what I wanted to do.\" For me, photography only stopped because I was selling books. In fact, Schott's Miscellanies only came about because, as a freelancer, I used to send out Christmas cards to picture editors \u2013 the Guardian among them \u2013 and one year I added a booklet of information. But things have changed so much. Even as recently as 2003, I was shooting medium-format transparencies. Now everything's gone electronic. All my black-and-white lab skills are dead.
