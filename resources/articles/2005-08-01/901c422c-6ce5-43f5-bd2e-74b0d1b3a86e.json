We met realising we both had a gift for setting up the boys in our class for crimes they didn't commit, such as planting stolen text books in their lockers. We also planted rotten bread dough behind the blackboard. We share this reverse, bizarre sense of humour. To an outsider we may appear silly or, in fact, deranged. At one time we seemed to have this eerie psychic connection, each knowing what the other was thinking. We have swapped the same Christmas cards, bought the same clothes and often phone each other at the same time. We both have a sense of mischief. She's a doctor, I'm not. So in our early twenties our worlds were further apart. I love history, but Helen, until recently, didn't know when World War II ended. Also, I am perhaps more tenacious while Helen is more emotional. I am very organised and like everything neat, tidy and hygienic. Lynne is generally less bothered and will quite happily dribble yogurt down her chin to annoy me and not wipe it off. She can also miss brushing her teeth, which would give me a sleepless night. She is currently promoting a tooth-whitening product. On one of our nights out, we decided to take home the house-shaped ornamental carved turnip from our meal at a Thai restaurant. After it had festered in Helen's handbag for a few hours we superglued it to the door of Helen's local arts centre. In the morning the turnip was still stuck on the door handle, so Helen's husband had to go and remove it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
