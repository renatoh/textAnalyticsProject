After seeing the white-haired Bobby Robson make his first entrance back at Portman Road in charge of an opposing team, Ipswich played as if they had seen a ghost. While a narrow win over Newcastle United, secured through Marcus Stewart's penalty 14 minutes from the end, has restored George Burley's side to third in the Premiership, Ipswich will need to perform more convincingly on Teesside today if they are to put points between themselves and their rivals for the last Champions League place. When Robson's outstanding Ipswich side finished runners-up to Aston Villa in the First Division in 1981 the general feeling was that they should have won it. Losing seven of their last 10 matches did not help. By contrast, should Burley's team manage to come third, the achievement, so soon after winning promotion, will be greeted with considerable acclaim and rightly so. As Ipswich's mentor said after Saturday's match: \"They may not have outstanding players like David Beckham or Ryan Giggs but every member of this side plays to his potential and beyond.\" Even as he said this, Robson must have wished he could praise his own side in similar terms. In fact until late January Newcastle were winning with sufficient regularity to harbour their own ambitions of European football next season. Saturday's defeat, however, steepened a decline which has now seen them take two points from seven fixtures. Injuries to Kieron Dyer, Nikos Dabizas and Alan Shearer, who is almost certain to need another operation on his knee that will keep him out until next season, have weakened the spine of Robson's team but a serious reappraisal is surely needed for next season. Newcastle could take a hint from Ipswich and scour the sort of boot sales which have seen Jim Magilton and the Dutch pair, Fabian Wilnis and Martijn Reuser, flourish at Portman Road. Where St James' Park might struggle is in reproducing the friendly yet business-like background against which Burley's team continues to thrive. Not that Ipswich did much thriving on Saturday. Against determined but hardly daunting opposition their passing was tentative and their overall game uncharacteristically flabby. Eventually Hermann Hreidarsson was given the chance to push up on the left flank but the Icelander still failed to shake off a general ennui which might have been punished had Carl Cort's bouncing header past Richard Wright on the half-hour not been disallowed for a push. To be sure, a hard-hit, wickedly-swerving centre from Reuser did produce a diving header against the bar after 17 minutes but the marksman was a Newcastle defender, Aaron Hughes, who with Andy O'Brien suffered few other moments of anxiety before the moment when the match was won and lost. This occurred in the 76th minute when Newcastle lost concentration as Mark Venus took a corner, allowing Hreidarsson the header which Nolberto Solano kept out with an arm. Off went Solano and in went Marcus Stewart's 21st goal of the season to end an uncomfortable afternoon. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
