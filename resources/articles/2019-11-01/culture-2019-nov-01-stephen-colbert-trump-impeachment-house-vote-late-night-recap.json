The resolution passed 232-196, led by Colbert\u2019s guest of the evening, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. No Republicans supported the measure, leaving Colbert to wonder: \u201cAre they just complaining about process with those zero votes? Or are they really so lacking any honor that they are willing to publicly state that blackmailing a foreign government to interfere in our election is OK?\u201d Earlier Thursday, a reporter asked House Republicans, led by the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, if they were willing to go on the record that the president did nothing inappropriate. \u201cVery clear, yes,\u201d McCarthy answered. Colbert had a follow-up question: \u201cThe Titanic just hit an iceberg; the captain is saying, \u2018It was a perfect iceberg, now we can make all the Slurpees for everyone,\u2019 and he\u2019s asking you all to handcuff yourself to the port side rail and swallow the keys. Are you all willing to do that?\u201d \u201cVery clear, yes,\u201d McCarthy says in the replayed clip. \u201cGood to know,\u201d Colbert nodded. The Republican congressmen who vehemently opposed the impeachment process vote \u201chave a small problem\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cIt is \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 evidence. We keep getting more and more of it.\u201d On Thursday, it was revealed that immediately after Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a witness to the call, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, reported his concerns to a White House lawyer. That lawyer then moved the record of the call to an unusual, top-secret server. In other words, \u201cit\u2019s a cover-up!\u201d said Colbert in the style of the Price is Right. \u201cHe\u2019s won an all-you-can-televise impeachment hearing, a trial in the world-famous Capitol building and a free helicopter ride out of Washington on Marine One. Marine One: ride away in shame in style.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also took a closer look at the House\u2019s impeachment vote, which left Trump and his allies \u201cfreaking out\u201d. Trump was so \u201cwildly grasping at straws\u201d about the vote, according to Meyers, that on Thursday morning he merely tweeted: \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d \u201cYeah, we did,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cThat\u2019s how we found out about the crimes you committed. Trump\u2019s like a bank robber who screams: \u2018Watch the tape!\u2019 And the jury watches the tape and it\u2019s just him smiling straight into the camera holding up a bag of cash.\u201d Several Republican congressmen spoke in defense of Trump \u2013 or, more accurately, as Meyers noted, spoke in confusing opposition to the impeachment inquiry process. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, for example, demanded the American people ask questions of history in a speech Meyers summarized as: \u201cHistory will write this moment and then history will ask you a question so you want them to ask the historian a question and then answer the questions themselves?\u201d His reasoning \u201csounds like you asked Siri to read a quote from Alexander Hamilton after spilling water on your phone\u201d. The House vote allows for more witnesses to be called for public testimony, including the former national security adviser John Bolton, who contentiously left the White House in September. Since then, tensions have escalated between Trump and Bolton, \u201cbut the best part is these are all awful guys\u201d, Meyers said. \u201cBolton\u2019s an unrepentant warmonger, Trump of course is Trump, so it\u2019s fun to watch them turn on each other and try to take each other down. \u201cI don\u2019t like watching nature shows where a lion kills a baby antelope but when they show a spider and a scorpion going at it, I am in.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel took the stage dressed as an orange circus peanut for Halloween. \u201cI think I said I wanted to dress the same color as the president\u2019s face and this is what happened,\u201d he said of the costume. \u201cIt was not a happy Halloween for the Sour Patch Kid in the Oval Office,\u201d said Kimmel. The House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry, \u201cwhich means \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it means\u201d, Kimmel admitted. \u201cIt means it will go to the Senate, and Republicans in the Senate will do nothing about it, and he\u2019ll say he won, is probably what it means.\u201d Still, Trump was not happy, tweeting that the impeachment inquiry was the greatest witch-hunt in American history on Halloween, and \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich, this is like Lori Loughlin saying, \u2018Check my kid\u2019s SAT scores!\u2019\u201d said Kimmel. No House Republicans voted in favor of the impeachment resolution, and the Senate\u2019s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, blasted Democrats for \u201ctaking a vacation from the needs of the American people\u201d. \u201cIn other words, instead of wasting time on this, you should be sending over more legislation for me to kill,\u201d Kimmel explained. McConnell, Kimmel noted, is sitting on more than 100 bills right now \u2013 \u201che uses them to nest his terrarium\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
