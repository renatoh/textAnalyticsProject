But we may know far better by the end of today whether Boris Becker's assessment of Mario Ancic draws more upon his experience as the youngest man to win Wimbledon or upon the need to create a bit of TV drama. We do know already that there are other famous players who reckon the 20-year-old Croatian's crushing victory over Tim Henman is a reliable guide to Ancic's current standard as a grass-court player. Among them is Goran Ivanisevic, Wimbledon favourite as well as mentor, hero, hitting partner, occasional coach, friend, and frequent text messager to Ancic, and just about the last person who would want to put unnecessary pressure on his young compatriot with premature remarks. Ivanisevic's most quoted advice to his protege is to \"keep on breaking the rackets\", intended not just to be roguishly humorous but to emphasise the importance of getting overly uptight. One of his current comments is that Ancic \"is a fantastic talent, and now he is in the semi-final he can do it all\". Even Andy Roddick, who has to deal with that talent today, appears to agree. \"It takes more than one tournament to become a consistent contender, you know,\" Roddick said after reaching the semi- finals by beating Sjeng Schalken. \"But he has the tools to develop into one. That's for sure. He's got weapons and he's a competitor. He fights every match. A lot of the elements are there for that to happen.\" Roddick's view is convincing, particularly because he had a rough ride before over coming Ancic 6-1 in the final set at Queen's a fortnight ago. If Roddick were to hit short, Ancic would reach the forecourt in three strides, usually controlling the net with his long reach, and often displaying soft hands as he did it. Ancic has other grass-court virtues. His serve is heavy and steep, and his instincts to move forward have been consistently encouraged, quite against the trends in tennis, from a young age. And although he says of Ivanisevic, \"We are both from Split and there is not too much different with our temperament,\" he has appeared much less volcanic than the imploring, praying and clowning 2001 Wimbledon champion. Fortunately the \"son of Goran\" media-convenient tag applies pressures to Ancic which appear mostly to motivate. There is the intoxication of receiving the country's baton, as Mats Wilander did from Bjorn Borg in the 80s, and the patriotic need to nurture an infant nation. But negatives there are. Ancic has had several coaches, which may militate against consistent progress. His 6ft 4in frame is not the most manoeuvrable and, despite having won 10 of his past 12 matches on grass, he gets less practice than he would like on this, the most treacherous of surfaces. There is, so they say, only one grass court in Croatia. But at least here there is a happy precedent. When Jan Kodes won Wimbledon in 1973, there was only one grass court in Czechoslovakia - his own. But perhaps crucially, a big win against Henman on Wednesday and a big win against Roger Federer here two years ago is barely adequate experience for success on a really big occasion. Roddick certainly acquired that while winning last year's US Open, which matured him as a person and as a player. Roddick has also been trying to increase his net attacks, something at which he has been making less rapid progress. His instinct is for following up smoking serves with fiery inside-out forehands and plundering what wreckage remains from the baseline. This preference may be one-dimensional but could have an extra advantage today. Ancic enjoyed having a target to aim at when Henman came pouring forward, something which some say he might have done less relentlessly. Roddick will mostly come forward only when he is in a position to finish a rally off. That may give us hard-court-style rallies, with players hitting heavily from the back or trying to work their way forward. But when Ancic serves he should serve and volley, something which, especially on the second delivery, he did better than Henman. \"He's playing very, very well,\" Henman said. \"I'll be intrigued to see how other players cope with it. And if someone copes with it and beats him it will be an element of interest to see what worked.\" The American's record-breaking 153mph serve and a ferocious follow-up is probably the answer to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
