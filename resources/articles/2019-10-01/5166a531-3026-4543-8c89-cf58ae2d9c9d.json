Dacre, who still holds the title of editor-in-chief at the Daily Mail\u2019s parent company DMG Media, has written a letter to the Financial Times [paywall] accusing Greig of being \u201ceconomic with the actualit\u00e9\u201d in a recent interview. The former editor took particular issue with a claim by Greig that hundreds of new companies had started buying adverts with the newspaper in the last year. The implication by Greig was that they had found the outlet too toxic under Dacre\u2019s leadership, following sustained campaigns from groups such as Stop Funding Hate, which targeted companies that advertised in the newspaper. \u201cHe claims 265 advertisers came back to the Daily Mail in his year as editor. In fact, far more than that number left during the same period,\u201d said Dacre. The former boss pointed out that under his editorship the newspaper \u201cwon an unprecedented number of awards for the quality of its journalism and its countless great campaigns, whether launching the war on plastic, cleaning up Britain, Alzheimer\u2019s awareness, Dignity for the Elderly or justice for Stephen Lawrence\u201d, before suggesting that his successor has come nowhere close. \u201cAs for Mr Greig, I congratulate him for making a solid start as editor and continuing so many of those campaigns but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll forgive me for suggesting that he (or his PR) defers his next lunch with the FT until he has notched up a small fraction of those journalists\u2019 achievements.\u201d There is reportedly no love lost between the two men after Brexit-backing Dacre was moved aside last year to make way for remain-supporting Greig. But the public row will put pressure on the company\u2019s executives to resolve any power struggle between the pair. The FT reported that Greig declined to comment on his predecessor\u2019s letter. The decision by the Daily Mail owner, Viscount Rothermere, to replace Dacre followed a run of front pages that left the newspaper facing substantial criticism for its increasingly strident demands to leave the EU, including its infamous \u201cenemies of the people\u201d front page attack on the high court judges who ruled that the prime minister could not trigger article 50 without parliamentary consent. This week Greig decided to launch a prominent campaign encouraging readers to ensure that their children were inoculated with MMR vaccine. He also publicly apologised for the newspaper\u2019s historical role in spreading fears about the vaccine\u2019s disproven links to autism during Dacre\u2019s editorship. A spokesperson for DMG Media said: \u201cOver the last 12 months Mail newspapers has grown its market share of UK press advertising. \u201cThe advertising revenue from the 265 new advertisers in Mail newspapers more than offset the loss from those advertisers we didn\u2019t see in the past financial year. We are delighted that revenue from advertising in print and digital was substantially greater than last year.\u201d Dacre, who edited the newspaper for a quarter of a century, is still thought to be close to the Mail on Sunday editor, Ted Verity, his former deputy who had turned the previously Remain-supporting Sunday newspaper into one more supportive of Brexit. While Dacre was a strident pro-Brexiter, almost at any cost, Greig has adopted a slightly more nuanced position at the Daily Mail, backing Theresa May\u2019s attempt at a withdrawal deal and and instead focusing his attention on Jeremy Corbyn. He told the FT last week that his main concern was ensuring a new Conservative government. \u201cMain mantra: ABC. Anything But Corbyn. I\u2019d much rather have no deal than Corbyn. We\u2019re going to support Boris if he does call an election \u2026 After Brexit, I think Boris will seem quite a centrist figure.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2019 to correct details of the high court decision that led to the Daily Mail\u2019s \u201cenemies of the people\u201d front page."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
