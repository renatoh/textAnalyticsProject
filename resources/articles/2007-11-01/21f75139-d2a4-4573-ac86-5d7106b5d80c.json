Living away from home for the first time and starting university would worry any 18-year-old. Doing so when the cash you depend on - your student loan - has still not turned up weeks into term is terrifying. \"I have stopped going out,\" says Sturley, a Bristol University geology student from Hampshire, who is waiting for a loan worth about \u00a31,500. \"I applied for the loan in late May, before the deadline. It's November now. The other day, I received a letter from Bristol reminding me I had fees to pay. I don't know how I'm going to pay them.\" Another first year, who wants to be known only as \"Ethel\", says she faces no option but to \"jack university in\" if her loan does not come very soon. \"I have two children to feed and a roof to keep over our heads,\" says the London School of Economics student, who lives in Islington, London. She is waiting for about \u00a34,000, but does admit she posted the form in August, a month late. Six weeks into their first year at university, students across England (the rest of the UK works differently) are still waiting for loans they should have received at the start of term. 'The worst year' Several student finance advisers who work for universities have branded this year \"the worst yet\" for delays. Loans for all students, not just those in their first year, are expected to be in the region of \u00a32.9bn this year. For some freshers, the loan is their only source of income. What with rent, fees, textbooks and the odd pint in the union, they are wondering how they are supposed to make ends meet. \"I've got \u00a31.47 in my purse. That's not even lunch money for one of my children,\" says Ethel. Some of the student finance advisers admit that this year, more than usual, their universities have been forced to dip into hardship loans. \"We've given double the number of emergency loans this year compared to the same time last year,\" says one. \"The majority will have been delayed funding loans.\" \"This year has definitely been worse than usual here,\" says another. \"We have had a number of students who have had serious delays on their support.\" Another says: \"This year has been the worst in my memory. All students whose fee support hasn't been sorted out at the start of term are referred to us. We saw around 1,000 students in the first week of term, of whom almost 700 didn't yet have their funding in place.\" Bristol University's student union president, Tobin Webb, is aware of \"a large number of cases\" of students who had not received their loan money by the start of the academic year, despite filling in the forms on time. \"Thankfully, the university and the students' union have short-term loan facilities for students in situations like this and we have been able to support our members.\" Oddly, while some universities seem to have many more cases like Sturley's this year, others say they are experiencing only the same number of delays as usual. One student finance adviser has even noticed fewer delays than in the past. Several theories on the reasons for the backlog are doing the rounds. The most common is that the system is in transition. From 2009, a centralised student finance service based in Darlington will take over the processing of student loans from local education authorities. Until then, except for 11 authorities that have already handed control to Darlington, LEAs assess a student's eligibility and the amount they are entitled to. The Student Loans Company then checks this. When a university confirms the student has enrolled, the SLC sends the money to the student. Students and money advisers say LEAs, already understaffed, are now allocating fewer resources and staff into the processing of loans, as they know that after next year, they will no longer be needed. One council worker, who calls herself \"Roxalana\", agrees this is the reason for the hold-ups in student loans this year. She posted a message to students on moneysavingexpert.com. It reads: \"Just want everyone to know that people (like me) who work for local authorities do care and also hate how long everything takes. It takes six to eight weeks to process an application due to the large queues. We have experienced large staff cuts this year, even though the Student Loans Company is yet to take over the processing of our applications. This has left us with the equivalent of just five full-time members of staff to process around 4,500 applications - eek! Unless the powers that be receive complaints, they will assume we are coping.\" Roxalana says she is now processing student loan applications she would normally deal with in July. On time The LEAs of Hampshire and Islington, through which Sturley and Ethel applied for their student loans, say all applications received within the deadline were dealt with on time. Not so, according to Sturley. A spokeswoman from Hampshire says: \"Everyone who returned their correctly completed forms with all the required supporting documentation by the deadline would have received their loan ready for starting their course.\" It is for just this reason that many others explain the delays: scores of students have failed to give their applications in on time and without mistakes this year, they say. The SLC denies there have been more delays than ever in the 900,000 loans and grants it has paid out. Quite the opposite, it argues. \"We have exceeded the targets set by the government and, in round figures, this year represents the best year yet in a succession of years of steady improvement,\" a company spokesman says. \"We would say that in the majority of cases, it is our experience that payments are late because applications are made late or students or sponsors don't supply all the necessary information. Because of the sheer numbers applying all at the same time for the same type of assistance, we are obliged, along with our colleagues in LEAs, to deal with applications in huge numbers. We have had very few complaints about LEAs and loans. We believe the local authorities take their responsibilities very seriously. They are managing the transition responsibly.\" If that is the case, says Sturley, how come you have to wait 45 minutes to get through to the LEAs? \"It's obvious they can't handle the number of calls,\" she says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
