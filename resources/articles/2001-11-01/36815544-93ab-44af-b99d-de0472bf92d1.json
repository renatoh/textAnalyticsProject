Even clad in their tracksuits they might well have been part of the 9-5 set, such was the lack of interest from passers-by. \"Not one person recognised us,\" he recalled. \"We might as well have been office workers.\" How times change. If the present crop are victorious here on Thursday, having arrived in the Iranian capital last night for the return leg of their World Cup play-off, the Football Association of Ireland expects thousands of fans to welcome them at Dublin airport in the early hours of Friday. First things first, however, and the early impressions of this ancient, polluted city - \"even the most effusive travel agent would have difficulty praising it,\" says one travel guide - went some way to soothing any lingering concerns about security. Some 60 Iran fans formed a noisy welcoming committee at Mehrabad airport but, while they were boisterous, the reception never bordered on the sinister, making some of the scare stories of the past few weeks seem slightly preposterous. \"People jump to a lot of conclusions. I keep getting asked if I'm worried about security but there is no need to fret whatsoever,\" said McCarthy. \"I was treated with great respect when I came here a week or two ago and, for me, there isn't even an issue.\" That said, the alcohol-free environment will be hard enough for the few hundred travelling fans to bear, as will the other culture clashes. No such discomforts for the team, of course, but the Azadi, a crumbling bear-pit of a stadium where Iran have not lost a competitive match since it was built in 1972, certainly has the appearance to match its reputation of not being a place for the faint-hearted. \"I have been winding up Ian Harte, telling him how scary it will be,\" Harry Kewell said yesterday, recalling Australia's World Cup play-off here in 1997 in which the Leeds United player scored in a 1-1 draw. \"It was just deafening. Then I scored and there was total silence. It was eerie. They were in shock for a minute and then suddenly it erupted again. \"I remember their fans were trying to throw fruit at us from the back of the stand but the ground was so massive it just hit the people at the front. Added to the fact that no women were allowed in, so it was just 100,000-plus guys, it was a totally unique experience. I'll certainly never forget playing there.\" What is certain is that, without the injured Roy Keane, McCarthy will need steady heads. Niall Quinn and Steve Staunton, two of the more experienced players, are struggling with injuries but the medical bulletin indicated both should be available. McCarthy was reluctant to talk at length about Keane, pointing out that, as captains of Premiership clubs, Matt Holland and Mark Kinsella would be more than adequate in midfield. Kinsella said: \"I'm fully fit now and I think Matt and I can show together that there is more to this team than just Roy Keane.\" However, that does not disguise the fact that, when they pay their first visit today to the Azadi, known here as the Fortress, the squad might realise just how much their captain will be missed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
