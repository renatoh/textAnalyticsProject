Now he looks back at what happened, and what might have happened. As he says: I learned some things last year, about media, about citizens, about myself. Although citizen media, broadly defined, was taking the world by storm, the experiment with Bayosphere didn't turn out the way I had hoped. Many fewer citizens participated, they were less interested in collaborating with one another, and the response to our initiatives was underwhelming. I would do things differently if I was starting over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
