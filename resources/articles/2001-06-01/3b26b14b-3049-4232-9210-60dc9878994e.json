A quango (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation) by the name of the Senior Salaries Review Body. Appointed by the cabinet office minister (now John Prescott, but previous incumbants have included Jack Cunningham and Mo Mowlam), these \"great and the good\" include such non-household names as the company director, Sir Michael Perry, and Mr George Staple, QC. One name that may ring a bell, however, is former union leader Brenda Dean, who led the fight against Rupert Murdoch's move to Wapping. She is now Baroness Brenda Dean of Thorton-le-Fylde. Their job is to recommend the salaries for top politicians and civil servants. So why have they waited until just after the election to deliver these bumper bonuses? They haven't. They recommended the substantial increases back in February, but, with a general election approaching, the Downing Street response was: \"We will look at this but we cannot see any changes. Ministers are more focused on foot and mouth rather than looking at their own pay.\" Although foot and mouth continues, Mr Blair has decided, with the election safely out of the way, that the SSRB's recommendation is one of those \"tough decisions\" he is willing to take. So just how much is the increase? That depends on who you are. The prime minister gets the biggest increase, from \u00a3116,339 to \u00a3163,418. Cabinet ministers in the Commons were paid \u00a399,793 (including MPs salary). This rises to \u00a3117,979. Cabinet ministers in the Lords had been taking \u00a374,911. This rises to \u00a388,562. Backbench MPs will receive \u00a349,822 from April 1. This will increase to \u00a353,822 from April 1 2002. Best paid of all is Lord Irvine, the lord chancellor, who will receive a 3.7% increase above inflation on his current salary of \u00a3173,875. As the head of the judiciary, he historically earns more than the prime minister. What's that in context? Assuming the PM was paid the minimum wage of \u00a34.20 an hour, and assuming he works a ten hour day, six days a week, 50 weeks a year (which is probably a conservative estimate), he'd be on \u00a312,600 per annum. A newly-qualified teacher on \u00a316,038, receiving a similar pay increase to the prime minister's, would jump to \u00a322,533. The national average salary is \u00a319,104 - that's 11% of the PM's salary. Uniquely among major political parties, the leader of the Socialist Alliance, Dave Nellist, pledged to take a \"worker's wage\" if he became prime minister last Thursday. That would have saved the British taxpayer \u00a3153,968. But what's the Alastair Campbell context on this? On the Downing Street website, the prime minister's official spokesman, said: \"Since May 1997, the prime minister had waived some 41% of his salary. Cabinet ministers in the commons had waived around 27% of their salary. The recommendations had been put forward by independent pay experts in two reports. \"It was not the case that the cabinet and government had simply come in, thought of a figure and awarded themselves a pay rise.\" Mr Campbell earns \u00a3102,000 a year. Is that true, or is it just spin? It is true that in the wake of Mr Blair's 1997 election triumph, he had informed cabinet colleagues they would not take their recommended rise, prompting the widely-circulated remark from John Prescott: \"It's alright for you Tony - your wife makes \u00a3350,000 a year. My wife spends \u00a3350,000 a year.\" For the last four years, cabinet ministers have only taken an inflation-linked increase, forgoing around \u00a314,000 a year. The most recent SSRB review reprimanded this hair-shirt attitude as distorting the ministerial pay system, and recommended the cabinet take their full increase. The cabinet agreed. Talk about it Cabinet ministers - should they be paid the national average salary?
