A deal could be announced at any moment,\" the source told the Reuters news agency after US, British and Libyan officials met in London. Under the arrangement, Libya would compensate families of the 259 passengers and crew killed in the mid-air explosion of the Pan Am flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988 and the 11 people killed on the ground. Tripoli would pay up to \u00a36.2m per victim into a special trust account in return for a series of steps to remove sanctions against it, the source said. That would make the total value of the settlement roughly \u00a31.68bn if all conditions were met. The deal would end a lingering dispute between the west and an Arab state shortly before a likely US-led war against Iraq. A Libyan intelligence agent, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, was convicted of the crime by a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
