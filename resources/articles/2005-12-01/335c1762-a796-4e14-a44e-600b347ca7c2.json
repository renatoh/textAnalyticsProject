The west London coroner, Alison Thompson, will today preside over inquests into the deaths on Boxing Day last year of 93 British adults and children in Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, in a hearing due to last four days. As a coroner's court would have been unsuitable for the largest multiple inquest to be held in England since the Hillsborough disaster, relatives, police, geological experts and medical witnesses, will be accommodated in the Olympia conference centre, west London. Of the 141 Britons who died in the tsunami, most were in Thailand. British law requires inquests to be held in 93 of the cases where bodies were repatriated. In six cases bodies have yet to be found and identified in Thailand and inquests cannot be held. Ms Thompson has allocated 15-minute slots for each individual death which will begin after expert witnesses, including geologists, give evidence about the events last Boxing Day in south-east Asia. For many relatives, who are preparing to fly to Thailand and Sri Lanka for the first anniversary of the disaster, the timing of the inquest could not have been worse. They say they were not consulted on the timing, have been left in the dark about the details of the hearing, and feel they have been treated as an afterthought rather than priority. In the aftermath of a highly critical report by the National Audit Office last week into the way Foreign Office officials dealt with relatives in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, some families say they are being let down again by the authorities. Many have decided to stay away from today's hearing. Michael Pitt, who lost his nephew, Tom Fairbairn, sister Carole Fairbairn, and her husband, Colin, in the disaster, has communicated with several families through the Tsunami Support network set up by the Red Cross. He said: \"It's horrendous. The formalities of death certificates have already been conducted in Thailand so all this is a very strange experience. I learnt about the inquest from members of my brother-in-law's family in America. I still don't know the format of it. \"This is all part of the ongoing communication problems throughout this whole process. It is clearly distressing a number of people.\" Like other families, Mr Pitt has written a eulogy to his dead relatives but was told he could not read it at the hearing. \"I wanted to but apparently I can't because it would take too long to read out and the officials are worried about running over time in the conference centre. What message does that send out?\" All the personal tributes at the hearing will be read by court officials or police liaison officers. Alan Jones, whose 24-year-old daughter, Charlotte, died on Rachai Yai island, Thailand, said: \"There is a paucity of information about this. I think the timing is quite insensitive. \"People talk about closure but we don't relate to closure. Our lives are devastated and will be for the rest of our natural born days, so we don't understand why this is being held now when we are preparing to cope in our own ways one year on. \"Most families are still in a state of shock and disbelief, and I just don't understand why it could not have been later.\" Ms Thompson is not making any comment before today's hearing, but a spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's department, which shares responsibility for the operation of the coroner, said the decision to hold the hearing within weeks of the anniversary of the tsunami depended on the availability of the coroner and on the venue. Stefan Popper, who as coroner presided over the Hillsborough inquest into the deaths of 96 football fans, had some sympathy for those in charge of the inquest's logistics. \"It is a difficult thing to organise,\" he said. \"What I tried to do was give enough time to each individual family so they felt that their loved one was considered as an individual who had a life and family and friends. It looks like they are trying to do the same thing with this hearing.\" Case study Quest for truth and healing Alan Jones treasures the last photograph, far left, taken of his 24-year-old daughter Charlotte. It shows her taking part in a fire dance on the beach in Racha Yai, the Thai resort where she spent last Christmas and where, on Boxing Day, she was swept away. Mr Jones and his wife, from Petersfield, Hampshire, are preparing to fly to Thailand next week on a memorial pilgrimage. \"We have to go,\" he said. \"We have to be there at this time.\" Many other families are also travelling to attend ceremonies being organised by the Thai government. As of yesterday, 78 families had taken up an offer from Britain's Foreign Office of two business class tickets and five days accommodation in Thailand. Another 15 families are going to Sri Lanka. Charlotte Jones was travelling on a gap year when she died. Her parents have raised \u00a318,000 to set up a memorial scholarship scheme to help teenage girls in Thailand, where many are forced to leave school early to support families. Mr Jones says he has no idea how his daughter's body came to be found. If today's inquest provides anything, he hopes it may be able to fill in the gaps of what happened to her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
