I've never tried it and doubt I would, not because at the innocent and tender age of 48 I'm such a swell guy - excuse the pun - in fact, I'm usually too busy teaching the world to relax to even consider such things (indeed, I'm not far off being a male nun these days), but because it scares me to imagine becoming dependant on a pill to enjoy sex. Yet you only have to mention such things to any well-meaning friend and he offers you a spare Viagra he just happens to have lying around, its use seems so endemic these days. Having treated people for many years for sexual dysfunction in the tradition both of Taoist doctors and Wilhelm Reich - who believed sexual dysfunction was at the core of all physical, emotional and psychological problems - I've seen that except for physical impediment, erectile dysfunction and its female equivalent, including problems ranging from lack of interest to vaginismus, can usually be sorted by a combination of psychotherapeutic and energy work involving herbs and point stimulation. This may seem a one-sided chat, with an emphasis on the boys - maybe inspired by the recent overkill of images of phallic symbols moving rapidly across and exploding in the corner of our TV screens - but the issue is of equal importance to both sexes. It seems from conversations with many men that nervousness about the ability to achieve and sustain a full erection is widespread. Perhaps with women being more financially independent, socially confident and hence sexually more predatory, the boys feel off-balanced, unclear as to strategy, and hence more sexually insecure. Moreover, the stress of war-torn, economically uncertain, ecologically shaky modern life, as well as the long hours necessary to stay in the game, wears down your kidney energy, which controls your libido levels. On top of that lies the confusion on the male part about politically correct behaviour - how far to let their maleness shine through or play the 'new man', along with the pressure of living up to the multi-orgasmic expectations of the media-saturated modern woman. So Willy is nervous but short of Viagra - what to do? While there's no short cut to get to the deep-seated reasons for the low self-esteem patterns that undermine your sexual confidence, or to root out the latent sexual shame that makes you withdraw - for this you need a competent therapist - you can certainly make a start by using affirmations. Keep repeating: 'I am a fully functioning, healthy sexual being, able to express my deepest sexuality during the sexual act to the highest degree at all times!' and notice the negative thoughts your mind throws up in response - 'No I'm not, I'm always too tired', or 'No I'm not, I'm too fat', for example. Simply noticing the negative beliefs you've been holding on to about yourself helps dislodge the pattern. As it slowly infiltrates your unconscious, constant repetition of the affirmation will gradually instil you with more sexual confidence. Keep it up daily for three months for best results (so many puns...). As for herbs, while I've tried most well-known sexual remedies over the years, the one that seems to have the most effect is the sustainable-crop Brazilian rainforest tree bark Catuaba, two to six capsules of which taken daily for three months strengthens sexual response for men and women and also helps soothe your nerves because it affects kidney energy, which as well as fuelling your rising sap also controls the nerves. Finally, to trigger kidney energy appropriately to enhance your sexuality, press with the fingers of one hand into your perineum, the muscle between your legs, between genitals and anus, and massage gently but firmly by turning in clockwise circles 81 times, twice a day, for three months. I hope you didn't find my writing style too stiff. Dear Barefoot Can you recommend anything for depression? My daughter, who is 28, seems to suffer from cycles of depression. Do you think acupressure or acupuncture would work? Anne Parkes Depression, no matter its psycho-emotional causes, arises when liver energy is weak, so yes, to some extent acupuncture and/or Chinese herbs could help balance the cycle, as would taking up a daily psychophysical discipline like t'ai chi or even running or rock climbing - though obviously it could also be helpful to begin therapy in order to discover what triggered it initially. I am wondering if you could point me in the right direction of some form of healing for uncontrollable jealousy. I try to swallow it but then it turns into an internal rage eating away at me, and this is all to do with my boyfriend having any other interest apart from me. Valerie Jealousy arises when the spleen and liver energy are out of harmony. Spleen energy gives us the ability to accept things as they are and liver energy stops anguish and rage. When energy is deficient in these organs simultaneously, the slightest provocation can trigger the demon. To antidote, press in under the ribs on the right until you feel slightly winded, then do the same on the left. Take a deep breath and say aloud: 'The more generous I am in allowing those around me to enjoy their own space, the more generous life is to me in every way and everyone wins!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
