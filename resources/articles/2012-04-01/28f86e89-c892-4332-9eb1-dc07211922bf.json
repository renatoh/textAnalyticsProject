Frankly, I don't give a damn", "bodyText": "Are you glad you had children? Have you decided not to have children? Either way, would it be possible for us all to get back to the good old days of just getting on with the decision and refraining from boring everyone else rigid with endless self-justifications? Oxford-educated television historian Dr Lucy Worsley is the latest to become entangled in the \"to breed or not to breed\" debate. Speaking to the Radio Times, she declared: \"I have been educated out of the natural reproductive function. I get to spend my time doing things I enjoy.\" She added: \"I have become the poster girl for opting out of reproduction.\" In fairness to Worsley, I don't think she was sneering at the non-Oxbridge gestating hordes. Rather than an artless outburst, this had the whiff of a carefully prepared speech, presumably so that Worsley could bat away meaningful glances at her poor \"barren\" tummy. Or deflect people too dismayed and incensed by her lack of interest in procreation to realise that, hey, it's none of their business. Increasingly, there seems to be a culture of over-justification around procreation and non-procreation, leading to the sort of polarised, high-emotion debates where all parties are as dogmatic, self-obsessed and unpleasant as each other. Only in one area does there seem to be any kind of agreement: the \"child-free\" man is deemed one (moderately interesting) thing, while a (warped!) woman is quite another. Even relatively recently, defiantly airing a lack of interest in having children was a courageous act for a female, on a par with offering herself up to be burnt alive in media Salem. Startled by the often near-apocalyptic reactions, one always wondered whether the most damningly critical had just spent a day picking their little darlings' Lego out of steaming cat litter and needed to make themselves feel better by venting strident self-justification for their life choice. However, recently, a new toxic element has emerged among the non-procreative, complete with a derogatory vocabulary. At which point in our magical human history did it become OK to scorn people with children as \"breeders\"? How is that clever or nice, Mr or Ms \"I'm-going-to-be-able-to-retire-at-45\" non-breeder? Not that the biological destiny mob are behaving much better. Their attitude towards the child-free appears to range from tired accusations of being \"unnatural\" to the bloodcurdling shriek of: \"Don't ask my kids or grandkids to wipe your 95-year-old arse when there's no one else to do it!\" To which one could only reply: well, why not, if that's their job? Vilest of all is when women come forward with heartfelt regrets over their missed opportunities to have children. At this point, there is usually an eruption of barely disguised told-you-so glee from the smug procreating masses. If it was because of the woman's (hiss, spit) career, it almost becomes the self-justification Olympics. Gold medals all round for lack of humanity. There are always going to be people who are unable to have children, for whatever reason. Those who have the luxury of choice should realise that it's possible to make a decision without ramming that decision down people's throats or flying into a moral panic if others disagree. Having a conversation with someone about having children can be fun and interesting, but it's still just that \u2013 a conversation. It doesn't say everything you need to know about that person. While Lucy Worsley can be entertaining on not wanting children, she is arguably even more so on areas of history she loves. Indeed, having children or not is one of the biggest decisions you're going to make in your life. Time was, you made it privately. The current fashion for endlessly justifying your procreative choice, either way, has to be a contender for this era's most monotonous, self-absorbed bore-a-thon. Eternal teenagers? That is so unfair! Great news for people who refuse to grow up. Canadian research says that there may be a bona fide medical excuse for immaturity, giving rise to the term \"eternal adolescent\". Here comes the science bit: it's something to do with brain mapping, white matter and laying down neural highways that, in some people, continues past adolescence \u2013 in fact, up until the ages of 25-30. Alberta University tested 403 volunteers, between five and 83, concluding that \"post adolescence\" sometimes reached a peak between the ages of 20 and 30. Does this mean that I'm no longer allowed to laugh and point at skateboarders with beards or grown women in \"Little Miss Naughty\" T-shirts? By the same token, do I finally have an explanation for certain excruciating faux pas in my adult life, over which I must hastily draw a veil out of respect for the Observer's family readership? Let's just say (cough) that there have been times when I rather let myself down and we can move swiftly on to judging other people. More seriously, maybe I'm misunderstanding the science but one wonders about how much changing social factors contribute to the trend. The human brain can't have evolved that much in the last century, but these eternal adolescents didn't seem so numerous circa 1912. Faced with the imminence of the First World War, men between the ages of 20 and 30 were not known to cry: \"Forget fighting the Hun, man, I'm off clubbing, innit!\" On the Titanic, there wasn't a cry of: \"Women and children first, adults playing Xboxes to the rear!\" Whatever the era, the fact remains that eternal adolescents of both sexes tend to cause major problems on myriad levels. Probably best not to give them what amounts to a doctor's note saying that their brains are still growing. The Voice is great, but spare me the schmaltz With BBC's The Voice thrashing Britain's Got Talent in the Saturday ratings, you'd be forgiven for falling for the line: \"It's all about the voice, man!\" (Accompanied by choked sob, gaze into heavens, clutch of heart.) As a fan of The Voice, not least for the excellent chairbound boogying by the coaches, I still harbour grave suspicions. Even during the \"blind\" auditions, where the coaches had to bang on buttons and twizzle around in waltzer-style chairs to see contestants, only Tom Jones seemed to be \"turning around\" for anyone who sounded over-35. (Let's be frank, most singing voices and styles betray the singer's age.) When the groups were halved during last weekend's \"screech-offs\", the coaches kept mysteriously picking younger, prettier people, saying they were going for potential, rather than experience. Yeah, right. Donning my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker, methinks The Voice does not inhabit the moral high ground the way it thinks it does. It's just as ageist, sizeist and looksist as other talent shows; it's just a lot more polite about it. An entertaining show, and I'm hanging in there, but: \"It's just about the voice\"? Spare me the luvvie rubbish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
