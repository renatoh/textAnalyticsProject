Nell Freudenberger's fictional versions of the near-mythical underground performances that took place in Beijing's East Village in the years after the Tiananmen Square uprising animate a significant portion of her new novel, The Dissident, whose narrative is split between Beijing's East Village in the 1990s and the lush suburbs of early 21st-century Los Angeles. Yuan Zhao, cousin of one of the most celebrated of the Chinese underground artists, has come to LA on a fellowship as artist-in-residence at a girls' private school. His host family is the kind of gilded yet dysfunctional ur-American family we have come to recognise from American cinema. Gordon Travers, a psychoanalyst whose obsession with the Travers genealogy is matched only by his obtuseness in the face of the disaster that looms in his own life, is married to the immaculate and disarmingly sympathetic Cece. It comes as little surprise to discover that their depressed son, Max, has been caught in possession of a firearm, but, in fact, it is Max's hot Latino girlfriend, Jasmine, who really troubles his mother. Daughter Olivia, a high-school dance student with an incipient eating disorder and a manipulative minx of a best friend, looks to be on a collision course with her troubled ego for a good part of the next decade. Sibling rivalry and professional jealousy provide the opportunity for some wryly satirical set pieces involving Gordon's siblings, Joan, a novelist, and Phil, a failed actor turned writer who has just hit the jackpot with a million-dollar movie deal for his play about a woman who is conducting an illicit love affair with her husband's brother. Fortunately, nobody else in the family has read it. Freudenberger's first book, Lucky Girls, a prize-winning collection of five short stories, is a series of acutely observed tales of young American women living and travelling in south-east Asia and India. In The Dissident, she neatly inverts the paradigm, bringing the impassive eye of Yuan Zhao to bear on the Travers family, the embodiment of the American dream. With the sly juxtaposition of multiple viewpoints (there are four narrative voices), there is plenty of opportunity for the witty unpicking of various cultural assumptions. Yuan Zhao's brilliantly deadpan description of his accidental discovery of Phil in the Travers garden at 5am bearing a small cage inside which crouches a bush baby, a gift for Cece, is gloriously funny, both for the exquisite absurdity of the situation and for the linguistic misunderstandings. Freudenberger doesn't succeed in keeping up the intense energy that fires the best scenes in the novel. In some places, the pace slows to an almost lethargic rate, as though the Los Angeles perma-summer has soaked into the very pages of the book. The most significant problem is that Yuan Zhao's voice, which narrates of all the Beijing episodes, rings hollow. Though what he tells of is extraordinary, he fails to come alive. An unexpectedly happy-ever-after ending feels tacked on as a means to tie up loose ends, paradoxically leaving the abstract questions that pepper the story - questions of counterfeiting and copying, of authorship and authenticity and identity - finally unaddressed. This is not to detract from Freudenberger's achievement. The Dissident is so well put together that as soon as I finished it I was compelled to go back to the beginning to work out the sleight of hand that delivered such a satisfying twist to the plot. Her ear for the brittle conversation of families and her fascination for a brief period of contemporary Chinese culture are reason enough to applaud a debut novel of exceptional ambition and impressive assurance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
