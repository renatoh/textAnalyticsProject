If ever a country required a shot in the arm it is Spain, a nation that recently woke up to the fact that it has been living way beyond its means, with four million unemployed and the prospect of a double-dip recession. Psychologically the value of this victory is incalculable. At 8.30pm, a quarter of a million people gathered in the Paseo de Recoletos in Madrid to watch the giant screen, and close to 100,000 assembled around another screen close to the Plaza Espa\u00f1a in Barcelona. At the final whistle, the fireworks exploded across the country and it was as if the entire nation took to the streets. They rolled down Madrid's six-lane Paseo de la Castellana boulevard, they partied in Barcelona, in Bilbao, in Seville, in Santiago. \"It had to be [Andr\u00e9s] Iniesta, the field marshal of Spanish football,\" said the 19-year-old Marcos Domenec. Marta Seco, 22, was overcome with emotion. \"This is the greatest sporting event in the history of the country,\" she shouted, with tears in her eyes. In Madrid and Barcelona, the city authorities had erected barriers around the fountains where football victories are traditionally celebrated, but they looked unlikely to survive the long, sweltering night of celebrations. Over the past four weeks, across Spain the bars have turned themselves inside out, with the TV and all the tables in the street, and no one inside. In Barcelona, last night the Arc de Triomf bar in the city centre was draped in Spanish flags \u2013 a sight almost unthinkable in Barcelona \u2013 and a group in Spanish football shirts led the crowd in renditions of Viva Espa\u00f1a! and Soy Espa\u00f1ol (I am Spanish). Fans watching from a patio bar in a working-class neighbourhood of Madrid whooped in joy and yelled \"Spain! Spain!\" as they danced on bar chairs and hugged each other. Others yelled \"Yes! Yes! The Cup is now ours!\" \"It's just amazing, I almost don't believe it,\" said a beaming Feliciano Hernandez, a 25-year-old electrician. \"I'm so proud, totally happy and living for the moment and not thinking about anything else right now.\" Nacho Moreno, a 23-year-old waiter, danced in the street waving the Spanish flag he had kept wrapped around his head for luck during the game as cars drove by, honking their horns in salute. He said he would probably drink until dawn to celebrate. \"It's phenomenal! Spain won. I was really nervous but I knew it was possible,\" Moreno said. But among the crowd there were also Italians, Argentineans and an English couple sporting Spanish war paint \u2013 all rooting for Spain. At half time the bar owner popped the cork on a bottle of cava and sprayed the crowd, Formula 1 style. It may not last, but this is a victory for everyone in this divided country. Catalans have plenty to cheer about. The core of this team \u2013 Xavi, Puyol, Piqu\u00e9 and Busquets \u2013 are all Catalans and seven players on the pitch last night play for FC Barcelona. In fact, every single Spanish goal in the competition has been scored by a Bar\u00e7a player, including last night's winner scored by Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. This has been a truly national victory for a nation that is still struggling to find itself \u2013 or its several selves \u2013 35 years after the end of the dictatorship. Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero, the Spanish president, said of the team before the match: \"They have rejected fatalism and pessimism and turned them into confidence and joy. This is the image we want Spain to have in the 21st century.\" Economically, the party is well and truly over, but last night it was only just beginning, and as the crowds fanned out along the streets, everyone devoted themselves to the pursuit at which Spain were world champions long before this \u2013 la fiesta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
