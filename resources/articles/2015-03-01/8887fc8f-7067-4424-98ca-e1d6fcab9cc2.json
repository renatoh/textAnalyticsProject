Black had a front-row seat as Johnson-Thompson reaffirmed her position as the best women\u2019s multi-eventer on the planet by winning pentathlon gold at the European Indoor Championships in Prague \u2013 narrowly missing out on a world record by only 13 points. Ennis-Hill, meanwhile, gave birth to her son, Reggie, last year and has not competed since 2013. The 29-year-old has not attempted a heptathlon since winning gold at the London 2012 Olympics. However, Black says that everything he has seen suggests that Ennis-Hill\u2019s comeback is on track as she prepares to face Johnson-Thompson at the Hypo-Meeting in G\u00f6tzis. \u201cJess has put out a statement that she\u2019s going to be in G\u00f6tzis, she wants to be at the world championships, she understands it\u2019s a year of exploration and development,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all the feedback is that she is making great progression, so I think it\u2019s real.\u201d Black admitted he was also excited at the prospect of watching Johnson-Thompson, Ennis-Hill and the 17-year-old prodigy Morgan Lake at the same event. \u201cI just think it\u2019s an amazing set of circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that they are all going to be hopefully in G\u00f6tzis and they\u2019re all hopefully going to be at the World Championships this year, and the Olympics next year, it\u2019s just a kind of magical time. It is just going to be spectacular.\u201d Black also hinted that he believed Johnson-Thompson was capable of becoming only the fourth athlete in history to overhaul the 7,000 points barrier for the heptathlon, adding: \u201cI think that\u2019s her aim, I don\u2019t think the expectation is any less than that. None of us knows how good she can be, I think we\u2019re going to find out this year.\u201d Was he encouraged by how disappointed Johnson-Thompson was in not breaking the world record in Prague? \u201cYeah, I think it was brilliant, that\u2019s what I want her to be,\u201d he said. Britain finished with nine medals in Prague \u2013 more than any other country \u2013 and although they fell one short of their record tally at the European Indoor Championships, Black admitted he was \u201cchuffed\u201d with the performances of his young team. \u201cI think the expectation is that we\u2019ll now regularly medal and I think we\u2019ve re-established ourselves as a leading nation in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt demonstrates our strength in depth and shows we\u2019ve got a younger group of people who are all capable of medals.\u201d Meanwhile, Dina-Asher Smith, the supremely talented teenage sprinter, was singled out for special praise after equalling the British 60m record in winning silver behind Dafne Schippers. \u201cTo hold yourself together in a championship like that, to repeat high-level performances, to come back and equal the British record, I think it\u2019s kind of a fairytale,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very happy but she knows that it\u2019s a platform for bigger and better things, but those times and those competitions, that\u2019s competitive anywhere in the world.\u201d There was praise, too, for Richard Kilty, who added the European Indoor 60m title to last year\u2019s world indoor crown. \u201cI think he was just awesome,\u201d said Black. \u201cI think he\u2019s re-established himself as a serious sprinting candidate. He is working well together with his new coach, Linford Christie, and I think there\u2019s a lot more to come.\u201d However, Black insisted the British team would not be getting complacent before this year\u2019s world championships in Beijing and the 2016 Olympics in Rio. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, tough world out there and there\u2019s a lot of people waiting to grab those medals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very aware of that, we need to just keep going but get better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
