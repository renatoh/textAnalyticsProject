Mark \"Bez\" Berry, who surely stood to that cultural moment as Winston Churchill did to the second world war, appeared to have particular reason for worry: to most observers, his role as the onstage cheerleader for the Happy Mondays seemed to be predicated on dutifully taking as much E as he could get his hands on. As his Celebrity Big Brother victory proves, Bez remains a low-rent generational icon. And for his contemporaries - now knocking 40, and probably wary of even the occasional \"cheeky half\" - his time in the house may well have belatedly provided an answer to all those comedown anxieties. If you too necked the requisite medication like sweets, you should presumably be steeling yourself for such delights as declining hand-to-eye coordination and blunted linguistic capabilities - although you may have also recognised slightly more benign after-effects of your E-based wild years. During his 18 days, despite being in the company of people who would have driven most of us to violence, Bez largely remained kind, considerate, convivial, and happily adjusted to his own lowly place in the universe. Such is the grown-up version of acid house's \"loved-up\" mindset. It's just a shame that ascending to such Buddha-like grace also seems to involve spending half your life banging into things. With any luck, Bez's renewed (if temporary) place at the centre of pop-cultural developments might also nudge a few people towards those dusty corners of the UK's record shops that contain Happy Mondays records. Thanks partly to their end-of-the-pier reformation at the end of the 1990s, they have long been denied the retrospective plaudits heaped on their work-shy Mancunian peers the Stone Roses - but there are some days when I think the Mondays might just have been the better group. In fact, listening to their best records, I occasionally conclude that they may well be my favourite band ever. At this point, thanks to his sparing contribution to the band's art, we will leave Bez behind, and concentrate instead on the lyrical talent of Shaun Ryder, a man whose genius lay in three distinct areas. Firstly, he could second-guess the prevailing cultural wind with incredible prescience: such Mondays songs as Freaky Dancin' (1986) and 24 Hour Party People (1987) predicted the acid house upsurge at a time when most musicians were indulging in nothing more mind-expanding than cannabis and Newcastle Brown Ale. Secondly, Ryder recurrently nailed the more pained aspects of the human condition with laser-like insight. Has there ever been a better opening couplet than the one that began 1990's Kinky Afro: \"Son, I'm 30, I only went with your mother 'cos she's dirty\"? Respects should also be paid to his crystallisation of the moment at which the Mondays' success curdled on the following year's Judge Fudge: \"I should have told you/That the things that you love start to own you,\" Ryder yelped, like King Midas in upmarket sportswear. And 1992's Stinkin' Thinkin', meanwhile, may well have been his masterpiece: a croakily-delivered hymn to dysfunction, addiction and regret that proved that love songs need not be either soppy or cliched. Which brings us to his third trump card: his incredible facility with words. In the wake of the Mondays' demise (accelerated by his fondness for crack cocaine), Ryder formed Black Grape, who announced their arrival with a debut single that, for some reason, explained the 1930s concordat between Hitler and the Vatican. It's all in Reverend Black Grape's second verse: \"Old pope he got the Nazis to clean up their messes/In exchange for gold and paintings/He gave them new addresses.\" History, at a stroke, was incisively rewritten in Ryder's own kind of jive-talk. Bob Dylan used to do things like that. If Ryder's lyrics were inspired, the music created by his first band could be no less jaw-dropping. They were probably the last British group to decisively escape the past and come out sounding like no one else on earth. Whose influence was detectable in the lysergic murk of the 1988 album they poetically titled Bummed? What precedent was there for the collision of melodic rock and sun-kissed dance aesthetics on 1990's Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches? In response to their wonders, rock critics did what rock critics always do, and blithely cited records they had obviously never heard. The Mondays, we were told, had got it all from Funkadelic. As impressionable 18-year-olds do, I duly bought some Funkadelic records. They were good - but they sounded nothing like Happy Mondays. So yes, the Mondays were utterly, absurdly great. The veterans of the ecstasy wars whose hearts were warmed by Bez's victory should take note: the finest minds of their generation might have got irrevocably bent out of shape, but they did well. Really well. \u00b7 John Harris is the author of So Now Who Do We Vote For? published by Faber and Faber at \u00a37.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
