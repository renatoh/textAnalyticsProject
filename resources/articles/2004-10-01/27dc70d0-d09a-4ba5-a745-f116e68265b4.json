After considerable correspondence with BT, I have just received my \u00a320 but the friend who recommended me has received nothing. IH, Norwich YOU both bought BT's cheapest broadband package, which was not eligible for the cashback offer at that time. When you contacted BT in September, it assumed it had mistakenly left you off the list as, by then, the offer had been extended to the basic package. BT sent you \u00a320. When your friend complained, BT knew he was not eligible, so did nothing. Because of the mix-up, BT has agreed to send your friend \u00a320 plus another \u00a320 compensation. Bringing father to book MY MOTHER died last April and my 90-year-old father had been looking after her for some months. Without my knowledge, he had borrowed heavily to try to make life more comfortable for them. That he was allowed to borrow \u00a390,000 unsecured is quite beyond belief. I have enduring power of attorney and am sorting out this mess as best I can. I need to pay bills by cheque but the Nationwide Flexaccount I set up does not allow cheques, presumably because of my father's appalling credit standing. I do not want overdraft facilities but it is frustrating not being able to write cheques. JH, Colchester THIS was opened as a card-only account. When, with power of attorney, you asked for a cheque book, Nationwide checked your father's background, not yours, as he is main account holder. His credit history had caused the problem. Nationwide will now give you a cheque book without overdraft facility. Transatlantic contribution FOR the eight years that my English brother has lived in the US, he has had British National Insurance contributions deducted from his pay by his UK employer. He has just been told that NI contributions can be paid only for one year when out of the country and his contributions for the preceding year have been refunded. He is worried that now he is not paying either this or the US equivalent. JMcD, Manningtree HIS British employer should have deducted Class 1 NI contributions for only 12 months and then stopped. That is why he had a refund. He can either pay the US equivalent contribution and have a gap in his UK record, or voluntarily pay UK contributions, including Class 2 at a flat rate of \u00a32.05 a week. He can backdate contributions for a maximum of six years, which will leave him one year short, as he rightly paid one year of Class 1 contributions.This should not affect his pension entitlement over a full working life. He should contact the Inland Revenue's Centre for Non-Residents at www. inlandrevenue.gov.uk/cnr. The US and Britain have reciprocal National Insurance arrangements so, when he eventually claims the state pension, he can ask for US contributions to count towards it. The time limit for claiming Class 1 NICs paid in error is within six years from the end of the year in which the contribution was paid. If the Revenue is satisfied that he had reasonable excuse for not making an application within this period, and the application was made without unreasonable delay after the excuse had ceased, the period may be extended. Applications for refunds should be made in writing to Refunds Group, Benton Park View, Longbenton, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE98 1ZZ, United Kingdom. For years where a refund of Class 1 is due, the person can ask for part of that refund to be converted to voluntary contributions. Bad news in the postcode SAGA'S RENEWAL quote for my house insurance was a bit steep so I telephoned the broker Rias (the Retirement Insurance Advisory Service) which would not quote at all because of my postcode. I live in a quiet and respectable street. I am now concerned that my house is on some kind of insurance blacklist. BG, London INSURERS can choose who they take on. Rias says only one insurer would quote on your property and that was subject to referral, meaning Rias had to agree as well. Rias refused because your postcode shows a high risk of both flooding and subsidence and it declines properties within 100 metres of a subsidence. Anyone can check their postcode on www.homecheck.co.uk and on the Environment Agency's floodline on www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood. Insurers used to decide an area's fate on the first part of the postcode, such as W12, but it can now refine this to an individual house.
