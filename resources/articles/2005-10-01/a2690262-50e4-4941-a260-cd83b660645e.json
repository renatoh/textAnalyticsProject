Joel Smith was also charged with murdering Anthony Pinnock, 41, (also known as Tony Byfield), who was believed at the time to have been Toni-Ann's father. Pinnock and Toni-Ann were shot dead in Pinnock's bedsit in Harlesden, north-west London, in September 2003. It was thought he was killed because of a drug debt and Toni-Ann was murdered so she could not identify the gunman. Two other men arrested this week in connection with the murders are on police bail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
