She\u2019s Lebanese after all and, like millions of other Arab families \u2013 especially in the diaspora \u2013 our food is an integral part of our cultural identity. But when I moved to London three-and-a-half years ago, I was hopelessly inept at cooking. I quickly realised I couldn\u2019t just live off basic meals like pasta or steak, alongside the odd takeaway or supermarket ready meal. With each passing month, I felt more disconnected from my culture, and ultimately from my family. I underestimated how much my mum\u2019s cooking gave me a sense of home. Realising this, I had my older sister send me a recipe for djaj ou riz \u2013 chicken served with rice cooked in minced lamb and ground spices \u2013 from one of her Lebanese cookbooks. When I tried to cook it the first time, I had mum on FaceTime providing me tips in real time, to make it more like her version. Mum would also ask me to switch the camera so she could see where I was up to, and watched with a huge, proud grin as I browned the mince with the spices just before adding the rice. Prior to moving to London, the only traditional dish I knew was mjuddarrah \u2013 an easy meal of rice cooked with lentils. Cooking djaj ou riz ignited a fire within me to learn more family recipes. Recipes that belonged to my grandmothers before being passed on to my mum. Recipes I probably should\u2019ve learned while still living in Sydney. Truth is, I was living at home for most of my 20s (paying most of the bills as my form of rent, mind you). I was spoilt whenever I came home from uni or work to find a delectable home-cooked meal waiting for me. So when mum came to visit me around the time of my one-year anniversary in London, I took advantage of it \u2013 and she was more than happy to give me cooking lessons. On the nights we were not eating out, I added the family recipes of fasoulia, musakhan, mansaf, knafeh, kibbeh fil souniyeh and of course hummos and baba ghanouj to my repertoire. She spent a whole unforgettable day showing me how to make what is arguably the king of all Levantine Arab dishes: waraq einab \u2013 lemony, stuffed vine leaves, slow-cooked with lamb chops and stuffed zucchini. As we stuffed and rolled vine leaves together she shared stories I already knew about her childhood in Lebanon, and reminisced about dad \u2013 who died in 2009. Our cooking lessons gave me a newfound appreciation for the labour and love mum puts into the kitchen. More than anything they deepened the bond between her and me. When I was in Sydney last year for a few months to sort out my UK visa, I learned even more recipes: maqloubeh, moukhiyeh, baklawa, kifta and kifta fil souniyeh. My confidence has grown to the point of cockiness. Sometimes I send photos to the family WhatsApp group or post on Instagram Stories just to show off \u2013 and shamelessly so. The pride in my cooking goes beyond the performative factor. It has helped me feel connected with my culture again, and to build a bridge between me and my grandmothers. While I have vague memories of my maternal grandma, my dad\u2019s mother died two years before I was born. The former left Tripoli with my grandfather in the early stages of the Lebanese civil war to be with their children already in Sydney; while the latter was a widow who fled Jaffa during Orthodox Easter of 1948, the war that led to the creation of the state of Israel, turning them into refugees. When I cook, I keenly feel the sacrifices they made for our family. Their resilience has helped to ensure food would remain a huge part of our cultural identity, and I owe it to them to honour that legacy. I also use food to connect those around me to my Palestinian and Lebanese heritage, especially my English husband. When we host friends at our place, it brings me joy to be able to cook for them. I\u2019m reminded of the generous and infectious hospitality both my mum and late dad bestowed on their guests. I\u2019m keenly aware, yet secretly proud, of the cultural idiosyncrasies I\u2019ve inherited: cooking way too much for a small dinner party and still not believing it\u2019s enough, while also encouraging guests to have more than one serving. Cooking has helped me on an emotional level. I turned to my mother\u2019s recipes whenever my mind went into overdrive from the sheer stress and uncertainty of my UK visa. While my visa situation is now under control, I still turn to cooking as a form of meditation whenever I feel anxious. My fledgling repertoire of family recipes eases the ache of homesickness whenever it washes over me. When I cook, I feel like mum is with me \u2013 even when I don\u2019t have her on FaceTime. Her warmth from the other side of the world is always felt in my kitchen, the beating heart of my home away from home. Mjuddarah Serves 2-3 Mjuddarah is a delicious vegan meal that is easy to make. My mum often describes it as a springboard recipe of sorts. Perfect this, then you can perfect other Middle Eastern dishes. Some other recipe books may include spices in mjuddarah \u2013 often cumin. My mum\u2019s recipe does not, allowing the green lentils to truly shine. If you want to increase the servings, just remember the rice/lentils ratio. That is, for every portion of rice, use 2/3 the volume of green lentils. 1 cup long grain rice, washed and drained 2/3 cup of green lentils, washed and drained 1 onion, chopped and diced 3 tablespoons of olive oil 1 teaspoon salt Place medium-size pot on high and add olive oil. Once it heats up a little, add the diced onions. Fry the onions off, until they start go brown. Add the lentils, briefly stirring them in with the onions. Add two-and-a-half cups of boiling hot water, then cover the pot with a lid. Once it starts to boil, bring the heat down to medium. Let the lentils cook for 8-10 minutes in the water. Afterwards, give it a taste for texture \u2013 the lentils need to be bitey and firm \u2013 not hard and not soft and mushy. The water should also be brown from the cooked lentils and browned onions. Once the lentils are ready, add the rice, and then the salt. Stir a couple of times to even it all out. If too much water has evaporated, and the rice is not fully submerged, add a little bit more water. Keep the pot on medium. Once the water starts to bubble, bring the stove down to low heat and give the rice and lentils one more stir to make sure nothing is starting to stick at the bottom. Once the water looks all absorbed, turn the stove off but leave the pot on the burner. Let it sit for at least 15-20 minutes. After this, the mjuddarah should be fluffy and ready to serve. Optional: Before browning the diced onions, use 2/3 cup of oil and an extra onion that has been halved and chopped sideways into slithers. Place the oil in the pot and add the onions \u2013 this may be done in two separate batches \u2013 to shallow fry. Once the onion slithers fry and go brown, remove them to drain on a paper towel. Use the same pot, with the leftover oil, to make the rest of the mjuaddah. Once the rice and lentils are ready to serve, add the fried onions on top to serve. Recommended sides: A garden salad of lettuce, cucumber, tomato and spring onion with a seasoned olive oil and fresh lemon juice dressing; or a diced cucumber and yoghurt, mint and crushed garlic salad (like a chunky tzatziki). \u2022 Elias Jahshan is an editor and freelance writer based in London.
