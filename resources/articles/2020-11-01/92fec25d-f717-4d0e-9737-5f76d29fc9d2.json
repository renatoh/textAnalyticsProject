Most supporters still do not know quite what to expect each time United run out, though their record against Sunday\u2019s opponents, Southampton, is quite impressive and a win at St Mary\u2019s would take them to within a point of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side with a game in hand. There are more pressing matters in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s in tray than catching up with the Saints, but given that Southampton are considered to have had a good start to the Premier League season while the visitors have been up and down, the United manager would be pleased to see his side back around the European positions. \u201cThe main thing for me is to keep improving, and climbing the table would be a sign of that,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cI do feel that we are getting to the right mindset after a difficult start to the season. Generally speaking, teams that are capable of winning the league are the ones that can put good runs together. I don\u2019t know if that will hold true this season because it might be a little more unpredictable than most, but we are starting to show a bit more consistency. I like the way we approach games.\u201d Part of that has been due to the impact of Bruno Fernandes, who emerged as a de facto leader on the pitch long before he was handed the armband in Paris a month ago. Though his form dipped a little towards the end of last season the midfielder has been back to his best in recent weeks, not only scoring five goals in his last three games but taking it on himself to encourage the players around him to match his high standards, sometimes even berating them if they fall short of expectations. Solskj\u00e6r is all in favour of that. \u201cIn the heat of the moment people are allowed to air their frustration and be angry for a second or two, but if it is all for the benefit of the team it is soon over and done with,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cThey are all out there fighting for one cause, after all. I want my players to take responsibility, even if it means putting others in their place at times when it\u2019s necessary. \u201cIt should never be just the managers and the coaches on the touchlines who shout. Some of the best teams I\u2019ve played in have had a system of inner justice, where things get sorted out on the pitch. If you ask me, the players have reacted really well to what Bruno has been doing. \u201cThere are different types of leaders, some players make a noise, others lead by example, some do both, but once in a while it doesn\u2019t do any harm to take a rollicking when you deserve one.\u201d United possess other players who can show leadership on the pitch, Solskj\u00e6r insists, but ever since his arrival in January Fernandes has looked both at home and in charge. \u201cBruno has had a fantastic impact, he\u2019s not afraid of anything here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just giving out rollickings, he\u2019s also instructing players. He thrives on the pressure moments and we can all learn from his mindset and winning mentality. \u201cIf we are two-nil up, he wants it to be three, if it\u2019s three goals he wants four. He\u2019s always looking for the team to improve, and that\u2019s what I want as well. We all know this is a results business and we all know we made a slow start to the season, but if we can keep improving we will end up with an opportunity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
