Her late father, who had a backyard factory making cheap furniture, believed that once his family stepped outside their house they had to be \u201cwhiter than white\u201d, the artist recalls. It was an attitude she internalised and which came to a head in 1988, Australia\u2019s bicentennial year, when \u201ceverybody was considering Australian art and culture, what the hell that is\u201d. Lee was asked to talk about her art on a panel at a Sydney College of the Arts conference. \u201cI\u2019m doing these paintings because I\u2019m declaring that I belong to the west,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cLiterally the moment that word bubble came out, I went, wait a minute,\u201d says Lee now. \u201cAnybody who has to declare that they belong, doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d Lee is now 66 and has a survey exhibition of her work, Moon in a Dew Drop, opening at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia this week. She sits on the floor of the museum\u2019s members\u2019 lounge at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay during the exhibition installation, her legs folded like Buddha, in the shikantaza or \u201cjust sitting\u201d style of the Zen meditation she has practiced for 25 years. It\u2019s an impression of calm far removed from the inner turmoil she describes having gone through in her youth. Lee paraphrases psychiatrist Carl Jung\u2019s theory that questions repressed from consciousness will return as fate. \u201cEverybody, not just [with] the race thing, will go through that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe feeling of not belonging, of being cast aside, is a horrendous state for a human being.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just her father\u2019s ideas Lee internalised, but the \u201cpainful\u201d prejudice against Asians she found in society from a young age \u2013 first as the only Chinese girl in her primary school, and then as one of only two in high school. Given she was a girl, her education \u201cdidn\u2019t really matter\u201d to her parents \u2013 they expected Lee\u2019s university education would be a mere precursor to getting married and having children; her conservative father even tried to arrange a Malaysian dentist as a potential husband, until her sister pulled their dad aside and said the match was never going to work. The \u201csilver lining\u201d of this sexism, Lee said, was that during her studies, she could quietly become an artist. In the late 1970s, Lee flew to London and studied at the Chelsea School of Art, followed by graduate school at the Sydney College of the Arts. She deliberately withheld from her parents that art was her field of study because, she says, they wouldn\u2019t have understood. \u201cI just kept lying,\u201d Lee says. In her earliest works, Lee photocopied paintings by Flemish master Jan van Eyck over and over, intensely curious about the darker and denser layers the copier added. She made wax paintings, mixing up a black oil impasto, slathering her canvases with black beeswax paste, \u201creaching back, like an archaeology of some kind\u201d. Lee went to China, seeking to connect with Chinese artists. A Shanghai curator and writer bluntly set her straight: that connection would not be possible because she had not experienced Mao\u2019s cultural revolution. Lee decided the curator was correct. \u201cI cannot imagine what it\u2019s like to wake in the morning and think, I\u2019m going to be an artist, and then be taken to a re-education camp, not to know what my life will be.\u201d Lee\u2019s parents had experienced such suffering: both sides of her family were part of the landowning class targeted by the ruling communists, and both Lee\u2019s grandmothers were imprisoned. Lee\u2019s mother married her father by arrangement, and became a black-market trader at age 17, using gold coins to bribe prison guards to free her mother-in-law. Lee eventually found her own \u201cliberation\u201d in the liminal spaces between western and Asian identities. Her genetics, ancestry and birthplace have given her \u201cphilosophical and cultural affinities\u201d that make her curious about life, and spark her creative impulses, she says. Buddhism and Daoism in particular have been central forces in her life and art since she was introduced to Zen meditation at a class in Sydney in 1995. Her 2017 photographic work The Seamless Tomb is a \u201cresponse to a koan\u201d, a Zen Buddhism form of unsolvable riddle, and is a collaboration with her husband, Rob Scott-Mitchell, a photographer and skilled printer. In The Seamless Tomb, Lee has reproduced a photograph showing her father and mother, their eldest son, and her father\u2019s brother, taken circa 1946, just as her father is about to step on a boat in China for Australia. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how my mum felt,\u201d says Lee. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t talk about it. But she is the most intrepid woman, with a certain spirit. She will always find a way through life most meaningful for her.\u201d Although never written into the legislation, in practice under the White Australia Policy there was a one-for-one swap of non-white immigrant labour. Lee\u2019s father was replacing her grandfather in Australia. It would be some time before a sympathetic immigration officer allowed her mother \u2013 then six months\u2019 pregnant with her second child \u2013 to bring their two sons to live in Sydney. Today, her mother\u2019s sense of humour is intact even though she is in care with dementia, her memory failing, and she remains Lee\u2019s \u201cenduringly\u201d biggest inspiration for her art. And their relationship is strong. Lee remembers her mother responding to the news that her daughter was going to live with a boyfriend but not get married, affectionately mimicking her mother\u2019s broken English: \u201cMum said, \u2018I no understand you, but I love you, and you OK. I have to trust you.\u2019 \u201cAnd that is an exquisite gift.\u201d \u2022 Lindy Lee: Moon in a Dew Drop is showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney until 26 April 2021"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
