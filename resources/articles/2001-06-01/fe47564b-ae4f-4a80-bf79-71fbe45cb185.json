The Islamic militant organisation told the Guardian that it would not unleash more suicide bombers on Israel so long as its troops did not kill Palestinian civilians - an undertaking that greatly increases the prospects that this fragile truce may hold and wind down the eight months of bloodshed. \"As long as the Israelis do not murder Palestinian civilians we will not attack civilians on the other side,\" Abdel Aziz Rantissi, the second most senior figure in Hamas, said yesterday. \"But if they continue to kill our kids, women, and youth, and [continue] assassinating activists, we will attack anywhere.\" The prospect of a reprieve from Hamas suicide attacks, even though it was cloaked in the usual high-blown rhetoric about continuing the struggle against the occupation, is crucial to the success of the agreement achieved by the CIA director, George Tenet. It seeks to consolidate separate ceasefire undertakings by the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. The armed wing of Hamas, Izzedin al-Qassem, is thought to have 300 members. It has claimed responsibility for all but one of the 13 suicide attacks in Israel since September. On the crumbling walls of Gaza's refugee camps, the graffiti of exploding buses tells it all: Hamas is on the march again. Yesterday's ceasefire is the unintended - by Hamas - fallout from the deadliest of its attacks, the June 1 suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv disco which killed 20 Israelis. The ceasefire terms are deeply humiliating to Mr Arafat and set him against his angry people, who have lost 500 of their own and suffered months of economic siege and agricultural destruction with no tangible gains. But Hamas says it will not bring about the immediate collapse of the truce, thus avoiding a confrontation with Mr Arafat's security forces. Its decision rests on the calculation that the ceasefire will collapse of its own accord. \"We have declared very firmly we are against any kind of clash with our brothers in the Palestinian Authority,\" Dr Rantissi said. \" It is a kind of red line no one can go through.\" In return for holding back its suicide bombers - it claims to have at least three more in the wings - Hamas seems to have extracted a promise from Mr Arafat's administration not to arrest their men, at least in the Gaza Strip. The immunity demonstrates its hold over the administration. The uprising in Gaza has been fought under a loose-knit but united command coordinating the militias of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other small armed factions in shooting and mortar attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlements. This and Hamas's popularity makes it hard for the Palestinian Authority to act against its fighters. Israel insists that Mr Arafat's police must round up at least some of the 400 militants released from its jails in the early days of the intifada, and the ceasefire is reported to call for the arrest of 20 explosives experts in the West Bank. But the Palestinian policemen are not moving against them. That means Israel is unlikely to get its hands on the most wanted Hamas bombers: Mohammed Deif, who heads the military wing in Gaza, and Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the target of the F-16 bombing raid in Nablus last month which killed 11 Palestinian policemen. Nor do Hamas's political opponents in Fatah want them jailed - especially at Israel's behest. \"What do I think of the ceasefire? It can go to hell,\" said Fayez Abu Shamala, deputy mayor of Khan Yunis, and a Fatah leader. \"What I am telling you now is the thoughts of 90% of the people who are suffering now because of the Oslo agreement signed by Mr Arafat. The tragedy now is that Fatah does not lead the people now.\" Hamas has made good use of the vacuum. An opinion poll published in April by a Palestinian academic in Jerusalem, Ghassan Khatib, found that popular support for Hamas had risen from 12% to 19% since the intifada began. It also found that 73% of Palestinians supported suicide bombings. The change of circumstance is all the more striking because Hamas had been decimated by Israeli attacks and was caught unawares by the uprising last autumn, according to Israeli intelligence reports. An Israeli security official said: \"[Hamas] are still trying to build a new infrastructure right now.\" Interactive Map of Israel The Arab-Israeli conflict - a brief history Glossary A dictionary of Israeli and Palestinian terms The issue explained The Middle East crisis Related articles 12.06.2001: Israel accepts peace plan 12.06.2001: Peace talks fall apart 12.06.2001, obituary: Ibrahim Abu-Lughod 06.06.2001: Profile: George Tenet Useful links Mitchell Report Jersualem Post Office of Israeli prime minister Peacewatch Member countries of the Arab League Palestine Times Jordan Times Israeli government Palestinian Authority"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
