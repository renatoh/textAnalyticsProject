One of them got out, punched him in the face and stomach several times, took his mobile, and drove off. \"Didn't anyone do anything?\" I asked. Like what, my daughter wanted to know. Like defending him? Shouting? Calling the police? Taking down the number plate? No. It all took place in such frightened silence that my daughter didn't even realise it was happening. \"That kind of thing happens all the time,\" she said. It was only a few months since another friend of hers, a girl, had been beaten up by a group of teenagers on a bus while the adults on board stared studiously out the windows. For this generation, growing up in London, the assumption that there is safety in numbers no longer holds true. That assumption only works if you can trust that the people around you are ready to help if you are threatened. But people appear increasingly reluctant to intervene in public places. They are scared, or indifferent, or embarrassed, or afraid of being accused of assault themselves. Nor does anyone have any confidence that, if they do intervene, they will be backed up by others. The consequence is that teenagers who aren't violent surrender meekly to any threat, in the knowledge that resistance will be useless because they are completely on their own. Joe, a gentle, streetwise 14-year-old, was with a group of girls in a busy suburban road a few months ago, in daylight, when three older males marched him to a tower block and relieved him of phone, pocket money and iPod. Joe's calculation was that if he didn't do as ordered, he would be beaten up. Appealing to passing grown-ups would be useless. Obeying was the least risky option. I listen to these stories and am aghast at our adult surrender of the public space to anyone willing to scare others. In all the discussion of antisocial behaviour, we seem to be missing an essential element. The police cannot prevent crime, intimidation or harassment. All they can hope to do is occasionally catch a perpetrator. They are meant to be the enforcers of the rules that we as a society have decided to live by - not the only upholders. If we see people being mistreated, then surely we cannot just turn away and thank God that we are not the targets. If that is what we are doing, then we are starting, literally, to become less civilised. From Hobbes onwards, we have understood that civilisation means the replacement of the power of the aggressive individual by the power of the wider group. There are obviously limits to what individuals can do. No one would advocate confronting anyone who had a knife or a gun. But there is so much lower-level violence that might be prevented if only we had a clearer sense of our mutual responsibility. Whether we have that sense seems to depend heavily on our assumptions about strangers. Some people I asked about this subject said firmly that they would never step into a public dispute. Their loyalties were only to those that they knew. Everyone else was a potential threat. Other, outwardly similar people felt equally strongly that they had an obligation to help others in distress. What seemed critical was if people had been brought up to empathise with strangers or be fearful of them. A Catholic man, for instance, said he intervened often, because his upbringing in a small northern town had taught him that strangers were only people he hadn't yet met. A diplomat's son, brought up to distrust anyone outside a narrow group, thought it his duty to his family to avoid confrontations. Not many had taken a conscious decision to act one way or another. It was largely an instinctive reaction, resulting from upbringing. Some time ago I was assaulted while sitting next to a disturbed man on a bus, who seized my arm and began to twist it. A dozen people could see what was happening. I wondered if my arm was going to be broken in front of an indifferent audience. Then a man further up began to shove his way towards us, shouting at my neighbour to let go. He did. What I was most grateful for wasn't that he rescued me from pain, but from the fear that people as a whole could not be trusted. Realising that one person's crisis can be an observer's mild entertainment is deeply dispiriting. I once turned a corner at a station to see 50 or so commuters watching a white man punch a black man senseless. Sheer outrage sent me running through the crowd; sheer surprise stopped the assailant in mid-punch. No one had called the staff or the police. A woman I know had the same shock after watching a drunk fall on to a tube line recently, just as she felt the wind of the approaching train. She and a younger woman struggled to pull him up. The 20 or 30 men nearby watched without moving a muscle. This refusal to get involved, or uphold any kind of communal values, isn't confined to threatening situations. We are just as reluctant to protest in more minor matters. We know that city-dwellers consistently list litter, noise and dog mess as major, daily irritations. But again we usually shy away from approaching anyone who is adding to the problem. What is our legitimacy? Will anyone else agree with us? Has challenging another's freedom of action become a greater taboo than chucking cans into people's gardens, or riding bikes at speed on crowded pavements? As a group, we appear utterly confused about this. But if we do nothing, we leave good behaviour entirely up to individual conscience - and as humans, it is our inclination to do just what we know we can get away with. We take our cues for appropriate behaviour from those around us, and if no one articulates social disapproval of what we do, many of us will prefer to do just as we please. As Freud pointed out, many people's consciences only develop to the extent that they fear being caught. In cities it is easy for people not to be caught, in the sense that they are unlikely to be seen by someone who knows them. As a friend said, wryly: \"I think this is particularly liberating for the middle classes.\" He has been sworn at by affluent men and women he has asked not to queue-jump or block his gates with their 4x4s. Similarly, I watched a well-dressed jogger let his enormous dog defecate on a London heath, on a hill where children run and roll. When I asked if he was picking it up, he laughed and asked what the hell it was to do with me. \"No I'm not, as a matter of fact,\" he said smugly. \"I never do.\" What would have stopped him was fear of identification. The minute I reached in my bag for a non-existent cameraphone, he took off at great speed. All of us would like to be able to indulge our desires without restriction. But it is an absolute condition of living contentedly with others that we accept some limitations on our freedom in return for everyone else doing the same. Our reluctance to act in public is leaving a dangerous vacuum. If we aren't willing to define and defend norms of behaviour, then the only constraints on bad behaviour are individual conscience on the one hand, and the law on the other. That space is too large to be left empty. Unless we are willing to do something, all of us, and not just our vulnerable children, will feel increasingly at risk. jenni.russell@blueyonder.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
