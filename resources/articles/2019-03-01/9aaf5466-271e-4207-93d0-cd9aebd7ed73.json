Scotland were only five minutes away from a first championship win at Twickenham since 1983, before George Ford\u2019s try and conversion in the last minute rescued the draw. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a recurring theme for us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019ve probably experienced this at least three times in the last 12 months, where we\u2019ve taken control of a game and let our foot off the gas and been unable to get control of it back.\u201d On the tour to South Africa last summer England started the first two Tests playing the rugby of the gods, only to collapse to defeat each time. In the Six Nations superb starts against France and, most tellingly, Wales were not maintained \u2013 and now the 38-38 draw with Scotland. \u201cIt is 100% mental. There\u2019s no physical difference out there at all. It\u2019s 100% the way you think. And we\u2019ll get that right. We\u2019ve got good time before the World Cup. These are possibly things the team have had for a long time, even before I\u2019ve had them. So we need to make sure we get the right people in to help us and we\u2019ll sort it out. It\u2019s a lesson. \u201cThe hardest lessons are the best lessons. You want them before you go to a World Cup. If you do that in a pool game against Tonga, for instance, you can find yourself in a difficult situation. We\u2019d rather have those lessons now and we\u2019ll do everything we can to learn from them and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Owen Farrell was in agreement and the captain did not shy away from taking his share of the blame, having been charged down for Scotland\u2019s first try, intercepted for their fifth, the equaliser, and nearly cost England with another controversial challenge in the final quarter. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely mental,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe saw in the first 20 minutes or so how good we were physically. I think when they did come back and got that momentum shift it probably shocked us that bit too much. We probably gifted them the momentum swing, me more than anyone.\u201d Scotland retain the Calcutta Cup for the first time in 35 years but this has been a disappointing championship for them, notwithstanding their injury crisis. \u201cWe need to be pretty honest about our Six Nations in general,\u201d said Stuart McInally, their captain. \u201cBut we\u2019ve done something we haven\u2019t in a long time by retaining the Calcutta Cup.\u201d Gregor Townsend, Scotland\u2019s coach, described the game as unlike any he has known. \u201cThat was a unique game. I\u2019ve never been involved in one like that as a player or coach. There are not many games of rugby that go from 31-0 to 31-38, then end up at 38-all. It\u2019s the most unusual game I\u2019ve been involved in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
