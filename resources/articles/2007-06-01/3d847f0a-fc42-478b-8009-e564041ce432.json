By this time next year it will look more like its old self and by the 2009 Championships work is scheduled to have been completed on the sliding roof, which will bring it into the 21st century. In the meantime, anyone arriving at Wimbledon expecting to see the dark, intimate surroundings so beloved of champions and spectators alike is in for a shock and that includes those who are likely to play on it in the next fortnight. The most obvious change is that the sloping awnings that covered the crowd have gone, leaving the whole place open-topped and exposed to the elements. Tim Henman, who is pencilled in to play his first-round match against Carlos Moy\u00e1 on Centre Court today, has already had a look at the place where so many of his dreams have been created and crushed, and he did not like what he saw. \"I probably fall into the category of someone who doesn't like change,\" said Henman, surprising nobody with his admission of conservatism. \"Looking at it now, it does seem very different and less intimate, something which appealed to me. It's obviously going through major change so I'll be happy when it's back to the way it was.\" Wimbledon's defending champions were just as divided as its British representatives. Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said yesterday that she would reserve judgment until she played on it. \"It really is a little bit different and not as closed as it used to be,\" the Frenchwoman said. \"Maybe it could change a little bit the conditions of play. I guess it could be a little bit windier. We'll have to see in the next couple days how players feel about it. But it's just a step for this year. I guess everything is going to come back the way it should be for 2008.\" Roger Federer is scheduled to begin his bid for a fifth consecutive title at 1pm today, as is customary for the reigning men's champion. He was bracing himself for a different look and feel to his favourite court. \"You feel it's in a transition period,\" he said. \"I think it looks bigger, it's brighter, it's better for the greenkeeper with the grass getting more sun. It definitely looks bigger as, before, 30% of the crowd were in the shadows. I think it's going to be OK.\" Serena Williams, a two-time Wimbledon champion, should probably have the last word, if only because her take on Centre Court's facelift was perhaps the most sensible. \"I grew up on some pretty tough courts,\" the American said. \"This is splendid compared to where I come from.\" What else is new? Hawk-Eye Following its successful implementation at the 2006 US Open and the 2007 Australian Open, Hawk-Eye comes to SW19 for the first time this year. The electronic line-calling system will be used on Centre Court and Court One, replacing Cyclops on the service line, with players entitled to three \"incorrect\" challenges as opposed to two at Flushing Meadows and in Melbourne. If a set goes to a tie-break an additional challenge will be granted to each player or doubles pair regardless of how many they have used that set, but challenges cannot be carried over into the next set. If the match is tied at 6-6 in the deciding set, both players or teams again have a limit of up to three incorrect challenges in the next 12 games. A challenge of a line call or overrule will be allowed only on either a point-ending shot or when a player/team stops playing the point during a rally. The chair umpire may request an electronic review when a line umpire was unsighted on a point-ending shot and he/she is unable to make a decision. In all circumstances Hawk-Eye's verdict is final and cannot be appealed. Equal prize money Wimbledon will join each of the other three grand slams in offering its male and female champions the same cash prize, and the US and Australian Opens in paying equal money across the board - from the champions down to the first-round losers in all events. The winners will receive \u00a3700,000 each from a purse of \u00a311,282,710 - an 8.7% increase on the 2006 prize fund. The men's champion will receive 6.9% more than last year, while the women's title-winner will take home a 12% increase. David Ornstein"}, "isHosted": false}}}
