When Fulham beat them 2-1 in October Blackburn were 15th and struggling; since then they have lost twice and are surging inexorably upwards. So pleased is Graeme Souness, whose managerial career seemed close to ruin not so long ago, with this personal and professional change of fortune that he is busy handing second chances to, it seems, anyone who comes to his attention. On Saturday the marauding wing-play of Damien Duff was mirrored on the right by Keith Gillespie, who was starting his first game at home in more than 11 months. He might have considered his original exclusion somewhat harsh as his last match, against Sheffield United, was won 5-0. But consider the case of Eyal Berkovic, who completed 90 minutes for the first time since August - when he scored a hat-trick in Celtic's 7-0 win over Jeunesse Esch. \"It's an amazing turn-around,\" Gillespie said - of himself, rather than his team. \"I never thought I'd play for this club again and I was as amazed as anyone when the manager called me in and said he'd give me a second chance. It was just a case of working hard and hoping something happens.\" A loan spell at Wigan made little difference and another month on the sidelines followed before his recent return. \"It was difficult. I've been used to first-team football for all my career so those four months were tough, but I've worked hard in training and seem to be getting the reward. \"But it's not easy when you've been out for as long as I have. Fortunately I've joined a winning side, my fitness is getting better with every game but a lot of the time you get by on sheer adrenalin.\" It is a similar story with Berkovic, who may have been sidelined at Celtic but remains a bright, perceptive presence in midfield. It was he who finally broke down an organised if uninspired West Brom, exchanging passes with David Dunn and cutting back to the unmarked Marcus Bent. A permanent move would probably suit both player and club. \"I don't think about Celtic any more, just Blackburn,\" he says. \"When I came I said we need to get out very quick from this division, and I think it will be easier playing in the Premiership because it is more quality.\" Sven-Goran Eriksson is not the only international coach doing the rounds of league grounds. Berkovic's performance was watched by the Israel coach Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen, another Scandinavian verbally brandishing a diploma in diplomacy. \"I was very pleased with what I saw,\" he said, \"and of course I wish Blackburn all the best of luck about the promotion.\" They may not need it. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
