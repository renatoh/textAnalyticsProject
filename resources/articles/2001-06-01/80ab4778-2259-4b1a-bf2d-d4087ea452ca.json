Tomorrow Barcelona play their final league game of the season at home to Valencia needing victory to beat their opponents to fourth position in La Liga and a place in next season's Champions League. Arsenal will, with all due respect, be hoping they draw or lose. That would give the north London club more chance of signing Sol Campbell who insists that his new employers must be playing in Europe's top club competition next season. Should Barcelona win then Campbell will have a harder choice to make between the two clubs understood to be on his shortlist. Arsenal have been holding talks with the former Tottenham defender, sparking speculation that the transfer has been agreed. But Arsene Wenger maintains the deal is not done yet. \"Of course we are still interested in Sol Campbell,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"But I don't think he has made his mind up about where he wants to go. \"It's his decision where he goes and people should ask him if they want to know. We have not agreed anything and at the moment it is all just speculation.\" Chelsea's interest in the end of Barcelona's season stems from their interest in the former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit, whom they want to team up with new \u00a311m acquisition Frank Lampard. On Wednesday Barcelona play the first leg of the Spanish Cup semi-final against Celta Vigo with the second leg next Sunday. If they win that, the final is not until June 30. Only when Barcelona finish their season will Chelsea be able to resume talks over the likely \u00a36.5m transfer of Petit to Stamford Bridge. As Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson confirmed: \"It's true we have had discussions with Barcelona and they have said that they do not want to continue those talks until the end of the season.\" La Liga (Top 10) P W D L GD Pts Real Madrid 37 23 8 6 40 77 Deportivo 37 21 7 9 25 70 Real Mallorca 37 19 11 7 16 68 Valencia 37 18 9 10 22 63 Barcelona 37 16 12 9 22 60 Celta Vigo 37 16 10 11 2 58 Malaga 37 16 8 13 3 56 Villarreal 37 15 9 13 2 54 Espanyol 37 14 8 15 6 50 Alaves 37 14 7 16 0 49"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
