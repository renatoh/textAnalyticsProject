That may seem like a ridiculous question. The playpen of Hitchcock, Scorsese, Lynch. That mecca of talent and resources. But Hollywood is also powered by multinational corporations who view showbusiness as precisely that: a business. Producers are notorious for tempering creative visions and burning through talent, from the in/out revolving door nature of American celebrity to the \u201cour way or the highway\u201d attitude of the top brass, which has always been part of Hollywood\u2019s make-or-break fabric. For any director who wants to argue with Harvey Weinstein about keeping that final shot zooming in on a puddle of water or an ending that ruminates on the existential qualities of the human condition \u2013 well, good luck. The government-subsidised Australian film industry doesn\u2019t have that same commercially driven impetus; in fact, a locally-made hit at the box office often takes the Australian public by surprise. Our film-makers are afforded freedoms associated with two words that are common here but as rare as four-leaf clovers in America: final cut. The incentives for Australia\u2019s best and brightest emerging film-makers to ship off overseas are, of course, greater opportunities and resources. Justin Kurzel went from debuting his feature film career with the 2011 low-budget South Australia-set thriller Snowtown to directing Michael Fassbender in a spectacular soon-to-be-released adaptation of Macbeth. Next, he will take on the film adaptation of blockbuster video game Assassin\u2019s Creed. After turning heads with her stunning but (in Australia at least) under-appreciated psychological creepy-crawly The Babadook, Warner Brothers flew writer-director Jennifer Kent to the US to discuss various high-profile projects. She would ultimately choose a less Hollywood, more artistic path. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself in the tentpole arena,\u201d Kent has said, but American agencies nevertheless swarmed. In the current climate, the expectation is that first-time Australian feature film-makers who make a creative splash will bag a one-way ticket to Los Angeles if given the chance. This has been going on for so long, it feels like a natural trajectory: one or maybe two Aussie films in the bag, then on to bigger and better things. But it wasn\u2019t always like this. During the 1970s, when Australian cinema experienced a great renaissance and produced a wellspring of fresh talent widely regarded as some of our finest film-makers, these artists generally stuck around. They made multiple films. They developed their craft. They were (to a point) allowed to take risks and allowed to fail. Nowadays the expectation is the first-time feature films shouldn\u2019t be average or good; they should be great. \u201cAustralians are notoriously recalcitrant when it comes to seeing Australian films,\u201d David Mich\u00f4d, writer-director of Animal Kingdom, said in a 2010 interview. \u201cThey need to be told not just that the film is good, but that it is exceptional.\u201d The catch is that the better their first-time films are, the more we expect to wave goodbye after overseas investors pounce. Three of the biggest names at the heart of the 70s film renaissance \u2013 Peter Weir, Bruce Beresford and Phillip Noyce \u2013 stayed in Australia working as feature film-makers for more than a decade before moving overseas. They had little reason to leave. They were afforded creative freedom, reasonably sized budgets, ongoing work and big audiences. The decline over the years in box office market share of locally produced features (down from 23% in the 80s to less than 5% in recent years) has certainly played a factor in why our emerging film-makers tend to leave the country post-haste. The Australian film industry should do more to encourage them to stay. If a director\u2019s first feature doesn\u2019t sell well at the box office (although bums on seats is not the only yardstick by which we ought to gauge success), there\u2019s every chance their subsequent features will. Like any other craft, film-making is something people generally get better at with time. It is reasonable to suggest a growing audience will be part of that improvement, in turn benefiting the wider industry in financial and other ways, such as skills-sharing and mentoring. Sweetie, the first feature film of Australian-based director Jane Campion, was not a commercial success (it took $367,000 during its theatrical run). But her follow-up film, 1993\u2019s The Piano (a co-production with France and New Zealand) was a monster hit, pocketing over $140m at the international box office. Campion became the second of four women ever nominated for the Academy award for best director and the first female film-maker in history to receive Cannes\u2019 prestigious Palme d\u2019Or. The fact that so many of Australia\u2019s emerging film-makers leave the country in ways they didn\u2019t in the 1970s would provide the mother of all wake-up calls, were it not for the Australian film industry\u2019s remarkable ability to generate new talent. In 2014, we saw some strong feature film directorial debuts from no less than Russell Crowe with The Water Diviner,and Tony Mahony and Angus Sampson\u2019s The Mule, and two outstanding ones: The Babadook and ingenious time-travel romp The Infinite Man, from Adelaide-based writer-director Hugh Sullivan. So far in 2015 there have been two excellent narrative feature debuts, with Simon Stone\u2019s extraordinarily assured The Daughter and Brendan Cowell\u2019s Ruben Guthrie. And we\u2019ve had at least three impressive feature-length documentary debuts: Jennifer Peedom with the awe-inspiring Sherpa (she had previously co-directed a 58-minute film with David Mich\u00f4d), Richard Todd\u2019s electrifying Frackman and Damon Gameau with That Sugar Film. This kind of growth is exciting but bittersweet given some of this year\u2019s batch of first-time film-makers will have their eyes on the exit. But if history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the talent pool won\u2019t be drying up any time soon. Guardian Australia\u2019s Film Club will screen David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s Animal Kingdom and feature a panel discussion with producers Liz Watts (Animal Kingdom), Kath Shelper (Ruben Guthrie) and Tristan Roache-Turner (Wyrmwood). The event starts at 2pm on 19 July at Sydney\u2019s Palace Verona in Paddington and will be hosted by Luke Buckmaster.
