The home side, all selfless worth ethic, showed precisely why they have become such respected Premier League opponents. Roy Hodgson has worked with a regular line-up and has proved what can be achieved with solid, sensible coaching. The team may appear unambitious at times but they have substance, even if they did finally crack, and they understand each other's strengths. They have a huge work-rate, and benefit from a good, simple shape (4\u20134\u20132) and a clear understanding of their distinct roles, particularly when their opponents have the ball. Liverpool took over the first half and pounded the Fulham goal, yet they only created two chances where the visiting player was freed beyond the last man: first after Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres's superb inter-passing put the Spaniard away; then when a wonderful Gerrard cross gave Andrea Dossena a clear invitation. Credit must go to Fulham for the way they organised. Brede Hangeland and Aaron Hughes know their strengths and refused to get pulled out to the flanks. The full-backs, John Pantsil and Paul Konchesky, are disciplined and restrained. In front of them there is protection by Simon Davies and Clint Dempsey, who graft with amazing energy to position themselves and prevent the opposition finding space in which they could attack down the wing. With Danny Murphy alongside the strong Dickson Etuhu, Fulham effectively fling down an eight-man barrier. It takes a team with good movement and continual overloading of numbers to create chances, and Liverpool were in exciting form. Perhaps most admirable of all is that Fulham's early defensive shape stems from the calm movements by their first line of defence, the two strikers. Bobby Zamora and Andy Johnson immediately retreated whenever Liverpool had the ball at the back (see diagram) and never chased lost causes or made irresponsible runs or reckless early challenges. They dropped off centrally between the opposition centre-backs and full-backs, and didn't race early to close. Charge in and they would have run the risk of an opposing full-back advancing down the flank, which would have the effect of pulling Fulham players out of position. But, with their forwards dropping back, Dempsey and Davies know they can sit in front of their full-backs rather than having to pressure an opponent who has forced beyond Zamora or Johnson. There were no holes for Liverpool to exploit, and the home side never lost their shape. Hodgson has coached an average group of Premier League parts into a solid machine. His next trick has to be to coax extra flair whilst maintaining such defensive resolution. It is a conundrum Roy will juggle. Here they finally succumbed to aggressive Liverpool movement, but there was much to admire from his team in defeat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
