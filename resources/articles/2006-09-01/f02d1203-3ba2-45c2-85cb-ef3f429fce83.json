Four years on the view looks rather different. On Tuesday the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, backed a new study to determine how much America is losing out as a result of the stringent Sarbox audit rules, which include a demand that chief executives personally declare their annual figures to be true. Mr Paulson fears US public markets are losing out to foreign rivals and private markets, ie that companies prefer to list on non-US markets or move into private hands rather than play by US rules. Only yesterday, the UK vaccines group Acambis said it was to pull its US listing as a result of Sarbox. Other UK corporates with US listings question the costs of compliance. One FTSE 100 chief executive recently told the Guardian that its annual Sarbox bill was \u00a320m. From this side of the pond the results look pretty clear. The London Stock Exchange has seen a flood of new companies joining the market that otherwise might have preferred Wall St, such as the vast Rosneft and Kazakhmys and the 36 Chinese companies now listed on Aim. Twice as much foreign equity is now traded in London as in the US. Little wonder then that the very real possibility of a takeover of the LSE by its 25% shareholder Nasdaq has caused so many furrowed brows in the City. Those doing the complaining are not so much concerned with saving the LSE for the nation, much more about whether US regulations will be imported to the UK by the back door as a result. Yesterday the economic secretary, Ed Balls, took action. New legislation is to be introduced to allow the Financial Services Authority, which regulates the LSE, to veto \"disproportionate\" rules. In other words, if Sarbox loomed, the FSA would have the power to stamp on it. While details are still scant, Mr Balls looks to have found a neat solution for those in the City and among UK firms who feared either draconian new demands or an abrupt halt to the tide of high fee-earning listings that Sarbox has sent London's way. Statistical error There is no surprise that the head of the Office for National Statistics has fired off a letter to the cabinet secretary, Gus O'Donnell, grumbling about Tony Blair blurting out yesterday's unemployment figures to the TUC on Tuesday. He made a mockery of the government's claim that the ONS is at arm's length and operationally independent. If that were really the case, senior ministers would have to wait with the rest of us to see market-moving economic data. Karen Dunnell complained to Mr O'Donnell - himself an economist aware of how sensitive financial markets are to economic data - that Mr Blair's action contravened the National Statistics code of practice and asked him to hammer the point home at No 10. Behind the scenes, she will now be keen to cease the practice of politicians getting their hands on this stuff ahead of time. Breaking the code There are many in the City - mostly pointy-headed technical chart analysts - whose daily toil involves looking for patterns in market prices and forecasting future movements. They employ hundreds of different methods including many fanciful theories that academics class alongside astrology. Among the most popular of these is the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers - for those unacquainted with The Da Vinci Code - formed by adding two numbers to obtain the next in the sequence: eg 1,1,2,3,5,8,13, 21, 34 ... and so on to infinity. It is the work of the 13th-century mathematician Leonardo 'Fibonacci' da Pisa, whose Book of Calculation, penned in 1202, helped popularise (if that is the correct word) algebra. As the numbers in his sequence get larger, the ratio of each number to its preceding number converges to 1.618, or the so-called \"golden ratio\". It is this ratio that gets the highly remunerated pointy-heads excited. They mix it up with Elliott Wave Theory (don't ask) and, hey presto, think they can predict market movements. Now, though, we have hard evidence that this is a totally rubbish theory. Professor Roy Batchelor, professor of banking and finance at Cass Business School, has studied all the daily price movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1914 to 2002 and found no greater evidence of the golden ratio at work than would happen by chance. The Fibonacci rule, he concludes, is \"just an illusion ... wishful thinking ... a mirage\", which like The Da Vinci Code should be confined to holiday reading. So will the nonsense now stop? No chance, he says, because the chart community needs every possible straw to grasp at - even if it is utter cobblers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
