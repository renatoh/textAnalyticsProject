City are at home to Wolves on Monday evening with the champions unlikely to strengthen in defensive midfield despite Guardiola\u2019s wish to add a second specialist in the position. Although Fernandinho will be 34 by the end of the season Guardiola said City do not currently have the finance to buy a replacement. When put to him that Neves might be the type required Guardiola said: \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent player but there are many clubs in the world, many holding midfielders in the world, and most of them can play here. That\u2019s not the point. \u201cMost of them are under contracts. A month ago, I started reading \u2013 \u2018R\u00faben Neves, \u00a3100m\u2019. That is not going to happen, we are not going to pay \u00a3100m for a holding midfielder. Of course, in all departments in the club, we have in every position four or five or six options \u2013 depending on age, what we believe and, of course, the price. \u201cThe most expensive one was Riyhad [Mahrez, \u00a360m last summer] and he earns far away from what the top teams pay. Our wage bill for the players is eighth or ninth or 10th in Europe, so there are eight or nine clubs where the wages are higher than Manchester City pay. \u201cWe try to be stable in everything. When we spent a lot [two summers ago] \u2013 it was because the team was old \u2013 it was an average 30-31 years old and that\u2019s why we did it. But we cannot do it every season. We have a limit and cannot spend more so that\u2019s why we need to be careful with the players and try next season to see what we can do to improve.\u201d Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, who often deputises for Fernandinho, has a contract that expires in 18 months\u2019 time. \u201cHe knows what we want [regarding his long-term future] \u2013 it\u2019s in our hands. \u201cG\u00fcndogan played the last two games like a holding midfielder [against Rotherham United and Burton Albion], he had more space than usual \u2013 but he was so clever. He made an incredible assist and a lot of passes before the finish. His quality is incredible, we knew that. \u201cUnfortunately, the first season he had a long injury, like [Benjamin] Mendy last season \u2013 and when he\u2019s fit, he\u2019s an incredible player. He can play that holding midfield role, he has the quality and the vision to pass. When he\u2019s close to the box, he arrives in the right tempo and the right moment to score a goal. He\u2019s a fantastic player.\u201d Kevin De Bruyne appeared to walk straight down the tunnel when being substituted after 67 minutes against Burton in the 9-0 Carabao Cup win, Guardiola doing so to protect him following his latest injury. The manager shrugged off the question of whether De Bruyne had a problem with the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, he didn\u2019t speak to me, so I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIf he has a problem he knows where I am, so I don\u2019t know, really. I didn\u2019t speak with him so that one time I cannot say what he thinks because I don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
