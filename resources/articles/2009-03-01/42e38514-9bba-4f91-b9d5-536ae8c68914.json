It was precisely midway through the 11th session of the 15 scheduled for this final Test when Graeme Swann rapped Lionel Baker on the front pad, appealed and saw Daryl Harper's finger upraised. It was referred, of course, and might have been overturned (tailenders have always caught the rough end it seems) but off they all trooped. West Indies, after two balls short of 179 overs were out for 544. It gave them a first-innings deficit of two and, with the sides effectively back where they started on Friday morning, several thousand in Queen's Park Oval, if they had not already done so, lost the will to live. England were left 18 overs to bat in the second innings, which, with the onus totally on them to make one last effort to steal the game, they went at with gusto. In so doing it allowed West Indies a small initial toe-hold into a batting line-up weakened for this match. Inside four overs they had lost Andrew Strauss to Chris Gayle, who batted with a runner and then bowled the third over, without a runner, presumably because he does not actually run, and Owais Shah, caught at the wicket having a wipe. By the close, at 80 for three, Alastair Cook had gone as well. Kevin Pietersen (34) and Paul Collingwood (1) have some work to do this morning. There was an optimism in England's late effort, but, unless West Indies choke massively, and there have been no signs of that this series, it ought to prove a false one. The home side are holding all the cards, for in taking their first innings deep into the penultimate day, the primary object when selecting their side, West Indies have all but guaranteed that the series will be theirs, and the Wisden Trophy, relinquished at the turn of the millennium, will be theirs once more. To win, England need time, say two sessions minimum, and that has to be irrespective of runs. If they set a challenging target, West Indies will just not bother and bat out time. If, instead, they offer them something less strenuous, still they will set out to bat out time. England will have to expect to take 10 wickets rather than be donated them in a run chase. England wanted quick wickets first thing to have a sniff of a chance of turning things around and controlling the match themselves. Instead, they saw the runs increase relentlessly as Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Brendan Nash took their partnership to 234, an all-comers Test record for the fifth wicket on this ground. Nash was out to his first ball after lunch, but by then this worthy cricketer had reached 109, the first century of his brief but tenacious Test career. This was tailor-made for Chanderpaul, however, a player who might sell his soul at the crossroads for the chance to bat for eternity. On he went, not entirely comfortable at times, especially when facing a brilliant but luckless spell of sustained old-ball bowling from James Anderson, but never flustered, until by the time the innings ended he had reached 147, the 21st hundred of his long and distinguished career. It was the sixth century of this match and the 16th, and probably not the last, of the series, the count standing at eight apiece between the sides. The dominance of bat over ball since England capitulated in that bizarre but ultimately decisive session in Jamaica that handed the first Test to West Indies, has been astounding, the two sides virtually batting themselves into a stupor. The pitches have got more batsman-friendly as the series has progressed, the bowlers wondering what they had done to deserve such a spell in purgatory. Yet flat is a relative term. A team that drops catches is going to find the going tougher and both teams have been guilty \u2013 England here, West Indies in Bridgetown when with competent copping they might have dismissed England for 350 instead of conceding 600. In this West Indies innings, England missed a total of seven chances, not all of them costly, but each one symptomatic. Of those that had an impact, the one by Strauss to reprieve Nash when he had 24, and that by Prior, who dropped Chanderpaul first thing yesterday off Swann when 57, were costliest, the latter at a time when it was vital to make early inroads. It added to a trying game for Prior, with his century offset by the concession of 34 byes \u2013 three short of the 75-year-old record held by Frank Woolley but wrongly attributed to Les Ames \u2013 as part of a mammoth 74 extras, itself two short of the record for a Test innings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
