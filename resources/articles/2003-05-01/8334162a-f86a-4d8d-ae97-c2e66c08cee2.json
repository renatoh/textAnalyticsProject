Yes, for possibly the first time in your life, you will be free to flit about in the cool night air, from student union to discotheque to dubious kebab van, entirely without your coat and your pocket handkerchief. Your mother will never even know. University is famed for its social life - indeed it is one of the things that many prospective students most look forward to about leaving home. There'll not only be the usual array of pubs and clubs to visit, but also a host of university societies and events to keep you gloriously entertained well into the wee small hours. Some universities are famed for their stunning social opportunities, and the ready supply of cheap, strong booze. But is a particular city's reputation for its brimming nightlife important enough to influence where you choose to apply? Though only a fool would base their entire decision on a city's proliferation of \"nitespots\", it is actually something to consider. You may not be the sort of person who would thrive in a small-town environment with, admittedly, plenty of pubs and real ale, but where the underground hip hop scene is just one weasely bloke with a Kriss Kross record. Alternatively, you may not relish the sort of university lifestyle that revolves around cheap cocktails and foam parties, when you'd rather be enjoying a glass of sweet sherry and some scintillating conversation. Ultimately, your priority should be your course, but your studies will suffer if you aren't happy with the rest of your life. Choosing your university isn't just about sniffing out the best biological sciences degree course in the country, it's also about finding a place you'll feel happy living for the next three or four years. And part of this will depend on your social life. Wherever you go, getting the right balance between work and play is pretty difficult. You may feel initially anxious about the huge pile of reading you have to wade through, and this, coupled with the rather daunting prospect of making an entirely new set of compadres, may result in you sitting in your room every night, listening to Smiths records and weeping. Bear in mind, however, that everybody needs a bit of time off to enjoy themselves. Perversely, your work will probably improve if you aren't slogging away at the coal-face 24 hours a day. If you're having trouble meeting new people, perhaps you might consider joining a university club or society - sooner or later you're bound to stumble across some like-minded souls. At the other end of the scale, don't let your new-found freedom lead you to neglect your studies. If you're out at three-legged cider-drinking contests every night of the week, your work will suffer. It's nigh-on pointless trotting out those government guidelines about the recom mended number of units of alcohol (though it's 21 for the gentlemen and 14 for the ladies, in case you're interested) because you're bound to drink to excess at university. It's just one of the vaguely rebellious things you do when you're young and believe yourself to be invincible, like not taking your multivitamin, or spurning a proper dinner in favour of a bowl of Frosties. But as a general rule, if you're drinking to what one might term a professional level every day, or indeed if alcohol is rapidly becoming one of your major food groups, it's maybe time to cut down a smidgen. Nobody wants to be known as the soak who has to be rolled home from the bar every night, and furthermore, existing in a perpetual state of soggy-headedness can mean that you begin to neglect other areas of your life: your work, for example, or your relationships. Or indeed you may just begin to reek of cheap port and your own vomit, and find yourself suddenly unable to answer any of the questions on Fifteen to One. They are all causes for concern. You are at university to expand your mind - a fact which many students jovially cite as validation of their use of certain illegal substances. Now, we're not going to tell you not to do drugs; that's a job for your parents. And the police. And the Daily Mail. What we will say is don't be daft about it. Like alcohol, drugs shouldn't prop up your whole life. Don't ever feel that taking drugs is compulsory, even if the other kids do call you a \"loser\" or a \"square\" or whatever insults the young people are flinging about nowadays. Perhaps point out that by abstaining you are generously allowing them to enjoy more of their wacky backy/nose candy/disco biscuits. And, if you suspect you may be becoming dependent on drugs or alcohol, or Double Deckers, contact someone, such as the university counselling service, who can help. Finally, for every student, there are mornings that never should be. After a heavy night of sangria, alcopops and dancing on a tabletop with a bottle of dessert wine in your sweaty paw, you're going to need more than a stiff cup of Nescafe to get you fettled in time for your tutorial. May we recommend to all prospective students that they keep an emergency king-size packet of chocolate digestives and a box of heavy-duty painkillers in their top drawer. And a bucket - always best to have one poised and ready for action beside your bed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
