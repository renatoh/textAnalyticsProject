When the self-styled Dr Funkenstein hits a stage with his longtime enablers the P-Funk Allstars, he intends to grow older on it. A midnight curfew means this concert is relatively short. But your reporter still flags long before he does. It is almost immaterial whether Clinton's \"cosmic slop\" is relevant any more. In fact it hasn't really been since the early-1980s creative surge that produced the much-sampled Atomic Dog. Perhaps his main function now is to argue that late- middle-aged pop stars needn't lapse into a McCartneyesque retirement filled with good causes. Indeed, advancing years have given Clinton licence to indulge in ever more rascally behaviour, as when he stands centre-stage intoning,\"Smack that ass\", accompanied by gestures and leers. When he finally trundled on stage, unusually tasteful in African robes with multicoloured dreadlocks sprouting from the back of his head, the other 14 P-Funkers had already been on stage for a good hour. They are worth turning up for in themselves if only to see veteran guitarist Starchild go through his paces in an adult-sized nappy. But, fluidly shambolic as they are, they're just paving the way for the big man. The temperature rises when Clinton arrives, every inch the funk patriarch. Flanked by Starchild and singer Sheila Brody, one of the original 1970s Brides of Funkenstein, he busks his way through an improvised blues number, rumbling like Louis Armstrong. Pipes cleared, he harrumphs into one of the all-time anthems, Give Up the Funk, which moves at a stately, trumpet-blatting pace for almost half an hour. Brody and the baby-voiced Belita Woods do much of the work, while Clinton merely encourages us to shout \"Booty!\". But such is his weird charisma that he could spend 15 minutes growling, \"Tail ain't nothing but a booty, booty ain't nothing but a butt\" (which he does, a few songs later) and still be worth every penny.
