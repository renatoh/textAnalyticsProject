Luka Modric, 2011", "bodyText": "Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) Yes \u2013 this is a clear trick to circumvent the law. He may not have handled the ball directly, but doing it indirectly like this is still an offence: his shirt effectively becomes an extension of his hands if he's using it to trap the ball. Show him a yellow card for unsporting behaviour and restart play with a direct free-kick to the opposition. Thanks to Dan Fleming for this question. 2) Award a dropped ball on the six-yard line parallel to the goalline at the point nearest to where the keeper was standing. The laser has totally distracted the keeper \u2013 it's the same as if he'd been hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Before restarting, talk to the security at the ground and arrange for an announcement to be made warning fans not to use laser pens. After the game, report what happened to the authorities. All this fan has succeeded in doing is costing his side a goal. Ben Culling wins the shirt. 3) There are rules about players lifting shirts to display slogans, but it'd be stretching them a bit to punish this player for his celebration. What you need to consider is whether his celebration was excessive and so delayed the restart. If it did, show him a yellow card. Thanks to Joe Gibson.
