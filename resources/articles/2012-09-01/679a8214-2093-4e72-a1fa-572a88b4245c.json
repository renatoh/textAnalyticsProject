As shoppers increasingly prefer to buy online some retailers' attachment to top line volume growth rather than the quality of income generated could put their survival at risk. The number of retailers falling into administration in the first three months of the year climbed by 15% to 69 from 60 in the same period last year. Deloitte estimates that online sales account for the equivalent of more than 60m square feet of retail space. This is set to increase further and could render large amounts of shop space obsolete. The firm predicted in March that up to four out of 10 shops would have to shut in the next five years. The ones that remain will have to adapt to suit customers' changing habits. Retail experts believe the high street will change beyond recognition, and be lined with coffee shops and internet kiosks. Hugo Clark, director in Deloitte's real estate team and author of the report, says: \"The death of the high street is far from being a reality, yet stores are now just one part of a larger, more connected customer experience. Shops now represent a potentially clumsy, fixed point in an increasingly mobile world. In many cases, they are slow and costly to adapt, expensive to operate and difficult to relinquish once surplus to requirements.\" The challenge for retailers is to ensure the process of shutting shops is part of a coherent strategy. This must be based on a clear vision of what the ideal footprint should look like, rather than simply cutting stores as and when leases expire. Clark said: \"Reducing portfolios is not easy. Inflexible lease structures in particular mean that a decision to downsize store portfolios can take a considerable length of time to implement cost-effectively. The mistake that many retailers make is waiting until the eleventh hour, when cash to support lease surrenders is not available. \"Well funded businesses should consider investing spare cash into negotiating surrenders of their poorest performing stores. While this is unlikely to be cheap, it may prove to be a good long term investment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
