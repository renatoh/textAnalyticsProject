Carrick moved to Old Trafford from Tottenham Hotspur in 2006 and is now the club\u2019s longest-serving player following Wayne Rooney\u2019s departure to Everton. Lukaku, meanwhile, played his first game for United in a 5-2 win against LA Galaxy in Carson City on Saturday, the opening game of a five-match pre-season tour. Lukaku, who joined from Everton for \u00a375m, failed to score but appeared to settle instantly \u2013 though Carrick was quick to emphasise the pressure that comes with playing for the 20-times English champions. \u201cThe jump is massive,\u201d Carrick said. \u201cI found that myself coming from Tottenham. It\u2019s a massive jump. You can\u2019t really explain to people until they\u2019ve gone through it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find the same. But having Premier League experience is a massive bonus. He\u2019ll know how things work week to week. It\u2019s just about dealing with the pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s early days. It\u2019s one week\u2019s training and 45 minutes against Galaxy so you can\u2019t come to any conclusions. We know what he is all about, there are no surprises. We all know exactly what he brings and that is why he is here. He is not going to change his game because he has come here. He does what he does best and obviously he\u2019s been brought here to score goals. I am pretty certain he will do that this season.\u201d Lukaku has 85 Premier League goals since 2012, second only to Sergio Ag\u00fcero, and is the main replacement for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored 28 goals for United last season. Carrick was reluctant to draw parallels between the two players. \u201cIbra was terrific for us but Rom is his own man. When I came it was Roy Keane who came up [in comparison] but I\u2019m my own man. Whoever comes in, you\u2019re always your own man. I don\u2019t want to compare them at all because it\u2019s not fair to do that. \u201cHe\u2019ll be judged like anyone else: on what he does through the season and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s ready for that. The scrutiny will go up a level from what he\u2019s used to. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s prepared for that and I\u2019m sure he will do well.\u201d Carrick is adamant United have to challenge for the league title next term. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to feel that. It\u2019s up to the manager whether more players come in or whether they don\u2019t. That\u2019s not for us to worry about. That\u2019s got to be the aim. We have to challenge the best and be the best. It has to be that philosophy at this club no matter what happens, this season is no different. We finished last season with a trophy. We\u2019ve got a good feeling going into this one. We\u2019ve got the Super Cup coming up pretty quick, so we\u2019ve got to be focused on that really and then the season ahead.\u201d The United goalkeeper Sergio Romero has signed a contract extension until 2021. The Argentina international, 30, joined United on a free transfer in 2015 and started May\u2019s Europa League final victory over Ajax ahead of David de Gea.The United squad fly to Utah on Tuesday, where they will play Real Salt Lake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
