But it is also the game they play in Sydney - which is why it isn't, and will probably never be, the game they play in Melbourne. There will undoubtedly be some whose Rugby World Cup has runneth over in the past week or so. But football in Australia is distinctly tribal. It fosters not merely allegiance to one's own code but an active disdain for others. Melbourne is the locus classicus of Australian rules, that all-in, mud-wrestling game which, to its followers, comes like a second language - for some of them, a first language. Contempt for rugby, like suspicion of all things Sydney, is bred in the bone here. We would not cross the street to see it for free. Promoters of the World Cup doubtless drew heart from the reputation of Melburnians as a great sporting population. This is a city where horses are known as \"he\" and \"she\" rather than \"it\"; the Melbourne Cricket Ground has hosted Test cricket crowds exceeding 90,000, and three years ago was sold out for games of Olympic football. It was curious, none the less, to be part of the crowd on the night of Australia's contest with Italy - apparently the Games' great draw-card. Patrons talked among themselves while a prefatory women's international was played, then sat in what can only be described as rapt incomprehension through the main event. Led to expect a species of Olympic \"supersport\", they slowly realised they had been conned: it was still bloody soccer, that round-ball code where the players fall over like they have been shot by a sniper and the goals come fortnightly. In the great tradition, the friend I had accompanied returned from the gents just as the only score was being fished from the back of the net. The Australian sports fan, it should be said, is more ecumenical than he was. Rugby has even made some inroads into the vernacular here. One hears pub conversations in which the expression \"built like a prop\" is being used in preference to the traditional Australian idiom for a solid physique (\"built like a brick shit-house\") and various emergent global alternatives (\"built like the governor of California\"). During major sporting events, Australians can also usually be relied upon to lose perspective. This tradition was maintained by the prime minister John Howard in his benediction at the opening ceremony when he exhorted his audience \"to remember that, of the more than 200 people who died in Bali just a year ago, 132 of them came from rugby-playing nations\". So dressing the next few weeks up as a World Cup may convince some that they're missing out on sport in excelsis. But it's not so much that Melburnians think Aussie rules superior to rugby - it's that we know it is. Near Melbourne's Flinders Street gateway are giant billboards advertising \"I Am Blood\" and \"The Age of Unbeauty\". Although these are dance performances scheduled for Melbourne's International Arts Festival, they might have been inspired by rugby's local reputation. The organisers have even betrayed their event's inauthenticity by staging it at the gimcrack Telstra Dome rather than the venerable MCG. This is a bit like the Three Tenors coming to Sydney and saying: \"Opera House, shmopera house. Let's go find a pub with a karaoke machine.\" Aside from the usual obstacles of regional affiliation, the World Cup seems to fail two crucial antipodean tests. For one, you cannot dress up rugby union as something inherently Australian. It's not ours - and that matters here. A history of the growth of Australian rules by our finest historian Geoffrey Blainey bears the title A Game of Our Own. The best essay collection about the emergence of rugby league is A League of Our Own, edited by David Headon and Lex Marinos. And while historians contend that we did not invent cricket, W G Grace sure sledged like an Aussie. For two, it would seem, this is a tournament in which Australia might not triumph. This is a disastrous design oversight. Like most countries, we distinguish crisply between the world's important and unimportant sports by the classic rule of thumb: the significant ones are those at which we succeed, the trivial those at which we fail. Or those in which England win. While Australians love sport, furthermore, more than that they love winners, whether they be our Steve, our Nicole, or our Kylie. At losing, we are not nearly so accomplished, especially when we don't have perfidious Albion to blame (Gallipoli, Singapore etc). So while the Wallabies might be essaying the game they play in heaven, all things being equal, purgatory seems their likelier ultimate venue.
