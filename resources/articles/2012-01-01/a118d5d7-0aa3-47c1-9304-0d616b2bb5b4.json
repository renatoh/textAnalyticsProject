Thankfully, the stylish midfielder's touch, vision and his coolly-taken, sensationally unjust penalty prevented the FA Cup fourth round's grudge match becoming its drudge match. MATCH OF THE DAY New-town clubs: no one likes them, they don't care. League Two Crawley Town caused a fine Cup upset by beating Hull City 1-0 at the KC Stadium, thanks to a goal from the prolific striker with the Roy of the Rovers name, Matt Tubbs \u2013 his eighth in nine games. COACH OF THE DAY John Coleman gave up his crown as the League's longest-serving manager this week (4,636 days) by puzzlingly leaving Accrington Stanley (two points off the play-offs in League Two) for Rochdale (four points off safety in League One). Happily for him, his new charges beat Bury 3-0. REVIEW OF THE DAY Joey Barton reviewing TV on Twitter: \"As far as football commentators go, Chris Waddle is the worst. Some really bad shouts\u2026 Oh yeah forgot about Jim Beglin, hes pony as well\u2026 Raymundo Wilkins not as bad as previous 2\u2026 No1 by a distance is WADDLE, absolute ballbag.\" STAT OF THE DAY 16: The number of league goals Wycombe have conceded in 2012 \u2013 four more than any of the other 91 English clubs. PLUS: ANSWERED QUESTION What do you give a Liverpool stalwart millionaire on his birthday? David de Gea. Jamie Carragher celebrated his 34th birthday with a Boy's Own win over rivals United thanks to hapless goalkeeper De Gea gifting the Reds two goals (and gifting hacks a supply of cheap shots). Cheap shots, of course, are just one of the kinds that De Gea spills."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
