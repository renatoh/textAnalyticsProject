Stand-off Ryan Lamb was the pick of a Saints side which dominated the first half, scoring tries through Phil Dowson, Tom Wood and Jamie Elliott, two of which Lamb converted. Bath improved after the break, and after the referee David Rose had sin-binned Northampton's Samu Manoa and James Downey, the visitors' pack sent captain Francois Louw over for a push-over try. Even with 13 men Northampton almost responded with a try of their own, but the diving George Pisi just failed to reach Lamb's chip-kick. Captain Dylan Hartley said the Saints were not disappointed with failing to pick up a bonus point win. \"We've got to be more clinical, but otherwise we're pretty happy with the result at the start of a tough series of games,\" said Hartley. Bath, who remain in 10th, will take some encouragement from their second-half effort, but it is now just one win in eight matches for the West Country team. Northampton Saints: Foden, Artemyev, Pisi, Downey, Elliott: Lamb (Myler 76), Dickson: Tonga'uiha (Waller 60), Hartley Haywood 75), Doran-Jones (Mercey 55), Lawes (Manoa 60), Sorenson, Dowson, Wood, Wilson. Bath: Abendanon, Cuthbert, Williams (Scott 52), Barkley (Heathcote 69), Banahan: Donald, Claassens: Flatman (Catt 41), Batty, Wilson, Attwood, Caldwell, Beattie (Ovens 73), Mercer, Louw. Yellow cards: Abendanon (31-41), Donald (47-57), Manoa (61-71), Downey (63-73)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
