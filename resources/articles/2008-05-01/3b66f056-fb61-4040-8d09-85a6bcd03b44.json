Rising star Anamaria Marinca, who won a Bafta for her role in Sex Traffic, is harrowingly convincing as Otilia, loyal friend of the unhappily pregnant Gabita (Laura Vasiliu) whose backstreet termination she organises. Abuse, both financial and physical, follows as the women experience the sharp end of life under Ceausescu's stifling communist regime. Shot in lengthy takes, with the absence of distracting or manipulative music, 4 Months... fulfils writer-director Cristian Mungiu's stated aim of conjuring a style which 'simply witnesses the action, ideally from the main character's perspective, that doesn't transmit the author's message'. Nowhere is this more evident than in the hellish dinner party scene in which Otilia is forced to endure interminable small-talk as her friend lies (bleeding? dying?) in a dismal hotel room, a bravura 10-minute sequence that both horrifies and astonishes. Extras on this well-stocked disc include solid interviews with the thoughtful Mungiu and the glowing Anamaria Marinca, who gets my award for best actress of 2007. There's also an oddly moving documentary following the film's 'Caravan Tour' of Romania, a country in which 20 million people are served by fewer than 50 cinemas, making it the 'least film-going member of the EU'. All the more extraordinary, then, that Romania has produced film-makers of the quality of Mungiu, Corneliu Porumboiu (12.08: East of Bucharest) and Cristi Puiu (The Death of Mr Lazarescu), diverse talents who have all helped to put the country squarely on the international movie map."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
