Morrisons\u2019 groceries will be available for same-day delivery in five new cities this year \u2013 Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, Sheffield and Portsmouth \u2013 and the service will be expanded to further cities in future. Currently Amazon only sells Morrisons groceries for same-day delivery to subscribers to its Prime Now service in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and parts of London and the home counties. The deal deepens Amazon\u2019s relationship with Morrisons, which started just over three years ago when the Bradford-based supermarket first agreed to provide groceries to the US online specialist. It comes after Morrisons last month rejigged its relationship with the online grocery specialist Ocado, which handles deliveries for the Morrisons.com website. The deal enabled Morrisons to sell directly online through other platforms, including Amazon and Deliveroo, and to use other partners to deliver goods from Morrisons.com. Alongside its own store on Amazon\u2019s Prime Now, Morrisons will also continue to sell its goods to other Amazon services such as Amazon Pantry, in which buyers pay one delivery price for as many groceries as they can fit in one box. Food is a priority market for Amazon, which bought the US grocer Whole Foods Market in 2017, giving it hundreds of stores over the Atlantic and six stores here. Doug Gurr, Amazon\u2019s UK country manager, said: \u201cWe are committed to growing our grocery business so that we can continue to deliver what we know our customers will always care about \u2013 low prices, vast selection and fast delivery \u2013 and our relationship with Morrisons is an important part of that long-term growth. With the Morrisons store on Prime Now, many Prime members can do their full weekly grocery shop online through Prime Now with ultra-fast same-day delivery.\u201d Morrisons\u2019 latest deal with Amazon comes as UK supermarkets scramble to grab a share of rising online sales. In February, Marks &amp; Spencer signed a \u00a3750m deal with Ocado under which it will replace Waitrose as the online service\u2019s main grocery provider next year. In a bid to fight back, Waitrose has teamed up with a new company led by the former Ocado executive Jonathan Faiman to help it rapidly expand its Waitrose.com service. Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst for GlobalData, said: \u201cWith the value of the online food market set to increase by 48.9% over the next five years \u2013 significantly higher than the 15.5% for the overall grocery market, according to GlobalData \u2013 it is understandable why Morrisons are looking to bolster growth figures through online expansion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
