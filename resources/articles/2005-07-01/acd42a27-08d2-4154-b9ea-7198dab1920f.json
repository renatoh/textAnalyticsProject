All the potential rivals will be given the chance to address delegates at Blackpool in early October. Shadow cabinet members will be encouraged to deviate from their own policy portfolios, allowing them to set out their wider vision for the future of the party. The party chairman, Francis Maude, said there was no point pretending the leadership election was not imminent. The conference will be held from October 3 to 6 with the new leader due to be in place by mid-November. But Mr Maude insisted the Blackpool gathering would be as much about the future direction of the party as about who would steer the course. The conference will be organised around five central themes: helping people through their lives; building the public services \"we deserve\"; making all Britons better off; improving the places we live and playing our full role on the world stage. Mr Maude said the unconventional structure had been chosen because people's lives did not necessarily mirror government departments. It also means shadow cabinet members will not have to stick to their own policy briefs, and can make wide-ranging speeches more suited to leadership candidates. Mr Maude said speakers would be encouraged to speak \"fluidly and flexibly\" and range beyond their portfolios. Former chancellor Ken Clarke, the only likely contender not in the shadow cabinet, will also be given the chance to speak. He will address conference as part of Michael Howard's advisory board. Former leader William Hague will speak in a similar capacity. He has insisted he will not stand again for the leadership despite pressure from colleagues. All speakers will be allowed slots of the same duration, although the exact slots have yet to be allocated, with some inevitably more coveted than others. Mr Maude said the debate over recent weeks about the future of the party had vindicated Mr Howard's call for a period of reflection about its direction. Mr Maude accepted the conference would become an unofficial hustings. \"There is no point in disguising the fact people are going to be extremely interested in how people who may become contenders for the leadership address the great debate,\" he said. \"We have got the best of both worlds where the contenders can talk and set out their vision and values but nonetheless in order to do that they have to engage in the broad debate that Michael launched.\" Mr Maude was speaking after Tory MPs last night agreed new rules to determine Mr Howard's successor. Under the plan, powers to choose the leader will be taken away from grassroots members and returned to MPs, although activists will be consulted. The plan itself has yet to be approved by party activists and MEPs, who will make their decision in September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
