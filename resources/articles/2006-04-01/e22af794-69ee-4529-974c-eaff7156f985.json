In fact, the law just passed by parliament requires people to be issued an ID card on request as soon as they have registered. If you report your card as stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced, like a passport, as you'd expect, but you can't be permanently refused a card. As for the database, only the fact that a check of identity has been made is recorded, so that you can review when you want to whether anyone unauthorised by you has made the check. There is no record of whether you have filed a prescription or withdrawn money, or any other information about your activity. There is an email from anti-ID campaigners circulating making the same erroneous claims. Obviously there are arguments against ID cards, as with any proposal, but it's a pity if the debate is distorted by misunderstanding. Nick Palmer MP Lab, Broxtowe Jenni Russell's analysis of Blair's persuasive technique was spot-on. The most disturbing fact is the public passivity to this dangerous manipulator and the tiny group of unaccountable aides who help draft the scripts. There needs to be stronger opposition to strengthen those within Labour to get rid of him. A public campaign of opposition and civil disobedience against IDs would be a start. \"Beware the march of IDs\" might be a good focusing title. Any takers out there?
