Last night the companies concerned - Airbus parent Eads and French defence combine Thales - declined to comment after officials in Paris acknowledged that the French government was considering a possible merger of the two businesses. The French government is a leading shareholder in both companies, but Stuttgart-based DaimlerChrysler has a 31% holding in Eads and merger proposals that would weaken German influence would be likely to run into heavy resistance. The political sensitivity of any Eads-Thales merger was underlined yesterday by divisions over whether the issue would be on the agenda at today's talks between German finance minister Wolfgang Clement and his French opposite number, Nicolas Sarkozy. The Germans said yesterday the future of Eads and Thales would \"play a role\" in the talks, but French officials denied this was the case. Relations between Paris and Berlin over industrial policy are already strained. Germany was unhappy about France's decision to bail out heavy engineering group Alstom and about government support for a merger between French pharmaceuticals firm Sanofi and its Franco-German peer, Aventis. A merger of Eads and Thales would create the world's largest defence group. In the UK, Eads employs about 12,000 people in sectors ranging from space equipment and missiles to defence systems and Airbus. Thales, which established itself in the UK with the \u00a31.3bn acquisition of Racal in 2000, employs 11,000 British workers. Both companies are leading suppliers to the Ministry of Defence, which last night said any merger was \"a commercial decision for the shareholders of the two companies\". The French government has 31% of Thales but only 15% of Eads which could make it difficult to drive through a merger. \"The French have been trying to create a European champion in defence, which for them often means a French champion,\" according to Daniel Keohane, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform in London. \"They clearly haven't given up, but whether the Germans will be eager for this is another question,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
