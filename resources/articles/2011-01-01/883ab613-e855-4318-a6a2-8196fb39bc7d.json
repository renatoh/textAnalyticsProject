It makes little difference whether the local authority is red, blue or yellow, political choice is a scarce luxury when cutting to the bone. Yesterday a gathering of parents outside Stoke-on-Trent town hall protested at the threatened closure of seven out of 16 children's centres in one of the most deprived towns. Six thousand families signed a petition, and the movement is growing. Melissa Beydilli, mother of a two-year-old at Blurton children's centre, has become a national standard bearer, contacted by mothers all over the country starting their own protests. Sure Start was Labour's best monument, yet still oddly unknown except to the families of the 2.7 million children who use it. Melissa speaks movingly of how her centre rescued her when her son's behaviour problems became so bad she never went out and was even \"afraid to take him to the supermarket \u2026 I'd go to bed thinking, 'Oh no, I've got another day with him tomorrow'.\" The centre saw she wasn't coping. \"They gave me so much help, showed me how to calm him down, how to play with him. My relationship with him has completely changed.\" If you ever visit a centre \u2013 which you should \u2013 you will hear plenty of stories like hers. You will see how these 3,500 life-enhancing places have become hubs for community activity: mothers creating a fount of local action are where the real \"big society\" happens. Melissa runs the family support group raising funds for children's trips: now they campaign full-time to save the centres. David Cameron promises new community organisers, when he should be starting here. A survey by 4Children and the Daycare Trust this week revealed that 250 may shut altogether, with most suffering deep cuts to their services. The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS), representing all those miserable council officials required to decide where to cut their hard-pressed departments, reckons the survey is an underestimate: more will be closed, while others are reduced to a token shell. Marion Davis, the head of ADCS, is children's director for Warwickshire. She explains the dilemmas: she has to cut 30% from everything apart from schools \u2013 in other words, social workers for children at risk, children in care, school transport, disabled children's care, youth justice and other statutory work that must be done. She has sent out warning notices to 800 of her 2,200 staff that their jobs are at risk. \"I never dreamt we would have to cut some of the things we will cut,\" she says. Her costs are rising fast. The recession is bringing in a tide of new problems: unemployment is leading to higher drug use, and more domestic violence, mental health crises and family breakdowns. The Baby P case caused 25% more children to be referred to social services nationally: 17% more arrived in care last year. Add in the phenomenal, but largely unmentioned, cost of the rising number of profoundly mentally and physically disabled children, now often teenagers, who would never have survived infancy but now do \u2013 just about \u2013 thanks to the heroic neonatal specialists in maternity units. Most of these extreme cases end up in care, costing hundreds of thousands in round-the-clock teams to look after them. Just a few can upend a children's services' budget. So, faced with extreme crises, what gets dropped first? It's always early prevention of worse problems to come. When respite care is cut, families like Celyn Vincent's finally crack under the strain of caring for a quadriplegic child alone \u2013 and social services may end up shouldering the whole burden. Where in this pecking order of need should children's centres come? They offer the earliest help to young children, identifying difficulties before it's too late, a welcoming place to which families can turn. ADCS and 4Children find no particular political pattern in the local cuts. Some councils will keep all their centres open, but thin out what happens inside them. Others will close all but those in the most deprived areas, and keep them reasonably intensive. Either way, this is a heart-breaking destruction of a service that was starting to change children's life chances. Which universities they go to once they pass their A-levels gets considerably more attention than whether they have a chance to thrive before they get to school. Sarah Teather, children's minister, puts out a blithe statement: \"Sure Start is at the heart of our vision for early intervention \u2013 that's why we have ensured there is enough money in the system to maintain the network of Sure Start children's centres, as well as provided new investment for health visitors. I understand that local authorities are facing difficult decisions which require local discussion and hard choices\u2026 The new Early Intervention Grant gives local authorities the freedom and flexibility to make the best decisions for the families in their communities.\" This sleight of hand drives children's services directors to distraction. Teather has indeed given a specific Early Intervention Grant to cover Sure Start \u2013 but as she well knows, it is considerably less than the bundle of 22 grants it replaces. It amounts to a \u00a31.4bn cut in all early intervention programmes. What's more, the government has removed the requirement for children's centres in the poorest places to provide child care, so some mothers may have to abandon work. Centres no longer need a trained nursery teacher or early-years professional of graduate status: low-paid, low-qualified staff can't give the expert remedial help many families need. Worse still, the money is not ringfenced, so \"early intervention\" to stop tomorrow's crises is sucked away to cope with today's emergencies. Examples of the coalition's electoral dishonesty have become commonplace. Cameron said: \"Yes, we back Sure Start. It's a disgrace that Gordon Brown has been trying to frighten people about this.\" Nick Clegg made a promise too. Maria Miller, then Tory shadow minister for the family, said: \"It's unforgiveable that Labour has used the tactics of creating fear and anxiety amongst families and Sure Start staff.\" Well, they are afraid now \u2013 and angry. This is the way the social deficit grows, costing the next generation more than the fiscal deficit with a legacy of costly problems that could have been prevented with a little early spending. Ignoring this mounting debt is the other kind of deficit denial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
