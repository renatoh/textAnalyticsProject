According to the World Bank, progress to ending extreme poverty is much slower in fragile states than elsewhere and it estimates that by 2030 40% of the world\u2019s poor will live in states that are fragile or affected by conflict. As a result, many organisations working in various parts of the development sector have projects designed to improve this situation. But what are these interventions? How can governments, the private sector, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society work together most productively? And how can any of those bodies learn from the experience of others? These were some of the questions addressed at a recent seminar held at the Guardian\u2019s London offices in association with the Crown Agents Foundation \u2013 a non-profit-making body that oversees the work of development organisation Crown Agents. The seminar featured a panel of experts who discussed these issues, with the participation of an invited audience including NGOs, the private sector, academics and civil society organisations. The panellists Jonathan Borsley, director for consultancy, Crown Agents Carolyn Miller, independent consultant and ex-chief executive of Merlin Andrew Bone, group head of government and industry relations, De Beers Paul Smith Lomas, international director, Practical Action Jo Confino (chair), executive editor, the Guardian Jonathan Borsley Borsley kicked off the event by looking at one of the key issues involved in working in fragile states: was it better to prioritise the short-term goals of service delivery or the longer-term change involved in sustainability and capacity building? \u201cWhen there is acute social need, the focus of the international community is on meeting basic needs as opposed to building longer-term sustainability,\u201d he said. As a result, prioritising short-term goals can often seem inevitable. For example, Crown Agents had been focused on long-term sustainability in South Sudan, recalled Borsley, where the government had not been much involved in the provision of healthcare. Instead, such services were being delivered by international NGOs and civil society across the country. Crown Agents was working in the country as a managing agent, in partnership with local and international NGOs, as well as the government, to improve the health service. But then, in December 2013, the latest round of conflict erupted and the focus had to move back to short-term service provision. Borsley said: \u201cIn fragile environments, you expect the unexpected.\u201d Carolyn Miller Miller, speaking next, considered that it can be possible to both achieve \u201csignificant fixes\u201d and deliver services. In particular, Miller addressed the role of government and the role in its citizens\u2019 lives. She said: \u201cGenerally [the state] does exist somewhere. But the community is clearly important and may not be used to the state working with them, needing help to become engaged with it.\u201d With reference to her experience with health services in fragile states, she continued: \u201cWorkers are also important to the success of any health project, whether they are NGO health workers, or local or ministry workers. The state is generally happy if you fill the gaps,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even from day one you can build capacity\u201d. She also pointed out that fragile states are all different, and in some it may be easier to work in than others. In countries where there are fewer organisations involved, it may be possible to make direct contact with decision-makers from all sectors. Andrew Bone Bone discussed his experience of setting up the Kimberley Process in the late 1990s, which ensures that \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d do not enter the mainstream. This involved collaboration between De Beers, governments in Africa and the countries that buy diamonds, civil society and the private sector. \u201cWe were all experts. We had to get our act together,\u201d he said. De Beers had already had a long-term involvement with governments, including the public-private partnership between De Beers and the government of Botswana, which has now lasted 45 years (De Beers and the Botswana government have a company with 50-50 shares for each to work on the diamond mines). Botswana has become a middle-income country benefiting from its valuable natural resources. However, De Beers had not had experience in dealing with civil society but saw clearly the need to be engaged with it as part of the solution. The Kimberley Process was implemented in 2003. However, there are still challenges, Bone said, particularly in Zimbabwe where illegal diamond miners were murdered by government forces in 2008. He added: \u201cNGOs were frustrated with the pace of the Kimberley Process and there was an industry that was desperate. It was a great challenge for us to work constructively with civil society to get on top of this.\u201d However, it worked, Zimbabwe was subject to close scrutiny by Kimberley Process monitors over three years, blocking official exports of diamonds during that period, and eventually the country complied with the Kimberley Process. Paul Smith Lomas Smith Lomas then described Practical Action\u2019s experience of working in Sudan with a network of 150 civil society women\u2019s organisations which, in turn, reach 170,000 people. The project has enabled 6,000 families to switch from using charcoal for cooking, to using liquid petroleum gas stoves instead. Practical Action worked with a UK-based private sector carbon broker to help the network issue the country\u2019s first ever carbon credits. \u201cWe were the intermediary and sometimes the backstop donor, but it produced real results,\u201d he said. There were many challenges \u2013 getting carbon credit accreditation was hard, as most of the private sector had no interest in going to Sudan. But Practical Action was in the right place at a time when there were few international NGOs working on development in Sudan due to the conflict. Smith Lomas said: \u201cThe three key ingredients were long-term relationships, seriously flexible and friendly donors, and exemplary staff from north Darfur who were able to step above the conflict and position themselves as acting for the mutual good.\u201d The discussion about partnerships continued, touching on many aspects of this complex issue. As one participant put it: \u201cGroups don\u2019t talk to each other, there is funding from different people with different ideas.\u201d Value of partnerships Another pointed out that partnerships were increasingly seen as a necessity by donors, and these partnerships needed to involve the private sector and academics, not simply five NGOs working together. \u201cMany development programmes are getting larger, so the hurdle for access is higher,\u201d said Borsley. \u201cSMEs and civil society are left out. The bar is set high.\u201d Another participant mentioned that smaller NGOs were finding it harder to get involved. Many of those attending also touched upon failure and the need to learn from it. Whether it was ineffective partnerships, culturally inappropriate projects, or those that just didn\u2019t quite work, it was important to consider why \u2013 and yet this was done all too rarely. Among other projects, a range of work done in Afghanistan, from microfinance to service delivery by NGOs, was mentioned. According to Smith Lomas: \u201cWe suffer from a culture of success and hate stories of failure. Donors will think \u2018we won\u2019t fund them next time\u2019. We need to be braver.\u201d One participant considered that the attitude of donors was changing, and they now wanted to know about projects that had not achieved what had been anticipated at the outset. So was it the job of partnerships between the government and other development-related bodies to understand or work on the causes of any state\u2019s fragility, or should they confine themselves to dealing with the symptoms? One participant wondered if success should be focused on whether this underlying fragility was being addressed. Miller agreed that it was important, but donors often saw that as \u201cmission creep\u201d, outside the remit of the organisation\u2019s work. So what is the most important element in building these government/NGO/private and civil sector partnerships? One that both the panellists and many of the audience agreed on was trust between those involved in the partnerships. Examples of trust mentioned by participants were: Accountability and transparency in working methods Buy-in from communities that have often been in conflict with each other Dealing with complaints about tax evasion and avoidance, and the lethargy of governments All these need to be taken into account. Each member of the partnership had something different to offer: for instance, participants heard that the private sector often had a longer-term perspective, and was able to take more risks than NGOs. De Beers, for instance, felt it was important to invest in a country over the long term \u2013 it took some 20-30 years between discovering raw diamonds to gaining any profit at all. Bone said: \u201cThis is not just philanthropy, we have to engage with the local community. If we don\u2019t engage we are lost.\u201d Borsley stressed that close engagement with civil society and local organisations maximised the chances of government and private sector partnerships working well. \u201cA local organisation will understand the pressure points so much more than us,\u201d he concluded.
