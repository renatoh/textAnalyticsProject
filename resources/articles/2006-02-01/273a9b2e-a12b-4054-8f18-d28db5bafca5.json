If you want tooth decay on a grand scale, Demel's sculptural confections will fit the bill. To join the Viennese political elite, the Cafe Landtmann is ideal. The Cafe Sperl, however, provides the ultimate caffeine high. Tucked away near the Naschmarkt, away from the main tourist drag, the Sperl opened in 1880. A marriage of coffee grounds to high ceilings, lashings of marble and Belle Epoque ideals, the Sperl has everything a museum refusenik might need to while away a wet afternoon - velvet banquettes, dusty charm, waiters who wouldn't dream of hassling an empty cup away from you, newspapers on sticks, a couple of billiard tables, hearty portions of apfel strudel mit schlag, and endless variations on a cup of coffee, none of which involve decaffeination, soy milk, or are prefixed with the word 'skinny'. Cafe Sperl, Gumpendorfer Strasse 11, 00 43 1 586 4158; www.cafesperl.at What does that letter on your airline ticket mean? Of all the bits of information on an airline ticket, a single letter can tell you just how comfortable your trip is likely to be. The letter you're looking for is just before the date of the flight. It tells the check-in person just how much you paid for your flight which dictates your chances of getting an upgrade or even a decent seat at the front of the plane. The letter Y on a BA ticket, for instance, denotes a full economy fare, while S, Q and O are evidence that it's a discounted fare and your rightful place might well be by the toilets. Each airline has its own code, but luckily www.flyertalk.com, which is devoted to airline minutiae, gives a detailed rundown in its Miles &amp; Points forum. Yet more proof that airline passengers are in a hierarchy every bit as complex as an English public school in the Thirties. How to deal with stray dogs abroad 'Stray dogs abroad aren't like domestic pets in this country, so don't expect them to react the same way,' says Carol O'Herlihy of Bark Busters, the largest dog-training organisation in the world. 'Dogs assess us by scenting us and they need to be almost touching us to do this effectively. Stand still and wait until he has had the chance to sniff your feet and legs. Don't pet him while he's assessing you. This is very bad manners in his world - a bit like you going up to a stranger and giving them a passionate embrace. 'If a dog rolls over on his back, it's not always a sign that he wants his tummy tickled. It could be a sign of submission and if you try and tickle him he might feel trapped and attack you in self-defence. Take into account his body language. 'If you meet a pack of dogs, stand still. They are probably on a hunting expedition and will lose interest in you if you remain uninteresting.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
