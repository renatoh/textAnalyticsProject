All seems well, apart from Nina's nightmares about being chased on a dark night by the light of the moon. She and Irfan put it down to the pressure of her job and the stress of arranging the marriage. But when Irfan's cousin Shahzaman turns up for the ceremony there is an instant attraction between them. Loosely based on Lorca's Blood Wedding, A Dark River is a promising and slick piece of visual theatre that looks lush, combines text, movement and video to considerable effect and has an extraordinary Indian-inspired soundtrack that casts a hypnotic shroud over the entire show. If the whole thing doesn't quite pack the emotional punch that it should, it is almost certainly due to too much ambition rather than too little. The introduction of a storyline where Nina and Shahzaman are supposed to have known each other from a past life in turn-of-the-century Spain is not only preposterous and confusing but actually diffuses rather than increases the emotional impact of the show. Nonetheless this is a truly enjoyable, well thought-out work offering the kind of total visual theatre, rather than just physically based work, that is in short supply at the festival. At the Theatre Workshop (0131-226 5425) until Saturday, and the Pleasance Above (0131-556 6550) from August 20-27.
