Australia will be left in the wake of these big economies (and big emitters), according to the latest Climate Council report Lagging Behind: Australia and the Global Response to Climate Change. Australia\u2019s retreat from being a global leader at tackling climate change is as impressive as our recent performances at the cricket. Looking on the bright side, even countries not known for their sunshine like Germany are going solar in a big way. Global momentum is building as more and more countries invest in renewable energy and put a price on carbon. Thirty-nine countries are putting a price on carbon. The EU and China (now with seven pilot schemes up and running) are home to the two largest carbon markets in the world, together covering over 3,000m tonnes (MtCO2) of carbon dioxide emissions. There\u2019s also plenty of action in the US: 10 states with a combined population of 79 million are now using carbon pricing to drive down emissions, including California, the world\u2019s ninth largest economy. Yet, here in Australia, we now hold the dubious distinction of being the first country to repeal an operating and effective carbon price. Like carbon pricing, support for renewables is also advancing worldwide. In the last year, more renewable energy capacity was added than fossil fuels. Globally renewables attracted greater investment with US$192bn spent on new renewable power compared to US$102bn in fossil fuel plants. China is leading the charge on expanding renewable capacity. At the end of last year, China had installed a whopping 378GW of renewable energy capacity \u2013 about a quarter of renewables capacity installed worldwide, and over seven times Australia\u2019s entire grid-connected power capacity. China continues to work towards ambitious capacity targets for 439GW of renewables by 2015 and 900GW by 2020. China is also acting to limit coal consumption in an effort to tackle air pollution and climate change. Despite over 1m households installing solar power on their rooftops, uncertainty looms large over Australia\u2019s renewable energy target. This uncertainty is stifling investment \u2013 70% less in 2014 compared with the previous year. Australia\u2019s commitment to tackling climate change resembles a teenager\u2019s resolve to get out of bed in the morning. The federal government\u2019s shiny new Direct Action plan, with a lofty 5% emissions reduction target, has been described by some as a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d scheme. Yet as the host of the upcoming G20 Summit in Brisbane, rather than shirtfronting other member countries, Australia has an ideal opportunity to work with the international community and join the big guns \u2013 China, the US and the EU \u2013 in making progress on climate change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
