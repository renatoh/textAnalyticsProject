Police said Friday that 20-year-old Tarania Clarke was killed during a fight with another woman over a cellphone. The stabbing occurred late Thursday in the capital of Kingston. Officials say the unidentified woman has been detained. Clarke, a midfielder who was also captain of the Waterhouse FC in Jamaica\u2019s Women\u2019s League, had just made her senior international debut for the Reggae Girlz in September, scoring a goal in a 12-1 win over Cuba in an Olympic qualifying match. Michael Ricketts, president of Jamaica\u2019s football federation, said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d in a statement. \u201cThis was a young lady who has shown much potential and was very pleasant, warm and had real potential to make it at the highest level,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cShe was very much a part of the Reggae Girlz squad during the recent Olympic qualifiers and did make an impact. \u201cI offer condolences to the family and friends of young Clarke.\u201d Xavier Gilbert, Clarke\u2019s coach at Excelsior high school, told Jamaica-based cable TV station SportsMax that she was planning on moving to the United States in January to attend university in Florida pending the completion of her paperwork. \u201cWe were very close. She was captain for the last three years and was a wonderful leader, a wonderful person,\u201d he told the network. \u201cIt hurts right now. It\u2019s really sad. She did not deserve this. This really rough right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
