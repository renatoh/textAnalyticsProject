This reflection has been prompted by his reactions to being handed around. Like all parents, we began being quite careful about who we handed him to, but now we do it just for somewhere to put him. Were it socially acceptable, we\u2019d probably rest him on the bonnet of an idling taxi if it gave us a second to grab our wallets. But, although he spent the first nine months of his life unmoved by anything less eventful than a building collapse, he\u2019s now more discerning about who holds him, not to mention heavier, squirmier and more of a handful in every sense. \u2018Oh, right, wow,\u2019 people say as they hold him, wincing as if we\u2019ve handed them a lorry engine. \u2018Unnngh. Yep. He\u2019s, er, really grown.\u2019 It\u2019s not that he\u2019s particularly big for a toddler, of course, it\u2019s just that since he\u2019s not walking yet and has very fair hair, he\u2019s something of an optical illusion; a child who bears the essence of being a baby, but without their pleasingly compact size. We try to think of it as an upgrade on the usual baby package, a little bit of extra baby for our money, the maxi-baby plan, perhaps, or Baby+. Having a toddler who can\u2019t, well, toddle, is not without its challenges. I worry that our friends have started to dread visiting us, the way I would if every time I went round to their house I was expected to lift Gregg Wallace out of a high chair. Then there are his moods. Though ordinarily a very even-natured child, he\u2019s getting a bit of an attitude, so roughly one in five times he meets someone, he\u2019ll either start crying or just slap them in the face. \u2018Oh,\u2019 my wife will say, aghast, \u2018he\u2019s just tired.\u2019 I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m similarly courteous, but I\u2019ve been known to rub it in. \u2018That\u2019s so weird,\u2019 I\u2019ll say. \u2018I mean, seriously, this kid likes everyone.\u2019 There are probably some reasons not to use my infant son as an emotional cudgel with which to beat my enemies, but I can\u2019t recall any right now. Fortunately, I don\u2019t spend much time with people I hate but, unfortunately, this means the occasions when he does this to a deserving recipient are infrequent, so I usually find myself resenting his pleasantness to some guy I hated from four jobs ago. \u2018Seriously? You like this turd?\u2019 I say to myself, telepathically willing him to be sick on their tie. And then he\u2019s often unkind to a child with whom we\u2019re forcing him to bond. This new independence is good, but it\u2019s sad that our former inducements just don\u2019t take any more. Like when a passing train\u2019s wi-fi shows up on your phone, our over-eagerness to make him connect ends up looking strange and strangely pathetic. \u2018You can try that on with a baby,\u2019 he seems to say, \u2018but this is a Baby+ you\u2019re talking to.\u2019 Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
