The penalty shootout was cruel, but penalty shoot-outs always are, and England were guilty of missing three. Nor can England kid themselves that the premature end to Wayne Rooney's World Cup was undeserved or unfairly harsh. Rooney's offence was hardly any more serious than David Beckham's eight years ago, but he knows the rules, and the fact that England played better with 10 men and a more familiar formation says everything about the tactics they were employing beforehand. Even when fit, Rooney failed to make an impact on this tournament and that had nothing to do with the referee. Sven-Goran Eriksson and his half-baked plan to play him as a lone striker was responsible for making Rooney peripheral. The feisty Manchester United player was still struggling to get into the match even as he was being ordered out of it. Eriksson will be able to use the dismissal as an excuse, as Glenn Hoddle did with Beckham in 1998 and on numerous occasions since, but there is absolutely no evidence that the way England were playing and the way Rooney was playing he would ever have left a mark on the World Cup. In losing his third head-to-head with Luiz Felipe Scolari, this time with fewer excuses than previously, Eriksson saw fine performances from Owen Hargreaves, John Terry and Steven Gerrard, although it was the lack of strikers, as predicted, that cost England. Plus the decision-making. At least the departing England manager was taking it on the chin. 'We were not good enough this time, especially the penalties,' he said. 'Quarter-finals four years ago was OK, two years ago was OK, but this time we should at least be in the semi. We are not. We are here again and it is more our fault than any force of Portugal, although good luck to them.' It is not quite true that Eriksson has used a different formation in each of England's games here. He has actually used three formations in five games - 4-4-2 twice, then 4-1-3-2, and now 4-5-1 twice - although each time the personnel has changed, so no two line-ups have been identical. Many people, this observer included, thought the middle one best, although after the defensive lapses in the second half against Sweden it went out of the window along with some of the other ideas Eriksson tried and rejected in this tournament, such as Peter Crouch as a starter, Michael Carrick, and David Beckham at right-back. It was Gary Neville's return from injury that allowed Eriksson to play his first-choice back four and therefore his first-choice midfield, with Hargreaves returned to what ought to be his best position. With Beckham under fire for his scant contribution from open play, four of England's midfielders had something to prove - only Joe Cole, in what used to be the problem position out on the left, has had a wholly satisfactory World Cup, and he ended up being sacrificed. Hargreaves fully justified his inclusion ahead of Carrick and brought some defensive steel to the centre of the pitch, and hearing the crowd chanting 'There's only one Owen Hargreaves' must have represented the biggest U-turn since Crouch won supporters over with his robot dance. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, as ever, just needed to show they could play effectively together. The early signs were not good. Gerrard gave the ball away with his first pass, an overadventurous one in Rooney's direction, although Portugal kindly returned it and the striker saw a second-minute shot blocked. When Beckham tried to find Rooney a couple of minutes later, he did so from a position 40 yards down the pitch and Portugal's defenders intercepted the pass easily. Rooney is not the sort of striker who enjoys playing that far ahead of his colleagues, and with him on his own up front England knew they either had to support him or get wide players farther forward. Gerrard and Neville both did better in this respect in England's next attacks, although both times their crosses were too high. Gerrard took a decision to move himself closer to Rooney mid-way through the first half, though England were not passing accurately enough to find either. Hargreaves was defending diligently, but Lampard, apart from when he almost connected with a Gerrard cross at the far post, was rarely in the right place at the right time. With Portugal sensibly keeping first-half free-kicks to a minumum, Beckham was an almost neglible presence. Portugal were attempting, with limited success, to do what they did in Lisbon two years ago and pass around England. Their movement and passing were superior, though it was only Cristiano Ronaldo and to a lesser extent Luis Figo who looked like penetrating the England defence. No one really looked like penetrating Portugal's and when Hargreaves made a promising run down the left just before half time he looked up from the byline to find a penalty area bereft of white shirts. Rooney should have been there in theory, except he doesn't score that many goals with his head or get on the end of many crosses. His forte is running at defenders from deep positions, carrying the ball into danger areas and either releasing team-mates or lining up a shot for himself, yet Eriksson went down the tunnel at half time aware that his star player had yet to score a goal or make one in this tournament. Fitness is no longer an issue - the challenge to England was to find a better way of using him. Scolari and his players kept England waiting on the pitch for the restart, although perhaps more significant was the fact that neither side made any changes. That only lasted seven minutes, a tearful Beckham making way for Aaron Lennon. It was not clear whether Beckham was crying through pain or disappointment with a knee injury, although what was immediately apparent, as soon as Lennon touched the ball, was that he should have been on the pitch earlier. His very first run set up England's best chance of the opening hour, taking the ball past two defenders into the area and laying off a pass from which first Rooney then Joe Cole could have done a lot better. Rooney's afternoon and tournament then became a great deal worse with a red card that looked harsh, until replays established he had subtly kicked Ricardo Carvalho in the crotch right under the referee's nose. Carvalho had been fouling him, and England were incensed that Maniche had just conned a free-kick from the referee with an outrageous piece of play-acting, although as Beckham proved eight years ago in St Etienne, there is no longer any scope at all for foot-to-player contact when the referee is nearer to the incident than the ball. Too late, Crouch was brought on and Joe Cole undeservedly withdrawn as England switched to 4-4-1. Unbelievably, England improved in this formation, so think how much better 4-4-2 might have been. 'I have to congratulate England, with 10 players they played an incredible match, it was electrifying,' Scolari said. The Portugal coach sensibly refrained from commenting on Rooney's red card, explaining that it was the referee's job, although he did offer a view on the choice of Hargreaves as man of the match. 'Fifa can pick who they like as long as we keep getting through,' Scolari said after his twelfth World Cup match without defeat. Lennon missed a decent chance to score seven minutes from the end of normal time, though inevitably going a man down allowed Portugal to play their passing game more easily, and England finished the 90 minutes defending stubbornly but superbly. With Terry going close to scoring at the other end England were at last taking part in an enthralling game and went some way to restoring their reputation as gritty battlers in a breathlessly exciting extra half-hour. Eriksson's reputation might be ruined, but at last his England players stood up and showed what they are made of. It's just a bit late for this World Cup, that's all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
