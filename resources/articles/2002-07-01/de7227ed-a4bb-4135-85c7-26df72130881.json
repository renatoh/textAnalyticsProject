And while Italian food culture has until recently been more interested in tradition than innovation, the Roman restaurant scene is far from static. In the last few years, many of the traditional white-linen restaurants have been weeded out by recession and a greater demand for quality. Into the void has stepped an army of new, young establishments. Another recent phenomenon is the increasing number of regional cuisines represented in Rome: Neapolitan, Calabrian, Sicilian, Sardinian and Marchigiano (from the Marches). Italians are so territorial that these interlopers could be numbered among the city's foreign restaurants. The final novelty - but by no means the least significant - is the rise of the superchef in a city that has always been low on Michelin stars. While chefs in Rome traditionally were known only to nearby residents, times have changed and the celebrity chef concept has arrived. Alongside 'ristorante' and 'pizzeria' - which should need no explanation - you are likely to come across a few other terms. A 'trattoria' is, of course, a small family-run place, offering hearty local cuisine. An 'osteria' is, in theory, a drinking den with a limited range of basic dishes and a menu that is generally recited out loud; the same goes for the 'taverna'. But in practice, these names are increasingly fluid, and many place that describe themselves as 'osterie' are, these days, decidedly upmarket. WHERE TO... ...do brunch Babington's Piazza di Spagna 23 (06 678 6027). Metro Spagna. Open: 9am - 8.15pm Mon, Wed -Sun. Credit cards: American Express, Diner's Card, Master Card, Visa. Britons may not consider visiting tea rooms abroad a priority, but will often be directed there by well-meaning Romans convinced that they cannot survive without an overpriced pot of tea and a plate of cakes. Founded by two British spinsters, Babington's has been around since the late 19th century, and it shows. Considering its exorbitant prices, the surroundings are down-at-heel. The menu offers a wide selection of teas from around the world, ranging from seven euros for a small pot to an absurd 30 euros for more exotic selections. Since the most reasonably priced items on the menu are the long drinks at 10 euros, we recommend you overlook the teas and treat yourself to a stiff one. ...get serious coffee Faggiani Via G Ferrari 23-9 (06 3973 9742). Bus to piazza Mazzini. Open: 6.30am-9pm Mon, Tue; 6.30am-8pm Thur-Sun. Closed two weeks in August. Credit: AmEx, MC, V. As pleasant for breakfast as for an evening aperitivo, this pleasant family bar with excellent coffee has the added attraction of being attached to one of Rome's finest pasticcerie. Its worth coming all the way to Prati, even if you're miles away, just to sample the cornetti and buddino di riso (sweet rice-filled tartlets), which are probably the best in Rome. ...take the parents Checco er Carrettiere Via Benedetta 10/13 (06 581 7018/ 580 0985). Bus to piazza Trilussa. Meals served: 12.30-2.30pm, 8-11pm Mon-Sat; 1-3pm Sun. Credit: AmEx, DC, MC, V. This Trastevere restaurant is a throwback to Rome's 'Hollywood on the Tiber' days, when film people from Federico Fellini to Henry Fonda piled in for classics like bombolotti alla matriciana (with tangy tomato and bacon) or spaghetti alla carbonara (with egg and bacon). Their pictures line the walls; the other salient feature of the decor is garlic, which hangs in un-ironic strings from a high wood-beamed ceiling. These days Checco is still good for hearty high-octane Roman cuisine. The helpings are huge, the service friendly, and the Frascati house wine is surprisingly smooth and drinkable. In summer, tables spill out into a cool courtyard. ...take the kids La Torricella Via E Torricelli 2/4 (06 574 6311/www.latorricella.com). Bus to Lungotevere Testaccio. Meals served: noon-3.30pm, 7pm-midnight daily. Credit: AmEx, DC, MC, V. For the full experience, come to La Torricella in the summer and sit at the outside tables in this residential street. Babies cry, families fight and on match nights a hundred televisions provide a wall-of-sound accompaniment to your meal. Inside, the spirit of one of actor-director Roberto Benigni's favourite haunts comes through. The food consists of good-value Roman with a fishy angle: the spaghetti alla vongole (with clams) is always reliable. In the evening, there are an array of pizzas also on offer. ...take a date Al Ponte della Ranocchia Circovallazione Appia 29 (06 785 6712). Metro Ponte Lungo. Meals served: 12.30-2.30pm, 8-11.30pm Mon-Sat. Closed for one week in August. Credit: AmEx, DC, MC, V. Don't be fooled by the simple trattoria decor, with the hatch through to the kitchen and the 1930s-style travertine facing on the walls. 'At the bridge of the frog' uses Jewish and Levantine influences to put a welcome spin on the local tradition, with much emphasis on fresh ingredients and a well-priced wine list. House speciality is the Routa del Faraone, a lightly fried wheel of fettuccine with meat stock, goose meat, sultanas and pinenuts. Among other primi, the pappardelle con crema di cipolle, porcini e reggiano (pasta with onion sauce, porcini mushroom and parmesan) is excellent. Secondi include aliciotti con l'indivia (anchovies with endives), and vegetarians are well-served here too. Finish off with a plate of walnut-filled cannoncini alla romana biscuits. This is a working-class area of town where tourists rarely tread, but it is easily reached by metro. ...see and be seen Maccheroni Piazza delle Copelle 44 (06 6830 7895) Bus to Corso Rinascimento. Meals served: 1-3pm, 8pm-midnight Mon-Sat. Credit: AmEx, MC, V. This young, funky eaterie, which opened in 1998, is already an established favourite with trendy locals, visiting celebrities and actresses who are just about to make it big. In summer, tables spill out on to the pretty square. Inside, boathouse-style panelled walls and long marble counters separate the eating area from the open-to-view kitchens. The food is basic trattoria fare, served distractedly by young waiters. The antipasto selection of cold meats and cheeses is tasty enough, but if you are persuaded to order it 'for the whole table,' you will be charged for the whole table. As its name suggests, pasta is Maccheroni's forte: the torfie al tartufo nero (short pasta twists in truffle cream sauce) are heavenly, as is the gnocchi with pear and gorgonzola. The basic secondi can be disappointing; the only one that stands out is the mouth-watering grilled steak, either served whole or sliced on a bed of rocket. ...enjoy the view La Terrazza dell' Hotel Eden Via Ludovisi 49 (06 478 121). Bus to Via Veneto. Meals served: 12.30-2.30pm, 7.30-10.30pm daily. Credit: AmEx, DC, MC, V. One of Rome's most chic and expensive hotels - the Eden - houses one the city's most chic and expensive restaurants. True to its name, this rooftop eyrie offers a spectacular view of Rome's seven hills. In the warm weather, sit out on the pretty terrace; during the winter months, enjoy the discreet, elegant, minimalist decor which competes as little as possible with that widescreen vista. Enrico Derflingher, once Princess Diana's personal chef, has a mod-Med approach based on fresh flavourful dishes that shirk heavy sauces; the fegato d'anatra (duck's liver), in particular, is divine. If the price of a meal is out of your range, the attached bar is also an ideal place for a pre-dinner aperitivo. If you opt to throw frugality to the winds and eat, dinner reservations are essential. ...dine al fresco La Carbonara Campo de' Fiori 23 (06 686 4783). Bus to Corso Emanuele (Piazza della Cancelleria). Meals served: 12.30- 3pm, 7.30-11pm Mon, Wed- Sun. Closed for three weeks in August. Credit: AmEx, MC, V. At one end of Rome's most photogenic square, this place looks like a tourist trap. In fact this old trooper does surprisingly honest cucina romana, with traditional favourites like the spaghetti alla carbonara from which its name derives. The wine list and desserts are uninspired, but it's the setting that counts around here. Remember where you are, though, and keep an eye on your bag at outside tables. ...dine with history Costanza Piazza del Paradiso 63-5 (06 686 1717). Bus to via del Corso (Sant' Andrea della Valle). Meals served: 12.30-3pm, 7.30-11.30pm Mon- Sat. Closed for three weeks in August. Credit: AmEx, DC, MC, V. This is the kind of place your father might bring you to, in order to regale you with stories of what he got up to in Rome in the 1960s. Costanza has been around for years, but the premises have been around for even longer: the restaurant is built into the arches under the Teatro di Pompeo, which dates back to 60BC. Service is brisk but indulgent; the cuisine is based on the well-executed pan-Italian comfort food that brought your father here all those years ago. Don't miss the antipasti fritti- - a fill-you-up-before-you-starter that includes deep-fried mozzarella, fiori di zucca (courgette flowers), suppl\u00ec (rice balls) and crocchette di patate (mashed potato balls). The Roman Jewish tradition of the nearby ghetto is present in the house speciality, carciofi all guidia (deep-fried artichokes). Tasty pasta dishes include tagliolini ai moscardini con bottarga (long pasta strips with baby squid and fish roe) and the tegamino di gnocchi (spinach gnocchi baked in a tomato and cheese casserole). ...go vegetarian Margutta Vegeteriano Ristorante Via Margutta 118 (06 3265 0577). Metro Flamingo/ bus to piazza del Popolo. Meals served: 12.30-3.30pm, 7.30-11pm daily. Credit: DC, MC, V. Rome's historic vegetarian diner occupies a large plant-filled space on arty, exclusive Via Margutta. The decor pays homage to the area, with plenty of modern art. At lunch (Mon-Sat), a set-price one-plate buffet (10 euros with water and dessert) is an alternative to the more formal restaurant, which offers a meatless slant on modern Italian cuisine, with one or two oriental touches. On Sunday, the fixed-lunch menu is replaced by a filling all-you-can-eat 23 euros brunch. Do... \u00b7 Leave a tip of no less than 5% and no more than 10%. \u00b7 Take children even to the smartest restaurants. \u00b7 Ask for a mezze porzioni (half portions) for children. \u00b7 Book a table in advance - even in places that might appear to be spit and sawdust. \u00b7 Keep an eye on your bag at outside tables/if dining al fresco. Don't... \u00b7 Feel obliged to order a fixed number of courses. \u00b7 Be ashamed to check the bill in detail. \u00b7 Leave without taking your receipt - you can incur a fine. \u00b7 Assume you can use cards or travellers' cheques. \u00b7 Eat reheated surface-of-Mars discs that congeal outside tourist bars - proper pizza should be rolled and baked as you wait. \u00b7 The Time Out Eating &amp; Drinking Guide to Rome is published by Penguin Books.
