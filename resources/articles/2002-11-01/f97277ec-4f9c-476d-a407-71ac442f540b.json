Johnson's clinical finish close to half-time complimented an earlier strike from partner-in-crime Marlon Harewood to emphasise the gulf in class that exists between two teams operating at different ends of the First Division spectrum. It seems churlish to criticise Forest's potency in front of goal given the fact that between them, Johnson and Harewood have hit the back of the net 24 times, but late strikes from Steve Sidwell and Nathan Jones almost did enough to make Paul Hart's team pay for some earlier misses in a first half when they ran riot. Steve Coppell's side were protecting an unbeaten run of four games but this never looked like being extended. Forest surrendered an unbeaten run of 11 league games themselves at Molineux last weekend and had to make amends. The home side stamped their class on proceedings from the start and could have been three goals to the good within 15 minutes. Harewood showed his flourishing skills with a weaving run past two startled defenders but his dangerous cross failed to be converted by Jack Lester. Moments later Forest took a deserved lead when Johnson raced clear of Danny Cullip courtesy of David Prutton's pass but saw his powerful shot well saved by Michel Kuipers. Harewood reacted first to drill the ball through Kuipers for his sixth goal of the season. Lester was the next to threaten and should have doubled his side's advantage but with just Kuipers to beat he chipped over the crossbar with embarrassing extravagance when a simple finish would have sufficed. Chances continued to be wasted by Forest. Johnson headed wide from point-blank range, Riccardo Scimeca's hopeful shot almost squirmed through the legs of Kuipers and Harewood was denied by the Brighton goalkeeper when he should have scored but the profligacy was forgotten on the stroke of half time when Johnson swept home . The pressure on Brighton's flimsy defence was unrelenting. Matthieu Louis-Jean, Harewood and Lester all missed good chances before on 76 minutes Lester flung himself at Prutton's cross to direct a firm header past Kuipers at the far post. Remarkably Forest were left hanging on, but a point would have been woefully unfair on Forest who now have their east Midlands rivals Leicester City in their sights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
