Displaying more than 50 works from an international selection of artists, and including new commissions from local ones, the collection revels in the strangeness that can be provoked in the \u201climinal\u201d territory between precise replication, and artistic fantasy. The procession of rooms showcase the development of the genre, a movement that was birthed by the inventions of new artistic technologies in the 1960s and 1970s. George Segal\u2019s early casts of human figures posed in interrupted acts of casual ordinariness are here, as are Duane Hanson\u2019s poignantly suburban Woman With a Laundry Basket from 1974 and Two Workers from 1993. But the combination of sophisticated new sculptural materials as well as evolving digital rendering techniques have enabled artists motivated to explore both the subject and form of the human body\u2019s surface with ever greater detail. Australians would perhaps be most familiar with the obsessive verisimilitude of locally born sculptor Ron Mueck, through works such as his iconic Pregnant Woman and Wild Man, both of which appear here. Individual hairs have been sewn into skins that seem to ripple with intense, inner dramas, both of impending movement and characterisations. Mueck\u2019s distortions of scale oblige viewers to remember that these are works of art, not anatomy; and to observe bodily humanity in both enlarged and reduced new contexts. Mueck\u2019s works have been some of the most popular within the NGA\u2019s pre-existing collection, as have Melbourne artist Patricia Piccinini\u2019s, also featured here. Exhibition curator Jak Babington admits there\u2019s no denying the genre\u2019s appeal. \u201cGerman company IKA put together a hyper-realistic sculpture exhibition that toured Spain, Germany and Denmark,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe thought, let\u2019s take a component of that show and bring it here, and celebrate the Australian practitioners at the centre of that exhibition.\u201d Australian Artist Sam Jinks, who, like Mueck, has a professional background in film effects, was commissioned by the gallery for new work for Hyper Real. For Jinks, it\u2019s the accessibility and familiarity of the hyper real that explains its popularity, creating a visual access point that travels \u201cfast, straight to the lizard brain\u201d. There\u2019s a thrill to be found in the uncertainty of whether something is alive or an object. \u201cFrom the corner of the eye, a mannequin in a room feels like another presence,\u201d Jinks explains. His own contributions render precise sculptural replications of humanity in poses borrowed from Renaissance art. His triumphant contribution of a pieta in the tradition of Raphael \u2013 wherein an elderly woman provides comfort to a naked, ailing young man \u2013 is something of a secular masterpiece. The naturalism of Hyper Real\u2019s first half transitions into the realism of the fantastic for its second. Piccinini\u2019s fantastical human hybrids have been placed at the centre as a deliberate \u201ctipping point\u201d between the two. Piccinini\u2019s Bootflower creature has a room of its own, and while there\u2019s an alarming grotesqueness to it \u2013 the still and silent shitting of eggs from below its fleshy, faceless bloom \u2013 nothing in Bootflower disquiets as much as the puckering biological orifices of her accompanying video installation, The Breathing Room. It\u2019s only one of a number of works whose play between the real and imagined provokes an unsettling response. The frozen head of British artist Marc Quinn is rendered in the artist\u2019s own blood, suspended in refrigeration. Fascist salutes erupt from a ceiling, and from Chinese art duo Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, a room full of retired authoritarians in self-animated mechanical wheelchairs buzz and collide, seemingly at their own discretion. Australian artist Ronnie Van Hout\u2019s smoking, drinking, pyjama-wearing child-adults on toilets delivers the precise kind of \u201ccreepy and weird\u201d vibe the artist admits to me has fascinated him since his own liminal adolescence. But creepier and weirder, if not in as good a way, is Paul McCarthy\u2019s contribution of a sculptural triptych of a naked young woman with a splayed vulva. As a rendering of his muse, actor Elyse Poppers, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein revelations, there\u2019s a reluctance you can read into her hesitating, receptive pose and uncomfortable expression that perhaps now disturbs more than anything else in the exhibition. A panoramic film created by Russian art collective AES+F, Inverso Mundus concludes the parade: a spectacular immersion in the digital realisation of humanity in advantage, disadvantage and inversion. Liberated from the disappointingly poky confines \u2013 which do really limit the visual impact of the work in the preceding NGA gallery space \u2013 the operatic exuberance of the work is given room to truly exist \u201cbeyond\u201d the real, on its own mesmerising terms. \u2022 Hyper Real is exhibiting at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra until 18 February 2018"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
