The Everton captain visited a surgeon in Manchester yesterday and it was confirmed he suffered posterior cruciate ligament damage in a challenge with Fulham's Dickson Etuhu on Sunday. He does not, though, require an operation. \"I would like to know if those tackles that can danger a player are acceptable now?\" Moyes said yesterday. Neville's absence leaves Everton short of options both at right-back and in central midfield for their Group I opener against AEK Athens, given that Tony Hibbert is suspended and new signing John Heitinga ineligible. Moyes confirmed he is considering handing Bilyaletdinov a first start since his \u00a39m arrival from Lokomotiv Moscow. Dan Gosling is expected to deputise for Hibbert at right-back. \"Guus Hiddink told me a lot about Everton before I joined,\" said Bilyaletdinov, a left midfielder. \"He said it was one of the teams that impressed him greatly when he was at Chelsea and I feel I have been given a lucky ticket to be here.\" Everton (4-4-1-1, probable): Howard; Gosling, Yobo, Distin, Baines; Pienaar, Rodwell, Cahill, Bilyaletdinov; Fellaini, Saha. Subs from: Nash, Coleman, Garbutt, Duffy, Mustafi, Osman, Wallace, Akpan, J\u00f4, Vaughan, Yakubu, Agard, Baxter. AEK Athens (4-3-3, probable): Saja; Araujo, Geraldo, Jahic, Juanfran; Kafes, Makos, Nsaliwa; Scocco, Blanco, Leonardo. Subs from: Arabatzis, Majstorovic, Karabelas, Georgeas, Arce, Hersi, Manduca, Yahaya, Tachtsidis, Gentzoglou, Pavlis, Iordache, Nemeth.
