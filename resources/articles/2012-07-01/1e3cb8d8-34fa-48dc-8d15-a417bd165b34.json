Great sports stars such as Steve Redgrave, Michael Johnson, Seb Coe have carried it. As have less athletic types, among them the pop star and television celebrity will.i.am, in Taunton of all places, and the Jedward twins in their home city of Dublin. But, in the end, it was always the \"ordinary\" people who stole the torch relay show. The thousands of non-celebs who were nominated by their own communities for work that is not usually recognised publicly. Take Brenda Heys, a 49-year-old mother of two boys, put forward for her work for the West Berkshire Down's Syndrome Group. She explained how she had tried to convince organisers to let her run with her two boys, Piers, nine, and Joshua, four, who both have the condition. She worried that Locog was not going to give her permission. \"We thought they were going to have to run outside the cordon. At the last moment one of the policewomen told me to grab the boys. It was spontaneous, absolutely amazing.\" To huge cheers, Heys, the boys and the policewoman ran hand-in-hand on one of the Reading legs. \"The only problem now is that the boys want to keep running down every road they come across,\" said Heys. By the time the flame reaches the Olympic stadium a week today, 8,000 torchbearers will have carried it through more than 1,000 communities. The idea was to make sure the flame got to within 10 miles of 95% of the UK population and already, before it has even reached the capital, organisers say about 10 million people have seen it. There will have been 66 formal evening celebrations, communities coming together to mark the flame's arrival. But countless other informal gatherings, sports events, cake sales and barbecues have been organised by those who wanted to join the party. The journey began in Cornwall in May where 185,000 people (about a third of the population) turned out. Malcolm Bell, of Visit Cornwall, estimates it was worth about \u00a316m in free publicity. \"It created a buzz about the games. For most people, the torch is the closest they will get to the Olympics.\" More than 600 miles north, the crowds also lined the streets when the torch arrived in Orkney. \"We were worried it might be a bit of a damp squib,\" admitted Steven Heddle, the leader of Orkney Islands council. There was no need for such concerns: about 2,000 people were on Broad Street in the main town of Kirkwall when the torch passed. \"Folk took it to heart,\" said Heddle. Thanks to years of diplomatic talks, the torch briefly left the UK for Dublin. \"We're a sports-mad nation and this is essentially a home Olympics for us,\" said Jack McGouran, spokesman for the Olympic Council of Ireland. Certainly, this has not just been an event for Britons; scores of torch-bearers were \"global citizens\". American-born Tanya Lubicz-Nawrocka carried the torch in Cambridge. She said that for her, the games were about the world coming together to celebrate sport and life. It has not even just been for humans. In Peterborough, Lyn Hobson, was allowed to take her rabbit, Crystal, on her leg of the relay. \"She comes with me everywhere and she sulks if she's left at home,\" said Hobson. \"The only problem was she got more attention than me.\" Of course, there have been a few sticky moments: a streaker in Oxfordshire, a political protest against a Hungarian man in Dorset, a string of minor security alerts. And many people criticise the commercial aspects of the relay. Wherever the torch goes, so do the representatives of the \"presenting partners\": fizzy drink, phone and banking multinationals. There has been criticism of those who tried to sell on their torches, which runners can buy for \u00a3199. Sarah Milner Simonds hit the headlines when her torch appeared to have sold for \u00a3150,000 on eBay. It turned out to have been a hoax and when the Guardian contacted her this week, she said the torch was lying next to her on the sofa. She had planned to donate her profits to charity and was shocked at finding herself in the spotlight. \"I still feel shaken by what happened,\" she said. But why have so many people embraced the torch? David Wilson, a professor at Birmingham City University and commentator on social affairs, said the country had clearly changed since the last time London held an Olympics in 1948. \"It's far less hierarchical, far less stiff upper lip.\" The sort of people who carried the torch made people warm to it, Wilson believes. \"It has not just been great sports people and very high achievers. It is people who have done something good in their community. \"The public can feel more connected to the event in a way they would not feel if it had just been about the celebration of sport.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
