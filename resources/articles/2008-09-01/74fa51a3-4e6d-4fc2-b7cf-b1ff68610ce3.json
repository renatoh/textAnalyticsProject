Introduced on stage as both \"a legend\" and \"the king\", he is a key figure in the history of Congolese music, and a showman whose soukous dance songs echoed across Africa in the 1980s and 90s. As the closing act in this year's London African Music festival, he had to prove he is better live than on his latest, sub-standard album - and can still get a concert hall dancing. He succeeded, while keeping to a predictable routine. His four-piece guitar band came on stage first - with, thankfully, no sign of the album's keyboard player - and started with lilting rumba, featuring impressive solos from his backing singers, including a charming revival of Mbilia Bel's Nakei Nairobi. Then on he came, a portly figure in his trademark wide-brimmed hat and a garish white and orange shirt, treating his first song as if it were the finale. Suddenly the tempo had increased, and his band and singers joined him to form a line across the front of the stage, waving their hands in a frantic dance workout. And so it continued, with little change to the party mood or musical format, as Kanda Bongo Man led different combinations of singers and dancers through various routines. There were no surprises, but at least his easygoing, gently rousing voice, and his flamboyant image, remained intact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
