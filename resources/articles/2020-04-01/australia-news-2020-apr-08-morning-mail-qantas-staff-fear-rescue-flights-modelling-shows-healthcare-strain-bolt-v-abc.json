Coronavirus Qantas staff are \u201cincredibly fearful\u201d about flights to rescue Australians trapped overseas, forcing the airline to turn to its staff in New Zealand after it failed to get enough Australian cabin crew to volunteer. With news that 50 Qantas and Jetstar staff have contracted coronavirus there has been growing anxiety among Qantas staff about plans to resume flights to Los Angeles, London, Auckland and Hong Kong this week. The government has released modelling showing the strain that would be placed on the Australian health system without strict lockdown procedures. Some 35,000 intensive care beds could be required at the pandemic\u2019s peak \u2013 well beyond capacity. The government also confirmed that Covid-19 patients would be given the controversial anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials. Donald Trump has touted the drug as a cure or preventative for Covid-19 but scientists have warned it can cause severe and even life-threatening side-effects. Boris Johnson remains in a stable condition in intensive care and is not on a ventilator. The UK\u2019s stand-in prime minister, Dominic Raab, told reporters he thought Johnson would pull through because he is a fighter. In the same media conference, Raab suggested the UK\u2019s lockdown would be extended, saying the country was not yet at the point where the government could review restrictions. The UK added 854 people to the Covid-19 death toll on Tuesday, as a study predicted the country would have Europe\u2019s worst coronavirus death toll. In Europe as a whole, deaths rose above 50,000 but some countries including Denmark and Norway have started to ease lockdown measures. Meanwhile in Turkey, the infection rate is rising faster than anywhere else in the world. President Recep Tayip Erdo\u011fan has refused to order a lockdown. The effect of coronavirus on Australian businesses has been revealed, with a study showing that two-thirds of businesses across all sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to Covid-19. A staggering 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector have been forced to reduce the hours of their staff. Australians remain convinced of the government\u2019s response though, with the number of people trusting official advice rising to 63%, according to the Guardian Essential poll. Trust in the media to provide honest and objective information about Covid-19 jumped from 35% to 51% over the same two-week period. Donald Trump was warned of the devastating impact of Covid-19 in January, before going on to downplay the threat of the virus. Memos written by Trump\u2019s economic adviser Peter Navarro gave a worst-case scenario of 500,000 deaths. Trump, whose fortune has declined by a $1bn due to stock market crashes, showed more pressing concern for Boris Johnson, asking an unnamed group of pharmaceutical CEOs to offer the UK prime minister experimental coronavirus drugs. He said a team of scientists was already in the UK. Australia The ABC has backed its journalists\u2019 reporting of the George Pell case as the News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt claims the organisation conducted a witch hunt. \u201cThe ABC has \u2013 and will continue to \u2013 report accurately and without fear or favour on stories that are in the public interest, including this one,\u201d a spokesperson said.

Recommended reads George Pell\u2019s quashed conviction for child sex offences is a triumph for the former cardinal, but it will be accompanied by a storm of rage from his supporters, writes David Marr. \u201cThe [high court has] done what the jury and the Victorian court of appeal did not do: they have trusted absolutely the evidence of Pell\u2019s master of ceremonies Monsignor Charles Portelli.\u201d And soon we will see the royal commission\u2019s verdict \u201con the career that took a Ballarat priest who noticed so little about these crimes on his home turf all the way to the highest echelons of the Vatican\u201d.
