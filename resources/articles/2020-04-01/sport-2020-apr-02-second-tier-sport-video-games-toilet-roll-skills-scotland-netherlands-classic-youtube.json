Or, indeed, to check out some that are \u2026 less classic. Sure, there\u2019s Sensible World of Soccer and Fifa, but there\u2019s also Tehkan World Cup \u2013 play it here \u2026 and Kick And Run \u2026 and Dream Soccer \u201994 or indeed Alpha Denshi\u2019s Exciting Soccer from 1983. If you still have Flash, Roby Baggio\u2019s Magical Kicks is willing and able to distract you for whole evenings and weekends (if not, here\u2019s a clip) \u2026 failing that, there\u2019s always Nihon\u2019s Free Kick. Nevermind NBA Jam and Arch Rivals, here\u2019s Street Hoop (aka Dunk Dream), All-American Basketball on the Speccy and the Master System\u2019s decidedly ungreat Great Basketball. Forget Pole Position, Virtua Racing and Super Sprint, the cool cats are all about Tail To Nose: Great Championship. And Road Rash is all well and good, but don\u2019t forget Kick Rider and Alex Kidd\u2019s BMX Trial. Don\u2019t dig out World Class Leaderboard, Links, Golden Tee and Sensible Golf \u2026 instead here\u2019s Major Title, Greg Norman\u2019s Shark Attack \u2026 Lee Trevino\u2019s Fighting Golf \u2026 or have a swing at the Atari 2600\u2019s My Golf. Punch Out is the most memorable arcade boxing game, but here\u2019s Ring King, KO Punch, and George Foreman\u2019s KO Boxing, the latter featuring our hero gorging on hamburgers between rounds to up his energy levels. Tennis heads may fondly recall Pete Sampras Tennis, but here\u2019s Passing Shot and Playmark\u2019s Super Slam. The John Madden series gets the plaudits from American football lovers, but Tehkan\u2019s Gridiron Fight is worth a look, as is John Elway\u2019s Team Quarterback \u2026 or go seriously retro with the medieval-themed Pigskin. Finally, forget Konami\u2019s Track &amp; Field and Hyper Sports for your button-mashing and joystick-waggling \u2026 try Brian Jacks Superstar Challenge \u2026 or indeed Geoff Capes\u2019s Strongman Challenge 2) More retro fun: to accompany our recent MBM of Scotland\u2019s famous 1978 win over the Netherlands, here are some highlights. And you\u2019ll be wanting some half-time analysis too (one minute in) including Jimmy Hill, Jock Stein and Billy Bremner. While on Tuesday we revisited Manchester United\u2019s famous fightback against Juventus in 1999. Here\u2019s the key action. 3) The virtual Grand National takes place this weekend, in lieu of an actual Aintree event (gamers can saddle up Diamond Derby instead). Tiger Roll\u2019s hopes of a third successive win were scuppered by the race\u2019s cancellation \u2013 catch up with his first and second respectively. 4) Toilet-roll keepie-uppies etc from footballers on lockdown, and Kenny Dalglish attempts to show he still has it, with mixed though watchable results. 5) Second-rower Mick Cassidy takes the ball for Wigan against Australia in a Central Park \u201cfriendly\u201d in 1994, gets absolutely clattered by Ian Roberts, but brushes it off fuss-free to get up and play the ball. Another friendly rumpus here too: Les Boyd v Ellery Hanley during the 1989 Warrington v Wigan meeting in Milwaukee. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Benjamin Massing\u2019s infamous assault on Argentina\u2019s Claudio Caniggia at Italia 90. 2) Skydiving: the sheer intensity of a flying suit basejump. 3) More vintage Johan Cruyff, for Ajax. And Jan Molby on the Dutch master\u2019s last game. 4) And another legend, this time in NFL \u2013 Tom Brady. Here\u2019s SuperBowl 51 in full, and some of Brady\u2019s less memorable moments. 5) The brilliant and underrated Dejan Savicevic. 6) One for Sunderland fans: the 1973 FA Cup final in full.
