So why is it that the nation doesn't love Barry Bonds no matter how many records he breaks?", "bodyText": "Americans have no sporting equivalent to the role of the England captain, but there are two positions that have taken on something of the iconic status: the football quarterback and the baseball slugger. President Teddy Roosevelt's famous advice, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick', is often cited as the logic behind American foreign policy. The proverb was originally African, but it makes another kind of sense in the land of Babe Ruth. The big stick is his baseball bat. Home-run hitters (with the exception of Ruth himself, who never seemed to lose his baby fat) look like superheroes: on their firmly planted feet, with their narrow, flexible waists and huge arms and shoulders. Baseball is a sport based on fear: on the fear of the hundred-mile-an-hour fastball and the courage of a big man carrying a big stick trying to hit it. George Herman Ruth Jr was America's original superstar. He played the country's first homegrown sport, baseball, at a time when big business had just grasped its marketing potential - in the 'roaring' aftermath of the First World War. The Babe played his part in that, too. The ease with which he hit home runs turned baseball's most exciting play into a legitimate tactic. Opposing teams learned their lesson. Finesse in the sport gave way to power, both as a means and an end as teams stopped looking just to move players gradually round the bases. Ruth began life as a pitcher and won a couple of World Series with the Boston Red Sox, both with bat and ball, before his off-field antics and salary demands forced a trade. The 'Curse of the Bambino' is the reason, Red Sox fans traditionally claim, that Boston went without a World Series for the rest of the century; the trade ushered in the heyday of the most successful franchise in American sports, the New York Yankees. In the process, he set records that had to be created just to describe his magnificence. Even baseball's passion for statistics could hardly keep pace with Ruth. His excesses, on and off the field, seemed really just the largest expression of his appetite for life. He slept around and drank too much beer, but the sporting press, at the time, was willing to forgive what it could also admire. The past few years have taken a toll on the reputation of the slugger. The great home-run chases of the 1990s have been tarnished by steroid scandals. Baseball, famously, is the sport that doesn't change, but the game's historians like to think in terms of eras. This has been a record-breaking era, but it's more likely to be remembered for the 'juice' that, rumour has it, helped the sluggers break them. Balco, a San Francisco sports nutrition company, lies at the heart of the rumours. The Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative allegedly supplied a number of Olympic athletes, NFL and baseball stars with untraceable steroids. It is still under federal investigation. Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, two reporters from the San Francisco Chronicle, the paper that broke the story, have recently published a book, Game of Shadows, that includes details of the testimony of star athletes. The book has created a sensation. The star at the centre of the storm, the baseball player Barry Bonds, sued the journalists for leaking his testimony in front of a grand jury; and the Chronicle reporters themselves have been subpoenaed to testify before it. Bonds, though he maintains he has never knowingly taken steroids, has just dropped his lawsuit, claiming to be satisfied. Baseball, in response, has finally begun to test players for drugs. But the horses have bolted - most of the records have already fallen. Except one. The biggest of them all is Hank Aaron's total for career home runs. With an almost tragic inevitability, an ageing and unloved Barry Bonds has been trundling towards the record line. Let's go back a decade. It might be best for various reasons (one of them legal) simply to imagine the dilemma. Let's imagine a baseball player - one of the best, most broadly gifted of his generation: with a quick, strong bat; fleet feet; a perfect eye. He's won plenty of games and his share of awards; he's a certainty for the Hall of Fame but has never won a championship. As he begins to fade out of his prime, he sees the stiffs and hulks who were fading with him take on new life, break unbreakable records and attract a frenzy of admiration. He thinks he knows the secret of their newly powerful hitting: steroids. There's no chance of getting caught. (The drugs aren't even, in baseball, illegal.) But there is a chance, a real chance, that if he takes them he could become one of the greatest batsmen in history. What we have to imagine, really, is the price he would pay. It isn't just a question of his integrity. It isn't even a question of his health, though he might, in the end, suffer the most on that front. His testes will shrink as his body shuts down production of its own testosterone. Sexual dysfunction might follow. His hair will fall out, to be replaced, in a fashion, on his back by a harvest of acne. The shape of his face, not just his body, will change: the line of his jaw will thicken and protrude. The shape of his personality will suffer its own metamorphosis: his temper will shorten and begin, suddenly, to veer. He will feel himself, more and more, giving in to frustration and violence. The shape of his relations, with lovers and team-mates and family, will begin to change. The bulging of his body will be matched by the awkward swelling in his personality, against which everyone around him will be forced to make space. He will begin to suffer most, perhaps, for the berth he has been given. An ambitious man can accept all this. 'The true artist,' George Bernard Shaw once said, 'will let his wife starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for his living at 70, sooner than work at anything but his art.' Maybe the best that can be said of the superstar father is that no one goes hungry. But the strangest sacrifice of all is the constriction of his own athletic gifts. Baseball, coaches like to say, is a simple game: you throw the ball, you catch the ball, you hit the ball. In between, you run. But the bulk of steroids, for the most part, helps you only to hit the ball. It doesn't help you to chase down a well struck ball as it steeples away into the outfield; or climb the outfield wall to pull back a home-run shot; or beat out the short-stop's throw on a ground ball. The difference, you might say, between a game and a test is that games have wriggle-room: for defying orthodoxies, for invention, for the play of instinct. Games measure gifts that express themselves, among other ways, as joy. One of the odd effects of steroids on a baseball player is that they help him to improve most the skills that can be most simply tested. What steroids bulk out, above all, is statistics: the rate at which you hit the ball, and the ratio of those hits that turn out to be home runs. This is what baseball statisticians (and there are many of them) turn into the slugging percentage. Baseball is rich in statistics and abbreviations: earned run averages, on base percentages and runs batted in become ERAs, OBPs and RBIs. It has grown poorer in the spaces between them. Steroids are the drug of choice only for a culture of targets. After the public relations disaster of the 1994 players' strike, Major League Baseball needed targets. The game had been interrupted mid-season, in August, in the last breathless run-up to the play-offs. For the first time since World War One, the finals had been cancelled; and the next season began, in the spring of 1995, two weeks late. Bill Clinton himself had to step in; the President didn't see why a few hundred people couldn't find a way to split several billion dollars. Fans more or less shared his opinion. Attendance was down and stayed down. People needed a new reason to come out to the park. They needed a reason they could read about in the papers, or talk about with strangers: something more concrete than the joy of the game. The baseball season is long, running from spring to October. By July most fans know their teams are out of the hunt; there's no threat of relegation to keep them interested in losing. People go to the ballpark not because the games matter, but because the game does. It's a way of life; but the way of life had been interrupted and baseball could no longer rely on the pleasantness of habit to put fans in the seats. What they needed was an argument, something to fight for and worry over, game after game, in the summer heart of the season. What they needed was a home-run chase; and then, in 1998, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa gave it to them. It was almost perfect: a battle between the jolly white giant and the jolly black joker. McGwire was the giant, a slugger for the St Louis Cardinals, red-bearded, with a giant's strange soft voice and gentleness. Sosa was the clown of the Chicago Cubs: impish, smiling, with a home-run dance that included, as he rounded the bases, a tap of his heart, to honour his mother. Both players rose suddenly, not from obscurity, but from the broad strata, just below stardom, of unfulfilled potential. Fulfilment made them unimaginably better. Babe Ruth set his first home-run record in 1919, knocking in 29 to eclipse a 35-year-old mark by two. This was the sort of respect the game's records demanded; but in the next eight years, the Babe showed none for his own. He became the first man to hit 30, 40 and 50 home runs in a season, then in 1927 he stroked in 60. That mark stood for more than three decades and when it was broken, in 1961, the wrong man broke it. Roger Maris was supposed to play the foil to his famous Yankee team-mate, Mickey Mantle; Mantle was the greater player - some would say, the greatest talent that ever played the game - but it was Maris, a tight-lipped, awkward man, uncomfortable in the media spotlight, who knocked in 61 in '61; and Mantle whose taste for good times ushered in his own decline. For the next 37 years, nobody cracked 60, until 1998, when Sosa and McGwire staged their home-run derby. Sosa ended up with 66, McGwire with 70, including five off his last 11 at bats - the equivalent, roughly, of ending a football season on a pair of hat-tricks. Bonds felt the wrong man had got the record again. At that time, Bonds was already, according to the Sporting News, one of the hundred greatest players in history and the best still active. He grew up in the glare of baseball celebrity; his father was an all-star player; his godfather was the great Willie Mays; but Bonds managed to live up to his antecedents. He even played for his father's old club, the San Francisco Giants. He could hit for power and he could hit for percentage; he had speed on the bases and a wonderful arm. Once, in his minor league days in Pittsburgh, he played all nine positions. These talents had been reflected in awards rather than championships: three National League most valuable player titles, countless appearances in the annual All-Stars game against the American League and eight gold gloves, for excellence in the field. That spring, Fainaru-Wada and Williams write, he felt for the first time in his life the sting of justified envy. He had always, he believed, been better than McGwire, but one of the awful truths about baseball is the simplicity of its measurement. In 1998 McGwire put together one of the best slugging seasons in history. The numbers proved it: he knocked in almost a run a game and landed on base nearly every other at-bat. In a sport based on failure, he made a norm of success; and turned the rarity of a home run into an everyday occurrence. But there were ways to undermine the numbers. Conspiracy theories sprang up. A reporter waiting for a showering McGwire noticed a bottle of 'androstenedione' in his locker. He looked it up; it turned out to be a nutritional supplement that was supposed to boost testosterone levels. It was legal in baseball, though most sports had banned it. Almost everything was legal in baseball. The league couldn't afford to look too closely in their lockers. They might not have survived another scandal. Bonds, according to Game of Shadows, had his own conspiracy theory. McGwire was bound to beat out Sosa because the league would never let a black man break the record of Ruth and Maris. There's no doubt that racism (or patriotism; Sosa is Dominican) played a part in the media coverage of their home-run chase, in the subtle prominence given to McGwire. But the prejudice that matters more, that has endured, has nothing to do with race. The feeling now is that all of them were juiced; and it's the feeling, argue Fainaru-Wada and Williams, that rankled in Bonds himself as he watched McGwire outshine him in his own ballpark one weekend in May 1998. That, allegedly, is the moment he decided to try steroids. Steroids make strange bedfellows. They bring together the ambitious at either end of the spectrum: stars, to whom everything has always come easily; and wannabes, with no talent but their drive. Weightlifting sells self-transformation: you can be good at it by trying. Why stop short of artificial enhancements? Artifice is the name of the game. You lift weights to turn your body into a new thing - a thing unlike your old body. It attracts people who are dissatisfied with their physiques and it attracts, from time to time, natural athletes who had never for a moment worried about the gifts they were born with. Until something happens to make them worry: decline, or the rise of their peers. This, at least, is the story Game of Shadows tells about Bonds. The workout guru he hired was Greg Anderson, a 5ft 10in gym rat who saw himself mostly as an instructor. He lived hand to mouth and slept, Bonds liked to joke, wherever he had parked his truck. Anderson dealt drugs, the book alleges, practically for cost, sourced sometimes from San Francisco Aids patients who preferred cash to the human growth hormone they had been prescribed to help them rebuild their muscle mass. It would be interesting to track, from patient to superstar, the journey those drugs are supposed to have taken. Anderson, whether he was dealing or not, makes an interesting contrast to Bonds. Effort is what he dealt in and taught, and effortlessness was Bonds's inheritance. He starred in every sport he put his hand to at high school; it was only a question of time before he entered the family business: baseball. Barry soon learned he could win without trying: 'Everything was easy for me, all sports, when I was a kid. I'd work half as hard as other kids did and I was better. Why work when I had so much ability?' Another question he might have asked himself is: why play nice? Managers coddled him for his talent and he eased into superstardom without the correcting influence of a need to be liked. Only mediocre players want to be good sports. Athletes succeed because they're quick to learn what they can offer a team; and those without other striking talents can offer at least their ability to get along with their team-mates. There's a morality to teamsmanship that can strike many sensible sportsmen as oppressive. Marginal players are sometimes kept on, because the lesson they preach is useful, even if it isn't true. The team, they insist, come first; though everyone knows that it's the players who get paid. We should consider Bonds's reputation for surliness in this light. 'I never saw a team-mate that cared about him,' his college coach Jim Brock once said. 'Part of it would be his being rude, inconsiderate and self-centred... I don't think he ever figured out what to do to get people to like him.' Brock once kicked Bonds off the team to teach him a lesson. He held a locker-room vote, on whether their best player should be allowed to return. The other guys, he figured, might enjoy the feeling of lording it over their star for once. Brock had to make them vote twice: nobody wanted him back. Perhaps the most damning testimony was provided by his former mistress Kimberly Bell, who claimed in Game of Shadows that Bonds once threatened to kill her. Stardom allowed Bonds to indulge his talent for isolation, which he practised, it must be said, even outside the clubhouse. 'My grandmother,' he once told a reporter from the New York Times magazine, 'wants me to get her some wheelchair that drives like a car. Why do I need to get her some wheelchair when she's gonna die anyway?' ('The true artist... will let his mother drudge etc.') Baseball, as a sport, encourages individualism: batters face their opposition alone. And baseball allows each player his own private measures of success: batting averages, slugging percentages and, of course, home runs. One thing that can be said without any 'allegedlys' is that Bonds achieved an extraordinary measure of success. If the price was steroid use, we might at least grant him what he paid for. He became the greatest hitter of all time. He broke McGwire's home-run record in 2001, with 73. For a moment he enjoyed the fanfare for which he had envied the St Louis slugger. It could be measured in money. Fans fought over his historic home-run balls; they were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars as memorabilia. A cottage industry of kayak rentals sprang up, in the bay outside Bonds's home park. On game days, people paddled around in McCovey Cove, in case he knocked a long ball over the right field fence, into the water. 'Splash hits', they were called. For a season, he had no rivals. His numbers were unworldly. Baseball, traditionally, gives the edge to the pitcher. Bonds took it back. Nobody dared to throw him anything he could hit - the bowlers, as it were, bowled him nothing but wides. They are 'balls' in baseball terms - pitches that don't cross home plate. Four of them earn the batsman a free walk to first base. His batting, in response, had a kind of minimalist beauty: he rarely swung. He gave to each at-bat the appearance not just of power and control, but of perfectly exercised choice. Yet there's something a little tragic about these achievements. None of the great sluggers of that era won championships; their successes were personal. Bonds is no exception. He came closest in 2002, and batted beautifully in the World Series, but one of his fielding errors allowed opponents the Anaheim Angels to rally. The San Francisco Giants lost in seven games. Even his home-run record came too late. By the time he surpassed McGwire, the frenzy had begun to die down. There were rumours of steroids and records, like whisky, grow better with age. McGwire's was only three years old. For what it's worth, Bonds has just passed a much older one. Babe Ruth's mark of career home runs was broken on 28 May, without fanfare. Ruth himself is a reminder of both the good and the bad that has happened to American culture since he knocked in the last of his 714 home runs. The only performance-enhancing drugs he might have taken were hot dogs and beer; but he also played against an opposition enfeebled by racism. He faced only white pitchers. Hank Aaron, as he chased Ruth's record, faced death threats and a campaign of racist hate-mail. Bonds, no doubt, feels similarly beleaguered - he has been booed this season in every stadium but his own. But the racism of the 1970s has given way, perhaps, to a more justified outrage - against the perceived perversion of the sport. Bonds now has only Aaron left to beat; but age, a bad knee and - another allegedly - the advent of drug-testing have begun to catch up with him. At this rate it will take him two more years and the next milestone he reaches will be his 42nd birthday, this month. He's limping to the finish and nobody is much interested in seeing him get there. A reality TV series, Bonds on Bonds, has just been cancelled. Whether motivated by envy or not, he became an even better hitter than McGwire; still, one can't help feeling that he missed the time for it. Does it matter? Baseball carries on. It has survived worse scandals, including the fixed World Series of 1919. Is the fuss over steroids out of proportion to the crime being investigated? Steroids are barely illegal. Nobody has gone to jail and no one is likely to. The personal cost of taking them, both physical and emotional, could be enormous, of course. Athletes, more than most people, live on their pride. Users would be forced to lie, publicly and privately, about their most cherished achievements. Self-doubts must creep in. The relation they feel - always tenuous, one may suppose, in famous people - to the things they have done and can do would grow weaker and weaker. That, of course, is just the relation that has grown weaker in their fans. Who should we root for: the players, or the doctors who come up with their drug regimens? In time, we may learn to think of the scientists as we think of race-car engineers. Team Bonds - Balco, Greg Anderson, the works - could just be baseball's version of Team McLaren. There's a kind of fan, perfectly reasonable, who hopes that that time comes soon. Let's see what the human individual is capable of, with a little tinkering. It isn't just a question of the gifts an athlete is born with, his passion for the sport, his appetite for training; but also, let's say, his amenability to the medication. Steroids have been inevitable, really, since the professional began to outplay the amateur. Sports are supposed to encourage our purest striving. They represent capitalism, the struggle for success, in all its beautiful simplicity. The steroid-fuelled Olympic programs of the Soviet bloc became the symbol, in the West, of their faceless cultural machine. It isn't yet clear what Barry Bonds and the other home-run kings will be remembered for. What's strange is that it might not be their home runs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
