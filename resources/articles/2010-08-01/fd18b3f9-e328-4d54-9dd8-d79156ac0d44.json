The man once described as England's best manager since Sir Alf Ramsey has, almost overnight, become the biggest loser since Charlie Brown. The truth, probably, rests somewhere in between. Capello is being lampooned because of a particularly badly run World Cup campaign but even more so because of the aching disappointment and anti-climax experienced by a nation whose hopes had been ridiculously high in the first place. And now the Football Association is revealed as being just as daft as the punters who actually put money on England to win the pot in the summer. The next manager of England, we have been told, will be English. The FA has had a bit of a chinwag and, according to Adrian Bevington, the managing director of Club England, the decision has been taken two years before any appointment will be made. \"The view of everyone in the discussion so far is that we should have an English manager moving forward, and my personal wish is that we should have an English manager post-Fabio Capello and post-the Euros,\" Bevington said. He sounds just as silly as the England and Wales Cricket Board when it decided it would appoint an English coach in 2007. Duncan Fletcher, although outstanding in his technical skills, had perhaps taken the team as far as he could. The man the ECB came up with was Peter Moores. Moores got the job because he had done a decent job at the academy at Loughborough \u2013 and he got that job because he had led Sussex to their first championship title in 2003. As any Sussex supporter will tell you, the main reason the county won that title was because, in Mushtaq Ahmed, they had the outstanding wicket-taker in county cricket, plus a formidable run-scorer in Murray Goodwin. Moores, who is now in charge at Lancashire, is a thoroughly decent man, a great organiser and probably a cut above the average county coach. But he was not an international coach and because he had never played for England he would always struggle to have sufficient respect from all of England's players. Moores's great legacy was to appoint Andy Flower, who is proving to be an outstanding international operator at Test, one-day and Twenty20 level, even though he is not conspicuously English. The lesson the FA must take from the ECB is not to decide on the nationality of the coach two years in advance. The best decision, surely, is to appoint the best man available. As there are only six English managers in the Premier League it may be difficult finding an Englishman anyway. As for Capello, the FA would surely have been better advised to post him his P45 \u2013 if it could have afforded it \u2013 after the humiliating World Cup experience, where his tactics were almost as lamentable as his inability to get the best out of his admittedly limited players. Just what went wrong in South Africa has not been properly explained but despite Capello's sensational honeymoon period he is clearly not the coach we hoped he would be. Life is a little like that for everyone. Julian Barnes, in Talking It Over, once marvellously observed that life was like invading Russia. \"A blitz start, massed shakos, plumes dancing like a flustered henhouse; a period of svelte progress recorded in ebullient despatches as the enemy falls back; then the beginning of a long morale-sapping trudge with rations getting shorter and the first snowflakes on your face.\" Ultimately, says Barnes, \"you fall beneath a boy-gunner's grapeshot while crossing some Polish river not even marked on your general's map\". Well the World Cup in South Africa probably was marked on Capello's map but he made a botch of it, just as he messed up on David Beckham. Beckham, who should have gone some years ago, rather resembles one of those irritating houseguests who overstays his welcome. You know the sort. He just ... stays. He is so charming about the business of staying that it is difficult to show him the door \u2013 Stephen Leacock's advice in this matter revolves around the placement of a horse's head in the bed of the miscreant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
