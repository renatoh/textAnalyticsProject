The 32-year-old West Indian batsman, who is in the middle of his first championship match at the Riverside and will leave before the end of the season for the Twenty20 World Cup, said yesterday that his agent was already talking with the club. \"It [county cricket] is a little more relaxed than Test cricket but I take my cricket seriously. I am here to improve and not relax,\" said West Indies' man of the series against England. While Chanderpaul was contemplating a return to the north-east, two of Durham's homegrown talents, Kyle Coetzer and Ben Harmison, were in the middle of a stand of 182 which took the county comfortably past Warwickshire's 239 and towards 378 for six. Coetzer rode his luck for a maiden championship century - he was dropped on 58 and on 98 but went on to make 142 in 7\u00bd hours. Harmison made an unbeaten 84, his best in the championship. Matthew Maynard, who will take over as Glamorgan's cricket manager next month, was at Lord's yesterday to assess the size of his task. Had he fled the place screaming, head in hands, it would have been understandable. Glamorgan are likely to lose their 27th championship match in 2\u00bd seasons today. This summer has been written off. Middlesex, resuming on 320 for six, were bowled out for 361 and Glamorgan, needing 212 to avoid the follow-on, managed just half that, with Murali Kartik taking six for 21, the best by a Middlesex bowler this season. When Glamorgan batted again they were soon in another mess. Only David Hemp (36) showed resistance as they closed on 120 for six, still 135 behind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
