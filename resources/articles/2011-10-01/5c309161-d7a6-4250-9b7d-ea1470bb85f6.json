Mine are so dark they look like scary ponds that cats tend to drown in. My aim with this test was modest \u2013 not to look younger, or prettier, or even more awake, but simply to find a serum that made the area around my eyes look less awful. The idea is that serums should feel lighter than creams \u2013 less swampy, more delicate. The nice thing about Dr Brandt Collagen Eye Serum (\u00a364, spacenk.co.uk) is the cold applicator \u2013 it rolls on under your eyes with a little marble; it's the same feeling as when you put a cool glass against your cheek when you're drunk. And while I haven't quite noticed the dark circles dissipating yet, I have noticed fewer of those tiny dry lines. The ones that make me look a little more awful. And for that small pleasure, I applaud.
