And don't shirk the challenge that's overdue", "bodyText": "Poverty Faisal Islam, economics correspondent The acid test of Labour's radicalism will be its attitude to alleviating poverty. Four years of establishing economic credentials and a spot of targeted stealth redistribution provide a good platform for a serious assault on entrenched poverty. Entrenched poverty is not just morally abhorrent, it operates a terrible drag on the economy. Labour can and should build a national coalition for change and renewal of poor urban and rural communities, and it should make no apologies for doing so. Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world; it can afford it. The Government needs to take a leaf out of the handbooks of development economists. Poverty needs to be measured in a much more holistic manner, taking account of health, education and lack of empowerment, as well as incomes. A fifth of British adults are functionally illiterate and significantly more have numeracy problems. There are still 2.3 million 'economically inactive' men and just over one-sixth of households are workless. Economic policies need to help iron out such imbalances in regional, rural and neighbourhood prosperity. Individually tailored community Keynesianism, of the sort that has subsidised Scotland and Northern Ireland, is needed in many areas and should go beyond tiny tax credits. This will start to redress the balance for millions of Britons whose life opportunities were damaged by a sub-standard education in recent decades. It is the minimum the Government must do. Health Anthony Browne, health correspondent We have a dream: that by 2006, we will no longer be writing about the NHS. Not because it no longer exists - but because it is no longer a cause for national alarm and outrage. The NHS dominated the front pages throughout Blair's first term as it lurched from crisis to collapse and back to crisis. The barrage of statistics about funding and beds masked a scale of human tragedy now rarely seen outside the developing world: patients waiting two years for vital heart bypass operations, only to die before they got them; cancer operations cancelled dozens of times only for the patients to be told their cancer had become inoperable. Britain deserves what the rest of the developed world already has: an efficient health system that delivers modern treatments swiftly and compassionately. Having belatedly increased spending on health, Blair must continue that growth throughout this Parliament. The targets for increasing the number of doctors and nurses must be not just met but exceeded. Free long-term care must be given to the elderly in England, as it is in Scotland. Before the last election Blair said we had 24 hours to save the NHS; four years have made no difference. We cannot wait another four years. It will cost too many lives. The arts Vanessa Thorpe, arts correspondent It is too much to hope for an end to the spectacle of sheepish Ministers mixing with high-profile artists and performers. A more achievable task for those running Culture in a strengthened department under Tessa Jowell would be the clarification of the Government's approach to arts funding. The bonanza of big capital projects that followed the birth of the National Lottery and the millennium stirred up a fog of confusion and left arts administrators across the country flailing around in piles of application forms for rival subsidies and one-off grants - each with a different set of 'social' requirements. The word 'access' should be banned. It has become a stick to beat so-called 'elitism' by those who don't want art to be 'difficult'. Real access is achieved by giving children the tools to understand culture while they are in school. Then they can choose for themselves. The principle of free museum entrance established in Labour's first term must be followed by cheaper ticket prices in the subsidised theatre sector and longer opening hours for more libraries. Britain's creative industries make us money, but they are not solely vehicles for regeneration. Art should have the same relationship to education as sport has to health: they are good for each other, but they have a value of their own. Education Tracy McVeigh, education correspondent David Blunkett may think he has laid a solid foundation for four more years of 'education, education, education' but he has left a dangerous gremlin for his successor by spectacularly failing to tackle the key problem: teachers. Demoralised, overworked and underpaid, they have waited long enough for a reversal in the profession's fortunes. Forget shilly-shallying initiatives to tweak at the edges of a recruitment and retention crisis - the men and women at the chalk face need an immediate tonic if plans for the new term are to succeed. So no more excuses or finger-pointing at the Conservative past, no figure fiddling and no more expecting morale to improve all by itself. Labour's big promises are radical improvements in secondary school standards, 10,000 new teachers, free nursery places for all three-year-olds and unprecedented numbers in adult learning. None of this will happen without the wholehearted enthusiasm of teachers and the way to achieve that is fatter pay packets and slimmer folders of paperwork. By September, secondary education reforms must have been simplified and ready to slide into place smoothly and evenly. Crime Martin Bright, home affairs correspondent At the moment, it is in the interests of government and the police to lie about the scale of crime: being tough on law and order is perceived to win votes for politicians and better pay and conditions for beat officers. This cycle of cynicism must be broken and replaced with a compact between police and government to tell the truth about crime. We already have a blueprint - the Macpherson Report on the death of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The Race and Violent Crime Task Force, set up by the Metropolitan Police in the light of the inquiry, has demonstrated that the police can take a lead role in attacking received wisdom about crime. The public has been rightly shocked by the scale of racist hate crime and domestic violence uncovered by the task force, which has also identified the underreporting of homophobic crime. The priorities of new Home Secretary David Blunkett are entirely correct: violent crime, drugs and protecting communities. Blunkett should commit himself to opening up many of the police stations closed under Labour as well as increasing police numbers. As the British Crime Survey shows, despite the drop in the crime rate, the fear of becoming a victim is still strong. A commitment to honesty about crime rather than pandering to prejudice must be matched with reform of the police to weed out corruption and racism. Women Gaby Hinsliff, chief political correspondent It's the oldest euphemism in politics: the disgraced Minister slinking off 'to spend more time with his family'. Yet what would it say about Labour's commitment to work-life balance if Tony Blair, his place in history secure, announced in 2006 that he was retiring to enjoy baby Leo's childhood - and meant it? Labour's challenge is to help women juggle work and family by building on existing, welcome advances such as extended maternity pay and leave. The new battleground will be the right to work reduced hours after having children: the new independent commission on flexible working must not retreat from legally enforceable rights. Not all women are mothers, though. Other litmus tests include real progress on closing the pay gap; further tackling pensioner poverty, which disproportionately affects women, and raising girls' career expectations. A shake-up of property law to protect the rights of unmarried, cohabiting women is also overdue. Such causes were pushed in the first term by the unfairly criticised Ministers for Women: if as expected Blair abolishes that post, their work must go on elsewhere. The Cabinet reshuffle has admirably brought more women to sit at the Government's top table. And, by 2006, could we see a woman in one of the top posts - Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, even Chancellor? Europe Anthony Browne The issue is difficult, the country divided, but four years on the fence is quite long enough. Have the courage of your convictions, Tony, and fight for the euro. The opportunities to equivocate, prevaricate and procrastinate will be as plentiful in the next four years as in the past four. You can see his thinking: OK, we need a referendum, but wouldn't it be better to hold it after we've seen the smooth introduction of euro notes and coins in Euroland next January? Wouldn't it be better to wait a little bit longer, till the next summer, when Britons on their holidays have got used to handling euros in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy? Then we have to make the economic assessment of the five tests, have a referendum period, have a changeover period and, bang, we've run out of time before the next election. Perhaps, Blair will be tempted to think, we'd better hold off that referendum until next time round. Whether or not we join the euro is the most important issue we face - too important to let it flap in the wind. Get down off that fence, Tony. Your country needs action now. Transport Joanna Walters, transport editor The mild-mannered, stoical British traveller has had enough. Daily life has come down to a choice of praying for a late, dirty, overpriced train that may never turn up or inching along gridlocked, potholed roads in a cloud of petrol fumes. You could die waiting for a bus or riding a bike. Labour's first task must be to solve the rail meltdown and then get on with delivering on its promises. Four years of promises have seen Britain grind to a halt. There are two options: either we see huge progress this term or settle for total failure and travel misery for a generation to come. The pledge of \u00a3180 billion over the next 10 years sounds good. Now spend it! Whether Labour decides to renationalise Railtrack or leave it to the mercy of the markets is far less important than simply making sure we get the investment in a safe, fast, modern, growing railway that will help us catch up with the rest of Europe. If we don't have a safer, more efficient, integrated transport system by 2006, the Government deserves a one-way ticket back to the Opposition benches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
