He has signed a five-year contract on a salary of \u00a31.25m. On an extraordinary day for the club, who were relegated to the First Division this month and unexpectedly dismissed Joe Royle as manager on Monday, the 50-year-old made it clear his time out of the game had not diminished his famed, if occasionally misguided, sense of optimism. \"I'm not going to put a date on it but we've got to be looking to win the title,\" he said. \"Why not? Anything is achievable. Once you get a momentum going, everyone rowing in the same direction, it can take you beyond the expectations of the biggest optimist anywhere. \"This club has the potential to be one of the top five in the country and, after that, things can get very interesting. When we finished as First Division champions with Newcastle we put a notice in the programme saying: 'Watch out, Sir Alex Ferguson, we're after your title.' People laughed then but we damn near got it. Newcastle pleasantly surprised people and City can too. I'm not a fool and I have a real chance of success here.\" As an opening speech it was stirring stuff. Yet Keegan's priority, first and foremost, must be to rebuild his reputation from the battering it took during 19 punishing months in charge of the national team. \"I'm never going to talk about England again,\" he said. \"OK, at that level I found it tough. I've got my views on why I wasn't successful but they will stay with me. It's history now and I've put it down to experience. \"I'm going to have something to prove to everyone but that doesn't worry me. It drives me on. I've had something to prove since I was a kid and everyone said I was too small to play football. \"What I will say is that I've never considered turning my back on the game. I think my skills are more suited to club football, building something that people can be proud of. I've proved that at Newcastle and Fulham, and with a bit of luck I can do it here.\" This afternoon a specially convened board meeting will let him know exactly how much money is available, although it will be no more than \u00a38m next season, with a further \u00a320m should he lead City back to the Premiership at the first attempt. \"All the ingredients are there. Now we have to put them in a pan and cook them,\" he said. Keegan has asked Willie Donachie to remain at the club and named his old ally Arthur Cox as chief scout. He is also likely to recruit Derek Fazackerley, along with Peter Beardsley or Paul Bracewell. He will be the highest-paid manager in the First Division and his high-profile arrival saw the club installed as bookmakers' favourites to win the league. \"We've got a reputation for managerial changes but this is an experience I desperately want to avoid again,\" said City's chairman David Bernstein. \"Kevin's record at Newcastle and Fulham is the stuff of legends and there was only ever one target.\" Of that there is little doubt, although there was considerable embarrassment when Keegan disclosed that City had made their initial contact 24 hours before Royle's sacking. In perhaps his loosest comment since infamously blurting out on Sky that he would \"love it\" if Newcastle beat Manchester United to the title in 1996, he revealed: \"I got a phone call on Sunday to see if I was interested and then I was approached on Monday.\" Royle had been manager for just over three years - a period in which City dropped for the first time in their history to the Second Division. He then led them to successive promotions before this single season in the Premiership. In accepting what has frequently been described as a poisoned chalice Keegan becomes City's seventh manager in eight years. \"When you're a kid, your mum always tells you to steer clear of any main road,\" he joked. But at a club that has become a bastion of heroic failure, only time will tell whether he should have heeded the advice. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
