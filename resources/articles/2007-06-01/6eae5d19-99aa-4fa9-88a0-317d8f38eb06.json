The retiring referee claimed that officials in the Premiership had \"agreed not to take action\" against misbehaving managers because the Football Association would not back them. Poll, who had earlier slammed the FA and its chief executive, Brian Barwick, as being \"inherently weak\", also claimed that many clubs kept dossiers to exploit the weaknesses of some officials. But the LMA vice-chairman, Frank Clark, said: \"I am very disappointed with his comments. He seems to be putting himself forward as a mouthpiece for all referees. We've worked hard with Keith Hackett and the refereeing people to establish some lines of communication between managers and referees and we think it has been successful. \"We expect our members to show respect while they are in the technical area. But statistics show that the situation is no worse in terms of the numbers of managers that have been sent off by referees and charged by the Football Association. \"We just find his comments disappointing. If he felt that strongly about the behaviour of coaches, why didn't he bring it to the attention of the relevant authorities? We are also disappointed with his comments about Brian Barwick. Brian, as chief executive of the FA, must distance himself from the disciplinary procedures. We are not saying the situation is perfect but we continually point out the need for our members to be respectful.\" Poll attacked some of his fellow officials when he claimed: \"At the last group meeting of this season, some senior referees agreed not to take action against managers. What's the point? The FA won't do anything. We're losing that war.\" He recalled an incident towards the end of last season when Chelsea's Jose Mourinho appeared to banish himself from the technical area after showing dissent to the Tring official, who refereed his last domestic match in the Coca-Cola Championship final at Wembley. Poll, 43, insists that such actions undermine the role of the match officials. \"If a manager sends himself off because he's said far too much and I don't send him off, what does that tell you? It says the credibility has gone and for that reason my 27th and final season as a referee was not enjoyable.\" Sunderland's chairman, Niall Quinn, is optimistic that his Premiership newcomers will soon have new players. The manager, Roy Keane, has acknowledged the need to strengthen and speculation is rife on Wearside about who will be arriving this summer. Quinn said: \"We are trying to strengthen and we're working hard. There are a lot of people jostling for position at the moment and clubs are flexing their muscles. But it should all fall into place pretty soon. And Roy is the person who will break the news of who we are attempting to sign.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
