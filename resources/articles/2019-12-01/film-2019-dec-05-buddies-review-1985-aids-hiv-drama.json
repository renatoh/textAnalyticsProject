The stripped-down storyline focuses on two characters, with others appearing behind shower curtains or overheard on a phone. David, a young print industry worker (he\u2019s offended when called a \u201cword processor\u201d, which just goes to show how much terms have shifted), is gay and lives in New York with his boyfriend, Steve, and regularly checks in with his supportive parents, especially his loving mom. However, he\u2019s not politically active and wouldn\u2019t even go to Gay Day, the precursor of Pride marches, lest such behaviour might frighten the heterosexual horses around him. Spurred to do something to help as the HIV epidemic starts to mow down people in the city and beyond, he signs up to be a buddy to those with Aids, a condition that at this time was essentially a death sentence. He\u2019s assigned to Robert (Geoff Edholm), a one-time Adonis who is slowly fading away in a hospital, alone, broke and frightened, having been cast out by his parents when he came out years before, dumped by his lover and still pining for the love of his life who\u2019s back on the other coast, unable to visit. Through a series of sometimes slightly stilted but nevertheless resonant conversations about anger, identity politics and activism, David gets his consciousness raised. It\u2019s sad to learn that both the writer-director-producer Arthur J Bressan Jr and actor Edholm both died from HIV-related illness not long after this was made; and the tragedy depicted, amped up by the sawing strings on the soundtrack (the score by Jeffrey Olmstead is great), will reduce many viewers to teary puddles. But there\u2019s joy here as well, not least in the audaciously frank scene where David smuggles in an expensive VCR (\u201cYou can watch anything whenever you want!\u201d) so he and Robert can watch some gay porn together. Those were the days. \u2022 Buddies is released in the UK on 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
