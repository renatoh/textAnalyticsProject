The answer would appear to be, as Iain Gately imagines a pre-Columban South American saying: \"Because we are humans.\" This may surprise the primates in South African zoos who have taken up the habit, but let us deal just with Homo sapiens's relationship with the weed. There have been plenty of good books about it in the last decade, so we are getting familiar with the story, such as its ritualistic use among South American tribes. But tobacco was not just used for shamanic purposes. That would involve ingesting - smoking, drinking, chewing, snorting, or per anum - enough of the powerful local herb to produce hallucinations, convulsions and near-death. (Ask your local garden centre for \"fuomo loco\", the nicotine-enriched Brazilian strain, if you want to grow your own; instructions are provided at the end of the book.) There were plenty of other uses: as an appetite suppressant, a fender-off of storms, a medical diagnostic tool, a mild disinfectant, a token of peace and friendship, or an excuse to get off your feet for a moment. Smokers are pariahs now, but over the centuries taxes levied on us have built empires. It is the quintessential luxury: addictive, self-consuming, a bit of a nuisance, and not remotely necessary. Gately asks why governments have never taxed other non-essentials, such as tomatoes. Presumably this is a rhetorical question, for to ask it is to answer it: even when people have been repeatedly exposed to tomatoes, they do not feel an overwhelming desire for them. Tobacco is the fourth cushion on the divan of pleasure, as one commentator puts it; the others are coffee, wine and opium. Tomatoes do not get a look-in. The first European smokers may have been Rodrigo de Jerez and Luis de Torres, who got themselves hooked on a voyage with Columbus, but the first great smokers were the British. The French used it as medicine and cosmetic; in Italy it was administered by priests; the Germans analysed it scientifically; the Swiss tested it on a dog before declaring it fit for human consumption. The British, though, by the end of the 16th century, were smoking their heads off, as were the Dutch. Bear in mind that the tobacco smoked then was considerably more intoxicating than the flue-cured variety in cigarettes today. \"The average gallant required so many smoking accessories, including tobacco boxes, knives, tongs and pipes, that a dedicated manservant was required to carry them.\" Gately is so enthusiastic about his subject that one half expects to see an acknowledgment to Forest. The book may not be for you if you are trying to give up, for the descriptions of the habit's appeal are subtle and compelling. That is, until we get to lung cancer, a disease that did not strike smokers in significant numbers until the 1930s. The mass-produced cigarette would appear to be the culprit. Dark tobaccos, such as the French smoke, tend not to polish users off so early; pipes and cigars hardly seem to do their users any harm at all. As for the dangers of passive smoking, Gately becomes almost intemperate when chronicling attempts to ban smoking on the grounds that it harms non-smokers; understandable in view of the chopped logic and statistical misinterpretation employed by the more militant anti-tobacco campaigners. This is a thorough, fascinating and highly readable book. It covers familiar ground, but doesn't repeat what others have said. Gately does not, however, mention the huge rise in hand-rolled cigarettes in this country, caused by a combination of high tax on manufactured ones, and the perceived dangers of tobacco adulterated with anything besides marijuana. I am waiting for a call from a spokesperson for John Sinclair Ltd, who make the almost ludicrously more-ish brand, Cutters Choice, to tell me precisely how much adulteration is going on over there. You would have thought they would be anxious for the plug, so to speak, but tobacco always manages to sell itself one way or another."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
