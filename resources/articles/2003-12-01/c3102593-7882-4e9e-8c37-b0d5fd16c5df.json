The jockeys concerned, including Timmy Murphy and Marcus Foley, were all banned for a total of 19 days, and though the winner, Dream Falcon, was not involved, the second and third horses past the post were both disqualified. The farcical sight of a field splitting into three groups to pass around a dolled-off obstacle came at the second-last flight in a juvenile selling hurdle. Claire Stretton, who had fallen from Mizinky at the same hurdle on the first circuit, was still unconscious and being treated by paramedics as the field approached. Several jockeys veered on to the chase course through a gap in the rails while Foley and Murphy, riding Triumph Of Dubai and Blue Savanna respectively, remained on the hurdle course but passed the flight on the right. Only three riders chose, correctly, to pass the obstacle on the stands side. All seven horses, including Diamond Orchid and Triumph Of Dubai, who were second and third past the post, were inevitably disqualified. The others involved were Craigmor, Seraph, Sigwells Club Boy and Golden Fields. Dream Falcon and Rodi Greene were eventually confirmed as having won at 20-1, while La Rose and Margarets Wish were promoted to fill the frame. Yesterday's confusion followed a similar incident at Towcester on Monday, when the first five horses home in an event for amateur riders were disqualified for taking the wrong course. However, in that case none of the riders was suspended, as the stewards believed there were mitigating circumstances. Stretton was later taken to hospital by the racecourse ambulance. \"She has been taken to Hereford hospital, but she was conscious when she went,\" said Bill Turner, Mizinky's trainer. \"She was badly concussed but there are no broken bones and they are just keeping her in for observation.\" In addition to Foley and Murphy, the stewards banned Mark Nicolls, James Davies, Paddy Brennan, Antony Evans and Gabriel Hannon. All seven received 12 days' suspension for taking the wrong course, and a further seven for failing to pull their mounts up having done so. The suspensions will start on December 29. \"It is very disappointing and frustrating that this unfortunate incident has occurred,\" John Maxse, the Jockey Club's media director, said later. \"It is the responsibility of the riders to know what course to take. The map in the weighing room was correctly marked and clearly showed that the hurdles in the home straight should be bypassed on the left, the stands side. Three senior riders were in no doubt about what course to take.\" However, Foley said last night that he was surprised by the length of the ban, and is likely to appeal. \"Without doubt it's far too long a ban,\" he said. \"I thought that the flag men were in the wrong place. \"When me and Timmy got to the dolled-off hurdle, there was a gap left and right, and nothing to show you where to go. If we'd known we'd gone wrong we would have pulled up, but we've got an extra seven days for not pulling up. \"If you get 19 days you're basically off the course for a month. The amateurs on Monday didn't even get one day for taking the wrong course. You only get 10 days for not trying, and we're actually trying, we just took the wrong course.\" An hour later Murphy was in front of the stewards again after television cameras clearly showed him hitting his mount, Summer Bounty, with his fist in the handicap hurdle. \"The stewards got him in and cautioned him as to his future conduct,\" Owen Byrne, a Jockey Club spokesman, said last night. \"They also had the horse checked out thoroughly and found it to be unharmed. I'm pretty sure that this was his first offence of this nature.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
