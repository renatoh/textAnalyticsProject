As Paul Robinson recognised, it was once again something of a wake up call for commercial radio. Of the 30 categories that are available in open competition, the judges awarded 21 golds to the BBC and nine to commercial operators. If we analyse the programme, as opposed to the station categories, we discover that the BBC won 20 of 24. Of those 20 gold wins, the BBC had commissioned six of them from independent production companies, and overall, independent productions were responsible for almost a quarter of the 110 nominations in categories open to them. Channel 4 Radio has already made clear its intention to make full use of independents should it be successful in its bid to operate the second national commercial DAB multiplex. The newly introduced category for \"radio\" distributed via the internet delivered three of the five nominations to independent productions. One can't help but wonder whether the commercial sector isn't missing a trick by not making more use of this section of the UK's creative community. As Robinson observed, if the awards are to be more than a good night out for the entrants, then perhaps they need to invest even more in the programming talent at their disposal.

Mental Health Media exists to try to generate better coverage of mental health, and so a greater understanding of the issues among the public. Last year I took part in the awards and was genuinely impressed by some of the media output that won. This year I am supporting their efforts to attract even more entries. The Mental Health Media Awards 2007 are now looking for nominations from your readers of good, accurate coverage of mental health issues in the media over the last year. The awards also cover radio and TV drama and documentaries - EastEnders won an award last year for its excellent storyline about bi-polar disorder. Nominations close on May 31. For more information, or to nominate something you've seen, heard or read, go to www.mhmawards.net. Alastair Campbell, Mental Health Media Awards 2007 BBC foreign affairs blow Readers might like to note yet another nail in the coffin of the BBC's coverage of foreign affairs and, in particular of radio broadcasting in English: A World In Your Ear - the weekly Radio 4 programme, which for nearly 10 years has showcased the best English language radio from around the world and looked at how it covers world events, has been axed \"for financial reasons\". This follows the axing of Radio 5 Live's Euronews and the slashing of budgets for daily programmes with a high foreign affairs content, like R4's The World Tonight. A World In Your Ear has been produced by the team of BBC World Current Affairs (the same team that produces Crossing Continents and From Our Own Correspondent). This weekly programme is popular round the globe and among radio industry specialists too. It is another sad blow to foreign affairs broadcasting. The last programmes run on Saturdays at 5.30pm until May 26; don't miss them: it's the end of an era.
