It therefore gave me a considerable degree of satisfaction to win last week's European Union Chess Championship in Liverpool, the city where I began my very long tournament road more than 33 years ago. Were it not for the precipitous physical collapse that so often accompanies the end of a strenuous event and which has momentarily rendered me an invalid, I would be ecstatic. Two young Englishmen, Gawain Jones and Stephen Gordon, obtained coveted grandmaster norms, while another, Simon Williams, despite a shocking last-round defeat to the pugnacious Danny Gormally, impressed with his overt dynamism bordering on ferocity. This suggests that chess in this country would thrive, if only players were given sufficient opportunities. It is a fairly obvious point, but one likely to be lost on the current near-moribund national administration. One hopes that enterprising local initiatives, like the one in Liverpool, will help fill in some of the organisational void. I started excellently, but became becalmed in the middle of the tournament, when I allowed a large chasing group to catch me up. However, with the finishing line in sight, I poured what remained of my energy into the last game, striking against the wily old veteran and my former nemesis, Mark Hebden. Having led throughout, my tie-break was unbeatable. However, as it turned out, no one else could match my score and I won outright, to the delight of the sponsors, who never enjoy messy finishes. Short, N (2676) - Hebden, M (2532) [C58], EU Championship, Liverpool, England (10), 15/09/2006 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 [Mark's opening repertoire has been etched in stone now for many a decade. While the two knights defence has a good theoretical reputation, it is not without risks, as it involves a gambit] 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Na5 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 8.Qf3 [This slightly unusual move has an interesting history: it was first played (unsuccessfully) by Wayte in England in 1835 (!). Alekhine tried it in 1906 and later Bogoljubov popularised it to some degree] h6 9.Ne4 Nd5 10.Ba4 [This is rare.] Be7 11.d3 0-0 12.0-0 f5 13.Ng3 Be6 14.Re1 Bd6 15.c4 Ne7 16.Bd2 c5 17.Nc3 a6 [It is clear that Black has failed to generate sufficient counterplay for his pawn] 18.Nd5 [Fritz recommends the incisive and highly tactical 18.Nh5! eyeing both g7 and f4. Perhaps it wins. What is clear is that I squandered much of my initiative over the coming moves] Nac6 19.Bxc6 Nxc6 20.Bc3 Qe8 21.h3 Rd8 22.Re2 Bb8 23.Rae1 a5 24.a3 Nd4 25.Bxd4 cxd4 26.Nb6 e4! 27.dxe4 f4 28.Nf1 Qc6 29.Nd5 Qxc4 30.Nd2 Qb5 31.Qb3 Qxb3 32.Nxb3 Bxd5 33.exd5 Rxd5 [Black has regained the lost pawn, but is by no means out of the woods yet. Hebden apparently offered a draw here, which I did not hear] 34.Rd2 Be5 35.Nc1 a4? DIAGRAM [Blitzed out, but this is an extremely impetuous and bad move, offering a juicy target] 36.Nd3 Bd6 37.Rc2! f3 [Again played at high speed] 38.g3 h5 39.Rc4 h4 40.g4 [With the time control reached, Black's position is in tatters] Ra5 41.Rxd4 Rf6 42.Ree4 Bc7 43.Kf1 Rc6 44.Rxa4 Rxa4 45.Rxa4 Rd6 46.Ne1 Rd1 47.Re4 Rb1 [Looks tricky, but the activity is soon quashed] 48.Re8+! Kh7 [If 48..Kf7 49.Re3!] 49.Rf8 Bd6 50.Rxf3 Rxb2 51.Rc3 Be5 52.Rd3 Bb8 53.Nf3 Ba7 54.Rd2 Rb3 55.Kg2 Rxa3 56.Nxh4 [The resultant endgame is quite lost, but Hebden contrives to succumb with alacrity] Bb8 57.Nf3 Bf4 58.Rd4 g5 59.h4! [Undermining the prop on which the bishop leans] 1-0"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
