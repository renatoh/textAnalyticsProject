The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a road warning for drivers in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs to exercise extreme care as gusty winds, slippery roads and rain will make driving conditions dangerous. A huge swell forced the the cancellation of some Sydney ferry services between Manly and Circular Quay on Tuesday. Jetstar cancelled a flight from Melbourne to Sydney on Tuesday afternoon while one Qantas and two Virgin flights going in the other direct were also grounded. A flight from Wellington to Sydney was facing a delayed arrival. Airlines have warned passengers to check for up dates. Train commuters have also been told to allow extra travel time with delays to some services due to the wet weather conditions. An estimated 800 households on the NSW Central Coast \u2013 Canton Beach, Noraville and Toukley \u2013 lost power and emergency crews have been working to restore electricity. Sarah Scully, a Bureau of Meteorology forecaster, said a cold front that has headed north from Victoria has developed into a deep low pressure system off the coast of NSW and brought gale to storm force southerly winds. \u201cThe worst of the winds have moved through Sydney now and overnight are expected to ease below the warning criteria,\u201d she told the Guardian. However, dangerous surf conditions will continue until about Thursday. Victoria\u2019s weather is expected to be settled until the weekend, because the state experienced the worst of it on Sunday and Monday, Scully said. The NSW State Emergency Service has received almost 460 calls for help since Monday from as far south as Eden up to the mid north coast. In Sydney, there have been 230 requests for assistance, with Sutherland, Warringah and Blacktown the worst affected areas. \u201cThe majority of those jobs have been related to wind damage, we\u2019ve had trees down on rooves and vehicles and roof damage from intense rain \u2013 issues with gutters,\u201d an SES spokeswoman told the Guardian. The SES is urging people to move their cars away from trees, secure loose outdoor items and steer clear of fallen power lines. The Blue Mountains west of Sydney woke to a blanket of snow, while the bureau said there had also been falls in Queensland\u2019s Granite Belt region, west of Brisbane, but flakes were few and far between and it was not expected to settle. Snow was also reported across the border in northern NSW. \u201cIt was sleeting for maybe 10 minutes, then some flurries of pure snow flakes started coming down,\u201d Ken Kato told the ABC from Eukey. About five centimetres of snow settled on Katoomba, Blackheath and surrounding areas on Tuesday morning, as a burst of cold weather hits the state. The ice and snow temporarily forced the closure of the Great Western Highway at Katoomba, Mount Victoria and Blackheath, as well as a section of the Bells Line of Road. Snow also affected several local roads in the Central Tablelands and Snowy Mountains, with falls recorded in Oberon, Lithgow, and Armidale in the state\u2019s north. The arrival of a cold air mass about midnight caused temperatures to fall, and icy winds made it seem much colder. At Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, the temperature felt like -4.6C early on Tuesday morning, even though the official temperature was 3.1C. It was a similar situation in other southern inland communities, where the \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature was at or slightly below zero. Sydneysiders are being warned to take care as damaging and destructive winds lash the coast. The intense Tasman low and associated cold front is producing winds averaging 60 to 70km/h, with gusts of more than 90km/h. Ulladulla, on the south coast, recorded a wind gust of 130km/h just before 4am on Tuesday - the highest in its nine years of data. Sydney Airport recorded a gust of 91km/h at 10am, while on the harbour it peaked at 85km/h. NSW assistant police commissioner Michael Corboy said roads will be slippery and visibility poor, and stressed the need to go slow and follow directions. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your life at risk \u2013 it\u2019s the lives of the emergency service workers some of whom are volunteers,\u201d he said in a statement. with agencies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
