Once arch purveyors of lispy indiedom, they became the luckiest dance chancers of all, graduating (in the manner of all bands who run out of ideas) to impersonating the Rolling Stones circa Exile on Main St, before their current incarnation as a more casually attired Sigue Sigue Sputnik. A slow new song suggests they'll soon be trekking their weary way down the Massive Attack route. For all their dilettante dabblings and Stars in Their Eyes shallowness, they have continuity: each phase has been underpinned by Stooges and MC5 inflections. Moreover, they have never failed to convince or excite. The Astoria is uncomfortably full. Enervated as ever, Bobby Gillespie is as contradictory as his band. Mumbling between songs, virtually immobile save for the occasional flirtation with tambourine or maracas, he still (almost uniquely for a frontman) responds to individual crowd salutes. Once the music begins, he transforms himself into a roaring vocal lion, but the real meat is delivered around him. The duel between Martin Duffy's Rick Wakeman-style banks of keyboards and four guitarists, including My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields and former Stone Rose Gary \"Mani\" Mounfield, is an affirmation of the capacity of full-pelt rock to thrill. Gillespie's task in Shoot Speed/Kill Light is merely to stand there and shout the title, a role he embraces with gusto, but the wonderfully strobe-lit piece is a complex display of bravura instrumentation. Both Rocks and Accelerator are ideal for live performance, while Swastika Eyes is undone by its silly, attention-seeking title. They close with a perfunctory amble through MC5's Kick Out the Jams and refuse to do a second encore, much to the crowd's chagrin: it was as if they knew those musical crossroads had been reached.
