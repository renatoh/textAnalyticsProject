Since the first \"Baker days\" were introduced by the then education secretary, Kenneth Baker, in 1985, a minimum of five training days have been set aside for teachers in mainstream schools. These are run for a variety of reasons and provide the opportunity for teachers to discuss how to implement the national, regional and local policies that have been produced at the loss of several forests during the past 25 years. Given the emphasis in current thinking on learning and teaching, it would seem appropriate that teachers are provided with the opportunity to recharge their thinking by reflecting on the government's plans to remodel the school workforce. It has taken several summers and lots of paper to generate a plan that is to unburden teachers, who have been beset by additional administrative tasks since the 1988 Education Reform Act and the start of the national curriculum. Additional staff are being employed to stand by the photocopier, collect dinner money, take the register, provide cover for absentee teachers and provide additional support in the classroom. Whilst headteachers and their staff are now in the enviable position of having additional help, they are also faced with the problem of how to fully utilise the remodelled workforce. As headteachers tackle this issue, many of the recent training days will have focused on creating and implementing policies on how best to manage the workforce. Once the workforce development plan has started, the next step is to ensure that there is appropriate follow-up. An action plan is the link between training and follow-up. It is the implementation process that links new learning to practice in the school and classroom. A good action plan needs to give detailed consideration not only to the intended innovation, but also to the strategy that will be employed to implement it. The process of planning is often more important than the plan. In terms of the innovation itself, the action plan might address a range of questions, including who will benefit from a remodelled workforce: pupils/ students, colleagues? What will the costs be for those affected? Will additional resources be required to monitor the additional resources? Once the workforce remodelling agenda has been agreed at the local level, it is also worth considering: is the change easy to communicate to those concerned and will they see its purpose? If this is not agreed, will it be possible to adapt what is intended to suit specific circumstances? Whose support will be needed? Will key people have a sense of ownership of the change? Given the opportunities that exist with the remodelled workforce, it is time for all involved to train their own staff. This is where 20 years of Baker days, over one-third of a year of training, has led. If teachers do not work this one out for themselves, those hard-working civil servants will do it for them. \u00b7 Professor Sonia Blandford is dean of education at Canterbury Christ Church University College. masterclass@cant.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
