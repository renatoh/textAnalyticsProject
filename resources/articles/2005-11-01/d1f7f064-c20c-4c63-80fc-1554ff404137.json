Even so, Richard Lapthorne of Cable &amp; Wireless laid it on with a trowel yesterday: if we're snapped up by a private equity firm, the City will have itself to blame, he argued. There was, naturally, a more sophisticated strategic pitch alongside this howl for attention. Chief executive Francesco Caio explained how the acquisition of Energis and creation of C&amp;W's next generation internet-based network will allow it to manage the transition of corporate customers from old fashioned telephony services to new internet services. Meanwhile its Bulldog broadband business will help to provide direct connectivity to consumers and businesses, by-passing BT, thus reducing C&amp;W's costs. In three to four years, it was said, new C&amp;W UK will generate double-digit operating profit margins and sales above \u00a32bn. In revenue terms that's not too different from today, but in profit terms it's a revolution. So why the City scepticism? Well, investors - especially C&amp;W's - know that events can get in the way. In this case, the list of potential pitfalls is long. There's the fact that C&amp;W will be supporting two cost bases and integrating Energis while managing the migration of its existing customers; it must also urgently find a remedy for the customer service headaches at loss-making Bulldog broadband; and it has to be wary of better funded rivals such as Sky, BT and AOL trampling on its front lawn. Volatility in earnings is inevitable, to which Lapthorne replies that C&amp;W must not jeopardise its long-term ambition by being \"hemmed in\" by short-term financial targets. \"Life does not always drop into convenient accounting periods.\" That's true, of course, but nor does life always offer easy solutions to difficult problems. Frankly, C&amp;W's current appeal to private equity looks limited: that breed of buyer tends to prefer cash-generative companies with clear and defendable positions in their market. Lapthorne has a lot more work to do before C&amp;W can claim to be in that camp. Party pooper Sir Callum McCarthy, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, is certainly talking tough. The no-nonsense Scot admitted yesterday that the City regulator was investigating \"at least\" one hedge fund about market conduct. No names, no pack-drill, but McCarthy did admit that one area of concern is the way privileged information gleaned legitimately in debt instruments is used in equity markets. It sounds remarkably similar to a much reported investigation into London hedge fund GLG. The regulator is also worried about whether the \"high rewards\" on offer to hedge fund traders are encouraging bad market conduct. In plain speech, is the lure of big bonuses enticing traders to push back boundaries? The FSA, he promised the Treasury select committee of MPs, is \"revving up\" and investing heavily in its market abuse systems. He also threatened any firms wrapped in the chaos of credit derivatives - which have grown so fast that the firms trading them cannot process the deals quickly enough - with a \"pincer movement\" alongside the New York Federal Reserve. The concern is that the back offices, where trades are processed, can't keep up; that, presumably, could be a problem if the FSA ever needs to launch an inquiry into a big financial accident. While it could be argued that the FSA is a little late to the hedge fund party, it is starting to feel as if a crack-down is on the cards. The collision of an \u00fcber-regulator, armed with unprecedented powers of investigation, and an industry where secrecy has become a bad habit could be spectacular. He loves me (not) George Davies is showing distinctly Vicki Pollard-like tendencies: \"yeah, but no, but yeah, but ... and then he said he loved me, and I said he couldn't possibly if he was so keen on that Kate Bostock and he said he wanted us both and couldn't choose and I said he was a two-timing cheat and that his friends had said bad things about me and I said...\" It's all so tiring. Four weeks ago M&amp;S was accusing George of demanding \u00a3150m and having a tantrum when Stuart Rose was not forthcoming. Now, after just one beer with Rose, George has evidently dropped all such silly demands and is desperate to be back working for the store he loves on the Per Una label he has nurtured. It is all a bit hard to swallow, especially as no contracts have been signed and no remuneration agreed for Mr Davies to move up to become chairman of Per Una next year. Yesterday Mr Rose said three weeks was a long time in retailing. Seven months, therefore, gives infinite scope for a lot more yeah, but no, but yeah-ing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
