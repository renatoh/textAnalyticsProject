In a speech to the United Nations general assembly, the prime minister, whose authority at home has been severely tested since June\u2019s general election result, sought to project her vision of a \u201crules-based\u201d international order. She said global cooperation was the only way to confront shared international challenges, including terrorism, climate change, and mass movements of refugees \u2013 and condemned countries that fail to play by the rules. The prime minister did not name the US president directly but made clear that she believed ongoing membership of the Paris climate change accord was as important as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in maintaining global security. \u201cAs the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by states deliberately flouting \u2013 for their own gain \u2013 the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security,\u201d she said. She singled out Russia, Syria and North Korea for direct condemnation, but described the climate change treaty as part of the \u201crules-based system\u201d that protects global peace and security. \u201cIt is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause between nations to act together in our shared interest and form the multilateral system. \u201cAnd it is this rules-based system which we have developed \u2013 including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris climate change accord, and laws and conventions like the non-proliferation treaty \u2013 which enables the global co-operation through which we can protect those values.\u201d She warned that undermining these international institutions, including the UN, ultimately threatened states\u2019 national interests. \u201cIf this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples.\u201d The prime minister was the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House, brushing off concerns in some European capitals about his unpredictability. But she has repeatedly expressed concern about his decision to seek to renegotiate the Paris treaty, and a planned state visit to the UK has been indefinitely postponed, amid fears of public protests. She delivered the speech just an hour before she was due to meet Trump for a bilateral meeting in a New York hotel. In his own speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the US president described the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as \u201crocket man\u201d, and threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Kim\u2019s country if it did not rein in its nuclear ambitions. May issued her own strongly worded condemnation of North Korea\u2019s actions, but stopped short of threatening military action. \u201cTime after time he has shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding states,\u201d she said of Kim Jong-un. \u201cContempt for his neighbours. And contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security. \u201cOn this challenge the UN has in recent weeks shown it can step up to the task, with last Monday\u2019s security council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the 21st century. We have seen regional and global powers coming together and \u2013 as in its founding charter \u2013 putting aside limited self-interest to show leadership on behalf of the wider world.\u201d She also criticised Russia for using its veto on the UN security council to block tougher action against Syria for using chemical weapons on civilians. \u201cOne country in particular has used its veto as many times in the last five years as in the whole of the second half of the cold war. And in so doing they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons,\u201d she said. May was applauded when she recounted the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester earlier this year, and said: \u201cThe terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s trip to New York has been overshadowed by speculation about Boris Johnson\u2019s future, after the foreign secretary wrote a 4,000-word article for the Daily Telegraph that appeared to set out a distinctive vision for Brexit. But on Wednesday night her spokesman said Johnson had changed plans and would fly back to London alongside May on the prime minister\u2019s RAF Voyager jet to attend a specially convened meeting of the cabinet, where she hopes her colleagues will back her on Brexit. Her UN address, delivered as she prepares for a major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday, was aimed at presenting Britain as a free-trading, outward-looking country that would continue to play its role in the world. May also urged the UN to reform, and repeated a pledge by her international development secretary, Priti Patel, that Britain would withhold up to 30% of its \u00a390m a year core funding to the UN, unless it could meet performance targets showing that it was delivering value for money. \u201cThroughout its history the UN has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery,\u201d May said. \u201cWhen the need for multilateral action has never been greater, the shortcomings of the UN and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of states as members and donors. \u201cEven more importantly, they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely upon the blue helmets; who rely upon that sign I stand in front of today coming to their aid in the darkest of hours.\u201d After delivering her speech, May went straight to the bilateral meeting with Trump, at the Lotte New York Palace hotel. Seated in front of US and UK flags, Trump said: \u201cWe will be doing a lot of trading with the UK and we look forward to it.\u201d May said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had many discussions between our representatives and ourselves on a whole variety of issues \u2013 including trade, which is important for us, and some other policy issues \u2013 and our security and defence relationship, which of course is the closest we have.\u201d The prime minister used the meeting as an opportunity to lobby Trump over the importance of preserving jobs at aerospace giant Bombardier in Northern Ireland, and to press the president over the importance of the international nuclear deal with Iran, which he has threatened to tear up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
