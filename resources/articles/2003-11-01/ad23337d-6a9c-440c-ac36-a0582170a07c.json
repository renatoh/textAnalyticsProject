The initiative, known as the Enterprise Advisor Service, has been allotted \u00a316m and required the recruitment of over 100 enterprise advisors. The idea is to improve the employment prospects of young people by organising work-based experience. Commenting on the initiative, the general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, John Dunford, called it: \"the straw that breaks the camel's back.\" Mr Dunford believes that government funding should go directly into the schools, rather than spending it on business advisors. \"There are so many priorities at the present time that it will be difficult to put this into action. There are thousands of better things that schools should spend the money on\" Mr Dunford said. The assistant general secretary of the SHA, Bob Carstairs, added that inner-city schools were desperate that money be channelled into areas such as building repairs and teachers' salaries. However, the LSC chief executive Mark Haysom called the service \"a tremendous initiative, which will give young people a real taste of work and the world of business.\" Mr Haysom said that encouraging close relationships between schools and local employers was vitally important in tackling the skills shortages faced in Britain. \"Working together we can ensure that young people leave school with the right skills for future employment, \" he added. In his budget statement earlier this year, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, singled out 'enterprise in the curriculum' as a priority. \"And the LSC is responding positively to that,\" Mr Hayson continued. \"Enterprise advisors will provide a pool of expertise for head teachers to draw on in their engagement with this economically vital area, and by doing so should have a positive, rather than a negative effect on their workload\", promised the LSC. One thousand secondary schools around the country are expected to benefit from the service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
