The visit involves not only the president of a Gulf state which is crushing a pro-democracy movement, flouting international standards governing fair trials and breaching conventions on torture and human rights, but also the moral evasions of Britain's prime minister about such issues when there is a large arms deal in the offing. The red carpet is being rolled out for Sheikh Khalifa, president of the United Arab Emirates. In his honour, a state lunch is being hosted at Windsor Castle, tea is being served at Clarence House, a wreath is being laid at Westminster Abbey and a meeting will take place at Downing Street. In the shadow of all this lies a closely fought deal for at least 60 BAE Systems-backed Eurofighter Typhoon jets, which is still not in the bag after five years. France's Dassault Rafale jets are the main competitor and both David Cameron and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have been in the Gulf state to promote rival bids. A parallel $10bn arms deal between the US and Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE is also under way in the name of shoring up the Gulf states' defences against Iran. Sheikh Khalifa's visit will be a \"significant personal moment\" in his warm relationship with the Queen, Britain's ambassador to the UAE has said. To the dishonour of all involved, a show trial of which Stalin would be proud is taking place in Abu Dhabi. In all, 94 people are accused of plotting to overthrow the state. No evidence that would stand up in a court elsewhere has yet been presented. Accounts of the conduct against the detainees amount to systematic torture, according to a trial observation report issued by the Emirates Centre for Human Rights. Basic trial rights, such as the right to prepare a defence, are being flouted. A panel of UK legal observers has been denied access to the courthouse. Publicity is discouraged. Abdullah al-Hadidi was sentenced to 10 months in prison after tweeting from the court where his father is being tried. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Reprieve have all written to David Cameron about it. The trial has less to do with state allegations that a conservative religious group, al-Islah, is plotting to replace the ruling families with a hardline Islamist regime, and more to do with a petition in May 2011 demanding basic democratic rights. Rough Emirati justice is applied to all, whether Islamist or not. Three Britons held without trial for seven months on drugs charges have allegedly been tortured by police with beatings and electric shocks. The tangle between arms sales, strategic interests and the protection of human rights is age-old. This visit does nothing to resolve it. Mr Cameron cannot be permitted to sacrifice human rights on the altar of the arms trade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
