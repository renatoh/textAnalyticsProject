In their brief spots, both Joanna MacGregor and Guy Barker looked and played like winners. The commercial music industry is clearly in trouble; the talent and dignity of the non-rock artists may have reminded a few people that there's a big world outside the playground of pop, where people have careers that are about much more than deals and \"product\". The new collaboration between saxophonist/bandleader Tim Whitehead and contemporary composer Colin Riley feels like a labour of love rather than a product. The music on Tides (Homemade) is performed by the 13-strong Homemade Orchestra, whose members seem as comfortable with long, through-composed scores as they are with improvisation. You can hear the influence of each leader on the other's compositions, and Bird, the most successful of the seven tracks, is by both men. Whitehead describes the collaboration as a human experiment, while Riley claims that he is still mystified by the way jazz musicians improvise. Yet there is nothing outlandish here: the music is intelligent, confident and accessible, modestly produced. It is a form of writing and playing that you might expect to be embedded in the mainstream of contemporary music. Yet despite well documented antecedents by Stan Getz and Eddie Sauter (Focus), Neil Ardley (Greek Variations), Django Bates, Ensemble Modern and the Maarten Altena Ensemble, the classical and jazz college-leavers still seem to go their separate ways, meeting for exotic one-nighters rather than developing meaningful relationships. Riley cites Matthew Barley's Between the Notes, the Clod Ensemble, iO and the Gogmagogs as \"new breed\" ensembles permitting more creative relationships to develop between players and composers. His ensemble writing has a dark timbre that tests the sunnier moods of the all-acoustic rhythm section. Rob Millett's percussion bridges the idioms with great flair and Whitehead blows well. Tides is not a \"great album\", in Mercury terms, but it is a good start. Jazz trumpeter Nils Petter Molvaer reinvented himself with Khmer and Solid Ether, a pair of ECM albums that spawned a multitude of remixes by fashionable and/or unpronounceable names. The triple-vinyl Recoloured explored and eviscerated every nuance of Molvaer's fragile phrases and jittery, sample-heavy fusion. NP3 (Emarcy) takes him a little further down the clubby road. Molvaer's tone is non-brassy, somewhere between that of Jon Hassell and Miles Davis, and he croons the tunes moodily. Sometimes you feel you're hearing the raw, first-take version. The album starts with Tabula Rasa, with the leader's \"trumpet treatments\" over Eivind Aarset's \"guitar carpets\". Though these read more like cleaning services than music credits, the result is musical and short, leading nicely into the meaty blast of Axis of Ignorance, where American evangelists' voices are embedded in a stonking rhythm track: no less than five people are credited with drums and beats. Hurry Slowly and Marrow are more chilled, the latter dubbily reminiscent of earlier Molvaer tunes such as Vilderness and Song of Sand. Aarset, featured in the forthcoming Fertiliser festival of Norwegian music in London (October 10-13, www.plus47.com/ fertiliser) is a huge asset, adding trembling, ring modulating and even \"female Arabic\" guitars. I suspect that the more melodic tracks - Little Indian, Marrow - will turn up on compilations for years to come. Yet NP3 is not a prize-winning album, losing focus over eight, self-produced tracks, and losing it all together with the closing Nebulizer, even though parts of that track's endless eight minutes contain a taste of Molvaer at his most intense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
