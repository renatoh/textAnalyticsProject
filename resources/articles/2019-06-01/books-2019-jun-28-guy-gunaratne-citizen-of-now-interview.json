I\u2019ve always thought of that as a superpower\u2019", "bodyText": "When Guy Gunaratne was a teenager he would catch the bus home from school in north-west London, listening out for the chat of his fellow passengers. \u201cLike this one kid who said to his friend, \u2018Come on, you\u2019re moving like molasses.\u2019 That rattled in my head for so long. It\u2019s so inside,\u201d he says. \u201cLondon can be an unkind place to live and grow up in, but I just love the way we spoke, and to make something out of where you\u2019re from, loving the kind of things people usually forget or dismiss, is a thrilling experience.\u201d Gunaratne\u2019s debut novel, In Our Mad and Furious City, was longlisted for last year\u2019s Man Booker prize and shortlisted for a string of others before winning the Jhalak prize and the International Dylan Thomas award for writers under 40 last month. The Dylan Thomas jury described it as astounding, provocative and enticing, but not an easy read. \u201cPeople bring their own baggage to my baggage and that\u2019s good,\u201d responds the author, who packed his novel with things people would prefer to dismiss or forget, not least the murder of off-duty soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in broad daylight in a south London street in 2013. A lightly fictionalised version of the murder opens the novel, and is all the more shocking for the reaction it provokes on the street. \u201cThe black younger had stopped soldier-boy and struck him down with a cleaver,\u201d we are told. \u201cHe called himself the hand of Allah but to us he looked as if he had just rolled out the same school gates as us. He had the same trainers we wore. Spoke the same road slang we used. The blood was not what shocked us. For us it was his face like a mirror, reflecting our own confused and frightened thoughts.\u201d Most of the novel is written in a pungent first-person patois, which the author calls \u201croad dialect\u201d (while conceding that it\u2019s officially known as Multicultural London English or MLE). But this opening rings out like an omniscient chorus. So how closely does it reflect his own feelings? Gunaratne was in Finland when the news of the murder broke but watched the endlessly repeated film footage. \u201cThe thing that shocked me was one of the killers: the way he expressed himself really did remind me of the kind of people I grew up with. There was a perverse identification which disturbed me to the extent that I knew it was something I needed to navigate for myself.\u201d There\u2019s a ferocious energy in the language of the novel that is reminiscent of James Kelman\u2019s How Late It Was, How Late or even Anthony Burgess\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, and seems always on the point of combusting. It pushes at convention: Gunaratne\u2019s \u201cennet?\u201d, for instance, stands in for the ubiquitous \u201cinnit?\u201d. But its heightened particularity, what Gunaratne calls \u201cinsideness\u201d, seems a million miles from the softly spoken 35-year-old man sitting opposite me, who talks delicately and carefully, unafraid to let silences bloom as he picks his way through his thoughts. He wouldn\u2019t talk like this to his old schoolfriends, he points out. \u201cBut publishing is pretty middle class and I\u2019ve had to accommodate. In London, you learn to code-switch quite well and I\u2019ve always thought of that as a superpower in a way. You\u2019re able to express yourself with different vocabulary in different situations, not through any pretence but because the way you express yourself matters, and your social condition is inherited through your inheritance of dialect.\u201d Gunaratne was born in 1984 into a Sri Lankan family in Neasden, north-west London, where the novel is set. His father had arrived at 16, speaking little English, and worked his way up to a clerical job at the Sri Lankan high commission. His mother started on a supermarket check-out desk before moving to the cash office at Ikea. \u201cI\u2019ve always been quite conflicted about Neasden,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place you pass through on the way to the Hindu temple and Ikea and it\u2019s cleaved in half by a motorway. Anyone who landed there would only stay for a short while but for some reason my parents stayed on.\u201d His father would reminisce about long-gone pubs where, in the 1950s and 60s, lines of Irish itinerant workers would wait to be picked up in vans. They are memorialised in the novel in Belfast-born Caroline \u2013 one of two older narrators \u2013 though in the words of one of his central triumvirate of troubled \u201cyoungers\u201d, \u201ceverything just switched hands, like bish-bash-bosh to the next lot. Polish settled this time. Might be Somalis next, or Albanians. Hard-nut lot, ennet. Fucking Turks maybe.\u201d Education was important to his parents, though they couldn\u2019t afford fees, and he was sent to a tough local school while his \u201csuper-smart\u201d older brother won a bursary to a more desirable one outside the area. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy it, but no matter how rough that school was I felt I had to make something out of it: you have to make art from the place that you\u2019re from even if it\u2019s not as nourishing as other places,\u201d he says. In the absence of inspiration from his environment he sought it from books, hanging out in Willesden library, scouting for bargains in charity shops, and falling in love with a generation of American Jewish writers \u2013 novelists such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and Saul Bellow \u201cwho talked about not mingling\u201d. Being Jewish and from Chicago, Gunaratne discovered, had something in common with being from a Buddhist family in Neasden. Though writing was \u201ca kind of background noise\u201d throughout his childhood \u2013 \u201csomething I was always compulsively doing\u201d \u2013 his family \u201cquite sensibly\u201d didn\u2019t encourage it. He had no role models, so he did what teenagers have always done: rebelled. And his rebellion just happened to coincide with the rise of grime music. \u201cThere was something about grime that was indifferent to pleasing \u2013 it said: \u2018This is just for us\u2019,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was the music we listened to and some of my friends emceed. I didn\u2019t, but Channel U [a short-lived grime and rap satellite TV outlet] was very important to me: it screened music videos that looked like the kind of places I was from.\u201d Part of his rebellion was against the placidity of his parents\u2019 generation, their compliance with being defined by the prejudices of others, which is recalled by the elderly West Indian Nelson in the novel as \u201ca sorta deep-down shame \u2026 when I realise that this Britain here did not love me back, no matter how I feel for it\u201d. If grime offered one form of kickback for Gunaratne, another came from post-colonial literature (one of the boys is called Selvon after Sam Selvon, whose 1956 novel The Lonely Londoners pioneered the use of \u201ccreolised\u201d English). In particular, he clicked with Derek Walcott\u2019s demand that mango and breadfruit trees should be accorded the same iconical status in English poetry as the elm and the oak. \u201cI realised I could write about a chicken shop as if it was a church, or of playing football on a concrete playground as football reporters write about Barcelona,\u201d he says. The random jobs he landed after leaving school convinced him he wasn\u2019t very good at \u201canything that was likely to bring in an income\u201d, so he signed up for a film and television degree at London\u2019s Brunel University, where he made some short films, then went on to City University to study current affairs journalism. \u201cI had this maniac idea of war reportage,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d always hear stuff about the civil war in Sri Lanka. My parents would go back there, and we lived there for a year when I was about 10.\u201d He fell in love with a fellow student, Heidi Lindvall, and together they set up a film production company. They went to Sri Lanka a week after the civil war had ended to write a story about suppression of the media. It did well and gave them a calling card for television, so Gunaratne spent most of his 20s travelling around world trouble spots, \u201cinterviewing people who were vulnerable, and just listening and not flinching\u201d. Did it feel dangerous? There were times \u2013 such as negotiating unmapped landmines in Sri Lanka \u2013 when it got \u201ca bit interesting\u201d, he says. Though the couple were based in London, they followed their work around and were living in Berlin by the time Gunaratne finished the manuscript he had been writing every morning for a couple of years. Once he found an agent, things moved very quickly. There was a bidding war, \u201cso we were in the wonderful position of being able to choose\u201d. But he\u2019s taking his sudden success in his stride, saying: \u201cI do almost miss that feeling of naivety, but I\u2019m very aware that someone growing up in Neasden doesn\u2019t usually get to do this.\u201d He now flits between London and Lindvall\u2019s native Sweden where he is working on a second voice-driven novel, though this time with a single voice. Having recently become a father, he says that \u201cany time at my desk feels like a gift. And the good thing is I live in Malm\u00f6: it\u2019s healthy to have that bit of geography between the first book and the second.\u201d But he is also acutely aware of how fragile his privileges are. The chicken shop in In Our Mad and Furious City is called Ray\u2019s Chicken Paradise and is staffed by an Indian assistant known as \u201cfreshie Dave\u201d, as in \u201cFresh off the boat\u201d. \u201cHis sort were the frontline now,\u201d says Pakistan-born Yusuf, the son of an imam in a radicalising mosque. \u201cThese words like \u2018Paki\u2019, which we did our best to pacify at school, had come back sharper and took chunks out of faces like my own and Freshie Dave\u2019s.\u201d In Our Mad and Furious City is an inexorable 48-hour sprint towards riot and tragedy, its depiction of social alienation eerily prefiguring the debate about Shamima Begum, the east London schoolgirl who found herself stranded after running away to Syria. Gunaratne responded to the Begum story with a heartfelt plea to \u201cassert our belonging as being grounded in law. Anything less and we abdicate our collective responsibilities as members of civil society.\u201d Like it or not, he wrote on his website, Shamima Begum is as British as the rest of us. \u201cIt was here, in Britain, that she was radicalised. And it is here that she should face justice. The only way we can begin to understand the pathologies behind those who choose to follow ideologies of hate groups is to bring them home.\u201d The case has provoked concern, on behalf of his parents in London and his baby daughter in Sweden, as well as for himself. \u201cI feel quite deeply alarmed,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people revel in unbelonging because if you\u2019re not wholly one thing or another you become a citizen of now, and as a writer I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere as interesting to be. But I\u2019m concerned that the material conditions of being British are changing, and these things need confronting.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to Neasden being a borough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
