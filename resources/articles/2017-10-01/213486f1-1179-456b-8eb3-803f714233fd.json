Coleman\u2019s contract runs out next summer and he has previously indicated this would be his last qualifying programme in charge of the team he led to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. \u201cIf you ask any manager after a defeat, you want to be as far away from it as you can,\u201d Coleman said when reminded of that statement. \u201cIt\u2019s six years I\u2019ve been in charge, or coming up to it at Christmas, and I can\u2019t say right now about my future because I\u2019m not thinking about it. I\u2019m thinking about the fact there\u2019s a dressing room full of devastated players and staff. \u201cThe whole nation will be mourning and disappointed because, again, that elusive World Cup has passed us by. There\u2019s a chance I can [stay] and a chance I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t give an answer right now. There will be a conversation in due course and there\u2019s a friendly next month. My contract is until the summer but right now I\u2019m thinking about the experience, I\u2019ll go back to my family and take a bit of time. When the dust settles we\u2019ll see where we go.\u201d James McClean\u2019s 57th-minute winner meant Ireland go into the draw for the play-offs on 17 October, leaving Martin O\u2019Neill celebrating one of the more satisfying nights of his time as national team manager. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem that they troubled us that much,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWhen the ball was in the air we dealt with things reasonably well. When the ball was fizzed in a few times we had to defend but overall it was a great win against a Wales side who did so well at the Euros. \u201cI\u2019ve never doubted the character of the players and their courage was never in doubt. Sometimes we can do better with the ball, but trying to qualify for the World Cup is a monumental task. I knew we\u2019d fight back. And I don\u2019t think anyone would want to play us in the play-offs. \u201cDo I fear teams in it? I don\u2019t think we\u2019d want to play Italy. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d want to play Portugal and there are six others I\u2019d rather not, too. But I\u2019m delighted to be there. I always fear them \u2013 and then we go out and beat them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
