After a season of struggle in the Southern League in which they fell well short of qualifying for the newly formed Conference second division, Hednesford won the Trophy for the first time. Their veteran former Wolves defender Chris Brindley settled an absorbing encounter after conceding the own goal that put Canvey Island in front for the first time. Brindley runs a pub just down the road from Hednesford's Keys Park stadium and if he pulls pints as smoothly as he volleyed on the turn wastage at the Cross Keys must be minimal. \"Where that came from I'll never know,\" said Hednes ford's manager Barry Powell. \"He never struck the ball like that when he was playing in the Football League.\" The 19-year-old winger Anthony Maguire set up that goal and scored the opener. The Islanders struck back with two goals in as many minutes - the unmarked Lee Boylan nodding in the first before a shot from the same player was helped home by Brindley - but Hednesford clinched the Trophy with two goals out of the blue: Les Hines's curling free-kick from distance and Brindley's 20-yard volley. \"The defeat is a disappointment but getting promoted to the Conference means it's mission accomplished this season,\" said Canvey's manager Jeff King. \"In the cold light of day Hednesford would probably swap that for winning today.\" Man of the match: Anthony Maguire (Hednesford Town) Canvey Island (3-4-1-2): Potter; Ward, Cowan, Chenery; Midgley (Berquez, 74), Kennedy, Gooden, Duffy; Minton; Gregory (McDougald, 81), Boylan.
