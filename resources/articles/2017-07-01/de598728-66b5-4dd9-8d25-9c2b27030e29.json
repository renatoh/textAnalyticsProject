He said he was feeling fresh, but you would not have guessed it to look at him. It had been \u201ca pretty quiet night,\u201d he said, \u201cquiet for me, anyway.\u201d The players finished up at around 4am. Gatland did not let on how much sleep he had managed to get. Everyone has their own home remedy for a hangover, a cold shower, a hot breakfast, or some vitamin tablets and a couple of aspirin. Gatland did not need any of these. He was a happy man, proud with what he and his team had achieved \u2013 and that satisfaction was a better morning-after cure than any you can buy over the counter or whistle up in the kitchen. The Lions did not beat the All Blacks, but they came a hell of a lot closer to it than any other team that has been here over the past eight years. The New Zealanders seemed to see the draw as little better than a loss. Steve Hansen, in a telling slip of the tongue, even referred to it that way \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think goal-kicking is the only reason we lost the series\u201d \u2013 but Gatland, on the other hand, reckoned it only a little less than a victory. \u201cIn terms of coming to New Zealand and playing the best team in the world in their own backyard it\u2019s a pretty good achievement,\u201d he said, with characteristic understatement. It was even better than that makes it sound, and he knows it. Gatland has taken a beating these past few weeks. From the Kiwi press, yes, but also from angry fans back home, English convinced that he has a Welsh bias, Irish who figured a similar thing, the Welsh themselves, certain that more of their own players should have been in the starting XV, and the Scots, furious that so few of their fine team had made the tour. Everyone has got an opinion on what the Lions coach is doing wrong. No wonder Graham Henry said it was the hardest job in world rugby. Excuse Gatland his self-satisfaction then, even if he was pushing it when he said: \u201cI think if anyone else was doing it we might not have drawn the series.\u201d Well, he was certainly uniquely qualified for the job. He is the only head coach around with a deep understanding of both these teams, their qualities and cultures. He knows from experience, for instance, how important it is for the Lions midweek team to believe they can play their way into the Test XV, something both Liam Williams and Elliot Daly did over the course of the tour. But more than that, it was Gatland\u2019s understanding of New Zealand that really showed. Long before the tour Sir Ian McGeechan told the Lions board that \u201cyou can\u2019t hope to beat the All Blacks unless you understand the people and their culture, their way of life and attitude to rugby\u201d. So, as the tour manager, John Spencer, explained on Sunday: \u201cWe set a Kiwi to catch a Kiwi.\u201d Gatland\u2019s Waikato roots are so deep that he has said that if you cut him, he would bleed the team colours of red, yellow and black. \u201cIf you have some understanding of the culture you\u2019re going to it gives you a massive advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past people have come to New Zealand and haven\u2019t been quite prepared about culturally what you\u2019re facing.\u201d He mentioned the singing the squad had done. Which might sound a silly thing to bring up, until you see what the great old All Black Bryan Williams had to say about it last week. \u201cI was there were in the meeting house at Waitangi that day, when the Lions sang what we call waiata. Four songs, one from each of the home unions, and everyone did it perfectly. Sometimes you see a group of guys doing that, and a few look bored, a few are uninterested, a few aren\u2019t trying. I was watching them closely, because I\u2019m a student of these things, and the Lions were impeccable. Every one of them. And that\u2019s when I thought: \u2018God, this team is going to be bloody hard to beat.\u2019\u201d They didn\u2019t do all that choir practice just because they like the sound of their own voices. For Gatland, the telling moment was the victory over the Maori All Blacks. \u201cWe heard afterwards that it was hard on the Maoris because they have only been together for 10 days and they hadn\u2019t had much preparation time so we had to feel sorry for them.\u201d He used remarks like these, he explained, to build up his players\u2019 confidence. \u201cThere are strengths in New Zealand as a nation, in terms of the isolation and being so far away, and how that galvanises them to have a go at anything,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cBut there can be cracks at times as well.\u201d He saw more in Steve Hansen\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthe sun would still come up tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world\u201d if the All Blacks lost. \u201cThose are comments that you don\u2019t hear very often coming out of the New Zealand camp,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cYou think: \u2018we can build from that.\u2019 We could create confidence and self-belief because we\u2019d earned that respect from them.\u201d Then there were the tactical changes Hansen made. Gatland argued that \u201cthe thing about the All Blacks is that they are the masters in the past of being the ones who never worry about an opposition\u201d but he noticed this time that \u201cthey picked a team to combat some of our strengths and they don\u2019t normally do those types of things\u201d. When you are playing the All Blacks, Gatland said, the biggest challenge is \u201cgetting 15 players on the field believing they are good enough to win\u201d. Now, it is his biggest achievement, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
