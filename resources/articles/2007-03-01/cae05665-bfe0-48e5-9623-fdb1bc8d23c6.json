The decision to suspend BBC Jam came as a shock - not least to the hundreds of thousands of users drawn to the service since its launch just over a year ago. BBC Jam was the BBC's big push into the world of the \"digital curriculum\". To the BBC, it represented merely an extension of the corporation's 80-year history of schools broadcasting. But to commercial operators already active in the educational publishing marketplace, it appeared a massive threat. So when Tessa Jowell finally approved the launch of BBC Jam in 2003, it was hedged with 18 separate conditions of operation. It also had to be approved by the European Commission in case it represented illegal state aid, which might be occasioned by the use of licence fee cash beyond broadcasting. A content advisory board was established to review the BBC's plans which also had to be shared with commercial competitors - one of which, Learn.co.uk, is owned by the Guardian. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, a chorus of disapproval came from the commercial competitors, who complained that the service was in breach of its licence conditions by being insufficiently differentiated from its rivals. It all culminated in a series of complaints to the EU, which threatened to launch its own inquiry. In order to avoid this, the BBC Trust felt compelled to act. So, while no one in the BBC thinks there is anything wrong with what BBC Jam has tried to do, the way it was set up in the bad old days of the BBC governors has rendered it unworkable. And that is why the trust is now asking the management to come back with \"fresh proposals\" that can be put through the new Public Value Test process, in the hope a service can be launched unencumbered by the need to negotiate continually with its commercial competitors. Who is to blame for the phone-in scandals? When Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan appeared before MPs at the Culture select committee last week, he revealed yet another premium-rate rip off. Callers to C4's Saturday horseracing show, which features pundit John McCririck, were played the wrong message - suggesting the competition was still on when it had already closed - and, critically, were still charged the for the call. He went on to say he hoped the service would be resumed soon but expected it to be with a different provider. The implication was clear - the provider, Eckoh, was at fault. Eckoh issued a statement explaining that, although the wrong message had been mistakenly played, punters would have been charged in any event because of the way C4 had chosen to configure the service. Eckoh's spokesman says C4 was offered the option of giving callers an engaged tone once competitions were closed - meaning they do not pay - but declined. C4 denies this. No doubt its own internal inquiry will get to the bottom of things. Whatever the minutiae, the impression that this scandal has been created by the telephone service providers could not be wider of the mark. What is more, the Blue Peter case, shocking as it is, is probably the least worrying. While you have to wonder what kind of culture the BBC has allowed to develop that could lead anyone to think that kind of fakery was legitimate, the drive by commercial broadcasters to \"monetise\" viewers is much more serious. In the cases of Brainteaser on Five - made by Cheetah, the not inappropriately named division of Endemol UK - and Richard &amp; Judy, made by Cactus for C4, the production companies share the telephone revenues. They are not alone. Some programmes have become little more than adverts for the phone services that generate so much cash. Hence the attempts to keep calls coming by any means - even, apparently, down to creating imaginary winners. Somewhere along the line the cardinal principle of content regulation on commercial television - that advertising and editorial be rigorously separate so as to prevent pollution of the content by commercial concerns - has been forgotten. The broadcasters meanwhile have sat back - happy to take the cash and get cheaper programmes. Make no mistake, the broadcasters are to blame.
