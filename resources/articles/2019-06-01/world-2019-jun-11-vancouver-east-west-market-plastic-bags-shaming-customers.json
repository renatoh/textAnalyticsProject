Customers who don\u2019t bring their own bags to the East West Market in Vancouver will instead have to carry their grocery home in bags reading \u201cWart Ointment Wholesale\u201d or \u201cInto the Weird Adult Video Emporium\u201d. David Lee Kwen, the shop\u2019s owner, insisted that the plan wasn\u2019t to embarrass customers. \u201cWe wanted to give them something humorous, but also something that made them think at the same time,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature not to want to be told what to do.\u201d Kwen initially hoped that a fee on single-use bags would discourage their use. But when the five-cent a bag charge failed to stop people using plastic, he tried a different approach. The bags are meant to force customers to think twice about consumption habits. In a social media post, the store points out that millions of plastic bags are used once before being discarded \u2013 and are part of growing problem of plastic waste. Like countries around the world, Canada is grappling with a deluge of plastics which cannot be recycled and instead end up in landfills. Earlier this week, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced plans to ban single-use plastics in 2021, including grocery bags, plastic cutlery and straws. Kwen admits there may have been an unintended consequence to the bags: \u201cSome of the customers want to collect them because they love the idea of it,\u201d he said. But he still believes the plan is working. \u201cEven if you have the bag, you have to explain its origin to your friends. And then, we\u2019ve started a conversation.\u201d The bags, which Kwen has run in limited numbers of 1,000, cost customers five cents. It costs extra for him to print the newly designed bags so he\u2019s hopeful customers instead opt to bring in their own. In the meantime, he plans to transfer the images on the plastic bags to canvas bags. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword. We wanted to address an issue, but we\u2019ve also made something popular, so it\u2019s turned out great.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
