Collingwood had talked about a new collective before last night's Twenty20 match against West Indies. England, he promised, would \"hunt in packs\" and \"there would be 11 captains out there, not one\". But the heroic Collingwood stood alone like Horatius, scoring 80 from 41 deliveries. And it was not enough. West Indies, in only their second Twenty20 game - it was England's fifth - threw off the miseries of their summer to win their first international game of the tour by 15 runs. And to rub it in Dwayne Bravo, who had been declared unfit to bowl, limped up to send down the final six deliveries. England picked a one-day squad for these matches rather than a specialist Twenty20 one. But they may have to revise their thinking before the Twenty20 World Cup in September. Tonight they must revise their bowling tactics, for here they were inept. \"The West Indies had some great striking of the ball and it was very difficult to bowl to them,\" said Collingwood. \"We showed a lot of fight to get near their score.\" His opposite number, Chris Gayle, wore a wide smile. \"I'm happy with that,\" he said. \"It was a tremendous effort from the guys. Bravo came up to me and said that because of the situation he wanted to bowl - but I've promised the physio that he won't bowl tomorrow.\" By the end the delirious crowd did not seem to mind too much who won, for this was a fine example of the new game. Brevity, once described as the soul of lingerie, is also the essence of the Twenty20 game. A sell-out crowd of 23,500 had shoe-horned themselves into the ancient Oval yesterday to see cricket squeeze a quart into a pint pot. \"You cannot conquer time,\" Auden famously wrote in As I Walked Out One Evening. But Auden died in 1973 and never saw Twenty20 cricket, which has compressed the longest popular game into a three-hour show. This was only the 15th Twenty20 international played, the fourth in Britain and the first in London. But watch those figures grow as the global game embraces a form of cricket that is already the leading brand in the county one-day game. When England set off in pursuit of their target of 209 they looked just as fluent as the West Indians had been. Sixteen came in the third over bowled by Daren Powell, as Matt Prior drove him through the off side for four and then swung him over mid-on for six. But they lost too many wickets early on, including two in the fifth over when Alastair Cook was caught at backward-point and Prior drove into the hands of Powell at long-on off the bowling off Dwayne Smith. They lost their third wicket at 69 in the eighth over when the debutant Jonathan Trott was bowled, leg stump, for nine in as many deliveries. But worse was to follow. Kevin Pietersen had scored only 16 when he was run out by Dwayne Smith - 78 for four in the 10th. Then, at 90, Owais Shah was fifth out, lbw as he shuffled down the pitch to Dwayne Smith. When another debutant, Dimitri Mascarenhas, was caught at short third man after scoring only two, England were 101 for six and looking to their captain. But even when Collingwood was striking Samuels for straight sixes to reach his fifty off only 29 balls the scoring rate needed was going up. England wanted 60 from four overs, 45 from three and 30 from two. But only seven came from the penultimate over, leaving too much to be done in the last. West Indies, who had chosen to bat on a pitch with ample pace and bounce, scored 208 for eight, the fourth highest total in the less than hoary history of the Twenty20 game. Their total was built around two fine innings by Devon Smith, who scored 61 from 34 deliveries with seven fours and three sixes, and Samuels, who hit 51 from 26, with three fours and four sixes, including the magnificent one off Ryan Sidebottom that flew out of the ground over the square-leg boundary. They were supported by good cameos from Shivnarine Chanderpaul (41) and Denesh Ramdin (24). England's catching was excellent, their ground fielding so-so and their bowling surprisingly naive. There was no swing for Jimmy Anderson or Sidebottom but all the faster bowlers bowled too short. There seemed to be a deliberate policy to eschew the yorker and bowl back of a length. And on the sort of true surface their fathers must have told them about, with a fast outfield to match, the West Indians batted gloriously well. England also paid for the omission of Monty Panesar - on the very ground where Surrey's slow left-armer Nayan Doshi has proved to be one of the best bowlers in Twenty20 cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
