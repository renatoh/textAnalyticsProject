When the tickets came through, one of the dates was wrong. I queried it and was told that I would have to pay an extra \u00a3500 to put it right. I assumed the mistake must have been mine and paid up. However, a few days later I went back to the website to add another person to the trip and realised what had happened. The computer had changed the date. ebookers has since changed the system to stop it happening, but I don't see why I should be penalised. Also, I can't understand how it could cost \u00a3100 to change each seat. It has ignored all my requests for a refund. Rev S T Brown, Chippenham, Wilts Internet bookings are great for travel companies because the customer does all the work. However, when that process goes wrong, those same companies often refuse to sort it out. ebookers started by claiming it was all your fault and denied the computer could have changed the dates. However, it later admitted that a system error occurred which did result in an adjustment being made to the dates. \"We accept that this was obviously not picked up by the consumer who proceeded to submit the incorrect details in good faith,\" said a spokeswoman. She said the company will refund the additional costs incurred and she apologised for any inconvenience this has caused. Online refund took six months In May last year we booked four return flights online using the website onlinetravel.com from Leeds/Bradford to Salzburg for departure in February 2006. We paid \u00a3904.74 by credit card the same day. However, last December we were told that the airline was no longer operating the service, and our flights would be cancelled and our money returned. We were told the refund would take six to eight weeks. We have had \u00a336.74 returned but are still waiting for the rest, despite requests via email (there's no phone number). Can you help? MS, Keigthley Whenever I buy things online I always try to use companies that have someone to call for just that reason. Onlinetravel should have been better at explaining what was happening. It appears that an administration error led to a long delay. The cancellation was only logged and the tickets sent back in March of this year, and the refund apparently arrived earlier this week. Online says it would like to apologise for this. A full refund has now been sent, along with an extra \u00a3100 as a gesture of goodwill. Lay-off led to backlog nightmare Because of an operation, I took two months off work to recuperate. I have an Oyster travelcard I use to travel to and from work, but when I applied to get the money back for two months, I met with a bureaucratic nightmare. I had to put my application in writing, but when I rang up I was told there was a two-month backlog of letters that remain unopened. What's going on? I thought the whole thing was supposed to be electronic? AB, London Transport for London says you were wrongly told that there was a two-month delay but concedes that applications such as yours are currently taking a month to process. Your's has now been done and a cheque sent for \u00a3849. TfL also says it is introducing a new web-based system in August that will process claims such as this in 48 hours. We will see whether this happens. Short-changed by extra legroom pledge We booked to fly to Toronto last Christmas with Canadian Affair, swayed by the fact that it was offering reclining seats promising a \"remarkable 35-inch seat pitch\". When we got on the plane, the seats were normal ones and we suffered a very uncomfortable flight. CA has refused any compensation, except to offer a \u00a359 upgrade if we fly again. AR, Bath Canadian Affair says that circumstances beyond its control led it to swap planes but it stands by its decision not to offer any more compensation. It says it completed its part of the bargain by getting you there and back, and claims ABTA guidelines back it up. However, I think a small claims court might see it differently - if you can be bothered to pursue the matter. The compensation offered is only worth something if you plan to fly with CA again. If not, it's worthless. Had the company given you \u00a350, you would have been happier, but the company says its margins are too tight to allow this. Hidden Paris stopover cost a day's delay I booked a flight to Colombia using the STA travel website. Due to an error with its web system, the money left my bank account but the flight was not booked. Luckily, I checked and decided to accept their offer of an alternative flight for an extra \u00a340. However, they neglected to tell me that this meant an overnight stay in Paris and would take much longer. They have offered to pay for a night's accommodation in Paris but are reluctant to do anything further. ET, London This is a similar problem to the one previously and a similar stance was adopted. Only after Capital Letters got involved did STA agree to refund the \u00a340. It still leaves you missing out on a day of a 10-day trip. The moral of the tale is that you should always check the exact details of an alternative offer before agreeing to it, and consider whether you want to use STA again. Name error sparked \u00a3140 surcharge We booked two tickets to fly with BMI Baby but have noticed my partner's surname is incorrect. When you book flights, the computer automatically puts the first surname in all the other passengers' boxes, but my partner has a different name. When we called BMI to change the name, it demanded an extra \u00a3140. We accept our error in not noticing sooner and are happy to pay a \u00a330 admin fee to change it, but cannot accept \u00a3140. AM, Herefordshire BMI Baby is not alone in charging to change the name on an internet booking but it rather bizarrely also makes passengers pay the difference between the new and the old fare at the time of the change. Understandably, you're outraged. It is not as though you are rebooking the flight. BMI defends the practice. In your case, it accepts you made a genuine mistake and has changed your flights for free. All BMI customers be warned. \u00b7 We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
