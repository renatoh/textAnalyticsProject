Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes one and two of the third season \u2013 and if you've seen further ahead, please do not post spoilers. Catch up with Vicky Frost's season two blog A child of Denmark; The Land is Built on Law Welcome back, dear Borgen fans, for this third and final season of the Danish political drama. I admit my heart plummeted at tonight's opening scenes: not only was Birgitte abroad, shunning Danish for English \u2013 not normally a recipe for success \u2013 but those first shots of a super-glamorous Nyborg in a helicopter over Hong Kong, the diary engagements of a successful private sector boss being spelled out, landed with a massive thunk. Was this going to work? Moving from bad dialogue about tiles to her impassioned speech as leader of the New Democrats in a couple of hours was some feat. This first episode was effectively sacrificed to set up Katrine and Kasper's baby and break-up; Birgitte's brilliant life and seemingly stable family set-up; management pressures on the newsroom. All of which made the second hour a very satisfying watch indeed \u2013 but I was glad BBC4 showed this as a double bill. And future episodes look promising. Nyborg has now been wrangled into the perfect narrative position: fighting against all the odds for her principles. Could there be a better starting place than the effective rebirth of that idealistic politician we first fell for? The New Democrats And then there were six \u2026 Birgitte, Nette, Jon, Erik, Bent and Katrine. Hanging around in a grungy unit, drinking instant coffee on hand-me-down chairs and plotting massive political and social change on a single whiteboard. I'm excited by the idea of Nyborg working without the constraints of years of tradition, established party factions or lines. Philip's response to her plan \u2013 a look that said Birgitte was batshit crazy and a delighted guffaw \u2013 was pretty much mine too. Not that it will be straightforward. There is a promising inbuilt tension in this coalition of right, centre and leftish politicians: in Erik's background at the New Right, Jon's slippery reputation and Nette's mistrust of him. I'm still not entirely sure what happened with Bertholson at the party conference. Why was he so embracing Kruse before backing Birgitte? Kruse is, in any case, worried enough to be bumped into offering Nyborg the deputy leadership \u2013 as well he should be, given that he's sold his party's principles down the river. The reinstatement of Sjero in his rightful place at Nyborg's side will presumably trouble the Moderate leader further. I forsee some interesting fights. I hope, too, that we have more of the general political discussion that propelled these episodes forward; there was a real fire in this script about the erosion of civil liberties as immigration laws are pulled ever tighter. (I write this from Australia, where the government's policy of processing those who seek asylum by boat in off-shore camps is truly shocking.) The argument wasn't subtle, particularly where Hoffman was concerned, but sometimes it doesn't need to be. The newsroom Talking of unsubtle \u2026 there wasn't a great deal of nuance going on at TV1, with poor old Torben Friis battling a new boss, Alex Hjort, arrived from Warner Brothers with a sharp haircut, considered stubble, jaunty scarf \u2013 and apparently no ability to differentiate between an imported sitcom and a homemade current affairs programme when it comes to cost and value. These are interesting debates around broadcasting in terms of cost, quality and ratings, but I've always understood TV1 to be a publicly funded channel \u2013 like, in fact, DR1 and BBC4 on which Borgen broadcasts, which adds a little spice. That fact would surely shape this discussion, not least in terms of the number of news hours/programmes the broadcaster is committed to by its charter and the independence of its news, which would probably dull Hjort's arguments somewhat. In any case, I like the idea of Torben defending his ideals against the unpleasant man from Warner Brothers. Both he and Birgitte fighting for the things they strongly believe in. Fingers crossed. Private lives I am more gutted than I expected about Kasper and Katrine no longer being together. It is dramatically satisfying \u2013 Kasper clearly isn't over it, and it leaves Katrine struggling as a single mum to balance priorities and finances, of which more in future blogposts \u2013 but emotionally, it's a bit heartwrenching. Clearly, there is still unfinished business, on Kasper's side at least. Maybe he just couldn't deal with sex on top of Gustav's various noisy toys. Can't say I'd blame him. Philip and Birgitte are looking quite cosy too. Really, DR is a terrible tease with these two, setting up what will surely be a series-long will-they-won't-they storyline driven by the odd hand on shoulder or shared laugh. And the pair's incredible on-screen chemistry, of course. Jeremy seems a bit cold in comparison, though that might be more about Birgitte and him speaking a very particular, buttoned-up English than anything else. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Nice specs, Birgitte! Sidse Babett Knudsen only gets more gorgeous. \u2022 It would be the bloody Guardian, being all liberal and going on about immigration \u2026 \u2022 Something about Jeremy reminds me a bit of Sebastian Coe. Anyone else? \u2022 I love the idea that Laura might follow in her mother's footsteps and become active in politics \u2013 or, at the very least, start advising Birgitte on what younger people want from politicians. \u2022 There is always something quite delicious about an evil telly boss as drawn by those in the telly business. And there are no punches pulled with Alex Hjort. \u2022 Can we talk about hair? Everybody seems more coiffed than before: Birgitte's hair is more luxuriant than ever, Katrina's is perfectly straightened, her mum's is beautifully blown-out, and Kasper's quiff is an unexpected delight. It's a hairdresser's dream. \u2022 Good to see that while Katrina now has a bigger flat, it is just as chaotic as her old one. And that her wall of cuttings and pictures \u2013 which edges ever closer to the rainbow delight of Carrie from Homeland \u2013 remains, albeit with added Gustav pic. \u2022 More housing thoughts: I missed the old Borgen flat. I'm glad to see Birgitte is swapping the massive glass penthouse for something else \u2013 hopefully where the bedroom is off the kitchen. \u2022 Presumably, she'll also be pleased to have a usable office. Nyborg spent a great deal of these episodes outdoors, meeting people at monuments, on bridges, down alleyways, by the harbour. She must have been freezing. (And/or likely to be made minister for Danish tourism.) \u2022 Scarf watch: Hjort taking up the scarf mantle seems an unlikely development, but Katrina has completely abandoned hers and Hanna has downsized. Laura, I'm glad to see, appears to be in training with her gift from Birgitte."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
