Scott\u2019s reported response was as quick-witted and accurate as any of his best double entendres. \u201cNeither,\u201d he grinned. \u201cI\u2019m the lightning flash in the middle.\u201d Many thought Scott, who died in 1980 just as the band was reaching its peak, was irreplaceable. But AC/DC were unstoppable. Substituting their lightning flash for a forward slash named Brian Johnson, they ploughed on and made Back in Black. It was the biggest album of their career, vindicating the band\u2019s resolve. So it would be a foolish writer indeed who ever wrote off AC/DC. They remain unimpeachable as a live act, even if their recordings post Back in Black have never matched the brilliance of their early years (for proof, their give-the-punters-what-they-want shows lean heavily on the roll call of classics from their first six albums). Be that as it may, I can\u2019t bring myself to see them on their Rock or Bust tour, which kicks off its Australian leg in Sydney on Wednesday. For without Malcolm Young, AC have, in effect, lost their DC, the man that made them a true rock and roll \u2013 as distinct from a mere rock \u2013 band. (They\u2019ve also lost drummer Phil Rudd, who brings more nuance and swing to the 4/4 metre than most, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the reasons behind his exclusion.) There is nothing consistent about my stance. I have seen MC5 with Deniz Tek (brilliantly) filling in for Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith on guitar and Evan Dando (lamentably) replacing Rob Tyner on vocals. I have also seen the New York Dolls, with David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain the sole surviving members. Both were enjoyable. And AC/DC have kept it in the family: Angus and Malcolm\u2019s nephew Stevie Young will hold down rhythm guitar on the tour (he also played on the band\u2019s latest album Rock or Bust). He played in the band briefly in the late 1980s, when Malcolm was drying out. Live, when AC/DC are coming at you at 130 decibels, it\u2019s unlikely anyone will notice any difference. So is it plain irrational sentiment that stops me from countenancing the band without their indomitable rhythm guitarist? Yes, Angus is still there (indeed he is the sole remaining original member). To most he is the star of the band and always was, even when Scott stood alongside him. The perpetual schoolboy defines AC/DC\u2019s image. But it was Malcolm who defined AC/DC\u2019s sound. The band is, first and foremost, a rhythm machine: Malcolm\u2019s distinctive chop is inextricable to their identity. While Angus is a thrilling soloist (at least on those early records where his breaks are mostly short, sharp and shocking), Malcolm was all accent, drive and reinforcement. Most of all, he knew when not to play, as this isolated track of Let There Be Rock demonstrates. Silence \u2013 those gaps punctuating the riffs \u2013 was as vital a component of the AC/DC sound as ear-splitting volume. As Angus and Malcolm\u2019s brother George, the band\u2019s co-producer (and ex-Easybeat) once put it, \u201cIt\u2019s the stops what rocks.\u201d Think of the long list of AC/DC riffs which made use of those stops: Highway to Hell, Whole Lotta Rosie, You Shook Me All Night Long, It\u2019s a Long Way to the Top, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Jailbreak. These are the songs that have made them a juggernaut for over 30 years (their Black Ice tour grossed US$441m). It is sad beyond words that Malcolm Young, who is suffering from dementia, is no longer able to remember the riffs that made his band immortal. It is frankly unbelievable \u2013 and heroic beyond measure \u2013 that on his last tour with the band, before every show, he had to teach himself each song again before taking the stage. No one else who cares will ever forget those songs. And there is no right or wrong way for AC/DC, or their fans, to honour the legacy of their fallen comrades. As Rock or Bust suggests, it\u2019s not AC/DC\u2019s way to admit defeat, ever. The show will go on, maybe for the last time, to pay tribute to the man who made them what they are. But while I don\u2019t begrudge them for an second, neither do I want to see AC/DC reduced to a tribute to themselves. For those about to rock, I salute you. But on the night they come to my town, I\u2019ll stay home, crank Let There Be Rock up to 11 and have a drink to Malcolm \u2013 the greatest rhythm guitarist of them all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
