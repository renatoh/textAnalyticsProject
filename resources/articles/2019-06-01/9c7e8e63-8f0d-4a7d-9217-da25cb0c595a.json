Justices came to that conclusion after the designer Erik Brunetti\u2019s fashion line ran into trouble with the US patent and trademark office (PTO), which registers product names. Brunetti was seeking a trademark for his brand, FUCT, which he says is pronounced letter by letter. (The brand\u2019s Twitter bio suggests it stands for \u201cfriends U can\u2019t trust.) But the trademark office wasn\u2019t thrilled with the branding and turned down Brunetti\u2019s registration, under a law banning \u201cimmoral or scandalous matter\u201d. In the words of PTO authorities, FUCT was \u201ca total vulgar\u201d [sic]. But Brunetti battled the PTO decision, and the dispute made its way through the legal system to the highest court in the land. The supreme court accepted that anyone who read FUCT as a swear word \u201cwould hardly be alone\u201d. Faced with claims that the word was not, in fact, a total vulgar, Justice Samuel Alito replied: \u201cOh, come on.\u201d The word was banned from use in court. Still, on Monday, the court found that the trademark office should keep its personal feelings to itself \u2013 and Alito joined in the opinion. The law violates the first amendment\u2019s protections for free speech, the court said in its decision, emphasizing that deciding whether trademarks are \u201cimmoral\u201d means discriminating \u201con the basis of viewpoint\u201d. In an opinion delivered by Elena Kagan, the court considered the definitions of \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cscandalous\u201d, concluding that the law in question, the Lanham Act, \u201callows registration of marks when their messages accord with, but not when their messages defy, society\u2019s sense of decency or propriety \u2026 \u2018Love rules\u2019? \u2018Always be good\u2019? Registration follows. \u2018Hate rules\u2019? \u2018Always be cruel\u2019? Not according to the Lanham Act\u2019s \u2018immoral or scandalous\u2019 bar.\u201d Kagan went on to cite some examples: the PTO was fine with \u201csay no to drugs \u2013 reality is the best trip in life\u201d, but it nixed \u201cyou can\u2019t spell healthcare without THC\u201d for pain relievers and advertising \u201cbong hits 4 Jesus\u201d. Now that justices have struck down the ban on \u201cimmoral and scandalous\u201d words, Brunetti can get his trademark \u2013 and other questionable brand names should have an easier time getting trademarks of their own. The Trump administration had argued that undermining the law would lead to a market flooded with shocking language and images. But all nine justices agreed that a ban on \u201cimmoral\u201d speech stood in the way of free expression. (Three justices, however, felt the ban on \u201cscandalous\u201d trademarks should stand, and Alito suggested that future congressional action could target trademarks \u201ccontaining vulgar terms that play no real part in the expression of ideas\u201d.) Brunetti\u2019s lawyer hailed the decision in a news release, acknowledging that \u201cmany Americans are uncomfortable with Brunetti\u2019s trademark\u201d. But \u201cthe question is whether any government gets to impose its views about what is moral and suppress those it finds distasteful. That is a road that we, as Americans, should not go down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
