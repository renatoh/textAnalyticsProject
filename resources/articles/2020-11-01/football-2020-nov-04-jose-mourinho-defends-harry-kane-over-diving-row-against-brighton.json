Tottenham\u2019s manager was responding to claims that Kane manufactured a penalty during Sunday\u2019s home win over Brighton. The former England internationals Gary Lineker and Martin Keown were among those who criticised Kane for deliberately positioning himself to make contact with Adam Lallana unavoidable, while making no attempt to win the ball. \u201cHarry Kane win a penalty?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re speaking about players at other clubs, and they do it and they do it so well, but for sure you\u2019re not speaking about Harry Kane. Harry Kane was in a position to control the ball in a dangerous position and Lallana comes in, a very dangerous action, and commits a foul. Lallana was reckless. He made a mistake. \u201cSpeak about Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, clever guys where somebody blows on them and they are on the floor. Speak about those guys, not Harry Kane. When I say I want my team to be clever I\u2019m not speaking about winning penalties, I\u2019m talking about winning 2-1 against a very difficult Brighton and controlling the end of the game.\u201d Kane has insisted he \u201ctried to put my body in between the player to shield the ball\u201d and that Lallana \u201cjumped into the back of me with quite a bit of force\u201d. Mourinho\u2019s defence of Kane follows J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s denial that Mohamed Salah dived to earn a penalty against West Ham on Saturday. Tottenham\u2019s manager was speaking before Thursday\u2019s Europa League game away to Ludogorets and believes it is vital to avoid defeat following last week\u2019s loss at Royal Antwerp. Spurs will be without Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, who has a non-Covid virus, as well as the injured \u00c9rik Lamela and Serge Aurier, after a poor display in Belgium where \u201cwe were waiting for the victory to find us, not for us to find the victory\u201d. Tanguy Ndombele missed the Antwerp match but is in line to feature against the Bulgarian side. After a difficult first season in north London the Frenchman has become a much more integral member of the team this term, starting 71% of league matches compared with last year\u2019s 32%. Moussa Sissoko, who has described Ndombele as \u201cmy little brother\u201d, says the player is finally settled and content. \u201cYou can see this year he\u2019s happy to be part of the team and showing his quality on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people need time to adapt and Tanguy needed that time. Now the past has gone, he\u2019s doing well, he\u2019s happy, and everyone is happy with what he\u2019s doing.\u201d But Mourinho, who was publicly critical of the 23-year-old last season, remains guarded in his praise of a player who is yet to complete a full league game this campaign. \u201cI was not happy at all with what he was giving us [last season] but in this moment I am happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think he can do better, his potential is huge. So is he doing well? Yes. Am I happy with him? Yes. But I think he can do more, he can be fitter, he can give us 90 minutes without problems, he can be better than he is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
