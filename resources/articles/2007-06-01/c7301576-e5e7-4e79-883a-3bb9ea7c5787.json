The environment secretary, David Miliband, chose the white cliffs of Dover to launch the proposals, which would extend the right to roam established by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Thousands of property owners in England and Wales will be contacted by the countryside watchdog Natural England to negotiate details of the continuous coastal route, including the royal family, whose Sandringham estate in Norfolk still bars walkers from several miles of picturesque seashore. Mr Miliband said: \"We are an island nation. The coast is our birthright and everyone should be able to enjoy it. I want families to have safe and secure access to walk, climb, rock-scramble, paddle and play all along our coastline. \"The success of the right to roam on open countryside, established by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act in 2000, has shown that people are responsible about increased access and want to enjoy it in a mature way. That greatly encourages us to press ahead with opening up the coast.\" Although Scotland has a well-established corridor, which has been used as a model for the new scheme, 30% of England's 2,500 miles of coast is still private and forms the main target of the reform. The consultation will cover route width for the main path, which is unlikely to exceed 10 metres, and exemptions for sensitive wildlife sites. But the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs wants to limit diversions as far as possible. Measures to allow the path to be moved inland away from eroding cliffs are also up for debate, as is the longterm hope of \"rolling agriculture back from the coast\" by encouraging a wide strip of uncultivated or ungrazed land. Mr Miliband said that compensation for loss of property value - which has been the main issue for objectors - was not thought to be a major concern. He said: \"We are not talking about people having to face crowds walking over their lawns. \"People want access to the coast because they love it, not because they want to damage it. Walkers along parts of the coast which have previously been barred are more likely to pick up litter than to leave it.\" Completion of the unbroken path around the shoreline is expected to cost \u00a350m over 10 years. The robust line was welcomed by Natural England. Its chairman, Sir Martin Doughty, said: \"The path would allow everyone to enjoy the coast with confidence and certainty.\" The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds also backed the plan but warned that detours round breeding sites would be essential. Gwyn Williams, the RSPB's head of reserves and protected areas, said: \"Managed properly, access should increase visitors' understanding of the benefits of wildlife conservation.\" Criticism of the proposals, which were broadly welcomed, was muted. But Damian Cleghorn, public policy officer at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, warned: \"The government needs to think carefully before moving forward with this policy. A corridor of public access could have a damaging impact on sensitive environmental areas, creating 'tourist hotspots' which threaten the biodiversity of the coastline. \"Ruling out compensation for landowners is also punitive given that security and safety problems are likely to result in the fall of property values.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
