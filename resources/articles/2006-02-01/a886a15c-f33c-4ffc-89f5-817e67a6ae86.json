My old school friend Beverley Dalton lived on a farm in Charing in Kent. I had my first kiss with a guy who she knew in one of the barns among the hay. It's a shame such opportunities are wasted on the young. Looks important? For me, yes, but good looks alone do not make a man sexy. They also need a fantastic smile and sparkling eyes - with a personality to match. Flirting tip? Lots of smiling and plenty of eye contact, too. Dating rules? Allowing the sexual tension to build before having sex always makes it much more exciting, so never on the first date for me. I prefer spending time with my friends to being with the wrong person even for just one night. Age difference? I think it is important not to have too many restrictions. I've always gone out with men who are slightly younger than me. One ex-partner was actually 17 years younger than I was. It seemed to surprise some people at the beginning of our relationship, but we were together for five years. A while back I was asked out by an ex-England football player, who was eight years older than me and absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately I had already started seeing someone else, otherwise I would definitely have got involved. Most romantic song?
