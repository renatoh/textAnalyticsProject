The AC Milan and Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder came off the bench at half-time and helped set up a goal for Wayne Rooney as Fabio Capello's men enjoyed an impressive build-up to Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine. Beckham, 33, admitted it has been some journey for him - taking in Manchester United and Real Madrid, as well as the England captaincy along the way. \"I am very proud. When you grow up, you dream about playing for your country and at Wembley,\" he said. \"To play 109 times for England is obviously very special for me and for my family. I dedicate it to my family, because they are the ones who have been through the ups and downs of my career and been there for the good times and also the bad times. It has been a roller coaster, but it has been a special night tonight. All my family were here, so it meant a lot.\" Beckham replaced Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon for the second half, and had an impact when he crossed for Rooney's headed goal on 70 minutes. He said: \"When you are on the bench you hope to come on and either secure the game or make a difference and produce an 'assist'. I was lucky enough tonight to get in positions where I put a couple of good balls in.\" Beckham hopes to be involved for the next World Cup in South Africa, and even beyond. He said: \"The target is just to play, be involved in every game possible. I have already said I'd love to play in another World Cup - or two - but we will have to wait and see. That is a long way away at the moment.\" Beckham was satisfied with England's efforts against Slovakia. It was a good performance tonight, but now our minds are on Wednesday against Ukraine,\" he added. England captain John Terry praised Beckham. \"It is brilliant for David,\" said the Chelsea defender. \"He comes on and always makes the difference - that is the quality he brings to the squad. David has determination and fight, and can go on forever. He has given the manager food for thought, that is for sure.\" Aston Villa forward Emile Heskey gave England an early lead, only to then go off injured - followed by his replacement Carlton Cole. Manchester United striker Rooney made it 2-0 with 20 minutes left, before Frank Lampard added a third and Rooney a fourth in stoppage time. Beckham said: \"We started off well, and set the tone for the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
