But Scott McDonald's opener shortly before half-time and Georgios Samaras's second soon after, allied to the controversial ordering-off of visiting defender Jerel Ifil, brought a pronounced imbalance before Samaras completed his double. Celtic once again showed from the start that there is nothing wrong with their ambition, demonstrating a willingness to carry the ball into forward areas at every opportunity in the attempt to regain the advantage at the top of the league that Rangers had snatched with their lunchtime 3-1 victory at Falkirk. But, until McDonald's intervention close to half-time \u2013 and not for the first time in this trying season \u2013 Tony Mowbray's players revealed serious weaknesses in the matter of exploiting promising positions and opportunities. In this respect, Aiden McGeady was once again too often a worrying letdown. The Ireland midfielder is blessed with all the natural ball skill anyone could wish for but it is his misfortune that he seems so frequently not to have the game appreciation to match. An incident midway through the first half rather typified his most telling flaw. Released down the right by an impeccable pass from Marc Crosas, McGeady drove forward, his head typically in the lowered position. When he reached his destination, about 12 yards out to the right of goal, he looked up for the first time and seemed quite stuck for options. In the absence of an alternative, he simply hit the ball wide of the near post. No such uncertainty existed in the mind of McDonald \u2013 a more natural predator \u2013 when he was given his chance by Andreas Hinkel. The Germany full-back received an incisive crossfield pass from Crosas on the right side of the area and quickly played the ball across to the inside-left position. There, McDonald arrived with impeccable timing to hit the shot on a full stride and send it over the line off the hands of the grasping Jamie Langfield. It would be McGeady, atoning for previous disappointments, who would supply Samaras for the second. A simple chip from the left and the tall Greece striker, quite isolated, had merely to twitch his neck muscles to send the header past Langfield from three yards. If that second goal effectively marked the end of Aberdeen's prospects of redeeming even a point from the match, the dismissal of Ifil that followed three minutes later would leave them scrambling to keep the margin of defeat from becoming embarrassing. The English defender seemed to be sent off as a consequence of injudicious refereeing. Ifil's initial collision with Samaras was innocuous enough but, grounded, he did lift his feet to the Celtic man and caught him lightly on the thigh. It looked a booking at worst, but referee Mike Tumilty signalled to play on, clearly gesturing to Samaras to get up. But the stand-side linesman, James Bee, summoned the referee and must have told him that Ifil had committed an offence. Tumilty then seemed to compound his earlier error on the side of leniency by turning to the draconian and showing the player the red card. Maurice Ross contributed to the rearguard action by heading Glenn Loovens's powerful header off the line, but the third was merely delayed. McGeady's long ball out of his own half was taken down by Samaras, who then clipped it on the volley past Langfield from six yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
