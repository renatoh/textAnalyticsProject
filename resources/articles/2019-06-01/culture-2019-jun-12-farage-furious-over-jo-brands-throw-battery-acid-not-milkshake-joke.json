Brand, who joined the Heresy talk show on Radio 4 as a guest on Tuesday, joked about throwing battery acid at \u201cunpleasant characters\u201d instead of milkshakes. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit party and one of several European election candidates that had milkshakes thrown on them in recent weeks, tweeted: \u201cThis is incitement of violence and the police need to act.\u201d On the show, Brand said: \u201cWhy bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\u201d The comedian went on to say she was joking and not a fan of the milkshake stunts. \u201cThat\u2019s just me. I\u2019m not going to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry.\u201d However, this part was edited out of a clip that was widely shared online. The BBC said jokes made on Heresy were \u201cdeliberately provocative as the title implies\u201d, and they were \u201cnot intended to be taken seriously\u201d. Heresy\u2019s host, Victoria Coren Mitchell, defended Brand. She tweeted that Heresy was \u201csupposed to be a show that stimulates debate\u201d and she believed \u201call people should be free to make jokes about anything\u201d. Coren Mitchell said the same show, the first of the series after a three-year hiatus, contained a joke about the Holocaust and her relatives and that \u201cnobody\u201d had complained about that. In response to Farage\u2019s criticism, Coren Mitchell said: \u201cNigel! I\u2019m genuinely disappointed. We don\u2019t agree on everything, but I would totally have had you down as a free speech man. Especially when it comes to jokes.\u201d The remain campaigner Femi Oluwole joined Coren Mitchell in accusing Farage of double standards, and responded to his tweet about Brand\u2019s comments with a video showing Farage saying he would be forced to \u2018\u201cpick up a rifle\u201d if Brexit wasn\u2019t delivered. Others sided with Farage, among them Kevin Maguire, the associate editor of the Daily Mirror, who called Brand\u2019s quip \u201cdangerous and unfunny\u201d, and \u201ca mistake in the current climate\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to remove references to the \u201cfar-right\u201d in the text and subheading."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
