But once the music starts, all the affectations drop away and Kennedy reverts to what he has always been, one of the best violinists around. The Elgar Concerto is one of his great party pieces and this performance, with Paul Daniel and the BBC Concert Orchestra in a packed Albert Hall, had a special energy and nervous intensity. The basic tempo for the first movement was faster than I've ever heard, but Kennedy made it work, not only by the breathtaking precision of his articulation, but because he knew instinctively when to give the music the chance to breathe and when to pause for reflection in its more expansive moments. His shaping of the second subject, the so-called \"Windflower\" theme, was exquisitely refined, and his pianissimo playing here and in the slow movement was meltingly beautiful, before everything was swept up into the whirling finale, the long cadenza full of magical asides and perfectly shaded confidences. Daniel had taken over the concert from an ailing Vernon Handley, and retained his typically all-British programme. Bax's tone poem The Garden of Fand - Debussyan impressionism given a Celtic twist - and Finzi's Intimations of Immortality, preceded the Elgar. If the Bax could have done with a bit more orchestral refinement, the mood of the Wordsworth setting - Finzi's most substantial score with echoes of Vaughan Williams, Holst and even Walton - was caught exactly, with tenor Andrew Kennedy and the BBC Symphony Chorus slotting easily into its portrait of infinite, lingering nostalgia. \u00b7 The Proms continue until September 13.
