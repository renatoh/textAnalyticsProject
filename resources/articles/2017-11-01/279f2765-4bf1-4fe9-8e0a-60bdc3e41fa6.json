In an excoriating report, the expert committee said it was concerned about the conditions in the offshore immigration processing facilities in Manus Island and Nauru, which also holds children, \u201cincluding inadequate mental health services, serious safety concerns and instances of assault, sexual abuse, self-harm and suspicious deaths; and about reports that harsh conditions compelled some asylum seekers to return to their country of origin despite the risks that they face there\u201d. Instances of refugees and asylum seekers being encouraged to return to places where they might face danger \u2013 a breach of Australia\u2019s non-refoulement obligations under international law - have previously been reported by the Guardian. At the height of the Myanmarese military\u2019s \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d operation against the minority Muslim Rohingya population, Rohingya held in Australia\u2019s offshore regime were being encouraged to return to Myanmar with offers of up to $25,000 in cash if they abandoned their claim for protection. The human rights committee \u2013 an 18-member expert panel \u2013 said Australia exercised \u201ceffective control\u201d over the offshore regime and should close it immediately. Australia should end the practice of \u201coffshore processing\u201d, immediately close Nauru and Manus Island, and \u201ctake all measures necessary to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers affected ... ensure their transfer to Australia or their relocation to other appropriate safe countries\u201d. The committee said Australia\u2019s policy of mandatory \u2013 and in some cases indefinite \u2013 detention of asylum seekers was unlawful. Mandatory detention, including of children, was instituted by the Keating Labor government in 1992 as a temporary measure. A 273-day time limit on detention was abandoned in 1994. During hearings last month, Australia was castigated for its routine refusals to implement the findings of the committee. Prof Yuval Shany, the committee\u2019s vice-chair, said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Australia to \u201croutinely reject\u201d the committee\u2019s views or \u201cself-judge\u201d international human rights treaties, telling Australia it could not \u201cpick and choose\u201d which laws it followed and which rights it wanted to uphold. The committee also condemned Australia\u2019s \u201cmarginalising and stigmatising\u201d postal survey on marriage equality, saying it was \u201cnot an acceptable decision-making method\u201d; the low age (as young as 10) of criminal responsibility in some states; and the persistently high rates of Indigenous incarceration, in particular mandatory sentencing laws, and allowing imprisonment for fine defaults. Australia\u2019s confronting appraisal comes as its asylum policies reach new domestic and international attention. Australia was last month elected \u2013 in an uncontested \u201cclean slate\u201d poll \u2013 to the powerful UN human rights council, but the ascension brought criticism of its sustained breaches of international human rights laws. And refugees and asylum seekers in the Manus Island detention centre are currently embroiled in a standoff with Australian and Papua New Guinea authorities who are attempting to force them to move to new accommodation in the Manus community. Men have been living more than a week without food, running water, electricity or medicine. The UN high commissioner for refugees has described the situation as a \u201chumanitarian emergency\u201d. Several attacks and incidents have marred recent months and the 600 men refusing to leave say they are not safe in the local community. Independent observers say the proposed new housing is inadequate and unfinished. PNG immigration has given the men until Saturday to accede to moving, or face being forcibly removed. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, blamed refugee advocates for the impasse, saying they were \u201cencouraging these people not to move\u201d. \u201cI think that the responsible course of action is to encourage them to comply with the lawful requests and requirements of the PNG authorities,\u201d he said. GetUp\u2019s human rights co-director Shen Narayanasamy, who spent time inside the now-closed detention centre, said death or serious illness was inevitable in coming days. \u201cThe conditions are appalling and it\u2019s obvious you wouldn\u2019t choose to stay here if you thought you could be safer elsewhere. \u201cThere is a great threat of violence from the PNG army, and the Manus island community has made it very clear it doesn\u2019t want the men to move into accommodation closer to town.\u201d The executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser, said Manus remained on a knife edge, and Australia was responsible for protecting those held there. \u201cInstead, the Australian government has cut food, power and water. These innocent men are in great danger but they have nowhere safe to go. They\u2019re terrified of violence if they stay. They\u2019re terrified of violence if they leave. These men deserve a future, but instead of bringing them to safety, our government is trying to bludgeon them into returning to persecution or moving from one dead-end camp to another.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
