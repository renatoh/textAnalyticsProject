And so it proves. Tamara Rojo is waiting, standing by a wall with a cap pulled low over her face, but the posture gives her away: straight-backed and self-contained as people rush past trailing luggage and children. Rojo has just returned from Barcelona, where she was picking up another award to add to her collection, and I'm to interview her in the taxi on her way to the headquarters of English National Ballet in Kensington, where she is its new artistic director. It's the only time she has in a day that starts with ballet classes at 10am, followed by hours of rehearsal, then administrative work. The new season opens in less than two weeks and people will be waiting to see if this first-time artistic director has what it takes to lead Britain's second-biggest ballet company in challenging times, as funding cuts begin to bite. The ENB is a touring company that loses \u00a3100,000 a week on the road, and has been criticised for preferring a narrower, commercial repertoire over creativity (and has already seen the departure of two artistic directors within 10 years). Rojo's new job won't have come as a surprise to anyone who follows dance \u2013 she has long talked of her wish to go into direction, and was tipped to be the next director of the Royal Ballet when Monica Mason retired last year, although it went to Kevin O'Hare. Less than a year later, Rojo \u2013 the Royal Ballet's Spanish prima ballerina \u2013 got the job at ENB instead. \"I was thinking the other day that all of my career dancing has really just been a preparation for this,\" she says. \"I have been very fortunate to have danced and worked with amazing people, but now it's a moment to make it bigger than me. Your actions can have an effect beyond yourself, and more importantly into the art form itself, and hopefully into society too. I like the fact that you can change the world a little, bring it to more people. We're doing dance for Parkinson's [they run classes for people with the disease] and outreach work for children.\" The Sleeping Beauty, which opens ENB's season in Milton Keynes, and the Nutcracker are there to pay the bills, but she has made decisions to stage other more interesting choices too, such as the company's premiere of Petite Mort, Jiri Kylian's contemporary choreography featuring fencing foils, in the spring, and a selection of pieces that make up A Tribute to Rudolf Nureyev next summer. She is hoping to work more with choreographers, and I doubt it will be long before she puts her considerable networking skills to use. \"I think that's something that I missed in my career \u2013 there weren't many opportunities to work with creators,\" she says. \"I felt sometimes it was a little bit frustrating to replicate something that was already created. To a certain extent, Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty and other classics are old enough that you are freer, that you can really interpret them a bit like Shakespeare \u2013 however you want. \"The problem with choreographies that were done 10 or 20 years ago is that the people who created them are still around, and quite attached to them, so it's more difficult to put your own stamp on what you think this ballet should look like. I want to give more opportunities to dancers at the company to work directly with creators and bring out whatever they have.\" These jobs come up rarely, so she had to grab it, but Rojo still insists the timing was right, though many would disagree. At 38, she is at the peak of her powers as a dancer \u2013 \"this is the best time,\" she admits. \"I have reached the technical climax, but most importantly the emotional maturity. You really know what you are doing. It's quite a wonderful feeling.\" And yet she is walking away. She will still be performing with the ENB \u2013 and will go back to the Royal Ballet next year for her farewell performances \u2013 but being at a smaller company means missing out on roles there isn't the money to do. \"But life is full of choices,\" she says. \"You can't hold on to something, you have to let go so that new things can arrive. This was a new adventure. I had been at Covent Garden for 12 years, I had done many fantastic roles. I was at the peak, and the only way is down.\" She laughs. \"It's better to jump off while you're at the peak and jump to the next challenge.\" It doesn't feel like a sacrifice, she insists. \"It was going to happen one day, and the nice thing is I chose when, rather than it walking away from me, which could have happened at any time.\" For an audience, Rojo is dazzling \u2013 she has been praised for her acting as well as her technical brilliance as a dancer, and emotional depth \u2013 but she says she was wary of becoming a little bored. \"Not with the art form, but bored with myself \u2013 bored with being by myself in a studio for hours on end, analysing things that I had already analysed many times before. There was a point where I felt I was imitating myself, pretending I was interested, but had so many other things in my mind.\" Because she had reached the highest level and there was nowhere else to go? She nods. \"I had reached my own limit, reached what I could do in most of those roles. I had thought about [how to perform the role], come to a conclusion, and in my opinion, it was the best possible conclusion, so I wasn't going to go through the exercise again. So things that before would have taken four weeks to prepare were now taking two weeks, or even in 10 days if I was really fit. The good thing about coming to English National Ballet is it gives me a new range of repertoire, so I have to start again at that point of investigation, which I really enjoy.\" She says she still loves performing, \"but really truly good performances are few and far between \u2013 I can maybe count 10 in my whole career.\" Most of the time, she says with a laugh: \"I come out slightly disappointed with myself.\" I ask her what makes a great performance, and she thinks for a moment. \"It's an alchemy, something beyond your control. It's almost like you come out of yourself, you become something bigger than yourself. You gel with the public, with your partner, with the music. Some of those great shows haven't been technically spotless, but something else did take over.\" The first time she remembers feeling that was when she was 18, performing Giselle in Spain. \"At some point things just clicked, and I was Giselle.\" And in that constant pursuit of that one magical night, perhaps only the 11th time in a career spanning more than 20 years, \"you keep working. That's the hook, that's what you're always practising for. That magic can only happen when you are relaxed and you can only be relaxed when you feel like you are in control. It's delusional because you are never in control, but you think you are because you have done weeks of rehearsals and practice and know, 'Yes, I can do this.' That is when you let go of yourself.\" Rojo grew up in Madrid. Her parents \u2013 her father was an industrial engineer, her mother a finance director \u2013 were anti-Franco activists who were puzzled by their young daughter's passion for ballet, ignited when she was five. Rojo's drive and work ethic (she said recently she was \"not the best ballerina, but I was the most bloody-minded\") is much remarked on \u2013 was she like that as a child? \"Only in ballet. I was rather lazy in everything else. I wouldn't walk! My parents told me I was constantly asking to be carried. I hated physical activity of any kind.\" She laughs. \"I hated school. I think if I hadn't found ballet I would have been rather a lazy person.\" What did she like about it? \"It made me feel free. I didn't like talking very much. I think dancing felt like the one place I could be truly free.\" It was a surprise when her mother took her to see a performance of Swan Lake \u2013 Rojo didn't know you could be a professional ballerina, and the realisation that ballet was \"public\" frightened her. \"I didn't like it at all. I thought it was a travesty. \"For me, ballet was a personal experience, something I felt when I was in the studio, and the thought that people would be watching me felt intrusive. I thought: 'Maybe this isn't what I want to be, I'm not confident being watched while I have this personal experience.'\" But she came to terms with performing and, as a teenager, Rojo was doing six hours of ballet a day alongside school. At 20, she won the prestigious Paris International Dance competition, \"and I realised that maybe I was OK and I could make it.\" One of the judges, Galina Samsova, offered Rojo a place at Scottish Ballet, where she arrived with little English. Her abilities were soon recognised by other companies \u2013 she joined ENB, and then the Royal Ballet in 2000, where she stayed for 12 years as a principal dancer, becoming a star. We arrive at the English National Ballet building and go upstairs to her office. \"It is strange to be back, after all this time,\" she says. I stay and talk in the dressing room attached to her office while she puts makeup on for the photographs. A huge pile of satin pointe shoes weighs down a shelf. It's a cliche that ballerinas have to endure great suffering for their art, but there are sacrifices. Rojo, who has had injuries, says she is in pain every day. \"Always. Somewhere. You get used to it. It's like a noise, a hum somewhere, and because it's constant you ignore it, but you learn when it changes sound and you need help.\" She has been outspoken before about the pressures on ballerinas to conform to a very thin aesthetic, pressures she has experienced, \"sometimes very explicitly: 'You're too fat.' At the time it was painful, and I believed the words because they were [from] people who, in theory, wanted the best for me. And sometimes I did starve myself and that's when I realised actually I'm losing my technique, my strength. I don't want to be a 'fake' dancer who is pretending to jump but is not using the muscles because she has no energy. I stopped enjoying dancing, so what was the point.\" Rojo has hinted in the past at how the workload and its emotional intensity can be tough on relationships, although she says today, \"I don't think it's any harder than for anyone else. I think having relationships is just difficult, for many reasons.\" She laughs. \"I'm lucky, I'm happy, but it was a question of finding someone [her partner is a lighting designer] who shares my interests.\" Rojo has a big role ahead of her, and although she brings the perfect package of drive, vision and box-office appeal, it won't be easy. The financial situation \u2013 the ENB has had its Arts Council funding cut by 15% \u2013 \"will affect the choices we have to make,\" she says. \"Governments and people who make these decisions have to realise that yes, you might still have ballet companies, but it's going to be rare that they can take big creative risks that mean the art form continues to be alive and healthy. But hopefully we can do a bit of both. The question is, how long can we sustain that?\" I'm about to leave her to sit on the floor and tape up her toes ready for class. \"Art gives hope,\" she says with a smile, \"and in moments like this, it's more necessary than ever.\" The Sleeping Beauty is at Milton Keynes Theatre 17-20 October, then touring. The Nutcracker is at Southampton Mayflower, 22-25 November, and London Coliseum, 12 December to 5 January. www.ballet.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
