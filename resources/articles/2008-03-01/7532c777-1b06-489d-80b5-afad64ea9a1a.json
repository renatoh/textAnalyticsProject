Last year, when the violence was at its peak, we used to lock the door of our bedroom in the hospital and sometimes wouldn't open it even when patients knocked at the door. Yet, even in those darkest times, I still said to my colleagues, even if we end up killed, it is better than living a day under Saddam Hussein. Life was difficult for people employed by the government before the war, such as doctors, engineers, teachers, civil servants. Now things have improved a bit for them in terms of their salaries, even though prices have risen as well. Now we can buy electronic and other house instruments that we couldn't afford for a long time. There is a shortage of medical instruments, broken instruments don't get replaced and shortages of medicine are worse than when there were sanctions. The other problem is that most qualified medical professors have either left the country or have been killed. Immediately after the war, I used to call it a war of liberation. Others called it an occupation. Now I believe that 50 per cent of each of those terms was correct. The storekeeper Adil Al-Meshhedani, 63 Al-Meshhedani, a Sunni, is married with one son and two married daughters. He lives in the city of Ramadi in Anbar province, central Iraq, and works as a storekeeper at a government firm selling building materials. My son has been in jail for more than two years. He was in his final year in school and has done nothing wrong. I want the general pardon that the Iraqi authorities are issuing soon for prisoners to include those in US-run jails. I have become sick because of sadness over the imprisonment of my son and now I have heart problems and cannot see very well. My salary is low and my wife goes all the way down to Basra to visit my son in Buka jail, but it costs us quite a lot. I was jailed for four years in Saddam's time because I was accused of tearing up a photo of him and cursing him - but I didn't do it. Our lives are now excellent. Our tribal leaders are doing a great job. It is also very secure. I can go out in the night and walk around or go to the market with no problems. The police would stop any misbehaviour immediately. Construction is going on at a good pace, like paving roads and building schools, but there are still difficulties. The teacher Amaal Al-Zubeidi, 49 Mother of six. She teaches clinical biochemistry and lives in Baghdad. The other day a patient was brought into the hospital who had a blood clot and, shockingly, the medicine for dissolving clots was not available. When I asked the officials there, they said that they give quantities of the medicine to the emergency room, but it gets stolen by some of the workers in the hospital and gets sold in the black market. Even at work we are terrified, not only for ourselves but for our children and husbands. Security is the most difficult problem here, while money is not a major problem as it comes and goes. It is true that some people are very poor in this society, but I know many people who would prefer to live in poverty if they were given security. My skills are widely needed, but I can't go everywhere because I have to be home before dark. My brother was killed by a stray bullet and one of my nephews received a bullet in his back, but he survived. I sent my children to Syria when things got so bad, but now things are a bit better, so I brought them here again, then changed their schools to safer ones. I wish the Multi-National Forces would leave my country right away, because I believe that Iraqis feel like brothers about each other but it was the occupation who planted this hatred and differences between us. We didn't have it before the war and we didn't even think about it. Mixed marriages were very common. Apart from planting sectarian hatred among us, there are the horrible crimes that these forces have committed, like when the Blackwater security company killed innocent people, or when those American soldiers raped that poor girl, killed her along with her family, and then set the place on fire to try to cover their crime. The security improvement that was achieved during the surge gave me a lot of hope and I was thinking of bringing my son back to Baghdad from the safe province I sent him to. But now hope is disappearing and I am noticing a deterioration in the security situation again. We are starting to hear again of kidnappings, killings and bombs. The border guard Talal Al-Khafaji, 30 A professional basketball player before the war, Khafaji now plays basketball for Iraq's border security force and lives with his mother and eight siblings in Baghdad. He is a Shia. I really wish the invasion had not happened and Saddam was still in power and we can live like we used to. We have gone a century backward. We had one thief, but now we have many. As a professional basketball player, nothing improved at all. Sometimes footballers have a chance to get a contract abroad if they do well in a match, but that is only for football. Basketball is now controlled by connections. Each basketball union chairman nominates people he knows to be the national team players. They didn't bring us foreign coaches like in football. When Jorvan Vieira was brought in to coach Iraqi footballers he chose players according to ability and they won the Asia cup. Our salaries increased after the war, but things are more expensive as well. Unless Iraqi politicians work for the unity of Iraq and people unite against the dangers, we have no hope at all. There is hatred among our people, and that is what the occupation wants. Of course I wish the occupation forces would leave right now, but they have to secure things before they do that. We need a strong ruler. I love Prime Minister [Nouri] Maliki, but we need a strong man. People did well under Iyad Allawi [the interim Prime Minister] because he was strict. The shop owner Aysar Ali, 30 A Sunni, Ali is married with two daughters. He owns a computer shop and lives in Mosul. I wish all of this never happened and Saddam was still in power. You have to be suspicious of everyone who you meet on the street. You have to also worry about random shooting. My family, and most if not all the families in Mosul, can no longer sleep on rooftops like we used to do on the hot summer nights. It gets worse when the electricity goes out. In my house, for example, the water tank on the roof was punctured three times with bullets. I don't like the American forces and wish they could leave my country, but definitely not yet. They caused a huge problem when they invaded, but they will cause a million more problems if they pull out now. It is their fault and they have to stay until it is corrected. They planted hatred among the people, and if they leave there will be many massacres. I am optimistic by nature, but now nothing calls for optimism. Things got worse financially since the invasion and I sell less. I used to stay out late but now I have to be home by sunset. Leisure is almost non-existent for me. I study business administration in the morning, look after my shop, then come home to have dinner with the family. That's it. Social calls have become out of the question. My parents live across town and I see them once every two weeks. I am worried about my two daughters growing up and not knowing who their relatives are. People in my neighbourhood have good relations, and ethnic and religious differences don't come to a head as long as the politicians keep their distance from us. The car trader Mahmood Thabit, 33 Thabit, a Sunni, is married, with two daughters. He used to be a farmer but the war forced him off the land. He lives in Kirkuk in the north. Before 2003 we only had to worry about not saying something against the government. Now we can say all we want, but life is in continuous threat. It is the same fear but with a different name. If the occupation forces leave now it will be a mistake, because it will be a jungle where the strong will crush the weak. With the power and ability the Americans have, I wish they would be more just and seek to help the interests of Iraqis rather than furthering their own interests only. Prices have multiplied since the war while earning money is more difficult. Life has become very expensive, even for basic things like cooking gas, kerosene for heaters or cooking and electricity. I used to work on a farm but now I don't because the water pump needs diesel to work and this is too expensive. Kirkuk has better security than other places and we can go around freely, so social relations are not affected by the security hazards as much. Curfew is at 11pm; if people need to see the doctor or go to hospital, police take them. The accountant Intisar Ibraheem, 48 Works as an accountant at a technical medicine institute. Her husband and three of her four sons are currently in Kurdistan for security reasons. She is a Sunni and lives in Baghdad. Once a van stopped at the street end, a few metres from my house, and dropped the bodies of six beheaded young men. And when I left our house for two months, squatters tried to take it over. My husband and I saved for years so that we can have this house, and now I have to stay and guard it. Our family has shrunk in the last five years. I lost two of my brothers, one of them killed by the militias and the other one in a car bomb. I wanted to keep my children away from the fear, the dead bodies and so on, so I sent them to the north provinces for safety. In our street there are only three families left from those who lived there before the war, they have all emigrated or fled. This has had a psychological, social and economic negative impact. I would say that we have been set back 50 years. One of the most important things for our lives is the electricity and for years now we have had almost none. Sewerage is also bad, despite my house being in what is considered a relatively high-class neighbourhood where everyone is educated and qualified. It is true that we have a relatively safer situation at the moment, but you never know when a dead body is going to turn up on the roadside or a random arrest is going to happen. That is what worries me most, because I fear for my son and there are many, many people behind bars for no legitimate reason at all. I spend my free time trying to read books to improve myself in my profession as an accountant and to make me forget all the miseries of my country. The garage manager Salah Al-Baghdadi, 35 Baghdadi, a Shia, is married with three children. He worked as an electronics engineer in Baghdad but fled the violence with his family a year ago and now runs a car radiator maintenance workshop. He lives in Diwaniya. Satellite TV channels, which we were not allowed to receive before the war, are popular, and we now use mobile phones and the internet, which have increased our freedom. But our lives have become worse because of the deterioration in security. We need to spend more money to live, but salaries don't match prices. Even social duties to relatives or attending weddings and funerals of friends have been severely limited. We totally lost hope in this country when all the Sunni-Shia violence took place in 2005, 2006 and early 2007. We never believed that things could ever improve in Iraq, or in Baghdad in particular. However, now we see a lot of changes and improvement, so we have some hope. Despite all the failures of the government, they have achieved something good in security, so maybe now they will focus on other problems like improving the living conditions, the infrastructure, water, electricity, technology. Most of my neighbours are Shia and relations are good. I have travelled abroad and seen Jordan, Syria and Iran, and I swear by God that the Iraqi people are better than all of them. In Iraq, people stand for each other and help each other out. Unemployed Thaer Hussein, 39 A Sunni, Hussein is married with two children and his wife is expecting their third child. A former soldier, he has worked intermittently as a security guard. He lives in Baghdad. The time before the war was better. I could go around feeling secure and confident, but now I don't. I could go all the way to Kirkuk to watch my football team. Now I would come back in a coffin. The thing that always bugs me is that I cannot freely take my family to al-Zawraa park in Baghdad. When we go we spend only an hour. Children have a simple right to see green grass, but they are deprived of even that. Work is rare. All the youths are jobless. There are no job opportunities, and if I want to apply for a public service job I also have to worry about which religious or political group is in control of that office. I wouldn't want the MNF (Multi-National Forces) to pull out soon. They are the last resort to keep the situation under control if others fail. Iraqis will not work correctly unless someone supervises them and keeps track of where the money is spent. The situation will improve if there is an ethnic-religious balance in the security forces. There should also be compulsory military service to keep youths busy. Relations in my neighbourhood, a mixed one, are all good. My neighbour is a Shia and we exchange food, especially on religious occasions. In my free time I sit with friends in the teahouse and talk about the past, since we cannot think about the future. The lawyer Hanaa Adwar, 62 Adwar, a lawyer, is secretary-general of the Al-Amal Association, a women's rights campaign. A Christian, she lives in Baghdad. The barriers between Iraq and the rest of the world have come down now. We can watch satellite TV, the internet, and travel. Before, we were living in terror, even inside our houses with our families. We couldn't express our thoughts. However, in the past two years these advances have somewhat receded because of the spread of terrorism, fear and violence. The displacement of families is now also a major problem. This has severely crushed the middle class, which already had big crises from previous times and we also have a huge joblessness problem: the ugly monster of the market economy has crushed people. Pensions for people who spent years serving this country are very low. Iraq's budget was more than $40bn for 2007 and for 2008, but where did all of this go? Where are the services it could have provided? Officials spend their budgets as they want, without any proper procedures. This is causing the whole political process to collapse. At a basic level our families shouldn't have to worry if relatives are late a bit from the usual time they show up at home. Our children need to laugh on their way to school knowing that they will have a good time there, not to get kidnapped on the way to school or get killed in an explosion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
