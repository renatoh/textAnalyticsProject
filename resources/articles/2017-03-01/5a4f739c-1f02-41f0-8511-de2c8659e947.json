As anyone who has gazed upon the aftermath of one can attest, these orgies of consumption typically leave in their wake a trail of plastic cups and dumped tents strewn about a wasteland of churned earth. And that\u2019s just the visible impact \u2013 there are also the carbon emissions of transporting stage infrastructure, performers, crew and of course fans to the festival site, not to mention the ravenous energy consumption of gigantic light and sound systems often powered by dirty diesel generators. In Australia festivals have been working to clean up their act, from Melbourne\u2019s Off the Grid capitalising on the solar power of the summer solstice, to the Byron Bay Surf festival banning plastic, to Victoria\u2019s Meredith music festival doing the impossible and creating good out of a festival toilet by using human waste for compost. One of the pacesetters for decades has been the Adelaide leg of Womad (World of Music and Dance), which at the weekend marked its 25th anniversary by inching closer to the realisation of the festival director Ian Scobie\u2019s dream party \u2013 one without the environmental hangover. Womadelaide has launched a medley of initiatives to mitigate the harm it inflicts, from incentivising patrons to arrive by bike, to converting food packaging waste into compost that helps to restore the festival\u2019s Botanic Park site, to donating $2 of each ticket sale to the planting of 70,000 native trees that have offset 16,250 tonnes of carbon emissions. Scobie jokes that the only way the event could reduce its environmental impact further would be to cancel it completely. Well? \u201cOK, I was being facetious,\u201d he says. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve had artists say they aren\u2019t going to fly and are just going to distribute music by streaming via the internet. It is a legitimate position to take. Our view though is there is much more positive that can come out of this festival providing a platform for discussion of the environment. Like any artistic enterprise, it draws people into the moment to think about a particular issue.\u201d The most obvious example of Scobie\u2019s thinking is in Womadelaide\u2019s the Planet Talks, which this year featured Sir Tim Smit discussing his co-creation of the Eden Project, as well as a panel discussing personal action that can be taken on climate change. In a concerning sign that perhaps the environmental message isn\u2019t cutting through, festival organisers also felt the need to invite Nasa scientist Carmel Johnston to speak about the possibility of colonising Mars to safeguard humanity from extinction on Earth. Beyond the talks, there are less overt behaviour-changing initiatives \u2013 Scobie thinks even the verdant emerald green setting of Botanic Park in itself makes people more eco-conscious. \u201cPeople care because it is a beautiful setting,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it is in a bitumen car park it is a difficult task to win people over to looking after the site, but it is not a tough sell here.\u201d Another behaviour-changing achievement he touts is from the early years of Womadelaide, when the festival introduced unfamiliar yellow-topped recycling bins that had yet to be rolled out by local councils on to Adelaide\u2019s suburban kerbsides. And today Womad is working to improve recycling bins \u2013 in 2015 Adelaide Green Clean was brought onboard to further reduce the amount of rubbish going to landfill. The company collaborated with a University of South Australia study that filmed bin users and studied their responses to various types of bin signage, applying the findings to bin design and layout. Just as people read from left to right, they consider where to dispose of waste in that order as well. Adelaide Green Clean determined which direction foot traffic was likely to go and placed organic bins on the left, recycling in the middle and general waste to the right to encourage that as a last resort. The company changed the wording on the bins \u2013 for instance \u201clandfill\u201d instead of \u201cgeneral waste\u201d \u2013 and covered them in brighter colours associated with particular types of rubbish. Womad already required that traders use compostable cutlery and plates, but Adelaide Green Clean investigated the entire supply chain of those operating at Womad to ensure all food packaging could be turned into compost. Its managing director, Jordan Walsh, says the high expectations of sustainability at Womadelaide enabled his company to push further than it ever had before, and it is now rolling out what it has learned at hundreds of other events. \u201cThere are over 700 bins on site and the logistics are crazy, so if you can do it here, you can do it anywhere in Adelaide,\u201d he says. For the 2016 festival, 98% of waste was diverted from landfill, and organisers are pushing for more. Adelaide Green Clean has extended its arrangement with Womadelaide to continue until 2021, and Walsh says he has a plan to get the festival even closer to zero landfill. \u201cThat 2% is mostly nappies, so next year we\u2019re looking at possibly giving out boxes of compostable nappies so they can avoid landfill,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false}}}
