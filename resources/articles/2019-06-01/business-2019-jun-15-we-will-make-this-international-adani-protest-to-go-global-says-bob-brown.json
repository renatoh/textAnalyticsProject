Queensland\u2019s environment department on Thursday signed off on the company\u2019s plan to manage groundwater on and around its Galilee Basin mine site, allowing it to begin work on its Carmichael coal mine. But this hasn\u2019t halted the \u201cStop Adani\u201d protests, with some 200 campaigners holding a vigil outside the Indian High Commission on Saturday. Labor\u2019s poor election showing in Queensland was blamed partly on Brown and his anti-Adani convoy, with locals viewing their protests in the region as the south telling the north what to do. \u201cThis is hogwash,\u201d said Brown before addressing his supporters. \u201cThe biggest person telling Queenslanders what to do here is Gautam Adani. He\u2019s pulling the strings from over in India on a stack of politicians and media.\u201d He said the election result and the go-ahead for mine construction would not spell the end of the anti-Adani protests. \u201cWe will make this international,\u201d the former senator pledged. The group was protesting outside the Indian High Commission because the high commissioner Ajay Gondane had called for the Adani mine to go ahead. \u201cNow if the Indian high commissioner here is dancing to the tune of Gautum Adani, if he wants to interfere in Australian domestic affairs, let me tell you high commissioner, we will interfere in your Indian domestic affairs,\u201d he said to cheers from his supporters. He said the Adani company has an appalling record of environmental destruction and corruption overseas, particularly in its home country of India and the forested areas inhabited by the Gond peoples. \u201cThis brute of a billionaire is riding right over the top of them,\u201d Brown said. The groundwater approval means Adani will now be able to begin preliminary work, such as land-clearing and road access development at its mine site. But it still requires other federal environmental approvals before it can begin extracting coal. Other aspects of the project, such as a royalties agreement, are also yet to be finalised.
