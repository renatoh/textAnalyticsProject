The video clip of the fan being summoned onstage by his hero, the rapper Dave, to perform Dave\u2019s track Thiago Silva with bar to bar perfection, spread like wildfire. It was soon trending on social media with the hashtag #AlexFromGlasto, ultimately leading a sleep-deprived Mann to appear on Good Morning Britain to awkwardly resurrect his bars for Piers Morgan, a modelling deal with retailer BooHoo and the release of his own track, What Ya Kno Bout That Bro? \u201cI can hardly remember any of it now, there was so much adrenaline going through me when I was on stage,\u201d Mann says from his home in Somerset. \u201cDave is one of my top three rappers and as soon as he said he wanted someone from the crowd to come up and rap AJ Tracey\u2019s verse, I got straight on my friend\u2019s shoulders and was shouting for his attention.\u201d It just so happened that Mann was wearing a Thiago Silva football shirt and was spotted. \u201cAll I remember is Dave asking if I knew the words and then telling me to go for it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reaction from the crowd at the end was one of the best feelings I\u2019ve ever had in my life, but then the security guard took me straight back down and I didn\u2019t think much more of it.\u201d Of course, it was the kind of impromptu, heartwarming moment internet virality was made for and almost immediately the BBC clip was being shared thousands of times. \u201cI knew something was going on since everyone at the festival started recognising me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd then I got home and absolutely everyone knew about it, it was all anyone was talking about.\u201d Although they didn\u2019t get a chance to speak after the show, Dave reached out to Mann on Twitter after the weekend to offer him advice with his newfound fame. \u201cHe was really supportive,\u201d Mann says. \u201cHe just told me to try and not be taken advantage of and to enjoy it while it lasts, too.\u201d Yet Mann says that, six months on from his performance, the pressure of recognition has at times been overwhelming. \u201cI get recognised in the street all the time and it makes it hard to just go about my normal life \u2013 when I started college in September everyone knew who I was,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to only be remembered as Alex from Glasto \u2013 I know I\u2019m lucky to have this platform but I want to do something important with it. I\u2019m just not sure what yet.\u201d With online recognition inevitably comes online abuse also. \u201cI try to ignore the negative comments,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople will take any chance to get at you, but there also isn\u2019t really anyone you can ask for advice in these situations because it all happens so fast. You end up having to go it alone.\u201d As for his own music career. \u201cI was just testing the waters there with that single,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a great opportunity, but I need to take some time out now and get on with my life like any other 16-year-old.\u201d Plus, he didn\u2019t manage to get a ticket for Glastonbury next year. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go for the resale,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be staying away from the cameras this time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
