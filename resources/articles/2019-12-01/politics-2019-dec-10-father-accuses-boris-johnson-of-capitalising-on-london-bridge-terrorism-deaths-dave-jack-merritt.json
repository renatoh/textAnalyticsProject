As Boris Johnson sought on Tuesday to get his general election campaign back on track, Dave Merritt accused him of seeking to capitalise on his son\u2019s murder. In an interview with Sky News, Merritt said: \u201cWhat was required was just a dignified approach, whereby the politicians would express their regrets, express their condolences to the people affected and would then get on with campaigning in the election \u2013 it wasn\u2019t an election issue. \u201cInstead of seeing a tragedy, Boris Johnson saw an opportunity, and he went on the offensive and started talking about extending the tariff for prisoners serving sentences with a maximum of 25 years.\u201d In the immediate aftermath of the attack, in which Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were killed, the prime minister wrote an article in the Mail on Sunday calling for changes to sentencing laws. \u201cSend me back to No 10 and I will end automatic early release of violent offenders and terrorists,\u201d it was headlined. The attack prompted a robust debate about sentencing policy, but Merritt described Johnson\u2019s response as a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d and \u201can ill-considered intervention\u201d. Johnson wrote in his article: \u201cAs prime minister, I will always back our security services, our police and our troops. I will give them the funding they need and I will boost their numbers. I will support them when they make difficult decisions in dangerous situations. \u201cI will ensure that they do not come under constant attack from the human rights lobby who would weaken our anti-terror laws. But these changes can only be achieved with a Conservative majority government.\u201d Merritt said he had not been contacted by the prime minister or 10 Downing Street since his son\u2019s murder. He said police officers had passed on a message that the home secretary, Priti Patel, wanted to meet to \u201cexpress her condolences\u201d, but the family declined. Jack Merritt, a course coordinator for Learning Together, a programme run by Cambridge University\u2019s Institute of Criminology, had been at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall in London Bridge on 29 November when Usman Khan launched the knife attack. Khan, who was shot dead by police, had been arrested in December 2010 and released on licence in December 2018, wearing an electronic tag. The Conservatives were criticised on Monday after Johnson pocketed the mobile phone of an ITV reporter who was urging him to look at a photo of a four-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor. Johnson\u2019s party later had to retract claims that an aide to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was hit when he visited the hospital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
