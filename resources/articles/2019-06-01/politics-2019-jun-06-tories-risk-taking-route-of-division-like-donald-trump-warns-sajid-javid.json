While Javid did not mention Johnson by name on Thursday, he separately condemned the former foreign secretary for referring to Muslim women as \u201cletterboxes\u201d, saying this was not the sort of language a \u201cserious politician\u201d should use. Speaking at an event organised by the integration-focused thinktank British Future, the home secretary responded to a discussion about the US president\u2019s state visit by noting the increased prevalence across some nations of politicians \u201cdeciding that one way to get votes is to appeal to division, to get people angry\u201d. Javid said: \u201cI do think there\u2019s a decision we face as Conservatives: what kind of party do we want to be? Do we want to be a party that appeals broadly, to the whole country, a one-nation party that tries to bring people together, or do we want to go down the route of division? For me it has to be the former.\u201d In a subsequent question-and-answer session, Javid confirmed that this warning referred to some fellow contenders to replace Theresa May. He said: \u201cYes, my party\u2019s at that crossroads. There are candidates that I believe, the way that they would try and win a future general election is by exploiting division. And that\u2019s something I utterly reject.\u201d He did not mention any names, but the comments appeared to be directed at Johnson, the frontrunner, as well as the likes of former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and ex-work and pensions secretary Esther McVey. Asked later about Johnson\u2019s comments that Muslim women in full-face niqab outfits looked like \u201cletterboxes\u201d or \u201cbank robbers\u201d, Javid said: \u201cI think they\u2019re wrong. I don\u2019t think those are the right comments. I don\u2019t think any serious politician should use language like that.\u201d In response to a question about Raab\u2019s mooted plan to prevent MPs from blocking a no-deal Brexit by proroguing parliament, Javid called this \u201ca complete nonsense\u201d. Javid said he would do \u201ceverything I can\u201d to leave the EU on 31 October, and would opt for no deal over no Brexit. He said: \u201cWhatever I do, parliament is going to want to have its say on it, and parliament should have its say. The idea that anyone would think they can block parliament \u2013 our parliament is sovereign. \u201cI\u2019m not into this proroguing parliament rubbish. It\u2019s just a complete nonsense, and anti-democratic and anti-British.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
