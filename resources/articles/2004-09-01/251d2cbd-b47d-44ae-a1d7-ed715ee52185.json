He is currently working on a novella, Bubble Wrapping Artificial Shit, and a blues album, Jacaranda Skits. More about the Caine prize \"This is a m\u00e9lange of geniuses whose minds sought to tackle or reorder the worlds they lived in. These writers had issues to settle with society, and in these works of fiction they let rip their imaginations to drip smoldering ideas on the minds of their generations and many beyond.\" 1. A Hero Of Our Time by Mikhail Lermontov A landmark in Russian literature, this novel published in 1840 influenced writers such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy. Five episodes, each of which could easily stand alone as a short story, are weaved together to produce a psychologically fascinating story of 19th century aristocratic boredom and disillusionment. 2. The House of Hunger by Dambudzo Marechera A wildly angry and chaotic novella (and other stories) by the tortured late Zimbabwean author. Marechera has also been described as African literature's enfant terrible largely for his rejection of African literature as ridiculously narrow. 3. Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky Dostoevsky is one of the greatest literary talents the world has seen in the past two centuries, and the reputation of his works is monumental. Notes From Underground is arguably his most idiosyncratic masterpiece. 4. Collected Stories by Isaac Babel A collection of stories by the hard-hitting Jewish Russian author. \"...since I was a boy, I have felt that certain literary works were a form of witchcraft. After I had read The King, I knew that a new sorcerer had entered Russian literature,\" Russian writer Konstantin Paustovsky once referred to Babel. 5. Tigers are Better-Looking by Jean Rhys A very engaging collection of passionately delivered short stories, incorporating Rhys's first collection of Paris stories, The Left Bank. Rhys's work was way beyond her time in terms of the issues she tackled. 6. Nausea by Jean-Paul Sartre Sartre's thought-provoking novel in which he explores his theories of existential angst through a protagonist whose encounters with existence lead him to a relentless questioning of reality. 7. The Outsider by Albert Camus One of the 20th century's existential jewels. It is a short unassuming novel through which the Algerian-French writer/philosopher delivers an awesome indictment of society. 8. The Complete Short Stories of Franz Kafka For anyone interested in the development of Kafka's ideas into longer fiction, this is the definitive book. In this collection one sees Kafka's imagination toying around with the worlds that it creates. 9. Against Nature by Joris-Karl Huysmans A very dense and compact story in which Huysmans extended the scope of the French novel by using art, science and history to frame and capture the excessive indulgence of an aristocratic heir. 10. Catcher In the Rye by JD Salinger A literary masterpiece by a master of satire, this is a devastating examination of the human condition and has kept its controversial reputation since its publication in 1951."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
