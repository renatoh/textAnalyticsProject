Thanks a lot for following and I will be back tomorrow for the second batch of R32 matches. Here is Kevin Mitchell again on Serena Williams\u2019s comeback win over Sloane Stephens. Until tomorrow. Final stats for Frances Tiafoe: 83% points won on his first serve, 53% points won on second serve. 22 winners, 21 unforced errors, 51% return games won. With a new coach and a clean slate after the tour suspension, perhaps we\u2019re seeing the making of Tiafoe. He arrived at this tournament ranked 82 after a tough 52 weeks. This is a lot closer to where he should be. A comprehensive victory from Frances Tiafoe to reach his first ever US Open fourth round. He will face third seed Daniil Medvedev next. Ever. Marton Fucsovics drags one of the breaks back from Frances Tiafoe after a couple of wild forehands from the American. This is the biggest match of Tiafoe\u2019s career on home soil and we will see if it comes with added nerves. Tiafoe leads 6-2 6-3 4-2*. Felix Auger-Aliassime is through to his first career slam fourth round with another dominant performance. After eviscerating Andy Murray a few days ago, this time he batters Dan Evans\u2019 conqueror Corentin Moutet 6-1 6-0 6-4. He will face the winner of Dominic Thiem vs Marin Cilic. Marton Fucsovics just pulled off an incredible around the post shot so good that Frances Tiafoe screamed in shock. Sadly for Fucsovics, he is too miserable to celebrate just one good shot. He now trails Tiafoe 6-2 6-3 *4-1 with a double break in the third. It would take a heck of a lot for a comeback now. On Armstrong, Frances Tiafoe breaks to love to lead 6-2 6-3 *2-1 on Marton Fucsovics. He sealed the break in style with a booming backhand down-the-line return winner, punctuated with a gleeful roar. In his press conference, Daniil Medvedev was reminisced on some old nostalgic memories with Andrey Rublev, who he may face in the quarters: Q. You sort of mentioned on court how happy you were to get through in straight sets, as you have throughout the tournament. Andrey also has done the same. I\u2019m curious, I remember seeing the pictures of you with him from years ago with you in the juniors. What are some of your memories with Andrey? DANIIL MEDVEDEV: First memories is easy. I think we played a match when we were like maybe 12 years old, both of us, or 11, and we were one of the worst juniors in terms of attitude that you could see. We were crying, throwing the racquets over the fans. We were young, of course, so we hated to lose. I was doing only lobs at the time, only lobs. Him, I don\u2019t think he was hitting the ball as hard as right now. It was crazy matches. That\u2019s the first memory I have. But, yeah, I remember we lost in US Open Juniors. I don\u2019t remember if it was the same day or not, and we just went to see Times Square, Manhattan, because before we didn\u2019t have time. And we had a great time. Also there was Jelena Ostapenko there. Nice memories. All of us on the top level now. I\u2019m just wondering when you have been in the sport as long as you have, like you said yourself, every day you go out on the court you seem to be chasing some record or another. I\u2019m wondering, how do you compartmentalize all that when that\u2019s happening on a day-to-day basis and you\u2019re sort of carrying that weight with you? SERENA WILLIAMS: Sometimes it\u2019s harder than others. Every day having \u2018Serena\u2019 on your back is a massive target for the tour, for press, for stress. But as Billie Jean King said, pressure is a privilege. So I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. So I just try to think about how fortunate I am to have been in this position, and honestly, to be Serena. It feels weird to say that (smiling). Felix Auger-Aliassime is still cruising. He now leads 6-1 6-0 *3-2 on poor Corentin Moutet. Frances Tiafoe moves to a 6-2 6-3 lead over Marton Fucsovics on Louis Armstrong Stadium. So far this has been one of Tiafoe\u2019s best career performances in a big match. 62% first serves in, 90% points won on first serve, 43% return points won, 16 winners, 8 unforced errors. This is clinical. This is just too good from Frances Tiafoe, who moves to a 6-2 5-2* lead against Marton Fucsovics on Armstrong. On the final point of Tiafoe\u2019s last hold, Fucsovics flitted to the net after a return and unsuccessfully tried to rush Tiafoe. At the moment, he already looks out of ideas. The story of the tournament continues as Tsvetana Pironkova eases past 18th seed Donna Vekic 6-4 6-1 in just 64 minutes. As I noted earlier, this is just an astonishing feat. When Pironkova\u2019s name showed up in the entry list after not playing for three years, some people thought she was understandably returning at a big event for the quick $60k payday and that a first round loss would follow. Instead, she has returned after a 3 year absence and her first child immediately playing some of her best tennis. Here is Kevin Mitchell on Serena Williams\u2019s escape. An deomlition job is unfolding right now. Felix Auger-Aliassime is now up 6-1 6-0 on Corentin Moutet, conqueror of Dan Evans yesterday. Moutet hit 1(!) winner and 9 errors in the second set. Auger-Aliassime won the final break after hitting a tweener on break point. We have been reminded all week that no match is over until the final ball, but Moutet is playing for his pride right now. Frances Tiafoe is playing a really disciplined match on Armstrong so far. He is up 6-2 on Marton Fucsovics with 9 winners and just 4 unforced errors. Tsvetana Pironkova takes the first set 6-4 on Donna Vekic. Here she is talking about her comeback and motherhood. Q. When you were preparing to come back, in the three years that you were away, how much were you paying attention to the tour? How much were you paying attention to how tennis had changed from when you finished? Did that inform how you felt you needed to prepare as you came back? TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: Well, I always followed the news around the tour obviously, especially the Grand Slams. I always watched those. But I really took some time off away from tennis in all aspects. There were times where I didn\u2019t really follow all the tournaments, just a few ones. That was kind of I guess I just needed to distance myself a little bit for about two years. Little by little I started really missing the tour, started watching more tournaments, started to follow the players. I kind of started to make plans in my head looking at the calendar, which tournament would suit me best (smiling). Yeah, at one point I was like, Okay, let\u2019s take this opportunity, let\u2019s take this chance, just try to do my best. The result right now, as I said in the previous question, it really makes me proud and happy. Q. There are several mothers playing at the US Open this week. Could you explain the challenges and joys of raising a young child while also competing at the highest level in tennis? TSVETANA PIRONKOVA: It\u2019s definitely not easy. I mean, it\u2019s just my first tournament back. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of challenges, but they are priorities in the first place. That would always be my son and my family and their health and happiness. I would never make a compromise with that. But, you know, if you make a good schedule, if you really have the right motivation, I guess you can combine the two things, motherhood and being a professional tennis player. It makes a lot of work, but everything takes work, so... This is nice. Around the grounds: Frances Tiafoe, who is vying for his first US Open fourth round, begins on Louis Armstrong against Marton Fucsovics. The score is 1-1. 18th seed Donna Vekic is down *4-3 to Tsvetana Pironkova. Pironkova is the on-court story of the tournament so far: a former Wimbledon semi-finalist who is known as an upset specialist. She took three years off and gave birth to her son and this is her first tournament back. She has already upset Garbine Muguruza and she is now going after a second top 20 seed. Felix Auger Aliassime is up 6-1 on Corentin Moutet. Serena had some interesting tactics today: \u201cIn that first set, I don\u2019t think she made any errors, honestly. She was playing so clean and I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t wanna lost in straight sets [laughter].\u2019 \u2018Cos I was like, \u2018She playing so good, oh my god.\u2019 I was like, \u2018OK Serena, just get a game, get a game.\u2019\u201d Serena: \u201cWe always have incredible matches. It brings out the best in my fitness when I play Sloane. She\u2019s obviously a great player, she\u2019s won on this court. She\u2019s had every good win you can think of.\u201d Sloane Stephens played an excellent first set, but she could not keep her intensity up. An impressive recovery from Williams, who had to grind hard through the middle of the second set but she was hitting freely by the end. Maria Sakkari next. Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 5-2* Sloane Stephens. So far, Stephens hasn\u2019t indicated that she has much else to give. Serena curls a slick ace out wide and she is one game from the second week. After outplaying Cincinnati finalist Milos Raonic in the previous round, Vasek Pospisil produces one of the best career performances to take out the 8th seed. Incredible effort. On Ashe, Serena Williams leads 2-6 6-2 *4-2. Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 4-1* Sloane Stephens. From 0-30 down, Williams comes up three big serves to scupper the danger. Clutch. On game point, a backhand error from Stephens allows the elder American to consolidate. Stephens is still searching for her first set intensity and it nowhere to be seen so far. Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 *3-1 Sloane Stephens. Williams breaks. A sloppy series of errors from Stephens sent her down 0-40. Williams then missed two returns in a row, before Stephens teed off on an excellent down the line forehand winner. At deuce, the younger American sprayed another forehand wide. However, on her fourth break point Williams produced a brilliant series of meaty forehands to break. What does Stephens have left? A great recovery from the Aussie after losing 8 games in a row in the middle of the match. He reaches his first ever US Open fourth round. He will face Roberto Bautista Agut or Vasek Pospisil. The Canadian currently leads *3-2 in the fifth. Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 2-1* Sloane Stephens. Serena Williams moves up again in the third set, holding with a huge serve down the T. She also struck a nice crosscourt forehand winner in that game and looks tidier off the ground so far in this set. We shall see if that lasts. Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 *1-1 Sloane Stephens. Two unremarkable holds to kick off the third set. An essential start for Stephens, who broke a run of 5 consecutive games for Williams. Around the grounds: Vasek Pospisil has fought back against Roberto Bautista Agut and leads *2-1 in the fifth set. Alex de Minaur has also battled back well and he is currently up 5-1* in the fifth on Karen Khachanov, the finish line in sight. Last year\u2019s semi-finalist Matteo Berrettini eased into the fourth round 6-4 6-4 6-2 over Casper Ruud. A big match against Andrey Rublev awaits. Kudos to Serena for finding her serve in the first set - she landed an enormous 76% of first serves there. She was also just patient in the longer rallies at 3-2* when it really mattered. As good as Stephens is and as well as she has played today, it has been so long since she has even played like a top 100 player. It isn\u2019t particularly surprising that she couldn\u2019t maintain her level. We\u2019ll see whether she can find her way again in the third. That went quickly. With a brilliant running crosscourt forehand winner, Serena Williams levels the match at one set all. Too many errors from Stephens in the final couple of games. Serena Williams 2-6 5-2* Sloane Stephens. Momentum has shifted as Williams rolls few an easy hold to consolidate the break. She is finding her first serve while errors are starting to pepper Stephens\u2019s game. Serena Williams 2-6 *4-2 Sloane Stephens. It has taken a heck of a lot of perseverance, but Serena Williams takes her first break of the match. Stephens netted a forehand at 30-30, then erased it with a stunning inside out forehand winner. But at deuce, Williams dug in and survived a 16 shot rally to break. At that point, Williams had won only 7 of 28 rallies over 5 shots, but that was one of the most important ones. A forehand error from Stephens handed over the break. Serena Williams 2-6 3-2* Sloane Stephens. A big moment there as Williams survives break point to hold again. From game point at 40-30, Williams missed another first serve and was dragged into a 14 stroke rally. By the end of it, she had hit a rare slice forehand, she was panting and she eventually shanked a forehand out. Williams then double faulted at deuce, but she dug herself out of the hole with two big serves. Serena Williams 2-6 *2-2 Sloane Stephens. 3 errors in a row from Williams and Stephens rolls through another hold. Williams\u2019s biggest problem right now is her timing on her groundstrokes. When she tries to step in and take control of points, as she did there, she is making a ton of errors. When she tries to take a step back, put the ball in court and find some rhythm, Stephens is all over her. Serena Williams 2-6 2-1* Sloane Stephens. Back on Ashe, Serena Williams has found some rhythm on serve and she sealed her second hold of the set with an ace. Around the grounds: Roberto Bautista Agut leads Vasek Pospisil 5-7 6-2 6-4 3-3 Alex de Minaur has pushed Karen Khachanov to a fifth set, 6-4 0-6 4-6 6-3. Matteo Berrettini leads Casper Ruud 6-4 6-4 *2-1 Elise Mertens eased past Caty McNally 7-5 6-1 Karolina Muchova overcame Sorana Cirstea in an extremely dramatic 6-3 2-6 7-6(7) win. That was just an excellent set of tennis from Sloane Stephens. 79% first serves in, 11 winners, 5 unforced errors, 50% of return points won. Stephens is moving so well and hitting freely off the ground. Williams just hasn\u2019t been able to keep up in the rallies. Her timing is off on both groundstrokes and Stephens is using width on her strokes to expose her movement, which has not been great either. She has to start by serving much better in the second set. Stephens serves out an excellent set of tennis to love, sealed with an unreturned serve. Serena Williams has a lot to think about. Serena Williams 2-5* Sloane Stephens. Williams is working hard and breathing harder, but she is just a step behind Stephens every time they fall into a neutral rally. From 30-30, there were two longer rallies and both times Williams eventually gave up an unforced error. It is hard to overstate how good Stephens has looked so far. She is locked in. Serena Williams *2-4 Sloane Stephens. This time, Stephens saves double break point to push ahead. Serena looked a lot more alert, but she met a barrage of winners in response. Stephens opened with a glorious running forehand down the line passing shot. Then, from 15-40 down, Stephens produced three brutal forehand winners in a row, dragging Williams around the court at will. After a missed backhand return from Williams, the younger American held. Serena Williams 2-3* Sloane Stephens. Williams saves double break point to hold serve, but none of this is easy. She saved the first break point with an excellent unreturned kick second serve, then the second with her fourth ace. But off the ground, Williams continues to be sluggish and she is not moving well. What she is doing is working hard. At deuce she found a nice backhand down-the-line before landing a final unreturned first serve to hold. Serena Williams *1-3 Sloane Stephens. Stephens consolidates the break, and with some style. After a fortunate net cord at 30-30, Stephens produced a beautiful curling angled forehand winner to hold. Meanwhile, Kristina Mladenovic, top seed in women\u2019s doubles alongside Timea Babos, has been withdrawn from the US Open after Public health officials of Nassau County stepped in. What a tournament this has been. Serena Williams 1-2* Sloane Stephens. Early on, Stephens looks so smooth off the ground and she is actually winning the majority of points from the baseline, easily moving the elder American around. From deuce, Williams missed a couple of first serves and then threw in a couple of unforced errors. Stephens takes the first break. Serena Williams *1-1 Sloane Stephens. A great start for Stephens on her serve. Williams was prowling with some big second serve returns, but Stephens navigated the game well. She fired consecutive forehand and backhand winners from 15-15 and then dismounted with an unreturned serve down the T. Serena Williams 1-0* Sloane Stephens: It didn\u2019t take long for Stephens to show what she can do, pushing Williams to deuce with a vicious crosscourt forehand winner. But Williams found a big serve at wide from deuce, then a solid unreturned second serve to hold. Serena Williams leads the head-to-head 5-1, with Stephens\u2019 one big win coming in the quarters of the 2013 Australian Open. Their relationship wasn\u2019t always the best back in 2013, but that was a long time ago and it\u2019s all business now. Both players are out on court and Serena will begin. As for Serena, this has been an unideal return to action. After falling in the quarters of the Top Seed Open in Lexington, last week she fell to Maria Sakkari under the strangest circumstances. After failing to serve out the match, she ended it cramping and not always trying her hardest as she lost 6-1 in the third set. There are question marks over Serena\u2019s nerves after losing so many tight matches in 2020 and also over her consistent level of play. We will learn a few things today. This is a huge match, of course, between two slam champions who have a history, but it comes at a strange period. At her best, Stephens is one of the most talented players in the world. She is one of the fastest female players, her forehand is enormous, she has great hand skills. She flips defence to offence like few others and not many players are capable of both soaking up Serena\u2019s pace and matching it off the ground. But Stephens has been knee deep in a slump, having lost 9 of her previous matches coming into the US Open. 5 of those losses were to players outside of the top 100. She has played well so far in New York, easing into the third round without dropping a set. We\u2019ll see what level she can produce on the biggest stagee. It is now time for the match of the day. 6 time US Open champion Serena Williams will soon be out on Arthur Ashe to face 2017 champion Sloane Stephens. Firstly, here is what they said about each other: Q. Your next opponent, Sloane Stephens, could you assess her as an opponent. SERENA WILLIAMS: Well, she\u2019s a great competitor. It\u2019s an incredibly interesting match, because she\u2019s actually a US Open champion. She\u2019s a great player. You can\u2019t win a Grand Slam and not be really, really, really, really, really good. Wow, it\u2019s a lot. I have a lot of things that I need to go home and focus on and do to get ready for that. Q. Wondering about your approach when you\u2019re playing someone like Sloane who you have had a number of matches against and haven\u2019t faced in a while. Do you go back and see how she\u2019s evolved since you last saw her? Does your preparation change? SERENA WILLIAMS: I\u2019ve just got to get ready for the match. It doesn\u2019t really change. Always going to be intense. Always going to be, you know, who I am on the court, so that\u2019s the only thing I can do. And the only difference is I\u2019m playing such a good player so early, so I have to bring, you know, what I can even more. Around the grounds: 8th seed Roberto Bautista Agut levels Vasek Pospisil at 5-7 6-2 11th seed Karen Khachanov has now won 8 games in a row and leads 21st seed Alex de Minaur 4-6 6-0 2-0*. Sorana Cirstea, conqueror of Jo Konta, is up 3-6 6-2 *2-1 against 20th seed Karolina Muchova. 6th seed Matteo Berrettini is up 6-3 on Casper Ruud. 16th seed Elise Mertens leads Caty McNally 7-5. Daniil Medvedev will play against Frances Tiafoe or Marton Fucsovics in round four. A good performance by the Russian sealed with a slick serve and volley on match point. Medvedev\u2019s stats: 32 winners, 10 unforced errors. 79% first serve points won. 52% return points won. 97 points won to 68. A clean kill. On Ashe, Daniil Medvedev is serving for the match against JJ Wolf. The third seed leads 6-3 6-3 *5-2. Karen Khachanov indeed just handed a bagel Alex de Minaur. Although the Aussie created a break point in the final game, that was surely one of the least focused sets of tennis has has played since he reached the top of the game. A lot to think about. de Minaur 6-4 0-6 Khachanov. Karen Khachanov now leads de Minaur *5-0 in the second set and will serve for a bagel. Khachanov has been solid, he is completely demolishing the de Minaur second serve and has won 2/13 points against it in this set. That last game also included some great defence from Khachanov, who at deuce chased down every last ball and then threw up a great defensive lob from a de Minaur overhead. de Minaur 6-4 0-5* Khachanov. Daniil Medvedev continues to roll on Arthur Ashe. Medvedev now leads JJ Wolf 6-3 6-3 *3-1 Alex de Minaur has not started the second set well against Karen Khachanov. The Aussie double faulted on break point to hand away the opening break of set two. Khachanov took heart from that early break and he is imposing his game far more in this set. He secured a double break with a huge inside out forehand, followed by a brutal down-the-line backhand return winner. de Minaur leads Khachanov 6-3 0-3*. Daniil Medvedev\u2019s stats after two sets: 24 winners, 7 unforced errors, 48% of return points won. Not bad at all. Daniil Medvedev played with his food a little by dropping serve at *5-1 in the second set, but he had no problems at the second attempt. The Russian served out the second set to 15 with an ace down the T. Daniil Medvedev leafs JJ Wolf 6-3 6-3. Oh dear. After all of that good work to break back, Karen Khachanov threw in a horror of a service game to hand over the set with a slew of errors. Khachanov has now hit 9 winners and 21 errors, which obviously isn\u2019t nearly good enough. Alex de Minaur leads Karen Khachanov 6-4. Alex de Minaur was strolling along well, dominating on serve and on the verge of taking the first set as he moved up 5-3 40-30. Then he hit three errors and gave the break back. Good work from Karen Khachanov though, who put his returns in play and pushed de Minaur around the court with his backhand without taking any unnecessary risks. de Minaur leads Khachanov 5-4*. Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski will face Mate Pavic and Bruno Soares in the men\u2019s doubles quarterfinals. The Croatia-Brazil team just recovered from a set and a break down to beat Jack Sock and Jackson Withrow 5-7 7-6(5) 6-4. An upset is perhaps brewing on Louis Armstrong Stadium. After fending off break point at 5-5, Vasek Pospisil crushes an inside out forehand winner to take the first set 7-5 against 8th seed Roberto Bautista Agut with a break to love. Pospisil has won 81% of first serve points so far with 19 winners to 13 errors. Daniil Medvedev continues to distance himself from JJ Wolf, breaking serve and then consolidating to lead 6-3 4-1*. Wolf has played well, but he got a little sloppy towards the end of his service game at 2-1, dumping a backhand into the net at 30-30 then netting a forehand after a long rally at 30-40. Wolf did well to push Medvedev to deuce, but then he swiped two more errors well long. The third seed is on his way. Around the grounds: Over on court 5, 21st seed Alex de Minaur has started really well against 11th seed Karen Khachanov and leads 4-1*. 8th seed Roberto Bautista Agut is locked in a tight first set with Vasek Pospisil at 5-5. 20th seed Karolina Muchova is up *4-3 on Sorana Cirstea, conqueror of Jo Konta. We should talk a little more about Daniil Medvedev. Two years ago he was ranked 68th and considered one of the least talented young players in the top 100, when people even considered him at all. His rise has been perhaps the story of the last 18 months on the ATP, which began on the US hardcourts last year and culminated with a run to last year\u2019s US Open final. When you see a 6\u20196 giant like Medvedev, the natural expectation is enormous power and aggression but Medvedev is instead such a unique player. His technique alone is unorthodox, particularly his forehand which seems to wrap around his neck during the follow-through. Although he does possess a big first serve, he is actually fast, consistent, he can grind any opponent down for days and he reads the game so well. He is one of the only players I have ever seen step up to Novak Djokovic and attempt to physically break him. Look for how Medvedev can flip a rally on its head by injecting pace at the perfect moment and also the quality of his groundstrokes on the run, at the end of his range. He is growing into one of the best players in the world and he is rightfully one of the favourites after Novak Djokovic. Daniil Medvedev leads JJ Wolf 6-3 2-1*. Let\u2019s just take a moment to recognise Alex de Minaur\u2019s ridiculous moustache, which he intermittently grows for reasons that nobody is quite sure of. Still, it is good to see him back after he was unable to compete at the Australian Open this year. Today\u2019s COVID-19 drama? Kristina Mladenovic, one of the famed Paire 11, was due to compete in doubles today but her match has been removed from the schedule. Mladenovic and Timea Babos are the top seeds in doubles so it would be a huge deal if she is unable to play. Over on court 5, another interesting 3rd round match has begun: 11th seed Karen Khachanov vs 21st seed Alex de Minaur. A first US Open fourth round appearance awaits for the winner. A businesslike set of tennis from Daniil Medvedev, who moves ahead 6-3 on JJ Wolf. 10 winners, 2 unforced errors and 82% points won on his first serve, sealed with a slick foray to the net. JJ Wolf finally got into a Daniil Medvedev service game. He pushed the fourth seed to deuce and then was all over him throughout the point. Desperately chasing down the ball from miles behind the baseline, Medvedev responded with an incredible last ditch backhand passing shot at deuce to bring up game point. At advantage, he dragged Wolf off the court with a nice crosscourt forehand to hold. Medvedev leads Wolf 5-3*. Daniil Medvedev has only lost 2 points on his serve so far today and he has paired his 8 winners with 0 unforced errors. Medvedev now leads JJ Wolf *4-3. Andrey Rublev has completed his annihilation of Salvatore Caruso on court 5, demolishing the Italian 6-0 6-4 6-0 in 83 minutes. Keep an eye out for Rublev, who has one of the biggest forehands in the game and has been rising steadily over the past year since returning from a couple of injuries. He faces 6th seed Matteo Berrettini or Casper Ruud in the next round and he could beat either player. Daniil Medvedev has been playing really well since the restart and he is already in the ascendancy on Ashe, breaking to 30 in the 5th game. At 30-30, the Russian was pushed far behind the baseline when he chased down a forehand and crushed a crosscourt winner behind it. At 30-40, Wolf then netted a forehand to hand over the opening break. Medvedev leads Wolf *3-2. On Arthur Ashe Stadium, 3rd seed Daniil Medvedev has just started against American JJ Wolf. Wolf, whose full names are Jeffrey John, is a 21-year old from Ohio. Ranked 138, he has been making a name for himself on the ATP Challenger tour and this is his breakout tournament at the top level. Wolf\u2019s strengths include a huge forehand and an old school mullet. Wolf leads 2-1*. Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski will play the winner of Sock/Withrow versus Pavic/Soares. Sock and Withrow currently lead 7-5 *4-3. A clinical performance from Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski, who roll into the quarterfinals of the men\u2019s doubles with a 6-3 6-2 win over Marcelo Demoliner and Matwe Middelkoop. After reaching the final last week in the Western &amp; Southern Open, the Brits are clearly in great form. On court 5, Andrey Rublev is now up 6-0 6-4 against Salvatore Caruso and well on his way to the fourth round. The fast improving Maria Sakkari eases into her first career US Open R16. A performance to forget from Amanda Anisimova, but Sakkari looks great. She will have to be even better: she plays the winner of Serena Williams vs Sloane Stephens. Maria Sakkari leads 6-3 5-1 on Amanda Anisimova and will serve for her second consecutive slam R16. Anisimova has now hit 17 forehand unforced errors, including three in the last game. Just not good enough, really. There may be no more British players left in the draw, but it should be noted that Maria Sakkari is being coached by 25 year-old British coach Tom Hill. Check out my piece on Hill and Andy Bettles, another young Brit who coaches Elina Svitolina, from June. Maria Sakkari moves to a 6-3 4-1* lead on Amanda Anisimova. Under some pressure at 30-30, Sakkari was dragged out wide on her backhand and responded with a gorgeous crosscourt backhand, flipping defence to offence before closing off with a slick forehand. With a further unreturned serve, she moves ahead. This has not been much of a test for Maria Sakkari so far. After the pair traded breaks to open set two, the Greek has now established a 6-3 *3-1 lead on Amanda Anisimova. The young American\u2019s forehand is all over the place and her stats currently read: 4 winners, 23 errors. That is awful. Over on court 11, Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski are rolling. They lead 6-3 *1-0 against Marcelo Demoliner and Matwe Middelkoop. One thing people may have missed last night was Borna Coric\u2019s incredible comeback against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Coric recovered from 6-7 6-4 4-6 1-5 down against the fourth seed, including triple match point at 4-5* in the fourth set. He then recovered a further break in the fifth set before winning on a tiebreak in the final set. Coric was once billed as the next big thing and after finally breaking through in 2018, he has struggled with a constant stream of injuries while being caught up by more talented peers. A great day for him but a horror for Tsitsipas, whose coaching relationship with his father continues to be a huge source of anxiety during matches. At one point, Papa Tsitsipas was pacing back and forth at the top of the stadium. It\u2019s hard to imagine that was comforting sight for Stefanos, whose frequent yells towards his father echoed in the empty stadium. Over on court 5, 10th seed Andrey Rublev is in a hurry. He is now up 6-0 *1-1 on Salvatore Caruso. Maria Sakkari takes the first set 6-3 against Amanda Anisimova on Armstrong. That set really got away from Anisimova at the end, who handed over her final service game to love with a flurry of unforced errors that included a forehand that flew well wide and then a limp crosscourt backhand into the bottom of the net. She has to fight harder than that or this will be a very quick day. Ominous form from Maria Sakkari, who holds for 5-3* against Amanda Anisimova with an ace. After 25 minutes, she has 8 winners, 5 errors and she has only lost 4 points on serve so far. A good response from Amanda Anisimova to halt Maria Sakkari\u2019s 3 game run with a quick hold. After more great ballstriking, she dismounted with a searing inside out forehand. Sakkari *4-3 Anisimova. Maria Sakkari rolls through another service game to hold for 4-2. A measure of Sakkari\u2019s physical prowess is that, when it looked like the US Open would not happen, she considered trading her tennis shoes for her spikes and competing at the Greece National Athletic Championships over 100m. Here she is from WTA Insider: \u201cGreece National Championships starts on August 8th. We were kind of joking with my fitness coach, but inside of me I really needed competition. There were rumors going around that the tour would get canceled so I thought if the tour gets canceled I need to find something. \u201cI\u2019m fast. I knew I was not going to win it for sure because I\u2019m not a professional. But yeah, I was thinking of doing that.\u201d \u201c[I can run a] 12.7 without spikes or starting blocks. My fitness coach, who is a track and field specialist, said that if I trained I could probably make the final.\u201d Maria Sakkari takes the first break on Armstrong to lead Amanda Anisimova *3-2. After blowing the first break point with an awful netted backhand slice, Sakkari showed what she is all about at deuce, pulling off a great backhand angled passing shot on the run before putting away the easy forehand that followed. Sakkari is quite short, but she is one of the fittest players in the game and her combination of strength and pace can be brutal. On break point Anisimova double faulted to hand over the break. The only other live singles match right now is on court 5 between the much improved 10th seed Andrey Rublev, who has rolled to a quick 3-0 lead on Salvatore Caruso. 22 year-old Rublev could really make a big run here and has a decent draw, so keep an eye out for him. Amanda Anisimova, who holds to move up 2-1*on Maria Sakkari with a great backhand down the line. Early days. Also in action right now are Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski, unseeded in men\u2019s doubles, who are up against Marcelo Demoliner and Matwe Middelkoop on Court 11. The Brits just held to move up 1-0*. Here is the order of play on the top two courts today. Across the net from Maria Sakkari stands one of the big young talents in the sport, 19 year-old Amanda Anisimova. Anisimova is just a lovely ballstriker with incredible hand-eye coordination - she takes the ball early, she redirects pace with such ease and she already owns one of the best backhands in the game. However, it has been a tough 12 months for her since her father passed away just days before last year\u2019s US Open began. A surprise 2019 semi-finalist at Roland Garros, she is yet to rediscover that form over the past year. Perhaps she will this week. We\u2019re starting today on Louis Armstrong Stadium with a really interesting women\u2019s match between 15th seed Maria Sakkari and 22nd seed Amanda Anisimova. Sakkari has been one of the most improved players over the last few years, steadily rising into the top 20 and marking herself as a talent. She is also in great form, having beaten Serena Williams and Coco Gauff last week to reach the Western &amp; Southern Open quarters on these very courts. This is a huge opportunity to reach the fourth round and beyond, which she has only ever achieved once in her career at this year\u2019s Australian Open. I keep on calling this US Open bizarre because, well, it is. Over the past week we have frequently heard from the 7 players who were deemed to have been in close contact with Benoit Paire. Instead of being forced to withdraw from the tournament and quarantine for 14 days, they have been competing under new protocols and completely separated from other players. Yesterday the story hit new lows as the match between Adrian Mannarino and Alexander Zverev was delayed. Amid endless rumours, what happened was that New York State stepped in and attempted to overrule the City\u2019s decision to allow Mannarino to compete. What followed was tense negotiations until he was finally allowed to play. Here is Mannarino\u2019s explanation after his four set loss to Zverev: Q. Could you explain why the match was delayed at the start? Were you told at any point today that you would not be allowed to play this match? ADRIAN MANNARINO: Well, I was preparing to go on court. Actually was like 2:30pm. We knew there was a not before 2:30pm. I was just trying to get ready, warming up with my coach. I was actually ready to go on court. It was 2:30pm or something. The tour manager came to talk to me at this time. He explained me the situation. Obviously the State Department of Health took over the City actually. The City actually allowed me to play with a new protocol on Sunday. Obviously the State took over this decision to say that I\u2019ve been exposed to a positive case obviously, so I should be quarantined in my room and not be able to go on the tennis court and play the match today. They told me they were trying to contact on phone some guys to see if this decision could be changed. Obviously many effort has been done. They told me, Okay, we decided to put your match not before 5:00. Sascha agreed, which is nice. They told me, We\u2019re going to have a look at the situation, trying to see if we can get you on court today, which obviously they did. Many things might have been happening during this time. I was just trying to get ready. I said myself to be ready to go on court at 5:00. I told my coach if anything happen, I give him my phone, I say, Just try to see what\u2019s going on, I\u2019ll let you handle all these things, I\u2019m just going to try to eat something, get ready, focus, just be prepared as if I was going on court at 5:00. Let\u2019s see if I\u2019m not able to go, then I\u2019m not able to go. But if I\u2019m in a position to be able to play, I just want to be ready. I just want to be thankful to all these people who have been trying to get me on court today. As I say, many effort has been done. I was able to play my tennis match. I\u2019m pretty happy about that. Then I heard actually around 4:30 or 4:40 that I\u2019ve been allowed to go on court today. I needed to be prepared to go at 5:00, which I did. Happen what happened. Unfortunately I lost the match. But still, as I said, I\u2019m happy I was on court. Hello! Welcome to day 6 of an increasingly bizarre US Open where the singles 3rd rounds are slated to begin.
