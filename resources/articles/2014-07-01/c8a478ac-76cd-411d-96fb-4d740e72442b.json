Columba is best known today for helping spread Christianity from Ireland to Scotland, and for founding a monastery at Iona. The music here, associated with this early Irish saint but drawn variously from the seventh, 10th and 14th centuries, has been prepared by Barnaby Brown in collaboration with Geoffrey Webber and his formidable choir. They give a bracing vigour and unusual freedom to this ancient music. Detailed programme notes provide an essential guide, and are worth reading as you listen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
