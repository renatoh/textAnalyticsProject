The Manchester United and England forward has been honoured for his efforts to ensure no child went hungry during the summer holidays, which forced the government into a U-turn over meal vouchers, and on Friday he called on Boris Johnson to extend the scheme over the half-term break. He said: \u201cAs a young black man from Wythenshawe, never did I think I would be accepting an MBE, never mind an MBE at the age of 22.\u201d It was a \u201cvery special moment\u201d for himself and his family. But he added: \u201cThe fight to protect our most vulnerable children is far from over. I would be doing my community, and the families I have met and spoken with, an injustice if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to respectfully urge the prime minister, who recommended me for this honour, to support our children during the October half-term with an extension of the voucher scheme, as the furlough scheme comes to an end and we face increased unemployment.\u201d Postponed from June to include people on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus, the honours list reflects a nation\u2019s thanks to Covid-19 heroes for countless selfless good deeds during the pandemic. Johnson said: \u201cThis year\u2019s honours recipients are a testament to the sort of country we are \u2013 caring, compassionate and resolute in the face of a global pandemic. The hard work and dedication of these local, often unsung heroes has helped carry us through. I congratulate them all.\u201d The majority of the honours go to ordinary people for their extraordinary efforts, with 414 of the 1,495 total going to those on the frontline. With the possibility of a public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, however, the honours committee has striven to steer clear of anyone whose role may later be seen as controversial. Joe Wicks, 35, aka the Body Coach, becomes an MBE for helping children keep active and mentally fit with his online PE lessons and raising \u00a3580,000 for the NHS. He said: \u201cTo all the children, the parents, the dinner ladies, the school teachers, everybody who took part in any one of my workouts, thank you for being there.\u201d Derrick Evans, known as Mr Motivator, who created online home exercises during lockdown, thought he was being scammed when first asked if he would accept his MBE, and said it was \u201cwonderful to be acknowledged in this way\u201d. The rapper Lady Leshurr, awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) after releasing a song reminding people to wash their hands, said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that the Queen of England has noticed and commended the queen of grime.\u201d Away from Covid-19, there are damehoods for the former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry and the actor Maureen Lipman. Berry said she was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d. The singer and actor Tommy Steele, actor David Suchet \u2013 known for his role as Hercule Poirot \u2013 and Phil Redmond, the creator of Grange Hill and Hollyoaks, all become knights. Sir David Attenborough, who was knighted in 1985, is now appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. The British fashion designer Paul Smith, knighted in 2000, has been appointed Companion of Honour, the highest honour. There are CBEs for Prof Brian Cox, the TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, the actor Adrian Lester and the singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading. Armatrading, who moved from Saint Kitts to Birmingham aged seven, said of accepting the honour: \u201cSometimes people talk about the empire days. I think people have long forgotten that was the association.\u201d The honours were just \u201ca country acknowledging its citizens,\u201d she added. The government said this year\u2019s list was the most diverse in honours history, with black and minority ethnic recipients making up 13% of the total, up from 12% in 2019. Healthcare workers make up 14%, including 41 nurses and midwives. However, critics expressed concern about the continuing \u201ccolonial nostalgia\u201d over the honours system. Mike McKie, the founder of Bayleaf Honours, which provides advice and support for people making a nomination for the Queen\u2019s honours, said: \u201cIs the word empire making the process inaccessible or, worse, distressing to potential nominees? Are people of colour being given the same opportunities as their white counterparts in order to be considered for some of these awards in the first place?\u201d He echoed calls made in the past to replace the world \u201cempire\u201d with \u201cexcellence\u201d. A total of 4,000 nominations were received from the public from May onwards, exceeding the number the Cabinet Office normally receives in a year. Dame Louise Casey, the chair of the honours community and voluntary services committee, said this was \u201cindicative of the public\u2019s desire to recognise people and to celebrate them.\u201d One of the oldest recipients is Dabirul Islam Choudhury, 100, who is made an MBE. He raised \u00a3420,000 for the NHS by walking 970 laps of his garden in Bow, east London, throughout Ramadan. \u201cI feel proud they have honoured me for the efforts I have done,\u201d he said. Margaret Payne, 90, from Lochinver, who climbed the 731-metre height of Suilven mountain on her staircase to raise \u00a3430,000 for charity, receives a BEM. \u201cAll those little donations have just built up to an enormous sum and it is amazing,\u201d she said. Ashleigh Linsdell, 30, an NHS nurse from Cambridge who started For the Love of Scrubs to make kit for frontline workers, is made an OBE. More than 70,000 volunteers helped make 1.2m items of PPE and 1m face coverings. \u201cI cried when I found out,\u201d she said of her honour. In the education sector, Matt Hood is awarded an MBE for his prime role in founding the Oak National Academy, a suite of online resources for schools including a video lesson bank to aid the remote learning being offered by schools during lockdown. Katharine Birbalsingh is made a CBE for her work in founding the Michaela community school in Brent in 2014, which has since achieved outstanding exam results. Birbalsingh said the honour was a tribute to her staff and Michaela Emanus, her inspirational colleague who died in 2011 and after whom the school is named. \u201cThis honour is for her and all of the team at Michaela community school, and it is so lovely that the work we have done in her name has been recognised in this way.\u201d The Cabinet Office said this year\u2019s list was the first to have as many as 11% of recipients under the of 30, with Theodore Wride being the youngest at 16. Theodore is awarded the BEM for service to his community in Sunderland during the pandemic. There are 740 women on the list, 49% of the total, which is lower than the 50.7% seen in the New Year honours list last year. Six per cent of people being honoured this time consider themselves to have a disability."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
