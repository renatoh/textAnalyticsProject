The opposition will join forces with Conservative remain supporters and other parties to block article 50 if the prime minister does not guarantee access to the single market, the Labour leader told the Sunday Mirror. The paper said that Corbyn\u2019s four bottom lines were: UK access to 500 million customers in Europe\u2019s single market. No watering down of EU workplace rights. Guarantees on safeguarding consumers and the environment. A promise that Britain will pick up the tab for any EU capital investment lost as a result of Brexit. Corbyn suggested that May, who has a slim Commons majority, would be forced into an early election if she failed to meet Labour demands, according to the newspaper. The government is appealing against a high court ruling ordering that the PM must seek MPs\u2019 approval to trigger article 50. Corbyn told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cThe court has thrown a big spanner in the works by saying parliament must be consulted. We accept the result of the referendum. \u201cWe are not challenging the referendum. We are not calling for a second referendum. We\u2019re calling for market access for British industry to Europe.\u201d The Labour leader dodged calls earlier over whether he would be happy if there was an early election but told the newspaper the party was \u201cready for it\u201d. \u201cWe have the members, the organisation and the enthusiasm. We welcome the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would give us the chance to put before the British people an alternative economic strategy for this country.\u201d It comes after the May was urged to calm the backlash sparked by the controversial high court ruling on the process for leaving the European Union."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
