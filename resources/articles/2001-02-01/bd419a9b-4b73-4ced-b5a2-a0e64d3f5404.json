Kinnear, the former Wimbledon manager, had been touted for the newly created job just days after leaving the same role with the Second Division's bottom club Oxford. Fuccillo said yesterday: \"I have been told that my position is unchanged. If Joe is coming in, it is great for Luton Town.\" Millwall returned to the top of the division after a 3-0 home win over managerless Bristol Rovers . The Lions led through Tim Cahill after 31 minutes but the game exploded soon after when he and Rovers' Dwayne Plummer were sent off after clashing. Paul Moody and Neil Harris scored the others. Stoke extended their unbeaten run to nine games but were dissatisfied with a 1-1 home draw against Northampton. They led through Andy Cooke only for Steve Howard to level 16 minutes from time. In the Third, Chesterfield are 13 points clear after a 1-1 draw at Barnet . An early David Reeves penalty put the leaders in front, but Mark Arber equalised . Blackpool moved into the play-off picture after the 6-0 rout of Scunthorpe, who had Steve Torpey sent off for handball after nine minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
