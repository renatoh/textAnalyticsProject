Mr Alito, 55, who served as a US prosecutor and Reagan administration lawyer before becoming a federal appeals judge in 1990, was nominated by the president, George Bush, to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. With Ms O'Connor often casting a deciding vote on the nine-member panel, her replacement could make a lasting impact in how the US's highest court rules on issues such as abortion and constitutional powers. Supreme court judges are appointed for life. Democrats promised to question Mr Alito's views on the right of privacy, equal rights, abortion and other issues that have occupied the high court for decades. Several criticised his 15-year record as an appellate judge. \"Your record raises troubling questions about whether you appreciate the checks and balances in our constitution - the careful efforts of our founding fathers to protect us from a government or a president determined to seize too much power over our lives,\" said Democrat senator Dick Durbin. Republicans defended Mr Alito as fair-minded and brilliant and said he would be a welcome addition to the court. He \"has a reputation for being an exceptional and honest judge devoted to the rule of law, and a man of integrity\", said the Republican senator Charles Grassley. Mr Alito introduced members of his family - including his wife Martha, sister Rosemary and his son and daughter - and then sat and listened to the opening statements from the first of the judiciary committee's 18 members. The first day of the proceedings was expected to be taken up with opening statements by committee members - 10 Republicans and eight Democrats - followed by an opening statement from Mr Alito. At least two days of questioning of Mr Alito are due to begin tomorrow. The hearings opened amid a growing debate over executive authority and Mr Bush's secret decision to order the National Security Agency to wiretap US citizens in the \"war on terror\". \"In an era when the White House is abusing power, is excusing and authorising torture, and is spying on American citizens, I find Judge Alito's support for an all-powerful executive branch to be genuinely troubling,\" said Senator Edward Kennedy. Mr Alito's opponents are likely to argue that he is in favour of weakening the ability of women and minorities to seek protection under US civil-rights laws and a woman's right to an abortion. He has attracted criticism for his ruling in the 1991 case of Planned Parenthood v Casey, in which he voted to maintain a requirement that women tell their husbands before getting an abortion. The supreme court eventually overturned his judgement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
