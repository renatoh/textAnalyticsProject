Mauger, a member of the successful Crusaders side coached by Deans, was left out of Graham Henry's All Black team for the 20-18 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Cardiff in October. \"Robbie's in the prime of his coaching career and he'd probably be my pick, he'd do a great job,\" said Mauger, who hopes to play against Toulouse on Saturday. \"I've a lot of respect for Graham and the other coaches, it's hard work being All Black coach. But maybe it would be good if [the coaching panel] was freshened up.\" Mauger, 27, believes New Zealand rugby will suffer from the current exodus of All Blacks, many still in their prime. \"I suppose it will be pretty detrimental down the track,\" he said. \"It takes a lot of time to rebuild that experience.\" After 45 caps, however, he said he had no regrets about moving overseas. \"I'm not here to muck around. I'd been playing in New Zealand since 1999 and everything seemed pretty stale. I just wanted to come over here and play a different style of rugby, experience different competitions and play at different grounds. The biggest challenge will be proving myself to a whole new bunch of people.\" New Zealand's World Cup exit affected his thinking. \"I decided the following day there was nothing I could do about it,\" he said. \"Life was going to keep moving so I thought I'd keep moving with it.\" The Leicester coach, Marcelo Loffreda, said: \"He's one of the best No12s in the world. He is used to playing under big pressure so, if he's in the team this weekend, he'll fit in well. He's a top-class player.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
