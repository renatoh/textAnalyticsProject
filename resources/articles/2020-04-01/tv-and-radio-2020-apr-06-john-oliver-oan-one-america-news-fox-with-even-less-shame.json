For example, OAN correspondent Chanel Rion has praised the president for his approval rating, and defended his choice to repeatedly and inaccurately call the coronavirus the \u201cChinese virus\u201d with a \u201cquestion\u201d that somehow invoked \u201cLatin gangs\u201d and \u201cforeign state actors\u201d in what Oliver labeled an \u201casshole sandwich\u201d. In short, Trump loves OAN, as he\u2019s repeatedly said on Twitter \u2013 even, on occasion, praising them above his beloved Fox News. \u201cLook, OAN is a relatively small organization, but you may well know someone who watches them,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cAnd they\u2019re punching way above their weight right now.\u201d OAN is the brainchild of Robert Herring, a conservative millionaire from California who, according to Oliver, looks like a \u201csun-dried Jake Gyllenhaal\u201d. And since its founding, the network has been a home for \u201cextreme conservatism\u201d. See: its hosts, such as Graham Ledger, who called the Black Lives Matter movement a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d, being transgender \u201ca mental problem\u201d, and said Muslims shouldn\u2019t enter the country. His starting line for every show is: \u201cThe doors to the newsroom are locked and the \u2018pc police\u2019 are not getting in.\u201d Then there\u2019s Rion, who runs a word-appreciation website called \u201cWelcome to Wordeby\u2019s\u201d whose \u201cAbout\u201d page reads: \u201cIf we don\u2019t nurture and grow our WORD REALMS, we don\u2019t nurture and grow our THOUGHT REALMS.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how to describe a sentence like that,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThankfully, Wordeby\u2019s has an entry on \u2018fanfaronade,\u2019 which means \u2018empty, self-promoting language,\u2019 and that seems to hit the nail right on the head.\u201d It\u2019s not just far-right hosts and talking points, Oliver continued; the network has also promoted conspiracy theories, such as offering $100k for information in conspiracy target Seth Rich\u2019s murder. Last year, they traveled with Trump sidekick Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to film a series about his \u201cinvestigations\u201d in the country, and Rion recently hosted a special boosting a conspiracy theory that coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon in a lab in North Carolina. \u201cThe whole selling point of OAN is that they are Fox News with even less shame, and even fewer scruples,\u201d Oliver said. It\u2019s also \u201cprophetically thirsty\u201d for the president\u2019s attention, which means \u201cyou do kind of get what OAN and the president see in each other.\u201d It\u2019s easy to dismiss OAN as little-watched and \u201cborderline self-parody,\u201d Oliver continued, but \u201cthe problem is, if we\u2019re learning one thing right now, it\u2019s that toxic things that start small can get big fast, and it\u2019s dangerous to ignore them\u201d. Especially if the president is focusing on OAN at the expense of the pandemic; last week, he retweeted a video of OAN host Liz Wheeler supporting her book that she posted last August (\u201cLiking someone\u2019s post from seven months ago? Is the creepiest thing on earth,\u201d said Oliver). And Rion was personally invited to continue attending briefings despite her restriction because of social distancing protocols. \u201cAnd that is a problem,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cbecause in the best of times, you can laugh at an almost Anchorman-esque parody of right-wing news. But much like the problem with Anchorman 2, it\u2019s just not the right time for Ron Burgundy right now.\u201d \u201cOAN\u2019s weird combination of far right-wing talking points and dirt-stupid reporting is incredibly dangerous at a time like this,\u201d said Oliver, noting that host Ledger has explicitly called for people to defy the government\u2019s advice on social distancing. The point is, Oliver concluded, that \u201cthe kind of misinformation OAN is spewing right now could end up getting people killed. And sadly, their message is being actively spread by the White House, so it is more important than ever to be on the lookout for OAN\u2019s bullshit and to make sure no one that you know is falling for it either.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
