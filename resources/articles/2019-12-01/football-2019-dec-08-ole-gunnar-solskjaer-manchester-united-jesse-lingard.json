The champions were beaten 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium, with United as impressive as they were in the midweek win against Tottenham. Yet despite Chelsea also previously being beaten and the leaders Liverpool held to a draw, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side have lost against Crystal Palace, West Ham, Newcastle and Bournemouth. Their next league matches are against Everton, Watford, Newcastle and Burnley and the manager is intent that performance does not dip. Asked if the four league losses were as a result of a mental issue, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cThat\u2019s up to me, to make sure that for every single game they know they have to earn the right to win a game of football. You\u2019ve got to earn the right to win. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to earn it by passing quicker, winning the ball back \u2013 there are different ways of winning games of football. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with the mentality of the boys. It\u2019s been very much about margins in those games [we lost]. But if you look behind the results I\u2019m not as negative as you are. I\u2019m not so worried, so concerned. If the boys are then telling me they can\u2019t get up for these games \u2013 then we\u2019ve got a problem. Then I\u2019ve really got to work with them because when I played that\u2019s how we won the league. We never gave points away against the lesser teams, the not-so-good teams. The Premier League is difficult \u2013 if you don\u2019t have that mentality, you won\u2019t get results. I\u2019ll work on the mentality.\u201d Victory against City took United to fifth place with 24 points, five away from a Champions League berth, and Solskj\u00e6r praised how the champions were taken apart. \u201cWe know we can play quick, attacking football when we get the shape right, as we did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attitude was spot-on and every time we had the ball it seemed like we could carve them open. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was two passes or four passes or 10. The first half was attacking football as it should be played.\u201d Jesse Lingard was a standout performer in the Spurs and City wins following injury and a prolonged dip in form. He was also reprimanded in the summer by the manager for a video posted on social media and Solskj\u00e6r alluded to this. \u201cHe\u2019s Man United through and through. He\u2019s a red, he\u2019s got a great attitude and a great work rate. Every one of us have things to deal with on the pitch and off the pitch and what he has had to deal with, that will be between us. It\u2019s great to see him back. \u201cYou can criticise anyone about anything but for me as a manager, I have to look after these boys in the good and the bad times. It\u2019s great to work with him. I had him in the reserves; gave him his debut against Burnley. It\u2019s good to see him back to his old self.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
