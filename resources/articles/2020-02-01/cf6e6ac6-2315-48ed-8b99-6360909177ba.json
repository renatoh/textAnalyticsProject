The Stanford University graduate, who was a pioneer of early computing, died on Monday in San Francisco. He worked for blue-chip firms including Apple, Amazon and Yahoo. Tesler appropriately began his Silicon Valley career at photocopying company Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center (Parc) before being recruited by Apple\u2019s founder, Steve Jobs. Xerox wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe inventor of cut/copy &amp; paste, find &amp; replace, and more, was former Xerox researcher Larry Tesler. Your workday is easier thanks to his revolutionary ideas.\u201d Tesler worked at Apple for 17 years and rose through the ranks to become chief scientist. The scientist was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1945, and worked in the genesis stage of computers in the 1960s, aiming to make them more accessible and intuitive. He specialised in user interface design and is most famous for devising the cut and paste command alongside his colleague Tim Mott at Parc. It updated the old method of editing in which people would physically cut portions of printed text and glue them elsewhere. The command was incorporated into Apple\u2019s software on the Lisa computer in 1983 and on the original Macintosh the following year. A young Jobs visited Parc in 1974 and was shown around by Tesler. The scientist showed the future Apple boss the firm\u2019s prototype Alto personal computer and moved the cursor across the screen with the aid of a \u201cmouse\u201d. Whereas directing a computer had previously meant typing a command on the keyboard, Tesler just clicked on one of the icons on the screen. He recalled: \u201cSteve started jumping around the room, shouting, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you doing anything with this? This is the greatest thing. This is revolutionary!\u2019\u201d He also introduced the scroll bar on the Macintosh computer. Silicon Valley\u2019s Computer History Museum said Tesler \u201ccombined computer science training with a counterculture vision that computers should be for everyone\u201d. One of his strongest principles was that computer systems should stop using \u201cmodes\u201d, which allow users to switch between functions on software and apps but make computers time-consuming and complicated. His website was even called \u201cnomodes.com\u201d, his Twitter handle was \u201c@nomodes\u201d, and his car registration plate also read \u201cNo Modes\u201d. In a 2012 interview with the BBC, he spoke of the culture at Silicon Valley. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s almost a rite of passage. After you\u2019ve made some money, you don\u2019t just retire, you spend your time funding other companies. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong element of excitement, of being able to share what you\u2019ve learned with the next generation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
