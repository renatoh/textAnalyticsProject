The Equality and Human Rights Commission revealed it had identified a number of significant problems, such as old people not being washed properly, not being given proper help with eating or drinking, and being left in bed for 17 hours in some cases, as part of an EHRC inquiry into home care in England. Staff turnover in the sector was \"huge\" with one woman said to have had 32 different carers over a two-week period. Some home care visits were just 15 minutes, forcing people to choose between having a cooked meal or a wash. Others were put to bed at 5pm and not helped to get up again until 10am the following morning, said the report. Lack of privacy was also a problem, with one person complaining of being dressed by care staff in front of his bungalow window, and another in front of family members. But there was a reluctance to complain because many did not know how to, or were fearful of repercussions. \"The full extent of the potential human rights breaches is likely to be masked by the fear of complaining and the low expectations about the quality of home care that many older people believe they are entitled to,\" said the EHRC, due to publish the findings of its inquiry in November. \"One in five older people who responded to the call for evidence said that they would not complain because they didn't know how to, or for fear of repercussions. \"In addition, we are exploring what protection and support is in place for whistleblowers who want to expose poor or abusive practices,\" said the report, drawn from more than 500 submissions from individuals, organisations and home care staff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
