The BBC loves him, of course (seeing him as a maverick in the mould of Dennis Potter), and I loved him once myself, for his flawless Caught on a Train, with Peggy Ashcroft and Michael Kitchen, but that was in 1980. He's had his moments since \u2013 The Lost Prince was loudly applauded as recently as 10 years ago \u2013 but can anyone ever actually trust him? Last week's double helping of Dancing on the Edge \u2013 his new five-parter about an early 1930s multiracial jazz band moving in fashionable London society \u2013 didn't augur an obvious triumph (except in so far as I didn't actively want to switch it off), though it had me tapping my toes in expectation, encouraged by an opening teaser scene in which a well-spoken \"coloured\" gentleman in evening clothes and top hat conveyed with surprising calmness an urgent need to flee the country. Poliakoff was in no such hurry, happy to feed us one amuse-bouche after another as the band \u2013 plucked from the clutches of immigration officials by a group of adoring, laughing socialites \u2013 rose to the top of the bill and were presently hobnobbing with royalty and living on cakes and champagne in a ritzy hotel (Mel Smith, too little seen these days, was well cast as the moody proprietor). The production looked the part, with its trundling fleet of vintage cars, glittering set pieces and generous views of aristocratic parkland. The leading men were sound. Chiwetel Ejiofor brought a quiet authority to bandleader Louis while Matthew Goode wore a likable grin as journo and showbiz tout Stanley. The women \u2013 powdered and perfumed \u2013 sparkled and smouldered. Romance was in the air. And mystery! Anthony Head surfaced as a suave puller of strings; John Goodman played a sinister American tycoon who smacked a girl black and blue around his trashed palatial suite (if indeed it was him\u2026), then hired a train for a grand picnic. Freemasons were spied in their aprons and gloves. Stuffed shirts from the BBC and HMV were leaned on from high to get the band on the radio and into the shops. But why? Had our smart and influential set really nothing better to do than sit around being awed by polite jazz (despite party animal Prince George's enthusiasm for the band, you couldn't quite get it into your head that they were supposed to be the Sex Pistols of the day)? Intrigue piled on intrigue. Conversations progressed with such narcotic slowness that you found yourself wondering what point you were missing. And why did the camera dwell so weirdly on Stanley's magazine cartoon strip \u2013 was he sending coded messages to the Nazis? Was he trying to get Louis and the crew booked for the Berlin Olympics? Anything could happen, though not necessarily before you grew a beard. Episode two ended with a slashed throat in a linen cupboard. Any excuse for a mess, but it was progress of a sort. Gory visuals come as standard in the excellent French cops and lawyers drama Spiral, back in BBC4's Saturday night EU slot now that Borgen is done for another season. And conversations tend to be short. Why waste subtitles when what you want to say can be expressed by dragging someone across the floor by the hair? Things were brutal. Here was a gang terrorising bank staff; there a cadaver split open like a butcher's cow (the police were looking into it); here a detainee setting himself ablaze. We saw how one story clicked with the next (the show's French title, Engrenages, means \"gears\" or \u2013 even less tuneful to the translator's ear \u2013 \"cogs\"), and we were soon enjoying an undulating plot involving illegal aliens, people traffickers and bomb makers. But, as is often the case, the most pressing concern in Spiral wasn't to find out who did or didn't chop someone's hands off, but whether its chaotic central trio of detectives \u2013 or indeed their antagonists in the Palais de Justice \u2013 could keep out of jail themselves. Hot-headed Captain Berthaud (Caroline Proust) was busy trying to squirm out of a charge of murdering a suspect in the last series, while Gilou, her coke-snorting oaf of a lieutenant, drifted into yet another inadvisable alliance with Arab lowlife (I can't work out if Spiral is being pointed or shameless in the way it depicts its ethnic minorities as criminals or cleaning staff or, in the case of one individual, a belly dancer). Trouble likewise brewed for the lovebird lawyers \u2013 handsome Pierrecorrect (last seen denying a child sex abuse charge) and sexy, leather-hearted Jos\u00e9phine, whom you could easily imagine (in the words of the old song) pouring water on a drowning man. But missing from the scene was wise Judge Roban (the one who looks like Ars\u00e8ne Wenger drawn by Matt Groening), witnessed not long ago on the brink of suffocating his mother with a pillow. I hope he's back soon. It's hard not to like Spiral, if only for the work that has gone into making it so unglamorous. Bravo to whoever has the job of dipping all the characters in the same shade of mud. It goes without saying that no one watches this in the hope of spotting the Eiffel Tower. When Albums Ruled the World, part of the BBC's Golden Age of the Album season, was an excuse to play lots of 70s prog rock and show us the 19 naked women on the gatefold of Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, though it also had points to make about the artistic possibilities afforded by long-playing vinyl and why it so perfectly accommodated the needs of seated drug users. The amazing thing, though, was the mushrooming of small labels into business empires. How alarming to think that without Tubular Bells there might well have been no Virgin Trains. David Attenborough's superb Africa series \u2013 full of vivid images, elegiac but forward-looking \u2013 ended with a roar and a grunt and a tear. Who could resist the great man, his white hair stiff in the breeze, exchanging squeals with a blind baby rhinoceros?
