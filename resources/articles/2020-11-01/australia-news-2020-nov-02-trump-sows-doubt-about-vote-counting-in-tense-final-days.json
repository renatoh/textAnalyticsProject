If this were a normal presidential campaign, you might expect the final days to be about polling, last-minute trips to swing states and the candidates\u2019 closing pitch to voters. But this isn\u2019t a normal presidential campaign, obviously. Instead, the headlines dominating the 10,000 years between the last day of October and 3 November are about the president and his party attempting to subvert the democratic process itself. Fears were heightened by an Axios report on Sunday saying the president had openly canvassed declaring himself a winner on election night if he is ahead in key states and claiming any subsequent shift in the count was evidence of electoral fraud. Trump denied the report, but continued to suggest publicly that counting after 3 November should not be allowed and raised the spectre of swift legal challenges. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing when states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over.\u201d \u201cAs soon as the election is over - we\u2019re going in with our lawyers.\u201d The notion that ballot counting should stop on election night is, as my US colleagues write, a \u201clegal and political fiction.\u201d States have never been expected to tabulate final results in a single day. Stopping the count on election night would disenfranchise an enormous number of voters casting valid ballots \u2013 this year more than any other, given the unprecedented rate of voting by mail during the pandemic and delays in the delivery of mail-in ballots. Some counties in the crucial state of Pennsylvania won\u2019t begin counting mail-in ballots until the next day, according to the NYT. You can read our full story here. The move comes amid a number of ongoing legal challenges to vote counting that threaten to see thousands of mail-in or drop box ballots in key states thrown out (see our story on Texas below) or go uncounted. You can read more about voter suppression here. Far from just a test of the two candidates, this election is very clearly shaping up to be a test of American democracy itself. The big stories The US should prepare for \u201ca whole lot of hurt\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci has said in an interview, predicting a winter of 100,000 or more Covid cases a day and a rising death toll. Dr Fauci also said Biden was taking the pandemic seriously from a public health perspective, comments which drew a rebuke from the White House. The president endorsed a group of supporters who surrounded a Biden campaign bus on a Texas highway as \u201cpatriots\u201d. Biden accused the convoy of trying to run his people off the road and the FBI is now investigating the incident. The Texas supreme court on Sunday denied a Republican-led petition to throw out nearly 127,000 ballots cast at drive-through voting places in the Houston area. The matter is still set to be taken up during an emergency hearing in federal court on Monday. Travelling through battleground states in the lead-up to the election has been like passing through two parallel dimensions, where common ground between two factions of the same nation can feel nonexistent. This report looks at the deeply divided country on the eve of the election. Biden is the favourite heading into election day, but his fortunes haven\u2019t always seemed so bright, and it was by no means a certainty that he would make it to this moment. This feature looks back at his unlikely ascension to the Democratic ticket and how it\u2019s shaped his campaign. Americans are voting by mail in record numbers \u2013 and that could extend the counting process several days if not weeks. This explainer looks at the counting process and why it\u2019s normal for results not be in by the end of election night. Quote of the day We\u2019re all fucking nervous as shit.\u201d A Democratic strategist on the pre-election mood. Election views \u201cAt the heart of a broken America is its system of democracy,\u201d writes John Mulholland, citing gerrymandering, voter suppression and an electoral system that sees California\u2019s 40 million residents represented by the same number of senators as Wyoming (population 570, 000). \u201cIn 2020, America has shown itself to be exceptional in the worst possible ways. No other rich country has such a poor public health infrastructure or such a tattered social safety net,\u201d writes Bhaskar Sunkara. \u201cThe left must find a way to not just popularise our goals, but secure the means \u2013 institutional reform \u2013 to achieve them.\u201d Video of the day The physical fitness of men in politics is often weirdly conflated with their ability as leaders, which is dumb and ableist, obviously. But let us take a moment to just appreciate this shot. Around the web \u201cExplosive Republican turnout on Election Day \u2026 tepid enthusiasm for Biden, especially among young people of colour; disruptions at polling places that depress Democratic turnout; legal victories related to ballot counting \u2026\u201d. This Politico piece is a clear explainer of how Trump could win despite the polls. This election is a watershed moment in American journalism, Margaret Sullivan writes in the Washington Post, because any uncertainty around the results will test the media\u2019s ability to \u201cbe patient, to linger with the uncertainty and to explain relentlessly rather than join a rush to judgment.\u201d This is nice. First time voters \u2013 young people and newly naturalised citizens \u2013 are being greeted with cheers and applause at polling booths around the country, writes Buzzfeed. What the numbers say: 17 million The number of guns Americans have purchased in 2020, more than any other year on record, according to the LA Times.
