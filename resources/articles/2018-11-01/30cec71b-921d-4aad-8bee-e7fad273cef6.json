Eddie Jones also hopes the input of the former All Blacks coach John Mitchell, now in England\u2019s camp, will enable his side to \u201cclimb Everest\u201d by toppling the world\u2019s No 1 side on Saturday. Jones, optimistic both Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes will be fit, says England aim to take a leaf out of the Lions book at Twickenham. \u201cWhen our boys played for the Lions we got them to do notes about what they felt worked and didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through those notes and had a meeting with the senior players. The Lions put a lot of pressure on the All Blacks in areas they didn\u2019t enjoy. There\u2019s a bit to be learned there.\u201d Heaping pressure on the New Zealand lineout and playmakers such as Beauden Barrett certainly played a part in the Lions\u2019 1-1 series draw in the summer of 2017 and Jones believes his team can go one better. \u201cWe need to be absolutely brutal upfront and we need to be clinical when we get opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look back at that Lions series, the Lions would have won if they had been more clinical.\u201d With the flanker Tom Curry sidelined Jones accepts it will not be easy. \u201cWhen you beat New Zealand, you climb Everest. Rugby means so much to them. When they win the whole country\u2019s buoyant, when they lose GDP falls and unemployment goes up. I don\u2019t think [England beating South Africa] will have such a significant effect on Brexit here. Imagine if Theresa May comes out and says: \u2018We got the result because we hung in there.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d After Owen Farrell\u2019s contentious tackle in the final moments of Saturday\u2019s Springboks game, Jones believes modern Tests are so intense they should be controlled by two referees. \u201cAt some stage in the future, probably not in my time, they may have to look at two referees on the field. We are asking one referee to do it the way they did it when blokes like me were playing, jogging round the field basically,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
