We take insults seriously, Eric, Zizou and  I - we hit out,  we avenge ...", "bodyText": "We may soon know exactly what Materazzi said to Zidane, but we probably won't. Zidane will tell us what he sincerely thought the Italian told him; this will quickly be denied and some far more benign remark offered as to what was really said. The truth may escape for ever. We have been here before. Remember Eric Cantona's elegant aerial feet-first lunge at the spectator who had allegedly made aspersions about the footballer's mother? The victim of Cantona's anger claimed (really) that, following a foul, he remarked: \"Off you go Cantona, it's an early bath for you.\" I'm tempted to say that the truth is somewhere in between, but I can't think of what that could be, except perhaps, if Cantona's mum was somehow saucily involved in the premature cleansing. But have you noticed the crucial common factor between the two footballing perpetrators? Yup, both born in Marseille. As indeed was I. We're pretty touchy down there. We take insults seriously, all the more so if they touch on family honour. We - Eric, Zizou and I - retaliate, we hit out, we avenge. I admit I haven't done any of those recently, perhaps due to a lack of insults coming my way (none, to be exact). But the Marseillais spirit still lurks in me, as I realised when watching the game in my small Proven\u00e7al village, not all that far from my native city. When Zidane performed his unusual head-butt, (aimed at his opponent's chest rather than his nose and forehead, as in the more traditional \"Glasgow Kiss\") it was obvious that the Italian must have seriously provoked him (though none of us knew how). My first thought was not, as it should have been, \"stupid Zidane\", but, \"I wonder what Materazzi did.\" The reaction in France, both in my tiny southern corner and in the national press, has been much the same: severely critical of what he did (the word unpardonable appears often), very sad that his career has ended in that ignominious way, angry with the provocative Italian, but determined to remember and praise him for his past achievements. It was an emotional front-page editorial in the sporting daily L'Equipe that raised the issue that the rest of the press mostly ignored. The most difficult thing, it said, addressing Zidane directly, was not to try to understand why the team lost the game, but \"to explain to tens of millions of children all over the world how you could have let yourself strike Marco Materazzi with that head-butt ...\" That's the question that matters most: what do we tell the children? Zidane has been a national hero and role model for French youth - not just boys - on a scale unimaginable in England. Beckham, even at the summit of his talent and fame, came nowhere near. It isn't just Zidane's footballing genius that has dazzled France, but his whole life, rising to eminence from a poor immigrant family while remaining likeable, humble and imbued with traditional values. So the question posed by L'Equipe is not a flippant one; Zidane's feet of clay have the capacity to wound the nation's youth. I've never been convinced by the purported power of so-called role models to affect their worshippers significantly. I'm especially sceptical of the accusation that they, to put it exaggeratedly, exert enough influence to turn good kids bad. The charge against Zidane is that he has set a terrible example, which can only influence his millions of followers for the worse. I doubt it. I do not deny that children are playing football at a lower ethical level than they used to, and that the decline in standards of sportsmanship is the result of adopting the unattractive habits of grown-ups. Watch schoolboy soccer and see young players roll over in agony when lightly touched (if at all) by an opponent, claim fouls that they know have not occurred on the off-chance that, once in every 20 appeals perhaps, the referee will be fooled, commit fouls on others and immediately throw up their hands and assume a facial expression of innocence, and go through the many other motions of what now passes for \"gamesmanship\", as nationally advertised on our television screens. Football is not of course the only sport in which this degradation of behaviour has taken place, but it is the most popular. I am loath to descend from the general to the specific. I do not believe that the millions of children who saw Zidane's head-butt have been telling themselves: \"Well if my hero, the man even my parents worship, can do it, it's OK for me to follow his example.\" For one thing, he did not get away with it - he paid the penalty of being sent off, a warning to the watching children rather than an encouragement. And I believe that parents all over France have been telling their children that even Zidane the saint has behaved very badly. The apparent national mood of forgiveness of someone who has done so much for his country does not mean that the French are condoning or defending his action. The debate is not limited to a field of play. When Kate Moss was widely publicised to be snorting coke, much was made in the media of her alleged status as role model for young girls. They admire her achievements and, broadly, her lifestyle; many aspire, however unrealistically, to be like her, just as French boys want to emulate Zidane. The worry is that children will absorb the bad attributes of a hero as well as his or her virtues. But I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that teenage girls are turning to drugs just because Kate Moss indulges, or that they're behaving badly because they've read about the way Naomi Campbell treats her staff. I accept that there is one area of concern. There is some evidence that trying to copy the body of a catwalk-model role model can lead a girl into anorexia and other eating disorders. There is no equivalent harm for boys anxious to become top footballers. I expect that Zidane will soon publicly explain his action and apologise to the nation for not having the maturity to resist reprisals. France has already started to demonstrate its wish to forgive what two days ago was portrayed as unforgivable. French children will not suddenly adopt head-butting as a legitimate sporting tool. Zidane's rehabilitation will not take long. The fact is that France needs him as its hero. There's no one else around to take his place. \u00b7 This week Marcel watched a late-night showing of the 1971 Clint Eastwood film Play Misty for Me, \"which, when I first saw it, convinced me that Eastwood had it in him to be a great director. But I switched off before the scary bits, which are really scary.\" To calm down, Marcel read some SJ Perelman, \"who still makes me laugh aloud more than any other other humourist.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
