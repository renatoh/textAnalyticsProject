It is part of the Sunderland manager\u2019s endeavour to reconnect the club with its often disillusioned local fan base but he also hopes some of the feel-good factor engendered by news of the Japanese company\u2019s freshly reaffirmed commitment to Wearside may rub off on his struggling players. \u201cI tell you what, some of us might be looking for a job in that Nissan factory soon,\u201d joked Moyes, whose side seek their first Premier League win of the season at home against Arsenal on Saturday lunchtime. \u201cWe\u2019re all going next week. We\u2019re trying to get closer to the local community. We need them.\u201d Despite collecting two points from his first nine league games since succeeding Sam Allardyce in July, Moyes retains the staunch support of Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner, and Martin Bain, the chief executive. That does not prevent some supporters clamouring for the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager\u2019s dismissal but Moyes is determined not to be distracted by this disgruntled, dissenting soundtrack. Instead the club\u2019s seventh manager in five years is convinced he must press ahead with an attempt to seek a longer- term solution centred on more possession-based tactics and better passing, rather than resort to the quick tactical fixes deployed by certain predecessors. His problem is that this involves surmounting a considerable pain barrier. \u201cI think whoever was going to make this better was going to take a lot of poison until they got to the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m having to take my poison just now but this is a club that has struggled for a long time.\u201d Moyes is confident that Sunderland are \u201cdefinitely improving\u201d but accepts that imminent wins are imperative. \u201cWe need results to show that things are going in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone judges by results. \u201cI don\u2019t feel pressure from people I work with \u2013 Ellis and Martin have been very supportive \u2013 but I think the truth is that sometimes the noise outside the building can become bigger than the noise inside it. You can\u2019t keep losing. You have to pick up wins. I\u2019m a big boy and I know that needs to happen. I would think tomorrow would be a difficult atmosphere but we\u2019re going to have around 45,000 supporters and they\u2019ve got a chance to make it a great atmosphere against Arsenal.\u201d He is encouraged by a conviction that his squad are behind him. \u201cI think the players are enjoying it,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cWe\u2019re not brilliant but we\u2019re passing it better. We\u2019re trying to get them to play better, to pass it more and we\u2019re encouraging them to take the ball at the back and play. \u201cWe want to play through the middle of the pitch, we want to get more crosses into the box. I don\u2019t want to be sitting back defending, kicking the ball up the pitch and chasing it all game. I don\u2019t want to do that. But I have not, at the moment, been able to find a style or a group of players able to win games. It\u2019s been difficult.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
