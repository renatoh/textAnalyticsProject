It was a landmark occasion for Robert Earnshaw, whose goal in the fourth minute was the 150th of his career. The Welsh striker, restored to Billy Davies's team, struck from close range after a flick by Paul Anderson to give Forest a lead they were never in danger of losing. Earnshaw's early strike was all Forest required as the Blades struggled to find a way back. They were knocked out of their stride by the concession and Forest dominated for much of the encounter, and only a poor finish from Anderson after a free-flowing move led by Chris Cohen kept it competitive. United's task was made even harder by a moment of foolish petulance by the striker Darius Henderson, whose apparent elbow on Forest's Kevin Wilson earned him a red card. The loss of Henderson seemed to restore fight to United's game however and Mark Yeates twice came close to an equaliser for the 10 men. It was not to be however, and by the end Forest had stamped their dominance on the game, with Mark Bunn forced to save well late on from Nathan Tyson. While the defeat kept Kevin Blackwell's side just outside the play-off positions, they could be cheered by the failure of the sides above them to take full advantage. There was late drama between Bristol City and sixth-placed Leicester City, as David Clarkson scored at the start of stoppage time to seemingly secure three points for the hosts, only for Lloyd Dyer to equalise for Leicester. Swansea City, in fourth, were also left frustrated, throwing away a lead given to them by Darren Pratley by allowing Damien Johnson to grab a point with his first goal for three years for Plymouth Argyle in the 87th minute. The chasing pack, as clustered as ever, enjoyed mixed results. Blackpool, who had endured five games without a win, ended Middlesbrough's run of six games unbeaten to go above Gordon Strachan's side. Brett Ormerord converted Gary Taylor-Fletcher's cross after 30 minutes for Blackpool, who had Rob Edwards sent off after an hour, and DJ Campbell made it two in stoppage time. Derby County are building up steam at just the right time after a thrilling 5-3 win over Preston North End. Jon Parkin gave the visitors an early lead, but they were soon pegged back by Billy Jones's own goal. Kris Commons put Derby in front early in the second half, and despite an equaliser from Chris Sedgwick, a double from Rob Hulse and Shaun Barker's strike sealed the win. Chris Brown grabbed a late consolation. Meanwhile QPR's game against Watford was called off due to a waterlogged pitch at Loftus Road. In League One, Leeds United's poor form continued as they lost 2-1 at home to Walsall, their first defeat at Elland Road for 26 games. Dwayne Mattis put the visitors ahead with a fierce volley from just inside the area almost immediately after half-time, and although Gary McSheffrey equalised for Leeds following an error from Clayton Ince, Walsall stayed firm, Clayton McDonald bundling in the winner nine minutes before the end. Leeds, who have been struggling ever since their exploits against Premier League opposition in the FA Cup, are four points behind the leaders Norwich City but with a game in hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
