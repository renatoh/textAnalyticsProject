Here, for the first time, the author of the song's contentious lyrics, Mike Batt - also the man behind the Wombles theme tune - responds. Cavemen probably had primitive scientists who \"knew\" that electricity didn't exist. Simon Singh's article about my song Nine Million Bicycles, which is currently a top 10 hit sung by the enigmatic Katie Melua - takes issue with her \"guess\" (or mine, actually) - that \"we are 12bn light years from the edge\". He says \"Kate Melua has no right to call the age of the universe a 'guess' or quote it as 12bn years old when we now know it to be 13.7bn years old\". I would remind Mr Singh that if we are talking in billions of years, 0.7 of a billion is a vague approximation in itself. The song does not \"guess\" which edge we are 12bn light years from. Could it not be the edge of a planet or star which happens to be (according to current scientific estimation based on available information) 1.7bn light years this side of the edge of the observable universe, which he claims to be 13.7bn light years away? This would satisfy his scientific zeal, and honour would be saved all round. As for the word \"guess\", I would point out that his own, very funny, rewrite of my verse (for which I grant copyright permission in arrears without charge) does itself contain the words \"good estimate\", which is not a million miles (or 12bn light years) away from a guess. I should also point out that it is only Katie's guess that is being expressed in the song, not that of scientists. He is right to concentrate on the first verse, because it contains the only claimed-as-true fact on the record - namely the number of bicycles in Beijing - although he does not challenge that claim. Others have. Somebody said that there are in fact 10 million bicycles in Beijing. Perhaps if I had added \"at least\" before the words \"nine million\" I would have covered myself better, and the song would have been more accurate. Next year there may be 11 million. Perhaps they are breeding, but hopefully Chinese law allows only one baby bicycle per couple of bicycles or tandem. I was, in fact, told by a very attractive Chinese tour guide called Selina, less than five months ago, that the number is indeed nine million. I believe most things told to me by beautiful women, but then I am an artist, not a scientist. The true figure could, of course, be 9.2346 million but in this world of approximations, I'm sure Mr Singh (or perhaps everyone but him) will forgive my rounding the figure down. As a scientific pedant, I'm sure he will accept the apology of one pedant to another (my pedantry being directed towards use of the English language) for the fact that the fourth sentence of this article ends with a preposition, but at least I am not one to flagrantly split an infinitive, as he does by using the phrase \"to objectively measure\". Scientists are allowed to split atoms, but please lay off infinitives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
