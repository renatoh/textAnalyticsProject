While football folk across the world are plotting their strategies for Germany 2006, it's only decent to spare a thought for those less fortunate. For the outsiders, a World Cup year brings depression, isolation, helplessness. Nobody will be suffering as much as Velibor Milutinovic. Better known as 'Bora', this 62-year-old nomad and footballing romantic is the World Cup's most ubiquitous coach. Guus Hiddink (approaching his third tournament in charge of a different country) and Carlos Alberto Perreira (finals under four different flags) look like amateurs compared to Bora. He is the don: five successive tournaments, each time with a different nation. Now, for the first time in 20 years, Bora has no team. As if by instinct, four weeks ago Bora took himself off to the draw in Leipzig. The mere sight of him should have been enough to make the 32 coaches for next summer twitch. Bora would pickpocket any of their jobs without batting an eyelid. \"I want to carry on doing what has helped me become a citizen of the world,\" he proclaims. For the first time in years Bora is out of work. His latest spell in club football in Qatar was deliberately on a short-term contract so he would be available for the World Cup. Since last summer he has been waiting. And waiting. There were rumours he was in for the Hearts job, but now is not the time for such shenanigans. \"Club football has too many obligations, it's not my character to get involved in all that,\" he says. \"National team work is the thing for me.\" That does not mean Bora just wants an easy life. Since he left his native Serbia four decades ago he has been on the road with little but his enduring charisma and footballing imagination for company. He met his wife while coach of Mexico, but he has learnt to love his family from afar. The Mexicans were first to fall for his abundant charms, in 1986, when they hosted the finals. After guiding Costa Rica to the knockout phase in 1990, Bora took charge of 1994 hosts United States, then Nigeria in 1998. The biggest test of all was guiding China to qualification for 2002. Having threatened to throw himself off the Great Wall if he failed, his reputation - and bones - survived and the Chinese expressed their gratitude by erecting a monument in his honour. As one of his old friends once said: \"His secret is that he knows how to make a good mayonnaise.\" Give him the basic ingredients and he will blend you a team with the right consistency. Bora's bid to extend his World Cup record to six out of six went sour in Honduras. Even though he was earning a fraction of Sven-Goran Eriksson's \u00a34 million a year, his salary caused deep discontent in a country where half the population earn less than a dollar a day. When the head of the Honduran church got involved, Bora got out. \"Nowhere have I been treated like some kind of criminal as I was here. It became a miserable existence,\" he laments. \"Money is not the only motivation for a coach. I was happiest when I was earning the least amount of money - and that was when I was coaching Costa Rica. I was at my lowest ebb at the World Cup in Korea and Japan. I would have given up all my money for just a single point for China.\" Bora has bounced back and the person who cares most about the upcoming African Cup of Nations, which begins this month in Egypt, is an eccentric Serbian who lives in Mexico. If one of the five African qualifiers has a real stinker in Egypt, Bora will be there in a jiffy. It won't feel like a real World Cup without him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
