The England striker's name was read out over the public-address at half-time, the goal not his 159th for Liverpool but his first for Real Madrid; Owen is missed in these parts. In his absence, the locals laboured back on Merseyside. Since the Englishman's sale to Real in August there has been a flimsy feel to Liverpool's front line which was hardly dispelled by events in last night's Group A 0-0 stalemate here. Rafael Ben\u00edtez tried five different attacking combinations against Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a, switching and swapping personnel in desperation. None managed to produce the critical goal, and that left Liverpool, and this group, in limbo. Frustration is surfacing most readily in Djibril Ciss\u00e9. The Frenchman grudgingly endures his club record \u00a314.1m price tag but, with three goals in 12 games since arriving from Auxerre, he cut an angry figure as he stomped off the turf here with 14 minutes remaining, flinging a water bottle to the turf. \"It's only natural that, when you haven't won, you're not happy,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"But he ran, he fought hard. He was just unlucky not to score. He works hard in training and I'm sure the goals will come from him sooner rather than later.\" The pressure the Frenchman feels will presumably only mount if Owen has begun one of his trademark scoring bursts in Spain. Ciss\u00e9's best opportunity here arrived early, Luis Garcia's run thwarted by a tackle but with the loose ball squirming to the striker. He would surely have scored had the excellent Manuel Pablo not suffocated his shot at the last. A subsequent volley from outside the area, belted goalwards from Milan Baros's centre, was pawed away by Jos\u00e9 Molina. That chance hinted at better things, the result as it was of a rare flash of understanding between Ciss\u00e9 and the Czech. To watch the Merseysiders' first-choice strike pairing is to behold an anguished \"still getting to know you\" seminar, crammed with much arm waving and desperate pointing as to where the pass should have been placed. Too often they cramp each other's style, making runs into similar channels. Theirs is a work in progress which, despite hints at promise, is yet to convince. Only when one of the pair drifts wide, mimicking expensive predecessors such as Emile Heskey and El Hadji Diouf, do they threaten. Yet, even when Xabi Alonso emerged as a more potent force after half-time here, the Liverpool threat invariably lacked punch. \"I'm sure Djibril and Milan can do well together,\" insisted Ben\u00edtez. \"They played the whole 90 minutes at Fulham on Saturday and most of the game out there, and the only thing they didn't manage was to score. There is understanding developing there. They are working hard to get it right and I'm sure their rewards will come.\" While their partnership remains gummy, Liverpool will struggle to escape this group. The Golden Goal competition last night was claimed by a punter who correctly nominated the time of the first corner, such was the painful legacy of the blank scoreline. Deportivo await their first goal in the Champions League this season, but Liverpool will need to be more incisive in Spain in a fortnight if they are to edge Olympiakos out of contention. \"It was frustrating not to win, but I am happy with the way we played and the effort we put in, together with the chances we created,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"That was the best Liverpool I've seen this season - we kept the ball well, we pressed hard, we had plenty of opportunities and lots that happened out there was promising. In my opinion, we deserved to win it. But, if we play like that, we can win away from home in future.\" But two of Liverpool's last three group games will be away, where his charges have spluttered already this term, not least in Athens against Olympiakos. Should Ciss\u00e9 keep struggling to find his feet, the knock-out stage may be beyond them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
