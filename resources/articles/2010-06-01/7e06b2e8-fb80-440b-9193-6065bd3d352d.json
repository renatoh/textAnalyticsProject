After requiring only 47 sun-dappled minutes to see off Anna Chakvetadze 6-0, 6-1, on Court Two, the reigning women's champion was asked her feelings on having been dispatched to one of the outer courts. She said: \"I have mixed feelings about that. You know, I don't think I should be out there. But in a way I feel like, you know, with my popularity, it's cool to see \u2013 when I was leaving, I stayed for a whileand I signed tons of autographs. A lot of these people can't get into the Centre Court and stuff. Other than that, that definitely made up for it, to see fans I wouldn't.\" Nudged a little further on whether,as the champion, she really should have been on Centre Court or Court One she said: \"Yeah, anything like that. I don't want to get too much into that. The only way to console me was, OK, I just saw so many kids, these little girls, these little boys. \"I gave some things away. It was fun. I didn't really think about it 'cause it was really late when the schedule came out. I mean, naturally I thought: 'Well, why wasn't I on Centre or at least No1?' I guess they wanted to put Roger [Federer] and everyone else there.\" Then the shutters were pulled down. \"I'm over talking about it, so.\" What the 28-year-old was at ease discussing was her earlier meeting with the Queen, during the monarch's first visit to Wimbledon since 1977. And with humour, too. Regarding her genuflection she said: \"My bow didn't go the way I wanted. I didn't get my wrist action that I thought I would have, and then I got nervous. So my knee kind of got tight, and I felt a lot of pain in my left knee, so I couldn't get as low as I wanted to. I'm going to blame my injury. \"It was amazing to meet the Queen. I mean, it's just like history. Also to meet her at Wimbledon and then to have her come when she never comes out. It was a very, very \u2013 it was really an unbelievable moment.\" Reminded that her sister, Venus, had said Serena would beat her in a curtsy-off Williams gushed: \"Yeah, it was definitely too much hype. I feel like I had the number one curtsy and then I just got nervous. Next time I'll have to take more Advil. [a pain reliever] I definitely handle pressure way better on the court than off. No comparison.\" Her opponent can back up that assessment. Chakvetadze, a Russian ranked 118th in the world, had little answer to Williams and was lucky to avoid the dreaded double-bagel. The American, though, still believes her game can improve. She added: \"I just feel like I don't feel like I'm connecting with some shots. I'm framing some shots in practice. Obviously I feel like I played well today but mentally I just haven't felt it yet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
