Ljungberg has overseen four matches, with Arsenal keen to take their time over replacing Unai Emery, and there is little sign his services will be dispensed with in the near future. But he has not been offered any indication of the timescale over which he will occupy the position and, with the club\u2019s coaching resources severely stretched, pointed out that long-term uncertainty would not make for ideal working conditions. \u201cThe club have said I have to wait until they make a decision, so I can\u2019t do anything at the moment,\u201d he said when asked whether progress had been made in enlisting reinforcements. \u201cI have Per [Mertesacker] but at the same time he is academy manager. He is helping me with the coaching. The club has said when they make a decision then that\u2019s it \u2013 or I\u2019m leaving, obviously \u2013 and maybe then we can do something with the staff. But it\u2019s up to the club. \u201cIf you look at the person who was here before, he had a lot of staff and maybe I don\u2019t have so many. So if you keep on going like that for months and months, it\u2019s not so easy. But that\u2019s totally up to the club.\u201d Emery\u2019s staff included two first-team coaches, Juan Carlos Carcedo and Pablo Villa, along with the goalkeeping specialist Javi Garc\u00eda. They have not been replaced since his sacking a fortnight ago and it had been expected Ljungberg would be allowed to form a more defined structure than the ad-hoc arrangement with Mertesacker. He had been considering asking his former teammate Gilberto Silva to be among those involved but the club\u2019s intentions remain opaque even though they are known to be open-minded about the possibility of keeping Ljungberg on until May. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any indication of if I\u2019m here or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said to the bosses and the club is I will do everything in my power to do as well as I can for this club and the players. Then obviously it is up to them to make a decision. I try not to put any emotions into that.\u201d In the meantime Ljungberg was preparing Arsenal for the visit of Manchester City on Sunday. He revealed he had paid close attention to Pep Guardiola\u2019s career given there are similarities between their early years in coaching. Ljungberg was in charge of Arsenal\u2019s Under-23s last season while Guardiola started out in a loosely equivalent position with Barcelona B. \u201cI think he is a tremendous coach and of course I\u2019ve looked a little bit at how he did in his career,\u201d Ljungberg said. \u201cHe was with the B team with Barcelona and I thought: \u2018OK, I\u2019m an assistant and with the under-23s and the reserves here in England,\u2019 so [I have been] trying to see how he developed himself. But the ideas he comes up with, for me they have revolutionised football. It\u2019s something, as a young coach, I looked at. I\u2019m looking forward to it and I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
