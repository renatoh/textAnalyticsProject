Though they could only gain a draw at the division's bottom club last night, manager Joe Royle must have been encouraged by their second-half display in which they finally showed how they turned the Premiership upside down two seasons ago. After Bobby Zamora had punished them with a goal right on half time, Ipswich came out strongly and gained a deserved equaliser through Jim Magilton. A year ago they were playing at San Siro - which would never be mistaken for Withdean - but if they have come to terms with their reduced circumstances they can even now make a push towards the play-offs. Ipswich have been careless in their defending and wasteful in their finishing and last night they looked short of protection for their heavyweight defenders in the early stages. They were further handicapped inside the first 10 minutes when John McGreal went off injured and Matt Holland, who played in defence against Liverpool in the Worthington Cup last week, took his place in the back three. Brighton started as though they had just heard that possession futures were going through the floor, so cheaply was the ball returned to the visitors. Kerry Mayo, who sounds like an all-Ireland final, twice thumped the ball into an invisible half-forward line. Others wanted to launch the ball further. Paul Brooker, a slippery handful on the right, looked the most likely player to pull Ipswich's back three around and he provided the first coherent threat. At first he cut inside and behind Hermann Hriedarsson before picking out Zamora, whose first-time shot hit a post. Then he ran on to a Zamora nod-down to bring a full-length save out of Paul Gerrard. Darren Ambrose brought a brave blocking save out of Michel Kuipers, but Booker and Zamora were not long denied. With half-time imminent, the winger picked out the striker about 40 yards out. Zamora spun Thomas Gaardsoe around a couple of times before finding the bottom corner of the net. The Withdean enjoyed a more relaxed interval than they are used to, but it could not last. Royle changed both his strikers; Ipswich began to make better use of their extra man in midfield and Brighton were besieged. Ambrose fired wide, Richard Naylor shot straight at Kuipers and a Clapham shot bound for the top corner was tipped over. Ambrose could not be contained. In the 73rd minute his viciously struck free-kick caused chaos in the Brighton area when Kuipers failed to hold it, but Naylor's follow-up was deflected over the bar. The substitute was also prominent in the equaliser providing Jim Magilton with the chance to hit a low drive from 25 yards past Kuipers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
