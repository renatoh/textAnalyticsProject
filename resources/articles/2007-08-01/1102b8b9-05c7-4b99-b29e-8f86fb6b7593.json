Sparta Prague's captain, known to English fans from his time at West Ham, is the archetypal hard man. A wall of muscle and latent menace, he is a byword for \"uncompromising\". Yet there he was, in the final Champions League qualifying round against Arsenal, fighting a losing battle to prevent his legs from giving way. Repka had been sorted out by the unlikeliest of enforcers and Cesc F\u00e1bregas, the Arsenal playmaker, struggled to suppress his pride. \"It's true that maybe I was a bit late but you know, he [Repka] did the same before,\" said F\u00e1bregas, eyes twinkling. \"Sometimes you need to do this kind of thing. Not with bad intentions, of course - I thought I could win the ball - but sometimes when you cannot play because they are physically very strong, you have to go for [the] physical game as well. I think this is football. Sometimes it happens to you, sometimes it happens [to others] . . . and of course, I am sorry.\" Arsenal's players had been upset to hear Repka, in the countdown to the first leg, promise to leave his mark on them. After two minutes he cut through Robin van Persie, the Arsenal striker, from behind. And there were more full-blooded challenges from Sparta players before Repka went nose to nose in confrontation with Alex Hleb. Something had to be done and moments later Repka was in a heap. The Spaniard shrugged off the yellow card he received as Repka attempted to shrug off the pain as it coursed through his leg. He regained his feet and tried to carry on but when he next picked up possession he slowly crumpled to the ground. After treatment he determined to betray no sign of weakness. Insults flew. F\u00e1bregas even felt emboldened enough to mimic Repka's limp but, on 37 minutes, the Sparta central defender was forced, begrudgingly, to admit defeat. The Arsenal man then blocked Repka's path as he was substituted and the pair had their final exchange. F\u00e1bregas, however, had already made the significant statement. \"Maybe he [Repka] thinks this is the way to play against Arsenal but this year we're ready to show everyone that we're not the same team as before,\" said Ga\u00ebl Clichy, the Arsenal left-back. \"We're ready for the challenge and we'll wait for the others to come. We play against teams like this in England every weekend. We believe we have football quality and physical quality. We showed it in Prague and we will show it again on Sunday [at Blackburn]. \"It was nice to see Cesc get in there; that showed the spirit you're going to see from us this year. People have been saying it's not his game to play like that but he's showed he can score, he can pass and he can kick people, so everything is perfect.\" Arsenal have acquired an unwanted reputation as a soft touch, principally away from home, where they have been bullied out of their stride. The suspicion persists that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the manager, has handed the club captaincy to William Gallas because the France defender has attitude. Gilberto Silva, vice-captain last season and this, is a more laid-back character. F\u00e1bregas, too, has what it takes to shake things up and he has shown himself to be no respecter of reputations. He jabbed his finger angrily at Mark Hughes, the Blackburn manager, last season after the goalless FA Cup tie at Emirates, telling him that a man who had once played for Barcelona should be ashamed of the suffocating tactics he employed. The Spain international, who started at the Barcelona youth academy, was told to apologise. The 20-year-old had also grappled with Frank Lampard, the Chelsea midfielder, in the m\u00eal\u00e9e that disfigured the Carling Cup final in February and he was accused of playing a prominent part in the Battle of the Buffet that followed Arsenal's defeat at Manchester United in October 2004 which ended their 49-game unbeaten Premiership run. Indeed, he is alleged to have been the phantom flan flinger. F\u00e1bregas is coming to be viewed as an upstart in some quarters but he is developing broad shoulders. The jeers he heard from the Sparta crowd did not faze him and he went on to score the opening goal in Arsenal's 2-0 win. \"I heard what Repka said and it's not good for football to say before the game, 'I will kick their players',\" he said later. \"If we hear this, we will be ready for it.\" F\u00e1bregas hopes that Repka will have recovered in time for the return leg on Wednesday week. He will not run from anyone.
