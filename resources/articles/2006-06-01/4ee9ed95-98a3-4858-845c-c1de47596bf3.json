Newly-merged strategic health authorities are about to come into being, but their chief executives barely have their feet under their new desks. Primary care trusts are also merging. Sir Ian Carruthers himself is a caretaker until a new chief executive is appointed. Yet time is short to reform the NHS before budget growth slows in 2008. So, how can the NHS avoid system paralysis? Sir Ian: \"There is an urgent timetable, you are right. The action we need to take is challenging - probably among the most challenging in the history of the NHS - because we have to maintain the excellent results that we published in our annual report ... and we need to meet the challenge of the deficits.\" He said people should keep the size of the deficit in perspective and appreciate that the Department of Health has set a target for returning the NHS to net balance this year. \"I think the picture you paint is really demanding - and on top of that we need to take forward and accelerate the healthcare reform programme. Much of that we will publish in the summer on issues such as the way forward on regulation, commissioning and provider reform. That is a really challenging agenda in anybody's book. And yes, I am in an acting position. \"I haven't time to think whether I am acting or not. All I am interested in is delivering that agenda.\" Did he really believe in the strategic health authority/primary care trust mergers? Was there real benefit from the disruption at this crucial time? \"I very much support the direction of travel: the creation of larger PCTs; establishing a plurality of providers; involvement of the independent sector; and the creation of foundation trusts with different incentives and a stronger voice. All these are entirely the right ingredients. \"I'm keen to do that. It is right for the patients and for the NHS. But at the end of the day it is the quality of people who make a difference in any system ... Organisational models are important because they enable certain things, but it is people in the end who will make a difference. It is important that we get as many top quality people as possible in these posts.\" That answer did not defend merger of the strategic health authorities. Did he think that was an unnecessary distraction? \"I would think we could have approached this in a more evolutionary way, but the direction of travel is right. I am totally committed to making things happen. Larger strategic health authorities will bring benefits in terms of linking with regional government to take forward health improvement and some of the strategic challenges in the NHS.\" Can every part of the NHS be returned to financial health? \"Do I believe that every system can make the change? Unequivocally, yes. It will take some time in many areas. The context of every area is different. \"In some areas, you will need significant restructuring and service reconfiguration to get to that point. You are dealing with a lot of historical decisions that are either helping or hindering you. But the job of leadership is managing the context you are in. There is no reason why the problem we have got now cannot be addressed. \"People should now have the feeling when they come with these difficult issues that support is there. From the prime minister downwards, we are all saying it is there. We now need to demonstrate it is as well. \"I don't believe there is anywhere that can't be put right, but in many places there are great challenges.\" Will the reconfigurations require closure of entire district general hospitals? \"I don't know the whole of the country. People will need to look for local solutions. But there will be major change in all district general hospitals. That is inescapable because of the direction of travel in the white paper. \"I can think of very few instances where we are talking about closing whole hospitals. You never say never, but I can think of very few where that would be the case. \"The first task of the new strategic health authority chief executives will be to finalise local development plans in which they will identify service reconfigurations. We (at the DoH) should be in a position later this year to take decisions and make them public.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
