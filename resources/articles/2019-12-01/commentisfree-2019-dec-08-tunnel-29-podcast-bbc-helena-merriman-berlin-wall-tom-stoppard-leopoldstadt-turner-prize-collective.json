This 10-part story about the digging of a tunnel under the Berlin Wall in 1961 to help people escape from the east to the west has so far garnered more than 3 million listeners. Admittedly it has been plugged hugely on Radio 4 (where the series also ran in late October) and even on BBC TV, but Tunnel 29 is nonetheless a truly exciting yarn. It has worked too because its writer/presenter, Helena Merriman, was given a free hand to report in a more informal style, without losing any authoritative air. Her podcast\u2019s immersive approach, coupled with atmospheric music, creates a sense for the listener of being right there in the tunnel, experiencing the dangers. This style is something that Radio 4\u2019s controller, Mohit Bakaya, appointed in July, tells me he wants to replicate on the network, where appropriate. The station has both an ageing and a declining audience, and Bakaya is alarmed that many young people not only do not listen, but are often unaware of the network and its programmes. The hope is that podcasts can draw a new audience to Radio 4 itself. Tom Stoppard\u2019s next play, Leopoldstadt, has just begun rehearsals for its West End premiere on 12 February at Wyndham\u2019s theatre. The playwright\u2019s most personal work, Leopoldstadt is also a gamble for Stoppard, since nearly all his plays have opened in subsidised venues - very often at the National. His last drama there, The Hard Problem in 2015, disappointed; the writer was wounded. But 18 months later a terrific revival of Travesties (1974) at London\u2019s Menier Chocolate Factory, followed by its West End transfer, reinvigorated him. Patrick Marber directed that production, and will direct Stoppard\u2019s new drama. While not autobiographical as such, Leopoldstadt, named after the one-time Jewish quarter of Vienna, tells of how the city buzzed with intellectual and creative life in the early 20th century, before the persecution started. The play reflects Stoppard\u2019s own background. His grandparents died in concentration camps, though the toddler Stoppard (then Tom\u00e1\u0161 Straussler) had escaped the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, fleeing with his parents to Singapore and then India, before reaching England in 1946. Even with no stars in its ensemble cast of nearly 30 adults and five children, and without the safety net of a publicly funded theatre, Leopoldstadt\u2019s arrival at Wyndham\u2019s is already paying off, with the initial booking period extended until mid-June. At 82, this could conceivably be Stoppard\u2019s last bow. Hopefully, a triumphant one. The Turner prize, withering on the vine for the past 10 years (can you name a winner from the past decade?), got its 15 minutes of woke fame last Tuesday night when the judges agreed to the four shortlisted artists\u2019 request that the award should be shared. A daft cop-out, which enabled the jury not to have to pick a winner from this dreary exhibition. The Turner prize, which has given us great winners such as Antony Gormley, Steve McQueen and Grayson Perry, should now be put out of its misery.
