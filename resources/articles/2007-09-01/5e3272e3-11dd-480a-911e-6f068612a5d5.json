The deal marks the end of a four-year standoff between Mr Simon and the activist hedge fund Polygon, which has blocked previous attempts to delist the business. Mr Simon, who with his family owns 75.5% of the firm, is offering minority shareholders 424p a share - a 4% premium to Thursday's closing price of 407.5p. He is paying \u00a3185m for the stake he doesn't already own. The shares closed up 7\u00bdp yesterday at 415p. Mr Simon started the business in 1973 as a stall selling hippy clothes on London's Portobello Road and took it public in 1998. He has tried several times to take the business off the stock market but was thwarted by Polygon. The US fund, which controls about 11% of Monsoon, has now accepted Mr Simon's offer. The board has recommended the offer, which will be put to shareholders at a meeting in November. The news came as Monsoon said trading had remained \"very poor\" over the summer. Like-for-like sales plunged 9% in the 17 weeks to September 22. \"The outlook in the run-up to the important Christmas period remains challenging,\" it said. Profits fell sharply in the year to May, despite Liz Hurley fronting its ad campaign. The 858-strong chain has been hit by higher interest rates, wet weather and fierce competition on the high street. Monsoon's signature flowery, boho-style look has also run against fashion trends. Monsoon has hired Helena Christensen to be its new face and design a \"green\" range. The German model Heidi Klum was signed up to front the group's Accessorize chain, following on from Lily Cole. Mr Simon, 58, has been running the business since the chief executive, Rose Foster, left in March to head the lingerie chain La Senza. He warned there would be \"no quick fixes\" for Monsoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
