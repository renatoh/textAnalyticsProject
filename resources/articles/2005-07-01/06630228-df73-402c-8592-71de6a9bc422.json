The legal document setting up the trust and detailing the assets that would be made available was due to be signed on Thursday. However Eric McDonald, the trade union representative on the three-strong team of trustees said that Phoenix Venture Holdings - MG Rover's parent company and the owner of the promised assets - had said the handover could not go ahead. \"They phoned to say that as a result of the Department of Trade and Industry inquiry they had received legal advice not to hand over any assets relating to PVH until the inquiry had been concluded.\" Mr McDonald said the trustees, who also include the Bishop of Birmingham and community activist Carl Chinn, were very disappointed by the decision and wanted to see the legal advice on which the decision not to hand over the assets, which have been valued at between \u00a310m and \u00a330m, had been based. He queried why the DTI inquiry, which was looking into events at the whole group, should make it necessary to hold up the transfer of assets to the fund which had been set up to help the 6,100 workers who lost their jobs when MG Rover went into administration in April. He was critical of PVH chairman John Towers who, he said, had been quick to promise help for the workforce. \"In the early days he was saying he wanted to do as much as he could for the workers who had supported him.\" No one from PVH could be contacted for comment yesterday. Among the assets which had been promised to the fund was Studley Castle, a hotel and conference centre which is up for sale and which is expected to fetch around \u00a35m. Administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers are still considering a number of bids for all or parts of MG Rover. Mr McDonald, a full time official with the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union, said: \"From our point of view we want an outcome which supports the largest number of jobs at Longbridge.\" Though at least one approach envisages restarting production at Longbridge, others are simply to \"lift and shift\" assets. \"That's no help to us,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
