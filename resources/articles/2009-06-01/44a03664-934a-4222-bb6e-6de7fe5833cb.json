Analysts believe the proposals \u2013 which include using \u00a3200m from the BBC licence fee and adding a 50p-a-month fee on fixed lines to invest in broadband \u2013 will help the company fund the expansion of its next-generation network. There is a growing feeling in the City that BT may be turning the corner after a difficult time and that, as its cashflow grows, so will dividends. On that basis, analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their recommendation from equal weight to overweight, and their price target from 130p to 150p. The bank said: \"With management now focused on cash generation, we think free cash flow could rise from \u00a31.15bn in 2010 to \u00a31.5bn in 2013, and long term it could be \u00a31.9bn or higher. The dividend could therefore grow strongly again.\" Morgan Stanley's optimism follows a buy note on Friday from BT's joint broker Merrill Lynch that set a 130p target. BT closed 7.6p higher at 102.5p. With the rival distraction of Royal Ascot, the rest of the market struggled for direction, with the FTSE 100 closing only 2.56 points higher at 4328.57. UK inflation figures came in slightly higher than expected but in the US the picture was more mixed. Producer prices slipped by 0.1% and industrial production fell by 1.1%, but there was positive housing data. In Britain, a 25-year syndicated gilt auction went well, with the size raised from \u00a33bn-\u00a35bn to \u00a37bn to meet demand. Most of the miners remained under pressure, with Rio Tinto falling 71p to \u00a328.29 after expressing caution about the outlook as it issued the prospectus for its $15.2bn rights issue. But Xstrata added 10.5p to 716.5p as talk of a possible link with Anglo American, 124p lower at \u00a316.79, refused to die down. Tesco climbed 5.5p to 361.6p after reporting its best quarterly UK sales rise for two years. J Sainsbury added 3.5p to 331.75p before today's trading statement. Home Retail Group, the Argos and Homebase owner, added 4.25p to 262p as analysts at HSBC lifted their price target from 195p to 285p and their rating from underweight to neutral. But Kesa Electricals closed 3.5p lower at 116.5p after announcing it was close to selling its loss-making Swiss business. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
