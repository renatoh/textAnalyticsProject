McCoist has understandably stopped short of speaking about it publicly, but his hopes and plans of reclaiming the Scottish Premier League title have surely been blunted by fiscal reality. As a batch of trialists have come and gone from Rangers' Murray Park training complex \u2013 in certain cases, after only one day \u2013 scepticism has been rife. McCoist was unable to offer a contract to a free agent from Estonia simply on the basis there was not a spare wage. McCoist's hopes have seemed intrinsically linked to the future of one of his key players, Nikica Jelavic. While the striker's sale would unquestionably hinder Rangers on the pitch, a salary saving would allow McCoist at least some leeway. A key question amid what is, surely, an unsatisfactory situation is whether McCoist is more culpable in this current scenario than the Rangers owner, Craig Whyte. Those who criticise the manager point out that three players \u2013 Matt McKay, Alejandro Bedoya and Juan Ortiz \u2013 were brought in during the last transfer window and have subsequently made little or no impact at all. An extension of this scrutiny is that Rangers' first-team scouting operation, headed by their former players Neil Murray and John Brown, may not be up to standard. \"We could sit here and give each other 20 players over the last two years who have come to the Old Firm and it hasn't worked out,\" McCoist explains. \"We have got a fantastic scouting set-up. Neil and John are top class in my opinion. \"They have given me nothing but fantastic support and help and that'll continue. I know that people will question the signings that don't come into the team and do well. That's part of the business, that's fine, but I'm realistic [enough] to know that every signing is not going to be a success.\" With good reason, McCoist points to the impact of the defensive players he also recruited around the start of the season. \"We had to replace players in the team,\" he says. \"Equally, we had to replace players in the squad. Simple as that. I think we brought in seven players. You wouldn't think I'd be signing seven players to go into my team. \"You maybe sign four that you hope to get into your team. We had to replace players who we had on loan last year and they weren't playing every week. So we have replaced them, you could argue, with players roughly in the same boat.\" With a championship at stake, and Celtic moving to overturn a 15-point advantage Rangers held at one stage, the importance of a fraught situation off the field can be lost. Especially, that is, by supporters who crave success. \"The ones who sit back and take a look at the whole picture will definitely understand the economics of the situation,\" McCoist adds. \"The club has been downsizing for a number of years now and still managed to win the title. The situation we are in now is certainly as difficult but I still believe we will win the title, absolutely.\" El Hadji-Diouf was the most high\u2011profile arrival at Ibrox a year ago. Despite the controversial striker not featuring week on week for Rangers in those closing months of the season, McCoist recalls the significance of January transfer moves. \"Absolutely massive. It might sound crazy because they didn't play an awful lot but I just think the influence they had was massive,\" the manager insists. \"I thought we did some great business there. I'm not saying we wouldn't have won the title but it really, really helped us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
