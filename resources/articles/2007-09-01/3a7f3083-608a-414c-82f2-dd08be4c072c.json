Victory by at least a two-goal margin is needed to guarantee Hope Powell's team a place in the quarter-finals. Aluko was left out of Friday's meeting with Germany, a game that ended in a gutsy goalless draw against the world champions, after failing to find the target in Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Japan. But the England coach likely to name a pacey front line against Argentina's static defence, which was cut to shreds in an 11-0 thrashing by the Germans before losing 1-0 to Japan, so Aluko, the quickest forward in the squad, is set for a recall. The 20-year-old former Charlton Athletic player, a law student at Brunel University, will have no fear of failure despite heading into England's biggest game since the 1995 World Cup finals with a record of only four goals in 24 internationals. \"You have to have a positive approach,\" said Aluko. \"As a striker you visualise yourself scoring goals. If I was put in the same positions I had last week I'd feel very confident, and hopefully I'd put the ball away.\" The Arsenal winger Rachel Yankey, a second-half substitute against the Germans, is also likely to return. Positional changes will also be made as Powell, whose tactics worked to near-perfection on Friday, looks to use her squad to best effect. Aluko said: \"It's not just about the starting places, it's about the squad, especially when you have three games in seven days. There is good competition for places and you need a tournament strategy.\" Powell's has been honed through her team's appearances at the 2001 and 2005 European Championships, at neither of which did England progress beyond the group stage. As she looked ahead to the prospect of finally leading her team into the last eight of a major tournament, Powell said: \"Getting out of the group was our first aim and we've put ourselves in a good position, but we can't underestimate Argentina. Pace will be a factor against them, but the most important thing will be to keep the ball moving and not give it away cheaply.\" The Group A fixtures will be completed when Germany take on Japan in Hangzhou today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
