With Ennis likely to be vying for December's BBC Sports Personality of the Year, her coach since the age of 11 has beaten her to recognition in the slew of end-of -year awards likely to honour Team GB's Olympians. Minichiello has coached Ennis since the mid-1990s. He was formerly the national event coach for combined events and switched roles in 2010 to become a UK Athletics Olympic coach, allowing him to focus exclusively on Ennis. The Sheffield-born heptathlete, who won gold at the world championships in 2009, recently revealed that she and Minichiello had resisted pressure from Charles van Commenee, then UK Athletics head coach, to move to London to train ahead of the Games. In London, she won gold with a British points record total of 6,955 on \"Super Saturday\" in the Olympic Stadium. At the awards, organised by the national coaching organisation, SportsCoachUK, and presented by the Princess Royal, the accolade of High Performance Coach of the Year was shared among several recipients to reflect the success of the London Games. Minichiello was one, as were the new UK Athletics head coach, Peter Eriksson, (previously head coach for Paralympics GB track and field athletes) and the women's endurance track cycling coach, Paul Manning. Rory McIlroy's coach, Michael Bannon, also won a prize. Every coach of a London 2012 gold medallist was rewarded with induction into the Coaching Hall of Fame. The coaches of Alastair and Jonathan Brownlee won the Coaching Chain: Appreciation of Coaching Award that recognises coaches who have helped athletes along the way to elite success. The awards went to Tony Kingham and Charles Lines who encouraged and developed the brothers' running and triathlon at Bradford Grammar School, Corrinne Tantrum who provided tailored swimming training for the duo at City of Bradford Swimming Club, and Malcolm Brown and Jack Maitland who coached the brothers to their Olympic medals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
