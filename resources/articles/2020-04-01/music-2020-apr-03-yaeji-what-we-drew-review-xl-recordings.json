She broke through with her squelchy house track Raingurl in 2017, contrasting a bold bassline with deadpan vocals about her glasses fogging up in the club. On her new mixtape, her first release for XL Recordings, Lee digs even further into her interior landscape, with diaristic, spacious house music on which she sings about subjects like the difficulty of getting out of bed (on the glimmering lead single Waking Up Down). As we enter a nightclub-less era of isolation, she\u2019s timed it eerily well: this is dance music to soundtrack \u2013 and soothe \u2013 an existential crisis. At a slower tempo than her more well-known club tracks, this album foregrounds Lee\u2019s vocals, and straddles a blurry line between dream pop and DIY dance music. Occasionally, it\u2019s a sombre listen. On the cavernous In Place \uadf8 \uc790\ub9ac \uadf8\ub300\ub85c, Lee\u2019s Korean vocals drift perilously over a nightmarish rolling bass before her voice is pitch-shifted to a low, demonic drone. In the Mirror \uac70\uc6b8 is another example of Lee using her vocal to creepy effect, as it echoes ominously over sinister bass, while The Th1ng (featuring London-based drag performance artist Victoria Sin and producer Shy One) matches philosophical spoken word with writhing, distorted electronics. Mostly, though, Lee counterbalances her darker experiments with playfulness and hope. Her genre-fluidity creates moments of unexpected beauty, such as the improvisational jazz flutters of These Days \uc694\uc998 , and the verse from Brooklyn rapper Nappy Nina on the off-the-wall dance highlight Money Can\u2019t Buy. Lee is at her strongest by far when balancing her bubbly, light melodic touch with more poignant elements, as she does on the synth-led closing track Never Settling Down. It\u2019s a commitment-avoidant twentysomething\u2019s anthem on which she sings alongside distant drum breaks: \u201cI\u2019m never settling down / I\u2019m never touching ground /... Never having to admit that I swallow my feelings.\u201d Moments of startling emotional clarity like that prove Yaeji isn\u2019t just a club producer but a songwriter whose impact can be felt far beyond the dancefloor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
