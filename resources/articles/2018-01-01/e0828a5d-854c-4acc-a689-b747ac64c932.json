Jaynesh Chudasama, 28 has been charged with three counts of causing death by dangerous driving and will appear in custody at Uxbridge magistrates court on Monday. A second man, who was sought by police investigating the fatal collision, was arrested earlier on Sunday after handing himself in at a police station, the Metropolitan police said. Earlier on Sunday police released CCTV images of a man in connection with the collision in west London on Friday night. After the second man was arrested the Met released a statement saying the 34-year-old man had voluntarily attended a north London police station on Sunday. \u201cHe has now been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and taken into custody for questioning,\u201d the statement said. Investigators earlier said the 28-year-old was arrested on Friday following the incident. The three victims have been named by police as Harry Rice, 17, George Wilkinson, 16, and Josh Mcgunniess, 16, although formal identification has yet to be completed. Despite the efforts of paramedics, all three boys were pronounced dead at the scene. It is understood that they had been on their way to a birthday party at a nearby football club with friends when they were killed. Harry was a talented footballer, and Farnborough Town FC, where he had played with the academy until recently, paid tribute to him in a tweet. The victims were with a group of friends walking towards the Goals five-a-side football club at about 8.40pm when they were hit. The collision occurred close to the Esso garage near junction 4 of the M4. The stretch of road in Hayes where the crash happened is now lined with hundreds of bunches of flowers, many left by teenage friends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
