His 104 eased Surrey back into the game and prompted his cricket manager Keith Medlycott to reflect on matters further up the M23. \"I don't think there is anybody in the country who seriously thinks Mark Ramprakash is suddenly an average player, that he is washed up or that he could not get selected for England again,\" he said. \"He is a high-quality player and anybody who watched his innings would acknowledge he is someone with the class to play at the top level.\" The England selectors are already mulling over the recall of one Surrey batsman - Graham Thorpe, not considered for Lord's because of a weekend back spasm - but whether they will want to consider a second is doubtful. However, Ramprakash and the Surrey tail have thrown the onus in this game back on Sussex. To win it they need to score quickly and then bowl out Surrey on a wicket still playing well. When they accepted the offer of bad light 28 overs into their second innings it smacked of a side more worried about losing. Ramprakash's innings lasted five hours and was his fourth championship hundred of the season. He also passed 1,000 runs in a year for the 13th time. But statistics are unimportant. By sticking around when others had gone cheaply, he was there to inspire the last four Surrey wickets to an extra 229 runs. From 126 for six and a near-certain follow-on, Surrey finished only 74 short of Sussex. Not even the two wickets in three balls that fell to Mushtaq Ahmed at the start of play could ruffle Ramprakash. When he hooked Paul Hutchison through fine-leg's hands for four to reach 101 it was his first boundary of the day and the first chance he had given. Martin Bicknell (42) and Ian Salisbury (one) were the two that went quickly, bringing Saqlain Mushtaq to the wicket at 217 for eight. Seventy-five minutes and three sixes later Saqlain had cruised past his fifty, Surrey had 300 on the board and the threat of a follow-on had long gone. Saqlain warmed up with a couple of straight fours and a few edges but, when Hutchison replaced James Kirtley, the Pakistani spinner unveiled the Saqlain slap - a shot which initially resembled a cut but flat-batted the ball into the crowd at straight mid-off. Saqlain then lifted Mushtaq over long-on twice in three balls. That second six took Surrey past the follow-on mark, but just to make sure the \"slap\" was unfurled again to clout Hutchison straight for four, although the fans beyond the boundary claimed it had cleared the ropes. By the time he was out, the last wicket to fall, Saqlain was on 68, one short of his best score of the season. Before then Ramprakash had fallen to Kirtley's first delivery with the new ball, to which he got the finest of tickles. Their partnership was worth 84 in 20 overs - 57 to Saqlain, who then added 54 for the last wicket with Jimmy Ormond. Ormond's 42 off 41 balls included eight fours and if that had further undermined Sussex's championship aspirations worse was to follow. Richard Montgomerie, a hero of their first innings with 90, was lbw to Bicknell for two in the third over and Tony Cottey (41) spooned a pull to Ramprakash at square leg before Sussex unaccountably accepted the offer and trudged off in poor(ish) light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
