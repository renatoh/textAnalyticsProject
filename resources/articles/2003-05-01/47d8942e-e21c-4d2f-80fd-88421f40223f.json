Children who otherwise feel confident and secure can cope; those with fears closer to home may become overwhelmed. It sounds to me as though it's not going to school that frightens your son, but leaving you, and I wonder whether there are issues here you have tried to sweep under the carpet. You mention in your letter that there have been some problems at home. What is he scared will happen when his back is turned? Raised voices? Anger? Someone leaving? You should never assume you can keep marital problems secret from kids or that pretending all is well will allay their fears. Rather than blaming the school, if there has been an upset at home you need to discuss it with him so he can see that you take his fears seriously, are prepared to be honest with him and help him feel more in control of his own world. Parentline Plus helpline: 0808 800 2222 Jean Robb, Successful Learning Your son is evidently a sensitive, intelligent child. The best thing you can do is help him to understand that not everything can go right all the time, and help him to cope when he has a bad day or a bad week. If he is proficient at dealing with bad things as well as good on a personal level, he will be gaining strength to live his life rather than thinking that somehow life should be perfect and other people are having a better time than he is. Yes, things do go wrong, but you could point out that this has happened throughout history and the world is still here. You could use the example of the family microcosm: families, too, go through bad times, but these can be resolved. For adults, too, the world can be a confusing and uncertain place, and he doesn't have to feel depressed if he can't make sense of everything. I wonder if he also thinks his parents are only interested in him if he has \"problems\"? Many parents fall into the trap of thinking parenting is only about helping when things go wrong, but it is also about helping with everyday coping strategies.

Jean Robb is co-author with Hilary Letts of Creating Motivated Kids (Hodder &amp; Stoughton \u00a36.99) Sarah Lawson, author of Helping Children Get The Most From School At this age, children are just beginning to realise how intractable some of the world's problems are. We can't pretend that these problems don't exist - this will simply convince them that the situation is so bad that even their parents can't bear to contemplate it. We can, however, balance the \"doom and gloom\" with reassurance that we can all help to solve these problems, in small ways such as recycling and energy efficiency and, on a larger scale, by influencing political decisions. I hope your son's school has taken this approach, but unfortunately not all teachers are sensitive to the effects that their words might have. I recently heard from the mother of a nine-year-old whose brother, a soldier, had just departed for Iraq. Her headteacher finished the following day's assembly with: \"And now we will all pray that Rosie's brother comes back safely from the war.\" Needless to say, this simply served to convince an already anxious child that there was even more to worry about than she thought! I don't think his school's talk of war and environmental deterioration alone could have caused your son's present insecurity, however. Children can and do become depressed, and he may need professional help to identify and explore the issues that underlie his present unhappiness, which could include family conflict, relationships with classmates or problems with schoolwork itself. If you have not done so already, it would be a good idea to ask his teacher whether she has noticed anything that might be relevant.
