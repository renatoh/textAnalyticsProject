The Mirror also has a picture of an empty drive-through testing station in Chessington, Surrey to emphasise its point \u2013 an image also used across the width of the Times\u2019 front page under the headline \u201cVirus testing plans in chaos\u201d. The Mail focuses on the \u201cstatistic that humbles ministers\u201d with the headline \u201c550,000 NHS staff only 2,000 tested\u201d, in what it calls the \u201clatest shocking example of our testing scandal\u201d. It goes on to claim that its reporting has \u201cfinally\u201d stung Boris Johnson into action, and quotes the prime minister as promising to \u201cmassively increase\u201d testing. There\u2019s a similar line on the front of the i \u2013 \u201cNHS frontline staff let down on testing\u201d \u2013 and the Metro \u2013 \u201cRidiculous\u201d. The Guardian has the story about the 2,000 NHS tests on its front page but prefers to lead with a different angle: \u201cVirus patients more likely to die may have ventilators taken away\u201d, looking at the terrible dilemma being faced by medical staff who may have to decide which people should be kept on the critical machines. The Telegraph also wonders about the testing disaster with the headline \u201cQuestions without answers\u201d over a picture of the business secretary, Alok Sharma, at Wednesday\u2019s Downing Street media briefing. The paper \u2013 which has carried many front page pictures of Johnson portraying his policy in a positive light \u2013 says the government was unable to explain why its testing strategy was failing, why so few NHS staff had been tested and how it was going to manage an exit from the lockdown. The Express also spares the prime minister any direct blame, instead deflecting fire on to the banks which it says must step up to help the economy in return for being bailed out in 2008: \u201cWe bailed you out now do your duty\u201d. The Sun just has the words \u201cClap of honour\u201d on its front page in a clarion call for readers to support Thursday night\u2019s nationwide ovation for NHS staff. The FT reports on the damage to the economy and says \u201cJobless claims rocket by 1m as virus delivers shock to economy\u201d. The Scotsman is also concerned about the economy, but chiefly that of Edinburgh: \u201cFestival cancellation will be \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for business\u201d, its headline reads."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
