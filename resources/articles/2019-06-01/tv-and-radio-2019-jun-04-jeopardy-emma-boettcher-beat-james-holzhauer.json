Owing to the taping schedule of the program, none of the episodes of Holzhauer\u2019s near historic and widely followed streak had aired when the University of Chicago librarian faced off against him in March, so his 32-day run and $2.46m in winnings were news to her. Before the taping, a producer mentioned the details of her formidable opponent\u2019s winnings, she told the Chicago Tribune. \u201c\u2018This is James. He\u2019s won 32 games. He\u2019s won, however, many million dollars,\u2019\u201d they told 27-year-old Boettcher. \u201cSo that was the first time I had heard of him. Those numbers, I heard them, and I thought, \u2018That\u2019s not real, what\u2019s the real number?\u2019 And the real number never came because that was the real number, so I went into denial pretty early on.\u201d Luckily Boettcher had been preparing for the occasion for much of her life. A paper she wrote to finish her master\u2019s degree in information science at University of North Carolina was on Jeopardy itself, she told the New York Times. She analyzed thousands of clues from the show over the years to figure out whether or not a computer could use the length or types of words to ascertain the difficulty level. (Yes, as she found). In the meantime she had also been practicing at home, and meticulously documenting patterns and tendencies she noticed while watching the show. As Final Jeopardy \u2013 the last round \u2013 approached, the librarian was ahead of Holzhauer, the professional gambler, by $3,200. Having written an undergraduate thesis on Shakespeare, the final clue was right in her wheelhouse: \u201cThe line \u2018a great reckoning in a little room\u2019 in As You Like It is usually taken to refer to this author\u2019s premature death,\u201d host Alex Trebeck said. Both contestants guessed the answer correctly, Christopher \u201cKit\u201d Marlowe, but it was Boettcher that gambled big, wagering $20,201 to his $1,399. \u201cWhen I got the call to be on the show, I really wanted to hold my own,\u201d she told Vulture. \u201cI wanted to be able to say I got onstage and I was able to put this lifelong love of trivia to good use. It didn\u2019t necessarily mean I would win \u2013 there\u2019s skill and luck involved in every game. I wanted to do right by that love of Jeopardy!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
