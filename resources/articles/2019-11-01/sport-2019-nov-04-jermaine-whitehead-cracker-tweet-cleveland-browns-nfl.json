Dustin Fox, a former NFL player who now works for Browns radio, called Whitehead\u2019s tackling during the team\u2019s loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday a \u201cjoke\u201d. Whitehead was also the subject of criticism from fans on Twitter. Whitehead used a racial slur in response to Fox\u2019s comments on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m out there with a broke hand.. don\u2019t get smoked fuck ass cracker,\u201d he wrote. He also threatened another user on Twitter, writing: \u201cImma kill you bitch\u201d. Whitehead\u2019s account was suspended shortly afterwards but he continued to vent his anger on Instagram, threatening another user. On Sunday night, a Browns spokesperson told ESPN that Whitehead\u2019s comments were \u201ctotally unacceptable and highly inappropriate\u201d. On Monday morning they waived him. The 26-year-old was in his second season with the Browns. He previously played for the Green Bay Packers, who released him after he was ejected for slapping an opponent. The incident was another bump in a disappointing season for the Browns. They were widely tipped to contend in the AFC North after missing the playoffs for the previous 16 seasons. Instead, the loss to the Broncos left the team with a 2-6 record and little hope of reaching the postseason."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
