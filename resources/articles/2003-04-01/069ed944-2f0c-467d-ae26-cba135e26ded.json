Off picking winners that is, mind you YBYLers were never really 'on' picking winners in the first place. So, the Grand National cometh, the Grand National provideth and yes, like clockwork, the Grand National taketh-away your money. It may well be the most popular, most famous race in the history of horse racing, but it sure ain't one to be betting on with any degree of seriousness. It's not unlike the lottery really - forty horses, umpteen fences and very little chance of winning it. That is unless you're me. Yes, I won on the National through the trusty old office sweepstake. My \u00a32 ticket returned \u00a350, so you could say I got odds of 24-1 on what ended up as a 16-1 winner. I'd say that's value. This week some of you chose to be tempted by the big race and I don't blame you - it is hard not to be. And when I say 'big race' Mr Rookwood, I am not referring to the Toffs v Hoorays boat race which you successfully managed to swindle another winner from. There were four bets on the Grand National - one from each team. Stephen Cunningham went for Gingembre who, according to Blue Square's managing director should have won the race - purely for the fact that he (the MD, not the horse) has won the last two office sweepstakes on the race and he also drew Gingembre this year. Little did he know that he was handing over the title of Office Sweepstakes King to none other than Mr Urquhart. Simon Morehen picked Ad Hoc, a well-fancied nag, but one that failed to finish. Geoff Naylor picked 40-1 outsider Youragoodun, who predictably failed to live up to his name, while Sean Ingle chose Maximise and certainly did that to his losses by placing a whopping \u00a38 each-way bet on the horse. So, what criteria should one look for in a Grand National horse? Well, there are all sorts of tried and untested methods which range from careful studying of the form guide to choosing a name you like the sound of, but what I tend to do is narrow the field down to horses priced between 14-1 and 33-1. A large number of horses tend to win with odds in this range and such prices also make each-way bets worthwhile. Beyond that it's mostly down to luck and this is probably why most serious punters give the race a complete body swerve. Among the rest of the bets this week a couple of people chose to bet on Ralf Schumacher each-way in the Brazilian Grand Farce and the rest stuck to football. Only Tom Lines managed a winning bet by backing Portsmouth to beat Walsall. One day, maybe not next week and maybe not even the week after that, but someday not-so-soon for the rest of my life, we'll have a week full of winners.
