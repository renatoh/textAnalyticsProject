It was Saturday 16 March 2013, the last weekend of the Six Nations, and England were playing Wales in Cardiff. England had won four Tests straight, so the grand slam was on the line. Thomas had not played a rugby union Test for six years, but after playing 103 of them he knew as well as anyone what it took to win the big games. And as he watched England warm up, he could see they didn\u2019t have it. \u201cI looked at England\u2019s so-called match-winners, like Owen Farrell, and saw a bunch of boys,\u201d he wrote later. \u201cTheir game faces were on, but I saw something else in their eyes, they weren\u2019t prepared.\u201d England lost, 30-3. Six years, seven months later, and it is the World Cup semi-final at the International Stadium in Yokohama. The All Blacks, back-to-back world champions, have gathered into a pyramid to start the haka. In response, England have split into a V, two diagonal lines of 11 leading back to Farrell, their captain, at the centre. The camera cut to him standing, hands on hips. And what did we see in his eyes then, as the director moved in for a close-up, but a man who knew, who felt, with complete and utter confidence that he and his team were ready for what was in front of them. You could have a good conversation with Farrell about leadership. Last year he wrote a 12,000 word dissertation on reflective learning as part of his degree course in management and leadership. But you won\u2019t get him to open up about it in public. There isn\u2019t a player around who is less interested in the trimmings of the game. He disdains his publicity. The only time you ever see him retreat is when there is a camera in his face. A photographer hired to take his portrait tells how Farrell spent their three-minute shoot refusing to look at the camera, and muttering \u201cI fucking hate this\u201d under his breath. So you have that conversation with everyone else. \u201cI think he\u2019s been a captain ever since he was born, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d says Lawrence Dallaglio, talking at an event to promote Land Rover\u2019s sponsorship of the tournament. \u201cHe\u2019s probably heard moves even before he was born. From a very early age he\u2019s walked around the pitch with his dad, and watched his dad lift trophies in every corner of the globe. He thinks that\u2019s normal.\u201d With Wigan Andy Farrell won six league championships, four Challenge Cups, two Harry Sunderland trophies \u2013 given to the Grand Final man of the match, two Man of Steel awards and one Golden Boot. But even after all that, there were a couple that got away. Like this one: the Rugby World Cup. He was part of the squad that went on to lose 15-6 in the 2007 final, to a Springbok team coached by Jake White and Eddie Jones. Owen Farrell was there for that one too, babysitting Dallaglio\u2019s children in the stands. A year later he joined Saracens, and a year after that, he made his debut for them. He was 17. And, in one of the many strange coincidences in this story, Jones was now his head coach. \u201cAbout two years later we turned the TV on and my son went: \u2018I guess he won\u2019t be babysitting for me any more,\u2019\u201d Dallaglio remembers. \u201cI said: \u2018No, he won\u2019t be actually. Sorry about that.\u2019\u201d By 2012, Owen Farrell was playing for England. Stuart Lancaster picked him in his first match as head coach, against Scotland. Years later, all Farrell could really clearly remember about it were the mistakes he made, like two kicks he missed from the halfway line. Even back then he was mercilessly competitive. \u201cI blame my dad,\u201d he has said. \u201cHe never let me win at anything.\u201d That first week Lancaster told him: \u201cI need you to be yourself straight away, I need to hear your voice if you\u2019ve got something to say.\u201d Farrell was never shy about speaking up to his teammates, and didn\u2019t need to be asked again. But hard as he was in those years, and well as he played, it still felt like there was something missing. There were questions about his temper and his temperament and his technique. It felt telling that, picked for the 2013 Lions tour, he was unused in the first two Tests and only played 17 minutes of the third and final match of the series. You can\u2019t demand respect. You have to earn it. And he was a leader, but never a captain, in an England team that often cracked in the big matches. That grand slam game, yes, and the World Cup pool matches against Wales and Australia in 2015. Jones took over as coach after that. He had different ideas about captaincy to Lancaster, wanted a leader with \u201ca bit of mongrel\u201d in him. Farrell had it. But Jones could see he wasn\u2019t ready yet. He needed nurturing. He chose Dylan Hartley. In the background, he was working on Farrell, too. And when Hartley first came down injured, Farrell was promoted to co-captain. For a year they shared the role. Jones even had them room together, so Farrell could learn every last thing from him. Farrell was a quick studier. He learned to change the way he spoke to the referees, learned to keep his temper in check, learned to change his tackling technique when it became a liability. And all of a sudden, the student didn\u2019t need the teacher any more, and England didn\u2019t need Hartley. Jones had Jonny Wilkinson working with Farrell too. \u201cI feel like his journey has been a journey of mostly letting go,\u201d Wilkinson, another Land Rover ambassador, said. \u201cHe picks things up so quickly in terms of technique and understanding, that he is constantly challenging himself, asking: \u2018Why does it have to be this way?\u2019 In the beginning he was slightly more reactive, but now he is revealing more of his ability to make his own choices. And as a player that\u2019s what you need, because if you\u2019ve been on your line for 10 minutes, and then the other team score, the players are looking at their captain, and he has to say: \u2018This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 That\u2019s leadership.\u201d It has got to the point, Wilkinson says, where there\u2019s nothing much left he can teach him. Jones feels the same way. \u201cI said when I first took over, my job\u2019s to become redundant. And I\u2019m almost redundant now,\u201d he said. This is Farrell\u2019s team now. Jones calls him the \u201cfather of the group\u201d. Farrell still has that same mean streak in him, so pitiless on the field he seems almost supercilious. He wasn\u2019t smiling at the All Blacks, but smirking at them. There are plenty of players who have tried to wipe that look off his face. USA\u2019s John Quill tried it with one shoulder, Argentina\u2019s Tom\u00e1s Lavinini with the other. And Farrell was still up in time to watch them get sent off. But there\u2019s more behind it now, something deeper, more authentic, like Thomas said, all those years ago, you can see it in his eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
