Brilliant under the high ball and made Yoann Huget's second try with a clever kick. 14 Yoann Huget 7/10 The Toulouse wing scored with his first touch and added a second with a brilliant opportunist effort a quarter of an hour later. He was always a threat. 13 Mathieu Bastareaud 4/10 The Toulon centre is a wrecking ball, but he hardly delivered a pass and was well marshalled by England's Burrell and Twelvetrees. Will come under pressure for his place. 12 Wesley Fofana 5/10 Scored a spectacular try at Twickenham last year, but hardly had a run at England's defence. His partnership with Bastareaud never really clicked. 11 Maxime M\u00e9dard 6/10 Always looked a threat on the counterattack and helped make Jack Nowell's debut uncomfortable. The Toulouse man hardly put a foot wrong. 10 Jules Plisson 5/10 Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9's big gamble. The 22-year-old debutant likes to play on the gainline, but had little opportunity, and dropping Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc may have been premature. 9 Jean-Marc Doussain 5/10 Morgan Parra will put the Toulouse scrum-half under pressure for his place when he returns after a knee injury. Like Parra h can kick goals, but replacement Maxime Machenaud looked sharper. 1 Thomas Domingo 6/10 An absolute powerhouse in the scrum and gave England a few problems before the interval. Something of a mystery why he was taken off after the break. 2 Benjamin Kayser 5/10 He will now do well to hold on to the No2 shirt for the game against Italy next Sunday. Kayser was too quiet and Dimitri Szarzewski is much more dangerous as a replacement. 3 Nicolas Mas 5/10 The Montpellier prop scrummaged well but looks a bit of a fading force. When he left the field after the break he looked relieved. Under pressure too. 4 Alexandre Flanquart 5/10 Was outplayed by Lawes and Launchbury, and Yoann Maestri's muscular presence after the interval as a replacement will give Saint-Andr\u00e9 food for thought. 5 Pascal Pap\u00e9 6/10 The Stade Fran\u00e7ais lock admitted his captaincy is temporary but did enough to convince he will lead France this tournament. Improved as the game wore on. 6 Yannick Nyanga 7/10 Easily France's best forward. Nyanga was a constant threat with the ball in hand and his tackling was as forceful as ever. A superb effort. 7 Bernard Le Roux 6/10 He may only be keeping the seat warm for Thierry Dusautoir but he was effective for 40 minutes before being replaced. A good defensive effort. 8 Louis Picamoles 7/10 The strong man from Toulouse did not have things his own way against Billy Vunipola (who he taught a few lessons in the Heinken Cup last autumn), but a solid display. REPLACEMENTS Dimitri Szarzewski (for Kayser 43) Forceful presence in the loose 7 Yannick Forestier (for Domingo 49) Did little wrong 6 Rabah Slimani (for Mas 49) Made some crunching tackles 7 Yoann Maestri (for Flanquart 43) Effective in the lineout 7 Antoine Burban (for Le Roux ht) Showed his pace 6 Damien Chouly (for Picamoles 55) Got through lots of work 6 Maxime Machenaud (for Doussain 57) Much sharper than the Toulouse man 6 Ga\u00ebl Fickou (for Bastareaud 74) The dream substitution. Took try brilliantly 7"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
