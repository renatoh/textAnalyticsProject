The 73-year-old former England manager was taken ill while watching Ipswich two weeks ago. Tests carried out since have revealed a \"very small tumour\", which will be removed on Wednesday. He is expected to make a full recovery. Robson had a tumour removed from a lung in May and in 1995 he was found to have a rare form of skin cancer behind an eye, and underwent complex surgery. In 1992 he survived bowel cancer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
