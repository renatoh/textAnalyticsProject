The publisher initially rejected allegations of antisemitism in the book, which claims to reveal \u201cthe 22 secret strategies of global power\u201d. But after continued pressure from organisations including the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which called for the book\u2019s withdrawal, Penguin commissioned an external review, led by Julia Neuberger, which yesterday announced its results. Imprint Ebury is therefore printing no more copies of the English-language edition and has frozen stock, sending no further copies out to retailers. Three thousand copies are believed to have been printed, with around 500 copies sold to date. Rights to translation revert to the Spanish publisher. The allegations of antisemitism first arose when the author Jeremy Duns questioned why passages from the Spanish language edition of How They Rule the World had been omitted from the English translation. Duns discovered that a section tackling the Rothschild banking dynasty, who are often subject to antisemitic conspiracy theories, did not appear in the English version, and accused Penguin of having knowingly published \u201ca Spanish antisemitic conspiracy theorist \u2026 because to cover it up they\u2019ve removed passages about the Rothschilds\u201d. After an internal review from the publisher found that while Ba\u00f1os, a colonel in the Spanish army, \u201cclearly expresses robust opinions\u201d, they were not antisemitic, continued pressure led Penguin Random House to commission an independent external review led by Neuberger. It found \u201cechoes of Jewish conspiracy theories\u201d in \u201ccertain passages and references\u201d in the Spanish-language edition. She was helped by two Spanish antisemitism experts, Martina Weisz and Stefanie Sch\u00fceler-Springorum, with the team working to review the content of both editions of the book. The panel did not consider either the UK or the Spanish edition of the book to be antisemitic, but said that Ebury should have \u201casked more questions and conducted deeper due diligence to determine whether it was appropriate to publish\u201d. Penguin called the issue \u201chighly sensitive and nuanced\u201d and accepted the review\u2019s findings. \u201cPenguin Random House UK publishes for readers of all backgrounds, faiths and nationalities, \u201d said chief executive Tom Weldon, \u201cand the review and our resulting actions underline our commitment to that mission. But it also demonstrates that, in this particular case, our publishing judgement fell short; we must learn from that and improve.\u201d Neuberger praised the publisher\u2019s \u201cspeedy\u201d reaction. \u201cThere clearly were some complex questions here, but the thoroughness with which the publisher investigated shows considerable integrity,\u201d she said. Duns called the decision \u201cgood news\u201d on Twitter, but added that \u201cthe idea the Spanish edition isn\u2019t antisemitic is an insult to people\u2019s intelligence, and I\u2019d like to know how the changes happened in the English version\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
