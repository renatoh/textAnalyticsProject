They have charged me \u00a3117.77 on top of my usual bill, and I am desperate since I am unemployed at the moment. Is this a normal tariff for a three-minute call? SM, London Reverse-charge international calls are notoriously expensive and this was no exception. BT explained that \"collect calls\" (reverse-charge calls) are charged in one minute blocks with a five-minute minimum. It says your son made two calls one of three minutes and another one of four minutes, which, because of this formula, were charged at the same five-minute price. The fees for collect calls at the time of the calls was \u00a38.76 per minute, plus a facility fee of \u00a315 per call. BT has agreed, as a gesture of goodwill, to recalculate the calls using the cost of a direct-dial call to Brazil. This totals \u00a335.91 so, taking that off the \u00a3117.77, it has credited your account with \u00a381.86. Next time your son is abroad you might want to tell him not to make a reverse-charge call and instead, if he has a mobile, to text you and ask you to call him back on a landline number.
