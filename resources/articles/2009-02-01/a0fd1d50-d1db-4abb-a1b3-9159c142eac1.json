The first was between what might be called the \"nation-builders\" and the \"war pursuers\". This divided those, mainly Europeans, who argued for a building up of Afghanistan's national capacity \u2013 through a strengthening of its professional police, army and judiciary, combating corruption and supporting civil society \u2013 against those, mainly US neocons, who saw the primary task as hunting down and killing as many Taliban as possible. The advent of the Obama administration has clearly tipped the balance of the first debate towards a nation-building strategy. There will be less reliance on air strikes, which have caused so many civilian casualties, and more \"boots on the ground\", through an increase in US troop strength. At the same time the US wants \"the development worker\" rather than \"the solider\" to become the public face of the international presence. US conversion to this strategy will be greeted with delight in European capitals and by many others in the international community who have been driven to despair by the myopic and counterproductive policies of the Bush regime. The second argument is about the nature of the international presence in Afghanistan itself, and this remains unresolved. Some have argued for a centralised command and control over both the civilian and military parts of the mission, while others favour civilian independence and accountability and oversight over military operations. The \"integrated command\" model has many European backers, including Britain's Paddy Ashdown, who argued for the job for himself, based on the high proconsul position he had when he ruled over Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has been opposed by the Afghan government, and many within the UN mission (Unama), who argue that a degree of separation between the civilian and military components is necessary, both to strengthen national capacity and to allow for independent human rights monitoring. The lack of accountability of western military forces has been a significant cause of increasing Afghan alienation. Obama could still come down on either side of this debate. Unama has significantly scaled up its presence in the last year and also has far more human rights monitors in place. Their reports have helped to focus attention on issues such as corruption in the police and judiciary, and also on the growing number of civilians killed in western military air strikes. This is known to have infuriated the US and UK military and seems to have been what led to the recent arrest of Colonel Owen McNally. McNally was the liaison officer between Unama and the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf). It was his job to keep the two respective organisations informed about one another's activities \u2013 a standard task that is common to all UN missions, where the model is for independence and oversight. Following his arrest, a number of British newspapers insinuated that he was having an affair with a Human Rights Watch researcher. A similar insinuation was made about his relationship with the head of Unama's human rights unit. The stories themselves are ridiculous, but have served to draw attention away from the far more significant fact that his arrest was politically motivated. One Ministry of Defence official admitted to the Daily Mail that the information that he is alleged to have passed on did not concern any operational details, but exposed contradictions in official accounts about casualty details. \"The whole point of defeating the Taliban is winning hearts and minds and stopping the population joining their cause,\" said the source. \"If they think we're lying to them, it could become a very dangerous place. This has caused a diplomatic row and the Americans are not happy at all.\" A Unama report due to be released next month is likely to show that over 3,000 civilians were killed by both sides last year. The UN has also become increasingly vocal in condemning civilian deaths. Some argue that this type of criticism \"undermines the war effort\" and that the civilian component of the mission should be subordinate to the military. Others argue that Unama colluding in cover-ups would fatally damage Unama's credibility. The arrest and smearing of McNally seems mainly to have been carried out for its \"chilling\" silencing effect on other critics. However, shooting the messenger rarely proves the most effective way of dealing with bad news."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
