And I want to express my condolences to all the families.\" Such humility conveys Alonso's charm. He believes he is a normal person, a regular guy who just happens to be involved in the sport he loves. He radiates a geniality which belies the fact that he is one of that select tipped to challenge Michael Schumacher and the all-conquering Ferraris. When he won last year's Hungarian grand prix for Renault, Alonso became the youngest race winner in the history of the official world championship. That beat a record established by Bruce McLaren which had stood since the 1959 US grand prix at Sebring. Over four decades ago McLaren arrived on the scene as a bright young talent but the signs are that Alonso is even more promising. He has the potential to win world championships. Twelve months ago he qualified fastest here in Malaysia, the sport's youngest pole sitter. He went on to finish third in the race, then really captured the imagination of his compatriots by splitting the Ferraris to finish second behind Schumacher in the Spanish grand prix. A week later, when Alonso demonstrated the Renault in the streets of Madrid, more than 100,000 turned out to cheer him on. For most of the time Alonso lives in Oxford, where his flowing locks, stubbly chin and bandana ensure that he merges seamlessly with the student population. He is also only a few miles from the Renault base at Enstone, near Chipping Norton. \"Three years ago I moved to Oxford because the factory is in Enstone and I was very close and it was easier for me to be close to the team,\" he says. \"But now I find another advantage, a big advantage that in Oxford I can live but in Spain I cannot.\" He still finds his celebrity status a little baffling. \"In Spain it is difficult to go out to dinner with my friends and normal things become a little bit more difficult,\" he said. \"But it is also nice to feel all these people, you know, they are supporting you; they are fans; I feel OK as well. It is not upsetting me. Also, if I have one week free with no testing, no nothing, maybe you go one week to Spain and the next week free, you go to England. You have to have some balance.\" He shrugs aside the idea that he might be targeted by a top team such as Ferrari, professing a desire to stay with Renault and their powerful team principal Flavio Briatore who engineered his formula one debut with Minardi in 2001. \"I have two more years' contract here with Renault,\" he says. \"Flavio is happy to keep me here and I am happy to stay here, because Renault is growing up very well and is now regarded as a top team. At the end of two years I think we will study all the possibilities and Flavio will be very useful in helping me. Flavio is one of the people who have helped me most in F1. Everything I have achieved in F1 is down to him, so I am very proud to be his driver.\" He admits he would gain more satisfaction growing into a championship contender with Renault and making a contribution to the team's effort rather than being parachuted into an existing race-winning car. \"I think that would be the case for any driver to grow up from zero with a team to win races and fight for the championship,\" he said. \"This is a good feeling. Sure, I believe I can be world champion but that is the same for everybody on the grid. If they didn't, they wouldn't race.\" This weekend Alonso hopes that his Renault's Michelin tyres will give him a performance edge, though he was ninth in yesterday's free practice. \"You have all types of corners here in Sepang,\" he says. \"You have very slow corners, high-speed corners, downhill, uphill, long straights. So it's difficult to set the car up for all parts of the circuit. For the driver it makes it a very tough race . . . it will be an interesting weekend, I think.\" As with all the great drivers Alonso's speed flows easily from his fingertips. Even at this early stage of his career he is one of the most complete performers on the grid. The young and the old: \u00b7Alonso was the youngest grand prix winner at 22 years 27 days, ahead of Bruce McLaren (22 years 104 days), Jacky Ickx (22 years 188 days) and Kimi Raikkonen (23 years 157 days). \u00b7Alonso was the third youngest driver to make his formula one debut, being 19 years seven months four days old at the 2001 Australian GP. Only Mike Thackwell (19 years five months 29 days) in a Tyrrell at the Canadian GP in 1980 and Ricardo Rodriguez in a Ferrari at the 1961 Italian GP (19 years six months 27 days) were younger. \u00b7The oldest formula one winner was Luigi Fagioli who was 53 years 22 days old when he shared the winning Alfa Romeo 158 with Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1951 French GP at Reims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
