Rarely, if ever, has such a strongly worded communique emerged from the IRB's Dublin headquarters and there was no disguising Millar's anger at what the board clearly regard as a deliberate challenge to the authority of the sport's ruling body. Far from proffering a diplomatic olive branch, he has warned the rebels to back down and openly queried the motives of the club's wealthy backers. The IRB's most senior official, fearful of the knock-on effects for smaller unions, is also adamant that the Heineken Cup must continue. \"The decision by the French and English clubs to withdraw from the European Rugby Cup has been described as regrettable, unfortunate and shameful. It is more than that. It is absolutely disgraceful and selfish to destroy a tournament which has developed into a hugely successful and special annual rugby event that is vital to the wellbeing of European rugby,\" said Millar. \"It will have serious consequences for world rugby. It is unbelievable that one man should be allowed to bring European rugby to this state. We understand that not all clubs agree. Is there no-one among the clubs of France who has the courage to say no, we will not be part of this? \"I have always had a great respect for Serge Blanco as a player and a person but in this instance I can only assume he is being very badly advised or he is being naive and has allowed himself to be used by certain people in England not just to destabilise ERC but to support a challenge to the way club rugby is governed. The rugby unions of the world will not allow 26 clubs to dictate the course of world rugby and the present situation has brought those unions even closer and more determined to preserve the game for the good of all.\" Nowhere in Millar's lengthy diatribe is there any hint of criticism for the Rugby Football Union, whose refusal to hand 50% of its shareholding and voting rights in ERC to Premier Rugby until club representatives make concessions on other issues has fuelled the dispute and hardened the clubs' resolve. The latter, who were considering their response last night, will also regard Millar's criticism of \"entrepreneur\" owners as further proof the IRB is living in the past and has not significantly moved on from the feudal amateur days. Millar, though, remains an unashamed traditionalist. He added: \"The Premiership clubs in the main are owned by entrepreneurs who are not used to and do not like deferring to governing bodies such as the RFU. They do not want to have a governing body which controls the game for the good of all and not just for a handful of elite professional clubs. \"The most significant and illuminating statement as to the clubs' true intent came in a Sunday newspaper where Mr [Keith] Barwell [chairman] of the Northampton club was quoted as saying: 'We'll run our own business and the RFU can mind their own business'. What does he mean? Indeed, it is difficult to get from the clubs what they want, as their objectives seem to change regularly. Some now suggest a new ERC Championship should be put in place. We don't need a new one. We have one. What next, a new Six Nations run by the Premiership clubs?\" Millar is still hoping a peace deal can be struck and will have talks with the Six Nations unions following the European Rugby Cup shareholder and board meetings taking place in Dublin tomorrow and Thursday. \"It is not too late for the Premiership clubs to reverse their decision and have the courage to do so,\" he said. There are also plans to talk to other leading unions worldwide to \"allay the fears on the direction professional rugby is taking in Europe\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
