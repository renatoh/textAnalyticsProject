Pocock has a sore back and missed Friday's captain's run; Ben McCalman will replace him. Much of Ireland's preparation this week has focused on neutralising the threat of Pocock at the breakdown and the scrum-half Will Genia running off the base of rucks, so with the openside out of the picture it will change the complexion of the contest. McCalman is not an out and out openside, but then neither is Sean O'Brien, who forms part of an Irish back row that has massive ball-carrying ability. The issue is whether or not Ireland can get enough ball. The winger Keith Earls sat out Ireland's captain's run, though the defence coach, Les Kiss, said it was not injury-related. \"Keith is fine. We have protocols in place where players will work certain parts of the week and have little rest periods here and there so that's just part of our planning. So he's completely fine.\" If Ireland fail to overcome Australia at Eden Park on Saturday, and leave themselves having to beat Italy in their final game to ensure qualification for the knockout stages, they can comfort themselves that it will not have been for lack of forethought. Ireland will have amply prepared to neutralise the scrum-half Will Genia.When asked if Ireland had a strategy in place to deal with Genia and his fly-half, Quade Cooper, Les Kiss, Ireland's defence coach said: \"The night before grabbing hold of them, locking them up and putting them in a room somewhere? Short of that, no. It's something to be aware of. They're critical to what they do in their game. \"Cooper does rely on what Genia can do to the defence around the ruck area so obviously we've focused a little bit on that in terms of closing down the options that Genia does have. Cooper? Again, depending on how the game goes in terms of conditions, we've just got to find the right moments to put pressure on what he wants to do. And then if the right pressure is there he has to ask himself the question of himself, is he up for it? I guess that's what it's about: people respond to pressure in different ways. It's a big Test match for us and it's a big Test match for them.\" There is an acknowledgment in the Ireland camp that if they do not surpass their one standout performance this year \u2013 against England in the Six Nations in March \u2013 they will be chasing the runners-up spot in Pool C with Italy, their final opponents. And their record in big games against the Wallabies is so bad as to make them rank outsiders. Ireland have lost all four previous World Cup meetings with the Wallabies and they have beaten them only twice in the past 15 meetings \u2013 both of those were in rain-sodden November internationals at the end of the Australians' season. Nevertheless, there is a feeling in the Ireland squad that the huge performance required to survive this Test is at hand. Certainly the full-back Rob Kearney who, along with the loosehead prop Cian Healy and O'Brien, is fit after missing the USA game in New Plymouth last weekend, is thinking positively. \"If we do screw up and have a bad tournament then people can jump in and give us everything we deserve,\" Kearney said. \"But until we actually fail, if that is what happens, I would prefer everyone to come together as a nation and just get behind each other. It's quite an Irish thing and I think how everything is going at home outside of sport, everyone is jumping on each other and we always look at the negatives far more so than we do at the positives. \"As soon as we got over here, everyone forgot about August, which was important and that was something that had to be done. Last month went horribly wrong for us but it doesn't determine how you are going to do in a World Cup. If we win four warm-up games it doesn't mean we are going to win a World Cup and if we lose four it doesn't mean we are going to crash out early.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
