In a news conference during which he outlined key aims for his second term, he confirmed America would increase troop numbers in Iraq and said Iraqis would be able to vote on a draft constitution next October. He said more had to be done to improve the country's fledgling security force before elections on January 30. \"I certainly don't expect the process to be trouble-free,\" Mr Bush said. \"The elections in January are the beginning of a process and it is important for the American people to understand that.\" \"I would call the results mixed,\" he said about the US effort to put Iraqi security in the hands of its own people. \"When the heat got on, they left the battlefield - that is unacceptable,\" he said. \"The bombers are having an effect,\" he said, accusing insurgents in Iraq of trying to \"disrupt the democratic process\". \"Hundreds of innocent Iraqis are being killed,\" he said. President Bush took the opportunity to support his beleaguered defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. He said Mr Rumsfeld, criticised for using a machine to sign his name on letters of condolence to relatives of killed soldiers, was doing a \"fine job\" and he expected him to continue doing so. On domestic matters, Mr Bush said he would submit a federal budget that would halve the US deficit in five years and \"maintain strict discipline in spending tax dollars\". \"We will provide every tool and resource for our military; we will protect the homeland.\" In the 17th news conference of his presidency, Mr Bush said he would \"fix the social security system for children and grandchildren\", prioritise school and health reforms and \"build a stronger, more prosperous country\". His fiscal 2006 budget is due to go before congress in February. Mr Bush defended his close ties with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had disagreements over the war on terror and, more recently, over the disputed elections in Ukraine. \"The relationship's an important relationship and I would call the relationship a good relationship,\" Bush said, adding that he has talked with Mr Putin about getting Russia admitted to the World Trade Organisation. Earlier this month, Mr Putin said he could not imagine how Iraqi elections could be held under \"conditions of occupation by foreign forces\", a reference to the United States. Mr Bush will meet Mr Putin in Slovakia in late February. Critics have raised questions about whether enough US troops are in Iraq to bring security for the elections. More than 1,300 American troops have died since the war began in March 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
