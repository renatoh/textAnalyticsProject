I learned this during my years as a Saturday girl at Waitrose and Waterstones. As patients do with doctors, the relentlessly questing, questioning, purchasing customers made the job so much harder than it needed to be. So what bliss to close the doors on the last of these demanding people, turn back to the quiet emporium, empty of everything but inventory in beautiful stasis, and spend the next six hours finding out exactly what we had and where we had it. It soothed the very soul. (And I was on time-and-a-half, too, although I'd have done it, as I would anything that involves making long, purposeful lists, for free.) Now that I have completely given up on even entertaining the ghost of a shadow of a simulacrum of a notion of going out on New Year's Eve, I like to use the few quiet hours afforded me by not having to travel across London, get blattered with friends and then wait, freezing, for 10 hours at the bus stop, to do something of a spiritual stocktake of myself instead and \u2013 because those who accuse me (me! Me? Me?! Me!!) of being a solipsistic shitbag could not be more wrong \u2013 of the world at large. Me first. How have I measured up this year? Have my achievements outpaced my failures? Should we first ask whether \"achievements\" should be in the plural? Only if I finish Wolf Hall in the next 48 hours, or if you count \"trying samphire\" and \"liking samphire\" as two discrete things. The failures? All the old ones (still haven't made a souffl\u00e9, read any Dickens, had sex outdoors, worked out my position on the badger cull, been to a pop-up anything or seen moonlight). Plus I now talk to myself in the street even if I haven't got the baby with me; I can't eat fewer than four Tunnock's caramel wafers in a row; and I cried for 90 minutes at the news that Linda Gray (Sue Ellen) was at Larry Hagman's bedside when he died. The world? Well, Superman's given up his job at the Daily Planet to become a blogger. Maria Miller is everything you would sacrifice entire limbs to avoid having as a secretary of state for culture, media and sport, and minister for women and equalities. 30 Rock has been cancelled and we still don't have The Colbert Report over here. A book that contains the lines, \"Jeez, he looks so freaking hot. My subconscious is frantically fanning herself, and my inner goddess is swaying and writhing to some primal carnal rhythm\" has taken the world by storm. And I know that someone, at some point, is going to make me watch Anne Hathaway in Les Mis\u00e9rables. Still, no time for moaning, fretting or building a palisade against friends seeking me out with a copy of Victor Hugo in one hand and a lifesize cutout of Hugh Jackman in the other. I've got two days to finish Wolf Hall, there's a full moon, I've got a souffl\u00e9 in the oven and 40 minutes \u2013 if all the right things pop up \u2013 to start Gradgrinding in a silvered field and make a final decision on this badger thing. Wish me luck. And a happy new year to you all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
