Republican Senator Bob Corker said the foreign relations committee plans to vote next Thursday on a bill that would require Congress\u2019 approval for any nuclear agreement with Iran, in direct opposition to the president\u2019s wishes. If approved by the committee, the bill would move to a vote in the Senate. But Corker\u2019s bill, if it reaches the Oval Office, will face a presidential veto, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, calling on Democratic senators to reject it. \u201cPassing this kind of legislation would interfere in the negotiations,\u201d he said, and would also impinge on presidential authority.\u201d Meanwhile, the House committee on foreign relations angrily interrogated deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken about talks with Iran, which resumed in Switzerland hours earlier. Both Democrats and Republicans searched for weaknesses in the Obama administration\u2019s plans and seized on almost every opportunity to argue for greater influence. Blinken urged Congress not to disrupt negotiations, for instance by passing new sanctions taking action that would \u201ccall into question the president\u2019s authority to make commitments that the United States will keep,\u201d such as the open letter to the Iranian regime signed by 47 Republican senators.. \u201cNegotiating with a foreign nation is the president\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIf there is confusion on this basic point, no foreign government will trust that when a president purports to speak for our country he actually does.\u201d Blinken attempted to placate several angry representatives who demanded Congress have more authority in the negotiations, saying the administration has \u201cmore than 200 meetings, calls, [and] briefings\u201d with elected officials regarding the talks. But he made clear that the Obama administration will seek a \u201cnon-binding agreement\u201d that, like most international agreements, is not technically a treaty requiring Congress\u2019s advice and consent. \u201cHaving a non-binding agreement allows us to have the flexibility we need to snap back sanctions immediately, not having to wait for international partners,\u201d he said. Congress would have a role in lifting sanctions only if Iran \u201cdemonstrates compliance\u201d over the course of years, Blinken said. But representative Ed Royce called the administration\u2019s statements that Congress has a role to play \u201cdisingenuous\u201d, in light of a limited vote on lifting sanctions, held off at least for several years. Blinken described the threat of future sanctions as \u201ckeeping that sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the Iranians\u201d that would keep it in line with an inspections regimen and the terms of the deal. A one-year breakout time for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, the estimate under the proposed terms of the deal, was actually \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cmore than enough time not only to detect abuse of the agreement but also to act on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIntrusive\u201d inspections would continue indefinitely, Blinken added, and target Iran\u2019s program \u201cfrom cradle to grave of the production process: mines, mills, factories, centrifuge facilities.\u201d When several representatives asked about what effect a military option might have on Iran\u2019s program, Blinken tried to convince his interrogators that negotiations were more pragmatic: \u201cthey have the knowledge, and we can\u2019t bomb that away, we can\u2019t sanction that away.\u201d Adam Szubin, undersecretary of the Treasury Department, testified to the committee that Iran \u201cremains under massive strain\u201d under sanctions. \u201cThe size of the hole that Iran is in,\u201d Szubin said, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a hole that could be described in one sense as a $200bn hole, which are the losses that we assess they\u2019ve suffered since 2012 due to sanctions.\u201d However the representatives had little patience for many of Blinken\u2019s arguments, with Democrat Brad Sherman saying it was \u201cpreposterous\u201d to believe Iran would adhere to a deal. The deputy secretary also tried to reassure the committee that the Obama administration is working \u201cvirtually every day\u201d to bring American citizens imprisoned in Iran home, and that the US does not trust the Iranian regime. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we think these are good guys who like the United States. It\u2019s that there are some people who are more pragmatic for what Iran needs to do for its own future,\u201d he said. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu also loomed large over a congressional hearing on US negotiations with Iran on Tuesday, prompting one representative to deliver a tirade denouncing Netanyahu for an \u201cinsult to this government\u201d. Democratic representative Gerry Connolly angrily interrupted a hearing of deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken to turn on his Republican colleagues who had criticized President Obama for his \u201cdisdain\u201d for the recently re-elected prime minister. \u201cA foreign leader has insulted the head of state of the United States government,\u201d Connolly said, referring to Netanyahu\u2019sthe Israeli prime minister\u2019s controversial speech to Congress on just two weeks before his re-election. That speech, which Netanyahu used to denounce a proposed deal between the US, Iran and UN powers over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, is believed to have strained already troubled relations between the White House and Tel Aviv. \u201cIt didn\u2019t start with President Obama, it started with Bibi Netanyahu,\u201d Connolly continued. \u201cFriends don\u2019t act that way,\u201d he said, before turning on House Republicans: \u201cDoes the partisan rhetoric ever stop? Where are your loyalties with respect to the prerogatives of this government and our country?\u201d Earlier in the hearing, Republican representatives Steve Chabot and Dana Rohrabacher grilled Blinken as a representative of Obama\u2019s White House, with the former asking Blinken: \u201cwouldn\u2019t a bad deal be throwing Israel under the proverbial bus?\u201d \u201cHow is the administration going to repair relations\u201d with Israel, Chabot asked. Blinken carefully avoided confessing that Obama and Netanyahu do not get along, emphasizing Israel\u2019s security over relations and paraphrasing a statement made by the prime minister himself: \u201cno administration has done more for Israel\u2019s security than this administration.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
