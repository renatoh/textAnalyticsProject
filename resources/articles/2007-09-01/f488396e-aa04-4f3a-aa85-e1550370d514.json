For all West Ham's faults, they are a team who know how to break quickly from deep positions and have the players to capitalise on counter-attacks. Reading defeated West Ham 6-0 in their last meeting here on New Year's Day, so Steve Coppell's team really should have known better. But clearly they didn't. Three times, they recklessly committed men forward and allowed West Ham to run at their backpedalling defence. Three times, they were punished. Three men deserve special praise. Craig Bellamy, showing pace and poise, scored the first and teed up the second. Matthew Etherington delivered the killer touches for the second goal and then - in the dying moments - the third. And the other West Ham hero was their goalkeeper Robert Green, who made the 76th-minute save from Kevin Doyle's penalty that ensured it would be a far more comfortable end to the game than it could have been for Alan Curbishley's team. This was a free-flowing game - albeit lacking in quality - that could have turned out so differently had Reading been more watchful and less profligate. They never seemed truly out of the contest until the final minutes but, equally, looked like they needed to step up a gear in front of goal. Coppell cut a nervous figure, looking on as his team, normally so hard to break down, were dismantled. 'It's the first time since I've been here that I was frightened every time we attacked,' he said. 'It was naive to say the least. Two of their goals came from our corners.' West Ham were encouraged by Dean Ashton's return to their starting line-up and they began adventurously. The early goal arrived after Bryn Gunnarsson's pass was crucially intercepted by Lee Bowyer in West Ham's half of the field. Bowyer then threaded the ball forward to Bellamy. The former Liverpool striker embarked on a lengthy run down the right before moving in towards the edge of the box and producing an angled drive that evaded Marcus Hahnemann. Reading's best chance of the half came seconds before the interval when Graeme Murty's long pass fell into the path of Doyle. He knocked the ball back for Stephen Hunt, who struck sweetly. He was peeling away, ready to celebrate, but had to watch the ball dip on to the bar. West Ham reasserted their supremacy after half-time and doubled the lead following a brilliant passing move involving Hayden Mullins, Etherington and Bellamy. It culminated in a swift one-two between Bellamy and Etherington before the latter's fierce finish. West Ham manager Alan Curbishley recognised the outstanding contribution of Bellamy. 'The fans will just lap it up if he does the business here,' he said. Reading had an escape when Ashton headed on for Bellamy. The Welshman's pass was collected by Bowyer, whose shot was a whisker away from sneaking inside the far post. 'I wanted to strangle him,' said Curbishley, speaking about Bowyer. Reading continued creating chances, but repeatedly spurned them. The most disappointing moment for Reading came when Green felled Dave Kitson, leading to the penalty that was saved. Etherington wrapped up the game, fittingly, with a breakaway run from the halfway line that ended in him arrowing the ball beyond Hahnemann from 18 yards. Man of the match: Craig Bellamy His opener was a fi ne example of the devastation he can inflict on the opposition when West Ham break with speed. His composure was admirable during the build-up to that fi rst goal. He then played an instrumental part in putting the visitors 2-0 ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
