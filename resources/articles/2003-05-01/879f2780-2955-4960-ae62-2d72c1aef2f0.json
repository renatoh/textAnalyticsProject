FROM BRUSSELS A tidying-up exercise or a blueprint for tyranny? As Michael White is busy touring Kuwait with the PM, the Backbencher called the Guardian's Europe editor, Ian Black, and asked for his view on the draft constitution. \"You wouldn't know it listening to the outraged cries from the Eurosceptic press, but Britain has negotiated long and hard over this week's draft constitution for Europe. In fact, Valery Giscard d'Estaing has listened very carefully to the concerns of the larger European governments, and specifically to those coming from the UK. It was because of a clear and fairly insistent request from Tony Blair, just the other day, that he agreed to remove from the text the famous F-word - the reference to federalism - which so upsets people in Britain. \"More generally, Giscard has tried to produce a document which will be accepted by national governments. It's important to remember that at the end of the day, the constitution - and the treaty of which it will become a part - will be decided by governments. So if they don't like it, they will use their vetoes and all this work will be in vain. I don't think the governments want to do that because it would look a little brutal and undemocratic. After all, the convention has been quite a wide exercise involving over a hundred MPs, MEPs and representatives of governments who have some kind of democratic legitimacy. Still, they will use their vetoes if they dislike the result. \"Giscard wants his place in history as the man who drew up Europe's constitution, so he is trying to accommodate governments' concerns - particularly big ones such as the UK. He doesn't necessarily care so much about smaller states or those joining the union next year. What is very interesting, looking at this story from Brussels, is the bemused response from elsewhere in Europe. To nearly all other Europeans this is an exercise about updating the rulebook in a reasonably sensible way for an EU which is changing. It simply does not create the kind of passion and fury we're seeing in Britain - this series of charge and counter-charge from the Eurosceptic press against the government, and then the government fighting back as if an awful lot were at stake. \"I think that the question of a referendum will always remain one for individual countries - whether it's in their national tradition and requirement or not. Germany, for example, never has referendums - partly because of the legacy of the Nazi era, where they saw that a plebiscite was something that could be manipulated. In contrast, Denmark is required by its own constitution to call a referendum on anything deemed to affect its national sovereignty. The Danes have had referendums on every single European treaty since they joined along with Britain in 1973 and briefly became the Eurosceptics' heroes when they threw out the Maastricht in 1991-1992, before saying no to the euro in 2000. \"The key question over the constitution is this: to what extent will it - in its final form (which we haven't yet seen) - bring in radical changes? If it does, then it strengthens the case for holding a UK referendum. If it's just a tidying-up exercise, as the British government has argued, then the argument is less forceful. I think it's a bit more than that, but I certainly don't think it's a blueprint for tyranny as some of the Eurosceptic tabloids have been claiming; so it's a matter of judgment and a matter of national tradition.\" NEWS ROUND-UP The government has rolled out its big hitters to promote the draft EU constitution. Tony Blair will visit British troops in Iraq during his tour of the Gulf. Senior officers at Doncaster council could receive pay increases of up to 35% if councillors agree to the rises at a meeting next week. The BBC is refusing to cut footage of the dead bodies of two British soldiers from a documentary about the Iraq war, despite Tony Blair's intervention. COMPETITIONS A tiresome email glitch means that the Backbencher is unable to declare the winner of last week's competition. This week, however, she has a 74-minute CD to give away, courtesy of Jerden Records. Ronald Reagan: The Great Speeches Volume One features highlights from the Great Communicator's oratory, including the 40th anniversary of the UN, the Economic Bill of Rights, his first appearance after the assassination attempt and, best of all, the Evil Empire speech. To win it, remind the Backbencher where and when Ronald warned that \"regimes planted by bayonets do not take root\". Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. WELL, MAYBE ... As you won't read in the Daily Mail, not all Tories are in favour of a referendum on the devil d'Estaing's evil works. Back in 1993, John \"Cupcake\" Butterfill (Conservative, Bournemouth West) did his bit to defend John Major against the \"bastards\" by explaining why a referendum on Maastricht was such a very bad idea. \"I could not consent to the introduction into our national life of a device so alien to all our traditions as the referendum, which has only too often been the instrument of Nazism and Fascism,\" Cupcake wrote a decade ago in Forward!, adding: \"The most disturbing aspect of a referendum is, however, the extraordinary constitutional problems that it poses for democracies such as ours with an unwritten constitution.\" The Backbencher feels a catch-22 coming on, and will give way to the honourable member. In the meantime, Cupcake, is the Quiet Man right to demand a referendum? Yes or no? ... NOT There is more bad news for Cupcake on the European Schoolnet, a tool of Europhiliac propaganda available here. \"Should the European constitution be approved by a referendum?\" ask the Brussels bureaucrats. The Backbencher hopes all staff at No 10 will regard it as their duty to vote \"no\". Hurry, though - so far only 14% of voters agreed with Mr Blair. CASH FLOW Reckless indiscretion, the Backbencher can assure readers, is not confined to female lobby journalists. She is sad to report that hostilities have broken out between Tom Watson and fellow Midlands MP Bill \"Sterling\" Cash (Conservative, Stone). Readers may recall Tom's efforts to court the yoof vote with a foray - which he continues to insist was ironic - into street slang. Britain's Most Wired MP has now taken to posting thoughts and anecdotes on his weblog. But the West Bromwich East MP should know better than to repeat just anything he overhears on the 10.29 from Sandwell and Dudley. Particularly when it concerns Michael Ancram (who has, Bill confided to his mobile, \"absolutely no credibility on the European convention issue\") and Lord Saatchi (\"Who the hell does he think he is with this GBP25m campaign on the referendum?\"). Perhaps most embarrassingly, \"he kept trying to call someone called Greg Clark [the Tories' policy head] and insisted that he returns his calls as a matter of urgency\". Sterling was indignant. \"If people are listening in to other people's conversations - and in my view misinterpreting them - then I think that's a very great shame,\" he told the Mirror. Irked, Tom threatened to reveal more, but seemed to lose his nerve when the Times weighed in. \"I forgot to say that I'll be without blog access for the next few days,\" he warned readers on Saturday. \"Andy and Alex from my office will be posting updates if required. They're under strict instructions to take the sealed envelope out of the safe if Mr Cash decides to speak!\" MOVING ON Readers who subscribe to Jeremy Paxman's Newsnight emails should take note: Jeremy is getting bored. \"They are a fad,\" he told the Online Journalism Review. \"Of course, the attempt is to create a sense of community. But it is, largely, a one-way traffic. If these emails are to be done - and done honestly - then they need some time and effort. Whether they are a worthwhile use of a presenter's time is another question.\" Well, why not answer the question, Jeremy? BOOK OF THE WEEK Matthew Tempest recommends Mark Curtis's Web of Deceit: Britain's Real Role in the World. \"Historian Mark Curtis's new book sets out to track British foreign policy since 1945. His thesis is that - rather than a benevolent Blighty watching the sun set on its empire - in fact the UK has been almost as complicit as the US in promoting regime change, suppressing democratically elected governments and supporting brutal elite interests across the globe. \"And over 400 pages he proves the point pretty conclusively, with astounding chapters on Britain's overthrow of the governments of British Guyana and Iran, state-sponsored death camps in Kenya, and - most impressively of all - the Wilson government's depopulation of the island of Diego Garcia, now a closed US military base. \"Writing right up until March 2003, Curtis's chapters on the Iraq conflict, and on Israel, Chechnya and Kosovo may feel familiar to keen students of world affairs (although little of his analysis appears consistently in the mainstream media), but his documentary spadework on former Labour governments - those of Atlee and Wilson - are the triumph of this book. \"Although some of Curtis's sub-Chomskyan mannerisms and style may grate, this is an important corrective lens through which to view not just the recent attack on Iraq, but the past half-century of Foreign Office mendacity.\" * Matthew Tempest is Guardian Unlimited's political correspondent. Web of Deceit is available from Amazon.co.uk. MY FIRST VOTE This week, Alan Laing - until recently the campaign manager of the \"No\" national anti-euro campaign - is still uplifted by the spirit of 1997. \"My first vote was in that historic Labour landslide of May 1997. I helped with the campaign to elect the Labour candidate in the Stirling constituency up in Scotland. At the time, the seat was the base for Michael Forsyth, the then Scottish secretary. \"Before the election, I had organised separate talks to all of us in our final year by the candidates, given that we were all going to vote for the first time and had been involved in the Stirling CLP. \"I don't think many of us were aware of what was about to happen. I remember it was warm and sunny on polling day (amazingly for Scotland), and after voting myself, I stood outside my local polling station as one of the Labour scrutinisers. \"We all have our favourite moments, but the instant the announcement of 'Stirling - Lab Gain' appeared on the screen, there was a smile of pride that I had been part of this event, and had helped elect a Labour government - something that I had no memory of, only being born in 1978. \"I was interested before, but that night made politics and me inseparable. Since then, I have become more involved and I have now experienced winning an election as a candidate. People ask why I'm in politics and the answer is simple: because every now and then, you can actually do something that helps someone. That's what politics is about at the end of the day - isn't it?\" * Alan has now joined the PR consultancy Chelgate. In addition to his full-time job, he is the youngest Labour councillor in the London borough of Hackney.
