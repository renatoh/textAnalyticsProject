Davos has been busy tonight with meetings, nobnobbing, some exclusive private dinner, and plenty of armed police to deter anyone from sneaking around where they shouldn\u2019t. But before that all started, WEF\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, told delegates that they need to up their game and deliver responsive and responsible leadership (the theme of this year\u2019s Forum). Schwab said: \u201cResponsive means that we listen to and interact with those who have entrusted us with leadership. It is always important to prioritize the public social good over our own interests. We must emphasize humanization over robotization.\u201d Schwab is hoping that this week\u2019s meeting will find ways to reform capitalism and boost growth, adding: \u201cSometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. But we have to look in a confident way into the future.\u201d Full marks for optimism, after a year that has demolished the Davos world view. We\u2019ll find out this week if WEF can rise to the challenge.... Goodnight! GW Elsewhere in Davos, PricewaterhouseCoopers has reported that many bosses are losing faith in globalisation (a journey that many people took a while ago). My colleague Larry Elliott explains: Executives running the world\u2019s leading companies share public scepticism about the benefits of globalisation and doubt whether breaking down barriers to trade has helped tackle climate change or inequality. The annual health check of global boardrooms conducted by the consultancy firm PwC found the mood more upbeat than a year ago, despite the shockwaves caused in 2016 by the vote for Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election. But the survey, published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, found that the bullishness about the benefits of globalisation had diminished in the 19 years since PwC first polled executives at the end of the 1990s. Here\u2019s the full story: WEF\u2019s final Crystal Award goes to actor Forest Whitaker, for his work on conflict resolution in the developing world. The star of The Last King of Scotland explains that his Foundation helps young people to become the change they want to see in the world (hat-tip to Gandhi). These \u2018youth peacemakers\u2019 are working on the front line to achieve humanitarian breakthroughs. For example, in Uganda, former child soldiers are now setting up electronics shops and salons. In Mexico, they are leading skills-building sessions in prisons and tackling bullying in schools. And in one case (I missed the country, sorry), they even negotiated with an army occupying a school, persuading them to leave. Shakira, the Columbian performer and singer, also receives a Crystal Award from WEF for her humanitarian work. She talks about the crisis of child poverty in her country. Children who don\u2019t receive the food and stimulation they need, who aren\u2019t played with and read to, will never reach their full potential, she says. This means that being born into poverty means never getting out of it. In Columbia, there are 250 million children trapped in poverty -- that\u2019s almost the population of the United States. Today\u2019s babies will create tomorrow\u2019s businesses and solve tomorrow\u2019s problems; but those who are economically disadvantaged need more help to succeed and achieve their potential. Those with power, and money, cannot simply sit back and leave this to governments, she continues. Shakira says her Foundation has achieved \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d results by funding schools in the most remote parts of Columbia. Students responded academically \u2018so well\u2019, so that children who would have joined the guerillas are heading to university instead. Investment in education can create miracles -- it\u2019s a better feeling than winning a Grammy, she jokes. And she wants those at WEF to help provide more funding for ECD (early childhood development), and to \u2018invest in humans\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s the smart thing to do, the strategic thing to do, and the just thing to do.\u201d Over in the WEF congress hall, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter is receiving a crystal award from the Forum for her work helping young musicians. She says that music can play a role in making a better, more peaceful world as it has no ideology. Then she turns to the world\u2019s hunger crisis; 24 children have died through malnutrition in the last four minutes. Eight million people die from hunger each year; that\u2019s one every three seconds. She reminds the audience that the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals includes the total eradication of hunger by 2030. but not enough is being done. There\u2019s no shortage of talk, Mutter says pointedly, as: If one could eat resolutions and words, no-one would starve. Everyone in this audience can help, she concludes. You must ignore the sirens of ever greater wealth, and instead do more to protect the poor and the weak. Outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden is telling the World Economic Forum that he\u2019s optimistic that cancer can be beaten. On his final overseas trip as VP, Biden is updating Davos on the Cancer Moonshot - his effort to dramatically boost the fight against cancer. He says that the initiative has made real progress, by bolstering collaboration between research groups, doctor and drugs companies. Biden says there is an \u2018enormous\u2019 opportunity to build on this collaboration; he hopes that other countries will provide more support to help \u201cdouble-down\u201d on the battle. And Biden also hopes that his successor, Mike Pence, will continue this work. I\u2019ve already spoken to the vice-president elect who is a good man, about my willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration, to be as committed and enthusiastic as we are about the goal of ending cancer as we know it. My prayer is that they will do that as well. Whatever happens, Biden continues, those in the private sector, philanthropists, academics will continue to work together as there\u2019s just \u2018too much momentum\u2019, thanks to the improved collaboration between cancer centres, researchers, the government, etc. Biden insists that he\u2019s optimistic, thanks to the \u201cabsolute commitment and sheer brilliance\u201d of the researchers, scientists and institutions he\u2019s worked with. In time, more people will get the right cure first time, cancer prevention will be improved, and care will be personalised. \u201cThe one thing i can tell you, there\u2019s hope.\u201d Biden\u2019s son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015. And the VP ends his speech today by citing JFK\u2019s dream of putting a man on the moon: It was a moving speech, confirming that Biden\u2019s going to be missed. The Davos security people aren\u2019t taking any chances this year -- Bloomberg reports that they\u2019re carrying guns to shoot down any drones that approach WEF. Over in Davos, the 2017 World Economic Forum is now getting underway. The biggest global gathering of world leaders and business chiefs will be formally opened at 6.15pm Swiss time by Klaus Schwab, who founded WEF back in the 1970s. WEF will also award its traditional Crystal Awards, to violin Anne-Sophie Mutter, singer and performer Shakira and actor Forest Whitaker. That will tee up four days of meetings, speeches and behind-the scenes talk about issues like Donald Trump, Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, populism, climate change, artificial intelligence, and a lot more, under extra-tight security. Oxfam has the set the scene, with its warning that eight billionaires own as much net wealth as the poorest half of the country. And WEF itself is pushing for more inclusive, socially beneficial economic policies - having calculated that average incomes in many countries have shrank since 2008 (see earlier post). The pound has stabilised a little after its plunge to a three month low earlier in the day. But the fears of a hard Brexit, prompted by comments from the UK government ahead of prime minister Theresa May\u2019s speech on Tuesday, mean that sterling is still down around 1% against the dollar. It is currently down 0.8% at $1.2078 against the dollar and 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1384. But despite the boost to overseas earners from the weak pound, the FTSE 100 has fallen back from its record intra-day level and is now down 0.11% at 7327. If the index closes lower it will end an unprecedented winning streak, with 12 successive days of record closes and fourteen days of rises. Financial shares are leading the fallers, hit by worries that a hard Brexit would cause problems for their ability to operate in Europe in the future. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u2019s Davos gathering. The UK Treasury has welcomed the upgrade to its forecasts by the IMF. It said: The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, and today\u2019s IMF forecasts confirm their view that the UK was the fastest-growing major advanced economy last year. We have reduced the deficit by almost two thirds, cut taxes for millions of working people, and employment is at a near-record high. The Autumn Statement reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to return the public finances to balance as soon as practicable, while providing flexibility to support the economy as we exit the EU. Britain\u2019s business community has weighed into the Brexit debate ahead of an update by Theresa May on Tuesday: Britain risks a \u201cdisorderly crash landing\u201d if it assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks, business leaders have said, in a last-ditch plea for a negotiated settlement with Europe. As Theresa May prepares to reveal an uncompromising set of UK objectives on Tuesday, pressure is mounting on the prime minister to take a firm line with other member states and ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs if no deal can be agreed. But the CBI is calling on politicians to wake up to the limitations of the WTO and dangers of a disorderly or \u201ctrain crash\u201d Brexit, despite the long and painful concessions that may be necessary if the UK is to obtain a replacement free-trade agreement when it leaves the single market. \u201cThe practicalities of a disorderly crash-landing need to be understood,\u201d said Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cWe have had conversations with some of the proponents of just walking away and we will again talk to them about what we see from our members about the consequences of that. \u201cAn exit into WTO at the stroke of midnight without the proper planning and preparation in place would be very serious for the UK economy. There are some signs that there is more conversation around that being an outcome. Our job is to demonstrate how difficult that would be because of all of these unanswered questions.\u201d The full story is here: Ahead of Davos the International Monetary Fund has issued a new warning on the global economy. Katie Allen writes: The global economy faces a multitude of risks in 2017, ranging from rising protectionism spearheaded by Donald Trump to a severe slowdown in China, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The Washington-based fund used an update to its economic forecasts to highlight popular antipathy towards international trade and a widening in the gap between rich and poor. It called on governments to tackle inequality by helping people find work in fast-changing jobs markets shaken up by technology and globalisation. The IMF made no changes to its October forecast for global economic growth to edge up this year after a sluggish 2016. But it upgraded its outlook for the UK economy, bringing the IMF more in line with other forecasters following signs that the British economy grew at a solid pace in the second half of 2016, despite the Brexit vote. The UK outlook for 2018 was cut, however. The full story is here: Now over to Greece. The prospect of further instability in the eurozone is mounting as consternation grows over the inability of Greece and its creditors to complete a second bailout review of the debt-stricken economy. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Fears are growing in Greece and abroad over continued friction between Athens and its creditors. Prolonged foot dragging over completion of a second bailout review has triggered mounting speculation that the debt-stricken country could be headed for new polls if it fails to come to some accord with lenders. The prospect of the IMF not participating in the current programme - mooted last week by Germany\u2019s powerful finance minister Wolfgang Schauble who suggested the European Stability Mechanism could assume the role instead \u2013 may have elicited thinly disguised euphoria in Greece but has been met with angst elsewhere. Schauble also hinted that departure of the IMF could mean even stricter terms for Greece \u2013 in short, a fourth bailout programme for a country now in its eighth year of austerity-induced depression. This morning the ESM\u2019s managing director Klaus Regling highlighted concerns saying whatever happened the German Bundestag would have to ratify the move. Berlin is the biggest contributor of the three rescue programmes that since 2011 have kept Greek bankruptcy at bay and had originally said it would only continue disbursing funds if the IMF was on board. If the review\u2019s conclusion is delayed for much longer officials worry Greece will miss the next target: of getting Greek bonds included in the European Central Banks QE programme in March. All off which has put Athens\u2019 leftist led administration under additional pressure to come up with alternatives to the \u201cillogical\u201d demands it says the IMF is now making \u2013 starting with the body\u2019s insistence that it legislate further multi-year pension cuts and income-tax hikes worth \u20ac4.5bn to ensure that primary surplus targets are met. Speculation of euro exit is once again gaining currency despite fiscal adjustment and the immense sacrifices the country has already made. Amid talk of the drachma returning, the government has signalled it is now working on new proposals for lenders which it will present at the next euro group of euro area finance ministers on January 26. The World Economic Forum has also found that incomes across many advanced countries shrank since 2008; another sign that economic policies need to change. WEF\u2019s new report on economic inclusivity (see last post) shows that median income shrank by almost 2.5% between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available. And 51% of countries saw a decline in their inclusion score during the same period; driven by a surge in wealth inequality since the financial crisis. With public anger against the the political and economic establishment on the rise, WEF is urging politicians to do more to improve living standards, boosting quality of life and making people feel more secure. Richard Samans, a member of the Forum\u2019s Managing Board, argues: \u201cTo respond more effectively to social concerns, economic policy needs a new compass setting, broad-based progress in living standards, and a new mental map in which structural reform is reimagined and reapplied to this task, with chief economic advisers and finance ministers prioritizing it every bit as much their traditional focus on macroeconomic, financial supervisory and trade policy.\u201d We may hear more about this issue tonight, when Davos gets underway. Back in snowy Switzerland, a new report from the World Economic Forum makes rather dispiriting reading for the UK. Britain\u2019s wealth and gender inequality, generation gap and weak productivity growth mean it lags behind many rival advanced economies when it comes to economic inclusivity. That\u2019s according to WEF\u2019s \u201cInclusive Growth and Development Report 2017\u201d, which ranks Britain just 21th out of 30 fellow advanced economies. It\u2019s online here. The report, launched at Davos, looks at 12 performance measures that try to get deeper than simply measuring overall GDP. It found that the UK came 17th for \u2018growth and development\u2019, a section that covered GDP per person, labour productivity and life expectancy. The UK also came in the bottom half for \u2018inclusion;, which looked at how fairly income and wealth is distributed. WEF\u2019s Intergenerational equity index placed the UK in 23rd place, given the UK\u2019s high net debt (which must be paid off by future generations) and its dependency ratio (measuring the economic burden of pensioners and children on working people). Digging into the report shows that the UK scored well on other measures such as entrepreneurship (8th out of 30), the \u2018concentration of rents\u2019 (5th) and the tax code (where the UK was ranked top). But Britain was also ranked just 25 out of 30 on \u2018wage and non-wage compensation\u2019, dragged down by the gap in earnings between men and women, and the amount of pay swallowed up by childcare. Norway topped the charts, followed by Luxembourg, Sweden and Iceland. WEF\u2019s message is that politicians need to look beyond simple growth rates, and consider whether their economies are serving wider society. Otherwise, citizens are justified in turning to populist parties for answers. This recognition and the rebalancing of policy priorities it implies is what is required for governments to respond more effectively to decelerating growth and rising inequality \u2013 to take seriously the social frustrations increasingly being expressed through the ballot box and on the street. Such frustrations have an essential validity. The implicit income distribution system within many countries is in fact severely underperforming or relatively underdeveloped, but this is due to a lack of attention rather than an iron law of capitalism. The world economic recovery is still weak, according to China\u2019s president Xi Jinping. Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern before he heads off to Davos, he added that China would make its contribution to the recovery and his country\u2019s economy was peforming steadily overall. He said the country\u2019s GDP was expected to have grown by 6.7% in 2016, missing the 7% top end of the planned target range but still among the highest of major economies. More on the eurozone trade figures from IHS Markit chief economist Howard Archer: An improved traded good performance in November is supportive to belief that Eurozone GDP growth improved in the fourth quarter of 2016. While it is still questionable as to whether net trade contributed positively to fourth-quarter 2016 Eurozone GDP growth, November\u2019s improved trade performance at the very least dilutes the likelihood that net trade was an appreciable drag on activity. Net trade made a marginally negative contribution to Eurozone GDP growth in the third quarter, therefore being a factor limiting GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. In real terms, exports of goods and services edged up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter while imports rose by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth may well have improved to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 (from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters). It\u2019s a thin day for data but there have been some eurozone trade figures, showing an increase in the trade surplus: The European banking sector is also losing ground after agency DBRS cut Italy\u2019s credit rating on Friday, a move which could raise borrowing costs for the country\u2019s financial businesses. UBS said: The downgrade will impact haircuts applied to Italian govies [government bonds] used as collateral by banks in monetary policy operations with the ECB. Haircuts are calculated based on the best available rating for an issuer and DBRS had the last A rating on Italy (S&amp;P: BBB-, Moody\u2019s: Baa2, Fitch: BBB+). As a consequence and depending on the maturity of the Italian govies pledged, we estimate the downgrade could lead to the need for a 6-9% top-up of the govies used as collateral. The comments from Theresa May over the weekend are nothing new, says Berenberg. Its senior UK economist Kallum Pickering said: While UK prime minister Theresa May has previously stated that she doesn\u2019t recognise the concept of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 the market clearly does. Comments by May hinting at a hard Brexit sent the pound lower over the weekend. But is any of it new information? No, not really. May has stated on several occasions that she will prioritise regaining control of the UK\u2019s borders and laws over access to the single market. In May\u2019s speech tomorrow we expect her to reiterate the same message, again. While the prime minister hasn\u2019t gone so far as to plainly state the potential impacts of such an arrangement, her broad aims for post-EU Britain have been consistently clear for some time now. The commonly heard \u2018uncertainty\u2019 about May\u2019s intentions is hard to justify. Unless May does a complete U-turn from here, any hope of full single market access for post-EU Britain is more or less out of the question. We can presume also, given that May has gone to the effort of setting up a trade department, currently headed by MP Liam Fox, and has stated on a number of occasions that the UK should be able to strike its own trade deals independently of the EU, that an exit from the EU customs union is likely too. We do not expect May\u2019s speech to alter our base case by much, if at all. We currently expect the UK and EU27 to agree a deal in which the UK maintains a good level of access to the EU\u2019s goods markets and limited access to the less developed services markets. Crucially, we expect the UK to lose its EU financial services passport. This follows from the UK raising some modest barriers to migration from the EU. Which is one reason why, as we mentioned earlier, financial shares are coming under renewed pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays among the leading fallers. This in turn has seen the FTSE 100 come off its best levels, with the index currently around 4 points lower. Donald Trump\u2019s desire for a UK-US trade deal to be ready as soon as Britain leaves the EU came in an interview with Michael Gove, and is being covered by my colleague Andrew Sparrow in the politics live blog: Theresa May\u2019s speech on Brexit is not the only event which could influence the pound: The pound has come off its worst levels, but is still down more than 1% at $1.2041. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: After falling below the key 1.20 level on Sunday, [the pound] has since staged a comeback.... The was partly driven by comments from Donald Trump in an interview with The Times newspaper where he said that the UK was at the top of a list for a trade deal with the US, and that the UK did a great thing by leaving the EU. Other factors that have soothed the pound this morning include some reassurances from the UK Treasury that it will address investors concerns that may arise from Theresa May\u2019s speech on Tuesday. This \u201crecovery\u201d is also typical after a move below a key technical level such as 1.20 in the pound/dollar, and thus may only be temporary. Looking ahead, we think that the pound is likely to remain vulnerable, and, in the short term, the market could once again test the air below 1.20, and the lows from October\u2019s flash crash. Volatility levels in the pound/dollar as measured by the options market, have risen once again on Monday, taking the 1-month GBP/USD volatility level to a fresh 4-month high. This suggests that investors are expecting further large moves from the pound in the short term. Some have wondered why the foreign exchange market continues to be \u201cshocked\u201d by news about a hard Brexit, after all the UK\u2019s exit from the single market has always been on the cards and is not a new concept. I would argue that the \u2018Brexit theme as bad news for the pound\u2019 is such an ingrained trend at this stage that it really doesn\u2019t matter what May says or fails to say on Tuesday. Instead, it\u2019s all about market dynamics, and right now the balance of market participants are shorting the pound. It\u2019s a bit like a tipping point, once a trend gets critical mass, like the pound downtrend, then news headlines can have big impacts, as they generate another wave of selling. Ahead of the Davos gathering, the World Economic Forum warned on the risk of rising inequality, and here is more evidence. Larry Elliott writes: The world\u2019s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe\u2019s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth. In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was \u201cbeyond grotesque\u201d that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (\u00a3350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people. The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation. Larry\u2019s full report is here: With little in the way of economic or corporate news, and the US markets shut for Martin Luther King day, the fall in the pound is likely to dominate investor sentiment. No surprise given the influence of the weak pound on its overseas constituents, but the FTSE 100 has reached a new peak in early trading. The leading index is up 0.2% to an intra-day high of 7354, despite a fall in banking shares after Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on Royal Bank of Scotland from buy to neutral. The financial sector is also being undermined by worries about the repercussions of a hard Brexit on the City. Mining shares are dominating the risers, accounting for seven of the top ten best performers. Sterling could fall as low as $1.10 according to Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: Cable is now clinging to the $1.20 handle for dear life and seems to have steadied a little as trading commences in London \u2013 pound trading in Asia is often quite volatile because of thin liquidity. We\u2019ve also got the pound trading at its weakest level against the euro since November. It\u2019s looking more and more like a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit is in the offing and markets are responding. The currency market is the most efficient and swiftest to price it in. However the full effects of a hard Brexit are not yet completely discounted by the markets and so we could have further to run depending on what is said tomorrow. We now have to assume May will prioritise immigration controls and the price to pay will be to exit the single market. That could send the pound a lot lower still, perhaps towards $1.10 in the coming weeks. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the triggering of Article 50 is another risk factor that is likely to increase volatility in pound crosses. May probably won\u2019t give everything away and explain the government bargaining position in detail, but it looks like she will sound more hawkish and steer the tone towards a hard Brexit. The PM\u2019s statements have a habit of hitting sterling pretty hard and today\u2019s moves are clear signs of nervousness in the fx market. The PM could, however, strike a more soothing tone than markets expect and that could spark a significant short-term reversal in cable, although long-term it\u2019s going to be hard to shake the bears. Here\u2019s the pound\u2019s continuing decline: The pressure on the pound is only likely to get worse, with volatility increasing, according to economists at UniCredit: [We] believe that sterling is a sell on any potential rallies. Even in the event of a more \u201cconciliatory\u201d tone (by Mrs. May hinting at seeking out a transitional agreement with the European Union, for instance) the respite on sterling is very likely to be only temporary. As long as control over immigration remains the UK government\u2019s anchoring point, it is virtually impossible to envision anything other than an exit from the EU\u2019s single market. With the pound weaker, the FTSE 100 is indeed expected to hit new heights: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has come under renewed pressure ahead of a key speech by UK prime minister Theresa May on Tuesday, where she is expected to spell out Britain\u2019s negotiating strategy for Brexit talks. Investors fear that she will indicate the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, and a so-called hard Brexit will be on the cards. That has combined to send the pound down to its lowest levels since the flash crash of October last year. It fell as low as $1.1983 in Asian trading before recovering some ground. It is currently down 1.45% at $1.2002, while against the euro it has fallen 1.24% to \u20ac1.1312. The strength of the dollar is also hitting the pound, with investors still anxious to hear details of president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans to boost the US economy. But with the weak pound one of the driving forces behind the rise of the FTSE 100 to record levels, since it boosts the business of overseas earners, markets are expected to open higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The weakness of the pound has been one of the key catalysts as to why the FTSE100 has managed to push strongly above its previous all-time highs, as well managing to break record after record in closing higher every day since just before Christmas. This pattern looks set to continue again, with a higher open for the UK benchmark, as we head into a new week after the pound fell below the 1.2000 level for the first time since the flash crash lows in October last year in Asia overnight. It would appear that the main catalyst behind this sell-off is speculation that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will set out tomorrow the UK government\u2019s position when it comes to coming to deal with the EU with respect to its negotiation position ahead of the expected triggering of article 50 in March, though this could still be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling which is due any day now. The expectation is that the Prime Minister\u2019s insistence on being able to better control immigration as well as the UK\u2019s law making, will result in the UK announcing its intention to leave the single market and customs union, which most investors appear to assign as being exceedingly negative for the pound. Elsewhere it is a fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but later the annual jamboree in Davos begins, with full coverage in the blog by my colleague Graeme Wearden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
