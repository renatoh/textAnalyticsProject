In a speech to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, the prime minister admitted \"we are far from persuading those we need to persuade\" that western values were even-handed, fair and just in their application. He said there was no point disguising the damage being done to the cause of peace in the Middle East by the war on the Lebanese border, but suggested that when the war finally ended \"we must commit ourselves to a complete renaissance of our strategy to defeat those that threaten us\". Mr Blair said it was necessary \"to change dramatically the focus of our policy\", admitting: \"In the short term we are not winning.\" He added that even in the west \"a vast part of opinion is not remotely near understanding\" that the battles in Iraq and Lebanon are \"part of a wider struggle for the soul of the Middle East\". The only way to defeat the \"arc of extremism stretching across the Middle East\", he said, was to build an \"alliance of moderation\" that \"paints a different future\" in which people of all faiths can live together. He added: \"We will not win the battle against this global extremism unless we win it at the level of values as much as force and unless we show we are even-handed, fair and just in our application of those values to the world. \"Unless we reappraise our strategy, unless we revitalise the broader global agenda on poverty, climate change, trade and, in respect of the Middle East, bend every sinew of our will to making peace between Israel and Palestine, we will not win, and this is a battle we must win.\" Mr Blair said the conflict in the Middle East and beyond was \"in part a struggle between what I call reactionary Islam and moderate mainstream Islam, but its implications go far wider. We are fighting a war - but not just against terrorism, but about how the world should govern itself in the early 21st century, about global values.\" He also said the battle in Lebanon had been started by Hizbullah provocation, and was intended \"to create chaos, division and bloodshed and to provoke retaliation by Israel that would lead to Arab and Muslim opinion being inflamed, not against those who started the aggression, but those who responded to it\". His spokesman refused to comment on reports that the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, had urged him to back an unconditional ceasefire, and pointed out that Germany, the Czechs and the Poles were all backing the British position of setting the terms for cessation of hostilities first. But his aides admitted he regretted that a sustained effort for a political settlement in the Middle East had been allowed to slide. Mr Blair also argued that the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were not to secure \"regime change, but values change\". \"We could have chosen security as the battleground. But we didn't. We chose values. We said we didn't want another Taliban or a different Saddam. Rightly, in my view, we realised that you can't defeat a fanatical ideology just by imprisoning or killing its leaders; you have to defeat its ideas.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
