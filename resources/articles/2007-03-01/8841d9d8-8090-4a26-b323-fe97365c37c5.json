As the Fonz from Happy Days might say, it's not all that \"Ayyyy\". Where then, is the careers advice that can get you snapping your fingers and shuffling your feet? The kind that'll have you standing on the tables doing the Watusi or the Twist until the early hours? You might think that such a thing doesn't exist, but that would be to overlook the reams of job and workplace guidance inserted into songs. Perhaps because of the boring reputation of such advice, most musicians have felt the need to hide their guidance in-between the lines - but with careful research a veritable treasure trove of pearls can be gleaned from lyrics. Here then is the chart compilation of the best careers advice in songs ... ever! It is the only guidance that you'll be humming all day. T'Ain't What You Do (It's the Way that You Do It) Although originally a jazz standard written in 1939 and recorded by bandleader Sy Oliver, the 1982 version by Bananarama and the Fun Boy Three is probably the better known. Even so, it contains an absolute gem of careers advice. Over the course of the song the three factors that anyone searching for career nirvana (the blissful state, not the grunge band) are revealed: it isn't what you do, the song claims, it's simply the way, the time and the place in which you do it. Combined, the song promises, these factors will return \"results\". A simple case study easily proves this hypothesis. Who do you think would be more successful, a butcher who operated in a well-lit butcher's shop during the day, or a butcher who worked secretively in a ditch at night? Clearly, the song's trinity of elements - way, time and place - is the key to success, and anyone whose career is faltering should run through this checklist - providing that they want results, of course. Get a Job (Sha-na-na-na, sha-na-na-na-na) There is a heated debate among career musicologists about whether the rest of the Silhouettes' lyric is applicable to the career search plan. Some argue that the \"Yip-yip-yip-yip-yip-yip-yip-yip ... Mum-mum-mum-mum-mum-mum\" represents the tenacity a job-hunter needs. Others, however, counter that this line is just meaningless scat designed to pad out the lyrics. Regardless, the song's original point, namely that you should get a job, is an essential step towards career happiness, as research has shown that without employment the chances of having a successful career are slim. Other elements of this song have dated quite badly. For example, the line detailing the protagonist's career search strategy (checking wanted ads in the newspaper, being shouted at by his partner) should be considered woefully insufficient in the modern era of job websites, email alerts, speculative applications and job fairs - all techniques that current job hunters should be yip-yipping about. The Skills to Pay the Bills With their trademark lyrical excellence, the Beastie Boys cut to the heart of one of the greatest problems facing a job hunter: what transferable skills should I highlight on my CV? This is an area with many pitfalls, as Mike D notes in the first verse: \"You Rip Van Winkle now you better wake up, MCs pick up a hobby that you're gonna take up.\" His point is crystal clear, think long and hard before filling in the Interests and Activities section of your CV. There is one point that all of the rappers agree on, the skills you need to give greatest weight to are those that are capable of \"makin' money\". Simply put, the Beastie Boys' advice is that you should give greatest focus to your commercially applicable qualities - an employer will want to see evidence of business skills that are capable of paying their business bills if you are to get a job. Let's Work It seems incredible that it took Prince until his fourth album, 1981's Controversy, to get around to covering the issue of workplace motivation. However, when he eventually did cover the subject he did so comprehensively. The song, Let's Work, tells the story of how an employer has noticed one of his employees lacking motivation - \"I've had my eyes on U ever since U walked into the room,\" says the boss, who can see the worker's potential but doesn't believe that it's being tapped. The boss's plaintive cry of \"I wanna see U work, come on!\" will no doubt ring true to anyone who has attempted to motivate someone whose heart is not in the job. Finally, he has to take the employee back to basics. \"If I could get U in the raw,\" posits the boss, \"I'd make U climb the walls.\" Literally, the employee's productivity would be incredible if the boss could just take the employee back to the state he or she was in when he or she initially joined the company. The solution is simple: \"Let's have some fun!\" Perhaps if the team let their hair down then they will feel less animosity towards the company. Prince's advice is sound: a happy worker is a good worker. Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money) This Pet Shop Boys' track is a timely lesson in how to go about the tricky task of selecting a business partner. \"I've got the brains, you've got the look ... You've got the brawn, I've got the brains,\" sings Neil Tennant, hitting upon a winning formula. By selecting workers with complementary skills the singer hopes to achieve the aim of his business plan - making lots of money. This is excellent advice and others seeking business partners would do well to find someone who has different skills to their own. Unfortunately, one of the skills that Tennant identifies is not really suitable for a business environment - while intelligence is certainly a key skill, a good bone structure and brute strength are not directly applicable in an office. Brawn maybe useful for changing water-cooler bottles and moving the desks in an office reorganisation, but it will be the brains in the partnership doing the actual business work. In this respect, a better lyric might be: \"I've got the brains, you've got the human resources training required to keep our employee recruitment within legal boundaries. So, let's make lots of money.\" Take This Job and Shove It It's a fact of our working lives that we all need to know when to quit. Johnny Paycheck's song lists several circumstances when resigning might be the best course of action. He cites a change in personal circumstances (\"my woman done left\"); difficulties with the management (\"the foreman is a regular SOB\"); and his advice is for employees to simply state: \"I ain't working here no more.\" While this is a fine and, no doubt, satisfying sentiment, immediately terminating your employment by instructing your manager to take their job and shove it, risks breaching your contract of employment. It would be wise to temper Paycheck's advice with that of another musician, MC Hammer (see below). Too Legit to Quit He of the extraordinary pantaloons is cannier than Paycheck in his resignation advice in this ditty from 1991. By advising that employees should be \"too legit to quit\", what Hammer is literally saying is that workers should keep employment legislation in mind at all times and observe a traditional notice period. MC Hammer boasts that this strategy of adhering to the legalities has served him well because now he is, \"leading the way and yeah I'm havin' a fit, kickin' it at the top because I'm too legit to quit.\" Sound words of advice for any worker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
