Was it, we wondered, a transmission problem. Or, with their need for speed sated after winning the chequered flag in 2013, had the Roosters become content to toddle along like some Camry driver with a sensible wide-brimmed hat on the rear dash? Who knows for sure, but it may now be moot considering how dynamic the Roosters were in flying past the hugely disappointing New Zealand Warriors 46-12. All the zip and hunger they\u2019ve been lacking so often this year was suddenly evident, and in just 80 minutes \u2013 time enough for eight tries and even a couple of bombed ones \u2013 the big and powerful Roosters, benefitting from Jake Friend\u2019s return at hooker, reminded us that not only are they able to defend their title, they may indeed be willing. The Warriors, however, played their part in making the Roosters look good. Despite fine conditions, almost 20,000 expectant fans in Mt Smart Stadium, and so much to play for, New Zealand, who had plenty of possession and enjoyed the benefit of an 11-4 penalty count, showed little imagination, and less desire, to crack the Roosters\u2019 stonewall defence. Too often, even with Shaun Johnson back in the team, the Warriors had to resort to the bomb, rugby league\u2019s version of throwing your hands in the air and saying \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea\u201d. Worse, their defensive line was too easily breached; both out wide, where Daniel Tupou, Michael Jennings, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Shaun Kenny-Dowall cut them up, and on the fringes of the ruck, where Boyd Cordner, running off James Maloney, galloped free. The Warriors have now slipped out of the top eight and their finals hopes are no longer in their own hands. Looks like another Warriors season ending with a long sigh. Cowboys upset the apple cart Manly\u2019s loss to Parramatta on Friday night opened the door for South Sydney to beat North Queensland and move into pole position for the minor premiership. But at no point did the Cowboys, who are narrating their own fairytale, look like obliging the Rabbitohs. No longer needing to breathe into paper bags whenever they\u2019re away from Townsville, the Cowboys were always in control of the match and their 33/35 completion rate (94%) gave Souths nothing. Indeed, Paul Green should get a copy of the game stats, laminate them and keep them in his wallet to cheer himself up for any sad times down the track. Inevitably Johnathan Thurston was the architect of the Cowboys\u2019 win, but the pack deserves the credit for not only standing up to Souths\u2019 giants, who have scattered all before them this season, but for beating them at their own game. Matt Scott, Ashton Sims and James Taumalolo were immense. The Cowboys had a bit of luck with the referees disallowing a likely looking try to Luke Keary, but the Cowboys more than earned the win. And on this kind of form they can win the premiership. Of course they\u2019ll need to make the eight first. Such is the logjam between sixth and 11th that a single slip-up could prove costly. Parra party like it\u2019s 2009 It\u2019s always worth remembering \u2013 not that their fans would ever forget \u2013 that Parramatta entered 2014 having \u2018won\u2019 the past two wooden spoons. Last year, under the stewardship of Ricky Stuart, they did it in some style. With blood spilled in the dressing room, and tears in the stands, the Eels won just five games in tallying up a negative 414 points differential. In that context, merely finishing this season with their pants on would have been progress. But with just two rounds to go in the regular season Brad Arthur\u2019s Parramatta are sitting clear in eighth. On Friday night their late-season revival continued when they upset the ladder-leading Manly at Pirtek Stadium. Feeding off a big home crowd (thank goodness the match wasn\u2019t at the ANZ where the 18,000 fans would have all but disappeared), the Eels honoured the atmosphere with an intense performance and the composure to come from 12-0 down at the break. A loss would have all but ended their season so it took some maturity to avoid panicking and much of the credit for that has to go to Chris Sandow who, like his team, has come from a pretty dark place to take his place in the sun today. The Eels still have much to do to get over the line, and their negative 60 points differential leaves them vulnerable, but whatever happens now 2014 has been a success. The Dogs have done enough, the Tigers have had enough While the Wests Tigers\u2019 season has turned into a snuff film (That\u2019s 198 points conceded in the past five games! Cover your eyes, kids!) Canterbury\u2019s has received the paddles of life and they\u2019ve a pulse yet again. Two weeks ago the Dogs were in danger of undoing all their good early-season form and surrendering to the tough times they\u2019d found themselves in. You wouldn\u2019t exactly say they\u2019re flying again, but they\u2019ve done enough over the past two weeks to get back in the winners\u2019 circle, and on Thursday night they even had the luxury of putting the cue in the rack early in the second half. As coach Des Hasler hinted, this had much to do with keeping their powder dry for their match against Souths next week, a game upon which their top four aspirations rely. The Sharks are the NRL\u2019s biggest loser Given the year they\u2019ve had, given the past few days they\u2019ve endured, it\u2019s fitting that Cronulla\u2019s year will now surely end with them finishing last. In the same week that 12 current and former Sharks players, including captain Paul Gallen, accepted suspensions for taking prohibited substances, the under-strength Sharks showed against an Anthony Milford-inspired Canberra that when it comes to the biggest losers in the NRL they take the cake. The depressing thing for Sharks fans is that it\u2019s not over yet. Nor is it likely to be in two weeks when the Sharks\u2019 season officially ends. It remains to be seen whether any of the players caught up in the Asada scandal will sue the club (and this is not a club that has money to spare), while the fate of sidelined coach Shane Flanagan has yet to be decided. Hard to believe, but the Sharks may have not yet hit rock bottom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
