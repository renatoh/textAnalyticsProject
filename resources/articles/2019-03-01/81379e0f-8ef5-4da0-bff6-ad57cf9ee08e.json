Less than a mile up the road, on the 13th floor of the European commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters, a dinner hosted by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and attended by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and Sir Tim Barrow, Britain\u2019s ambassador to the EU, had come to a close. And things had not gone well. As the British party arrived back at the ambassador\u2019s residence, and the last of the guests disappeared into the night, attempts were made to craft a press statement, in cooperation with commission officials, that might express some optimism about the continuing negotiations, but without offering up hostages to fortune. But the words could not be found. It was not until the next morning, as he sought to escape Brussels on the Eurostar, that Cox, relatively fresh to these kind of negotiations but now central to their success, conceded as to the state of play. \u201cStrong views\u201d had been expressed and \u201crobust\u201d discussions had taken place at the pre-dinner talks attended by a wider group and over the more intimate meal of tuna, cod and chocolate fondant, the government\u2019s chief legal adviser admitted. It was diplomatic code to describe heated arguments and \u2013 yet again \u2013 no breakthrough. With just days to go before the prime minister was due to put her Brexit deal back to the Commons, in the hope of overcoming the historic 230-vote loss in January, the \u201clegally binding\u201d changes to the Northern Ireland backstop promised to MPs by Theresa May appeared far from sight. By this weekend, after Barnier rejected the prime minister\u2019s appeal for a \u201clast push\u201d by the EU in the talks, hopes of agreement seemed dimmer than ever. All he could offer was some reassuring legal language about the temporary nature of the backstop, an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland if no trade deal emerges. \u201cThe gap is very wide,\u201d EU sources said. \u201cIt feels very gloomy.\u201d In Downing Street, May\u2019s officials were trying all last week to give the impression that all was not lost and that the prime minister could still win on 12 March. they were still holding to the line. \u201cThere is no point in pretending that it has not been a difficult week,\u201d said one No 10 insider. \u201cBut we could still have a deal. Things could turn very quickly.\u201d Despite Cox\u2019s largely fruitless travels, talks are continuing \u201cat all levels\u201d this weekend in the hope that new wording on the Irish backstop can be agreed before Tuesday that will win over the DUP and enough Tory MPs. But the more conciliatory noises that were heard from hardline Tory sceptics 10 days ago have, as the days have passed, been replaced by eerie silence. And as the mood in the government and Tory party has darkened, cabinet ministers have become increasingly desperate. On5 March a grim chief whip, Julian Smith, told the cabinet that if May were defeated in the vote this coming Tuesday her government could lose control of events. \u201cParliament will try to force the government into a customs union by taking control of the order paper and having indicative votes [on a range of alternatives to the May deal],\u201d he said. All options have had to be considered behind closed doors \u2013 including those that ministers have publicly insisted would be completely unacceptable, such as a second Brexit referendum. On 7 March at lunchtime Barclay called in the two Labour MPs \u2013 Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson \u2013 who are planning to table an amendment which would allow May\u2019s deal to pass on the condition it is then put to the people in a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d referendum, with the other option being to remain in the EU. They talked for at least 45 minutes. While Barclay gave no indication that the government may throw its weight behind the plan, Kyle said the Brexit secretary was very engaged. The question the two Labour MPs asked themselves afterwards was why Barclay would spend his time with them if the government were not now considering all options, including their idea? Before the spring statement on the economy on 13 March, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, attempted to swing rebels behind May\u2019s deal, telling the Financial Times that, if it got through parliament, he could then splash the cash and start spending an \u201cinsurance fund\u201d built up to protect the country against a hard Brexit. But there is a sense that it may be too late for a breakthrough or a Plan B \u2013 and that any solution that does emerge will come about less by careful calculation, and more out of desperation and fear of disaster at the very last minute. Few expect to hear anything more than insubstantial assurances from Brussels and London on the backstop before Tuesday\u2019s vote. \u201cI really think Geoffrey Cox \u2013 nice guy and good intentions, yes \u2013 has achieved nothing at all,\u201d said one senior Tory MP opposed to May\u2019s deal. If there is a plan for what to do after a defeat on Tuesday, it could well be just more of the same. No 10 insiders concede that May \u2013 if and when she loses again (and even if MPs rule out no-deal on Wednesday and vote for a delay to Brexit on Thursday) \u2013 could try to resubmit her deal to parliament yet again, perhaps as late as just a few days before Brexit day on 29 March. \u201cI\u2019m not being drawn on that,\u201d said a source close to May. Meanwhile, the atmosphere between Brussels and London was hardly improved by comments on by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the EU would not be forgiven if it failed to give more ground. \u201cFrankly I think future generations, if this ends in acrimony, will say the EU got this moment wrong. And I really hope they don\u2019t.\u201d The reaction in Brussels and EU capitals was more dismay. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, countered by saying what was needed \u201cwas a change of approach by the UK government to understand that Brexit is a problem of their own creation\u201d. No 10 is still putting what faith it has left in Cox. But for all the attorney general\u2019s hard work and bonhomie, the European commission\u2019s negotiating team has privately offered very critical assessments of Cox\u2019s style and approach, having felt patronised during recent meetings. Others on the EU team suggested that Cox needed to be educated on European law during his visits to Brussels. \u201cHe is a man gifted with a lot of specialist knowledge of UK criminal law and a penchant for rhetoric,\u201d said one diplomat. \u201cUnfortunately the Germans share no such penchant.\u201d With 19 days to go until Britain is due to leave the EU, and two days before May puts her deal to parliament for another vote that few believe she can win, the problems are essentially the same as they have always been in Britain\u2019s troubled relations with the Europeans. As one Tory MP who has been involved in trying to find solutions put it: \u201cWe are just days away now from exit, and I can honestly say I am more pessimistic about resolving this in a satisfactory way than I have ever been.\u201d Six key questions on the eve of (another) final Commons vote There are 19 days left until Britain is due to leave the EU. On Tuesday, Theresa May will put her Brexit deal to the House of Commons, again. In January it was rejected by 432 votes to 202 \u2013 the biggest defeat for a prime minister in modern times, with 118 Tory MPs voting against. A week ago, many Tory MPs believed May might secure enough concessions from Brussels over the Irish backstop to persuade them to change their votes. Today it appears there has been limited progress in talks with the EU, and the prime minister could struggle to avoid defeat again. What could the next few days therefore mean for May, for Brexit - and the country? Can May\u2019s deal triumph on Tuesday? Yes. But only if the EU offers up last-minute concessions on the Irish backstop. Many Tory MPs and the 10 Democratic Unionist party\u2019s MPs want guarantees that the UK cannot permanently become trapped in a customs union with the EU. If the DUP moves, many Conservatives will follow. But as yet there is no sign that talks between the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox and Brussels have yielded anything substantial. If the deal is defeated again, surely that must be the end of it? No. May could try yet again to wring more concessions from the EU and bring the vote back again nearer to Brexit day. But the patience of MPs is wearing thin. Brussels and EU leaders say their doors are open\u2026 but only if the UK government puts forward new ideas. Are there any other Brexit options in play? Yes. If May is defeated, one option would be to go for what is known as \u201cNorway-plus\u201d. This \u201csoft Brexit\u201d option would mean staying inside the single market and having a customs arrangement with the EU that would solve the Irish border problem. It appeals to many Tory and Labour MPs, but hardline Brexiters see it as \u201cmembership lite\u201d. Europhiles say it would be the worst of all worlds \u2013 as the UK would be partly in the EU, but without much clout. The option of leaving with no deal is still in play, though May has said that if she loses on Tuesday she will table a vote the next day on whether to rule out no deal. If the vote happens, MPs are likely to vote to rule out no deal, though that will not be binding on the prime minister. Could Brexit be delayed? Yes. May could even back a delay herself, if she were defeated again. She has said that, were she to lose on Tuesday, she would table a vote on Thursday on whether Brexit should be delayed. Like Wednesday\u2019s vote, it is likely to pass if she has lost; however, also like Wednesday\u2019s vote, it will be non-binding. The EU insists it will only agree an extension of a few months if the UK is clear why it wants one. If the reason given for asking for a delay is to hold a general election or a second referendum, Brussels would probably agree. But May does not want either. Alternatively, she could \u2013 closer to Brexit day \u2013 use the threat of a much longer delay, perhaps of up to two years, in a final effort to force hardliners into line to back her deal. Could there still be another referendum? Yes. Labour is now in favour, if all else fails. But there is not yet a majority for the idea in parliament. Those backing another public vote say a majority would probably only be found if and when all other options had failed to win enough parliamentary support. Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson are planning to table an amendment (although not this week) that would allow May\u2019s deal to pass, subject to another referendum in which the public would choose between her deal and Remain. Why are people talking about a general election? While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act makes it difficult for the opposition to force an election early, one may become the only viable option if the government disintegrates over Brexit. Some Tories speculate that May might herself try to trigger a new election as a last resort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
