In the immediate aftermath of the match at the Etihad, in which Manchester United beat rivals City 2-1, former player turned pundit Gary Neville blamed politicians including Boris Johnson for creating a climate where racism was more acceptable. Sky\u2019s cameras appeared to show a home fan making monkey chants directed towards Manchester United\u2019s Brazilian midfielder Fred during the second half of the match in a clip that quickly went viral on social media. The player said on Sunday that the incident demonstrated that we were living in a \u201cbackward society\u201d. The man has been named in reports as Anthony Burke, who, according to his since-removed Facebook page, works for the construction company Kier Group. In now-deleted posts on his Facebook page, Burke denied that he was racist. Having tweeted on Saturday evening to say it was aware of the video, Kier announced on Sunday that an employee had been suspended. \u201cKier has a zero-tolerance policy towards any racist and discriminatory behaviour. We can confirm an employee has been suspended pending an investigation,\u201d said the company in a statement on Twitter. Earlier the same day a referee was forced to halt a League Two match at Forest Green Rovers\u2019 stadium midway through the second half after reports of a racist comment directed towards Scunthorpe defender Jordan Clarke. There has been a string of events in recent months that have underlined the persistence of racism in football. Piara Powar, executive director of Fare network, which works against discrimination in football, condemned the incident but said it was unsurprising. \u201cThere is a contagion,\u201d said Powar. \u201cThis is happening everywhere unquestionably because of a few things. One of those is mimicry \u2013 people are seeing others doing it and they think that they can follow and it\u2019s legitimate to do it.\u201d He added that the idea of clubs facing sanctions if incidents of racial abuse committed by their fans were frequent should be debated. \u201cI think focusing on an individual is a good way to make that individual accountable, but sometimes we need to look wider than that and frame people as a collective.\u201d Speaking on Sky in the aftermath of the Manchester derby, Neville linked Boris Johnson\u2019s rhetoric on immigration during election campaigning with the number of racist incidents in British society and sport. \u201cYou are watching the prime minister\u2019s debate where he is talking about migration to this country and people having to have certain levels. It fuels it all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has got worse over the last few years in this country and not just in football.\u201d He suggested English football has a greater responsibility after Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team were racially abused in Bulgaria this year. \u201cWe always judge other countries on how they deal with racism but we are poor with dealing with it ourselves,\u201d he said. Powar, whose organisation works with Uefa to monitor racism across Europe, agreed with Neville. \u201cThere are things being said within a political domain that four or five years ago were just not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Boris Johnson and his well-known comments about Africans or Muslim women wearing burqas, or whether it\u2019s the National Front in France. The poisonous discourse is everywhere. What is said by politicians is followed up by the media, some of whom give it legitimacy.\u201d Greater Manchester police said a 41-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and remained in custody on Sunday for questioning. Supt Chris Hill of the City of Manchester division said the force was taking the matter extremely seriously. \u201cRacism of any kind has no place in football or our society\u201d, he said. \u201cWe will continue to work with Manchester City and Manchester United football clubs on this incident and will investigate any other lines of enquiries.\u201d Manchester City said that it operated a zero tolerance policy and anyone found guilty of racist abuse would be banned for life. As United prepared to take a corner, Fred also appeared to have been hit by a cigarette lighter hurled from the crowd. \u201cFred and Jesse [Lingard] were in the corner, taking a corner, and I\u2019ve seen the video, heard from the boys,\u201d said the team\u2019s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cWe keep talking about it every bloody week. But he\u2019s been caught on camera. He should in my opinion never be allowed into a football ground again. Unacceptable.\u201d It is understood that the team reported the incident to City and referee Anthony Taylor, with more than one player feeling they had been subjected to racist abuse. The Football Association will also launch an investigation and will speak to Taylor, the clubs, the police and other relevant parties. In a statement, the Premier League said it would not tolerate discrimination in any form and that racism was not welcome at games. Fred said the alleged abuse showed that we were still living \u201cin a backward society\u201d. \u201cOn the field, I didn\u2019t see anything. I saw it only in the locker room afterwards,\u201d he told ESPN Brazil. \u201cUnfortunately, this is happening in some stadiums. It happened here, it happened in Ukraine with some friends. It\u2019s sad, but we have to keep our heads up and forget about that. \u201cWe are all the same regardless of skin colour, hair and gender. We came from the same place and we all go to the same place when it\u2019s all said and done. Thank God I have a lot of friends here in the locker room who hugged me, like Lingard. I don\u2019t want to think about it. I just want to move on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
