Last week, it was another turn for the government, which unveiled an \"action plan\" aimed at propelling charities, community groups and social enterprises into the \"heart\" of public services provision. The message was a familiar one, bordering on cliche. The third sector, we heard, fizzes with energy, creativity, innovation, commitment, experience and street credibility. There is some truth in this: these are qualities that the winners of the Guardian's Charity Awards, for example, demonstrate in abundance (see pages 8-9). It is easy to see how ministers, jaded by years of what they see as fruitless wrestling over reform with huge, entrenched public sector interests are captivated by the dynamism and moral clarity of successful, small, third sector organisations. The challenge has always been how to translate that energy and creativity onto a bigger scale - to ensure that the creative DNA of enterprises that start tiny and locally, addressing community-specific unmet needs, can be replicated and nurtured in other communities, by different people. The action plan is, if nothing else, a huge investment in the idea that it can be done - and in some hefty and important areas, from offender management to children's services. The third sector seems pleased with the plan. Ministers have certainly listened carefully to it. They recognise the big barriers in the way of those third sector providers that want to play a bigger role in the provision of public services - poor commissioning, lack of stable funding arrangements, and under-capacity - and come up with a compendium of solutions, including training courses for commissioners to appreciate the value of third \u00b7 sector providers, minimum three-year contracts for providers to ensure financial stability, and the establishment of a fund to ease the transfer of assets, such as community centres, from the state to third sector organisations. And yet the plan betrays a kind of excessive faith in the transformational powers of the third sector. Take the plan's intriguing idea that the third sector should not merely provide services but help design them too - this from a government supposedly in ideological thrall to the purchaser-provider split. Imagine the uproar if ministers declared that private providers - Capita or Group 4 Securicor, say - should help set the terms of the service they intend to provide. But that's not all. The plan also envisages a stronger input into public services by user-led organisations. In theory, this allows the possibility that the same charity might help design a service, run the service contract, monitor service quality through its user groups, and (through its campaigning arm) attack the local authority that let the contract . The plan argues that such close engagement between users and providers and commissioners can be positive, in the spirit of \"co-production\". This is true. But it also requires deft management skills, and even supporters of the third sector admit to serious concerns about its leadership capacity and the relatively underdeveloped nature of its governance and accountability arrangements. Ministers should not underestimate the resistance of statutory authorities to the third sector (service contracts at local level are the stuff of real politics: job losses, personal feuds, professional rivalry, turf wars, and budget squeezes). Nor should they overestimate the capacity and desire of the third sector to seize the opportunities ministers are so eager to present them with. The third sector, meanwhile, will do well not to be swept off its feet by such incontinent flattery. This is a government in a desperate hurry to inject what it sees as the magical healing properties of the voluntary sector into ailing public services. But beware: there are no quick fixes. \u00b7 Patrick Butler is editor of Society Guardian.
