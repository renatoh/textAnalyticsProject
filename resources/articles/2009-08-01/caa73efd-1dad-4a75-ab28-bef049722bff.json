Against all modern practice, these have become key games for the national team. Gone are the days when it felt almost gauche to pay attention to such exercises. With the exception of the extraordinary rout of the World Cup qualifier with Croatia in Zagreb, these have been the truly instructive fixtures. Challenges are sought. Following losses against France and Spain, the manager has now taken his squad to meet Holland, the first European side to clinch its place in South Africa next summer. Capello was sufficiently in earnest when the prior defeats were mentioned to point out, with good humour, that Germany had been overcome in Berlin. Proceedings in the Olympic stadium that night was an expression of the manager's stance. England, having led, conceded an equaliser and on many another evening a gentle current of indifference would had the match bobbing gently towards a draw. Instead, the urgency grew and John Terry's late goal delivered the win. That outcome may have no direct bearing on anything that occurs at a World Cup for which England have all but qualified. It did, all the same, send out the impression of a developing hardiness. These occasions can also have a profound impact that is not at all reassuring. The experience of being outclassed by Spain in Seville six months ago left the squad feeling sheepish, but it had its value. \"We probably thought we were one of the best teams in the world,\" Terry said of the attitude prior to kick-off. \"Actually, that showed us where we want to be.\" The suggestion that Spain's level of technique is attainable may be hopelessly optimistic, but Capello appears to have implanted both an understanding of the team's defects while also encouraging a faith that they can be overcome by next summer. There are also humdrum experiences to be utilised. The manager is no more immune to annoyances than his predecessors, especially in the approach to a new club season. Steven Gerrard pulled out of the match in the Amsterdam Arena because of a groin strain and his place is to go to Ashley Young. It will be the Aston Villa player's first start for England. Gerrard had been prospering for his country in an inside-left position, but Young is more accustomed to the wing. With that in mind, Frank Lampard might be more ready to advance from his current station beside Gareth Barry in defensive midfield. It will be informative this evening to learn, in addition, if Capello is as solicitous towards the feelings of club managers as his predecessors Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson normally were. With the Premier League re-opening for business at the weekend, Martin O'Neill would be disturbed on Aston Villa's behalf by any prospect of risks being taken with Emile Heskey. The target man is affected by an achilles injury that has become a common complaint for him, but he still trained normally last night, and Carlton Cole may start on the bench. Theo Walcott, who injured his side in Arsenal's friendly with Valencia last week, may well be among the substitutes. That would grant David Beckham a third start under Capello. The former captain has every reason to make a good impression. Capello is understandably concerned with status of a squad member who will be 35 at the time of the World Cup finals. The manager has reiterated that Beckham must find a move on loan from LA Galaxy to European club, as he did with Milan last season, when the MLS closes down during the winter. It would be wise, in addition, for the player to illustrate his worth in Amsterdam tonight. The environment, according to Capello, will be taxing. \"It is interesting,\" he said, \"to play Holland because they are third in the Fifa rankings and play a different type of football. They play more like Spain, even if they don't have quite the same quality. With Spain there is more dribbling and more offensive football but Holland are still really good.\" This generation of Dutchmen may not bear all that much resemblance to the side of the 'total football' era in the 1970s, but the coach Bert van Marwijk is well-stocked with sophisticates. The England defence can anticipate as severe a work-out as any section of the team. Glen Johnson will see a difference from the last six starts under Capello. Even when he took part in that loss to Spain, he was not subject to quite as direct as threat as he will be if Arjen Robben is coming down his flank. Capello may understand far more about Johnson's defensive capacities before the night is over. Van Marwijk, too has strikers such as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has switched from Real Madrid to Milan, to assail the core of the England rearguard. Capello, teasingly, mentioned that he knows who his goalkeeper will be next summer. The veteran David James misses this match and Robert Green will be between the posts. He could have every opportunity to show off his skills against Holland. England have won only once in the previous 10 encounters with the Dutch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
