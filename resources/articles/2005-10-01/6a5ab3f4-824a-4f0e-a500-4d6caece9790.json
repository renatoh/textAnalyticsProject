Mr Zuma was sacked by President Thabo Mbeki in June after his financial adviser was convicted of corruption, but he remains so popular that his impending court case has split the ANC. The state prosecution has requested more time for its investigation. Mr Zuma is facing two corruption charges, and further counts of fraud and perjury may be added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
