The 25-year-old Escreet tours this week with a superb American band, joining postbop, advanced funk, ingenious composing and an improvisational vocabulary purged of cliche. Bojan Z, now 41, leads one of the best groups of his career, through his discovery of London bass/drums duo Ruth Goller and Seb Rochford, partners in the extreme-funk Acoustic Ladyland quartet. Escreet's group played first, and patiently built a remarkable set from rather dispassionate, rhythmically intricate layerings to exuberant, mutated-bop horn choruses. Ambrose Akinmusire confirmed why he's won trumpet prizes from judges as discriminating as Quincy Jones and Hugh Masekela, delivering an astonishing solo feature early in the show that combined distinctive wide-interval melodies, deceptively casual asides and a pristine tone. Escreet's hard-struck, drum-like chords, bassist Matt Brewer's originality of phrasing, drummer Nasheet Waits's controlled fire and saxophonist David Binney's inexorable yet cumulatively dramatic buildups made the band's music irresistible for its skill, freshness and concentration \u2013 qualities that made its fitful excursions into regular Latin and jazz-swing devices sound startlingly new. Bojan Z's Tetraband, playing music from its new Humus album, was outwardly friendlier in its riffy hooks, but just as sharp at reinventing the familiar. Beginning with spooky noises, loose grooving and Frankenstein stompings, the set became a collective-playing model, though Gianluca Petrella's huge sound and secure pitching often rightly put him in the spotlight. The roaring rock-band exuberance of Greed (In Goods We Trust) showed just how much scalding intensity Seb Rochford can generate with the minimum of effort.
