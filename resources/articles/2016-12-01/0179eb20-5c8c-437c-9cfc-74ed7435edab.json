Jason Greenblatt, who served as Trump\u2019s top adviser on Israel policy during the campaign along with fellow lawyer David Friedman, will take on the role in the president-elect\u2019s administration. Friedman has already been announced as Trump\u2019s controversial pick for ambassador to Israel. Greenblatt, whose expertise is in real estate law, did not have any significant foreign policy experience prior to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. He wrote a Washington Post editorial in July defending Trump from charges of antisemitism. His appointment comes as the Obama administration controversially declined to veto a resolution in the UN security council on Friday that condemned settlement construction by Israel in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. This action met bipartisan condemnation in Congress and Trump pointedly intervened on social media to request that Obama veto the measure. Greenblatt\u2019s appointment is further evidence that Trump\u2019s administration will mark a sharp change in direction in policy toward Israel and the Palestinian territories. \u201cMr Trump does not view the settlements as being an obstacle for peace,\u201d Greenblatt said in a November interview. He added: \u201cThe two sides are going to have to decide how to deal with that region, but it\u2019s certainly not Mr Trump\u2019s view that settlement activity should be condemned and that it\u2019s an obstacle for peace \u2013 because it is not the obstacle for peace.\u201d In a statement released to CNN, Greenblatt said: \u201cMy philosophy, in both business and in life, is that bringing people together and working to unite, rather than to divide, is the strongest path to success. I truly believe that this approach is one that can yield results for the United States in matters all over the world.\u201d Aside from his work for Trump, Greenblatt practiced law at the firm of Fried Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson, and also formed a business called The Credit Workshop in 1992 with his brother, Joseph Greenblatt, who is currently serving up to 18 years in New York prison for fraud. The father of six also runs a parenting blog with his wife, Naomi."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
