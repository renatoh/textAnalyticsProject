Four British heavyweights \u2013 three of them unbeaten, the fourth a former world champion on the comeback trail \u2013 at or near world level mentioned in one paragraph: that is surely a sign that the division here is as strong as it was when Lennox Lewis ruled 12 years ago, probably stronger. Haye had let slip that he and Joshua were scheduled to collide \u201cvery shortly\u201d, which found quick agreement with the latter. \u201cYou heard it here first,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cSome time, down the line, our paths will cross \u2013 whatever it\u2019s for. You\u2019ve got two great athletes.\u201d Since Lewis quit in 2004, the sport\u2019s most-coveted title has had legitimacy through the reign of Wladimir Klitschko and, intermittently, his brother, Vitali \u2013 but not much of excitement. That could be about to change. These guys are The Exciters. If Joshua can beat the undefeated Whyte \u2013 who had him down briefly when they were novice amateurs \u2013 and Haye sees off the challenge of the heavy-handed Mark de Mori in his comeback next month, an intriguing scenario begins to unfold in which the ultimate prize is a challenge for the crown Fury snatched so rudely from Wladimir\u2019s buzzed head in D\u00fcsseldorf two weekends ago. Chapter one will be written at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. Joshua, who has grown in stature since he turned professional two years and 14 fights ago, should have too much speed, power and movement for Whyte. The Brixton fighter is dangerous but produces his knockout blows from such a wide stance he will create gaps of opportunity that Joshua\u2019s straight right hand will surely begin to explore from round one. The job ought to be done by rounds five or six. He then needs to step up \u2013 or, maybe, briefly sideways \u2013 and that is where Dereck Chisora comes in. He is on the undercard, against 16-13 trial-horse Jakov Gospic, and no doubt would be willing to take on Joshua on the undercard of the Carl Frampton-Scott Quigg super-bantamweight unification fight in Manchester on 27 February. To sustain the narrative, Haye has to beat De Mori at the O2 Arena on 16 January, which would position him perfectly to fight Joshua on the undercard of a 4 June open-air extravaganza at Wembley Stadium, if Eddie Hearn can next week persuade Amir Khan to fight Kell Brook two days before Ramadan begins that month. The winner of Haye-Joshua would be a rightful and lucrative contender to fight Fury for whichever, if any, of the world belts he still holds in another football stadium fight towards the end of the summer. Fury, of course, has to beat Klitschko in a rematch and is angling to do so in the UK in April or May. All the while the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, idles across the Atlantic. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, obviously \u2013 but those are the best options on the table. For now, Joshua is concentrating on Whyte, for whom he has little affection, although the animosity seems to be as shallow as it is long-running, generated mainly by the man from Brixton \u2013 understandable, as he stands on the outside looking in. They are fascinating antagonists: similar in their ambitions, yet polar opposites in demeanour. \u201cI just find him funny,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cI don\u2019t like people who talk rubbish, that\u2019s all it is. He\u2019s been doing it for the last 12 weeks \u2026 no, he\u2019s been doing it since 2012 or even 2009. It\u2019s just routine now. It\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with Dillian before; he\u2019s always been quite negative and hyped up.\u201d Whyte, naturally, does not see it like that. He sees a favoured, much richer rival, cosseted by the admiration of Sky Sports and Matchroom, the big hope for the future \u2013 and he is determined to upset all their plans. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shy away from things because soon I will be putting my hands on him and he will be putting his hands on me,\u201d Whyte said this week. \u201cI love what the guy does but it\u2019s not him. He won the Olympics and was in the Great Britain squad for a while. Part of him being in the squad is that they teach you how to behave, how to say things \u2013 and maybe a lot of mind-coaching as well. So that\u2019s what I mean when I call him a robot. They wind him up and tell him what to do and what to say. \u201cI don\u2019t need any of that stuff. Whatever he comes at me with on Saturday night, I am here to win and to knock him out. He\u2019s used to having things go his own way and he\u2019s used to controlling everything. So it doesn\u2019t matter \u2026 he could come with iron in his chin and I will be there in front of him trying to break it.\u201d Joshua resents this view of him as a product. He reckons he has been to as many hard places as the man from Brixton. Joshua, of course, was sentenced to 100 hours of community service in 2011 after marijuana had been found in his car when he was pulled up for speeding in London. He was tagged \u2013 and he learned from his mistakes. He replies: \u201cWhen he says, \u2019Your heart will fail you and I\u2019ve always had it against me,\u2019 I just think \u2019So have I, who hasn\u2019t?\u2019 Who hasn\u2019t had it tough? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make anyone any better than anyone else, you just keep on doing what you\u2019re doing. That was part of my story and I\u2019m here now and that\u2019s all that matters \u2013 I\u2019m still going strong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
