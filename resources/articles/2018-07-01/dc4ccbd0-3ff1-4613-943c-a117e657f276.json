It\u2019s attainable in so many ways. \u201cAnd now it isn\u2019t just attainable for half of the population. The other half can be the Doctor as well. Girls will no longer just think, \u2018Oh, I could be a companion\u2019. Being the first female Doctor and showing children that their heroes in shows don\u2019t always look the same is a huge honour for me.\u201d Whittaker, 36, who previously starred in the ITV drama Broadchurch, will make her debut as the Doctor when the series returns in the autumn. The actor said she had been pleased with the reaction after it was announced she would be replacing Peter Capaldi. She said fans understood that the sci-fi series would inevitably go in a different direction with her in the lead role. \u201cIn a way, though, there is liberation in that new direction: the pressure is less for me because I can only do this my way. All the rules are out the window! That\u2019s what makes it so fun.\u201d Doctor Who, one of the BBC\u2019s flagship shows, is under new management, with Chris Chibnall in charge of ensuring it remains relevant. Last year it was announced that Whittaker would be joined by three others for the next series, including an unexpected role for actor, comedian and gameshow host Bradley Walsh. Details of the show, which is produced in Cardiff under great secrecy, remain scarce. On Sunday a teaser of the new series was trailed during the half-time break of the BBC\u2019s coverage of the World Cup final between Croatia and France. The short clip featured Whittaker alongside her new friends. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never seen Doctor Who, or want to introduce your children or family and friends to it, this series is the perfect point to start,\u201d Chibnall told Radio Times. \u201cIt was really important to me that there\u2019s no barrier to entry. You don\u2019t need to know about anything that\u2019s come before. We\u2019ve got a new Doctor, all-new characters, all-new monsters, all-new stories. It\u2019s going to be exciting, emotional and the most enormous fun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
