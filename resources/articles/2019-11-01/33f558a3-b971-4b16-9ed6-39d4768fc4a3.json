First came Billy Elliot, then Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, and now the RSC gives us a show based on David Walliams\u2019 2008 bestseller, adapted by Mark Ravenhill, with music and lyrics by Robbie Williams, Guy Chambers and Chris Heath. The result is a cheerful, tuneful celebration of the desire to be different that could easily replicate the popularity of its predecessors. Walliams-watchers will hardly need to be reminded of the story. It focuses on the 12-year-old Dennis, who is star striker in the school football team but whose life changes when he covertly buys a copy of Vogue. His purchase is prompted by the cover shot of a woman who reminds him of his mum, who has left home. Dennis\u2019s fascination with fashion starts a friendship with a much-fancied schoolmate, Lisa James, who persuades him to try on an orange sequinned dress she has designed. He looks at himself in the mirror with wonder. He never looks back. This show differs from Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, which is about a teenage drag queen, in two important ways. Dennis has to overcome much more strenuous opposition than Jamie, from his headmaster, his family and his fellow footballers. Where Jamie disports himself at a drag-club, Dennis\u2019s transvestism feels more like a temporary measure. Significantly, Ravenhill omits the scene in the book where Dennis enthusiastically tries on everything in Lisa\u2019s wardrobe from blouses to bangles. This show feels less like a celebration of sexual freedom than an assertion of its hero\u2019s right to independence. Even if the musical relies on our own willing acceptance of Dennis\u2019s decision, it has a buoyant Britpop-style score with nicely varied numbers. The most rousing is Disco Symphony, where the whole ensemble turn into black and silver androgynes. The score also boasts the wistful, in a song about A House Without a Mum; the wishful, in a nostalgic number about a beach holiday; and the quietly wicked, in the headmaster\u2019s I Hate Kids. The lyrics rarely take you by surprise but the tunes have an immediate appeal. Gregory Doran\u2019s swift, sharp production shrewdly offsets Robert Jones\u2019s monochrome designs with brightly colourful costumes and makes extensive use of Aletta Collins\u2019s choreography \u2013 even the two football matches feel like a ballet, with the ball propelled by a rod. (The same kind of rod is used by Ben Thompson to manipulate a farting puppet dog.) But the show rests on the shoulders of its young lead and Toby Mocrei \u2013 one of four child actors playing Dennis \u2013 is astonishing. He sings and dances with total assurance yet captures Dennis\u2019s essential loneliness, which finds temporary relief when he dons a dress. Tabitha Knowles \u2013 one of three Lisas \u2013 radiates a natural gaiety that counterbalances Dennis\u2019s introversion and there is good work from the surrounding adults including Forbes Masson as the deeply suspect headmaster, Rufus Hound as Dennis\u2019s burly dad and Charlotte Wakefield as a French teacher. It\u2019s not a musical that radically advances the form but it\u2019s a warm-hearted show that, in championing self-expression, instantly enlists our sympathy. At Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 8 March"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
