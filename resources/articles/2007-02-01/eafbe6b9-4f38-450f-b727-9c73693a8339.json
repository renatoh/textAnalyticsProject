Indeed, according to Michael Jay, permanent undersecretary of state: \"The main ministerial discussion which takes place on foreign policy issues is in cabinet ... Iraq was on the agenda of each cabinet meeting, or virtually every cabinet meeting, in the nine months, or so, up until the conflict broke out, in April.\" (foreign affairs committee, June 24 2003). So how was it possible that in maybe 30 cabinet meetings, ministers were unable to ask the searching questions which would have exposed Tony Blair's fraudulent case for war? If they did not ask questions, why not? The \"dodgy dossier\", the 45-minute claim and other \"evidence\" were open to examination by ministers, or they should have demanded so. The leader of the opposition also had access to the \"evidence\". They all had a duty to cross-examine Mr Blair with forensic intensity before sending British soldiers to risk death. Millions of the public saw through the lies, but most cabinet ministers were either duped or sat silently, some of them putting continued office above their duty to truth, to our democracy and to humanity. Some perhaps even hoped to replace Tony Blair. After the deaths of more than 100 UK troops and possibly 600,000 Iraqis, have they any credibility left? Either their judgment on Iraq was so poor as to make them unworthy of high office, or even worse, they were silent accomplices to mass murder for the sake of ambition. Trevor Phillips Norwich A growing number of Labour MPs who supported the Iraq war now claim they were \"misled\" by Blair. My own MP, Ashok Kumar, was a committed supporter of the war from when it was first mooted. Yet when I challenged him recently on the disastrous outcome his response was \"I loyally supported my leader\". It is difficult to see how the poisonous effect of the Iraq war on Labour's moral credibility can ever be purged but, to start this process, all those MPs who supported the war must now face up honestly to the consequences of their own actions and answer for them. Dr JJ Birtill Guisborough Geoffrey Wheatcroft is right: Peter Hain is even more dishonoured. Early on in the enterprise, he was challenged by a woman on TV about the weapons of mass destruction. He was most patronising saying, in effect, that he had seen the evidence and she had not. Either he lied or made a terrible error of judgment. Bob Gough Walton-on-Thames, Surrey As the only international child-protection organisation now operating in the south of Iraq, War Child welcomes the findings of the Association of Iraqi Psychologists and the reporting of the profound impact of conflict on the lives of children (Report, February 6) . Increasing violence has precipitated the breakdown of the family unit, denied children access to education, forced millions from their homes and cut off many more from basic food and water supplies. In this humanitarian disaster children are becoming increasingly marginalised, left to fend for themselves and younger siblings or forced on to the streets and turning to crime to survive. Yet funding for humanitarian projects is becoming increasingly scarce and difficult to access. Those funds that are available are being concentrated almost entirely on physical reconstruction, to the detriment of equally important psycho-social projects. This acute funding crisis is forcing out of Iraq the organisations with operational experience that are best placed to deliver the long-term projects required to combat the marginalisation of children. Donor agencies must recognise the importance of children's psycho-social needs as much as their physical environment and change funding policies to help operational organisations address them accordingly. With children making up 50% of Iraq's population, these changes could not be more vital to the future success and security of the country.
