They refused, however, to comment on a Japanese report that the two were planning a joint venture which would be based in Britain. \"We are talking about possible cooperation in mobile phones. The talks are at an early stage and no final decisions have been taken,\" an Ericsson spokesman said yesterday. He declined to comment on how any tie-up between the two might work. There are suggestions that it might concentrate on research and development for a new generation of high-speed mobile phones. A statement from Sony said the two companies were \"considering the possibility of business cooperation in the portable phone field\". Last year Ericsson sold 40m mobile phones, giving it 10% of the world market, behind Nokia and Motorola. Sony has around 1% of the market. The Swedish group said some time ago that it was looking at a number of possibilities as it tried to bring its loss-making mobile handset business back into the black and did not rule out a partnership. Analysts have suggested that the best option would be for the group to sell the business or merge it with that of a strong Asian partner. News of the talks with Sony saw Ericsson shares jump 7% yesterday. Last month Ericsson announced that later this year it would halt production of mobile phones at two British plants, in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, putting a question mark over some 1,200 jobs. Last night, Swedish national radio reported that the company would announce a further 10,000 job cuts - about half of them in Sweden - when it reports first-quarter results today. Just over a month ago the group shocked investors when it said it expected a loss of 4bn-5bn Swedish kronor (\u00a3290m -\u00a3360m). It blamed a slowdown in orders for telecoms equipment and mobile phones. With the market primed for a poor first quarter, attention will focus today on the outlook for the next few months and the company's strategy for dealing with the downturn. Nokia is also expected to report first-quarter results today. The Finnish company's shares put on 2.2% yesterday after days of slight rises. \"Big surprises in Nokia's first-quarter result are unlikely, and if the outlook is good the share will hold its recent gains,\" one Helsinki broker said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
