The total private patient income of UK trusts was \u00a3359m in 2001-2, compared with \u00a3334m the previous year. The increase in income in 2001-2 was nearly eight per cent - double the rise in the previous two years, according to a report published today by analysts Laing and Buission. Economist Philip Blackburn from Laing and Buisson said: \"The figures show that NHS trusts have made more money than ever before from private patients. But it is also fair to say that the growth is a mix of increase in demand from patients as well as an increase in pricing.\" NHS trusts in England accounted for 95% of all private patient work in the UK, while London hospitals treated more private patients than anywhere else, the report revealed. The Royal Marsden Hospital NHS trust was the largest private earner with private patient work accounting for \u00a319.3m - 23% of its total core income from all patient activity. However, the rise in private patient activity is unlikely to grow next year because of government plans to put a ceiling on income levels, the analysts point out in their report, NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts: Financial Information 2003. When the health and social care (community health and standards) bill becomes law next year it will prohibit foundation hospitals from earning a higher proportion of private patient income than in the previous financial year. Mr Blackburn predicted the ceiling on private patient income would only affect those trusts which are still building up their private patient work. \"Those trusts who are just developing private practice and are not full up yet, may find themselves in trouble next year,\" he said. Laing and Buission also reported a 30% increase in the cost of agency staff employed by NHS trusts and primary care trusts. UK trusts spent \u00a31.3bn on agency staff in 2001-2, compared with \u00a3980m the previous year - a 31% rise. The figure reflects a continuing reliance on agency staff in the last three years. Agency workers now account for 4.6% of all staff costs - a 0.6% rise on 2000-1 and double the amount since 1997. English trusts pick up more than 90% of all UK agency staff costs, with London leading the way in agency spending. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS trust spent the most on agency staff, with a bill of \u00a330m in 2001-2, representing 12% of total staff costs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
