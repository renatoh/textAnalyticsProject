The Southampton board meet this week to discuss whether to lodge a complaint which would spark a Premier League inquiry into the events surrounding Hoddle's change of clubs two weeks ago. \"We are seriously looking at making a complaint but I want to discuss it with the board first,\" said the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe. Tottenham's captain Sol Campbell may have played his last game for the club after picking up an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal. The defender, who has long been linked with a summer move away from White Hart Lane, could also miss England's friendly with Mexico on May 25 and the World Cup qualifier in Greece on June 6. Arsenal are to come face-to-face with the referee who sent off Patrick Vieira at Sunderland - in the incident which led to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's controversial tunnel row - in the FA Cup final against Liverpool. Steve Dunn, who dismissed Vieira at the Stadium of Light on the opening day of the season for lashing out an arm at Sunderland's Darren Williams, will take charge of the final on May 12. David Beckham will be left out against Charlton tonight as Manchester United try out alternatives. With the England captain suspended for the next week's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich, Sir Alex Ferguson is keen to try out alternatives, particularly the 20-year-old Luke Chadwick. \"Chadwick hasn't got the experience but he has got the ability,\" said Ferguson. Middlesbrough are expected to complete the signing of the Slovakian striker Szilard Nemeth on a five-year contract in the summer. \"I can reveal that from July 1, I will be a player with Middlesbrough,\" he was quoted as saying. One man was yesterday arrested by police fraud squad officers investigating possible corruption at Chesterfield. Roma's lead at the top of Serie A was reduced to six points yesterday when they lost 3-1 to Fiorentina, with Enrico Chiesa scoring two of Fiorentina's goals - the first a free-kick and the second a volley eight minutes from time. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
