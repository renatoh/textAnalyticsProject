The pair in question are thought to be emblazoned with the image of King Ashurbanipal, ruler of the Neo-Assyrian empire from 668 to 627BC, and available for \u00a35.99 from the British Museum. He was spotted wearing them at the first hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, then again on Monday for a chat with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The socks saw a third outing during the leadership contender\u2019s interview with TalkRadio\u2019s Ross Kempsell on Wednesday. Johnson\u2019s team said he owns \u201cmultiple pairs of similar patterned socks\u201d and wears a clean pair each day. Of course, it is possible that Johnson owns several pairs of the same socks but, after images emerged of his less-than-pristine car interior last week, it is easy to see why commentators suspect he could be recycling the same pair. But is it unhygienic to wear socks more than once without washing them? And how often should the rest of your wardrobe be given a good clean? We asked the cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie for her verdict. Socks \u201cI think it\u2019s OK for kids not to wash their socks between wears, but grown men should \u2013 it\u2019s only polite,\u201d says MacKenzie. The type of work you do or the shoes you wear are irrelevant, she adds. \u201cI think you should change them every day without question.\u201d Bras \u201cI used to copresent a show called Too Posh to Wash, and one woman we interviewed hadn\u2019t washed her bra for about eight years,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cBut I think maybe don\u2019t leave it quite as long as that. Wearing the same bra day in, day out is not going to make you ill \u2026 it\u2019s just the notion of it. It will be crawling with bacteria, that\u2019s for sure, but it\u2019s your own bacteria \u2013 it\u2019s not going to do you any harm. I think washing a bra every couple of days is fine.\u201d Pants \u201cThis one\u2019s a no-brainer! Wash them every day,\u201d says MacKenzie. But what about in an emergency? \u201cIf you know you are going to have to go two days, put a layer of loo paper or something in between, or run a makeup remover wipe along the bottom. Depending on your personal preference, you could just go without. If you have tight-fitting jeans with lots of ridges, it may not be a good idea \u2026 or, actually, that could be quite pleasant.\u201d Jeans \u201cManufacturers say you should more or less never wash their jeans, but I would disagree,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cI like to wash my jeans as soon as they start to feel a bit loose.\u201d Increasingly, we are being encouraged to wash our clothes less frequently in order to lighten the load on the environment, and jeans are one of the best items to wash less often, she says. \u201cAlso children\u2019s clothes \u2013 you don\u2019t need to wash those every day, just given them a quick wipe down with a damp cloth if they have spilled food on them.\u201d Coats \u201cI take coats to the dry cleaners because you will usually upset the structure of a coat if you put it in a washing machine,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cBut don\u2019t go mad and don\u2019t waste your money: just wait until it looks dirty and becomes slightly embarrassing.\u201d Johnson, take note."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
