The committee on standards in public life began taking evidence into MPs' expenses. But first Alastair Campbell popped along to a committee to talk about the role of (his word, not mine) loonies in public life. To be fair, he included himself. The Speaker's conference was discussing MPs who have mental problems. They can be thrown out, whereas those with physical illnesses get to stay. Campbell, who had a breakdown himself many years ago, felt this was wrong. He'd circulated a leaflet showing famous people who had had mental health problems, including Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Florence Nightingale, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Sadly it was another dodgy dossier, since he implied that if none of them had lived and flourished, we would be under Nazi tyranny, America would be a slave state, nobody would know about evolution, every cancer sufferer would die, and hospital patients would be left in disgusting squalor. Actually, that does still happen. But you see my point. Also, the five people listed had breakdowns or depression. Their minds continued to function well. They didn't go round stabbing people with hatpins, or imagining they were Winston Churchill. Except Churchill, who didn't imagine he was Napoleon. On to Sir Christopher Kelly's hearing. It was held in a deconsecrated church, so the witnesses resembled penitents coming to be shriven by the priesthood. By the side, like an altarcloth, was a sign depicting the qualities the committee expects to find in public servants: \"selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership\". Where have these people been living? I think if you asked the average MP to perm any two from the seven, he might manage that. But all of them? Gandhi might have had a problem. Yesterday's main witness was Harriet Harman, the leader of the house. The problem of the second homes allowance was discussed. The committee told her that the public favoured the \"barracks\" solution. This means MPs would have to live in accommodation similar to soldiers', with whips patrolling the corridors at 6.30am and telling them to get up or it would be a day in the glasshouse \u2026 Actually that's the kind of thing whips say anyway, so many MPs would feel right at home. Harman thought that if you stopped people living with their families, that would make political life even more unappealing. Sir Christopher was sceptical about her strict rules for expenses and allowances. \"In public life, simply setting up rules and regulations is not enough.\" Harman disagreed. The system, she said, would be \"underpinned by transparency\". It was a mad New Labour vocabulary moment. Imagine having the builders in. \"We're worried about subsidence.\" \"Nah, you're all right. We'll put some transparency in under there and that'll underpin it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
