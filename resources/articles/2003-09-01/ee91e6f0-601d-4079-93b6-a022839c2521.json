The England paceman is still suffering from the shin splint problem that ruled him out of the final Test against South Africa at The Oval but should return to contention for the final game of the season against Leicestershire. \"Obviously it is a blow to us that he is not in the team, but I think it is a massive one to him too,\" said the Sussex captain Chris Adams. \"James is missing out on what is a magical time for the team. He has had a great season. \"We will go there and take them on and hope the better team comes out on top - because we believe that is us at the moment. \"If we can come out with a solid draw that is probably enough, but it will be dangerous to just be playing for that.\" Sussex need 10 points to claim the first championship title in the club's history and their Pakistani leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed requires a solitary wicket to become the first bowler since 1998 to claim 100 first-class victims in a season. Lancashire, who must win to keep alive their slim hopes of snatching the title, are brimming with confidence after enjoying an innings victory over Warwickshire last time out. \"There's not many occasions when you win after the opposition score 450 but it was great to bat well past Warwickshire and then force the victory,\" said the Lancashire coach Mike Watkinson. The former England paceman Peter Martin, who missed that victory in order to have a deserved rest, is likely to play today but Lancashire will be without the fast bowler James Anderson and all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who have been given time off after their heroics for England at The Oval. \"It's a big game against Sussex,\" added Watkinson. \"The more they continue to win matches the more difficult it is for us to catch them but we just want to play hard and finish as high as we can. \"We're not short on confidence and, looking back, we set up the chance of victory in a lot of games only for the weather to take it away.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
