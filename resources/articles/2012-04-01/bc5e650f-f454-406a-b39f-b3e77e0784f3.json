Liverpool is no stranger to big outdoor spectaculars, having had the giant spider, La Princesse, roaming its streets in 2008. That was a fabulous weekend, and this should be too as a story of love, loss and reunion inspired by the Titanic uses the city streets as a giant stage. The 30ft little girl in the show is the one seen in London with the Sultan's Elephant and she will be joined by her 50ft uncle in a show inspired by a letter to her father, who was a steward on the doomed vessel. Various venues, Fri to 22 Apr Lyn Gardner Top Hat \u2013 The Musical, London It's been actor Tom Chambers' dream to emulate his boyhood hero, Fred Astaire. And it was a homemade tape of an Astaire tap routine from A Damsel In Distress, modernised with drums, that landed him an audition for TV medical drama Holby City, where he played hot doc Sam Strachan. And then there was Strictly, which he won with an Astaire-style routine. Now he really is living the dream and playing the Astaire role in a new stage version of Top Hat, the 1935 RKO movie, opposite Summer Strallen in the Ginger Rogers role. The Irving Berlin score has been added to with Puttin' On The Ritz and Let's Face The Music and Dance. Gorgeous. Aldwych Theatre, WC2, Thu to 26 Jan Mark Cook Beats/Thatcher's Children, Glasgow The Arches Platform 18 Award selects two of Scotland's most exciting young theatre-makers and funds them to create a show that will be seen both in Glasgow and at the Traverse in Edinburgh. This year's recipients are Kieran Hurley, whose brilliant Hitch was a hit a couple of years back, and Gary Gardiner. Both shows have a strong political edge. In Beats, Hurley joins with the Arches' resident DJ Johnny Whoop to create a coming-of-age monologue inspired by the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, which in effect outlawed the raves that had spread across the UK in the previous few years. Meanwhile, Gardiner's Thatcher's Children looks at the legacy of the Iron Lady's 13 years as prime minister. The Arches, Wed to 22 Apr LG Making Noise Quietly, London Robert Holman has never been a particularly fashionable playwright, yet he has always earned respect for his emotionally articulate work, which focuses on the inner lives of ordinary people, and which has influenced younger writers such as David Eldridge and Simon Stephens. His seminal Making Noise Quietly seems an apposite title for his trio of playlets, last seen in the West End in 1999. Now its theme of the devastating effects of war seems even more timely. One play tackles the relationship between a conscientious objector and an artist in the second world war; in another, a bereaved mother recalls an estranged son lost in the Falklands; and, finally, an ageing Holocaust survivor helps a disturbed young boy deep in the Black Forest. Peter Gill, himself adept at gently touching plays, directs. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, Thu to 26 May MC Close The Coalhouse Door, Newcastle upon Tyne Lee Hall's The Pitman Painters may be closing in the West End tonight, but another door opens in Newcastle, where he has written new material for this revival of Alan Plater and Alex Glasgow's musical play which charts the history of the mining industry. A celebration of community life in the north-east, its mining tradition and folk songs, Close The Coalhouse Door was first staged in 1968, long before the decimation of the mining industry. Hall's new song and new ending bring the play up to date in this co-production between Northern Stage and Live Theatre, directed by Samuel West. Northern Stage, to 5 May LG Transform 12, Leeds Spread over two weekends, Transform 12 offers the chance to experience West Yorkshire Playhouse as you never have before. The entire building comes alive with a series of shows, works in progress, discussions, feasts and adventures that will take place in pop-up spaces and its labyrinth of corridors. There are some terrific theatre-makers on hand to make this an experience to remember, including Chris Goode, who has been working with nine local non-performers to create a series of solo performances about their lives, and Look Left Look Right's interactive adventure called You: The Player. Curious Directive are showing new work as well as their hit Edinburgh show, Your Last Breath, and Belarus Free Theatre will perform their festival success, Minsk, 2011. West Yorkshire Playhouse, Thu to 28 Apr LG Royal Ballet Flanders: Artifact, London Artifact was the first work created by William Forsythe when he became director of the Frankfurt Ballet in 1984, setting down a clear marker of his subversive postmodern sensibility. It's set out in the traditional four acts, but it's also packed with extravagant elements. Densely choreographed movement sweeps across the stage, but is invaded by two obstreperous actors ranting through megaphones and other surreal characters. Artifact has been seen only once in the UK and this rare second sighting comes courtesy of Ballet Flanders and their bold, soon-to-be-ousted director Kathryn Bennetts. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Thu to 21 Apr Judith Mackrell Spring Loaded, London This annual season of contemporary dance is stuffed with engaging ambitions. For the opening double bill (Tue) Robert Clark's Badlands offers a dark view of love, while Darren Ellis creates four dance portraits of women of different generations. Later in the season comes Agnes And Walter: A Little Love Story, a mixture of dance, physical theatre and clowning inspired by James Thurber's The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. And one of the true quirks of the season promises to be Fran\u00e7ois Testory, directed by Simon Vincenzi in Empire, a work featuring a live accordionist and songs from Edith Piaf to Iggy Pop.
