Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister described the conversation with Retno Marsudi as \u201cvery candid\u201d and said she was determined to ensure relations were \u201con a strong footing at all times\u201d despite previous tense moments that included Indonesia\u2019s decision to proceed with the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran three months ago. Australia withdrew its ambassador to Jakarta, Paul Grigson, in late April in protest at the \u201ccruel and unnecessary\u201d execution of two reformed members of the so-called \u201cBali Nine\u201d heroin smuggling syndicate. Formal ministerial talks were also suspended but Grigson returned to Jakarta in June. Bishop and Marsudi met on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations event in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, signalling their attempts to restore the relationship to a more normal footing. \u201cWe had a very open and candid discussion about a whole range of issues and as I anticipated the relationship is strong and I believe that we will be able to engage even more deeply across a whole range of matters that are of concern to both Australia and Indonesia,\u201d Bishop told the ABC. \u201cLike any neighbours there will be tense moments, there will be challenges, there will be issues that we have to resolve, but our government is determined to ensure that our relationship with Indonesia is on a strong footing at all times. \u201cForeign minister Marsudi asked if we could have a confidential discussion and she asked if it could just be one-on-one and of course I agreed to that, so our staff and advisers and representatives left the room and we were able to have a long discussion, just the two of us.\u201d Bishop said about 20 Australian government departments and agencies were working with a similar number of Indonesian government departments and agencies on about 60 different areas of common interest. She said the pair had talked about how the governments could engage more closely because it was in the interests of the Australian and Indonesian people \u201cthat we get along together, notwithstanding differences and challenges from time to time\u201d. The plight of Chan and Sukumaran attracted widespread attention in Australia after evidence the men had been rehabilitated after they were arrested in 2005 but the government\u2019s repeated pleas for clemency failed to sway the Indonesian authorities. Relations between the two countries were further strained by allegations Australian authorities paid people smugglers to turn a boat back to Indonesia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
