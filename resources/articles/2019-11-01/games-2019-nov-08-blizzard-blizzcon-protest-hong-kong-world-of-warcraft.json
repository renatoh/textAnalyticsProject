The 26-year-old World of Warcraft (WoW) player from Glendale, California, was at the annual fan event in Anaheim held by Blizzard, the games company behind global hits such as Warcraft, Overwatch and more. Each year, more than 35,000 people pack into the city\u2019s vast convention centre to play games, attend talks and share in their fandom. But at this year\u2019s event, held last weekend, there was a different feel. Instead of WoW cosplay, Eric was sporting a mask as worn by Hong Kong protesters to shield their faces from tear gas and facial recognition. And rather than joining in with the hype during panels about the forthcoming World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion, he was outside the convention centre handing out \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d flyers, adorned with the protestors\u2019 adopted symbol, the Overwatch character Mei. Eric has joined the protest group Gamers for Freedom, which he discovered though YouTube. \u201cI figured, I live out here, and I ought to do something I care about,\u201d he explains. \u201cI care about Blizzard games, but I also know the situation in Hong Kong is dire. I want businesses to listen to us, and know there are consequences when they make decisions.\u201d For the past month, the US game developer Blizzard has been engulfed in a political controversy. In October, after a major tournament for the company\u2019s game Hearthstone, esports champion Ng \u201cblitzchung\u201d Wai Chung, who is from Hong Kong, used a livestreamed interview to state his support for protestors in his country. Blizzard\u2019s punishment for expressing this view on their official channel, which doesn\u2019t allow political messages, was to issue him with a year\u2019s ban and revoke his $10,000 prize winnings. The decision provoked global outrage from fans, US senators and Blizzard\u2019s own employees, with people accusing the American company of favouring Chinese business interests over supporting free speech \u2013 a supposed tenet of its corporate philosophy. Disgruntled staff covered the signs on the company campus that expressed its devotion to creative freedom. Bending to pressure, Blizzard later reinstated Ng Wai Chung\u2019s winnings and reduced the ban \u2013 though he is still suspended for six months. This did little to quell the outrage. While Eric and his group protested outside the fan expo at the weekend, the president of Blizzard Entertainment, J Allen Brack, took to the stage for BlizzCon 2019\u2019s opening ceremony, and prefaced the show\u2019s big new game announcements \u2013 Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV \u2013 with an apology to fans. Addressing how the company had handled the Hong Kong controversy, he said: \u201cWe failed in our purpose. For that, I am sorry, and I accept accountability.\u201d For many fans, the apology felt hollow. Blitzchung is still suspended. So too are the two Taiwanese Hearthstone casters who were hosting the stream. In the days following the event, Blizzard Entertainment provided a new comment to the Guardian on the controversy. \u201cWe understand this is an important issue, and it\u2019s one many community members and employees feel strongly about,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe deeply value personal expression, and support everyone\u2019s rights to make their voices heard peacefully and lawfully.\u201d The first point is correct. But the second seems to be contradicted by the company\u2019s actions. Brack has stated the punishment is \u201cnot about the content of Blitzchung\u2019s message\u201d, but about his breaking the rule that official Blizzard channels will not support any political messages of any kind, regardless of leaning. A message from the official Hearthstone account on Chinese social media site Weibo last month, however, appeared to have taken its own political stance. Following Blitzchung\u2019s ban, it published a post, which, translated to English, supports the tough punishment and spoke about protecting Chinese \u201cnational dignity\u201d. Brack has since confirmed that this statement was not approved by Blizzard in the US, as its Chinese publishing partner, Netease, has sole control of its Weibo accounts (a Chinese partner company is a legal requirement for Blizzard to publish its games in China). But the concern for fans is that American companies like Blizzard are willing to let free speech principles slide when it comes to prioritising big business interests \u2013 and that they can have a convenient scapegoat in the shape of a separate, Chinese publisher. Blizzcon 2019 should have been a huge celebration. After opening the show with the apology, the company revealed its long-awaited sequels Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, showing impressive teaser trailers and early looks at gameplay to halls packed with thrilled fans, while millions more watched online. Later in the event, Hearthstone, the online card game which Blitzchung is a Grandmaster in, revealed new expansion, Descent of Dragons, new 8-player Battlegrounds mode, and set esports history, with Chinese player Li \u201cVKLiooon\u201d Xiaomeng becoming the first female Global Finals champion at the event. But for the people behind the game, seeing their hard work unveiled amid the backdrop of global controversy, lead to a complicated mix of feelings. Hadidjah Chamberlin, who prefers using they/them pronouns, is an effects artist on Hearthstone, having worked on the title for the past four years. \u201cI think the fact that J addressed it during opening ceremony was really important, and I\u2019m really glad he did that, personally,\u201d they told us, following the announcement. \u201cHearthstone has always been \u2026 such a fun, welcoming game and that\u2019s one of the things that I really love about it. There\u2019s not a single person involved in any part of this situation that I would wish this on, no matter where you are in this. I think it sucks to have to be a part of that.\u201d On the expo floor, Blizzard built a fully functioning Hearthstone tavern complete with Blizzcon brews, a Duel-A-Dev table, and live band. Chamberlin feels it was important to celebrate the game, while understanding the controversy around it. \u201cFor me, seeing people acknowledge [the controversy], and know that it\u2019s important, and still be able to be excited about the game, and go dance an Irish jig \u2026 The fact that people have room for both of those, I think just speaks so well of our community.\u201d Weighing up those ideas of fandom and civil responsibility has manifested differently for the demonstrators outside the convention centre, many of whom have cancelled their game subscriptions and deleted their access to Blizzard\u2019s online gaming service, Battle.net \u2013 despite their love for these franchises. Blizzard\u2019s games have a vast audience in China, but this success \u2013 as the NBA has also discovered \u2013 will have far-reaching ramifications for the culture and politics of entertainment going forward. Fans are finding they have to balance that. \u201cI adore the lore,\u201d says Eric. \u201cI\u2019ve been an enormous fan of Blizzard, and WoW specifically, for years. But I also realise that there are people elsewhere in the world who can\u2019t voice their opinions like we can in America. And I\u2019m a gamer who wants Blizzard to be successful. Come on guys! I want you guys to do good!\u201d \u2022 Rebecca April May attended a press trip to Blizzcon, where travel and accommodation expenses were met by Activision Blizzard"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
