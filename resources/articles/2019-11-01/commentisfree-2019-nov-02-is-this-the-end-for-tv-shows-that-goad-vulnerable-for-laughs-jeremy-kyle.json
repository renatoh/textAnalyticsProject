The digital, culture, media and sport committee viewed leaked backstage footage of The Jeremy Kyle Show as part of an inquiry into reality TV, going on to condemn the programme\u2019s \u201cbullying methodology\u201d and \u201ccomplete abdication of the duty of care\u201d. The committee was set up after the death of Steve Dymond (who killed himself after appearing on the Kyle show to take a lie detector test), and the suicides of two Love Island contestants. However, while television networks have long been guilty of putting \u201cgood television\u201d before participant welfare, this is also about us, the viewers, and the wider culture of dehumanisation that made exposing and goading often uneducated, generally skint people feel like acceptable telly. This went far beyond The Jeremy Kyle Show. Over the years, even as the numbers of working-class actors have dwindled for lack of funds and opportunity, there seemed to be little about real working-class culture that couldn\u2019t be plundered for television, with shows such as Benefits Street confirming sneering prejudices. While Kyle\u2019s type of show called those being exploited \u201cguests\u201d, other reality genres started refashioning people as \u201ccast members\u201d. This culture of treating human beings as free or cheap, small-screen livestock hit its nadir with shows such as Love Island (watch them at it!), which was supposed to be fine, because \u2013 yay! \u2013 sunshine and bikinis were involved and contestants made money at the end. Other reality shows have been coarser, verging on pornographic, yet were still clearly considered appropriate to commission, film, broadcast and watch. All of which exposes a fundamental disconnect at the heart of collective morality. On the one hand, the recent use of nude images of US congresswoman Katie Hill to shame her was rightly universally condemned. Yet, in Britain, it\u2019s become routine to film young, working-class people fighting, vomiting and copulating, with debasing footage that could haunt them forever. There\u2019s still no shortage of such shows, particularly when you deep-dive into the satellite television channels. However, things do appear to be changing and for the better. While Love Island used to be a high-profile part of the problem, now it\u2019s evolved into something closer to a solution. Operating under the new guidelines, the most recent series was vastly improved, with a drastic reduction in exploitative sexual content. Elsewhere, while there\u2019s still a cynical fascination with people on benefits (that grisly low-budget addiction to poverty porn that never quite goes away), there at least appear to be genuine attempts to enlighten people, rather than relentlessly pushing the scrounger angle. Moreover, not only was The Jeremy Kyle Show axed after Dymond\u2019s death, ITV made it clear it would not be commissioning similar programmes. Am I imagining it or is the treatment of people, especially working-class people, on television becoming marginally fairer and kinder? It\u2019s just a tragedy that people had to die before we got there. Has it come to this, that women must \u2018disappear\u2019? Sick of your body being objectified \u2013 how about getting rid of it? Apparently, there\u2019s a switch from \u201cbody positivity\u201d (celebrating bodies in all their shapes and sizes) to \u201cbody neutrality\u201d, where you completely ignore your body, render it an intellectual-cum-emotional non-issue, and hope others do too. Recently popularised by everyone from Taylor Swift to Jameela Jamil, body neutrality means that you don\u2019t have to worry about being criticised or sexualised \u2013 you can just be. That sounds emancipating, not least after a week when a Michelin chef in Leeds was criticised for requesting that waiting staff applicants send in photographs with their CVs (was he concerned their faces would shatter the crockery?). However, is there also a sense of feminist endgame to this? A generation of women so traumatised by unwanted attention that they\u2019re actually driven to fantasising about not having bodies \u2013 physical presences \u2013 at all? Could this tie in a little too closely with that size zero nonsense of yesteryear, or even with food disorders where sufferers often say that they want to \u201cdisappear\u201d? In terms of freedom from judgment, body neutrality sounds intriguing, but why should women have to go to the extremes of vanishing their bodies in order to feel free and be taken seriously? Hugh Grant was quite right to snub Sajid Javid Why has Hugh Grant been slated as an elitist when it was Sajid Javid who behaved like one? The chancellor of the exchequer has spoken about how Grant refused to shake his hand at The Irishman film premiere: \u201c[Grant] said, \u2018When you were culture secretary, you didn\u2019t support my friends in [anti-media intrusion campaign] Hacked Off\u2019.\u201d Javid added: \u201c I think that is incredibly rude. I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working-class people no matter what station they reach in life.\u201d Hmm. I\u2019m always up for a bit of class war, I\u2019m also increasingly concerned about the loss of press freedoms, but Javid\u2019s account is disingenuous at leastbest. Grant wasn\u2019t referring to celebrity friends, rather, ordinary people whose personal tragedies were exploited and who\u2019d met Javid, only to be treated in a way that was \u201cborderline contemptuous\u201d. So Grant\u2019s snubbing was inspired by Javid\u2019s prior elitist behaviour. An elitist, furthermore, who went on to fret about \u2013 what exactly? The death of Shamima Begum\u2019s baby in a Syrian refugee camp after Javid, posing as a hard-man home secretary, refused to allow the child to return to receive hospital care in Britain? Or, more recently, as chancellor, his refusal to carry out a thorough assessment of the economic dangers of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, claiming it was \u201cself-evidently in our nation\u2019s economic interest\u201d? No, Javid is peeved that a celebrity refused to shake his hand at a film premiere. Perhaps Javidhe needs to get his priorities straight. Moreover, I cringed at the telling term \u201cstation in life\u201d, implying that, in Javid\u2019s view, it would have been understandable had Grant refused to shake the hand of a dustman. Again, who is the elitist? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
