The move is the latest example of how the White House is seeking to rid the US telecommunications industry of any reliance on China. It comes after the Trump administration banned network manufacturer ZTE from buying US products in 2018 \u2013 a move that was later reversed \u2013 and its placement of severe restrictions on Huawei, which has separately been accused in an indictment of stealing trade secrets. The Department of Justice said that its executive branch recommendation to the Federal Communications Commission \u2013 which authorises US telecommunications licences \u2013 was based on new information about China\u2019s alleged role in \u201cmalicious cyber activity\u201d targeting the US, and fears that China Telecom was vulnerable to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment. The justice department also alleged that China Telecom had made inaccurate statements to the US regarding its cybersecurity practices and the \u201cnature\u201d of its US operations, which the department said was giving Chinese state actors opportunities to engage in malicious cyber-activity enabling economic espionage and the \u201cmisrouting\u201d of US communications. \u201cToday, more than ever, the life of the nation and its people runs on our telecommunications networks,\u201d said John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security. \u201cThe security of our government and professional communications, as well as of our most private data, depends on our use of trusted partners from nations that share our values and our aspirations for humanity.\u201d In a statement, China Telecom denied the allegations. It said: \u201cThe company has always been extremely cooperative and transparent with regulators. In many instances, we have gone beyond what has been requested to demonstrate how our business operates and serves our customers following the highest international standards.\u201d The move by the Trump administration comes months after a bipartisan letter from two senators \u2013 Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York and Republican Tom Cotton of Arkansas \u2013 called on the FCC to rethink previous authorisations to China Telecom, citing the Chinese government\u2019s role in promoting economic espionage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
