Australia\u2019s No 1 player did not allow two rain breaks during play at Hard Rock Stadium distract her and she wrapped up victory with an ace after breaking Kontaveit\u2019s resistance in the second set. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long day,\u201d she said on court afterwards. \u201cYou can\u2019t control the weather. It was an opportunity for me to drink coffee and watch a bit of the golf. I was able to reset and come back out and do what I wanted to do.\u201d Barty trailed 0-2 when play was first halted just six minutes into the centre court match. Upon the resumption, the Queenslander broke Kontaveit\u2019s serve to get back to 2-2 before the players were again forced off the court. Barty handled the prolonged absence much better and, after going ahead 5-3, she broke Kontaveit\u2019s serve to love to claim the opening set, aided by a double fault on set point. Trailing 1-3 in the second set, Barty stuck to her game to win the next five games as Kontaveit\u2019s errors mounted. Barty will enter the top 10 at No 9 when the latest world rankings are announced next week, having enjoyed a impressive run in Florida which has included wins over compatriot Sam Stosur and world No 2, Petra Kvitov\u00e1. It caps a remarkable return after she turned her back on the game to play cricket late in 2014. She returned to tennis three years ago, and now has a chance to claim the biggest singles title of her career to date. \u201cI\u2019m a much more mature person,\u201d she said of her return to tennis. \u201cWhen I came back it was on my terms. I was able to surround myself with good people.\u201d Barty will meet either world No 3 Simona Halep or Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1, who play later in the day, in the final. When asked how she will approach the decider, she said she will just try to enjoy it. \u201cYou have to go out there and embrace it. Play with freedom and play my best tennis. \u201cI played Sim in Sydney earlier this year. She\u2019s finding some of her best tennis again. Both of them have qualities and I\u2019ll certainly have to play my best to beat them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
