Referring to the fatal beating of Mau Mau prisoners, Powell said: \"We cannot say, 'We will have African standards in Africa, Asian standards in Asia and perhaps British standards here at home.' We must be consistent with ourselves everywhere. We cannot, we dare not, in Africa of all places, fall below our own highest standards in the acceptance of responsibility.\" Dr John Doherty Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire \u2022\u2008Why no mention of the Triple fff brewery (Make mine a pint of Gold Rush, G2, 11 April)? With the exception of its beer Alton's Pride, all its other beers are named after rock/pop songs. Apache Rose Peacock (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Bitter End (Placebo), Comfortably Numb (Pink Floyd), Dazed And Confused (Led Zeppelin), Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen), I Can't Remember (Alice In Chains), Little Red Rooster (Rolling Stones), Moondance (Van Morrison), Pressed Rat And Warthog (Cream), Rock Lobster (B-52s), Stairway To Heaven (Led Zeppelin), and Witch's Promise (Jethro Tull).

Peter Melville Guildford, Surrey \u2022\u2008I would argue that the best tear-jerkers are sad, slightly ridiculous and true (Letters, 11 April). One of the first versions of Long Black Limousine is by Dottie West who died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash while rushing to a gig: \"The race on the highway, the curve nobody seen / Now you're riding in that long black limousine.\" Toby Wood Peterborough, Cambridgeshire \u2022\u2008Is it warmer in the Scillies because, like most of us in Britain, they pay their taxes (Report, 11 April)?
