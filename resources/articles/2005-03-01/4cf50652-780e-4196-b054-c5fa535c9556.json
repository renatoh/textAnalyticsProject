But there is no doubt that it is a worthy aim. A report prepared by Tax Justice Network (TJN) suggests that the world's richest people have squirrelled away no less than $11.5 trillion of assets into off-shore tax havens safe from the prying eyes of the tax authorities. It makes the \u00a31bn a year that the chancellor is intending to raise seem like petty cash. Even if the TJN figures - which do not include the tax-avoidance activities of multinational corporations - are only half right they imply a truly huge amount of uncollected tax revenue. Potentially such money could be used to fund hospitals or schools or help finance the problems of developing countries. Globalisation and the digital revolution have made it far easier for footloose funds to cross national borders to safe havens. It is difficult to track such traffic, but not impossible. One problem is that there are no internationally enforceable rules and no supranational body - such as a global version of the Inland Revenue - to tackle offenders. Also, the forces making it easier to move money have not yet triggered an equal and opposite force in the shape of global consumer lobbies equipped to take them on. There is an important principle at stake. Governments should leave people and companies alone as much as possible to carry on the business of wealth creation. But the flip side of such a concordat is that they should pay their fair share of taxes. Most of the money lodged in off-shore accounts is probably legitimate - the result of small countries offering artificially low tax rates just to attract financial flows from rich individuals and companies. But it is against the spirit of the law in the countries where the wealth is generated. At a time when rising demand for public services such as education and health is clashing with the increasing disinclination of citizens to pay more taxes, there is an urgent need to find more sources of revenue. International tax avoidance is the obvious place to start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
