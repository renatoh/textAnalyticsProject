There it was... and it was mine - at least for the weekend. Morse, God rest his soul, did have a red Mark Two of course. Of sorts. The Oxford sleuth's car was an unconvincing maroon with a black vinyl roof that added not one jot of charm. His was the least powerful of the Jags, at 2.4 litres, and it has been reported that the screen car began life as a Daimler V8, the Mark Two's sister car, and was rebadged for the show. My car, LFF 810, is in a different class. It is 38 years old and there is no doubting its pedigree, although Bespokes had tweaked it - power steering, rear seatbelts and a good hi-fi - to make it even more appetising for twenty-first century motoring. But these were minor embellishments. Make no mistake, this car oozes the style of the Sixties, when the Jaguar Mark Two was made. It earned a reputation as a swift, luxurious sporting saloon - winning favour from police forces as the best fast-response squad car, while bank robbers are reputed to have considered little else as their getaway car. As I stepped inside I was greeted by a panorama of gleaming walnut and cocooned in cranberry leather. The switchgear above the four-speed gear lever is reminiscent of a fighter pilot's, and the wooden Moto-lita steering wheel is studded with aluminium. Hooked yet? I was. Outside the red coachwork was not in concours d'elegance condition, but was very, very nice just the same. The chrome sparkled everywhere, from the aggressive wire wheels and bumpers to the rooftop aerial and the jutting headlamps boasted central studs emblazoned with the letter J. As a Jaguar fan I turned down the competing delights of an Aston Martin, Ferrari (much more expensive) or a Porsche. Bespokes' range also includes the more down-to- earth Triumph Stag and the delightful, underrated charm of the Jensen Interceptor (only seven litres to play with there). I had always wanted to try the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Mark Twos, the 3.8. Boys and their toys? Absolutely. I picked the Jag up from Bespokes' Watford HQ, in Hertfordshire, and drove towards London. Traffic literally stopped to let me past - wonderful! Even the latest generation of drivers, who weren't born when these cars ceased to roll off the Coventry production line, were only too happy to stop and watch as I turned off the M1 and headed for central London. Morse, aka actor John Thaw, reportedly turned down the offer of his screen car as a parting gift, complaining it was too slow and 'terrible to drive'. Carlton TV dismissed this but admitted that Thaw, who in real life drives a new Jaguar XK8, was not a great fan. He should have driven mine. Pukka power steering, horsepower to burn and very decent brakes, it was a delight. The gearbox had to be cajoled at times but so what? This is a classic with more than 100,000 miles on the clock, for goodness sake. The six-cylinder XK engine was superb, an orchestra purring away in front of me. Today's cars may be faster, cleaner, more economical and safer... but they are not prettier and are certainly not more enjoyable to drive. It didn't look out of place outside the Savoy (well, what the hell, if I could afford to fuel it for the weekend, I could afford a soft-drink sundowner in the American Bar). Where next? Oxford was tempting, to promenade around the city \u00e0 la Morse or thunder along the A and B roads around Woodstock. Instead I opted for the delights of Kent. First up to Eynsford, near Sevenoaks, with its pretty ford and Highland cattle grazing within a few yards of the Plough pub-restaurant. Then it was time to open up the car a little along Kent's A roads (the best terrain for this thoroughbred) and on to the picturesque Tonbridge area and Hever Castle. My wife doesn't share my passion for such cars. I am an old fart of the highest order in her book, but even she was taken by this transport. Our children, Kit, 10, and Holly, eight, could not make up their minds, but were pleased about the rear belts and intrigued by the plethora of chrome. I should say so. At Hever, LFF 810 stopped the traffic again. Families heading for the castle or maze turned in their tracks to come and take a peek. The mild exertion of the drive had not troubled the old cat one iota. Water temperature dead level; oil pressure rock steady; only the petrol gauge had flickered. The castle guide asked me how old the car was. He did not quite believe it when I told him, but he walked around it at least three times, so as to satisfy himself. The castle, maze and water maze followed before the leather and walnut proved irresistible again. As we left, I was only glad no one had mistaken me for Morse although I could not help wishing he could have tried old LFF himself. I'm sure it would have changed his verdict on a real Jaguar Mark Two.
