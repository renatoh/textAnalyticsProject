The deal, known as the regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP), includes China and Japan and covers almost one-third of the world\u2019s economy. It will open up new opportunities for trade in telecommunications and financial services, the prime minister said, while adjustments to customs procedures and technical standards would make business run more smoothly across the region. But as the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, arrived in China on Tuesday with a delegation of 200 Australian companies, the pact only serves to highlight the government\u2019s increasingly perilous balancing act between its commercial and strategic interests. Birmingham will be hoping to repair some of the damage done to Australia\u2019s relations with China after Canberra\u2019s decision to block the Chinese technology company Huawei and accusations of a cyber-attack on Parliament House. Part of his itinerary includes a huge import fair taking place in Shanghai this week. In pointed remarks clearly aimed at countries like the US and Australia that have excluded Chinese technology companies, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, urged a more open attitude to technology cooperation \u201cso that the source of innovation can fully flow\u201d. \u201cWe should jointly strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights, rather than engage in knowledge blockades, create and even expand the technological divide,\u201d Xi said. Australia and the US have both excluded China\u2019s Huawei from its 5G networks and senior government officials from both countries have accused China of intellectual property theft. Despite the rhetoric, there is concern that the RCEP agreement will tighten China\u2019s hold on the Asia-Pacific economy, especially because India decided to opt out in order to protect local industries from more competition. Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the Fulbright University Vietnam and an expert on the Chinese economy, said Australia should be sceptical of the benefits of the deal, details of which have so far been kept secret. \u201cI would be profoundly sceptical that China wants to loosen any trade barriers, despite what Xi says,\u201d he said. \u201cExports from China to the rest of the world are flat and imports are down 5%. China won\u2019t be reducing trade barriers \u2013 it is slowing trade. It is reducing coal and iron ore imports from Australia, for example, in favour of local industries.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He also questioned whether Australia should be prepared to pay the price of doing more business with Beijing. \u201cWhen countries do a trade deal with the US, they are free to criticise Trump or America\u2019s human rights record. But when you do a deal with China you don\u2019t have that freedom. So it\u2019s fair to say there is a trade-off when we do a trade deal. What will Australia be expected to give? Will it be forced to stay silent on South China Sea matters, or Xinjiang, or Hong Kong?\u201d Then there is the problem of India\u2019s non-involvement in the pact. Another expert said the decision to join the sprawling trade deal, which will not include the US or India, showed a \u201cdisconnect\u201d with Canberra\u2019s strategic goals. India, which is often cited as a ready-made alternative market for Australian goods in the event of Chinese relations going sour, balked at joining because it would expose its peasant dairy farmers to competition from ruthlessly efficient milk producers in Australia and New Zealand. Australia already has a free trade deal with the other RCEP countries, but not with India. Policymakers in Canberra might dream of using closer ties with India and the US to counterbalance the might of China in Asia, but the economic reality is proving more of a diplomatic nightmare. Prof James Laurenceson, the acting director of the Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI) at the University of Technology Sydney, said that the RCEP agreement was \u201cat odds\u201d with strategic movements across the region. \u201cWe\u2019re meant to be engaging more with India and the US but on the economic side, we\u2019ve seen Trump pull out of the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] and now India have refused to sign up for the RCEP. There\u2019s a big disconnect there with what is happening in the strategic area. \u201cWe often see the region as we would wish to see it and not as it actually is. We are supposed to share the same values and are committed to open markets. But, really, India and the US don\u2019t share the same values, as the TPP decision showed.\u201d Melissa Conley Tyler, the director of diplomacy at the Asialink centre at the University of Melbourne, said the RCEP deal would have less effect on Australia than some other countries given existing trade deals. \u201cFor Australia the agreement is symbolically important as a statement promoting global trade at a time of protectionism,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
