The release of the inquiry\u2019s findings on Thursday prompted widespread condemnation in Australia, including from the former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the report, and the former chief of defence and current governor general David Hurley, who described the allegations as \u201cunforgivable atrocities\u201d. Maj Gen Justice Paul Brereton, who led a four-year review of special forces\u2019 conduct in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, found evidence showing that 25 perpetrators had unlawfully killed 39 Afghan civilians, most of whom were detainees, and none of whom died in the heat of the battle. In some cases, there is evidence that the alleged killings took place at the instruction of patrol commanders, who told young soldiers to make their first kill by executing prisoners, a practice known as \u201cblooding\u201d. The alleged victims were not combatants and there was no doubt or confusion about the intent of the special forces soldiers, the report said. Earlier work by the military sociologist Samantha Crompvoets disclosed allegations that two teenage Afghan boys had their throats slit by Special Air Service operators, and canvassed \u201cbody count competitions\u201d and the indiscriminate killing of \u201csquirters\u201d \u2013 villagers who fled from a helicopter\u2019s approach. In Afghanistan the findings prompted shock and outrage as the nation woke late Thursday, Australian time. The Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organisation\u2019s executive director, Hadi Marifat, spoke to Guardian Australia as his staff prepared to inform some of the families of alleged victims about Brereton\u2019s findings. \u201cIt is a lot of questions for us, how to do it, basically,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot further traumatise the victims by giving further details. We would like to be at the same time honest and tell them exactly what happened according to this report.\u201d Marifat, speaking from Kabul, described evidence of the \u201cblooding\u201d of new soldiers as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. The level of violence was nothing new to many Afghans, he said. What was shocking, though, was the report\u2019s finding that there was credible evidence that it was perpetrated by Australian forces, who had the goodwill of many locals. \u201cWhat is actually shocking for us is that we have been expecting better from Australia and Australian armed forces,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me be very frank with you \u2026 when it comes to the overall perceptions of Afghans towards Australia and Australian armed forces, we know they have done a lot of good things in this country. \u201cBut one thing that was really painful for us is how despite this goodwill that was there from the side of the Afghans, we were not expecting at all this from the Australian armed forces. We were not even making a comparison between the Australian forces and the United States special forces and particularly the CIA, when they were involved in the torture and taking the prisoners from here to their black sites.\u201d The chief of the Australian defence force, Angus Campbell, gave a direct apology to victims and their families on Thursday, and said he was exploring setting up a scheme of compensation. Marifat and others are in favour of such a scheme but they say the greatest priority is involving alleged victims in the looming criminal investigation and potential prosecutions. The head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, Shaharzad Akbar, called on Australia to set up an independent body to represent Afghan victims of Australian special forces\u2019 alleged war crimes. Akbar also called on the Afghan government to conduct its own investigations to find witnesses from Afghan forces who might help with prosecutions of Australian soldiers. Speaking from Kabul, Akbar described the report\u2019s findings of credible evidence that Australian soldiers killed Afghan civilians as \u201chorrific abuse\u201d. She said the commission, which had tried to monitor human rights in Uruzgan province during the Australian deployments, had four files on matters likely to relate to the incidents detailed in the investigation report into alleged Australian war crimes. Akbar said it was important that the rights of alleged victims\u2019 families were closely monitored in any investigative or compensation process. \u201cIt is important that the Australian government has a separate entity for the victims to provide outreach for compensation or any redress and of course they should be kept informed of the progress of the investigation. They have every right.\u201d Akbar said the Afghan government needed to keep the pressure on the Australian government to ensure the criminal investigation went ahead. She said it was important that members of Afghan forces who may have been witness to any of these alleged crimes be encouraged to cooperate with Australian authorities. The Australian Afghan Lawyers Association expressed its deep concern about the findings of the report, saying it showed the \u201cdehumanising of the Afghan people\u201d and a \u201ccomplete disregard for Afghan lives\u201d. \u201cWe hope that this leads to justice and accountability for those impacted by these alleged war crimes and that this starts the process of healing for a country that has experienced a long and protracted history of war,\u201d said an association member, Diana Sayed. Speaking to the ABC on Thursday evening, Campbell said cultural and leadership problems, combined with slow deterioration of oversight mechanisms, had created a space for the alleged crimes to have occurred. \u201cAll of a sudden you have a space in which some chose to act unlawfully, perhaps with a belief that they might not be held to account,\u201d he said. He defended redacting the details of one alleged incident, referred to as \u201cpossibly the most disgraceful episode in Australia\u2019s military history\u201d, saying transparency would compromise future criminal proceedings.
