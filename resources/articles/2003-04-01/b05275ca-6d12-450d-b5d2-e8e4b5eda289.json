His Artemis UK Special Situations fund has produced a 37.41 per cent return over the three years since launch in March 2000. That is staggering compared with the 42.2 per cent loss suffered by the average fund in the sector. His strategy sounds ridiculously simple. He looks for bargain stocks that he thinks will rise in price. So far, so much like any other investment manager. But his approach differs in two key respects. First, he looks for gems among the dross of companies that have gone off the rails, perhaps because of mismanagement, a poorly executed strategy or because their business is no longer flavour of the month. And while other fund managers aim to closely track a particular benchmark and are hidebound by rules that prevent them making big bets on stocks or sectors, Stuart is free to invest wherever he likes, regardless of 'correct' weighting in companies or indices. When the trust launched, everyone else was piling in to Vodafone, Baltimore and lastminute.com. Stuart put more than a quarter of the portfolio into housebuilders, the archetypal old economy stock, many of which could then be picked up on multiples of less than five times future earnings - a twentieth of the valuations of some technology stocks. Now that investors prize the predictable earnings to be had from housebuilders and food manufacturers, he is looking at software companies - Codascisys and Xaar are recent purchases. 'You can buy good quality companies on just nine times earnings and at a small premium to their cash balances. I don't know when they will pick up, but they will.' It is no coincidence that the only other trust to have a positive return over three years is also a special situations fund, run by the legendary Anthony Bolton. Everything is doing badly in the current market and the trick is to identify companies that stand the best chance of prospering when the climate improves. But that does not make any special situations fund a sure bet. John Spiers at Best Invest says that the lack of strictures on the managers makes such funds extremely dependent on their skills. If they have a bad patch, or leave, the performance can suffer badly. Investors needs to keep a close eye on both performance and personnel. Neither can they work miracles. Stuart's positive return owes a lot to a stunning first year, when the fund was small and his timing on buying old economy stock was impeccable. Over the past year it lost 17.8 per cent, putting it in tenth place, still comfortably better than the 30.8 per cent average fall suffered by the competition. Over two years it is down 18.6 per cent compared with an average fall of 38 per cent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
