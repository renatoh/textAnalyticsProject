I\u2019m enjoying pristine red admirals on my late-flowering buddleias, the rare and handsome brown hairstreak (the last species to emerge each summer) continues to flourish and there are large whites a-plenty, but we\u2019ve definitely passed peak butterfly. The season is not quite over yet, however. Some exciting migrants, such as clouded yellows and long-tailed blues may continue along the south coast into October. And thanks to the glorious spring and summer, we\u2019re likely to see extra broods of species showing strongly this autumn \u2013 speckled woods, small coppers, wall browns and even white admirals may emerge. Although it is some months before official data can confirm this, it appears to have been an excellent summer for most of our 59 native species. Even those in steep decline, such as the wall brown, have been seen in abundance. But the late broods aren\u2019t all good news: for many species, they are a \u201cdevelopment trap\u201d because the caterpillars produced by these butterflies cannot find suitable food plants or reach the stage they require to survive the winter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
