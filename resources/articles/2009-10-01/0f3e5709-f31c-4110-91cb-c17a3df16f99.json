Donington Park was originally given until the end of September to raise the \u00a380m required to finish the circuit and finance the first race but it has been allowed an extension to complete its financing arrangements. It is understood that a merchant bank is attempting to raise a bond for \u00a3120m from various wealthy investors but Ecclestone warned last month he would take the race back to Silverstone if the funding was not forthcoming. A spokesman for Donington said yesterday they were unable to discuss financial issues and that an announcement would be made in due course. Switching the race back to Silverstone might not be as straightforward as it appears, however. While Silverstone is keen on inking a long-term contract with Ecclestone, it has little interest in signing for a single year in 2010 if the intention behind such an offer is to give Donington Park an extra 12 months to prepare itself for its debut race. The BRDC, which owns Silverstone, believes that would make no commercial sense. \"If the Donington programme comes off, then, fine, the future of the British grand prix is guaranteed for 15 years, at least on paper,\" said Hill, winner of the 1996 world championship driving for Williams. \"But they still have to deliver the race, the circuit and its infrastructure. It's not just a question of raising the money. \"If Donington does not happen, then you have to ask yourself what that says about the decision to look into it in the first place. And in those circumstances it would be nice to think that we could get round a table with FOM [Formula One Management, Ecclestone's company which contracts the various races that make up the world championship] and put to bed once and for all the uncertainty over the future of the British grand prix.\" One of the biggest problems bedevilling grands prix in Europe over recent years has been the difficulty in raising the annual cost of these events which, typically, have a price tag of around $18m (\u00a311.3m), linked to a 10% annual escalator for the duration of the contract. Many new races outside Europe pay Ecclestone's company much more, with the organisers of next month's inaugural grand prix in Abu Dhabi reputedly paying close to $30m for their first event. Hill added: \"I absolutely accept that for new 'fly-away' grands prix outside Europe there should be a premium cost but, by the same token, these new races are tapping into the tradition of long-established races, like the British grand prix, which were in at the very birth of the world championship and have been part of the sport's staple diet ever since.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
