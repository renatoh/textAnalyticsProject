But it was a bittersweet comeback win for the British No10, the daughter of the former French Open champion Christine Truman. Progressing in the competition means she will not have the chance to play in the Wimbledon qualifiers. Reeves became so frustrated about losing to someone outside the top 500 that twice she shouted and gestured angrily at a line judge who had made perfectly correct decisions, offering the crowd the pleasure of being able to jeer her. The American should not have been surprised. Janes is tall and one of the few women for whom serve-and-volley in singles is natural. The day before she had beaten a top-100 American, Ansley Cargill, and on Saturday the world No27 from Spain, Magui Serna, the runner-up here two years ago. That was the best win of Janes career and this is the best run. At 18 she had decided she wasn't going to be good enough, but at 25 she is beginning to change her mind. \"My mum was ecstatic,\" she said, which was a kind way of saying I told you so. But her mother, who was once within a handful of points of winning Wimbledon, had the niceness to enjoy being wrong. \"Amanda had been at Cambridge for four years doing an English degree and I didn't think she should do it [tennis] again,\" she said. \"But when I saw the pleasure she got from trying I changed my mind.\" It is easy to see they rub along well. Amanda is a mirror image of the 1960s heroine in a very literal sense - a left-handed version of the tall fair-haired woman with the decent first serve and the memorably flat forehand, but who was about as likely to roll a backhand as a ha'penny. \"It's an old-fashioned game,\" mother said, though when supplemented by some sturdy volleys it was sufficient for her daughter to scupper three opponents and two rather pressing problems. Amanda has been surviving with only one tennis outfit and a lot of laundering, while the bank has been getting annoyed, she admits, about her use of the credit card. A first-round $4,000 should stop all that, though Janes could conceivably earn more today because she plays Amy Frazier, the world No45 from the United States, who is a practice partner. A downside is that Janes cannot try for Wimbledon because the qualifying event begins today. The winner will play Jennifer Capriati, the third seed, tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
