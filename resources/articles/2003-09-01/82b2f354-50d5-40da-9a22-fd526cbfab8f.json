Ireland will almost certainly need to win their last Group 10 game in Basle on October 11 to have any chance of reaching next summer's European Championship finals in Portugal. And Kerr must seriously consider playing Connolly alongside Robbie Keane, expected to return from injury, after the West Ham striker scored a stunning goal in Tuesday night's 2-2 draw with Turkey at Lansdowne Road. Connolly was winning his 39th cap and claimed his ninth goal in superb fashion after 35 minutes. It was his first strike for Ireland since scoring against Cyprus in a World Cup qualifier almost two years ago. \"Hopefully, my performance will get me into the side for the Switzerland game,\" said Connolly. \"It is a huge game and it is one everyone wants to be involved in.\" Of his 20-yard shot that opened the scoring, the West ham striker said: \"I think I finished it well. I am also pleased to get the man-of-the-match award. There were a lot of good players on the pitch and it is nice to get a personal award, though the result was the most important thing.\" Connolly earned praise from Kerr, who said: \"David has been in good form and scoring goals for his club and he did well, but we know he can do that. He had a very good scoring record when he first came into international football and it is good to see him scoring again.\" Kerr's other main decision to make for the Swiss trip is who will partner Gary Breen in the heart of defence with the captain Kenny Cunningham, absent last night, missing again through suspension. In his place, Andy O'Brien played the first 75 minutes before being replaced by Richard Dunne. The substitute scored Ireland's injury-time equaliser which preserved Kerr's unbeaten record in charge. The goal could have well have been disallowed, as the scorer himself suggested, with Stephen Carr's corner appear ing to be handled by Kevin Kilbane before Dunn struck from close range. \"I don't remember much about it except it rolled down somebody's arm and on to my foot, \" said Dunne. \"I have scored a few goals, but I think in Switzerland we will need to be keeping them out rather than me scoring them. \"I hope to be involved but I have to get into the [Manchester] City team to impress the management and hopefully push for a place.\" There was further misforune for Turkey deeper into injury-time when a linesman incorrectly raised an offside flag to disallow Okan Buruk's header from Okan Yilmaz's cross. Yet Chris Hughton, Ireland's coach, believes the experience against Turkey, the World Cup bronze medallists, will stand the side in good stead for the examination by the Swiss, who severely dented Irish hopes when they won 2-1 on their visit to Dublin last October. \"There were so many positives for us because we put together a side who had not played together on many occasions and they performed heroically,\" said Hughton. \"What you saw is us going into a massive game next month and everybody wanting to stake a claim to play in it. \"We have got used to our players being such a spirited bunch that perhaps for us it was no surprise the way we battled until the end. We were at home and we don't like to give up too easily and even in the last minute it was about getting the result we felt we deserved. \"This game was invaluable for players like Mark Kinsella and Ian Harte. They might not be playing first-team football for Aston Villa and Leeds in the next month - although I'd like to think that won't be the case - yet we might need them to do a job for us. \"We always knew we would need to go to Switzerland and get a result, and the belief has always been there.\" Finally, Hughton warned and at the same time encouraged England before their critical qualifier in Istanbul on October 11, saying of Turkey: \"There is so much passing ability and movement, and a massive asset is their work rate.\" But he added: \"There is a weakness at the back. They are a bit vulnerable and at times leave holes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
