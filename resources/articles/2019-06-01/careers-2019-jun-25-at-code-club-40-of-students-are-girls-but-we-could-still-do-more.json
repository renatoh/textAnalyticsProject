With that in mind, it makes sense for humans to focus on work that can only be done by us, requiring emotions and skills not replicable by machines, such as kindness, empathy and creativity. Despite this, our current education system focuses heavily on reading, writing and maths. They are certainly important, but focusing only on these is to the detriment of building rounded people. In my opinion, so-called \u201csoft skills\u201d are, in fact, essential skills for the future world of work. We need to prepare our future generations for working closely with machines by building their confidence in working with them and their agency over them. To do this, children need exposure to opportunities to experiment with computers and encouragement to build their ideas with code. When I co-founded Code Club in 2012, which provides opportunities for children to develop coding skills through free after-school clubs, the aim wasn\u2019t to turn every child into a programmer. It was to give them the confidence and the skills to work with technology. It shows children what they can do, and inspires them to build ideas and be creative, giving them skills to help in their attitude and agency over technology. Teams of people building products and services with technology should be representative of their users. Therefore, we should be making the opportunity to attend programmes such as Code Club available to everyone, regardless of gender, ethnicity and background. This was really important to me when setting up Code Club, so every effort was made to make it gender-neutral. Now, 40% of Code Clubbers are girls, which is a step in the right direction \u2013 but we can still do more. Changing the way we see education is complex and cannot be laid at any one door. It\u2019s like turning an oil tanker around \u2013 it takes a very long time and a lot of conscious effort. Teachers have a hard job as it is, caused in part by the government, whose focus on SATs and academic assessment means creative subjects are often left to \u201cfill the gaps\u201d, while a lack of funding forces cuts to creative subjects such as art and music. However, if we fail to make changes now, we will face significant problems in finding employment for large groups of people in the future. The good news is that industry and the non-profit sector are working extremely hard to engage young people in what we call digital making. The Raspberry Pi Foundation, for example, recently brought together a consortium of partners to create the National Centre for Computing Education, funded by the Department for Education, to invest in the provision of computing education in England through courses, bursaries for teachers, regional support networks and free resources. They are also working with the National Citizen Service to build a digital programme, helping young people design solutions to social problems. The key to preparing young people to become functioning members of society is to construct an education system that creates well-rounded, emotionally mature people who use creativity, intelligence and empathy to look after others. They are the ones who will build machines to do our dirty work, as they should, leaving us to the do the work only humans can do: care and create.
