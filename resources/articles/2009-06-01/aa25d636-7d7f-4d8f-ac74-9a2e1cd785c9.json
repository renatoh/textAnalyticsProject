He was out twice for one in a game at Headingley between Yorkshire and Glamorgan in 1999, but I'd watched him in the nets and I made damn sure I got him on to the tour to South Africa that winter \u2013 my first as England coach. It was the start of one of my most satisfying working relationships: Vaughan was a classy batsman, but he became a marvellous captain and a good friend. English cricket can be very proud of him. The public saw one side only: a batsman who could cover-drive and pull like a dream, and a tactically astute leader who brought the best out of his players. What they didn't see was the gutsy fighter who could score 177 with a busted knee, as he did in Adelaide in 2002-03, or the burning desire which once made him furious with me when I told him he couldn't play in a one-dayer at Bristol against the Aussies because of a serious finger injury. The truth was Vaughan radiated calm. It was one of his greatest strengths. But beneath that veneer \u2013 one I believe is crucial for any international cricket captain \u2013 was a toughness that few of his team-mates could match. I remember early in his career in Sri Lanka, we had a practice session an hour down the coast from Galle and there was a ridge in the middle of the net. Some of the senior guys were happy to call off the practice there and then, but Vaughan insisted he wanted to bat, and proceeded to play beautifully with the ball whizzing around his ears. I knew then he was the kind of guy I'd go to war with. It was on that tour that I saw another side to him. For all the quiet determination, there was also a mischievous side to Vaughan. Our physio, Dean Conway, started a group called the Who Let The Dogs Out club, and Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick bought into it completely with some of the other younger players. When one of you wanted to get into the room of another club member, the guys already in the room would sing the first line of the song, and the bloke outside would have to respond by barking. We'd then have a few glasses of wine and chat about cricket. Some of the older guys on that tour couldn't be bothered to join in, but Vaughany loved it and we bonded over the chardonnay. He had this presence about him that was obvious even before he made 33 in very tricky circumstances on his Test debut after England had been two for four in Johannesburg. So when Nasser Hussain stepped down as captain in 2003, I knew \u2013 despite press speculation that we should have gone with Trescothick \u2013 that Vaughan was the man to replace him. He took over in very difficult circumstances and South Africa thrashed us in his first Test as skipper at Lord's. All hell had broken loose and I felt sorry for him, but Vaughan responded with typical level-headedness. We sat down and chatted about how to go about the job. It became clear very quickly that he didn't get flustered under pressure. Everyone gets nervous playing sport at the highest level, but some hide it better than others. Vaughan was a past-master, and he was never the type to rant and rave in the dressing room. He could be firm in one-to-ones, but shows of anger in front of the whole team were rare. As a batsman, he was out of the top drawer. I fast-tracked him into the Test side on that first tour to South Africa after seeing him bat in the nets at Pretoria, and he played superbly during that stint in 2002-03 when he was scoring hundreds against India and Australia almost for fun. But one of his finest innings came later on in Sri Lanka, when he batted all day against Muttiah Muralitharan to save a Test at Kandy. People speak about English cricket heroes, but not all of them have had the guts to fight out draws like that. And not many could both win matches, as he could, and save them. It was a rare combination. In the end, I think the captaincy got to him a bit and his knee trouble must have affected the way he played. But it was typical of him that he wanted one last go at the Aussies with a dodgy leg. My relationship with Vaughan was a pleasure. We might have had the odd disagreement about tactics, but no serious fallout sticks in the mind. That's not me being selective with my memory: it's just that we really did get on so well, and he's still a very good friend. It's sad that he's going to announce his retirement, but reluctantly I have to say he's made the right decision. Cricket, and not just English cricket, will miss him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
