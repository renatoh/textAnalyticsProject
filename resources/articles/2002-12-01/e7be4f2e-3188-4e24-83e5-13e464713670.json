It may not be in the same league as Equitable Life, the stricken pensions group that has ruined the retirement plans of thousands of investors, but it is not far off. Abbey has behaved in an irresponsible and cavalier fashion, lending money by the bucketload to companies that have either gone bust, or look as if they might. Financial controls and risk management appear to have gone out of the window. Last week, new chief executive Luqman Arnold confirmed everyone's worse fears when he revealed that Abbey is sinking under a mountain of bad corporate debt, and will post its first loss since it floated in 1989. Small shareholders who have held the stock since demutualisation should be complaining from the rooftops. Under former chief executive Ian Harley, Abbey decided to play roulette with their money by bumping up the size of its treasury operation, which offered loans to flaky businesses such as Enron. If Abbey's treasury managers had been good at their job, no one would have complained, but they were not. And that raises the question of what on earth Abbey was doing straying so far from its area of expertise - providing mortgages to homebuyers. The answer is that Abbey was not satisfied being a humble mortgage lender and aspired to higher things. That meant lending recklessly to all and sundry. To say that the directors took their eye off the ball is an understatement. Let's hope Arnold can salvage something from the mess. He certainly should: Abbey has 15 million customers and is one of the biggest names on the high street. There is a decent business here - but one that has been mismanaged for too long. Ritblat clings on The farce continues at British Land with still no indication when chairman and chief executive John Ritblat will hang up his boots. Last year, there were mutterings from his aides that he would leave soon - possibly in 2003. Now we are told there is no firm leaving date, although presumably Ritblat, aged 66, sticks by his commitment to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. Currently, he holds both positions, which has upset shareholders who point out - quite rightly - that too much power is concentrated in the hands of one man. When that man is Ritblat, there is cause for concern because he is not someone who is renowned for delegating power, nor does he always relish the opinions of others. Accepted, Ritblat's boundless energy and entrepreneurial skills have helped to build the company into what it is today; its prize assets include the Broadgate office development in the City of London and the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. But last week's disclosure that the company is appointing two additional independent non-executives will only marginally ease worries about poor corporate gov ernance. British Land's shares are languishing, and one cannot help thinking that the stock price would get a much needed boost if the succession issue was sorted. Ritblat must state unequivocally when he intends to leave. Continued uncertainty is damaging the company, unsettling both investors and employees. Chow makes a mess The Anglo-Australian industrial services company Brambles has earned the name Shambles after a profits warning wiped a third off the share price and the directors left looking wrongfooted. That is a pity because chief executive Sir CK Chow, the jocular Hong Kong-born businessman, is a likeable individual, although that is no excuse for what appears to be a cock-up that will cost the company millions. I accept that industrial pallets, or containers used by businesses to transport goods from one place to another, are not the sexiest of subjects, but pallets are the life blood of Brambles, which was demerged from engineering group GKN two years ago. The Brambles business works like this: pallets are rented to a company and, when it is finished with them, they are transferred to another customer. Sounds easy, but clearly not for Chow and his fellow directors. Brambles was so obsessed with seeking out new business that it ignored the fact that 14m of its pallets had gone missing, and that managers preferred to waste money buying new containers, rather than finding and securing the old ones. Shareholders are calling for Chow's head to be delivered on a pallet, but the situation is not beyond repair. As a gesture, however, Chow and his top managers should agree to hand back their bonuses or forego future rewards in recognition of their mistakes. Knight blindness What is surprising about Cable &amp; Wireless is not that investors are forcing wholesale management change at the company, but that it has taken so long. The main reason for the delay is obvious: C&amp;W was almost unique among telecommunications groups in entering the slowdown with billions of pounds of cash on its balance sheet. That gave C&amp;W time to prove its new strategy would work. And for years, investors remained supportive of chief executive Graham Wallace's idea of building a business that provides internet services to corporate customers. In short, C&amp;W could afford to get it wrong, as long as it got it right in the end. But eventually it became clear that Wallace's project would never work. Last week's resignation of chairman-elect Graham Nash is highly symbolic. Nash has been a non-executive for years, and has backed Wallace from the beginning. So have most of the other non-execs, such as Raymond Seitz, the former US ambassador to London, and Sir Winfried Bischoff, ex-boss of merchant bank Schroders, not to mention the outgoing chairman, Sir Ralph Robbins - until recently head of Rolls-Royce. You can bet that none of them will be there a year from now, and that Wallace could be gone as early as January. There are many lessons to be learnt from the C&amp;W story. One, surely, is that things can still go pear-shaped, no matter how many City blue bloods and knights of the realm you have sitting in the boardroom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
