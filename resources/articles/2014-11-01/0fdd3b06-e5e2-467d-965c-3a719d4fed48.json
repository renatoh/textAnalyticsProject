The PUP leader released a statement on Thursday saying Rob Messenger, chief of staff to senator Lambie, was being kicked out of the party and labelling him a \u201cdisruptive influence\u201d. But Messenger, a former Queensland Nationals MP, said he had no intention of leaving his role working for Lambie. \u201cI do intend to stay on. Jacqui has invited me to stay on, and quite frankly it\u2019s one of the best jobs I\u2019ve ever had, the most satisfying in politics. We\u2019re doing a lot of good for Tasmania, diggers and war veterans,\u201d Messenger said. Speculation is mounting that Lambie will quit the party and operate as an independent, forming a voting bloc with other crossbenchers, including Liberal Democratic party senator David Leyonhjelm and Family First senator Bob Day. Messenger would not be drawn on whether Lambie would stay in the PUP, but admitted she was having discussions and \u201clooking for support\u201d from other senators. She has it, in principle, from at least two fellow crossbenchers. \u201cBob and I both have quite a cordial relationship with Jacqui on a personal level, so if she\u2019s looking for a friend, Bob and I are here to help her,\u201d Leyonhjelm said on Thursday. Day said he would be happy to negotiate on a topic-by-topic basis with Lambie, but stopped short of agreeing to form a voting bloc with her. The public spat between Palmer and Lambie escalated on Thursday, with Palmer calling his fellow party member a \u201cdrama queen\u201d who was focused on \u201cher own power\u201d. Lambie has refused to be bound by Palmer\u2019s deals on legislation and has threatened to vote against all government bills in protest at the 1.5% pay rise offered to defence personnel. She plans to introduce a private member\u2019s bill linking defence pay increases with politicians\u2019 salaries. \u201cSome of the basic figures we\u2019ve come out with from the parliamentary library show that defence has only received an average yearly increase of 3%, while politicians have received an average yearly pay rise of 7%. That includes in 2012 a pay rise of 33% which is almost $50,000 for politicians,\u201d Messenger said. Lambie planned to post the bill on her website on Friday to start a public lobbying campaign to get the bill through parliament. Day said he respected her dedication to increasing defence pay. \u201cOne can understand why she\u2019s digging in on this, and good on her,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
