The US are No1 in the Fifa rankings, defending World Cup champions, and boast some of the best players on the planet, with Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath spearheading their attack. But the Americans look at it differently. After all, a lot has happened in the four years since the Americans lifted the trophy in Canada. In 2016, they suffered their earliest exit in a major tournament ever, losing to Sweden in the quarter-finals of the Rio Olympics. They have been conceding goals at a worrying clip against top-10 teams, and in the run-up to the World Cup they have failed to beat fellow contenders France, England and Japan. But maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Germany are the only team to have retained the Women\u2019s World Cup, and one reason other teams \u2013 including the US \u2013 have failed may be the complacency that comes with sitting at the top. The US don\u2019t have to worry about that. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a difficult cycle,\u201d Megan Rapinoe admitted shortly after the Americans arrived in France this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been up and down with performances and sometimes the results, not doing well coming off the 2016 Olympics. So, this group feels that motivation and desire to go and win it.\u201d That Olympics loss has also encouraged the team\u2019s coach, Jill Ellis, to squeeze out veterans in search of youngsters who can bring more dynamism and unpredictability. However, when push came to shove, and Ellis named her final roster for the tournament, she went with experience, giving surprise roster spots to veterans such as Ali Kreiger and Morgan Brian, who had been on the fringes of the squad. Now, just as in in 2015, the US will have the oldest roster at the World Cup. Yet Ellis has tried to evolve the USA\u2019s game. The players are expected to push forward from all over the field, rotate and interchange, and use counter-pressing to win possession. It\u2019s a high risk, high reward style that may leave the Americans vulnerable to counterattacks \u2013 and indeed the US conceded 10 goals in five games against top 10 teams this year. On the other hand, the Americans trust their ability to outscore anyone. Full-backs, including likely starters Crystal Dunn and Kelley O\u2019Hara, will bomb forward and provide attacking outlets. Julie Ertz, the defensive midfielder, will join them. The Americans will resemble a battering ram, wearing opponents down. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk that, \u2018Oh, the back line is letting in a lot of goals\u2019 but people seem to forget that the way our team plays, we commit a lot of numbers forward,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cWe really do push numbers high \u2013 not to say we can\u2019t recover, but there are risks that are taken with the way we play. We\u2019re a transition-based team and we love to go forward, especially myself.\u201d For years, fans and pundits have wondered whether the rest of the world had finally surpassed the US, a team that has always possessed superior grit and athleticism but not always the same technical finesse. The USA\u2019s up-and-down form, including a 3-1 loss to France to open 2019, has only increased that discussion. The Americans have never failed to make the semi-finals of a World Cup, and making it that far would be a reasonable follow-up for the reigning champions. But a quarter-final exit would be a disaster. Unfortunately for the US, that is a realistic scenario, especially as the draw puts them on track to face powerhouses France or Germany in the quarter-final. Even if group-stage results shake up the bracket, it will be tough either way. That\u2019s because no longer are the title contenders just the US and a couple of other teams. Several nations can win this World Cup, including some teams that play a more skillful, purposeful style than the Americans. England and the Netherlands, two teams who have never been considered contenders in World Cups past, are among that group. But the Americans are confident their own approach, which is just as much about a relentless mentality than any of Ellis\u2019 tactics. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about winning,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cLooking back on a game, no one\u2019s going to care about, did we connect all of our passes or did we outplay them? It\u2019s about, did we win the game? I think the team that keeps that closest to their hearts is going to lift the trophy.\u201d If this World Cup is decided by who wants it the most, the Americans are surely contenders. It\u2019s not just the stinging loss in the 2016 Olympics that has added a push, but the gender equality lawsuit the players filed against the US Soccer Federation, which would make another rousing success on the biggest stage all the more useful. The players insist the lawsuit isn\u2019t on their minds but it clearly looms in the background \u2013 Rapinoe says the players get \u201cincremental updates\u201d about the legal proceedings but \u201cafter the World Cup our attention can go back to that\u201d. The Americans, of course, aren\u2019t the only ones playing for loftier goals. Jamaica, for instance, has been severely underfunded by their federation and are keen to prove in their World Cup debut they are worth more investment. Players from Australia used the eve of the World Cup to call out Fifa on equal pay. Even France are playing to make more in-roads in a country that locals say has always cared more about the men\u2019s team. In that sense, this World Cup feels more competitive and more pivotal than past editions. Not just because so many other teams have the talent to test the top-ranked Americans, but because more than ever, this tournament offers a chance to push its participants to a higher plateau of relevance. The stakes feel higher across the board, even as the Americans insist the pressure isn\u2019t on them. \u201cI consider France the favorites and I feel like all the pressure is on them,\u201d Rapinoe says. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to play and enjoy ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
