Harris \u2013 Biden\u2019s one-time presidential rival and a barrier-breaking former prosecutor \u2013 is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India and is the first Black woman and the first Asian American to be nominated for a major party\u2019s presidential ticket. \u201cI have the great honor to announce that I\u2019ve picked Kamala Harris \u2013 a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants \u2013 as my running mate,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter. In a tweet, Harris said she was \u201chonored\u201d to join Biden on the Democratic ticket and pledged to \u201cdo what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief\u201d. Biden announced his selection in a text and email message to supporters. His campaign said the two would hold their first event together on Wednesday, in Biden\u2019s home town of Wilmington, Delaware. Though Harris clashed with Biden during the Democratic debates before she dropped out of the race last year, she has become a strong supporter and a voice of authority on issues of racial justice in an election year convulsed by nationwide protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. The decision is of great consequence, not only for Democrats\u2019 immediate political prospects but for the future of the party. Biden, who at 77 would be the oldest person ever elected, has pitched himself as a \u201ctransitional candidate\u201d and a \u201cbridge\u201d to a new generation of leaders, fueling speculation that should he be elected, he would be a one-term-president. In selecting Harris, a 55-year-old Democratic star, he may not only be naming a partner but a potential successor who could become the nation\u2019s first female president. Harris is among the most prominent Black women in American politics, with appeal across the party\u2019s ideological spectrum. She served six years as the attorney general of California before arriving in the Senate in 2016. During the primary, Harris struggled to reconcile her prosecutorial record with her support for criminal justice reform, facing criticism from progressives who doubted her evolution on the issue. But on Tuesday, the announcement was celebrated by Democrats from diverse political backgrounds. \u201cJoe Biden nailed this decision,\u201d said Barack Obama, who went through a similar process in 2008 when he selected Biden as his running mate, in a statement. \u201cBy choosing Kamala Harris as America\u2019s next vice president, he\u2019s underscored his own judgment and character. Reality shows us that these attributes are not optional in a president. They\u2019re requirements of the job.\u201d \u201cShe understands what it takes to stand up for working people, fight for health care for all, and take down the most corrupt administration in history,\u201d Bernie Sanders tweeted. Black women were critical to Biden\u2019s success in the Democratic primary, lifting him to victory in South Carolina after series of stinging losses. But the political landscape changed after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in May, touching off months of mass anti-racism protests that intensified pressure on Biden to to select a Black running mate. \u201cFor a little girl who grew up poor, Black and female in the South to be considered during this process has been an incredible honor,\u201d said the Florida congresswoman Val Demings, who was one of six Black women considered for the role. \u201cI feel so blessed. To see a Black woman nominated for the first time reaffirms my faith that in America, there is a place for every person to succeed no matter who they are or where they come from.\u201d Harris\u2019 own presidential campaign began on a high note in January 2019, as she announced her candidacy on Martin Luther King Day and paid tribute to Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to seek the nomination of a major party. She officially kicked off her campaign with an Oakland rally attended by more than 20,000 people. The one-term senator was considered an early frontrunner for the nomination, and her polling numbers surged after a contentious exchange with Biden at the first Democratic debate. Harris pushed Biden on his past opposition to mandated busing to racially integrate schools. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day. That little girl was me,\u201d Harris told Biden. Biden appeared taken aback by the confrontation, but the two Democrats indicated they had made amends after Harris suspended her campaign in December. Harris endorsed Biden\u2019s presidential bid in March. The Trump campaign immediately seized on their debate exchange to cast Harris as hypocrite, while assailing her \u2013 in the same sentence \u2013 as both a tough-on-crime prosecutor and a far-left radical. \u201cNot long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received,\u201d said Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign and one of his most high-profile Black surrogates. \u201cClearly, Phony Kamala will abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat party.\u201d Though Harris has long been viewed as a likely contender for the nomination, some advisers and allies of Biden harbored reservations. In the weeks before she was selected, reports surfaced that the former senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, part of Biden\u2019s vice-presidential vetting panel, had told donors she demonstrated \u201cno remorse\u201d for her attacks on Biden while on a debate stage. Others anonymously accused her of having too much \u201cambition\u201d and a personality that can \u201crub people the wrong way\u201d. For many Democratic women, the backlash was further evidence of the importance of selecting a candidate who demonstrated the vital role of Black women within the party. \u201cSenator Harris is a fearless champion for justice,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPac. \u201cShe understands the urgency of the moment and will work to restore competent, moral leadership to Washington.\u201d Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016, becoming only the second black woman ever to serve in the chamber. A fierce critic of the president, Harris drew national attention for her prosecutorial-style inquisitions during Senate committee hearings with Trump administration officials. In one memorable exchange, a flustered Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, told her: \u201cI\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast \u2013 it makes me nervous.\u201d Biden was unusually candid about the selection process, an affair traditionally shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. Having spent eight years serving as vice-president to the nation\u2019s first Black president, Biden recalled the experience fondly and presented their working relationship as a model for what he was looking for in a running mate. During Zoom meetings with donors and supporters, he would often expand on his search, emphasizing that he wanted someone \u201csimpatico\u201d with his personality and his world view as well as someone who was ready to govern on day one. Only two women have previously been nominated for the vice presidency of a major political party and neither was successful: Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, in 2008, and the congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. Angela Davis, the philosopher and activist who became a prominent figure in the Black Power movement, was twice nominated as the vice-presidential candidate of the Communist party in the 1980s. \u201cToday is a spark of hope and a watershed moment for Black women and women of color,\u201d said Aimee Allison, Founder of She the People, an organization dedicated to mobilizing women of color. \u201cThis is one step in a much larger fight for representation towards the multi-racial Democracy women of color have dreamed of, fought for and bled for, for generations. We need Black, Latina, Indigenous, and Asian American women leading at every level of American politics.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
