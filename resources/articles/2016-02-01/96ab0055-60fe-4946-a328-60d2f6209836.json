With the game goalless, only 11 minutes remaining and Leicester running out of ideas as to how to break down a resilient and disciplined Norwich, Ranieri took the view it was time to twist not stick and replaced Daniel Amartey, a right-back, with Leonardo Ulloa, a centre-forward. Marc Albrighton, whose crossing had been so disappointing in the previous 89 minutes, finally delivered the low, inviting centre Ranieri had been demanding. \u201cWhen he received the ball I was saying: \u2018Cross on the floor, cross on the floor,\u2019 because they are very good in the air\u201d and Ulloa, following the faintest of touches from Jamie Vardy, was in the right place at the right time to convert. For Ranieri, who had already introduced Jeffrey Schlupp wide on the left for his first appearance in three months, switched Albrighton to the right and moved Riyad Mahrez in behind Vardy to try to give Leicester some more attacking thrust, it was a case of fortune favours the brave and provided an insight into the manager\u2019s mindset with 11 games remaining. \u201cI took a lot of risks,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: \u2018In or out \u2013 it\u2019s not important now. One point is nothing \u2013 we have to win today.\u2019 You can lose but it\u2019s only one point less than a draw. We took the risk but the manager is hired for this reason. I enjoy when there is something to do from my side of things. Saturday was good because when you make a change and the change turns out to find the solution, it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Norwich deserved at least a point from a game in which Leicester struggled to cope with opponents who employed a three-man central defence and sat deep. Ranieri\u2019s side found themselves in the unusual position of having plenty of the ball \u2013 this was only the third occasion this season when they have had the most possession in a game \u2013 and looked confused what to do with it at times; there were 58 minutes on the clock when Vardy had their first shot on target. It is a situation Leicester may have to get used to over the remainder of the season, starting with West Brom\u2019s visit on Tuesday. \u201cI expect more games like this, teams coming here with five defenders,\u201d said Ranieri, who is likely to be without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 after the midfielder picked up a slight hamstring injury. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any easy matches. Every match is a battle but I rate this kind of performance because Norwich are fighting to avoid relegation and if you score at the end of the match it proves the fitness and the stamina is OK. Also the concentration and also the belief was there.\u201d Norwich have taken only one point from a possible 21 and the visit of an in-form Chelsea side on Tuesday will not exactly fill their supporters with optimism. Yet this was a decent performance that could have yielded so much more if Cameron Jerome had not wasted a golden headed opportunity in the first half.\u201cI think if we\u2019d have come in at 0-0 we\u2019d have been fairly satisfied, probably a bit disappointed not to score a goal, but after that sucker-punch we come in feeling even worse,\u201d said Russell Martin. \u201cIt is what it is. We have to take the positives, it\u2019s as simple as that. We still believe we\u2019re a good enough side to be in this league next season and we\u2019re still out of the bottom three.\u201d Man of the match Jonny Howson (Norwich City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
