Jorja Smith beguiled the audience at West Holts stage with her blend of neo-soul and UK garage. \u201cAs the sun sets,\u201d wrote Guardian critic Michael Cragg, \u201cyou can\u2019t deny her this early career-defining moment.\u201d Jorja Smith on West Holts Guardian photographer David Levene captures Jorja Smith as she steps up to a \u2018career-defining\u2019 performance Over on the Park stage, Idles detoxified masculinity with punk that was both snotty and sensitive \u2013 nurses and the crowd\u2019s mums were among those venerated by frontman Joe Talbot. The Vaccines meanwhile opened up the Other Stage, and it was all too much for one Glastonbury-goer. IICON is a brand new Glastonbury stage for 2019 \u2013 set in the east side of the site, but seemingly designed to send people west. Playing from its disembodied head was a dizzying barrage of techno, bass and electronic noise from some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge artists. In the crowd meanwhile, body glitter \u2013 hopefully biodegradable! \u2013 remains the accessory of choice. Milk and two sugars? Sheryl Crow generated some of the biggest singalongs of the day for the likes of If It Makes You Happy \u2013 and even had her two young sons working as guitar technicians. As Michael Cragg noted: \u201cBy the time the classic Everyday Is a Winding Road kicks in, she\u2019s back in the crowd\u2019s palm, posing for photos and even sharing a kiss with a sunburnt punter.\u201d Aside from walking about eight miles a day, yoga is the exercise of choice at Glastonbury \u2013 and Power Ballad Yoga adds an extra impetus for all those outstretched arms. George Ezra\u2019s buoyant, boyish music simply wouldn\u2019t make sense in Glastonbury\u2019s classic drizzle. But luckily for him \u2013 perhaps because of him? \u2013 the crowd was indeed firmly \u201cunderneath the hot sun\u201d for his set. As the Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes said: \u201cIn this miserable day and age, only a churl would resist Ezra\u2019s sunbeam blast of charisma.\u201d Bastille played a blinder, leaning into their set like headliners and making one of the clearest political statements of the day: singer Dan Smith draping himself in an EU flag. And there\u2019s still two more days to go!
