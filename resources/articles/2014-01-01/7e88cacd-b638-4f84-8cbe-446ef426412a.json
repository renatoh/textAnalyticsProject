He says you only go to the zoo to see lions, tigers, monkeys, penguins and now \u2013 presumably because of a certain price-comparison website \u2013 meerkats. I went to London zoo with my son the other day; we could take or leave the cats, to be honest. One of us \u2013 the right one \u2013 most appreciated (light) petting a goat. And we both very much enjoyed the snakes and lizards. Snakes are even better if you go to a zoo where they're a bit less worried about upsetting children. I remember an afternoon in Sri Lanka, watching snakes being fed live chicks. They go on cheep-cheeping as they go down. Also, Richard, have you really ever seen a pike (the freshwater fish) in a zoo? \"Yes,\" @richardosman tells me. (Isn't that the brilliant thing about Twitter, that you can ask people off the telly stupid questions?) Well, I think he's lying. Anyway, Frank Skinner spares Richard's \"zoo filler\" and mythical pike, and quite rightly puts comedian @roisinconaty's Bambi in Room 101 instead, though I don't agree with her reasons. She thinks children should be protected from death and the horrors of the world. I would very happily take my son to Colombo zoo (much cheaper entrance than London, too). Otherwise, it's a nice opener to the new series (number 14, can you believe it?). The other guest is Joan Bakewell \u2013 it's not often you get octogenarian ladies on comedy panel shows. And that should be applauded. One tiny moan on the subject of applause: I think panel-show contestants should be discouraged from applauding each other (there's a bit of that going on here), or even laughing at each other's jokes. It's both over-polite and a little bit smug: \"Oh you're so funny.\" \"No, you're so funny.\" That's what the audience is there for: to laugh and applaud, if they feel like it. I'd maybe put that into Room 101, if I went on. Otherwise very good, carry on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
