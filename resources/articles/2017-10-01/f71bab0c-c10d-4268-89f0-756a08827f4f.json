You can read our full story here: And in this post here, you can see links back to other gravitational wave explainers and stories we\u2019ve published. Thanks for joining me! A journalist asks why observation in radio waves is so significant. Tara Murphy explains: the radio emissions come from the shock as it passes through the gas and dust from the merger. \u201cSo you can build up a forensic picture of what the enviroment was like around the merger.\u201d A journalist asks what the significance is of no neutrinos being detected from the merger. Bailes explains that it probably did create a lot of neutrinos but they are hard to detect. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that neutrinos were generated but you need a cubic kilometre of ice,\u201d he says \u2013 to detect even a small number. Tara Murphy explains that having three detectors online now measuring the same event meant the researchers could more closely detect the location of the event, allowing astronomers to point their telescopes at it to observe it in the electromagnetic spectrum. Matthew Bailes explains that if scientists can observe a lot of events like this, they will be able to better describe the rate at which the universe is expanding. He argues that a detector built in Australia would help the international search. A journalist has asked what is meant by gold being generated in the merger. Eric Thane explains that elements heavier than iron can\u2019t be created in normal stars, and it remained a mystery where gold came from. But the glow from around this merger is an example of gold being created. Our photographer Mike Bowers is at the event: David Ottaway, OzGrav chief investigator at the University of Adelaide, is up now. He says future gravitational wave detectors will be twice as powerful as the ones used today \u2013 and researchers in Australia are key to making that possible. Ottaway is followed by Sue Thomas, CEO of the Australian Research Council , who opens the floor for questions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working around the clock for the last two months,\u201d says Tara Murphy, CAASTRO (the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics) chief investigator at the University of Sydney. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this for years.\u201d The radio waves we detect from the merger give us unique informaiton that we can\u2019t get in any other way, Murphy says. It helps complete the picture of \u201cextreme physics\u201d, she explains. She says ongoing observations will fill in gaps in our understanding. Eric Thrane, OzGrav data theme leader at Monash University, is up now. He said they had been able to measure the masses of the two neutron stars \u2013 between 1.2 and 1.6 times the mass of our own sun. \u201cA single teaspoon of neutron star matter weighs about a billion tonnes,\u201d he says. With all that matter, the electromagnetic spectrum had been \u201clit up\u201d he said, saying the event will become known as the best measured astronomical event yet. Thrane describes how the discovery solves the mystery of where gold comes from, with its creation not possible through more mundane astronomical events. He says it\u2019s amazing to think the gold in your wedding ring may have been forged in the furnace of the collision of two neutron stars. Scott explains that there have been four detections of gravitational waves from the collision of black holes. But the collision of neutron stars, with all the extra data they can provide, was what researchers were searching for, she says. \u201cThe age of multi-messenger astronomy has truly begun,\u201d she said. Prof Susan Scott, OzGrav chief Investigator at the Australian National University, is now at the podium. Prof Matthew Bailes \u2013 director of OzGrav (the ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery) at Swinburne University of Technology \u2013 has taken the stage. He says he wanted OzGrav to inspire the next generation of scintists. \u201cGravitational wave discovery is so difficult it is firmly in the realm of mega-science,\u201d Bailes says. \u201cBlack holes have no hair and don\u2019t leave astronomers with as much to look at.\u201d He says when he came across two neutron stars rotating around one another every eight minutes, which would collapse together in millions of years, he began a search for others that were closer to destruction. \u201cA neutron star pair that were impossibly compact entered the Ligo band,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event hailed a new era in astronomy. \u201cThe avalanche of science is unparalleled in modern astrophysics,\u201d he said, pointing out there are more than a dozen papers today about the discovery. Alan Finkel has begun addressing the meeting. He explains that when gravitational waves were discovered it was the result of the collision of two black holes. This time it was two neutron stars. But this is the first time we were able to work out where in the sky it occurred, and astronomers were able to turn their telescopes towards it. \u201cIt happened 130m years ago in a galaxy far far far away,\u201d Finkel explains, before introducing the panel, who you can see in the previous post. The discussion will moderated by Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and will involved the following Australian researchers: Prof Matthew Bailes \u2013 director of OzGrav (the ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery) at Swinburne University of Technology Prof Susan Scott \u2013 OzGrav chief Iivestigator at the Australian National University Assoc Prof David Ottaway \u2013 OzGrav chief Iinvestigator at the University of Adelaide Dr Eric Thrane \u2013 OzGrav data theme leader at Monash University Assoc Prof Tara Murphy \u2013 CAASTRO (the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics) chief investigator at the University of Sydney Prof Sue Thomas \u2013 CEO of the Australian Research Council (ARC) The press conference will be starting shortly but, while you wait, why not go back and read the exciting discovery of the first direct detection of gravitational waves? Or our explainer: \u201cEverything you need to know about gravitational waves.\u201d Are you left wondering \u201cWhat does it even mean for there to be ripples in spacetime\u201d? Well, then you could flip back through our Q&amp;A between readers and the astrophysicist Katie Mack, who broke down last year\u2019s discovery for us, question-by-question. Hailed as the dawn of a new era in astronomy, the source of gravitational waves have been \u201cseen\u201d for the first time. After ripples in the fabric of spacetime were detected by the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, astronomers all around the world set their sights on the source. The immense collision of two neutron stars was then witnessed not just as gravitational waves, but also in light \u2013 in the optical, ultraviolet, infrared, x-ray and radio spectrums. It has been described as \u201cthe most intensely observed astronomical event to date\u201d. Many Australian gravitational-wave hunters were centrally involved in the discovery. From 9am Sydney time, we\u2019ll bring you live coverage from a special news briefing moderated by Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel.
