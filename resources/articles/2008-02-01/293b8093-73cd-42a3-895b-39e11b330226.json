TechCrunch notes that: \"Google Sites looks absolutely nothing like Jotspot, other than the fact that both are hosted wikis. All of the structured data templates launched by Jotspot in July 2006 have been stripped out.\" Many say it looks more like Google Pages. Another common complaint is that Google Sites requires Google Apps. At ZD Net blogs, Dennis Howlett reviewed the product in Google Sites - spoiled by usability issues, and complains that it's \"dog slow\". He says: After 16 months at Google developer's hands, the outcome is substandard. This is such a pity. In its JotSpot incarnation, it was far from perfect but that didn't matter because JotSpot was shedding light on a new way of collaborating. Since passing into Google's hands, the guts have been ripped out and then re-assembled with as much Google 'stuff' as they could cram in but rushed to completion. At the very least, Google should get rid of the gadgets addition facility and rework it. Otherwise, I sense the SMBs at which it is aimed will find the service a turn off. If a gutsy start-up is trying to do something new, people will cut it a lot of slack, as they did Jotspot. When a megacorporation appears to be muscling into a market with an inferior product, they generally won't. Maybe Google is now being held accountable for delivering products to a standard commensurate with its size and market power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
