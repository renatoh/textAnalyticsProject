The TV sport channels are currently in what we doctors call July-denial, scheduling hours of the stuff for fellow sufferers. On Saturday, for instance, the true monomaniac could flip to the start of the Rangers v Hearts Scottish Premier League match at the very moment that Sachin Tendulkar was walking out to bat at Lord's on Sky Sports 1, and by the time Graeme Swann was swooping to catch Sachin out, be watching Arsenal on ESPN looking impressive in a friendly against Cologne, holding out the possibility they may be the first team in English football to peak before the August bank holiday. Football cravings are a little trickier to satisfy midweek, unless you tune to Talksport where the non-stop, 24-hour-a-day phone-in on the future of Cesc F\u00e1bregas is now into week six, only briefly interrupted for the Murdochs' appearance before the parliamentary select committee, covered on the excellent Hawksbee and Jacobs show. A rare appearance during daylight hours for Talksport's political editor (yes, there is one) was prefaced by Hawksbee saying to him: \"This is your cup final, isn't it?\" neatly indicating to Talksport listeners that here was a story nearly as important as the possibility of Luka Modric moving from Spurs to Chelsea. By the weekend, however, you almost envied the closed world of Talksport's football obsessives, as it became impossible to know where to direct your attention. Certainly, Sky's opening caption on day one of the Test against India, IT.. DOESN'T..GET..BIGGER..THAN..THIS, spelled out in huge letters across the screen was beginning to look a slightly wobbly premise \u2013 depending on what you take IT to mean \u2013 as famine in Africa, massacre in Norway, and the death of a talented young singer, all laid claim to being BIGGER. The problem with Test match cricket is that you never really know how BIG it is until it is over \u2013 history is usually the judge \u2013 and the drawn-out format invites those of us with itchy remote fingers to wander elsewhere \u2013 at least until the final act. Not only were the news channels demanding attention on Saturday, but a cracking rugby league cup tie, not to mention three football matches, provided powerful competition for the Test. In a discussion on Test cricket's uncertain future, Sky's two Mikes (Atherton and Holding) conceded that a Test match has to be pretty special to warrant undivided attention over five days. Moreover, though Test cricket might still be the gold standard here, said Atherton, it is crumbling in the rest of the world. Holding felt much of it was \"masquerading as cricket of a high order\", and recommended a league system with the top six nations playing each other home and away, throwing a bone to nations like Bangladesh and New Zealand with an ad hoc Test or two. The Mikeys reckoned, as did the Davids, Gower and Lloyd, and Ian Botham, that while short-form cricket paid the rent, Test matches built reputations, a not altogether unsurprising verdict from five players whose reputations had been built on Test cricket. It was the ebb and flow of a Test series, said Gower, that gave the format its unique appeal. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the famous series exactly 30 years ago that became known as Botham's Ashes. The BBC, which loves an anniversary more than Hallmark cards, celebrated the '81 series with a documentary the quality of which could be gauged by the calibre of talking head. It was way above the normal cast of dismal stand-ups, quasi-experts, and Terry Christian (I have to own up to having occasionally done a little clips show work myself, but I blame society, and the 250 quid I was offered), featuring Stephen Fry, John Major, Elton John, and Mick Jagger. The programme's premise that the Ashes series was somehow relief from the political and economic turmoil of 1981 was of course nonsense, but did not make the show any less entertaining. I particularly enjoyed Jagger's contribution, doing the voice almost as well as Phil Cornwell used to do it in Stella Street, although I should have thought a lyric interpreter like Jagger might have made a better fist of pronouncing the Yiddish word chutzpah. The Rolling Stones frontman and cricket enthusiast said Botham had the \"chut-spar\" (enunciated like a member of the Townswomen's Guild talking about chutney) to take on the Aussies when all seemed lost. For future reference Mick, it's chutzpah, like a particularly catarrhal pronunciation of the Premier League team Tottenham Chutzpah \u2013 whose pre-season friendly against Orlando Pirates, incidentally, on ESPN was yet another distraction from the cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
