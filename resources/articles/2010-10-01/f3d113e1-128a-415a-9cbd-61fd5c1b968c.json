Until somebody has found a safe way not just of storing but of disposing of waste in a world [with] increasing numbers of mad groups who go around trying to blow up other people, we really ought to be doing something that doesn't have all the risks of nuclear power.\" And he is equally scathing about the Con-Dem housing policies. Do you think the deputy leader is comfortable with this coalition thing? \u2022 Hughes needs a good spin doctor to explain that this is just the new politics. Finsbury PR, maybe. They are hot; award winners. The latest, courtesy of the charity Survival International, is the PR Disaster of the Year award for the company's work on behalf of the British mining company Vedanta Resources. Vedanta had exciting plans to build a bauxite mine in the hills of Niyamgiri, near Orissa, India \u2013 which would, it was claimed, have devastated the lives of indigenous tribes there and threatened the ecosystem. Despite the spinners insisting that the company had adhered throughout to best practice, celebrities such as Joanna Lumley and Michael Palin spoke out against it. And the high point, from Finsbury's point of view, must have been when the Independent wondered whether Vedanta was, in fact, \"the most hated company in the world\". Vedanta and Finsbury lost, because the Indian government blocked the proposal, but it was top-notch work in the battle for public opinion. The surgery was a great success. Shame about the patient. \u2022 Finsbury could offer its services to Father Stephen Bould, whose parish in Folkestone, Kent, may be the first to defect wholesale from the Church of England to Rome because of the former's embrace of female bishops. But, for all the days in the media spotlight, he says he is coping. We raise with him the fact that his late mother attained the position of overseer in the Quakers \u2013 the equivalent of a bishop. But he says we, like so many critics, misunderstand his position. He offers no criticism, implied or otherwise, on the capabilities of women. \"We keep saying it, but people don't believe it.\" The public is like that. A job for Finsbury, we think. \u2022 And only the planning of a Coulson, a Mandelson or perhaps a Finsbury could have ensured that Georgie Osborne would spell out his savagery towards the public finances on World Statistics Day. Today, the Royal Statistical Society launches Getstats, a 10-year campaign to build statistical understanding across society. That should be good for George. But it isn't so good for George. Because Ipsos Mori research released to coincide with it also shows that more than half of us look particularly askance at government figures and suspect the stats they give out have all been subject to political interference. It is into this prevailing wind then, that he sets sail later today. Lifejackets everybody. \u2022 Confusion on the Isle of Wight after our item recalling a visit to Parkhurst, the maximum security jail, by the late Dame Joan Sutherland. The memory came from a former inmate who remembered her performance and her lack of airs and graces. Which was nice. But time does things to the memory, and checks on the island have failed to bring forth any further details of a visit by Dame Joan Sutherland. All that can be found is a visit to Parkhurst in 1964 by the celebrated soprano, Dame Joan Hammond. So many Dame Joans, so long ago. Add to the mix another female star, Joan Rhodes, who also performed at Parkhurst, and you begin to see the problem. Her forte was tearing up telephone books and bending bits of metal. Our former inmate could have been thinking of her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
