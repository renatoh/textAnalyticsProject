The piece does one of the things that video art can do best \u2013 expand cinema into multiple time frames and points of view. Documenting the musical performances of people far from their homes, the four-screen work plays out the water drumming of a woman from Cameroon in a swimming pool, an Algerian man playing a broken Casio keyboard on the Paris Metro, a Mongolian man playing a stringed instrument and throat singing on a city street and a Sudanese taxi driver whistling a melancholy tune. That Mesiti\u2019s video installation has taken the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s acquisitive award in what must be the weakest year of the prize thus far should not detract from the fact that Citizen\u2019s Band is an elegant, beautiful and affecting piece. The cinematography is restrained, the editing unobtrusive. It\u2019s a great work. The Landa is now a decade old: launched in 2004, it highlighted some of the energetic video work that was being produced by a generation of mostly younger artists in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, while the acquisitive part of the prize also helped to bolster the AGNSW\u2019s collection. Its first few iterations showcased a selection of curated finalists, each of whom could have easily and deservedly won the prize. Early winners such as David Rozetsky\u2019s Untouchable in 2004 and Monika Tichacek\u2019s The Shadowers in 2006 tilted the prize toward elaborate video-installation pieces. In many ways, 2013 Landa curator Charlotte Day has taken things back to basics: gone are the huge installations and furniture pieces of early years and instead we have some very modest installations, sculptures and screen works. Day decided to look at the idea of performance in video and new media: there are artists doing things and then recording them, like Kate Mitchell\u2019s jumping-through-glass multiscreen sculpture Lucky Break, or Lauren Brincat\u2019s High Horse, where the artist stands for ages on the back of a horse; and artists recording other people doing things, as in James Newitt\u2019s We Are The People, a documentation of a staged demonstration, and Laresa Kosloff\u2019s Eternal Situation, a video that documents visitors wandering through the \u2018old paintings\u2019 section of the AGNSW to Whitney Houston warbling I Have Nothing Without You. On one level this was an inevitable curatorial angle to take, since performance-video has been one of the strongest aspects of contemporary art in Australia, and there are many artists young and old making compelling performance based works. But one can hardly claim that this practice is in any way new \u2013 or \"renewed\" as Day carefully claims in the catalogue. The recording of performance by film or video, through sound or by documentation, is at least 50 years old \u2013 longer in the case of cinema and photography \u2013 and some pieces such as Alicia Frankovich\u2019s Free Time/Opportune Spectator, a wall of framed texts and a daily, scheduled performance, are virtually \u201cmedia\u201d free. That stretch of curatorial logic undermines the show with a selection of mostly lacklustre works that are either pastiches of much better works by better artists elsewhere \u2013 Newitt\u2019s work looks pretty weak compared to Jeremy Deller\u2019s Battle of Orgreave from 2001 \u2013 or are not very good examples of work by talented artists, Mitchell\u2019s work an unfortunate example. The cramped staging of the show, a far cry from the Landa\u2019s early days as a major event at the gallery, adds to the exhibition\u2019s shortcomings, with unfortunate sound bleeds from that bloody Whitney Houston song wafting into to the rest of the show, and hardly enough room to step back and consider individual works. Maybe the Landa\u2019s next outing in 2015 will feature real new media, or perhaps it\u2019ll just settle back into framing the impressive practice of Australian video art, and not worry too much about the chimerical idea of trying to justify the works as \u2018new\u2019. As Mesiti\u2019s Citizen\u2019s Band demonstrates, there\u2019s still plenty of life in the medium yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
