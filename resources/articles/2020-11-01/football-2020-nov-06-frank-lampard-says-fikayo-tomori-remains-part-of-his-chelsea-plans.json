Tomori, who was open to the idea of furthering his development by going on loan this season, has had to be patient since rejecting West Ham on the final day of the transfer window. The 22-year-old, who was also targeted by Everton in the summer, has not started a Premier League game since February and faces an uncertain future given that Chelsea\u2019s squad contains five centre-backs. The situation was complicated by Antonio R\u00fcdiger seeing potential moves to Milan, Roma and Tottenham fall through last month. R\u00fcdiger has forced his way back into contention since then and Tomori did not even make the bench for Chelsea\u2019s last two league games. Yet Lampard said he was happy to see Tomori stay, even though he has handed him only one substitute appearance in the league this season. \u201cI think there\u2019s arguments on both sides,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cFikayo is our contracted player. We know that West Ham were interested. Fikayo took the decision not to go and that\u2019s well within his rights. That had no bearing on my thoughts at all. He\u2019s still a developing player. \u201cWhen I say developing, he\u2019s had a great two years. He got himself in the England team, was one of the best defenders in the Championship and then played 20-plus games for Chelsea. It\u2019s normal for a young player sometimes, in a squad as competitive as ours, where there are periods where you maybe aren\u2019t playing every week.\u201d Lampard took Tomori on loan to Derby in the 2018-19 season and gave him plenty of opportunities last season. \u201cI\u2019ve got no problem with Fikayo,\u201d he said. \u201cI rely on him. That\u2019s clear from when I took him to Derby and how I handled him last year. He\u2019s been a fantastic player for me. He trains very well and when he gets his opportunity, like he had when he came on against Liverpool and in the Carabao Cup, it\u2019s important he takes them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
