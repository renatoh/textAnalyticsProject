How do I make the best of a stupid situation?", "bodyText": "My husband of a dozen years, boyfriend of almost twice that, insists on wearing his hair parted in the middle. I hate it. Always have, always will. I have asked him a number of times to wear it differently: tousled, somewhat side part, shorter without any part, just anything other than the way it is. He sometimes complies but it usually always goes back to the blasted middle part. And while this is terribly shallow on my end, it is seriously impacting my perception of him. He will step through the door, and I have to avert my eyes, as I find him seriously unattractive due to the way he wears his hair. I have tried to focus instead on his many great qualities, as well as remember how it used to be when I found him attractive. I try to redirect my thoughts from the anger and disappointment I feel every time I see him anew. It seems to me he isn\u2019t willing to explore a look that would work for both of us. So how do I make the best of a stupid situation? I think the best place to start is by asking: why is he so committed to the centre part? One possibility is he\u2019s performing the unattractiveness precisely for that purpose. I think a lot of us feel (or hope) that in real love, like the one that\u2019s kept you two together for so many decades, we shouldn\u2019t have to brush our hair and put our shiniest self on in order to strike our spouse as beautiful or worth loving. We want to seem lovely to them however we do our hair. As age moves in and our body spreads in new directions, like a ball of dough dropped from a great height, it becomes harder for us to feel like we\u2019ll manage to be attractive, even if we try. You see where this leads: if we already resent that our partner can see us as unattractive, and if we\u2019re not confident that aesthetic effort will pay off for us, one natural reaction is to throw a middle finger to the whole exercise and part your hair down the centre. To say: \u201cIf I\u2019m not trying I can\u2019t fail and anyway I shouldn\u2019t have to try.\u201d The problem is, it\u2019s working. He\u2019s succeeded in striking you as unattractive. And if I\u2019m right, and that was kind of the point all along, then you saying you find it unattractive won\u2019t hit his ears as a reason to stop doing it. It just hardens the case for rebellion: \u2018You think I\u2019m unattractive? Watch this.\u2019 The discussion about whether the centre part actually looks good is just surface debris at this point. The big question is what the tectonic disagreement underneath it is. For him it might be the way the part symbolises some independence, or a refusal to play the game of attractiveness. For you it might be about his repeated disregard for a fairly minor preference. I think the job is to get to that tectonic level. Make clear that your love for him doesn\u2019t hang in the balance, and don\u2019t let him retreat into the aesthetics of it. He\u2019s defended this centre part with a doggedness we reserve for things that really matter, and no one thinks a centre part seriously matters. So for him it must symbolise something more. If you can get to what that is, you can find some other way for him to achieve it. One that doesn\u2019t make you wince when he walks through the door. Perhaps there\u2019s another minor change you could offer in return, so it doesn\u2019t just feel like one of you attacking the other. Who knows, perhaps he\u2019d really like it if you wore your hair parted in the middle. ************************************* Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?
