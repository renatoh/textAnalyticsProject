The suddenness with which it all happened had not been foreseen by the intelligence services of the USA or Europe or of the Soviet Union itself. But when it happened, it had a dramatic effect on all intelligence professionals in both east and west. In December 1991, I was asked to make our first friendly contact with the KGB. Some months before, Douglas Hurd, then foreign secretary, had met Vadim Bakatin, whom Mikhail Gorbachev had put in charge of the KGB following the failed coup against him. He asked him, in the spirit of the times, if he would like some people from the British security service to go over and talk to the KGB about working in a democracy. He said he would. I was delighted to be asked to lead the team. We were three: myself; a colleague from MI5, a man who had spent much of his security service career in counterespionage work against the Soviet intelligence services and whose hatred of communism was matched only by his love of Russia and its language; and an official from the Home Office. It was breathtaking for me, after more than 20 years spent combating the activities of Soviet intelligence, to be setting off to Moscow to meet them for what we hoped would be friendly talks. We were met at Sheremetyevo airport by a KGB team led by a man whom, I found out later when I got back home again, I had already come across once before. He had been a member of the KGB office in New Delhi in the 1960s when I was a locally engaged clerk-typist working in the MI5 office there and, as one was required to do, I had written a note, which was faithfully stored on a file in the registry, reporting that I had encountered him. There he was, clutching a small bunch of red roses. I gathered later that they had agonised over whether, as a senior professional woman, I would be insulted or flattered to be offered flowers. We stayed with the British ambassador, Rodric Braithwaite, in the embassy just across the river from the Kremlin. We arrived just as winter gripped Moscow, and from my bedroom window I watched as, over the few days we were there, the river turned first to ice and then to a snow field. There was a sense of complete unreality in the embassy. Everything was changing incredibly fast and no one knew what would happen next. The USSR was in its terminal stages (by the end of December it had ceased to exist) and the leaders of the Soviet republics had agreed to form the Commonwealth of Independent States, but what that would mean in practice was not clear at all. Out on the street, there was every sign of economic breakdown. Little old ladies were selling a single tin of soup or a pair of worn shoes. In the Gum department store practically all the shelves were empty. No one knew what the rouble was worth, and prices at the tourist stalls in the Arbat, where we bought the then current version of the Russian doll (a big Yeltsin, containing Gorbachev, Khrushchev, Stalin and a tiny Lenin in the middle) varied minute by minute. Inside the British embassy, security rules were still in force, but it was as though the old enemy was beginning to lose its teeth. So though we went into the safe room to discuss with the embassy staff the strategy for our meetings, and though everyone was still conscious that there were microphones everywhere and that all the Russian staff were working for the KGB, there was far less concern about what they overheard than there had been. At dinner in the embassy dining room on our first night there, conscious that we were being overheard, we spoke quite openly about the KGB and how we judged that they were reacting to the new situation. I caught one of the women who were serving our dinner looking at a colleague and raising her eyes to the heavens at our conversation - or was it to the large crystal chandelier which hung over the table and was no doubt picking up everything we said? Our meetings with the KGB were held in their headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square, a complex of large, forbidding buildings which also includes what had been the Lubyanka prison, over the years a place of imprisonment, torture and death. We were shown to a meeting room, where Bakatin welcomed us at the door. At a long conference table, what seemed like an immense line of KGB officers, all male of course, was drawn up on one side. Four rather isolated chairs had been placed on our side, for the three of us and our interpreter. There was an eerie atmosphere as we sized each other up, and there was much smiling and handshaking and remarks about historic moments. But in fact, on both sides, we were rather like wild animals suddenly being presented with their prey in circumstances where they couldn't eat it. We went through our description of the laws and regulations which controlled the activities of the intelligence agencies in the UK. These were met with polite incredulity by our KGB interlocutors. I then made my requests. Over the years, members of the staff of the British embassy in Moscow and their families, who for the most part lived in blocks of flats reserved for the staff of foreign embassies, had been subject to harassment of various descriptions. It was clearly done either by or with the tacit support of the KGB. Flats had been entered when their occupants were out and obvious signs of someone's presence had been left around. Freezers had been turned off, and small things broken. Possessions had been removed and returned on another occasion - a favourite trick was to take away one shoe of a pair and then bring it back a few weeks later. Quite frequently, the tyres of diplomatic cars parked outside flats were punctured, or other damage was done. The idea, presumably, was to frighten and unsettle the people concerned. Sometimes the harassment was more threatening. When diplomats or their wives were driving in and around Moscow, they were very frequently followed by surveillance cars; that was expected, but sometimes those cars drove dangerously and threateningly close or even, apparently on purpose, hit the car they were following. My request was that if, in this post-cold war era, we were to get closer and cooperate, that sort of behaviour should stop. Bakatin's response to my opening remarks was friendly and welcoming. As for my request, he said that he would do what he could to look into the harassment, but in a surprisingly frank admission of his position, he added that he doubted whether he would be able to do anything about it. In the gaps between our meetings, we went sightseeing in temperatures colder than I had experienced. While we did so, we were followed around by some part of the KGB, clearly not the A team, as they were fairly conspicuous. As well as the request for an end to harassment, I wanted to establish what scope there was for a reduction in the espionage attack by the KGB on this country. It seemed to me not unreasonable to expect that if the cold war was over, there should be less aggressive spying. This was a matter for the First Chief Directorate, the foreign intelligence arm of the KGB, so on the second evening of our stay, the head of the First Chief Directorate, Yevgeny Primakov, later Russia's foreign minister and briefly prime minister, invited me to a meeting to discuss that topic. My small party and I drove in the ambassador's Rolls-Royce to what seemed in the dark to be a rather leafy suburb, to what I took to be a KGB safe house. It was difficult to avoid the feeling that we had somehow slipped into a James Bond film. It was a dark, cold and snowy night. As I was taking off my snow boots in the hall, Primakov materialised on the stairs to welcome us. We went upstairs to a lamplit sitting room, furnished with heavy curtains and drapery behind which anything could have been lurking. We had a brief, rather cool discussion. Primakov made it very clear that I was barking up completely the wrong tree. Espionage would continue to be necessary, for the defence of Russia, and they would continue to engage in it at whatever level they chose. We called it a day before too long, and he disappeared behind the draperies. We went once more to that house the next evening for a farewell dinner with our new KGB \"friends\" and the ambassador. Primakov did not reappear, but a fair cross section of the others we had met did. Much champagne was drunk on that occasion, and innumerable toasts, with many references to the number of women in top positions in the UK, along the lines of, \"Your queen is a lady, your prime minister is a lady and now in MI5, dear Mrs Rimington, we have a lady.\" Bakatin lasted only another six months, and by January 1992 his imminent departure was announced. But when my own appointment as director-general of MI5 was made public, shortly after our visit to Moscow, he was still head of the KGB. Among all the congratulations I received, the letter from him was the one I most enjoyed. It seemed the crowning unexpectedness of that whole unexpected period. \u0095 \u00a9 Stella Rimington 2001.
