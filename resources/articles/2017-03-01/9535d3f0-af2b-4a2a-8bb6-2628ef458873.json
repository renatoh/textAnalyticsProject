Many of the 300 or so residents of Anderson\u2019s hometown of Goodooga rely on welfare, he says. Exorbitant electricity bills \u2013 up to $3,000 a quarter for some households \u2013 further exacerbate the poverty. \u201cWe\u2019re always at the end of the power line, so the service that is there is quite extraordinary in terms of cost.\u201d Many other communities rely on expensive, emissions-intensive diesel-powered generators to meet their electricity demands. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem and we need to make sure that we fix this,\u201d Anderson says. To that end, Anderson and 24 other Indigenous leaders have formed the First Nations Renewable Energy Alliance, which aims to tackle high power costs and entrenched disadvantage \u2013 along with climate change \u2013 by pushing for renewable energy in Indigenous communities. The alliance, formed at the Community Energy Congress in Melbourne last month, will lobby government and partner with private enterprise and other community energy alliances to support Indigenous communities looking to transition to renewable energy. Anderson, who is a member of the alliance\u2019s seven-member steering committee, says the move is an important step towards self-sufficiency for Indigenous communities. The renewable energy company 360 Energy Group, which is based in Melbourne, has stepped up with $10,000 and an offer of office space and knowhow to help get the alliance off the ground. Its director, Michael Anthony, sees immense potential for renewables \u2013 such as solar or wind power generation combined with battery storage \u2013 to empower remote communities. Renewables, he says, can \u201cprovide communities with a really strong, consistent, stable power solution at about half the cost of [current] solutions\u201d. Whereas high energy prices often drive Indigenous people off their traditional lands, lower-cost renewables can help communities to thrive no matter how remote. \u201cWe can build a power station where the community exists,\u201d Anthony says, \u201cso people are able to successfully live in the environment the way they want to live and have access to power which enables them to better determine their economic future.\u201d Only a handful of Indigenous communities have embarked on renewable energy projects in Australia. The Indigenous-owned and -operated company AllGrid Energy, for instance, has installed solar panels and battery storage systems to replace diesel generators in the Aboriginal communities of Ngurrara and Kurnturlpara in the Northern Territory\u2019s Barkly Tableland. Within two months of the system being installed in May 2016, people were moving back to their homelands from Tennant Creek, the communities growing from just two permanent residents to about 40. The Murrawarri elder Fred Hooper, also on the alliance steering committee, is hoping that Australian Indigenous communities can follow the lead of other Indigenous communities around the world. In Canada\u2019s First Nations communities, for instance, renewable energy projects are becoming commonplace. \u201cIt\u2019s very inspiring,\u201d he says. Melina Laboucan-Massimo, from the Lubicon Cree First Nation in Alberta, Canada, has led the push for her own community of Little Buffalo \u2013 which lies at the heart of the Peace river oil sands \u2013 to adopt renewable energy after a 2011 oil spill just 10km from the township. A 20.8kW solar installation, built and operated by locals, now powers the community health centre. Additional projects are being planned to wean the community off the propane heating and coal-powered electricity that it relies on. Laboucan-Massimo, who is a member of Canada\u2019s Indigenous Clean Energy Network, has seen the benefits that alliances can provide. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to share information,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause, when you\u2019re dealing with companies, or utilities, it\u2019s really good to know what\u2019s being told to one community or what kind of deals are being offered.\u201d The First Nations Renewable Energy Alliance will go one step further, working with community leaders and acting as a conduit between the communities and the businesses they are dealing with. This is essential, says Anderson, to avoid predatory practices they have seen in the past, with companies \u201cplaying on the psychology of poverty\u201d to gain advantage. The alliance has drafted protocols and memoranda of understanding that will guide how companies engage with Indigenous communities for renewable energy projects. While lowering the cost of energy is a high priority for remote Indigenous communities, the environmental credentials of renewables are also an important consideration, says Hooper. \u201cOne of the best things about renewable energies is that it\u2019s relying on natural sun from the sky, wind that\u2019s blowing across the landscape and other renewable energies are not raping our mother earth of the precious resources that she holds,\u201d he says. One of the next steps for the alliance will be to identify a community that can act as a test case for a renewables project. \u201cOur experience is that if we can make it work for one community, it will work in every other community,\u201d Anderson says."}, "isHosted": false}}}
