Redstone, by some accounts in very poor health, is said by his former caretaker, Manuela Herzer, to be suffering from much more serious declines in his abilities than the company has indicated. Previously a reliable presence on the company\u2019s earnings calls, he has not spoken to investors on one since November 2014. Activist investor SpringOwl Asset Management is campaigning publicly against Dauman, Redstone, and Viacom\u2019s \u201coverpaid and lackey board\u201d, according to a presentation to investors. Philippe Dauman, chief executive officer of Viacom, also saw a reduction in pay: his bonus was cut from $18.9m to $14m. Dauman\u2019s salary was cut by 85%, according to Broadcasting &amp; Cable, which said the company offered the salary information in response to the suit questioning Redstone\u2019s competence. \u201cViacom has the oldest directors on average compared to any of their media peers at 66 (except for CBS),\u201d the presentation said, noting that median pay for outside directors at the company was $314,000 \u2013 higher than at Disney, Time Warner, Fox, Scripps and AMC. \u201cDid MTV get the idea for Cribs from the habits of Viacom directors?\u201d \u201cWe believe almost 75% of the VIAB [Viacom\u2019s ticker symbol] board are not independent by a reasonable definition,\u201d the investor presentation concluded after offering a long list of directors it said were not independent. The investors went on to scold the company for overpaying Dauman and Tom Dooley, chief operating officer. \u201cIs Dauman really worth 30% more than Disney\u2019s Bob Iger?\u201d they asked in the presentation, noting that more than half of Dauman\u2019s compensation \u2013 a contractual $40m a year through 2018 \u2013 is in cash, not shares of the company. The charges against Dauman and the rest of Viacom\u2019s leadership go well beyond simply lining their own pockets: SpringOwl said Viacom management had sold its hit cartoon SpongeBob Squarepants to Netflix for too little, too early, taking children away from all-important revenue-generating advertisements. The investors also allege that Viacom mishandled its stake in new-media company Vice, organized by former CEO Tom Freston (and subsequently bought out by Freston after Redstone fired him). More seriously, the shareholders pointed out that Viacom has been dropped by 60 separate rural cable operators, cutting into its passive income from cable subscriptions that simply don\u2019t include Nickelodeon, MTV or Comedy Central anymore. And again, SpringOwl insinuated \u2013 as did Herzer in her suit \u2013 that Redstone is not responsible for his decisions at all. The group included as evidence a picture of a document ostensibly signed by Redstone in which his signature is a single wavy line that runs off the page. Through his company National Amusements, Redstone has been a major force in the American entertainment industry for 40 years, controlling not just Viacom, owner of Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central, among other assets, but broadcast network CBS and its assets, as well. Redstone conducted a successful hostile takeover bid in 1987, when he beat out a management-led investor group with a $3.4bn offer for the company in what an analyst characterized at the time as \u201ca war of attrition\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
