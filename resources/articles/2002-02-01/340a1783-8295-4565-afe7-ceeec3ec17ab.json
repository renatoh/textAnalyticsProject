Geordieland's true monarch will have come and gone by then. King Kev makes his first high-profile return to St James' Parktomorrow and, make no mistake, this is Newcastle's royal event of the year. Even if Newcastle United were to go on and win the Premiership this season under Bobby Robson, there would still be those here who consider Kevin Keegan's return as the moment of 2002. They are agog on the Tyne. Keegan will not be surprised. He once said that he taught himself to expect \"the most extreme reaction in any given set of circumstances\" from Newcastle fans. So he probably knew Newcastle's evening paper, the Chronicle, would run a daily feature called \"Countdown to Keegan\" from the moment Manchester City were drawn against Newcastle in the fifth round of the FA Cup. When Keegan speaks to the press after the game, he will be standing opposite a framed copy of that paper from the day Keegan signed as a player in 1982. It says simply: \"Here he is!\" Here he'll be again. Beneath Keegan's picture in that paper is the story of his Geordie grandfather Frank, a miner who became a hero during a pit collapse in Durham on this very day, February 16, 1909. Keegan's father Joe was also a Geordie and Keegan always regarded himself as one, despite being born in Yorkshire. \"Your roots are your roots,\" he said. Since the day he left as manager five years and one month ago, Keegan has revisited those roots for Peter Beardsley's testimonial, but he did not speak publicly and was deliberately low-key. He did not speak when he departed as manager either, so there is unfinished business. How different his first exit was. As a Newcastle player in 1984, Keegan left St James' Park in a helicopter, his No7 shirt dropped from the sky to the hordes below. That is the drama Geordies associate with Keegan, and the reason why people queued around St James' Park for tickets for tomorrow night's game. If this is baffling to those outside the north-east who perceive Keegan's time as Newcastle manager as an expensive failed experiment, and who primarily think of him as an inadequate England manager, then the views of five reliable witnesses of Keegan's Tyneside era may help explain Keegan's unique hold on the area. Mobbed Glenn Roeder, now the manager of West Ham, was a player with Keegan at St James'. \"I actually lived with him for six months in the Gosforth Park hotel,\" Roeder said. \"He gave me free boarding on the condition that I made him a cup of tea every morning. Me, him, Terry McDermott and Dave McCreery spent a lot of afternoons together. \"Mainly we avoided the town because whenever Kevin went there he was mobbed. But then he was mobbed wherever he went. Maybe I shouldn't say it, but I joined Newcastle partly because of Kevin Keegan, to play with him. He didn't disappoint. \"That's why the people loved him. He created a carnival - the closest thing I ever saw to it was flying into Rome with Paul Gascoigne and all those Lazio supporters waiting. Kevin made himself part of Geordie folklore; I think he means to Newcastle what Shankly meant to Liverpool.\" If that last comparison sounds like hyperbole to some, given Shankly and Keegan's respective trophy tally, Mark Lawrenson, who was a coach under Keegan at Newcastle, is not one of them. \"That is valid,\" Lawrenson said, \"because Kevin gave people pride. He gave the region a smile. \"When he was Newcastle manager, there was always something happening and so the fans thought they always had hope. To be in Newcastle the day they beat Man U 5-0, it was like they had won the World Cup with nine men. \"Even what is considered his biggest mistake, scrapping the reserves, I could see the logic in that. Barcelona don't have a reserve team. But the question is, would a local lad like Michael Carrick have joined Newcastle if they had a reserve team? I think he would. You only have to miss out on one good one and it's a mistake. \"But Kevin was very open with the fans. He sold Andy Cole but he came down on to the steps and explained why, asked them to believe he knew where he was going and to stay with him. That inspires great trust. Sunday night will be one of those occasions when you want to be in your seat five minutes before Keegan walks down the tunnel. \"The thing about Newcastle fans is that they love that kind of hero, people with something about them. I played in the helicopter game - it was against Liverpool - with the likes of Dalglish, Souness. It was like a bloody cup tie.\" Keegan's last game in charge was an FA Cup tie, at Charlton. It was on a Sunday and a morning paper had broken the news that Keegan had offered to resign. Keegan did not want to face the press after and asked Lawrenson to go instead. \"I said: 'But they'll want to speak to you.'\" Twenty-four hours later Keegan was gone. \"I am a bit reluctant to use the analogy, but it was like someone close had died,\" Lawrenson said of that morning's training. \"I think Peter Beardsley did say that. It was surreal.\" \"It was a total shock,\" said Rob Lee, who scored the last goal of the Keegan era at Charlton and was, according to Keegan, his best ever signing. \"We thought the stuff in the papers was just talk. I didn't get hold of him for a couple of days and just wished him well. \"I wish I knew the truth why he left. I still don't know. He saved the club from extinction and they should have done everything to keep him. If he'd stayed we'd have won the league by now.\" Charisma Lee's first encounter with Keegan famously centred on Keegan telling Lee that Newcastle was closer to London than Middlesbrough, who also wanted to sign him. \"I only went up there to talk, but he said he already had a press conference arranged. He had such charisma I'd have signed anything. A week later me, my wife and baby were being driven around Newcastle by Kevin Keegan looking at places to live, in his car eating Midget Gems.\" Lee may not have known the precise reasons for Keegan's second going, but Jonathan Tulloch, a novelist who wrote The Season Ticket about two poor young lads from Gateshead trying to get into St James' Park, offered an insight into the conflict Keegan was encountering at boardroom level. \"We approached Kevin about making a charity record and he was brilliant,\" said Tulloch. \"He was referring to the directors as 'them up there' and said quite a few things about them. I think he was upset that Newcastle United were being turned into a trade name. Freddie Fletcher [then chief executive] came in and was spitting feathers. You could see the friction. \"Keegan was on the people's side in the way the directors weren't. He means a lot to the area because he understood that for them football was about self-esteem. Basically one of the oldest parts of the industrial world was in decline and football represented the last flower of that old sense of cooperation and community. Keegan might not have articulated it that way but he certainly understood it. \"That's why the name Keegan represents something and there are loads of children called Keegan here. A dynamic personality, he touches people.\" Sean Hunter is one of those. A season ticket holder at St James', he was married in the stadium last September. However, he foresees difficulties tomorrow night. \"We'll want to win and that means a bit of divided loyalty. But if we lose then it's Keegan I want to see winning the Cup. I still don't fully understand why he walked away, but what he did for us was tremendous. The night he lost it with Alex Ferguson on TV was great, just Keegan. He was angry. He spoke for every Geordie that night.\" Tomorrow they, and Keegan, will speak again. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
