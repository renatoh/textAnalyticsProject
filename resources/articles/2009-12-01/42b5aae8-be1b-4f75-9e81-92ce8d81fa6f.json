There could hardly be a better representation of different eras of goth-rock. Placebo are the old stagers, still romanticising emotional pain through grindingly bleak electro-rock, while the young Horrors take the same dysfunctional premise and go off on an arty, Teutonic tangent. One of the rock stories of the year has been the younger group's progression from schlocky jokers to inventive Mercury-prize nominees. The praise has emboldened them \u2013 where once they huddled together on stage, here they spread out, making the most of the arena's big space, and accenting it with darts of red light. Their brief but vivid set is marked by dense layers of guitar and ominously crackling keyboard tones, the sensation being that of standing under a pylon. This gig, according to Placebo's Brian Molko, is the biggest they have ever done in England. That's the great Placebo mystery: radio hasn't been playing their new album, Battle for the Sun, they long ago vanished from the coolness radar, yet they sell more tickets every year. The key is Molko; he imparts a human element to their industrial sub-metal sound and impressive visuals (film footage of writhing hands, monochromatic lighting, dot-matrix screens with enigmatic messages). While parents won't be happy to know the mainly young audience were lustily singing along to \"You're a slow-motion suicide\", and \"Did you forget to take your meds?\" (from Julien and Meds, respectively), it isn't hard to see why Molko makes such an effective cheerleader. The fragility suggested by his quavering voice and physical slightness, along with the glamorously seedy lyrics, would be catnip to any crowd of trainee goths. But you probably needed to be 15 to be awed by a grown man wailing: \"Damn you all to hell!\" At Manchester Central (0161-834 2700), tonight. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
