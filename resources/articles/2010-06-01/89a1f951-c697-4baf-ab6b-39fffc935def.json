Capello and his squad were due to touch down at Heathrow this morning following their 4-1 second-round defeat by Germany in Bloemfontein on Sunday, with one of the most decorated managers in the modern game effectively, and humiliatingly, in limbo. The Italian made it clear yesterday in talks with Sir Dave Richards, the chairman of Club England and his line manager, that he would not resign. An immediate show of support from his employer was not forthcoming. Instead Richards said that, while the FA acknowledged Capello's considerable success in steering England to South Africa after their failure to qualify for Euro 2008, there should now be a period of reflection in which to assess the team's performance in the finals. \"I'd prefer to stay as England manager but this is a good decision,\" said Capello when asked if he minded being made to wait until mid\u2011July to find out about his future. \"It is an intelligent answer. I respect their decision.\" The Italian is due to leave for a holiday later today, with the hiatus allowing any suitors a chance to make their interest in the 64-year-old known. The financial reality appears to be that the FA is not in a position to sack Capello, having removed a break clause in his four-year contract that would have permitted a parting ofthe ways after the tournament. Terminating the remainder of his deal would now make the FA liable for some \u00a310m in compensation, a fee it would be reluctant to meet. Whether a compromise could be reached on a pay-off is unclear. The FA sent out distinctly mixed messages yesterday, saying Capello should be recognised as \"a manager with one of the most successful records in world football and who is under contract until 2012\". That does not sit easily with its unwillingness to confirm that his future lies with England. The FA will gauge public opinion but could also use the next few weeks to scrutinise alternative candidates. Roy Hodgson and Harry Redknapp \u2013 the latter effectively declared some level of interest yesterday by saying that \"we have to find an English manager and I'm English\" \u2013 have been mentioned. \"Fabio had an outstanding record as our manager going into this tournament,\" said Adrian Bevington, the managing director of Club England. \"We hired him at a time when as a nation we were on the floor. Fabio restored confidence through a very successful qualification campaign. We're all disappointed to be leaving this tournament so early but this isn't a day to make snap decisions.\" Capello, who has won Serie A five times, said he had rejected offers to return to club management, one, reportedly, from Internazionale last month. He also said that his record as England's coach should not be judged purely on the shambolic display against Germany. \"I have received lots of offers to be the manager of clubs again, at important clubs, [but] I like this job,\" he said. \"It's not about the money. It's about the value of the man. But I will accept the FA's decision. We have worked very well for two years but the result of the last game against Germany was not good.\" While there was an unwillingness to acknowledge Germany's general dominance in Bloemfontein, and another mention of the tiredness he had seen in his players at the end of the Premier League season, Capello did admit that a considerable task will await if he continues in the role. \"I spoke with my staff and also with Sir Dave Richards about the younger players coming through. We found two or three new players: Adam Johnson, the Arsenal left-back Kieron Gibbs and Michael Dawson. Jack Wilshire at Arsenal is another interesting player. \"Also we have [Gabriel] Agbonlahor and [Bobby] Zamora, who is not young but has been injured. We spoke about this. Another player I hope will be fit is [Owen] Hargreaves. Where are the young players? The best younger ones are in the Under\u201121s and they were not ready to play here in South Africa. I hope they will be ready for qualifying for Euro 2012, in the next six months or a year. But my appetite for work won't stop. Never.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
