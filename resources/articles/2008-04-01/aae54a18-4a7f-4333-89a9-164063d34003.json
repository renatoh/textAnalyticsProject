My husband has a business that isn't doing well but he doesn't try to improve its performance. Meanwhile, I work extremely hard to support us. We've had many problems communicating about family and money - he resents my calling him lazy and irresponsible. About a year ago, he changed the way he dressed, started to work out, and began staying late at the office. I then caught him watching internet pornography. (This also happened before, a couple of years ago, and almost led to us divorcing.) Recently, I suspected that something was going on with a secretary at his workplace, but he denied it. One day, I planted a recording device in his office and, sure enough, she flirted with him and he responded with enthusiasm. I demanded he fire her the next day, which he reluctantly did. He still denied having an affair and was resentful of my criticisms of her behaviour. I showed him magazine articles on how hurtful an \"emotional\" affair can be, and he tried to justify his actions by attributing it to his need for attention. He said he is attracted to her because she is non-judgmental, and he needs somebody to talk to without worrying about being right. Should I get divorced? I want to forgive him and start our life together again, but don't know if I can forgive him knowing that he was using me and willing to hurt me for the sake of his own happiness. Your attitude is terrible You must recognise that these recent events are rooted in your lack of trust and respect for him, which seems to be chiefly a result of the fact that he is failing to support you financially and \"doesn't try to improve\" his failing business. Calling him \"lazy and irresponsible\" is counterproductive if you really want to motivate him. You should be constructive and helpful if you want things to move forward. What you should be concerned about is that your husband's colleague has been providing the respect and support that you no longer give him. You can counter this by sorting out your own insecurities. Planting a recording device in his office was ridiculous, and making your suspicions so explicit may encourage him to do just what you fear he will. Try to have a serious conversation with your husband; one where you do not apportion blame. Try to determine how each of you feels about the future. If you are both keen to rebuild the marriage, your next step would be to go for counselling as a couple. This should help you talk about the problems you have, and help him to explore how his behaviour may stem from feeling undervalued. J, via email He needs your support If your husband is struggling to be successful in his work, he needs as much support (emotional, not just financial) as you can give him. Threatening to divorce him and telling him he is lazy is quite the opposite to that. It is completely out of order for you to plant a recording device and then demand that he fire an employee because they \"flirted\" with each other - you are lucky that this woman did not sue for unfair dismissal. I have felt jealous in the past when I believed that my partner was flirting with other women, but all jealousy does is drive the person you are scared of losing away from you. Instead of sending your husband articles about how you feel, you should sit down together and talk the situation through. Remember that you have no evidence that he is having, or ever had, an affair. R, London Try to see his point of view Put yourself in your husband's shoes. There may be all sorts of reasons why he doesn't seem to be trying to improve his company's performance: depression, fear, lack of motivation or a feeling that he doesn't have your support. Have you tried to discuss his difficulties at work sensibly and without confrontation? Last year, I discovered that my husband had been having an affair. He had been depressed after being made redundant, was suffering from various medical problems, and clearly felt that our relationship was being eroded by feelings of anger and misunderstandings. While in no way condoning the affair - the pain almost destroyed me and still threatens to overwhelm me at times - I do acknowledge my part in contributing towards the state of our relationship at the time. We are working towards a better relationship. This requires us to make great changes and to acknowledge that we were both at fault. It is a much better marriage as a result. EM, via email Forgive him - for being human You need a sense of perspective here. I don't believe that your husband had a conscious desire to hurt you; his actions were the result of simple human weakness. The fact that he agreed to fire his comparatively innocent colleague also shows how far he is willing to go to salvage your relationship. You should not be asking if you should forgive your husband for using you and deliberately hurting you out of selfishness. Instead, you should ask if you should forgive him for simple human fallibility - be it sexual frustration or boredom with his work. Forgive him, then, on the grounds that it is his sense of helplessness, rather than any malice, at the root of the problems in your marriage. Try to instil a bit of excitement in your life together through some radical changes in routine. You should both explore moving somewhere else, switching career or trying other cultural and social pursuits. Making your husband feel persecuted and spied on will only increase his belief that he is the victim and undermine any respect you have left for one another. JB, via email What the expert thinks Linda Blair You have asked two questions - whether you should divorce your husband, and also whether or not you can forgive him. The second question is easily answered. Of course you can forgive him - you only need to decide to do so. The answer to your first question is, however, rather more complicated, and you need to ask yourself some further questions. Do you believe your husband is capable of changing? If you feel certain that he will never behave any differently, then it would be best for you if you leave him, because you are unhappy and disappointed in him. If you are convinced he can't change, then you will continue to feel this way. It would also be best for him, because nothing is as demoralising as living with someone who is disappointed in you and who believes there is no chance you will ever improve. You also need to ask yourself if you can think of anything you like about your husband, or if you can remember anything that once attracted you to him. If not, then again, it would be best to leave him because there is nothing for you to look forward to even if he does start to behave differently. Do you have clear ideas about what your husband can do to please you? You seem to know very well what you don't like about his behaviour, but unless you can make clear and specific suggestions about what would win your approval, he has no way of knowing what to do. Are you willing to make some changes yourself? None of your attempts so far to improve the relationship appear to have worked, so you are going to have to try some new tactics. When a relationship feels stuck and you can't see the way ahead, it is sometimes possible to break the deadlock by examining how the situation may appear from your partner's point of view. Try to imagine that things are not going at all well for you at work, and you are feeling discouraged and unsure about what to do next. In those circumstances, what could your partner do that would help you most? I think you would agree that if he were to threaten, insult and criticise you, it would only drive you away from him and encourage you to look for comfort elsewhere. Wouldn't you feel better about yourself, and wouldn't you be more willing to try really hard to improve your business, if he makes it clear that he believes in you, and that he is willing to listen to you and offer encouragement as you try to come up with ways to get yourself back on track? What I hope you can see is that your present approach is pushing your husband away. It may well be that this is the only tactic you are familiar with to \"motivate\" others. Did you grow up in an unsupportive environment? If you did, you don't need to repeat an unhappy past. You could learn to listen carefully, to show warmth and support, and to offer clear and constructive suggestions rather than criticisms. Building on the positive is the best way forward, and the one most likely to help you stay together and be happy. Next week My partner can't cope with my illness For many years now, I have suffered from bulimia and depression. I have been hospitalised once and have had to seek treatment several times for the side-effects of bulimia. The effects on my body, self-esteem and personal life have become too much for me. This is hard on the people who care for me, particularly my partner. We are both in our mid-20s and have been together for nearly two years. Last year, he proposed and I said yes. We planned to marry this year. A few months ago, after weeks of arguing, my partner said he wanted to call off the wedding. He said he still loves me, but that he wasn't sure if he wanted to be with me for the rest of our lives, because of my illness. We have been happier recently as I have been getting a bit better, but he still doesn't want to get married. It must be hard being a carer but why won't he commit to me? I am doing everything I can to get better, and I have even suggested he goes to a carers' support group. He says it is a good idea but nothing happens. He is extremely passive-aggressive and I wonder if this is a way of getting at me for being a burden. I feel I am being blamed for having a disease that I can't help and that I am fighting as much as possible. Anxiety over this often makes my symptoms worse. Should I confront him or give him an ultimatum? Or should I put up and shut up? \u00b7 Private Lives appears every Thursday. You are invited to respond to this week's main problem.
