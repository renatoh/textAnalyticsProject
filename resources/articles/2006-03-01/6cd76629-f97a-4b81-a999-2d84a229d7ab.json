Around 100 students occupied the campus library for nearly six hours until 2am to highlight their disquiet at what they see as \"financial mismanagement\" at the Brighton university. The students claim teaching hours in arts and humanities degrees have been cut and there have been cuts in interdisciplinary courses. They are demanding a minimum of eight hours contact time per week for all students and no course cuts. Student spokesman Alasdair Russell, 21, who completes his international relations degree this year, said: \" In my first year I was getting up to 16 hours contact time a week, now I have four hours - there are Open University students who get more than me. \"If you consider the amount of money we are spending per hour on our education it is huge.\" The students were also protesting against tuition top-up fees, what they see as the privatisation of student accommodation and lack of food provision on campus. Further action is being planned. Mr Russell admitted they felt \"emboldened\" by the industrial action over pay earlier this week by university lecturers. He said: \" We are in full solidarity with the lecturers - it's a semi-related issue.\" The student action comes 15 months after staff at the university held a vote of no confidence in the university's vice-chancellor, Alasdair Smith, after Sussex predicted it would have a \u00a34m deficit in 2004. But in a statement today, the university said it was now predicting a \u00a32m deficit this year and that \"in common with other higher education institutes the funding position for universities is extremely tight\". It confirmed that it \"took action last year to address a significant financial deficit, which improved our financial position by \u00a33m\". This was met through voluntary staff redundancies and \"streamlining administrative processes\". There was no reduction in academic posts, a university spokeswoman said. The university also denied that student contact hours or courses had been cut to help offset the deficit. Twice-termly meetings have been established with representatives from the students' union to discuss a \"range of issues\" with the first due to take place on March 17."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
