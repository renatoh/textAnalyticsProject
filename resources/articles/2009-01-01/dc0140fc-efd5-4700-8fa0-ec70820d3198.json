The home team won the match, the visitors earned themselves a bonus point for losing by only six points. The fortunes of the Welsh region now depend on tomorrow's results. As runners-up in their pool, they face competition from Wasps and either Leinster or Toulouse. The sweat begins. The silver lining for the Ospreys is that progress as the eighth best team would give them an away quarter-final against Cardiff. They might settle for that. Silver linings were thin around this game. It was a hard old slog. Having traded nothing but respect from afar during the week, it was bound to be a little less polite when these two teams came face to face. Afterwards, the Ospreys coaches, Sean Holley and Jonathan Humphreys, claimed that there were \"A couple of players with marks around their eyes\" and that: \"There were a couple of incidents with Julian [White] they were particularly upset with.\" They made contact with the citing officer immediately after the game. From the opening moments, there was grappling and wrestling and holding and blocking. Julian White and Ryan Jones rolled around in the first minute and the home captain would later have to prise Marco Wentzel off him. It was not just the big forwards who crossed the legal divide. Toby Flood loitered so far offside just before the half-hour that referee Christophe Berdos seemed at first to see the funny side of it. He then heard the less amused reaction of the crowd and reached for a yellow card. While Flood was off for 10 minutes, the Ospreys surged forward. Gavin Henson was put clear, having initiated the counter-attack, but seemed to lack the confidence to go for the line. Solid at full-back, Henson lacked the incision that would have been provided by Lee Byrne, who had failed a morning fitness test on the ankle he injured in Perpignan. Geordan Murphy committed the last little bit of nonsense of the first half, obstructing Shane Williams after the Ospreys had won a scrum against the head and launched their most dangerous attacker down the blind side. Williams was blocked, James Hook went for the corner, the Ospreys won a free-kick and Ryan Jones tried to throw a long pass to Andrew Bishop in the centre. Flood returned with the scoreboard showing the same numbers \u2013 6-3 \u2013 as it had when he left. Those points came from penalties. The dart by Williams was a rare break-out from the contact area. This was one for the impurists. The visitors might have attempted a little more with the ball if they had managed to control it at the tackle. But for a side who generally give no presents away, they handed over a lot of possession. For their part, the Ospreys might have been more irresistible had they managed to win more of their own throw-ins at the line-out. It was a struggle at that set piece and for all that they could not control the ball, Leicester made life very difficult for the home team at the breakdown. It was the desire for quickly recycled ball meeting an age-old wiliness from the masters of delay. It was a further contribution to the stifling of a classic. Shortly after the interval, Hook increased the lead to six points after another offence at the ruck. Such a margin did not trigger release, especially when it was cut back to three with another penalty by Derick Hougaard. When Williams again set off in pursuit of his own kick ahead on the edge of the last quarter, he mysteriously failed to arrive at the other end. Nothing was spotted. More pairs of eyes were required. What the chase did provide was a decent position. The Ospreys repackaged Williams as a midfield drifter and eventually the referee's arm went out to indicate a penalty, landed by Hook. It led almost immediately to the same action by the referee, this time his arm held out in favour of Leicester for a scrum offence. Hougaard landed the kick. Huw Bennett came on to replace Richard Hibbard, but before he could demonstrate the superior throwing skills, the accuracy that has given him the nod over his team-mate in the Six Nations squad, he lost one against the head at his scrum. The slightest goosebump of an advantage was flattened. Another flicker of a chance came when Jonny Vaughton ran back a kick and Leicester were penalised at the ruck. The kings of delay were getting a little clumsy. Up to six points the lead again crept, not enough for the home team, the losing bonus point all-important for Leicester. Alun Wyn Jones hit a ruck at the wrong angle and the last chance had gone. Leicester grabbed the ball and no one else came near it for the last two minutes. It was a grim old end to a grim old game. Two teams with all that respect for each other never found the key to freedom. Not that Leicester looked too hard. They came to do their professional number, the garnering of a single point. No one can suck the life out offrom a game as well as the Tigers. On they march, former winners into the last eight. The y are not the force they were, but that is because more teams have risen to the standards they once set. In doing so, rugby as a spectacle has suffered a bit. But sometimes an ugly old success is just the ticket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
