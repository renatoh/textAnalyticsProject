Ryan, the MP for Enfield North, said she had been a member for four decades but could no longer remain as a Labour MP. Echoing Luciana Berger, the Jewish MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Ryan blamed what she claimed was the Labour leadership\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d in the face of the \u201cevil\u201d of antisemitism, for her decision to resign. In a stinging resignation letter, she said: \u201cI cannot remain a member of the Labour party while this requires me to suggest that I believe Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 a man who has presided over the culture of anti-Jewish racism and hatred of Israel that now afflicts my former party \u2013 is fit to be prime minister of this country. He is not.\u201d Ryan, who lost a non-binding no confidence vote by her constituency Labour party in September, will join the seven MPs who stepped down on Monday, and sit as an independent in the House of Commons. Her departure will stoke fears that Labour could be hit by rolling resignations in the days and weeks ahead. Ryan told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she had left because: \u201cI can no longer ask people to vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister of this country because I don\u2019t believe he is fit to be the prime minister of this country.\u201d She said there was no need for her to resign as an MP to force a byelection because she had explicitly fought the 2017 election saying she did not support Corbyn, claiming she had won her seat in spite of him and \u201cnot on his coat-tails\u201d. Ryan also claimed there were \u201cmany very, very unhappy\u201d MPs in Labour who could come to a similar decision and join the Independent Group of MPs. The news of Ryan\u2019s resignation emerged as Westminster was abuzz with rumours that a string of centrist Tories could be poised to join the Independent Group, which was formed on Monday by seven former Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. The ardent anti-Brexit campaigners Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, as well as Heidi Allen, who has been on an anti-poverty tour around Britain with the ex-Labour MP Frank Field, were deemed the most likely recruits, but did not respond to requests for comment. Another vehement critic of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit policy, Sam Gyimah, the former Tory minister who resigned over the government\u2019s position on Brexit, ruled out joining the Independent Group. \u201cI hugely admire Luciana Berger\u2019s brave stance against antisemitism. But, ultimately, this is a Labour party matter and is nothing to do with me,\u201d he said. Corbyn had earlier sought to play down the significance of the seven Labour resignations, telling the group that they they won their seats in 2017 on Labour\u2019s leftwing manifesto. \u201cThey were elected to carry out those policies. They decided to go somewhere else,\u201d he told a manufacturing conference in Westminster. Labour is keen to ramp up the pressure on the breakaway MPs to trigger byelections in their seats, and run against official Labour candidates. In a signal of the leadership\u2019s hardening attitude to the breakaway MPs, Corbyn\u2019s close ally Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the cabinet office, announced that Labour would consult on changing the law to allow constituents to remove an MP who resigns from their party. \u201cCommunities should not have to wait for up to five years to act if they feel their MP is not properly representing their interests,\u201d Trickett said. \u201cThis proposed reform has the dramatic potential to empower citizens and will be one of many measures the Labour party is planning to consult on and announce that will change the way politics in this country is done.\u201d Current law allows voters to petition for the recall of their MP, but only in specific circumstances \u2013 such as where they\u2019ve committed a criminal offence, as in the case of the Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya. The former prime minister Sir John Major underscored the mood of political turmoil last night, when he became the latest senior Tory to warn that his party had been captured by pro-Brexit rightwingers. \u201cAt the moment, there are people who \u2013 for now \u2013 may have their boots within the Conservative or Labour parties, but not their minds, nor their hearts,\u201d the former Tory prime minister told an audience at the University of Glasgow on Tuesday, warning that both parties were being, \u201cmanipulated by fringe opinion\u201d. He suggested traditional mainstream Conservatives were being \u201chollowed out\u201d by rightwing ex-Ukip members seeking to influence the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Corbyn\u2019s unrepentant stance appeared unlikely to reassure a fresh wave of Labour MPs wondering whether to quit their party. Ian Austin, MP for Dudley South, told his local paper, the Express and Star: \u201cPeople, me included, are going to be thinking long and hard about the position we\u2019re in now.\u201d He said that extremism, antisemitism and intolerance had \u201cdriven good MPs and decent people who\u2019ve committed their lives to mainstream politics out of the Labour party\u201d and said he would make a decision about his own future by the end of the week. When the Labour leader was asked on Tuesday whether he agreed with his deputy, Tom Watson, who said on Monday the frontbench of his party needed to \u201cbroaden out\u201d to reflect the balance of views in the parliamentary Labour party, he said: \u201cI recognise that leading the party means you have to take people with you, and I\u2019m determined to do that.\u201d But he said Labour policy was already developed in consultation with backbenchers, adding: \u201cAnyone who does not feel consulted is not taking up, in my view, the opportunities that are available, at all times, to do that.\u201d There was no hint that Corbyn was prepared to carry out the reshuffle Watson appeared to be demanding. Corbyn\u2019s tone was in marked contrast to that of John McDonnell, who promised a \u201cmammoth, massive listening exercise\u201d. The shadow chancellor told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIf there are issues that we have to address, we\u2019ll address them. If it is about the style of the leadership, we\u2019ll address that. If it is about policy, we will listen to that as well.\u201d Major praised the courage of the breakaway Labour MPs; but said both main parties needed to remain \u201cmainstream\u201d. He said Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) had become a party within a party, \u201cwith its own whips, its own funding and its own priorities\u201d. He said: \u201cSome of its more extreme members have little or no affinity to moderate, pragmatic and tolerant Conservatism.\u201d Major has made a series of forthright interventions in the Brexit debate in recent months \u2013 but his remarks underlined the sense that with little more than six weeks to go until Britain is due to leave the EU, the ongoing wrangle about the shape of the Brexit deal is shaking up both political parties. Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, echoed Major\u2019s concerns about the influence of the ERG on the government\u2019s direction, telling Sky News: \u201cThere are many of us who normally would not be commenting in public about a wing of our party or, indeed, individuals themselves. \u201cWe are doing so because they are coming to the point of tarnishing the actual brand of the party and I want to remain inside a modern, compassionate, inclusive, outward-looking party that\u2019s attractive to the next generation.\u201d He said a series of senior Conservatives had decided to come forward to say \u201cno, not in our name,\u201d adding that he didn\u2019t want the approach of the ERG to \u201cpoison the moderate perspective of the centre-right Conservative party\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
