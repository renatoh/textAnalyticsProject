The Nigerian asylum seeker has not eaten in 90 days and is now said to weigh just 50kg. He says he expects to be targeted by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram, which has already reportedly killed several members of his family. It is also said he cannot see or stand. But that aside, he's got to go. Muazu was due to be deported to Nigeria on Wednesday evening, but arrangements with Virgin Atlantic went awry so Friday's the day. But how? Campaigners say the chosen solution is to fly him out by private jet and, despite pleas from us, the Home Office seems reluctant to deny that. Campaigners even have the flight number relating to an upmarket charter outfit in Scotland. They wouldn't talk to us either. Some way to go. Seems a shame that Muazu won't know much about it. \u2022 Of course, this area is fraught with problems. The Home Office 2012-2013 annual report reveals the government lost \u00a32.5m during that financial year on scheduled charter flights cancelled because asylum seekers were found to have a right of appeal before they could be put on the plane. A select few get the private private jet. The UK Border Agency fesses up via freedom of information requests to six flights removing fewer than five people on 30 August 2007, 13 February 2008, 31 March 2008, 27 March 2009, 27 October 2010 and 16 February 2011. Their destinations were as far-flung as the Congo, Pakistan, Egypt and Georgia. Cost \u00a3350,000; some paid by us, some by other EU states. And then of course this year, there was Abu Qatada, ousted belatedly, reluctantly, but in some opulence. It's the only way to go. \u2022 It's not a cheap operation. But then the whole business of deportation by charter flight costs a pretty penny. During the financial year April 2012 to March 2013, there were 49 charter flights carrying deportees to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana, Italy, Sri Lanka, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Austria, the Gambia, Egypt, Portugal, Kosovo and Albania. Of those deported, 2,099 were male and 192 female. Whole thing cost about \u00a313m. Even MigrationWatch can't say the coalition isn't trying to please. \u2022 He was the enfant terrible of British advertising, Trevor Beattie, the man who brought the Wonderbra \"Hello Boys\" phenomenon and the FCUK (French Connection UK) misspelling into popular culture. Now he wants to be taken more seriously. \"There's more to me than mispelled swear words and cleavage,\" he told a CityTalks event at Birmingham City University. Seriously as a Brummie, for starters. He has a weekend retreat slap bang in the centre of Birmingham, \"a city built on a river of Balti\", and says he just loves the people. \"Brummies should continue to put themselves down; it's the antidote to Scousers,\" pronounces the adman. Seriously as a pioneer. Beattie plans to be one of the first passengers on Richard Branson's space rocket Virgin Galactic next year, part of the annexation of solar space by Birmingham. \"We all have to leave Birmingham to take intelligent life out there,\" he says. \u2022 For those who believe Downton Abbey couldn't possibly get worse, enter Mike Tyson, once the pulverisers' pulveriser, now a would-be thespian. \"I'm coming to the West End soon for my one-man show, so maybe when I fly to the UK, they'll give me a part on Downton Abbey,\" he tells ShortList magazine. Will he tune in for the Christmas special? \"You never know,\" says Tyson. \"I watch Benny Hill \u2013 and if you watch Benny Hill, you'll watch anything.\" With Downton for light relief. \u2022 Finally, an end to the impasse at Margaret Thatcher House in north London, where the forecourt was squatted by Occupy, protesting at Finchley MP Mike Freer's role in the new anti-squatting legislation. Despite the civil exchanges between the occupiers and Freer, the local Conservative association deployed bailiffs to clear the encampment, occasioning cries of foul and disputed accusations of bad faith. They will meet again. Just the end of the beginning, one thinks. diary@theguardian.com Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
