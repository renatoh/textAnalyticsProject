On Sunday, Manchester United got their calculations marginally wrong as Sir Alex Ferguson tried to win an FA Cup semi-final while making the smallest possible demands of his squad. In consequence his club, after the penalty shoot-out with Everton, lost its chance of winning all five tournaments in which it has taken part this season. That, in itself, cannnot reduce the manager to despair. If Ferguson is at all uneasy it will be because disappointment in one competition can contaminate prospects in another. Sunday's tie intrigued mostly for the spectacle of a manager trying to establish the minimum level of quality he would need to eke out victory. Gifted footballers came off the bench one by one, as if a pipette was being employed to introduced talent a drop at a time. Certain players, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, were spared Wembley entirely and others, including Wayne Rooney, had knocks from which they might recover before the encounter with Portsmouth at Old Trafford tomorrow. Inevitably, such a policy conveys the impression that United are beginning to feel the strain. It is quite an accolade to the team standing 14th in the table that Ferguson felt that a gap of over 72 hours between the end of the semi-final and kick-off in the Premier League game would not suffice for some of the members of his squad. Defeat by Everton will still have its after-effects. That could be sensed in the debate among disgruntled fans about the consequences of paying \u00a330.75m to Tottenham for Dimitar Berbatov, a forward with a marvellous touch who does not set up all that many goals and has scored just twice on his own account since 27 January. There is nothing to prevent him from turning into a marvel for United eventually and even his trickler of a penalty at Wembley would have been cheered for its nervelessness had the trailing foot of Tim Howard not been in its path. In the short term, however, there is simply disquiet about the Bulgarian. The general air of concern ought to be nothing more than a brief quirk of the mind. Clean sheets should be a regular feature now that Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand are in harness together again. The more delicate and, perhaps, impossible task is to renew the authority that was conveyed so effortlessly for months. In taking an FA Cup semi-final lightly, Ferguson has added to the status of the Portsmouth match and the apprehensions attached to it, especially as the visitors have been defeated only once in their last eight league games. Reassurance for United comes in the realisation that stress is not exclusive to them in the upper reaches of the table. Liverpool have not been spared the sort of examination they are now about to face once again. They have not been champions of England since 1990 and last finished as runners-up seven years ago. The burden of those disappointments can buckle the knees of contemporary players who had no part in most of the anti-climaxes. Liverpool have already been hurt by premature acclaim. On 28 December they won 5-1 at St James' Park and were showered with superlatives. \"I think we have just seen the title winners,\" enthused the then Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear. It ought to have been borne in mind that he had good cause to divert attention from his own squad. Liverpool then took mere draws in the three league fixtures that followed, against Stoke, Everton and Wigan. Now their reputation is beginning to glow again. They were deemed worth the decidedly silly accusation last week by Ferguson and the Ewood Park manager Sam Allardyce that Ben\u00edtez had made a dismissive gesture when Liverpool went 2-0 up against Blackburn in a 4-0 win. Whatever else is said of the Spaniard, he is a technocrat and tactician rather than a lout. The Anfield account rang true that he had been reacting wryly to a goal concocted by players ignoring his instructions. This petty affair was actually confirmation that Liverpool had been recognised at Old Trafford as a genuine threat, but Ben\u00edtez's team will have to last the pace as they could not do in the early part of 2009. Victory at home to Arsenal tonight would put them a couple of points ahead of United, who will have two games in hand. Liverpool have been carefree while lacking Steven Gerrard, who is still injured, but the challenge now is to maintain those high spirits when the prize really is at stake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
