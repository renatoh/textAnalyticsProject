Flanagan has not played a competitive game since May 2014 having been plagued by a knee problem that stalled his hugely promising Anfield career. The 22-year-old full-back played an integral role in Liverpool\u2019s title challenge under Brendan Rodgers in 2013-14, culminating in a place on Roy Hodgson\u2019s stand-by list for England\u2019s World Cup squad that summer. But an injury suffered in pre-season training in 2014 resulted in three operations and 19 months on the sidelines for a defender Rodgers saw as key to his system at Liverpool. Flanagan will make his long-awaited return in a friendly for Liverpool\u2019s Under-21s against their Fleetwood counterparts. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, meanwhile, has called for more goals from Liverpool\u2019s creative trio of Philippe Coutinho, Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino with Divock Origi joining his fellow strikers Daniel Sturridge and Danny Ings on the injury list. Coutinho has scored five Premier League goals this season but the \u00a329m summer signing Firmino has only one and Lallana none in the league, although he has two in the Europa League, before Wednesday\u2019s trip to Sunderland. The Liverpool manager admits the team requires more goals from the trip, given the injury problems in attack. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough goals, you always have to talk and think about how you can bring the others in position to score goals,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cWe have such quality that we have to use this. We have our moments when we are shooting and we have a little bit of bad luck. For example, Adam has had some situations where he could have had goals but we are working on this. It is always about more in these situations. You cannot wait for just one chance and then you will make it. It is not like this. We have to always be in position. We try to improve. We know about this. It is the truth. To be more dangerous from all positions is a big target for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
