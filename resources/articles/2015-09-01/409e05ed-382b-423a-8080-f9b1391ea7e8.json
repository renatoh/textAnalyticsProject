The advent of a powerful technique for editing the genome \u2013 called CRISPR-Cas9 \u2013 is certain to go down as one of those defining moments. Even though the technique was developed only three years ago, progress has been rapid. This has led to much excitement, in the scientific community and beyond, about its potential to transform the research landscape, our understanding of disease and even how we treat it. But there have also been concerns about the future applications of this technology \u2013 even before the revelation this year that Chinese researchers had used the technique for the first time to edit the DNA of non-viable human embryos. To many researchers, the Chinese experiments were interesting, but ethically unexceptional: much laboratory research is routinely conducted on early human embryos already, genetic engineering is not new and the embryos were incapable of developing to term. To many others, however, the research crossed an ethical red line. While the embryos used were not viable, the altered DNA could, if edited in a viable embryo, be passed on to future generations. The researchers had thus edited the human germline \u2013 inherited material that comes from the eggs or sperm and is passed on to offspring \u2013 a threshold which many believe should never be crossed. Some scientists argued for a moratorium on germline editing of any human embryos, even if not viable. I understand why concern about germline genome editing runs so deep, and why some in medical research and ethics are tempted by a moratorium. They are right that editing the nuclear DNA of an embryo, with a view to creating a born person, would be a hugely significant step for humanity. They are also right that the risks involved in using CRISPR-Cas9 this way \u2013 especially those of introducing unwanted genetic changes alongside desired ones \u2013 are such that it would be unconscionable to use the technique for reproductive purposes for the immediately foreseeable future. And they are correct that techniques honed on non-viable embryos could easily be applied to viable ones. CRISPR-Cas9 differs from other methods of gene editing, in part because it is simple, fast and cheap, so it is sensible to worry about potential misuse. But while I support the legal prohibitions on genome editing \u2013 which in the UK permit licensed experiments on embryos up to 14 days, but not implantation in a woman \u2013 I am not persuaded by the case for a wider ban or moratorium. We must have a full and open-ended debate about the circumstances in which we might one day wish to allow (or prohibit) genome editing in human reproduction. But we should also allow well-regulated laboratory research, with strong ethical oversight, to proceed. CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful technology which has been applied with success to the genomes of yeast, plants, mice, rats, pigs and primates. As awareness of the technique has grown, so, too, have the discussions about its potential human applications. The most immediate and encouraging is as a research tool, giving us a much better understanding of the way genes function in the body. There has also already been some exciting progress in applying the technology in the clinic, as a way of making gene therapy a reality. Promising cancer treatments in development involve removing immune cells from patients and rewriting their DNA, so that the cells seek out and destroy tumours when returned to the body. But there are more controversial applications on the horizon. With the ability to edit the genome precisely comes the possibility of this technique being one day used in human embryos, to prevent inherited diseases. Any change made here \u2013 the \u201cgermline\u201d \u2013 would be permanent, and passed on to future generations. For good reason, this type of clinical application is illegal in the UK and many other jurisdictions. We are right to be cautious. However, it must be stressed that our scientific knowledge of CRISPR-Cas9 is nowhere near advanced enough to even consider its use as a therapeutic tool in human embryos (a fact that the Chinese researchers who edited the DNA of embryos took great care to point out). This doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t be talking about the possibility. With genome editing, as with any new scientific technique, it\u2019s vital that discussions about the potential applications start early, and are not limited to the narrow community of scientific researchers who are currently using them. Happily, a public debate is already under way, with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics project on genome editing and the Progress Educational Trust\u2019s forthcoming public conference. This debate, however, should not be accompanied by any sort of wider moratorium on editing the germline of human embryos, so long as any such work is done in the context of well-regulated research. A moratorium is not necessary to stop germline editing of human beings in well-regulated jurisdictions, as such editing is already illegal in these places. A moratorium would not be effective at stopping germline editing where there is no such regulation and it would be extremely damaging to our ability to investigate the full potential of this powerful but young and incompletely understood technology. A moratorium, I believe, would frame the debate that we need with unhelpful assumptions. In the UK, as in many other countries, successive parliaments have established the principle that early human embryos do not have the same legal or ethical status as born people, and that certain experiments are permissible so long as development does not exceed a certain point (usually 14 days). A moratorium on germline gene editing would overturn this, without good justification. It would suggest a starting point that the technology is uniquely troublesome, making it harder for ethical debate to remain genuinely open-ended. What is more, even a temporary ban would require society to begin debating gene editing, while eschewing the pursuit of knowledge that could directly inform that debate. It would prevent scientists from making discoveries that could allow us all to make better decisions about whether any risks to health are worth the potential benefits. A better model to follow is the parallel scientific, ethical and public consideration of mitochondrial donation \u2013 which led ultimately to parliament\u2019s decision this year to allow families affected by devastating diseases to use this technique to try to have unaffected children. Three public consultations were accompanied by detailed ethical, legal and scientific reviews, that built an overwhelming consensus behind a change in the law. Only then, after seven years of debate and discussion, in which no scientific difference or ethical criticism went unexplored, did MPs and peers vote to approve the technique \u2013 subject still to licensing by the fertility regulator. Critically, laboratory research into mitochondrial donation \u2013 using embryos that would never develop beyond 14 days or be implanted in a womb \u2013 was allowed to proceed in parallel with this debate. This provided the evidence showing that the time was right to proceed, and made sure that no time would be lost in treating patients now that society has decided this should happen. We think a debate about any new scientific advance is informed and enriched by continued research to understand and refine these techniques in a laboratory, under strict regulatory limits and scientific scrutiny. Many of the questions that the public and policymakers will rightly raise can be answered only if researchers are actively investigating the techniques, testing a variety of hypotheses and advancing their own knowledge. A moratorium on research would be a moratorium on this understanding. The Progress Educational Trust is a charity that works to improve the choices for people affected by infertility and genetic conditions and promotes the responsible application of science. A public conference, From Three-Person IVF to Genome Editing: The Science and Ethics of Engineering the Embryo, will take place in London on 9 December. HOW THE SCIENCE WORKS DNA provides the blueprint which makes us who we are. It codes our genome, the 20,000 or so genes which produce proteins, which in different combinations allow cells to carry out their functions \u2014 a heart cell has different genes turned on than a brain cell, so they act differently. Scientists have for years been able to change the way these genes are turned off and on and thereby change the properties of cells, which is useful in finding out what individual genes do. Genome editing techniques use \u201cmolecular scissors\u201d to cut DNA to remove a gene and provide a template to introduce a new gene when the repair mechanisms of the cell try to correct the cut. This can be done in cells, but also in lab animals such as mice, allowing scientists to study the difference between the new and the old. Often, this is used to better understand the genetics of diseases such as cancer, with the aim of prevention and treatment. Previous techniques cost more and took longer than the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has soared in popularity since 2012, and its ease of use means it is possible it will be applied to humans in the near future. This includes transfusions of HIV-resistant immune cells into infected patients, or even modifying embryos so that a family\u2019s genetic diseases are not inherited. It could also stretch to parents intervening to make sure they have children with blue, rather than brown, eyes, or even certain athletic abilities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
