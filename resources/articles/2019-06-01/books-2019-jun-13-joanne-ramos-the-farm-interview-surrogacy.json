Alabama\u2019s near-total ban on abortion has left her fearing the worst: \u201cI still can\u2019t fully believe it, to tell you the truth. The extremity of it is shocking. It\u2019s everything \u2013 it\u2019s rape or incest. I can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re here again.\u201d When the impossible keeps happening, it can feel disorienting and overwhelming: \u201cIt\u2019s like, what is up and what is down? \u2026 It\u2019s like you\u2019re living in a world that\u2019s been turned.\u201d The world is similarly off kilter in Ramos\u2019s debut novel, The Farm, which imagines a luxury service that provides rich clients with surrogate mothers, confining the surrogates to a five-star country retreat during pregnancy. \u201cI thought of it as where we are today, but pushed forward just a few inches,\u201d she says \u2013 just enough to make people feel a little uneasy, but close enough that readers would need to ask themselves how much of it is real. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to feel like sci-fi, so people would say, \u2018Oh, that would never happen.\u2019 In fact, the one thing I hope people don\u2019t say afterwards is, \u2018That could never happen.\u2019 I hope people are like, \u2018Woah! Is this happening? Is it real?\u2019 Because it\u2019s where we are.\u201d A novel that examines immigration, inequality and the control women have over their own bodies feels all too urgent, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement of how extreme things have gotten that this book should feel timely.\u201d The Farm circles around questions of money, race and power with the story of a young Filipina, Jane, who signs up to become a surrogate mother. The fee for carrying the baby safely to term would be enough to change her life, taking her out of the dormitory in Queens where she lives with her six-month-old daughter and setting them up in their own apartment. But no children are allowed at Golden Oaks, so during her nine-month stay, Jane must leave her daughter in the care of an older friend, Evelyn. Cocooned in an unfamiliar existence of quinoa salads, exercise classes and constant surveillance, Jane becomes steadily more uneasy about the child she has left behind, and more suspicious of the regime under which she is living. As her pregnancy progresses, an awkward friendship develops between Jane and her roommate Reagan, who is a \u201cPremium Host\u201d \u2013 a rarity among the predominantly African American and Filipina surrogates because she is pretty, white and a summa cum laude graduate. On the other side is Mae, a Chinese-American Harvard Business School graduate who runs Golden Oaks, making sure the wealthy clients are happy by keeping the hosts on the tightest of leashes. As a true believer in the value of free trade, Mae is convinced that the contract between her rich clients and the poor surrogates is good for both sides. But can the underprivileged women under her care ever make a choice that is truly free? Ramos took no notice of the usual advice for first-time authors to write what they know, opting to follow a Meg Wolitzer suggestion: \u201cWrite what obsesses you.\u201d But the parallels between her characters and her own life are uncanny \u2013 like Jane and Evelyn, Ramos was born in the Philippines, and like Mae, she studied at an Ivy League college. While she may embody the success her characters are chasing, the author is much more ambivalent about the American dream. Born in 1973 in Manila, Ramos moved to Wisconsin when she was six years old. Her father, a cleaning supplies salesman, got a transfer to Racine. Every weekend after church they\u2019d visit her dad\u2019s family, who lived at the heart of Milwaukee\u2019s small Filipino community. \u201cThat was very much where I got a sense of what it means to be part of a big, clamorous Filipino family because we were always together,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was warm, loud, with a lot of questions, some of them nosey, and a lot of love.\u201d A promising student, Ramos was encouraged to apply for some of the US\u2019s most prestigious colleges. It was only when she began studying political science at Princeton that Ramos began her education in wealth and privilege. \u201cThe rich kids in our town were the doctors\u2019 kids \u2013 they got cars on their 16th birthday, that\u2019s what I knew. But at Princeton I met people who had never had summer jobs and it was a given that they didn\u2019t need to work.\u201d At one of the first parties she went to, another student asked what her father did. \u201cI thought I\u2019d heard them wrong because no one had ever asked me that before. Because they don\u2019t know my dad, so why would they give a shit what my dad did, right?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, he sells floor wax.\u2019 And I say this jokingly, but it did make me feel very intimidated and pretty small.\u201d After graduating with a ton of debt, Ramos put her dreams of becoming a writer aside and went to work for Morgan Stanley, then a private equity firm. But she despaired of the well-worn track to Harvard Business School and pivoted towards journalism, eventually landing a job with the Economist. \u201cFor a while I did think maybe that was it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was writing. Unfortunately it was writing about finance and economics.\u201d After a difficult third pregnancy, Ramos became a stay-at-home parent. Instead of the office, Ramos spent her days at the park with her children or taking them on play dates. As she got to know the people looking after the other children she realised that many of them were nannies, and many of them were Filipinas. As a child in Wisconsin, she spent every Sunday surrounded by her Filipino relatives, but as a mother in New York, \u201cthe only Filipinas I knew were domestic workers\u201d. Ramos started writing short stories about the inequalities she saw around her, the gaps between the friends she made at Princeton and the friends she was making by the swings and slides. She dismisses these stories now with a wave of her hand as \u201cbad, bad, bad\u201d, but one day at breakfast she picked up her husband\u2019s copy of the Wall Street Journal and saw an advert for a surrogacy service in India. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of them before,\u201d she remembers, \u201cand I didn\u2019t do any more research. I didn\u2019t even think it was a story idea, it\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d The idea of a place where women go to carry other people\u2019s babies is extreme, Ramos continues, \u201cbut it\u2019s only an extension of what\u2019s already happening. Women take care of other people\u2019s kids all the time, leaving their own kids behind, sacrificing family for family.\u201d Gradually a novel started taking shape with chapters that switched between Jane, Evelyn, Reagan and Mae. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how else to do it,\u201d Ramos explains, \u201cbecause otherwise it was one person\u2019s perspective and one view. I wanted to question the society we\u2019ve collectively chosen, so I wanted to have people who believe in it, too.\u201d At the heart of surrogacy lie questions about choice and power, but Ramos says she has nothing against it. \u201cI guess I would question how far we\u2019ve pushed so many things into the realm of markets. I just wonder what that does to our relationships.\u201d When value is conflated with price, as happens so often in our society, things get warped, she says: \u201cCertain things which are unpaid, like motherhood, are not even seen until they\u2019re outsourced. Does surrogacy make people value pregnancy more \u2026 or does it diminish it because it\u2019s just another thing to buy?\u201d Ramos may not have the answers for our disoriented world, but since Trump\u2019s election she has become more active in politics, teaming up with friends to support a local state legislator. \u201cThere are so many things that seem dire right now, so I just try to pick a battle or two where maybe me and my friends can make some difference.\u201d She\u2019s not yet sure how she\u2019ll respond to events in Alabama, but staying on the sidelines is not an option. \u201cI think people will remember this time, either way it goes. And what they should be asking of us is: \u2018What did you do?\u2019 And I would like to be able to hold up my head and say that at least I tried.\u201d \u2022 The Farm by Joanne Ramos is published by Bloomsbury.
