The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino (@lgamgam) is at the Hillary Clinton event in Las Vegas and our home page will host her full coverage. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The race for the White House accepted a new contender Tuesday in Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor. In a launch event in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Huckabee staked out ground on the right that could make him competitive in Iowa and other states with large blocs of evangelical voters. Huckabee railed against abortion, said hell would freeze over before Iran got a nuclear weapons and said that if he were president, \u201cwe would deal with jihadis just as we would with deadly snakes.\u201d Huckabee also favors a flat consumption tax to replace most all other taxes and would abolish the IRS. Huckabee may have violated campaign finance laws, but that\u2019s OK, because they don\u2019t expect to enforce those this time around anyway. In non-Huckabee news, Republican hopeful Carly Fiorina, who announced her candidacy yesterday, said she would roll back net neutrality. \u201c\u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing that the FCC just issued 400 pages of new regulation over the internet,\u201d Fiorina said at a TechCrunch Disrupt event. New Jersey governor Chris Christie was asked about continuing legal action in the Bridgegate case. \u201cListen, if they want to subpoena me, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said \u2013 one of those phrases you don\u2019t want to hear yourself mouthing if you\u2019re thinking of running for president. Or anything else. Hillary Clinton was to speak about immigration policy at a roundtable event at Rancho High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. Jeb Bush sent viewers his best wishes on the occasion of Cinco de Mayo. Is your Spanish as good as his? What a welcome! Here\u2019s more on the Christie \u201csubpoena me\u201d remarks, via AP: \u201cListen, if they want to subpoena me, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Christie said with Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant outside a restaurant in Flowood. \u201cI\u2019ve fully cooperated with the investigation right from the beginning, and I\u2019m happy to tell anybody everything I know, which I\u2019ve done with three separate investigations now that have come to the same conclusion that I said the day after this happened. And so, you know, I don\u2019t have any misgivings about that at all.\u201d Asked about the indictments, Christie said: \u201cIt\u2019s always sad to see people who have been charged with a crime. Now, we\u2019ll let the justice system take its course.\u201d Be careful what you wish for... asked in Mississippi Tuesday about the double indictment and guilty plea last Friday in the George Washington Bridge lane closures, New Jersey governor Chris Christie was quoted thusly: \u201cIf they want to subpoena me, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Christie said at an event in Flowood, Mississippi, as quoted by NJ.com. Is Chelsea Clinton actually going to talk to the media this time? Here she is deflecting criticism that the Clinton Foundation knowingly inappropriately accepted money from foreign donors who wanted something out of the state department while Hillary Clinton was secretary: The Mike Huckabee campaign has just sent out a fundraising letter that does not repeat his launch-event mistake of violating federal elections laws by soliciting more than the sanctioned limit. In the letter he asks that donors consider a donation no larger than \u201cthe maximum gift of $2,700\u201d (and if he makes it to a general they get to give that much again). The fundraising letter reads in part: Please join my campaign for President by making an immediate donation of $25, $50, $100, $500 or even the maximum gift of $2,700. Your immediate and generous donation is critical to building early momentum for our campaign and to putting American workers and families first again. Let me be clear, I\u2019m a Republican not because I grew up rich. I\u2019m a Republican because I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me. Clinton\u2019s in the building: Hillary Clinton is scheduled to talk about immigration policy at Rancho High School in Las Vegas this afternoon: A strange story from Capitol Hill \u2013 two lost handguns \u2013 in two bathrooms \u2013 connected to the two top Republicans in Congress. One pistol discovered in January, one in March, but neither Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell nor House speaker John Boehner was informed at the time, Roll Call reports. The incidents were revealed when Roll Coll on 30 April obtained a report to the Capitol police board. First, a member of McConnell\u2019s security detail apparently left his Glock pistol hanging from a dispenser for toilet seat covers in a bathroom stall at the Capitol Visitor Center\u2019s Senate office space. \u201cA CVC worker found the gun on Jan. 29, resulting in a recommendation of six days of unpaid suspension for the officer,\u201d Roll Call reported. \u201cLeader McConnell learned about these incidents last week,\u201d Michael Brumas said in an email to CQ Roll Call... In the second incident, \u201cBoehner spokesman Michael Steel also confirmed his boss was not aware until last week of the March 24 incident, when a child visiting the Capitol with his parents allegedly found a loaded Glock lost by a dignitary protection officer in the bathroom of the Speaker\u2019s Suite,\u201d Roll Call reports. It\u2019s still nearly two hours before Hillary Clinton is due to speak in Las Vegas and as long as we\u2019re disinterring awesome famous people from Mike Huckabee\u2019s past... The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs (@bencjacobs) (back when he was the Daily Beast\u2019s Ben Jacobs) reported that Huckabee had criticized President Barack Obama and the first lady for allowing their daughters to listen to Beyonc\u00e9, whose lyrics Huckabee has described as \u201cobnoxious and toxic mental poison\u201d: The former Arkansas governor also expressed concern about the pop star\u2019s marriage to Jay Z, wondering whether the rapper \u201cis arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?\u201d So which one is it, America? Chuck Norris or Beyonc\u00e9? You can\u2019t have both. Repeat candidates can\u2019t count on repeat endorsements from whoever backed them last time, even where old friends are concerned. Just ask the Clintons. But there\u2019s one presidential endorser who does not change. Who is not swayed by political fashion or polls or headline hype. An endorser who invented the martial art Chun Kuk Do, and who loves plaid, and who on Monday warned of a federal government plot to take over the state of Texas. His name: Chuck Norris. \u201cI still believe Mike Huckabee is the most qualified,\u201d Norris told the New York Times in a statement published Tuesday. \u201cHe has the moral clarity and experience to lead our great country forward.\u201d For more on the Norris warning about the supposed government plot to take over Texas, read the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt: Writing on the right-wing website WND, or WorldNetDaily, Norris discussed the potential for Jade Helm 15, a US military training exercise planned for July and August, to turn into a full-scale occupation of his home state. \u201cThe US government says, \u2018It\u2019s just a training exercise\u2019,\u201d wrote Norris, 75. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure the term \u2018just\u2019 has any reference to reality when the government uses it.\u201d Would Norris be OK with a federal government takeover of Texas if Mike Huckabee were president? There\u2019s only one way to find out. Mike Huckabee: an outrageous big government conservative? Read Ben Jacobs (@bencjacobs) on the newest entry in the Republican presidential field: But, to some in the conservative movement who are far more concerned about economic issues than social causes, Huckabee is anathema. Perhaps Huckabee\u2019s biggest intraparty political opponent over the past two decades has been the Club for Growth, the powerful pro-business Republican Pac. As Dave Weigel at Bloomberg News noted, Huckabee has feuded with the group since a 2001 battle over a congressional primary in north-west Arkansas, and the battle has continued since then. Read the full piece here. Hillary Clinton\u2019s sole-so-far opponent takes one on the chin from the Socialist Worker: From the piece: But in running for the Democratic presidential nomination as the liberal outsider with almost no chance of winning, Sanders isn\u2019t very \u201cbold\u201d--no more so than the fizzled campaigns of Dennis Kucinich in past presidential election years. And by steering liberal and left supporters into a Democratic Party whose policies and politics he claims to disagree with, Sanders--no matter how critical he might be of Hillary Clinton--is acting as the opposite of an \u201calternative.\u201d Full piece here. Did you participate in our earlier fake Mike Huckabee titles quiz? Here are the answers! Never Say Diet was authored by Richard Simmons \u2013 not Mike Huckabee Sappho\u2019s Leap was authored by Erica Jong \u2013 not Mike Huckabee Masters of Greatness was authored by Jean K Foster \u2013 not Mike Huckabee The other 11 titles on the list \u2013 all Mike Huckabee books, and that includes \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and \u201cKids Who Kill.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Matt Sullivan (@sullduggery) flags a Fiorina line about a potential general-election competitor, Hillary Clinton. \u201cObviously I\u2019m running to beat Hillary Clinton, but I think it\u2019s a great thing that there are women on both sides of the aisle who are running for the highest office in the land,\u201d Fiorina says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a token in my life. ... \u201cThe first thing out of people\u2019s mouths is not, \u2018Oh my gosh, you\u2019re a woman\u2019 ... the first thing out of people\u2019s mouths is, \u2018Oh my gosh, you\u2019re not a politician\u2019.\u201d Fiorina went on to describe some contrasts between men and women as she sees them. She said women want longer conversations and men want shorter. She said women get turned off by vitriol and a political culture that prizes sound bytes. So we know whom Fiorina thought she was speaking to when she said in March, \u201cHillary Clinton lacks a track record of accomplishment. She is not candid, which suggests her character is flawed.\u201d Fiorina is off. The TechCrunch moderator, Sarah Lane, asks Fiorina a final question: If she doesn\u2019t win the presidency, would she consider a run at the vice presidency? Fiorina: \u201cAnd you see, would you ever ask a man running for president that?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says Lane. \u201cWell you haven\u2019t, so I\u2019m going to have to take you at your word,\u201d says Fiorina. \u201cI\u2019m not running for something else. I\u2019m running because I think I can win this job, and I think I can do this job. \u201cI think we can\u2019t just say that somehow, the political class is all that we need. It\u2019s a modern invention actually.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Matt Sullivan checks in on Fiorina. Our Rupert Neate (@RupertNeate) is at the event. You can watch a live stream here. Carly Fiorina is onstage at a TechCrunch \u201cDisrupt\u201d event in New York City. The presidential-candidate-as-of-yesterday jokes about not claiming carlyfiorina.org until it was too late. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy every domain name,\u201d Fiorina says. \u201cHopefully people will go to Carly for President instead ...\u201d For further reading: Trolling in the name of Republicans: website squatters beat candidates to the punch Then she begins talking tech. It\u2019s difficult to conceive of an onstage turn by a candidate that could be less like the one we just saw from Huckabee. \u201cBack in 1999, there were some artificial things pushing the dot-com boom,\u201d Fiorina says. \u201cThere was Y2K, there was a very aggressive buildout ... that was in many ways not sustainable... \u201cWe\u2019re [now in] a rather frothy time,\u201d with lots of money being spend on apps and not as much on manufacturing, she says. This Upshot analysis of Huckabee\u2019s prospects points out that unlike in 2008, when Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses in part by winning evangelical voters from John McCain and Mitt Romney, in 2016 Huckabee will be competing against candidates who may offer viable alternatives for evangelicals: Ted Cruz or Scott Walker or even Rand Paul. The analysis points out that Huckabee is a relatively weak candidate in terms of funding and organizational strength, but that the Baptist minister could still exert pressure in a race in which white evangelical Christians will make up about 40% of Republican primary voters. Here\u2019s a challenge for our readers: name the THREE titles below that are NOT Mike Huckabee books (answers to come later) (no Googling): UPDATE: Answers are here God, Guns, Grits and Gravy Quit Digging Your Grave With a Knife and Fork! Never Say Diet Character Makes a Difference Living Beyond Your Lifetime Sappho\u2019s Leap A Simple Christmas A Simple Government Do the Right Thing Kids Who Kill Master of Greatness From Hope to Higher Ground Dear Chandler, Dear Scarlett Character Is the Issue The Washington Post points out that Huckabee\u2019s joke about welcoming anybody who wanted to give him a million dollars was technically a violation of campaign finance law, since federal candidates can\u2019t solicit more than the contribution limit. The Post: \u201cA federal candidate cannot solicit a million dollars, let\u2019s start there,\u201d said Larry Noble of the Campaign Legal Center when the Post reached him by telephone. \u201cIf he\u2019s there announcing his candidacy, he cannot ask anybody for a million dollars. The most he can ask is the contribution limit; from a PAC that\u2019s $5,000.\u201d Full piece here. But good news for Huckabee! The chairwoman of the FEC, the regulator in charge of campaign finance, is telling anybody who will listen that there are basically no rules for 2016, because there\u2019s no enforcing them. The New York Times: The leader of the Federal Election Commission, the agency charged with regulating the way political money is raised and spent, says she has largely given up hope of reining in abuses in the 2016 presidential campaign, which could generate a record $10 billion in spending. The likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim,\u201d Ann M. Ravel, the chairwoman, said in an interview. \u201cI never want to give up, but I\u2019m not under any illusions. People think the F.E.C. is dysfunctional. It\u2019s worse than dysfunctional.\u201d Read that full miserable piece here. Here\u2019s Jeb Bush in a new video extending his best wishes to Spanish speakers on the occasion of Cinco de Mayo, the holiday that began as a Mexican celebration of a 19th-century military victory over the French. Bush is so fluent in Spanish this doesn\u2019t even count as showing off his Spanish: (h/t: @moneyries) As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of the Huckabee rollout: Mike Huckabee, the Republican former governor of Arkansas, announced he is running for president, proposing to take the country \u201cfrom Hope to higher ground.\u201d Huckabee pitched his candidacy as a combination of curing what\u2019s wrong with Washington but protecting nice government things such as Social Security and Medicare. Huckabee tried on his culture warrior armor with a line about the \u201cslaughter of 50 million babies\u201d from abortion and a lot of talk about faith and god and Faith in God. The biggest applause line may have been about Iran, however. If he were president, Huckabee told the crowd, \u201cthe ayatollahs of Iran would know that hell would freeze over before they get a nuclear weapon.\u201d \u201cWe want Mike! We want Mike! We want Mike!\u201d people chanted. Huckabee resurrected a proposal from his 2008 run for a tax on consumption he calls the Fair Tax to replace income taxes. Huckabee called for abolishing the department of education and the IRS. No bass was played in the making of this event. At least not by Huckabee. There was a heck of a lot of (new-) country music. If you\u2019re tempted to write off Mike Huckabee\u2019s candidacy, here\u2019s an important reminder from 2008, in the run-up to the victory in Iowa: The Guardian\u2019s Jessica Lee (@jessicalee27) is tracking the hashtag #fromhopetohigherground on Twitter. Some people are using it, but it\u2019s difficult to tell what they think about it because by the time they type it they\u2019re out of characters. #hopetohigherground is showing some activity too. We appear however not quite to be in \u201cavalanching national trend\u201d territory yet. The candidate ends with a story about his father, who died just before he became governor, watching him from heaven as he, Huckabee, was inaugurated: I always want to think that he did see that moment, from the best seat in the house. And I hope that he\u2019s able to watch... when that bashful little kid... is sworn in as the president of the United States. And with your help and god\u2019s, we will make that journey from hope to higher ground! Anybody for some Brooks &amp; Dunn? Only in America, the hit is called: Huckabee has a bunch of catchy campaign slogans. He way outstrips, for example, Ben Carson, in this category of campaigning. Packaging your message and delivering the package. He\u2019s just repeated his line about not fighting over a minimum wage \u2013 he wants to fight for a maximum wage! Then he says the country needs to feed itself, fuel itself and fight for itself. Then, seamlessly, he falls into pass-the-hat mode: $25-a-month contributions can take us from Hope to higher ground. Now rest assured, if you want to give a million dollars, please do it. \u201cI\u2019ve walked away from my own income to do this...\u201d Huckabee says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a global foundation... I grew up blue collar, not just blue blood.\u201d I\u2019m asking you to join me today, not just so I can be president... so that your children and grandchildren can someday go from Hope to higher ground. Oh good, Huckabee is returning to a tax plan he pitched last time around: a tax on consumption he calls the Fair Tax: As president, I\u2019ll work to pass the Fair Tax, which would no longer penalize people\u2019s work. Huckabee promises to abolish \u201cthe biggest bully\u201d in the country, the IRS. \u201cThe IRS would disappear and April 15 would be just another beautiful spring day,\u201d he says. Huckabee says the department of education has \u201cflunked and it needs to be expelled.\u201d Get it. He\u2019s against common core standards for national student testing. On to immigration: \u201cWe need to start by taking control of our borders. But as Americans, we ought to get on our knees every night, and thank god we live in a country that Americans are trying to get in to, rather than one they\u2019re trying to get out of.\u201d Applause applause applause. Huckabee\u2019s moving quickly though, he\u2019s already on to the need for a law requiring Congress to balance the budget. Huckabee flexes some of that preacher\u2019s anti-abortion muscle: \u201cWe have watched the slaughter of 50m babies by choice.\u201d Huckabee focuses blame for what he has elsewhere called the \u201cholocaust of liberalized abortion\u201d on the judiciary: \u201cThe supreme court is not the supreme being, and they cannot turn over the laws of nature or of nature\u2019s god.\u201d Huckabee comes out in strong defense of Israeli West Bank settlements: We face real threats from radical jihadism... but we put more pressure on our ally Israel to cease building bedrooms for their families in Judea and Sumeria than we do on Iran for building a bomb.\u201d Biggest applause line so far, by far: We would deal with jihadis just as we would with deadly snakes... and the ayatollahs of Iran would know that hell would freeze over before they get a nuclear weapon. Huckabee names another problem with Washington: \u201cunbalanced trade deals that forgo congressional scrutiny\u201d and the inflow to the country of low-wage workers \u201cthat drive wagers lower than the Dead Sea.\u201d Huckabee is pitching his record Arkansas governor for ten years. He cites family income increases, tax cuts, repaired roads. Then he moves through a theme that separates him from some of his Republican peers: The importance of protecting Social Security and Medicare. \u201cAs president I promise, you will get what you pay for,\u201d Huckabee tells seniors. That\u2019s an applause line. Huckabee\u2019s refrain here is \u201cfrom Hope to higher ground.\u201d It works because of the city he\u2019s speaking in. But it also works as a dig at the sitting president, whom he has just mentioned, though not by name. It was only eight years ago a young senator was talking about hope, Huckabee says. But that hasn\u2019t worked out. Huckabee has moved on to a tribute to veterans of wars. \u201cBut friend, we owe them more than a pat on the back. We need to take them from Hope to Higher Ground.\u201d Huckabee announces. The crowd cheers. He smiles happily. The camera pans back from the stage. There\u2019s a chant: \u201cWe want Mike! We want Mike!\u201d Huckabee cracks a joke: \u201cWell I\u2019m glad you reacted that way. It would have been a very lonely day had you been quiet,\u201d he says. Huckabee hits his favorite themes right away. Too much power is concentrated in Washington. Hard work doesn\u2019t pay in America like it used to. And god-fearing small-town America holds the future. \u201cThey sweat through their clothes... but in some cases can\u2019t even stay even,\u201d Huckabee says of working families in 2015. But then comes a weird line, meant to underscore how firearm ownership does not imply criminality, but landing a bit strangely and with a half-chuckle by the candidate, who realizes it: It was here in Hope that I learned how to handle a firearm and a fishing pole. ...I learned the basic rules of gun safety and I never thought of using a firearm to murder someone. Huckabee comes on. To yet more Montgomery Gentry, a band that whatever it knew apparently well knew its address, this time \u201cWhere I come from\u201d: After Janet we get a little Montgomery Gentry, My Town: How great is this Huckabee event? Meh. It\u2019s cleanly produced. Feels a bit scripted next to the Carson event yesterday. Huckabee has a lectern with his campaign logo on it and everything. The logo looks a lot like the Bank of America. Janet Huckabee is telling about the earlier years of her marriage. She says Huckabee\u2019s plan was to become a rock star, \u201cthe fifth Beatle.\u201d But that didn\u2019t work. But being president is better than being a Beatle. Right? Some of these photos of the young Huckabee family are cute cute cute. Here\u2019s Janet Huckabee on video: And now she takes the stage in person. \u201cMike and Janet, we are here today to tell you that Arkansas is on your side!\u201d Hutchinson\u2019s done. Next is a testimonial video by Janet Huckabee. She begins with a description of her spinal cancer diagnosis at age 19 \u2013 when she was already married to the future governor. \u201cIf he coulda left me, he should\u2019ve done it right then. And he made a decision to stick it out.\u201d Governor Hutchinson, just elected in November, is less than totally electrifying, some say. \u201cTime magazine called Mike Huckabee one of the best governors in America. And they were right about that.\u201d Mild applause. And in the interests of comprehensiveness, for when the judges will have to decide whether Mike Huckabee or Ben Carson had more awesome launch event music, Hutchinson came onstage to Randy Houser\u2019s country hit, How Country Feels. The lyrics are kind of risqu\u00e9! You never rolled in the hay You never thrown it in four wheel Climb up on here girl Let me show you how country feels Let your hair down, hair down Get you some of this laid on back Kick your shoes off, kick \u2018em off Get you some of this slow down fast I\u2019ll take you up and down these hollers and hills Let me show you how country feels Tony Orlando! Of course. Is Huckabee\u2019s emcee. He\u2019s now singing his \u201cAmerica is my Hometown.\u201d He\u2019s reading the lyrics from a music stand. \u201cThank you ladies and gentlemen! God Bless You and God bless Mike Huckabee. And god bless America.\u201d Orlando leaves the stage. Here\u2019s Asa Hutchinson, the current Arkansas governor. Here\u2019s who sang the anthem. They looked great. Would it be churlish to question the perfection of their harmony on the \u201cland of the free\u201d part? Yes. Yes it would. Ooh Huckabee has Boy Scouts. Carson didn\u2019t have that. Here\u2019s an honor guard presenting the flag. Then we\u2019ll have a Pledge of Allegiance \u2013 also missing from the Carson event \u2013 and a singing of the Star-Spangled Banner. Now the prayer. That\u2019s just one song before the prayer, compared with Carson\u2019s eight. Advantage: Carson. This prayer is sounding pretty good though. \u201cWe are so grateful for the work that You\u2019ve done in the life of Mike Huckabee to prepare him for a time such as this.\u201d We have the opening number. It\u2019s Wayne Newton \u2013 no not Wayne Newton \u2013 it\u2019s a different lounge singer hitting the crowd with Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree, the humorous standard about young love. Too obvious? Did you watch the Ben Carson launch event in Detroit yesterday? The one with his wife on violin and the two choirs singing Eminem and The Battle Hymn of the Republic and the hit from the musical Carousel? If there\u2019s one candidate who can blow Carson right out of the water, in terms of show tunes and good-time singin\u2019, that candidate is Mike Huckabee. Let\u2019s see what he\u2019s got. Good morning and welcome to the day in next year\u2019s politics. We need to get right down to business, because in a matter of mere minutes Mike Huckabee, the Fox News personality, former governor of Arkansas and 2008 presidential candidate, is expected to announce that he\u2019s back in the hunt for the White House. Huckabee is holding an event in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s hometown, too, coincidentally, although they didn\u2019t know one another as kids. After Huckabee announces, we\u2019re going to pick up an event with Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive who announced her own candidacy yesterday. Finally, it\u2019s on to Sin City, where Hillary Clinton is scheduled to make a speech about immigration reform. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino will be in the crowd. Here comes Huckabee! Who likes Skynard?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
