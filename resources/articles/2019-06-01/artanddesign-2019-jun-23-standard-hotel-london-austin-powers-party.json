Inside the risqu\u00e9 hotel for 24-hour party people", "bodyText": "When the clerks of Camden\u2019s highways department were issuing parking fines from their gloomy office in the 1970s, little can they have imagined that jet-setting hipsters would one day be supping cocktails in the public library below them before taking an al fresco dip up on the roof. Maligned for years as the concrete \u201cegg box\u201d of Euston Road, the old council headquarters have been reborn as the glamorous Standard Hotel, the first outpost of the risque boutique chain outside the US. \u201cPeople thought we were crazy to suggest open-air bathtubs in London,\u201d says Shawn Hausman, the Los Angeles-based designer behind the Standard\u2019s flamboyant interiors, who started out creating film sets for Saturday Night Fever. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s always nice to have a bath outside, even in the rain.\u201d Naked bodies bobbing above the rooftops is par for the course for a chain with a reputation for racy touches. Its first hotel, which opened on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in 1999, features live models in a vitrine behind the reception desk, part of an art installation called The Box. Its New York flagship, which straddles the High Line park, takes voyeurism to the next level via the celebrity-frequented Boom Boom Room, an exclusive club that boasts four sitdown toilets in a single cubicle. Then there are its full-height bedroom windows, which have given the hotel a reputation as a site of sexual exhibitionism (encouraged by raunchy scenes in Steve McQueen\u2019s film Shame being shot there). The price of a room is listed on the restaurant\u2019s dessert menu, and where other hotels put the Gideon Bible, here you\u2019ll find condoms and ibuprofen. Is this what\u2019s in store for what was, until recently, a bastion of council bureaucracy? Built in 1977 by Camden\u2019s esteemed in-house architects\u2019 department, the town hall annexe had long been seen as a concrete carbuncle. It was listed in the local conservation area plan as making a \u201cnegative contribution\u201d, its rough pre-cast facade looming across the road from George Gilbert Scott\u2019s gothic fantasy of St Pancras station like a cheese-grater. When Scott\u2019s creation was reborn as luxury apartments and a swanky hotel in 2011, it was only a matter of time before Camden cashed in on the location and architectural heritage of its own offices. Such muscular works of brutalism were rapidly becoming the subject of coffee-table books and tea towels \u2013 and being eyed up by trendy hotel chains looking to make a statement. Facing hefty repair bills for lifts and services, the council sold the leaky hulk in 2014 for almost \u00a360m, transferring its offices to a new block just to the north, saving an estimated \u00a3500,000 a year. For the Standard, which had been scouting in London for a decade, it was the perfect fit. \u201cWe thought all we needed to do was put a logo on it,\u201d says managing director Bruce Robertson. The reality wasn\u2019t so simple. To make the project viable, a three-storey \u201ccrown\u201d has been added, supported by threading new steel columns through the existing structure, whose facade has been scrubbed a gleaming white, while the brown-tinted windows have been replaced with clear curved glazing specially manufactured by a boatbuilding company. Orms architects have made it look as good as new, finishing it off with a jaunty red bubble lift so guests can feel like they\u2019re being shuttled up the facade in a flying phone box. This flash of glossy red is a hint of what lies within. Anyone who remembers queueing up inside the council\u2019s concrete colossus to sort out their housing benefit won\u2019t recognise the place. Working with interior architects Archer Humphryes, Hausman\u2019s team has conjured a surreal vision of swinging London: a souped-up Austin Powers world of enamel optical-art murals and moulded ceramic wall features, with a hoard of vintage furniture sourced from the jazziest corners of eBay. \u201cWe were inspired by a range of movies, from Fahrenheit 451 to Silent Running and Logan\u2019s Run,\u201d says Hausman, \u201cas well as the iconic aesthetics of the London Underground. Mid-century Italian design played a big part too.\u201d A reception desk striped with exotic hardwoods stands in front of a bulging blue and red ceramic wall by Lubna Chowdhary, recalling the Paolozzi mosaics at Tottenham Court Road station, while a chunky pink terrazzo floor leads visitors through to what was once St Pancras public library. It is now a lounge bar themed around an imagined 1970s library, complete with an in-house librarian who will curate a selection of \u201cradical\u201d books. \u201cThe original library was not so aesthetically pleasing,\u201d says Hausman, \u201cso we\u2019ve invented the kind we would have liked to find here.\u201d It is evidently the fictional library of a design aficionado: alongside retro veneered bookshelves are collectible pieces of Memphis furniture, baggy leather Saporiti sofas, and a ceiling dotted with red globe fixtures. To one side stands a \u201csounds lounge\u201d recording booth, where musicians and DJs will make podcasts and record interviews, while around the corner lies the first of several restaurants, complete with a \u201cfermentation bar\u201d. The interiors exude the retro charm of a Wes Anderson film set, but there is something unsavoury about a place once designed for public services being co-opted as a luxury lifestyle destination. It\u2019s like Hackney\u2019s former Asian Women\u2019s Advisory Service being crassly reborn as The Advisory hipster burger bar. At least in this case, St Pancras library has a bright new home in the Kings Cross development, where a new public swimming pool and leisure centre have also been provided beneath the new council offices \u2013 an amenity the hotel itself lacks. The Standard claims its ground floor will be as \u201cdemocratic\u201d as possible, with a dive bar-style venue spilling on to a passage, and a new public garden to the south where a closed route has been opened up. It was the only bidder for the site that proposed keeping the building \u2013 others planned to raze it in favour of a tower. When brutalist gems like the nearby Welbeck Street car park are being demolished to make way for lumpen new hotels, the vision to reuse such a massive concrete edifice should be applauded. The bedrooms \u2013 which range from \u00a3150 to over \u00a31,000 per night \u2013 continue the transport theme, with the curved windows recalling those of a ferry, along with tightly pleated train-style curtains and bold geometric bedspreads by Wallace &amp; Sewell (fabric designers for Transport for London) complementing window seats in burgundy Harris tweed. Suspended ceilings have been ripped out to reveal the concrete waffle-slabs, while the open-plan bathrooms are an on-trend Pinterest board come alive, with riotous symphonies of bubblegum pink and navy blue tiles punctuated by mint taps. Others aren\u2019t as appealing. Across the boldly-carpeted corridors \u2013 designed as \u201can archaeological dig of 1970s patterns\u201d \u2013 lie what are being marketed as \u201cCosy Core\u201d rooms, a euphemism for windowless bunkers. It is here that the challenges of converting a deep-plan office into a functioning hotel are most sorely felt \u2013 a substantial block of rooms in the centre won\u2019t enjoy a chink of daylight. \u201cIt would be illegal in the US,\u201d Hausman admits, \u201cbut here it was a great opportunity to exceed expectations of what a windowless room could be.\u201d Aimed at jet-lagged travellers and nocturnal party animals, the rooms have a loungey hungover vibe, with low corner-sofas that meld into the beds, and long wood-floored showers filled with plastic plants in the hope of distracting guests from their light-starved existence. The heady climax, which won\u2019t open until later in the year, is found at the top of the crown, where one side will be a Latin-themed restaurant run by a double-Michelin-starred chef, imagined as a 1970s tropical plant-strewn lair of macram\u00e9 curtains, rattan ceiling panels and raised terraces of crazy paving. On the other side will be an opulent 24-hour-licensed venue with faceted mirror ceilings, leather banquettes and what the designers describe as a \u201cbig, boisterous, spectacular curtain\u201d, drawn back to reveal five-metre high curved windows looking out over King\u2019s Cross \u2013 London\u2019s very own version of New York\u2019s Boom Boom Room. Longtime local residents will be astonished that such a thing could ever appear on the Euston Road, but it completes the rapid mutation of this once-seedy district into London\u2019s gilded \u201cgateway to Europe\u201d, where the likes of Google, LVMH and Universal Music rub shoulders with one of the country\u2019s best art schools, Central Saint Martin\u2019s \u2013 and where rooftop bathers will now be able to wave across to hedge fund managers living in the former railway offices of St Pancras.
