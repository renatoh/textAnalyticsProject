Perhaps, it is assumed that incumbent captain Michael Hooper will continue in the role he has performed for the last three years. Hooper is well regarded. Mature beyond his years when he arrived on the Super Rugby scene with the Brumbies in 2010, he was only 22 when he led the NSW Waratahs to their maiden title in 2014, taking over from the injured Dave Dennis mid-season. When former captain Stephen Moore announced his intention to retire from Test rugby in 2017, Hooper was immediately given the armband. Since then, with a work-rate second to none, Hooper has led the Wallabies by example. But with the change of coach, is it also time to reconsider the captaincy? Hooper was closely associated with Michael Cheika, perhaps more so than any other player, and the ball-in-hand style of game the team played. Last year, under the their joint leadership, the Wallabies experienced their worst season since 1958, winning just four of 13 Tests. The Wallabies then produced their poorest result at a World Cup in Japan, losing a key pool match to Wales before being eliminated by England in the quarter-final. Cheika\u2019s selections and tactics in Japan were heavily criticised. Having vowed to step down if Australia did not win the tournament, he did not seek re-appointment, but there was little chance of that happening. An incoming coach will often change captain to stamp his authority on the team and send a strong message the side is heading in a new direction. Since the advent of professionalism in the mid-1990s almost every new Wallaby coach has replaced the captain he inherited, even if not straight away. But if Rennie wanted to change captain, who would he turn to? Australian rugby is in danger of experiencing a leadership vacuum, having lost an enormous amount of leadership experience following the World Cup in Japan. Wallaby vice-captain and Queensland Reds leader Samu Kerevi and his Brumbies counterpart Christian Lealiifano are leaving Australia to play in Japan, while other leaders such as David Pocock, Will Genia, Bernard Foley and Adam Coleman are also heading overseas. That leaves only Hooper, Brumbies prop James Slipper and Melbourne Rebels outside back Dane Haylett-Petty as experienced leaders. As Slipper and Haylett-Petty would not be guaranteed a place in the Test starting line-up, they would not be candidates. So Hooper may retain his position in the short-term at least simply because there is simply no one else, unless Rennie sees leadership qualities in someone who is yet to be identified as a Test captain. Or Rennie may decide Hooper is the best man for the job and try to develop an effective working relationship with him. At 28 years of age Hooper is still young enough to lead the Wallabies to the next World Cup in France in 2023. Another potential option is for Rennie to introduce a model which he used at both the Chiefs and the Glasgow Warriors \u2013 co-captaincy. When he took over the reins of the Chiefs in 2012 he was forced to appoint a new captain to replace All Blacks fullback Mils Muliaina, who headed overseas. Rennie chose Craig Clarke and Liam Messam, who led the Chiefs to back to back Super Rugby titles in 2012 and 2013. When Rennie was installed in Glasgow in 2017 one of his first decisions was to replace co-captains Jonny Gray and Henry Pyrgos with Ryan Wilson. But Rennie reverted to co-captaincy for the 2018-19 season with Callum Gibbins joining Wilson in the dual leadership position. It would not be the first time the Wallabies have had co-captains. At the start of the 2007 international season former Wallaby coach John Connolly named Stirling Mortlock and Phil Waugh as co-captains, although Mortlock led the team to the World Cup in France later that year. The co-captaincy model would give the team continuity with Hooper, assuming he made the starting line-up, and also allow Rennie to install his own man in the shared role. The coach-captain relationship is crucial to a team\u2019s success. Just about every World Cup-winning team has had a strong coach-captain combination, including the Wallabies\u2019 victorious sides in 1991 and 1999. Bob Dwyer and Nick Farr-Jones enjoyed a great relationship in 1991, while Rod Macqueen developed a wonderful rapport with John Eales in 1999. The bond between Cheika and Hooper was just a strong, but not as successful, at least not at Test level. Whether Rennie retains Hooper as captain or appoints a new skipper will be one of the most important decisions he will make as Wallaby coach, one that could define his era."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
