Michael Buffong, the artistic director of Talawa theatre company in Croydon, said more than a dozen black frontline workers would be interviewed and their experiences turned into six online plays for Tales from the Front Line. \u201cWe\u2019re not being told about the contribution of black workers. It is not been recorded or documented,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we should mark this so that when this story is told back in 10 years\u2019 time, our contributions are represented.\u201d Buffong said the erasure of the contribution made by black soldiers during the world wars, and the fact that few people knew about the black footballer picked to play for England in the 1920s, were examples of Britain\u2019s missing history. He said: \u201cYou tell people about the black soldiers in the world wars, and they say \u2018really?\u2019 Or that the first black footballer was around in 1918. Somehow these things mysteriously don\u2019t get documented.\u201d The project will feature accounts from healthcare professionals, delivery drivers, supermarket staff, social housing officers and other frontline workers, who Buffong said had gone from vilified to valued because they provided vital services during lockdown. Buffong said the fact that mortality risks were highest for black men and women had also influenced the project. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Covid-19, we would be talking about Brexit and the Windrush scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought: isn\u2019t that amazing? There are two kinds of hostility facing immigrants and people they deem shouldn\u2019t be in the country. It turns out that these are the people who are keeping the country alive.\u201d He said theatre\u2019s directness and ability to quickly turn around work made the project an efficient way to record workers\u2019 experiences during the crisis. \u201cI think it\u2019s one place where you can have conversations relatively quickly, that are important, and are of the moment. That\u2019s why these spaces are so important.\u201d Buffong said he had opted for the verbatim format \u2013 where the interviewees\u2019 words provide the text of the plays \u2013 because he wanted \u201cthe story straight from the workers themselves\u201d. \u201cI did a play many years ago called Black Poppies, which was about black soldiers in the British army. We interviewed soldiers who have done tours of Northern Ireland, and their stories weren\u2019t told. This feels like one of those moments.\u201d Billed as \u201can interrogation of the society most impacted by Covid-19, and the society that will emerge from it,\u201d Tales from the Front Line will be shown on the theatre\u2019s website in the autumn. Last week more than 400 actors and theatre figures including Paapa Essiedu and the Hamilton star Jamael Westman called on the British theatre industry to implement \u201cactionable reform\u201d that would make the sector more inclusive. Buffong, who has been artistic director at Talawa since 2011, said diverse theatre work was under threat as institutions faced pressure to save money amid heavy job losses in the sector. He said: \u201cIt is the time to safeguard stories from black and Asian minority ethnic groups and from the deaf and disabled. This is the time because we might be the first stories to go. Especially if we\u2019re perceived as being \u2018risky\u2019, in inverted commas.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
