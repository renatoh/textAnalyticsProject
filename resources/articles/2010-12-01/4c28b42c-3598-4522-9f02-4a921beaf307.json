But when the insult was hurled at Jeremy Hunt by student protesters it was something of a relief. It happened as the culture, media and sport secretary was returning to Westminster last Thursday afternoon, on foot, from a meeting at Buckingham Palace where he had been discussing next year's royal wedding. But as he approached Parliament Square he saw the crowds. If he was to get to the Commons vote on tuition fees on time, he knew he would have to fight his way through the angry protesters. \"I made the call that no one would recognise me and it turned out not to be the case,\" he said. \"Someone with a loudspeaker spotted me and shouted 'Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, is walking through!'.\" It was the last thing he wanted. Three days before, two Radio 4 presenters \u2013 James Naughtie on the Today programme and Andrew Marr on Start the Week \u2013 accidentally got their tongues in tangles within an hour of each other, both calling him Jeremy Cunt. The hitherto little recognised cabinet minister instantly became a household name as the story hit every website and the nation guffawed at his expense. As Hunt pressed on, he feared the worst. But the chorus of C-words never came. \"I was called 'Tory scum' for the first time in my life, and I am sure not the last. There were no C-words,\" he said laughing. Hunt looks back on the Naughtie and Marr gaffes with a humour that his father, Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, and his mother, did not share when they tuned in, proudly, to hear their son on last Monday's Today. \"I think my parents took a bit of time to see the funny side,\" he said. Hunt, a contemporary of David Cameron at Oxford University, is seen by Tory colleagues as one of the party's most ambitious politicians. Some view him as a future Tory leader. Rather than shy away from challenges, he takes them on. To prove it, he was happy to grant the Observer an interview in the week of all weeks. Aged 44, he is one of the younger cabinet ministers in Cameron's team. He is also one of the richest. After Oxford, where he took a first in politics, philosophy and economics, he taught English in Japan before working in PR and then co-founding Hotcourses, an educational publishing firm. He entered the Commons in 2005 with a fortune estimated at \u00a34.5m. While no one would suggest the slips by two experienced BBC presenters were in any way premeditated, Hunt has not made himself popular among some at the corporation. He has criticised the salaries of senior BBC executives and frozen the licence fee until 2017, believing it needed to learn some lessons about how better to use public money. A few months ago John Simpson, the BBC world affairs editor, had Hunt in his sights when he talked about the corporation's \"noisy enemies\". Referring to Hunt's plans to develop a network of US-style local TV stations, Simpson said: \"We have a secretary of state that actually thinks Birmingham, Alabama, has a better broadcasting structure than the BBC has.\" Hunt is careful to praise much about the BBC. \"It is one of our crown jewels,\" he says. \"It produces fantastic TV programmes.\" And it has \"probably the most respected news service in the world\". He defends its independence and arm's-length relationship with government. \"We are not Italy. We do not have a new government that says we are going to put all our key people in the key positions in a state controlled media.\" But in terms that will do nothing to endear him to enemies inside the BBC, he presumes to know how most of them vote at elections \u2013 and it is not the way he would like. \"I think if you were to discover how people vote at the BBC there are probably more who vote Labour or Liberal Democrat than vote for the Conservatives.\" That said, he is careful to add that for the vast majority \"their commitment to independent journalism comes before any political affiliation\". Hunt thinks the BBC has shown institutional bias down the years. \"I think the BBC does recognise that on certain very totemic issues of the last decade it was out of step with where the public are, whether it was on Europe, on immigration or our approach to Northern Ireland.\" Quietly spoken but strikingly firm in his opinions, he was clearly furious that Panorama ran its expos\u00e9 of alleged corruption at Fifa days before he and Cameron headed to Zurich to push England's bid for the 2018 World Cup. He says the decision was \"a nightmare\" for them and one that damaged the bid. But he cautiously defends the corporation's right to have done so. Clearly Hunt sees his job at culture, media and sport as a stepping stone on a journey to much bigger things. The speed with which he agreed to big cuts in funding for the arts in the face of fierce opposition, and the way he fell into line with plans to slash state funding for university arts and humanities courses, show he is not too fussed about offending the arts crowd. His latest proposals to boost philanthropy and the \"big society\" by encouraging rich people to leave 10% of their estates to charity will only have endeared him further to the prime minister. Indeed, Hunt is championing Cameron's pet project as aggressively as any minister. With hundreds of libraries facing closure, he believes the volunteer spirit can save them. \"It is right that authorities take a fresh look at how to deliver their services,\" he says. \"Over the last 10 years we have seen the numbers of people volunteering in libraries increasing. Volunteers regularly help to deliver homework clubs, digitisation projects and 'buddy support' for people new to computers in libraries. Authorities should have staff that have the right mix of skills and attributes to fulfil the needs of the community they serve and there's no reason why some of this can't come from the voluntary sector. Ultimately the decision lies with the local authority.\" Where necessary, however, Hunt is also prepared to join some real battles with colleagues to show his mettle. He is staunchly defending the cause of sport for young people against Michael Gove's proposals to end \u00a3162m of ringfenced funding for school sports partnerships. However, he chooses his words carefully when distancing himself from the education secretary's approach. \"The challenge that Michael Gove has is that he has inherited a system where in terms of the number of children doing competitive sport he is not satisfied that it is doing as well as it should.\" What he does not say is that he agrees with Gove's view. Because he doesn't. Hunt speaks up for school sport organised through specialist sports colleges. \"The evidence is very clear that schools that do sport properly get better academic results, it improves concentration, it improves health and wellbeing, it improves discipline. Specialist sports colleges are the fastest improving colleges in terms of academic standards of all secondary schools. So the evidence is very clear.\" Hunt has made blunders in his time in government. In July he misfired in a TV interview when he suggested that the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 had been caused by hooliganism, when in fact failures of crowd control were the cause. Families of victims were appalled and he was quick to apologise. Then he made himself unpopular by saying that poor people should not have large families if they couldn't afford them. But last week he showed that he can bounce back, whatever rude names he gets called along the way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
