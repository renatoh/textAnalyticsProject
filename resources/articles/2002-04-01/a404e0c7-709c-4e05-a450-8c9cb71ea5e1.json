So the ease with which they took control here, despite losing Michael Bevan for a time with a wrist injury, was an ominous sign for Lancashire. Bevan, making a debut for his third county, had moved with typical efficiency to a 105-ball half century when he was struck by a rising delivery from Peter Martin, retiring hurt in the following over though he did return later only to be dismissed for 66. The Foxes sprinted on regardless, with Darren Stevens and Neil Burns sharing a 100 stand inside 18 overs for the fifth wicket as Lancashire's bowlers struggled on a flat, easy-paced early-season pitch. To make matters worse for Lancashire they had dropped both Stevens and Burns on 16 - Stevens a difficult caught-and-bowled to Glen Chapple, Burns sweeping Gary Keedy uppishly to square-leg only for the 18-year-old debutant Kyle Hogg to fumble. The beneficiaries reached their half-centuries from consecutive balls just before tea, Stevens from 78 balls with nine boundaries, and Burns in only 39. The 36-year-old wicketkeeper enjoyed a productive 2001 summer, one of six Leicestershire players who averaged over 40. But the scale of last winter's exodus from Grace Road was summed up by the fact that he was the only one of the six playing here. Bevan has been signed rather than Daniel Marsh or Shahid Afridi, last year's overseas players; Ben Smith and Aftab Habib have found richer counties, along with Jon Dakin and Jimmy Ormond; while Trevor Ward has the flu. Bevan, Rob Cunliffe and Charlie Dagnall have been brought in to plug some of the gaps, but Cunliffe did not last long on his debut, bowled off the inside-edge in Martin's third over. Darren Maddy, who is overdue a decent season, started badly with a loose drive at Mike Smethurst allowing Stuart Law to take a sharp catch at third slip. And when Law pouched another off Chapple to send back Iain Sutcliffe after a painstaking 27, Leicestershire were 65 for three. But their captain Vince Wells then joined Bevan and justified his decision to bat first. They put on 114 before Bevan was injured, with Wells moving on to 74 before Keedy had him taken by Byas: Lancashire bowled far too many four-balls. Hogg and Byas, 20 years apart, will so far have few happy memories of their championship debuts for Lancashire. Byas's first significant contribution was to drop Sutcliffe at first slip off Chapple. Bevan showed no respect for Hogg's pedigree - his father Willie was a popular Lancashire seamer, and he is the grandson of Sonny Ramadhin - by carving him for three consecutive boundaries through backward-point, the first off a long-hop but the other two off perfectly respectable balls. However at least Hogg experienced the joy of taking his first championship wicket off with the first ball after tea, as Warren Hegg dived forward to catch Burns's mishit pull. Caught Hegg bowled Hogg has a pleasing ring to it. But there was little else to cheer Lancashire's new captain yesterday. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
