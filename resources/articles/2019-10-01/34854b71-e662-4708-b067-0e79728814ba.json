The prime minister is expected to set out his long-awaited proposals for the Irish border in his speech at Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday, outlining what he will call \u201ca fair and reasonable compromise\u201d but warning that if the EU27 does not engage, he will press ahead with no deal. Johnson confirmed on Tuesday that his plans would include a customs border on the island of Ireland but insisted the proposals would show that the new regime of checks and controls would be light-touch. The plan would also involve Northern Ireland staying under EU single market regulations for agrifood and manufactured goods for four years, leaving it in a special relationship with the bloc until at least 2025. Stormont will at that point decide whether to continue alignment with EU standards on manufactured goods or follow UK rules as the country diverges. But the plans in which Northern Ireland would have two borders for a four-year period are set to receive a frosty welcome when they are formally published on Wednesday. If the UK had accepted the need for Northern Ireland to temporarily stay under both single market regulations and in a shared customs territory with the EU after Brexit, sources in Brussels disclosed to the Guardian that pressure might have been applied on Dublin to accept a time limit, an unthinkable concession just six months ago, and one yet to be discussed among the EU27. But officials and diplomats said the current \u201ckamikaze\u201d approach taken by Downing Street to the customs border offered no way forward and Johnson\u2019s hopes of finding an agreement would be swiftly dashed. \u201cI expect Mr Barnier [the EU chief negotiator] will make it clear very quickly that this does not stack up,\u201d said one EU diplomat. With little over two weeks before the crunch EU leaders\u2019 summit at which Johnson hopes to sign off on a deal, Downing Street is banking on then entering secretive \u201ctunnel\u201d negotiations to hammer out the details of an agreement. Johnson\u2019s predecessor at No 10, Theresa May, had secured an all-UK customs element to the backstop following such a period of talks in 2018, during which the European commission\u2019s negotiators took risks over the unity of the EU27 in order to find a deal that could be put to parliament. When that deal emerged from the secret talks, a number of member states, including France, were unhappy with the outcome but allowed it to pass, having been convinced it was the only deal the Commons could accept. But the UK\u2019s current direction of travel, including an insistence on the return of a customs border on the island of Ireland, offered little room for negotiation, EU diplomats said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a tunnel and I have never even seen the signs of heading to a tunnel,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cPlease put on your lights. I think it is a bit premature.\u201d Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Johnson denied reports that his first formal proposals to the EU would involve customs clearance sites five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports. The prime minister reiterated, however, that Northern Ireland could not be left in the EU\u2019s customs territory after Brexit and said it was simply a \u201creality\u201d that there would need to be extra checks and controls on the island of Ireland. Speaking in the Irish parliament, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, welcomed the fact that Johnson had \u201cdisowned\u201d the reported contents of the \u201cnon-papers\u201d discussion documents submitted by the UK to the European commission but fired a shot across the prime minister\u2019s bows. \u201cI\u2019m conscious when answering your question that I am talking about non-papers that I haven\u2019t seen,\u201d Varadkar told the Irish parliament. He added: \u201cI very much welcome Boris Johnson\u2019s words today when he disowned the non-papers. Had he not, in my view it would be hard evidence of bad faith by the UK government. \u201cThe UK government promised no hard border or associated controls or checks and we expect the British government to honour that promise made in the withdrawal agreement. People here don\u2019t want a customs border between north and south and no British government should seek to impose customs posts against the will of the people on the island of Ireland.\u201d The chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who is in the same party as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, tweeted: \u201cJohnson simply doesn\u2019t learn: his latest Brexit plans are not serious and violate the law. He wants to ask not to extend the deadline and proposes a backstop that de facto is a hard border. Not least to protect the sovereignty of parliament. EU should give a long extension.\u201d In a sign of widespread dismay at the British government\u2019s choices, France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome. He said: \u201cYou know France\u2019s position. It considers that the withdrawal agreement is the best solution. But today the most plausible scenario is an exit without a deal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
