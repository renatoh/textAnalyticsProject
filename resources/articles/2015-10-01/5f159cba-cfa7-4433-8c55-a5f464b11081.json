Created by Joseph McGlennon, the photograph is both \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cmysterious\u201d according to judges, who chose it ahead of 46 other finalists. \u201cJoseph brings the macrocosmic and microcosmic together masterfully in this landscape,\u201d said judge Stephen Zagala. \u201cIt fills us with a sense of wonder for what transpires beyond the contours of human hubris.\u201d McGlennon\u2019s elaborately constructed work, titled Florilegium #1, references the curiosity of early European settlers about Australia\u2019s native flora and fauna. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the work of [the botanist] Joseph Banks and his travels with James Cook,\u201d McGlennon told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe tried to put a book together called Florilegium, which in Latin means \u2018collecting botanicals\u2019, and I liked that thought. For me the image is about what [our planet is] losing, as much as it is about what exists.\u201d McGlennon\u2019s image is composed of \u201cprobably over 100 layers\u201d. He travelled the world to collect and shoot the visual components before spending several weeks arranging them to seductive effect in post-production. And while much of his photographic practice involves taxidermied animals, he says the parrots were \u201cvery much alive!\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a very utopian scene,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted it to be super-real; I wanted people to be entranced. On the Bowness Facebook page someone wrote a comment that says \u2018That can\u2019t be real?\u2019 I loved that because that means for a second they thought it was real.\u201d The 58-year-old ventured into fine-art photography following a career in branding and advertising. He was a finalist in the Bowness prize in 2012. His triumph this year earned him $25,000 in prize money. McGlennon\u2019s work beat competition from a diverse shortlist, including many landscapes and several images made using alternative or cameraless photographic techniques. His victory means that a more traditional landscape has yet to win the prestigious competition, which is now in its tenth year, although the judges noted the quality of the contenders in that genre and awarded secondary prizes to Peter Campbell, Daniel Shipp and Valerie Sparks. \u201cIt\u2019s been an impressive year for landscapes in the Bowness Photography prize, with all four winning photographs depicting some sense of scenery,\u201d said Kallie Blauhorn, director of the Monash Gallery of Art in Victoria, which hosts the prize. \u201cWhether it be utopian, dystopian, real or imagined, all these images are very technologically accomplished.\u201d \u2022 The Monash Gallery of Art will host the Bowness Photography prize exhibition until 22 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
