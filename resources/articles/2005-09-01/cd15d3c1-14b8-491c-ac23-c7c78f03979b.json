The bombs were made up of explosives surrounded by nails and stuffed into bottles. The discovery has made police question whether a fifth bomber was due to take part in the atrocity, but failed to show up. Scotland Yard gave details of the find as they released CCTV footage showing three of the four bombers carrying out a \"dry run\" a week before the attacks. The CCTV tapes show Germaine Lindsay, 19, Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, and Shehzad Tanweer, 22, on the morning of Tuesday June 28 at Luton station where they boarded a Thameslink train for London at 8.10am, arriving at King's Cross at 8.55am. The three men are pictured again at Baker Street underground station around midday, and back at King's Cross at 12.50pm, where they caught a train back to Luton, arriving at 1.40pm. \"The obvious implication is that they were conducting a reconnaissance,\" said Peter Clarke, the deputy assistant commissioner in charge of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch. Mr Clarke said he believed the \"dry run\" was to check timings and security and that the men were not carrying explosives. On July 7, Khan, Tanweer, and the fourth bomber 18-year-old Hasib Hussain, left Leeds at 4am and drove to Luton in a blue Nissan Micra. They arrived at the station car park at 6.51am to meet Lindsay, who had also driven there and had been waiting for them since 5am. The bombers then got the train from Luton to central London, arriving at King's Cross before boarding three tube trains and a bus where they set off the bombs they were carrying in rucksacks, killing themselves and 52 victims. The June 28 footage provides further evidence of the degree of sophistication and planning around the July 7 attacks, belying suggestions that the bombers were naive and did not understand the consequences of their actions. Khan left a suicide video, glorifying al-Qaida, but no suicide tape or note has been found from any of the other three. Although investigators said there was no firm evidence to date to indicate another bomber, a security source admitted there were concerns the four were part of a larger cell. \"Our big worry has always been that there might be others involved in this,\" said the source. The extra material found in the car suggested \"on the balance of probabilities\" that more people were involved, he added. Mr Clarke said a bag containing \"two viable devices\" was found under the front passenger seat of the Nissan Micra left by the bombers at Luton station on July 7. As well as the rucksack, 14 other bomb components were discovered in the car. Cool boxes, used to transport the highly volatile peroxide-based explosives, which detectives believe were mixed in a bath in a flat in Leeds, were also found in the boot. Mr Clarke said the expertise and care needed to make the devices, and the discovery of the \"bomb factory\" in the flat, also indicated meticulous planning. He said: \"It's difficult to say when the plans crystallised but I'd be surprised if there hadn't been some form of terrorist planning for many months. They [July 7 devices] appear to have been very effectively made. Whoever made them had done good research or been well-trained. It sounds a rather clinical assessment given the ghastly outcome but they were very efficient explosions with very little residue left behind.\" Mr Clarke said the Met now regarded Dr Magdi el-Nashar, an Egyptian-born biochemist with alleged links to the Leeds flat and questioned by the Egyptian authorities in Cairo as a witness, not a suspect. The three tube bombs exploded almost simultaneously at 8.50am, but Hussein's device went off almost an hour later at 9.47am on the number 30 bus in Tavistock Square. Detectives believe he may have targeted a bus because he was unable to get on a Northern line tube as planned as it had already shut due to the other bombs. He made several mobile calls outside King's Cross and police think he may first have boarded another bus toward Euston station but he got off and onto the number 30. Mr Clarke said the focus of the investigation was now on the much wider terrorism network thought to exist around the bombers. \"We need to find out who supported them, who encouraged them [the bombers], who knew what they were going to do,\" he said. International connections, such as Khan and Tanweer's trip to Pakistan in the November-February period before the bombings, were still being investigated. A mobile phone sim chip found on Tanweer's remains showed a list of numbers in Pakistan, resulting in dozens of arrests but failing to yield firm leads. Pakistani intelligence agents believe the pair had extensive contacts with extremist clerics and terrorist suspects. Train tickets and receipts found at addresses linked to the bombers led to the discovery that three of them had been on a \"dummy run\" on June 28. Officers had to trawl through 80,000 CCTV tapes. Mr Clarke described the CCTV clues alone as \"a complex jigsaw with 80,000 pieces\". Just one example of the inquiry's scale is the search of a vast landfill site - the size of 18 Olympic swimming pools - in West Yorkshire, where detectives think some of the bombers' rubbish was dumped. Police have also taken about 3,000 witness statements and searched 14 other locations, collecting 30,000 items as possible evidence in the investigation. Meanwhile Hussein Osman, the fourth suspected bomber in the planned July 21 attacks, was expected back in Britain today, Italian lawyers involved in the case said. Antonietta Sonnessa, who represented Osman, known in Italy as Hamdi Issac, was quoted as saying she had bid her client a \"calm farewell\". The final obstacle to her client's extradition was removed by a judge in Rome on Monday. Osman was expected to be returned to Britain, most likely on a military plane.
