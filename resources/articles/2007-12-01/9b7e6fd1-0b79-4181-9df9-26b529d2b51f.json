Spanish and cookery in Mexico A concentration challenge, learning Spanish almost next to the beach on the Yucatan peninsula, but this school - in an old colonial building in Playa del Carmen, a merciful 60km south of Cancun - keeps your nose to the grindstone in the morning before releasing you to cook and play in the afternoon. \u00b7 Caledonia Languages (+44 (0)131-621 7721, caledonialanguages.com) has one-week Spanish and cookery courses for \u00a3215, two-week courses cost \u00a3395."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
