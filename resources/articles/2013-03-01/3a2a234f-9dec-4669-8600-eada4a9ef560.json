Alan Knill brought Torquay United their second win in five days at Plainmoor when they beat York City 2-1 on Saturday as the scramble to stay in League Two grows ever more desperate. A week ago five clubs, including Torquay, were equal bottom on 40 points, with York on 41. Now York, with a newer but nominally more permanent manager in Nigel Worthington, are 23rd. Torquay engaged Knill last month after five successive defeats under Shaun Taylor, the first-team coach who himself was standing in for Martin Ling, absent on sick leave. The run extended to seven defeats \u2013 and 11 games without a win \u2013 before their victory over Chesterfield last Tuesday. Two away draws before that suggest Knill may have instilled the guts to survive. York looked short in that area. They have not won in 15 games, 11 under Gary Mills and now four under Worthington that have yielded one point. \"We need big characters to take responsibility and make things happen,\" he said. On New Year's Day, when they last won, they were 14th, six points from the play-off places and 12 from relegation, with Torquay 15th. Since then the Conference spectre has haunted both in their descent. Parachutes here come not in cash but mental strength. Both have been there, York escaping in May after eight seasons, Torquay in 2009 after two. Pity the Blue Square Premier, which in any sensible arrangement would be the fifth division instead of outer darkness. Half its clubs have been in the Football League this century. Blame the Premier League, whose omnipotence has crushed the Football League and a wealth (or perhaps poverty) of clubs that are heart and soul of the professional game with homegrown fanbases. Indeed the top few, with daily press conferences leading to a breakfast diet of puffed chaff, seem determined to deny the majority the oxygen of publicity. On Saturday they looked even to control the weather, thereby frustrating Leagues One and Two, but Torquay, with a local board of true fans who have invested generously, defied them and got their reward. It was almost a repeat of Tuesday's win. Elliot Benyon forced them ahead in a post-corner, pinball scramble and Ryan Jarvis, with a run and 25-yard shot after 23 minutes, made it comfortable until Josh Carson, a lively loanee from Ipswich, clear on goal, was brought down by Thomas Cruise \u2013 a red card for one, a penalty for Richard Cresswell, 20 minutes to go and regrets at 50 minutes' loss of focus. Chris Smith, York's captain and self-appointed man over, roared upfield from central defence. In the end the proof of the pudding \u2013 and the pitch was certainly that \u2013 lay in the beating, which Torquay duly delivered, but their fans were put through agonies of tension before the gulls swooped and squawked in celebration. And it could have been so different if York's Ashley Chambers had buried a header a minute after Benyon's opener. Both managers are targeting 50 points, more than enough most years, but Worthington had better get cracking. He enjoyed a good spell at Norwich but York appear to have been attracted by his five-match stint in 2007, when he kept Leicester City in the Championship. Perhaps, when there are only five games left, he will emerge from his dug-out. Knill visibly urged his men on with regular knee-bending. His appointment as manager is to the end of the season while Ling remains on the payroll as team manager. A year ago he took the club to the play-offs and they were almost living up to that until he succumbed to a stress-related illness. His popularity through the club is undimmed, though some fans prefer the current 4-4-2 to his 4-5-1. But until 27 April Torquay's motto is \"Knill desperandum\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
