The World Bank on Thursday adopted a plan to aid China with $1bn to $1.5bn in low-interest loans annually until 2025. The plan called for lending to \u201cgradually decline\u201d from the previous five-year average of $1.8bn. Trump tweeted on Friday night: \u201cWhy is the World Bank loaning money to China? Can this be possible? China has plenty of money, and if they don\u2019t, they create it. STOP!\u201d The president was reiterating a position long held by his administration, including David Malpass when he was a treasury department official before his election as the current head of the World Bank. Trump\u2019s message on the World Bank echoed his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who told a House of Representatives committee on Thursday that the US \u201chas objected\u201d to the institution\u2019s multi-year program of loans and projects in China. The World Bank loaned China $1.3bn in the fiscal 2019 year, which ended on 30 June, a decrease from about $2.4bn in fiscal 2017. But the fall in the World Bank\u2019s loans to China is not swift enough for the Trump administration, which has argued that Beijing is too wealthy for international aid. The program \u201creflects the evolution of our relationship with China\u201d Martin Raiser, the World Bank\u2019s China director, said on Thursday. \u201cOur engagement will be increasingly selective.\u201d The White House and the World Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Trump\u2019s remark. The past week has seen mounting concern that the US and China will not conclude an interim trade agreement before a new set of American tariffs hit Chinese goods on 15 December. Trump told a Nato summit that he was in no hurry to sign an agreement before US elections in November. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s better to wait until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now,\u201d he said, sparking heavy selling on global markets. The relationship between the superpowers has been further strained by US legislation that aims to tackle Beijing\u2019s repression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and human rights abuses in Hong Kong. On Friday, China\u2019s head of public security called for stronger cooperation with Hong Kong\u2019s police, as pro-democracy protesters vowed to hold another massive rally over the weekend. In a meeting with Hong Kong police chief Tang Ping-keung in Beijing, China\u2019s public security minister, Zhao Kezhi, said: \u201cThe central government and public security ministry will always be a strong backup force for the Hong Kong police force.\u201d At Friday\u2019s meeting, Tang thanked China\u2019s public security bureau for its \u201cvigorous support and help\u201d and told Zhao that the city\u2019s police force would \u201cthrow all of its energy\u201d into stopping violence and unrest in Hong Kong. The force\u2019s reputation has suffered during the protests, with many accusing officers of brutality. A new poll released on Friday by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme, which has tracked public sentiment for years, showed new record disapproval for the force with 40% of respondents now giving it the lowest mark of zero. Hong Kong has been battered by six months of often violent protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability in the most stark challenge the city has presented to Beijing since its 1997 handover.
