Glaxo has halted mid-stage tests in patients who have not taken Aids drugs before but late-stage trials in people who have taken other HIV drugs are continuing. \"We don't know whether the [problems] are drug related, but given the serious nature of the issue, we are halting the programme,\" a Glaxo spokesman said. The news puts the UK's largest drugs firm further behind its US rival Pfizer in the race to develop the Aids treatments, known as CCR5 inhibitors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
