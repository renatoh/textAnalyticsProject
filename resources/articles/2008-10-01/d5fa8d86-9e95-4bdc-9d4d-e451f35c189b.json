If its success were measured in published words alone, the Trust would be considered a triumph. The structure, agreed two years ago in the wake of the Hutton report which discredited the BBC governors, offers a perpetual system of benchmarking, reviews and research. But despite the Trustees in general being of higher calibre than the governors they replaced, and having access to a slew of expensive research and consultants as well as their own staff, they have come under fire for their conclusions. What are its successes? The way it dealt with the crises over editorial deception and faked competitions last year, although it is arguable that at least as much credit should go to the BBC management and Ofcom. Its considered verdict on the complex questions surrounding the iPlayer also showed how it could work to the benefit of both the BBC and the market, save for one crucial mistake - it banned the corporation from opening up the iPlayer to other broadcasters. And its failures? A series of high-profile reviews that critics claim have failed to hold management to account. The BBC's new media operation was found to have overspent by \u00a336m yet a huge budget increase for the following year was approved, a high-profile investigation into salaries came to the conclusion that the BBC didn't distort the market, and new services including high-definition TV channels were waved through. What's the verdict on Sir Michael Lyons? A sure-footed, if low-profile, start appeared to be undermined when he went on the offensive over the prospect of top-slicing. Dismissing Channel 4's call for public funding and calling for a wider debate, while at the same time arguing the BBC should be kept out of it, seemed a tactical error. And for an organisation that is supposed to represent licence fee payers, Lyons has remained beneath the radar. Is their role sufficiently clear? No, the old question - are they cheerleader or regulator or both? - persists. When the BBC management and Trust submitted a joint response to the Ofcom public service broadcasting consultation, not only did it remove any pretence of separation but it reinforced the perception among some critics that the latter was being used as a tool by the former. What are the alternatives? Ofcom professes not to want oversight of the BBC but the current halfway house arrangement seems doomed to attract continued controversy. A new public service authority is one possible solution, but it would be bitterly resisted by the BBC. The Trust has been neither unmitigated disaster nor unalloyed triumph - the jury is still out and fundamental questions about its purpose remain. As one senior industry figure remarked on its formation: \"This is a fudge. What we don't know is whether it's a fudge that will work.\" That remains as true today as it did two years ago when it officially came into being."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
