On Friday evening, Bruce and I smartened ourselves up to go to a concert in KL with Feliz. This was the third outing for my one dress. I even used Feliz's local knowledge to have an overdue haircut, an experience that included a 15 minute vigorous head massage that left the scalp tingling - if somewhat sore. It was an interesting evening with an audience of mixed ages and ethnic backgrounds. I met a local writer, an artist and a film producer or two. The music was good with Feliz's friend Mike from Texas singing and playing a mean piano; there were also two very good local singer/songwriters on guitar. A plentiful supply of wine added to a very enjoyable evening, and when we got back Feliz showed me the Radio Four website, where you can catch the Archers live, if you're prepared to wait until three in the morning. So after only three hours sleep, it was up bright and early to head off for Taman Negara National Park. It was also goodbye to Feliz who has been a brilliant host - she faces an uncertain future, not sure if she can stay in Malaysia. Good luck Feliz, and I hope it all works out as you would wish. I hope you aren't all muttering 'not another rainforest' - I promise this is the last for a while. Taman Negara is the largest, the oldest and the most commercial of Malaysia's national parks. The privately owned resort is very smart and very expensive, but the other side of the river has cheap accomodation and some excellent floating restaurants. I met up with Mary, an American environmentalist, and we did the long canopy walk, swaying up among the treetops, which was good fun, and carried on for a further five hour walk. That night I found myself the only person in a block of three, five-bed dorms. This wasn't a problem until I discovered that the windows did not shut and the handle of the door was broken. On tackling the lady in charge she dismissed this saying that she was on the premises 24 hours a day. That night I slept cuddling my bag of valuables and my torch. Amazingly I woke 11 hours later from a deep dreamless sleep, missing Mary's attempt to find me for a rubber tube ride over the rapids. In the afternoon we took a wonderful boat ride down a side river with crystal clear water and a canopy of jungle, spotting many kingfishers, an eagle, huge monitor lizards and a couple of monkeys. There were lots of hornbills flying overhead but we didn't get to see one close up. On Tuesday I returned to KL with Mary to find accomodation. We had picked a place out of the book, but couldn't find it anywhere. The taxi driver lost patience and dumped us but we still couldn't find it on foot. In desperation we booked in to the nearest decent looking hotel which turned out to be very luxurious - and very expensive. Mary was off back to the States early next morning. I could not face the thought of moving again and leaving those fluffy white towels, hot water, TV, and very comfy bed and stayed on. A body can only take so much roughing it - economy drive next week. Wednesday, having sampled Chinese-style body piercing in Kuching, it seemed appropriate to go to the Hindu Thaipusam festival in KL. Hindus flock in their thousands to the Batu caves to celebrate the festival in honour of Lord Murugu, the six-faced god. Devotees - men, women and children dressed in saffron, often with their heads shaved, carrying jars of milk and limes - queue to go up the 272 steps to the temple inside the cave to offer penance, or thanks for blessings received. Most spectacular are the 'vel kavardis' - large, metal, cage-like constructions decorated with pictures of the gods and peacock feathers, carried on the shoulders of the men and attached to their bodies by metal hooks in the skin. They also have an assortment of hooks and rods through their faces and tongues. I have never seen anything like the spectacle of them all queueing to go up the steps, fired on by the constant chanting and beating of drums. I was content to watch until spotted by Jit, a young Malaysian I had met at Feliz's who persuaded me to join the procession up the steps to the temple. This meant being part of the vast human press of sweating, heaving bodies, avoiding the litter of lost sandles, empty water bottles and the occasional person who had fainted and was being carried away by the plentiful first aiders. Once on the stairway it was OK and was worth the effort to see the temple inside the huge caves. Here, the goal reached, the offerings were made and the cages removed. People were quiet, occasionally in trance or complete exhaustion, some enjoying the irreverent monkeys leaping on the many statues high in the walls. The whole morning was a memorable and exciting experience, marred only by the personal moments of near panic when the crowd started pushing. Back down again I felt exhausted, had had enough and headed back to KL. A very late lunch, a few iced drinks and I felt revived enough to visit Central Market, full of local art work and touristy gifts. Here there was a festival of fortune telling and, in a manner reminiscent of being henna'd in India, I somehow found myself in the booth of MD. Har Chao Wah, a woman specialising in geomancy and palmistry. Here we go - I was born in the year of the ox and am metal, which means I lack water, I am therefore not very good at looking after my inner self and spend all my money. This and other bits relating to my character and past were pretty accurate. 1998, 99 and 2000 were not good years (I would dispute 2000) and Aug, Sept and Dec are my best months. I will find love, happiness and money from 2003 onward. She ignored my request that it be a bit sooner, please. I get easily tired, will have trouble with my heart or breathing, should eat more fruit and veg, need to put on a bit of weight but will live into my 80's. I am creative and should try writing. Well - not bad, I suppose. I will leave it to you to deduce how much she could guess by the fact that I was wandering about on my own, was very tired from the morning at the festival, had a quick ciggie before I went in, do not have a wedding ring and chose the cheapest option available. Having just started to read Tiziano Terzani's A Fortune Teller Told Me, I am only relieved that she didn't tell me that I shouldn't fly. The next day I decided to take all the email advice and try a little island/beach life and set off to Pulau Pangkot. I am now in Teluk Nipah, which has two streets, lots of beach and one net caf\u00e9. Since we arrived I have twice bumped into a Canadian couple I'd already met on the bus, once to eat a delicious Indonesian meal. When I have finished this I might hire a bike and explore. Alternatively I might just look after my inner and outer self and relax on my veranda and read. Tomorrow it's back to KL to meet my sister and her husband, which will be good. Talking of family, I heard from my son Ben this week. He has finally finished 'resting' and has got a job teaching English in Japan for a year and goes in March. Pleased as I am, this means that I will not see him for yet another 13 months. Any chance of sneaking in an extra flight to Japan in April...? Bye until next week - I will be revisiting all the tips on Bali before I arrive next Saturday. It's a hard life!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
