Leicester have averaged only 42% possession this season, lower than any champions in the Premier League era, and they also rank low for other metrics including pass completion. But the Italian said anyone who uses those statistics to question the quality of the Premier League leaders is looking at the wrong figures. \u201cFootball is open, it is not only keeping possession of the ball and making more passes,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cWe make so many mistakes because we play at 100mph and it is difficult to play at 100mph. You can make mistakes. It\u2019s not important how many mistakes you make, it\u2019s about how many chances you create and how many goals you score. That is my philosophy.\u201d Leicester\u2019s ability to use players such as Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez to spring forward with lightning pace has flummoxed most defences and is the chief reason why they have scored 54 goals in 31 Premier League matches \u2013 more than anyone except Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 and gathered more points than everyone else. Their position at the top of the table is a persuasive endorsement of Ranieri\u2019s contention that Leicester\u2019s style is the one that best suits their players and least suits their opponents. To Ranieri, that is the key to successful management. \u201cWhat is important is to find the best solution for your players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to understand what your team can do.\u201d One of the most dynamic players in Leicester\u2019s team is the midfielder N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has made such an impact since joining from Caen last summer that he was called into the France squad last month and made a scoring international debut in his country\u2019s 4-2 victory over Russia on Tuesday. Kant\u00e9\u2019s performances have also earned admiration from Europe\u2019s top clubs and the player hinted in an interview while away on international duty that he might be open to a transfer in the summer. Ranieri does not believe the midfielder wants to leave but suggested he would not stand in his way if he were determined to go. \u201cHe should rest here,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe is working very well. But if some big teams come in for him, who give us a lot of big money, maybe we can think about it. If he is not happy here and wants to go \u2026 I don\u2019t want sad people here. I want happy people.\u201d Asked whether Kant\u00e9 seemed sad, the manager replied: \u201cNo. He is always smiling. It\u2019s just speculation.\u201d Beyond individual players, the club as a whole is enjoying new status, as reflected by the invitation to participate in a friendly tournament in August \u2013 the International Champions Cup \u2013 against Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Celtic. Ranieri said that fraternising with such illustrious names would help Leicester\u2019s players prepare for next season\u2019s European campaign. \u201cIt is important because we are in Europe now and are fighting to get there through the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cI want their minds open because not many players have played in Europe against the big teams. It is important to start thinking like a big team, a big club.\u201d But not too big. Ranieri warned that if any of his players showed signs of becoming arrogant or complacent after this season, he would administer emphatic attitude adjustment. \u201cIf they change, I will take the hammer and break their heads,\u201d the 64-year-old said with a smile before clarifying: \u201cChange, yes, but change for the better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
