With backbench MPs voicing concern about the ability of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to cope with the crisis, a former government vet who helped to deal with the last outbreak in 1967 called for a radical reappraisal of tactics. Ken Tyrell said that the stockpile of 41,000 carcasses awaiting incineration could be spreading airborne infection and called for ministers urgently to consider burial as a better alternative - although the National Farmers' Union said the revised policy of sending animals to a rendering plant at Widnes was a far safer option. At the same time, a former chief economist at the National Farmers' Union argued that the government might soon have to consider reopening tracts of the countryside to prevent a collapse of the rural economy. Sean Ricard, now a university lecturer, said ministers were in danger of overplaying an outbreak which in reality was directly affecting only a tiny sector of the British economy. But while the prime minister met the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, to assess the crisis as the number of cases approached 200 and with little sign of the epidemic peaking, Mr Brown insisted: \"We have got it curtailed. Our problem is that we can't predict where the disease, which is already incubating, is going to emerge, nor do we know how much of it that there is.\" He defended the policy of effectively closing down the countryside, to prevent the spread of the disease, on the grounds that it was halting the movement of animals \"that carry the infectivity and are most vulnerable to it\". But Mr Tyrell, 35 years with Maff, led a growing chorus of experts and MPs questioning ministry tactics, arguing that dead animals left outside for days were still covered with the foot and mouth virus, despite being disinfected. \"Why aren't we burying?\" he asked. \"It is the fastest, quickest, most expedient and cheapest way of getting rid of them - put them underground where they can't do any more damage.\" Asked on BBC radio whether the government should opt for a different approach, such as mass vaccination of animals, he added: \"I would certainly hope the ministry has ... dusted down its vaccination plans. But that is a major undertaking because there aren't the staff to do it.\" Some backbench MPs, including those supportive of Mr Brown, believe the crisis has been mishandled because of staff shortages at Maff. There has been a sharp cut in the number of ministry vets over the past 10 years, forcing the government to import over 200 vets from as far away as New Zealand. Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, whose constituency includes Heddon on the Wall, where the outbreak almost certainly began, said last night that an element of panic was now afflicting Maff, with a monitoring system weighed down by bureaucracy. Maff has not been helped in the run-up to the outbreak by scores of sheep being transported around the country without proper records. This has made tracing some animals almost impossible. Ben Gill, president of the NFU, said: \"We do know that the movement restrictions have curtailed any potential contagion around the country, but we still do not know at this stage where exactly the sheep that were moved from the infected markets went.\" While the NFU is careful not to criticise Maff - Mr Gill meets the agriculture secretary most days - its former chief economist argued that the outbreak, while painful for farmers whose livestock was being destroyed, was far from a national emergency. Mr Ricard recalled that in 1967 up to 80 cases a day, involving high value cattle, were being reported. Now a majority of the infected animals were sheep. \"The highest number of daily cases so far this time was 25 on Sunday and we really ought to keep this in perspective and realise we really are talking about a very small fraction of our economy,\" he said.
