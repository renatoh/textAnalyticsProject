Living as I do in one of the grimier holes of north-ish London, I'm forever looking up to Hampstead - literally - like a Dickensian urchin with his nose pressed against the window of a smart and glittery sweet shop. Oh, 'ow the 'uvver 'arf lives. Well, Gospel Oak, being just round the corner, has most of the benefits but is half the price, what with there being rather a few council estates what frighten the nobs away. True, you still have to actually walk up the hill to the top of Hampstead Heath rather than have it delivered to your door on the level for a million squid more. But the upside is that you don't get Hampstead's noisome posh oiks walking past your door, braying. The case against There are rather a lot of estates. Many pretty edgy for the uninitiated. Slightly ill-defined: left off most people's list of more desirable Hampstead satellites: Tufnell Park, Dartmouth Park and Kentish Town. Well connected? Gospel Oak and Hampstead Heath rail stations are on the mysterious, glorious Silverlink North London Line, one of the few public transport services that goes around London rather than in and out: connects you east to Highbury &amp; Islington tube and Hackney, and west to Kilburn and Chiswick. North and south more problematic: the tube is a fair walk to Chalk Farm, Kentish Town and Tufnell Park on the Northern Line. Decent buses north and south, though. Schools Fleet Primary \"very good\", says Ofsted, and Gospel Oak Primary \"highly inclusive and successful\". Secondaries: Parliament Hill and Haverstock both \"good\". Hang out at... M&amp;S on South End Green, pretending you live in Hampstead proper. Where to buy Poshest are the rack of roads between Mansfield Road and Parliament Hill: imposing terraces all. Oak Village just south has more period terraces saved from the Blitz/wrecking ball. Do not, I implore you, discount the council estates: there are some of the best designed in London around here; check out the Dunboyne Road Estate, for instance. Market values... Good for north London, but not cheap. Start at \u00a3180,000 for a one-bed ex-council; from \u00a3220,000 for two beds; from \u00a3250,000 for three. Flats in a period house conversion are pricier: one...#8209;beds from \u00a3250,000, two- from \u00a3320,000. Whole houses are rare and go fast: expect \u00a3500,000 plus for a two- to three-bed terrace, then up, up, up. Bargain of the week Nice-looking one-bedroom converted second-floor flat on Queens Crescent, for \u00a3205,000 with Oliver's (020-7284 1222). From the streets of Gospel Oak Marcel Rohe \"Magnificent for green space and sports facilities. Parliament Hill's right above you for kite-flying and, at the bottom, the glorious Parliament Hill Lido for sunbathing in summer: more 'real' than the Hampstead Ponds with all their glitterati.\" Mandy Pullman \"Because it's a sort of urban leftover, you get all sorts of people living here, rather than a ghetto of the rich or poor. Plenty of whippersnappers and students, too, and a strong community spirit.\" Pip Sandall \"Queens Crescent: one of the last old-style market streets left in north London, where you can pick up a million lighters for a quid, or great - and cheap - fruit and veg. Thursdays and Saturdays.\" Share your knowledge of your area - its highs and lows, up-and-coming streets or neighbourhoods, good schools, shops, places to hang out and tips for newcomers.
