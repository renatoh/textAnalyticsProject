On each occasion, at least one reader has complained that The Guardian, as a paper that proudly promotes progressive views, should not provide a platform for conservatives such as me, and that I should be banished to right-wing bastions such as The Australian. I usually have two responses to such comments. Firstly, as the holder of only moderately right-wing views, it\u2019s unlikely The Australian would ever publish my work. Secondly, open-mindedness is a characteristic of progressive politics and publishing a range of voices on a variety of issues, including mine, matters for public debate. Other forward-thinking media organisations strive to do the same, but all have difficulty identifying moderately conservative writers and bloggers. While some of my left-of-centre blogging colleagues bemoan the lack of extreme (and effective) advocates like Andrew Bolt and Alan Jones for the progressive side of politics, I\u2019ve often lamented the lack of moderate voices for the right. Australian political debate, particularly online, benefits from a rich variety of progressive views and I personally have learned \u2013 I\u2019d even venture to say I\u2019ve politically evolved \u2013 by observing and reading the discussions, debates and writing of people with those views. There is no equivalent of that nuanced debate on the right side of politics. This is more than a product of moderate voices being silenced or driven out of the Liberal party; it\u2019s much broader than that. As evidenced by the readers commenting on my articles, we\u2019re now at the stage where anyone who leans politically to the right seems to be tarred with the same brush as Cory Bernardi. Yet we Tories, conservatives, right-wingers or whatever you want to call us have a broad and rich range of opinions too. We are distinguished by believing in the importance of the individual, but not all support unfettered free trade or speech. We believe in capitalism and the right to profit from one\u2019s endeavours, yet some also believe that those who can pay should, whether it is for education, health or some other user-pays system. We support small government, but many of us still want the government to provide a safety net and assist those in need. And we want regulatory reform to reduce red tape but many also think some regulation is needed to deal with businesses which won\u2019t be responsible if left to their own devices. To broaden the political debate and show that there\u2019s more to the right than the Australian equivalent of the Tea Party, a few of us have collaborated on a blog called The Other Right to feature the work of writers and bloggers whose right-wing views are closer to the centre of the political spectrum. Only a handful of writers and bloggers are featured at The Other Right so far, and regular readers of Comment is Free will likely recognise a number of them. Over time we hope that other writers and bloggers of the same political persuasion will join us. We hope visitors to the blog will take away an understanding that the right\u2019s views are diverse, nuanced and sometimes not that dissimilar to others with different political philosophies. We hope editors will visit The Other Right to identify talented writers and commission new work from them. And by showing the variety and depth of moderate views on the right side of the political spectrum, we hope to add a dimension to Australia\u2019s political debate that is sorely missing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
