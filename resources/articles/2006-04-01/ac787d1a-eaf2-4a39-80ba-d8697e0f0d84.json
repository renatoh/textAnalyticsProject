If the notion did not come to the 35-year-old spinner in pre-season it will have arrived yesterday as he watched newly promoted Durham make the third highest score in their history, with Gordon Muchall making a career-best 219 and Phil Mustard a maiden first-class century. This is to take nothing away from Durham's splendid effort in their first match in the top division for six years. But the sight of two change bowlers, Neil Dexter and Darren Stevens, operating in tandem while Muchall and Mustard added 249, a record for the club's sixth wicket, would not worry many at this level. These are early days, of course, and reinforcements are on the way. But Justin Kemp is unlikely to invigorate their attack, assuming he is fit enough to bowl when he arrives next week. And though Andrew Hall's aggression will get him wickets, there must be considerable doubt that Martin Saggers, at almost 34, will regain the nippy outswingers that made him an England Test player two years ago; he played only eight games last year. Kent still have the batting to place opponents under pressure if they win the toss and bat first but, when they lose it on pitches as flat as this, they might struggle. Durham, though, were terrific. They resumed on 401 for five and Muchall soon pulled Robbie Joseph for six before pushing a single to reach his double hundred. He was sixth out, for 219, when he flat-batted a Dexter long-hop to Robert Key at cover with the score on 482. Mustard, though, flailed on, scoring another 63 from 72 balls before he launched Joseph into the safe hands of Stevens at long-on. Kent must have thought it was over but Ottis Gibson hit three sixes in a 33-ball 33 before Durham were bowled out for 575, setting Kent 426 to avoid the follow-on. Their opening partnership of Key and David Fulton looks less Laurel and Hardy than Laurel and Laurel, as the new captain Key has lost the best part of two stone. But his fitness could not save him from a good delivery from Neil Killeen that nipped away from his push. Fulton scored a dogged 62 before Dale Benkenstein found his edge with a leaving lifter. And Kent were in some trouble when Martin van Jaarsveld retired hurt with a hamstring problem at 137."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
