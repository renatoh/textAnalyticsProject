But it still comes as a surprise to hear the goalkeeper announce that, had he not made a success of football, he would probably be in the army. As Niemi prepares for an FA Cup semi-final against Watford which he describes as the biggest club game of his life, he has brought new meaning to the idea of indulging in fighting talk before kick-off. The Finn is no stranger to live ammunition or battle fatigues, having completed compulsory military service in his homeland. He found life tough for much of his 11 months at a sports military school but feels it is the career on which he would have fallen back. \"I didn't realise this at the time but, if I wasn't in football, I would probably be in the army,\" he says. \"I'm very patriotic. It was fun and it's something I would have considered, although I'm too old now. \"In some ways it's similar to what we have in the dressing room: being together and having fun, giving stick and taking stick. In the army it was a similar situation. We had something like 20 footballers in there and it was fun. Not at the time but looking back.\" At 6ft 1in and 14 stone of muscle, Niemi would hardly need a weapon to settle most arguments, and those joining the Finnish army these days stand little chance of ending up in combat. The last time his country fought was during the second world war. \"It's different from the UK,\" says Niemi. \"Obviously here you have to go to Iraq and places like that. In Finland you don't send troops to any combat. If somebody comes to Finland that's different but I think the only time they go abroad is for peace-keeping and stuff like that.\" Niemi has forged his career abroad in goalkeeping instead. The \u00a32m Southampton paid Hearts last August looks well spent, with the 30-year-old in such fine form that he has arguably not cost his team a point. Blackburn's Brad Friedel is one of the few keepers who could claim comparative consistency. It helps that Niemi has a temperament a soldier would admire. Niemi acts as if he has never heard of tension and makes clear he never feels nervous before matches. Even as he pulls on his gloves before tomorrow's semi-final he will feel little different from the days when he practised as a child in Oulu, the northern Finnish city where there is no darkness during summer nights but where Niemi can recall going to school in -42C one winter. \"I enjoy playing,\" he says. \"I have thought about it many times: would I be a better goalkeeper if I had [a different] attitude before games? But I think it's one of my strengths that I can relax during a game, no matter who we are playing, how big the stadium is, how many people are watching. I don't mind, I just enjoy it.\" Nor is it a coincidence, he suggests, that a small country such as Finland has two other Premiership keepers in Bolton's Jussi Jaaskelainen and Aston Villa's Peter Enckelman. \"I think the Scandinavian type is good for goalkeepers,\" he adds. \"They have a good physique and are calm.\" So does anything get Niemi wound up? \"All sorts of things,\" he says, \"not in football but in normal life. Child abuse, animal cruelty, that sort of thing. But in football I rarely get angry about anything.\" He is, though, getting excited about tomorrow. Niemi's first football memories are of watching FA Cup finals on a black and white television. The sport was not big in Finland then but the Cup final was always broadcast. Niemi has played in Europe for Rangers and Hearts and in an Old Firm match but insists none of that compares with this weekend's fare at Villa Park. \"This is easily the biggest and most important club game I will have played in,\" he says. \"I have been lucky to play in some big games but this is something different. \"The Old Firm game we lost 5-1, so it's not a good memory for me, and I only played in one. The Old Firm game is massive but there are four of them at least in the season, whereas with FA Cup semi- finals you are lucky if you play one in 10 years.\" Niemi had a frustrating time at Rangers, ending up down the pecking order after choosing Ibrox in favour of Gordon Strachan's Coventry. Five years later Strachan lured him to Southampton, with Niemi unable to resist the call of the Premiership this time. \"He's a perfect manager for this group because we don't have any star players,\" says Niemi of Strachan. \"We have some good footballers but nothing like some other clubs. When it's like that, you need a manager who gets 100% out of the players every match.\" Strachan demonstrated his belief in Niemi last December by instantly recalling him after injury to replace Paul Jones, who had been outstanding against Newcastle in the previous match. Little wonder Niemi calls Southampton the \"perfect club\" for him at the moment and has no regrets about leaving Hearts, much as he enjoyed living and playing in Edinburgh. \"The Premiership has been every bit as good as I expected and even more,\" he says. \"Everywhere you go it's a full stadium and the pitches are perfect. It's a fantastic league. \"I was making some good saves in Scottish football but the spotlight in the Premiership is so much bigger. There are so many cameras and every single game and situation is highlighted, so it's easier to shine. \"My decision to move was purely on a football basis. I hardly get any more money than I did in Scotland. I was there for five years and for two and half years I was playing regularly. Sometimes I felt I was playing against the same teams and the same players the whole time.\" Watford tomorrow is a whole new challenge. Niemi, albeit without the rifle, cannot wait for battle to commence. TV: Sky Sports 1, tomorrow, 4pm; kick-off, 4.30"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
