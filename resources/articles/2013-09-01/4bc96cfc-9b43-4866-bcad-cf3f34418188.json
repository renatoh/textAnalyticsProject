It's also popular among beach walkers and kite flyers, thanks to its length. The serene views extend from lobster boats bobbing in the waters of Kettle Cove to Richmond Island, a 200-acre private preserve just offshore. Elevate the views and escape mundane snack-bar fare by putting on shirts and sandals and walking up the boardwalk to the Inn by the Sea for lunch, perhaps lobster rolls, on the deck. \u2022 Route 77, Cape Elizabeth, +1 207 767 3625, parksandlands.com Long Sands beach, York Look out to the Nubble Light from Long Sands Beach, a 2.4km swath of sand. Like most Maine beaches, it is grand at low tide, but at high tide, it shrinks to a sliver. When the tide's out, Long Sands is a playground for castle builders, kite flyers, and frisbee and ball games; when it turns, the waves attract surfers. Backing the beach is a street lined with lodgings, restaurants and shops, handy for grabbing lunch or beach toys. Bring quarters: metered street parking is 25\u00a2 an hour. Afterwards, visit the lighthouse and get ice-cream at Brown's. \u2022 Route 1A, York Beach, +1 207 363 4422, gatewaytomaine.org Ogunquit beach, Ogunquit Credit Maine's indigenous Abenaki people for naming Ogunquit, which translates as \"beautiful place by the sea\", and the late 19th-century artists' colony for sharing with the world the 3.5 mile-long beach fringed with sea grass and dunes. When the tide recedes, it goes way out, leaving pocket pools, shallow waters and sandbars. When it rises, be careful of strong currents created by the tidal river behind the beach. Check a tidal chart before visiting: at high tide, the beach all but disappears. Even during the busy peak season, it's possible to find space by walking north from the Main Beach crowds. \u2022 Beach Street, Ogunquit, +1 207 646 2939, ogunquit.org Laudholm beach, Wells You'll have to hike to this relatively isolated section of beach that's part of the Wells national estuarine research reserve at Laudholm. Pick up a trail map at the visitor centre, in a former 19th-century farmhouse. The easy 1.5km Barrier Beach trail passes by a maple swamp and marsh before reaching the dune-backed powdery sands of Laudholm, the least busy of Wells's beaches. Once on the sands, turn north and continue to the mouth of the Little river to view the barrier beaches and the adjacent Rachel Carson national wildlife reserve. Bring binoculars for birdwatching. \u2022 324 Laudholm Farm Road, off Route 1, Wells, +1 207 646 1555, wellsreserve.org Goose Rocks beach, Kennebunkport Let's get the cons out of the way: parking is extremely limited and a permit is required (available at the General Store), some local property owners can be downright nasty, and there are no facilities other than a portable toilet. So why go? Goose Rocks is lovely, a three-mile strand backed by dunes. At low tide, comb the beach for sand dollars and other gifts from the sea. Bring binoculars to watch for seals sunbathing on the offshore rocks. One of the best ways to enjoy this beach is with a cocktail in hand on the porch of the Tides Beach Club, especially at sunset. \u2022 King's Highway, off Route 1, Kennebunkport, +1 207 967 0857, visitthekennebunks.com Old Orchard beach, Old Orchard Yes it's crowded, but fans of 11.2km-long Old Orchard beach would have it no other way. Quiet sands \u2013 including Scarborough's Pine Point and Saco's Camp Ellis \u2013 fringe the outskirts, but Old Orchard is famed for its beachside amusement park and historic pier. Go for the sand and the people-watching. Breathe in the scents of pizza, fried dough and French fries. Listen to the French-Canadian accents riding on the breeze. Ride the ferris wheel, carousel and rollercoasters, and stroll along the pier. Be prepared for the pay for toilets (50\u00a2) and be warned that the bars can get raucous at night. \u2022 Grand Avenue/Route 9, Old Orchard Beach, +1 207 934 2500, oldorchardbeachmaine.com Scarborough beach state park, Scarborough American master Winslow Homer painted many of his iconic works from his studio on Prouts Neck, a granite-tipped finger of land reaching seaward just south of Portland. Also here is Scarborough beach, a long, wide, dune-backed sand swath. Facilities include the Shack, which sells food and rents chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards. If you plan to brave the chilly waters, do so in the designated lifeguard area, as rip currents sometimes occur. Between the parking lot and the beach is Massacre Pond, site of a 1703 skirmish between indigenous residents and wannabe settlers; of 21 settlers, 20 were slain. \u2022 418 Blackpoint Road, Scarborough, +1 207 883 2416, scarboroughbeachstatepark.com Popham beach state park, Phippsburg Mother Nature hasn't been kind to Popham, at the mouth of the Kennebec River and near the site of a short-lived 1607 British settlement and a fort dating from 1861. Storms have eroded the dunes and reduced the beach to a shadow at high tide but, at low tide, when you can walk for miles in the sand, it's a gem. Check the tide times if you're planning to walk out on the sandbar to rocky Fox Island, one of two nearby islands, or risk being marooned. Further offshore is Seguin Island lighthouse. There are toilets, but no food service. \u2022 10 Perkins Farm Lane, off Route 209, Phippsburg, +1 207 389 1335, visitmaine.com Reid State Park, Georgetown It's worth the long drive down the Georgetown peninsula, just north of Bath, to find this nature-lovers' dream with sandy beaches, salt marshes, grassy dunes, a tidal river, a lagoon and rocky headlands. Search for sand dollars along the Mile and Half Mile beaches; pad up Griffith Head for sweeping views of the island-studded seascape; seek treasures in the tidal pools; scan the skies for bald eagles and ospreys. There are toilets and picnic tables, but no food service, so plan to end the day at nearby Five Islands Lobster Co, one of Maine's best and most scenic lobster shacks. \u2022 375 Seguinland Road, Georgetown, +1 207 371 2303, visitmaine.com Sand Beach, Acadia national park Sand Beach is one of the prizes of Acadia national park. This pocket beach, edging a cove between Great Head and Gorham Mountain, is remarkable not only for its rare existence on Maine's craggy coastline, but also for its pink sands, comprising zillions of pulverised shells. Go for the mesmerising scenery, enrol kids in the park's Super Sand Sleuths programme, clamber over the boulders, wade in the stream, hike Great Head for the views, but don't plan on swimming: the water temperature rarely exceeds 13C. Avoid the crowds by visiting before 10am or after 2pm. \u2022 Off Park Loop Road, Bar Harbor, +1 207 288 3338, nps.gov/acad Maine-based Hilary Nangle is the author of three Moon-series guidebooks: Moon Maine, Moon Coastal Maine, and Moon Acadia National Park.
