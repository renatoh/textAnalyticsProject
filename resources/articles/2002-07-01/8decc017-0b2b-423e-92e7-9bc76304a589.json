And in a strongly worded statement yesterday the county in effect told any dissident players: \"Go if you don't want to play for us.\" It has been suggested that five or six players are unsettled. Jeremy Snape, Kim Barnett, Martyn Ball and Mark Hardinges are among those believed to be considering their futures. The overseas player Ian Harvey has not committed himself to the county for next year. The statement referred to speculation about \"so-called dressing room unrest\". It said: \"The management committee are giving their complete backing to John Bracewell and Mark Alleyne. During their time ... Gloucestershire have achieved unprecedented success and now the county are confident that the recent problems will be dealt with appropriately.\" Tom Richardson, the chief executive, later said: \"It's quite clear to us that we can't run a club with a gun held to our heads. We recognise we may have got some things wrong and are now putting them right. \"But, if there are individuals who feel they don't want to stay with us under the present management team, then they will have to go. If there are a few casualties, so be it.\" The county's robust public response, aimed specifically at the rebels, will heighten the impasse and almost certainly lead to several experienced players moving to other counties. Bristol-based supporters hope Ball, now in his benefit season and very much a local boy, will not be among them. Bracewell, privately upset at the personal criticism levelled at him and the leaked rumours of dissent, said: \"We have gained success in the past from being a total team. We aren't a high-budget club, though collectively I'm sure we're still capable of renewed success. \"As a manager you are particularly exposed and it can be quite a vicious world outside. I see as part of my job to deflect any of the criticism directed at the captain.\" Commenting on grumbles about Gloucestershire's poor four-day record, Bracewell added: \"We are still only halfway through the season.\" Richardson said: \"Every playing member of the club has been interviewed. Contract discussions and personal attitudes could possibly affect team selection during the remaining fixtures. I don't believe dissatisfaction is as widespread as some would have us think.\" Muttiah Muralitharan completed another 10-wicket match haul yesterday as Sri Lanka crushed Bangladesh in the first Test by an innings and 196 runs within three days in Colombo. The off-spinner, just back from a serious shoulder injury, took five for 59 from 25 overs in the second innings as the tourists were dismissed for 184. It is the 11th time Muralitharan has taken 10 wickets in a match and gives him a career total of 430 wickets, fifth on the all-time list. His display, earning him 10 for 98, also gave him five wickets in a Test innings for the 36th time, equalling the New Zealander Richard Hadlee's world record. Yet later Muralitharan said: \"I am still not fully fit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
