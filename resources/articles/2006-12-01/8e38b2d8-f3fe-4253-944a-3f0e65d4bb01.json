Communication barriers holding your company back? Wish your team could bond more? Maybe the answer to your problems is a festive drink. Not that we're suggesting you'll find solutions at the bottom of a bottle, but there are those who believe that the answer to effective team-building lies at the bottom of a cocktail shaker. Dan Wilks and Charlie Homberger run Cocktail Heaven events - which promise a night of bonding, fun and competitive martini-making. Such is the success of the enterprise that - alongside mixing the drinks at Kate Moss's parties - the pair spend a considerable amount of time teaching office workers how to create the perfect cocktail. But does an evening spent quaffing booze count as team-building? Surely, it's just Friday night by a different name? \"Originally, we started the course because we would always have people asking us for recipes and to show them how we made certain drinks and it seemed there was a real demand for that sort of training,\" explains Wilks. \"Over time, we've found that it works perfectly as a team-building event because there are lots of skills involved in making cocktails that help you work together as a team; you have to share responsibility with your partners, you need to be aware what your teammates are up to, but above all, it's just a great way to get to know your team and have some fun while you're doing it.\" Wilks insists that alcohol isn't the magic ingredient, pointing out that the company's non-alcoholic \"virgin\" events are equally successful. And, although their event is unique, Wilks and Homberger are not alone in offering companies a more exotic teambuilding experience. Gone are the days when you could unite executives by getting them to build a tower out of ice-lolly sticks. The modern team can only bond if they're go-karting or flying gliders. It seems that at some point team-building got confused with a seventh birthday party. Although these events may be fun, critics argue that they don't actually achieve their aims of building stronger teams. Bev Stone, a chartered business psychologist, believes that a lack of company time devoted to team development has seen the in-depth team-building exercises abandoned in favour of quick and quirky events. \"Although you might get a high level of buy-in with novelty team-building events and people have a bit of a giggle, in my experience they go home and say 'What did I actually get from that?' These aren't really team-building events, they're team-spirit building events and they're not going to help people to interact with each other.\" In the generous spirit of pseudo-scientific investigation, several members of the Office Hours team agree to put the Cocktail Heaven event to the test. You would be forgiven for thinking that the Office Hours team were a super-fluent editorial unit attuned to each other's every instinct. You may be surprised to learn that the event promises to be the first time that many of us have met face-to-face, so promising to be a stern test of Cocktail Heaven's teambuilding prowess. Can Wilks and Homberger take a mix of Guardian workers, freelancers and associated friends and shape them into a well-oiled machine? We rendezvous in the private bar of the Astor Bar and Grill, a cavernous and decadent room which threatens to swallow our mini-group, although it does have the all-important feature of a bar. Any initial awkwardness is numbed by the cocktail we are given on arrival. Homberger explains that we will be split into teams for the evening and Pamela, the Office Hours chief subeditor, gets the unfortunate task of being my teammate. Together we will mix three rounds of cocktails, with nettle and lemongrass martinis and cosmopolitans coming first. In theory, these first drinks will establish some of the requisite mixing skills and techniques in preparation for the third round, in which we will compete against our colleagues in a battle for bar bragging rights. The learning curve is steep. Homberger runs through the pouring technique (hold a count of just over a second for each 10ml measure required) and the bounce cut (a jaunty flick of the bottle which stops the liquid flowing and prevents you throwing alcohol in your customers' eyes ). It becomes clear that there is a lot to learn about the art of mixology - including the fact that no one really uses the term mixology, which restores a lot of faith I had lost in the bartending profession. To be frank, Pamela and I make a slow start and when we attempt to replicate Homberger's awesome orange peel flamethrower trick to garnish our cosmopolitans we can barely produce a guff of flame - that is until Pamela suddenly succeeds and flambes the glass, my face and several square yards of the bar. By the final round, the alcohol has seeped into our competitive spirit and all teams are anxious to do their best. The last test is a strawberry cheesecake shooter, a tricky little number which requires real teamwork as at certain points you need about five pairs of hands to hold a collection of glasses and strainers. We get to work muddling two large strawberries (or mushing them with a rolling pin to the uninitiated) and add a hefty two count of vodka, 10ml of strawberry liqueur and 5ml of sugar syrup. This mixture is shaken and strained into a cold shot glass. Then for the tricky bit: double cream is trickled down a bar spoon on top of the strawberry concoction and topped with biscuit crumbs. We sample our creation and declare ourselves impressed. However, in the professional analysis our effort was judged to be a tad too alcoholic to win. Personally, I lay the blame with Pamela. But as she will be editing this piece, by the time you read it, it might well have become my fault. With the event over we spill out onto the street as one slightly tipsy group. I'd love to tell you what happened next but my notes become erratic around this point. For several pages it just states \"I'm having fun\" and then there's a lengthy essay about crisps. My last memory of the evening is moonwalking around a pub. So was it a success? Well, aside from waking the next morning to a quite phenomenal headache, which I'm going to attribute to a lemongrass allergy, it seems hard to disagree with Stone that the key way these \"novelty\" team-building events function is as a social catalyst. Whether you could develop that buzz into more meaningful group interaction is questionable. It was undeniably a success in the sense that we went from a group of people who had barely met, to a happy mob content to chat away into the night. Perhaps if you've got real communication problems you should probably look elsewhere for your answers, but if you want a nice-breaker then breaking ice is a surprisingly good option."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
