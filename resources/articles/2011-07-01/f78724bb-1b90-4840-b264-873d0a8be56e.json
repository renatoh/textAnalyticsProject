Modric took the step after Tottenham, who have said he is not for sale at any price, rejected a second offer from Chelsea which valued the Croatia international at \u00a327m and followed a previous \u00a322m bid. The playmaker flew to South Africa with his team-mates for a pre-season tour out of respect for his manager, Harry Redknapp, who has repeatedly praised Modric's attitude and said he understood why the player was keen to join Chelsea. Redknapp has, though, joined Levy in stating that Modric is not for sale. At the weekend Modric openly criticised Levy in an interview with a Croatian newspaper and accused the chairman of breaking a gentleman's agreement to sell him to a bigger club this summer. Tottenham have denied making any such agreement and have been considering whether to fine Modric for his remarks. The 25-year-old has described Chelsea as his \"dream\" destination, saying he would like to move to play again in the Champions League next season and challenge regularly for trophies. Redknapp, speaking before news of Modric's transfer request became public, said he hoped the trip to South Africa would benefit Modric. During the 10-day tour Spurs are due to play in a tournament that also involves Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. \"Hopefully he will go away and get a bit of football now and just get on with it,\" Redknapp said. \"We hope that he will come back and get ready for the new season.\" Steven Pienaar would be one of the squad members who would benefit most from Modric's departure but he said he hoped the former Dinamo Zagreb player will stay. \"You are always looking to strengthen and for us it's important that we all stick together as a team and make the most of it,\" Pienaar told Sky Sports News. William Gallas has not travelled with the squad due to a calf problem and the defender Ledley King and the midfielder Sandro are out with knee injuries. Sandro will report to the club's training ground on Thursday to be assessed after the Brazilian Football Federation sent him home from the Copa Am\u00e9rica amid fears that he had torn the meniscus in his knee. The captain Michael Dawson has reacted angrily to claims that he has fallen out with the hierarchy at Tottenham over a new contract. \"I think I have always demonstrated that I am a proud player and captain of this club and nothing has changed in that respect,\" the central defender said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
