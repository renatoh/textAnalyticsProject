She was an accomplished swing pianist (former Billie Holiday accompanist Jimmy Rowles was a mentor), and an intelligent heiress to Shirley Horn and Carmen McRae. Then the same thing happened to her as had happened 40 years before to one of her biggest inspirations, Nat King Cole. Quiet Nights is the latest stage in the unjazzing of Diana Krall. As if fearing she might be overtaken in the sweet-nothings department by the even more whispery newcomer Melody Gardot, Krall here breathes her way through an entire album of songs about love and loss, mostly restricting herself to a smoky middle register - with a little samba-sensuality on the side. There's always something a bit weird about a very intimate record backed by a regiment of symphonic players. But though Krall makes a powerful job of You're My Thrill, and brings the oblique world-weary frankness of her earlier days to Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry, a Walk On By stripped of its soul roots sounds overly genteel, and Where Or When exhibits a hint of coyness she has never shown before. It sounds more like a production job than the personal testament to hubbie Elvis Costello that Krall has said the album represents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
