Visitors to the modest display, which was launched yesterday, can take a filmed tour of the vast concourses - the width of a four-lane highway - and the many restaurants and cafes (\"from finger buffets right up to five-star cuisine\"). Bright and airy, the spaces bear a closer resemblance to modern art galleries than to any previous model of football stadium. And their walls are decorated by hugely blown-up photographs of two England players. One, of course, is David Beckham, who is already a global marketing icon. The other is a 17-year-old with 1 senior international games behind him. No wonder David Moyes is concerned. Any dark suspicions that the Everton manager might be understudying Sir Alex Ferguson's role as Sven-Goran Eriksson's tormentor in chief are swiftly eroded by a realisation of the terrifying speed with which the FA's marketing men have seized on his prodigy as the symbol of their future prosperity. Rooney is a remarkable prospect. He has a wonderful football intelligence and plays the game with an intuitive spontaneity rarely seen in Englishmen. If all goes well, he will win matches and perhaps even tournaments for his country. At the moment, however, he is a gum-chewing kid who needs to be granted time and indulgence as he learns his profession. His self-confidence makes the case for his inclusion in Eriksson's team. That, however, does not give the FA a licence to exploit his fresh young image with such cold-blooded alacrity. And it certainly leads one to speculate on the existence of an extra layer of potential motive behind Eriksson's desire to check on the striker's fitness for next week's trip to South Africa. That telling detail aside, the Wembley presentation was reasonably impressive. Building work is definitely under way, and apparently running according to programme and budget. The 2006 FA Cup final will mark the planned inauguration, although if the project is completed ahead of schedule then a special celebratory fixture - perhaps England v Brazil, probably not England v Germany - might well be arranged. Bearing in mind that the contractors are working on a fixed-cost basis and are liable for their own overruns, that possibility should not be discounted. Others with greater resources at their disposal can be left to decide whether the corporate boxes are good value at prices ranging from \u00a360,000 a year for a six-seater to \u00a3210,000 for a top-of-the-range job for 20 people. But on Wembley's ability to sell these boxes, amounting to a total of 1,900 seats, and a further 15,000 seats to be sold via a debenture system, will depend the success of the whole enterprise. The debentures, which Wembley calls \"licences\", presupposes that there are people who will want to attend not merely all England's senior international matches but the FA Cup final and semi-finals, the League Cup final, the Community Shield and the Rugby League Challenge Cup final. If that is indeed a pattern of behaviour among English sports fans, then it is a new one. But let's hope it all works. The sheer scale of the thing is breathtaking - the new complex covers about twice the acreage of the old, and will be about three times higher. One particularly effective graphic, juxtaposing the old and new stadiums, looks like a tugboat moored alongside an aircraft carrier. Mocked-up photographs suggest that Norman Foster's illuminated steel arch will indeed provide a striking addition to the London skyline. Of the 90,000 places in the new stadium, 71,200 will be general admission. Spectators will be both closer to the pitch and more comfortable. England's football may not have made much progress since 1923, but wider seats and increased leg room at least take account of changes in human shape. The restaurants will enable 10,000 people to dine, and the number of lavatories has been increased from 361 to 2,618. Given the project's ugly history, a great deal of scepticism must remain over yesterday's unblinking claim that it will run at a profit. The soccer economy changed vastly after 1995, when the project was mooted, and then changed again. Decentprosperity gave way to dreams of infinite wealth, which were promptly dashed by a savage recession. Any body who claims to know what the game's economy will be like in three years' time is a liar. Whatever the financial climate in 2006, I hope Eriksson's team will be welcomed into their new home in time for a couple of warm-up matches before leaving for Germany and the World Cup finals. And I hope Rooney will have justified the FA's faith. It's just the time between that I worry about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
