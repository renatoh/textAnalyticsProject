On leaving the Commons in one of the darkest moments of the First World War, the great man said: 'This little place is what makes the difference between us and Germany ... this little room is the shrine of the world's liberties.' Tony Blair has never shown the thrill and grand romance that formed the centre of Churchill's political being. To modernising New Labour, the quotation seems bufferish sentiment made for another age. Instead of revering Parliament, Blair disparaged and bypassed it, imposing measures that undermined the Commons' power to scrutinise legislation and bring the executive to account. It is these policies, surely the expression of personality rather than any coherent philosophy, that have caused a disturbance in the constitutional life of the country and which have now led to discussion about how to strengthen Parliament and whether to place a new, homegrown system of rights beyond Parliament's reach. These two aims may be at odds, but let us first be clear that Parliament's role and individual rights and liberty would not both be on the agenda if it were not for the carelessness and depredations of the Blair government. Jack Straw has floated the possibility of a written constitution. Off-the-record conversations at the Institute of Public Policy Research think-tank have ranged across national questions and a written constitution; there has been a seminar at 11 Downing Street on these matters and a gathering at Hay literary festival of lawyers, writers, scientists and administrators turned into a fascinating exchange about the possibility of placing a code of rights - specifically homegrown - beyond the meddling of future Parliaments. Added to these is Clarke's excellent report which suggests ways of rolling back the executive and giving Parliament more power and the people greater expression in the business of the Commons. There is something in the air but not yet a wind of change. The problem is that the three subjects - parliamentary independence, a bill of rights and relations between England and Scotland - all tend to merge into one intractable, befuddling mega-issue. People tend to focus on one area to the exclusion of the others. Those who refuse to concede the reality of Labour's attack on rights and liberty think only about the national question and worry themselves sick about Britishness. Those, like me, concerned about centralisation of authority, the loss of liberty and rights, as documented in the new film Taking Liberties, tend to the view that the priorities are Parliament and a bill of rights. No matter what the intelligence and wisdom applied, the issues swirl like a dust storm - dry, heated and without much substance. We need leadership and a clear path through it all, which may be provided by Gordon Brown; on the other hand, it may not. The crucial point is that we must do the accounting on Labour's last 10 years and that involves wrenching admissions from the ranks of New Labour about Blair's attitude to Parliament and civil liberties. It will be just as hard as getting them to concede the disaster of the Iraq war. But let us not forget the sour little irony that the passing of the Human Rights Act inaugurated Blair's campaign against rights that spread through every possible legislative avenue. The HRA, like the Freedom of Information Act, became the rolling alibi for any number of shifty Labour footpads. Meanwhile, the Blair developed his theory of selective rights, rights that were, in fact, privileges allowed to only those the government thought deserving. At least he has been open about it. When three men on control orders absconded recently, he wrote: 'We as a country have decided that ... the threat to public safety does not justify radically changing the legal basis on which we confront terrorism. Their right to traditional civil liberties comes first. I believe that is a dangerous misjudgment.' All you need to know about Blair's approach to civil liberties is here. It is this attitude which has allowed rendition flights to use British airports - with or without the bound and terrified victims of US torture programmes - and which has ignored the disgrace of Guantanamo. He simply doesn't get the principle that rights must be applied equally to the innocent as well as suspects and those convicted of crimes. That is the wonder and the very great burden of a system of rights and it is neither modern or pragmatic to abandon that principle. The interregnum ends soon and the new Prime Minister, presently lost in an unfathomable and gloomy contemplation of his first 100 days, must address all this quickly. His instincts about the propriety of government appear good. Career civil servants are being appointed as advisers on international relations and Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell, is proposing changes to the way Number 10 is run. Meetings will be minuted, sofa government will end. But this is no more than changing the wallpaper. If he is to be a great Prime Minister, as opposed to someone who simply wields the power of the office, Gordon Brown will need to provide an intellectual synthesis of the three areas - parliamentary independence, liberty and rights and the union between England and Scotland. The paper produced by the Conservatives Democracy Task Force is important because it is fair and portrays Parliament as it is - the loss to the media of authority and responsiveness, the increased workload of MPs, particularly with constituents and pressure groups, the tyranny of whips over select committee appointments, the lack of resources for important select committees, the failures in scrutiny and ministerial accountability and the all-important loss of public faith. Few will disagree with Clarke's suggestions of replacing the whips' role in the appointment of select committee chairmen with a ballot of the whole house, of creating more scope for timely debates and reducing government control over the timetable. I like the idea of Commons committees with the power and independence of US congressional committees. Why not allow e-petitions to spark debates? Let's give more power to the committee overseeing the European affairs. Let's have more private member's bills. Let's see select committee chairmen bring their reports to the chamber for debate. Let's have more debate. More argument. More cross-party groups. More goddam life. Anything is better than the chamber of the living dead that this shallow, unread 'modernising' regime created. Brown will probably steal some of the best suggestions and fill the gaps in Labour policy, even though there are good reasons to suspect he has 'executive power' tattooed somewhere above his hairline. The interesting part of the Clarke report, which is essential reading, is that in seeking to restore life and power to Parliament, there is an implicit argument against a bill of rights because such a bill would place certain areas of law beyond MPs' reach. That challenges the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Power would pass to unelected judges. I have few problems with this, given the judiciary's record in standing up to Blair, but the loss of parliamentary sovereignty, even in its current limp manifestation, would be a profound change in our constitution and this needs care and consideration. For one thing, it might weaken Parliament further. Parliament is at the heart of the crisis of Britishness. If renewed in the way that Clarke suggests, it will come to reassert British values because values don't just appear out of the blue; they are spawned by the proper functioning of ancient institutions. New Labour believes that anything old should be ignored, sidelined or reinvented in the hideous new language of pro-social citizenship and that is one of the reasons it has failed the country's primary institution - Parliament. By the way, if we are to have a day that marks Britishness, why not 15 June, the date on which Magna Carta was signed at Runnymede in 1215? In the meantime, the best we can do is to restore the shrine to the world's liberties. henry.porter@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
