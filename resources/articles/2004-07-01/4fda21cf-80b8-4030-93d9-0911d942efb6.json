Next imagine the pain of recounting over and over how it felt, how the experience has made you stronger, how you never look back. Then spare a thought for Thomas Bjorn. One year ago, over the sun-burnished links of Royal St George's, the Dane was within three rock-steady holes of winning the Open championship, only to haemorrhage shots, let in Ben Curtis and send himself to purgatory. The nadir came at the 16th, where twice he failed to extricate himself from sand and dropped two shots. Never mind that he had also cost himself two strokes in the first round by slamming his club into a bunker. The championship was in its infancy then; here he was in control of his destiny, and he blew it. What turmoil went through his mind, only he knew. For 69 holes he had played the best golf of his life only to be stripped naked in front of millions. Humiliated. A further shot dropped at the penultimate hole and it was all but gone. And every week closer to another Open, the more the memory has been brought back to him. Two weeks ago, in Ireland, he simply abandoned a round after six holes and walked in. Yesterday he faced his demons one last time. After this week they will be banished in favour of the latest fall guy and Bjorn will be left to move on. He has already begun the process of picking up the pieces, returning to familiar territory with his old coach Pete Cowan, no longer searching for the intangible something to elevate his game but content that at its best his game, with whatever faults there may be, is a match for anyone's - acceptance that when he imploded and handed the title to the biggest outsider in the championship's history it was not his swing which let him down but his mind. Cowan is his comfort blanket. On the course, Bjorn appears inscrutable. He furrows his beetle brows and fixes his stare on the turf in front, indifferent to the periphery. He is in his zone. For hole after hole last year he ground out his position, holding steady as others faltered over the stiffest of examinations on the back nine. And not a flicker of emotion, not even when a rare birdie gave him a two-shot cushion and a bogey next hole took it away again just to keep him honest. \"I don't think people understand how focused we are,\" he said yesterday. \"You are so determined, you don't think that these things can happen to you. I don't see anything; my eyes are in the ground. And I never thought about things that could happen to me over the closing holes.\" But someone found a way into the bubble. Walking from 15th green to 16th tee, he was unable any longer to ignore the shouts of support. Fleetingly, as one last cry of \"Come on Thomas\" rang out, the mask slipped and a thin smile lit his face. For the past year, life has not been the same. So the prodigal son has returned to Cowan, whom he abandoned in search of fool's gold. \"Going back to him, it is a question of really clearing out the things that have been going on,\" he said. \"I've kept him close to me pretty much ever since Ireland. I know that when I've got confidence I can turn it around very quickly. \"Players are often guilty of going searching for things that don't exist and certainly I've been guilty of that. Now I think I need to stick with what I am good at and just try to do it that little bit better.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
