But now the dire economics is shaking politics up. Amid frenzied markets, and with depression threatening, the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, spoke yesterday. In place of soft soap about muddling through, he said this was the EU's gravest crisis, which only fresh integration could solve. Mr Barroso does not, of course, face voters directly, but Angela Merkel now looks as if she just might follow his federalist lead. A better-designed single currency might have allowed Greece to default within the euro, and take the consequences. But the continent is saddled with the euro it has got, complete with inadequate regulations that have bound fiscal fates together. The French banks that were allowed to treat Greek debt as failsafe now face a bust that only public funds can fix. Seeing as the financial risks have no respect for national boundaries, there is logic in Mr Barroso's suggestion of managing them collectively. The immediate issue is persuading 17 separate parliaments to unlock the emergency stability fund. On Wednesday it was Finland's turn, on Thursday it is Germany's. The votes of opposition social democrats guarantee assent there, although the future of Mrs Merkel's coalition could be threatened if rebellions in her own ranks force her to rely on these. After Berlin, the eyes of a continent will turn to Bratislava, where Slovakian acquiescence will prove tougher to obtain. Plainly, this is no way to operate in a crisis. The most frightening thing, as Mrs Merkel now concedes, is that the cash in the kitty is no longer enough. If there were an easy way to let Greece leave or Germany quit, then this would have to be considered. The reality, brought home by UBS research, is that there is not. With no legal exit route, the validity of EU treaties would suddenly be in question \u2013 and amid a deepening slump which would inflame mercantilism and so preclude renegotiation. The crisis could thus turn existential, for the European project as a whole. All sorts of wheezes are being dreamed up to delay the reckoning, such as \"leveraging\" support-fund monies so they can buy more bonds, a trick with unfortunate echoes of the bubble before the bust. A technically more satisfactory fix would involve Europe's central bank taking it upon itself to print whatever funds are required, but while this bureaucracy arguably possesses legal authority to go down this route, it could soon find its wings clipped if it tried to fly solo, without the blessings of the sceptical Germans. The more sustainable route involves a grand bargain, with Europe's north underwriting southern borrowing in return for federal disciplines and centralised taxes, just as the commission proposes. The obstacles are legion, from Germany's constitutional court to British obstructionism, which was evident yesterday in George Osborne's kneejerk rejection of the timely commission proposal for a Tobin tax. Then there is the small matter of the politics. Mr Barroso won a warm hearing at the European parliament; beyond its walls, things are trickier. The EU is handicapped by the lack of an identifiable figurehead: Mr Barroso and the council president, Herman van Rompuy, both have a claim to that role; neither cuts through in sceptical countries. Even as Mr Osborne urges the eurozone to get its act together, his officials are struggling to ensure any solution does not trigger a doomed referendum under the coalition's Brussels-baiting legislation. While such obstructionism can be condemned, the need for democratic consent cannot be willed away. It will be required even in the multi-speed Europe Mr Barroso envisages. It can be achieved only through arguments of the sort that leaders like Mrs Merkel are just beginning to make. Let's hope they have not left it too late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
