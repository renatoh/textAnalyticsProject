Wilshere was named man of the match after the victory \u2013 which secured a second successive Emirates Cup for the host team \u2013 and has been impressive during Arsenal's pre-season programme, having started each of the five fixtures so far. Having loaned the 18-year-old to Bolton Wanderers last season, Wenger now feels the midfielder is ready to play more regularly for Arsenal, a sentiment that is sure to excite the club's supporters who first saw Wilshere in action when, at the age of 16, he became the youngest player to represent the club in the league in September 2008. \"At 18 years of age you can have patience with a player, but I believe Wilshere is stronger than last year,\" Wenger said. \"The few months he played at Bolton has definitely given him something. He will be used by us [next season] for sure.\" Wilshere has also impressed the England manager, Fabio Capello, so much so that after last year's Emirates Cup, when the teenager also shone, the Italian suggested he was ready to play for his country at the highest level. That did not happen and instead Wilshere has gone on to become a regular for the England Under-21 side. But ahead of the qualifying campaign for Euro 2012, Wenger believes Wilshere can now be considered a serious contender for selection. \"For [Euro] 2012, he will be 20, that is a good age, so he cannot be ruled out for England,\" he said. Asked if it was too early for Capello to pick Wilshere, Wenger replied: \"No, you must deal with that with all good footballers. Theo [Walcott] was in the squad for the 2006 World Cup and it didn't kill him.\" The manager also praised other Arsenal players today, including Wilshere's partner in midfield Emmanuel Frimpong and the goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, who returned to the team in place of Lukasz Fabianski. Both Almunia and Fabianski are under pressure going into the new season given Wenger's interest in signing a new goalkeeper, with Fulham's Mark Schwarzer a target. A centre\u2011back is also wanted and again, Wenger did not rule out a move for the Germany defender Per Mertesacker. \"I do not like to speak about players by name but I definitely want at least one defender,\" he said when asked about Mertesacker. Arsenal next face Legia Warsaw on Saturday in their final pre-season game, while Celtic face Braga at home on Wednesday in the second leg of their Champions League third qualifying round tie, having lost the first leg 3-0. Neil Lennon has not given up hope of his side overcoming the Portuguese side. \"I was pleased with the spirit we showed today,\" he said. \"The team have shown we have good players and can compete and that has given me food for thought ahead of Wednesday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
