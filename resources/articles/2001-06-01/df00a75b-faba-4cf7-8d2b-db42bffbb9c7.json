Ethical investing - now relabelled socially responsible investment, or SRI - is firmly on the mainstream agenda. But how do investors mix principles with profit? Even where fund managers have no direct interest in the green agenda, they have to take notice. Share prices now rise and fall on ethical decisions as holders of American tobacco company and international oil company shares know only too well. SRI is about pressure on companies to behave rather than the purist line of simply shunning sin concerns. The key to all this, according to Robert Monks, author of The New Global Investors (Capstone \u00a319.99) is that investors can only unlock sustainable prosperity worldwide if they act as real shareholders taking a direct interest in their stakes, instead of leaving it to managers and acting as absentee landlords, content to sit back and passively pick up profits without knowing or caring where they came from. \"The splitting of management from ownership gave investors new freedoms but it has had disastrous effects,\" he says. \"Passive ownership has created management hegemony, but as skyrocketing chief executive salaries show, resources are enriching corporate leaders rather than providing returns to owners - and thus society.\" Mr Monks believes concentration of ownership in huge pension funds evens matters up. Powerful managers now have to face powerful owners who are not afraid to show their muscle. This week, the National Association of Pension Funds has published Engaging for Success, which suggests funds should analyse, engage and influence - the recipe for SRI. Since last July, pension fund trustees must disclose in statements of investment principles \"the extent (if at all) to which social, environmental and ethical considerations are taken into account\". The NAPF guidelines point to the Good Corporation Charter, which is about to be launched by the Institute of Business Ethics. It is a 21-point charter to which companies can sign up. They will be certified independently once a year. \"This will not be a gold standard but a step on the road to corporate social responsibility,\" the IBE says. Mainstream investors will soon have a measurement system to end arguments over principles versus profits. The FTSE4Good index, which opens for business next month (July) will weigh up share prices of companies that conform to SRI principles, leaving the wider market covered by existing measures. The index will give a new impetus to ethical tracker trusts - those currently run by Legal &amp; General and NPI suffer because there is no easily available benchmark to measure the trusts against. FTSE will reassess inclusions and exclusions every six months. Except for total \"no-no\" sectors such as tobacco, armaments and animal testing for cosmetics, the object is to be inclusive. This will appeal to the engagers who believe in improvement through dialogue not the excluders. Around 60% of major companies will qualify - they will have to show good practice and measurable environmental performance. But it will become tougher to stay in as \"hurdles\" will go up over time. These will be higher for environmental impact industries - such as mining or agriculture. FTSE is prepared for a barrage of criticism. \"We don't expect activists to abseil our office block. But we do expect controversy,\" it says. \"Besides pressure groups who will say we're not strict enough, excluded companies could complain as well. We shall have transparent rules and firms will be able to challenge decisions,\" it says. Get your free guide Ethical investment is growing fast, but what is it? Where does the border between ethical and execrable lie? It is all a matter of individual perception. Some will be relaxed about alcohol but outraged over road building or the refusal to recognise unions. A number want companies to pull out of developing world manufacturing and bring the work home. Others say these jobs are essential to growing economies, providing minimum standards are followed. Some favour engagement to improve companies, others want to avoid all firms that transgress or sell existing shares in companies without principles.
