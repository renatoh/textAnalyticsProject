Perhaps not quite yet, if the surprisingly lukewarm level of high-fiving directed towards Grant after Chelsea's heroic midweek duffing-up of Valencia is anything to go by. Results alone might not be enough to turn the corner. It looks like only an emergency Premier League makeover can shake Grant's ineffable air of outsiderness. The good news is, fitting in isn't particularly difficult. A few simple steps ought to do it. Get a \"thing\" All managers need a thing. Sam Allardyce has his great, jowly butcher's-block head. Steve Coppell has his air of repeated but quietly born disappointment. Grant needs a deceptively simple mannerism. Perhaps he could make a habit of eating a sandwich or savoury wrap very slowly in the technical area, or affecting a theatrical swoon like Charles Hawtrey in Carry On Again Doctor whenever something exciting happens. Ball cleared off the line: whoops, there he goes again. Be more handsome A work in progress: Grant's decision to ditch the nylon leisurewear in favour of a well-cut suit is already paying off, lending him the appearance of a tenacious if initially hostile defence lawyer in a US TV legal sitcom, who later turns out to have a twinkly smile and a heart of gold. Might work even better if he could get hold of some kind of robe or wig or Masonic apron. Be awestruck by John Terry Needs to do more of this. Currently Terry performs a vital function, operating as a one-man bulwark against English football's creeping sense of a world staffed with fanny-merchants and swarthy skilful types unsuited to gutsing it out in a trench in Grimsby in February in a hailstorm. Terry makes us feel strong and safe. But still we worry vaguely. Could it be that, somewhere along the line, we're missing the bigger picture? Jose Mourinho knew the form: nothing but praise for JT. Open a nightclub Worked for Terry Venables. Start a pointless public feud A difficult area as all the best ones have already gone. Grant may have to think outside the box: a gratuitous roughing-up of Chris Hutchings, a vendetta against the third-string football reporter on the East Sheen Gazette. Snub Leyton Orient's youth team coach. Jostle Martha Kearney. Whatever it takes. Get Michael Palin involved A popularity nuclear weapon. Perhaps Palin could just stand next to Grant for a bit; they could do some funny voices together, like Prince Charles and the Goons. Ideally you'd want a buddied-up travel documentary series on BBC2, called something like Mick and Av Skateboard the Sahara, or Travels With My Grant: In Search Of The Real Fulham Broadway. Do a self-deprecatory TV advert \"Hi, I'm Avram Grant. Take it from me, you don't need to be a special one to get cheap, cheap deals on pet insurance\". A wink and a cheery wave. Look, there's Avram Grant consolidating all his debts into one low monthly payment. Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all. Actually, best to save this one for after Christmas. When he's a little more, you know, available."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
