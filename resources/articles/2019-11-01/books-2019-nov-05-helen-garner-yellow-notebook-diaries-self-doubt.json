This is the place where the secret self goes, unwatched, into a locked and private vault. Getting in can be an evil joy. Marry this with the well-known predilections of a writer like Helen Garner, whose reputation for unflinching self-interrogation precedes her, and the anticipation is almost too much. Is it safe to go in? Do you really want to see the things you will find here? Anyone familiar with Garner\u2019s body of work \u2013 the way the writer threads her own vulnerability into her narrative strands \u2013 will understand the trepidation. Once, when the literary journalist Susan Wyndham profiled her, she perfectly described the feeling of reading her, the way she dives into a story, heart thumping on her sleeve: \u201cOh Helen, you want to say, be careful!\u201d And so the reader tiptoes carefully into Helen Garner\u2019s published diaries. Yellow Notebook \u2013 Diaries Volume 1: 1978-1987 unlocks the private vault of the mind of an author at the beginning of her career. Garner has already admitted to burning her earlier diaries \u2013 the mortification of re-reading them was too much to bear \u2013 and 1978 finds her able to hear her own unvarnished voice without wincing. Her first novel, the famously autobiographical Monkey Grip, has just been published and has started winning awards when we slip into Garner\u2019s river of consciousness. \u201cMaybe it\u2019d be a good idea to start another diary, just to cream it off. I bought this yellow book today.\u201d We don\u2019t know what it is she wants to cream off, or even what it means, but this first nonsensical moment won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s a writer\u2019s journal, after all, not moulded into a cohesive or cogent narrative with a beginning, a middle and an end. There is the first page, and the last, and a thousand thoughts, observations, laughs, writerly quotes and much wailing and gnashing of teeth in between. At first, being inside Helen Garner\u2019s head is discombobulating. She pinballs from deep and meaningful to banal and back again, and it takes a while to settle into the lack of rhythm. She also doesn\u2019t name the central characters that populate her life during these eight Yellow Notebook years, giving them each an initial instead. It can be hard, initially, to keep track of who\u2019s who. There are friends, B, Y and T; there is K and there is L, who may or may not be lovers, we can\u2019t be 100% sure. M is her daughter, the focus of Garner\u2019s savage maternal love, her wonder, her playful affection. J is her writer friend with whom she shares thoughts of her nascent Christianity, F is her then husband, and the diary finds them at a time when their marriage is disintegrating. There are references to fights and tears and conflict, of other relationships, then the sadness of it being over, the questioning about whether she will ever love, be loved again. These are deeply intimate thoughts and references, but once again the full picture eludes the reader \u2013 even in the safety of her own diary, Garner\u2019s observations are elliptical, poetic, impressionistic. Naturally this is something written only for one comprehending reader, the self, and yet here we all are now, grabbing at details that are wafting about like incense. It doesn\u2019t matter. Important elements remain. This raises the question for journal-keepers: of what should we make detailed note? While Garner\u2019s major dramas remain slightly out of focus, little images are sharp and wonderful \u2013 the smell of the rain in the middle of the night, the praying mantis in the twig of bottlebrush with three flowers on it, the morning sun carefully warming her back through the cyclone wire fence. These are the precious moments that would surely fade without keeping record. The sensory nature of her observations are glorious, as are detailed descriptions of other humans in various social interactions. Strangers, friends, lovers and fellow writers provide a multitude of vignettes, the sort which undoubtedly inform her published writing: these are piquant, physically detailed, gimlet-eyed. Pick up The Children\u2019s Bach, the novel she was writing during this time, and you might see glimpses there. You will certainly see, in the Yellow Notebook, what later becomes one of her greatest skills \u2013 reporting on the grand human drama of the courtroom, exemplified in books like This House of Grief and Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation. She writes from time to time of gruesome crimes, then she makes what seems to be her first visit to a criminal trial \u2013 the daughter of a man she knows has been murdered, and Garner attends court. \u201cFascination seized me,\u201d she writes. But it is not only the \u201cshock of detail\u201d of that particular case that grabs her, but the nature of law itself. The man was found guilty. And the judge directed the jury to acquit the woman because the charge against her could not be proved. We all stood up, incredulous. But then came to me a sharp flash of illumination: what we were bowing to was not this thin, tough faced man in a red robe, but to the power that he exercised, that passed through him, that our society gives him. I felt the spirit of the law \u2013 something tremendous restraining itself by reason. They really do have to prove it. On the subject of spirits, also omnipresent is what Garner refers to as the mighty force. These days Garner speaks openly about being a Christian, but in the Yellow Notebook she is really wrestling with religiosity, and what it means for her identity. It frightens her, it dogs her, she worries it will end relationships. Garner\u2019s self-doubt is perhaps the strongest thread in the journals \u2013 even self-proclaimed self-disgust is explored \u2013 and the years 1978-1986 do not seem to weary it. She hauls herself over the coals on many fronts: her love life (\u201cno wonder he can\u2019t stand me. I can hardly stand myself\u201d), her writing skill (\u201cgrief is not too strong a word for what one feels before one\u2019s own weakness and mediocrity\u201d), her personality (\u201ca sack of different sadnesses being hauled around by a skeleton\u201d) \u2026 that Garner tendency to unsparingly and brutally self-evaluate. Oh Helen, you want to say, go easy on yourself. But there is a strange kind of comfort and comradeship in knowing a writer of Garner\u2019s skill and force has experienced so much self-doubt, and that this doubt has clearly been no impediment to her success. This constant questioning, this searching, has become the leitmotif of Garner\u2019s body of work, and over the years has transformed her vulnerability into her greatest strength. It\u2019s a privilege to draw back the curtain and see the workings of it. \u2022 Yellow Notebook \u2013 Diaries Volume 1: 1978-1987 by Helen Garner is out 5 November through Text Publishing.
