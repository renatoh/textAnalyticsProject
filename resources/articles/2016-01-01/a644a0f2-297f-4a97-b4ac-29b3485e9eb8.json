Then, after a few diplomatic platitudes, the England winger bins all false modesty and reveals his real feelings. Newcastle United\u2019s new \u00a312m signing from Tottenham Hotspur has just been asked if he was worth that transfer fee. \u201cIt\u2019s for you to decide,\u201d he begins. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money. I know that \u2026 but if I can reach my potential and play to the ability I know I have then I\u2019m sure that those people who are saying it\u2019s a lot of money for me will quickly be saying it was a bargain. If I put in a few good performances it will look like money well spent.\u201d Steve McClaren is hoping for similarly startling changes of pace and touches of on-pitch swagger from a player who acknowledges he has much to prove after swapping Tottenham\u2019s deep freeze for the St James\u2019 Park spotlight. \u201cI\u2019ve got a massive point to prove now and hopefully Newcastle will benefit from that,\u201d says a 24-year-old frozen out by Mauricio Pochettino. \u201cMy last full 90 minutes in the Premier League was just under two years ago so I\u2019ve not played consistently in a long time. \u201cBut the last time I played nine or 10 successive Premier League games I was kind of setting the world alight. I can\u2019t wait to get a run of games and consistency going, and hopefully get back to that level. I have faith in my ability. I\u2019m the same player and the same person that was tipped as a big England prospect. Physically, I\u2019m in the best shape of my life but I haven\u2019t had a run of games since 2013.\u201d McClaren trusts Townsend\u2019s attempts to relaunch his career in time to force his way into England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad will serve as a catalyst, helping Newcastle avoid relegation. \u201cI\u2019m looking to become even better than before,\u201d says the winger who is likely to be deployed on the left but can operate on both flanks. \u201cI feel I\u2019m more mature \u2013 and that Newcastle\u2019s the right stage to showcase my ability.\u201d Doing so will involve McClaren\u2019s third January recruit \u2013 Jonjo Shelvey and Henri Saivet are the others \u2013 embarking on a mission to ensure Newcastle escape the bottom three. \u201cI\u2019m confident we have the ability to stay up,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy but, if you look around the dressing room, it\u2019s got to fill you with confidence. These players are good enough. I wouldn\u2019t have joined otherwise. I\u2019m extremely confident \u2013 and the manager\u2019s confident \u2013 we can climb the table.\u201d Should Newcastle\u2019s fortunes revive, images of France in June will start coming into ever sharper focus, although Townsend is adamant they are not on his immediate horizon. \u201cRoy Hodgson\u2019s always had faith in my ability and included me in squads,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time he\u2019s put me on the pitch, I\u2019ve repaid that faith. But I need to take baby steps. I\u2019ve not played in the Premier League for a couple of months now. I need to focus solely on Newcastle and Premier League survival. If I can do that and score a few goals along the way, hopefully the England stuff will come off the back of that.\u201d McClaren welcomed him with a special film. \u201cWe had a sit-down and went through my strengths and weaknesses and then he showed me a 10-minute video of exactly what he wants me to bring to the team,\u201d reveals a Londoner hoping to emulate the exploits of his boyhood hero David Ginola on Tyneside. \u201cIt surprised me; I\u2019ve never had that before. But it just shows how much homework the manager does.\u201d Amid all the excitement about the future, Townsend makes it clear he would have preferred to leave Spurs differently. Demoted to the Under-21s after a row with Nathan Gardiner, a fitness coach, following a win against Aston Villa in early November, he quickly learned there would be no way back under Pochettino. \u201cI\u2019d been at Spurs for 16 years, the best part of my life, so to leave was obviously a sad moment,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not playing you do suffer but the manager had no problem with me on a personal level. He made his decision professionally. Obviously I don\u2019t agree but Tottenham are flying high so I can\u2019t argue. Unfortunately the first team were in Barcelona when I left so I didn\u2019t manage to speak to him before coming here but I hold no grudges with the manager.\u201d The same goes for Gardiner. \u201cThat\u2019s done and dusted,\u201d Townsend says. \u201cThere was an incident but the next time I saw him we laughed about it, shook hands and just let it go. The club disciplined me but I don\u2019t think it had any bearing on my exclusion from the first-team squad.\u201d Instead he believes Pochettino had already made his mind up about him as a footballer but hints that Daniel Levy harboured a different view. \u201cThe chairman called me this morning, wished me all the best for the future and said I\u2019d be welcome back at Tottenham any time,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was nice of him. It didn\u2019t end well and I left Tottenham with a heavy heart but I know the chairman still believes in me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
