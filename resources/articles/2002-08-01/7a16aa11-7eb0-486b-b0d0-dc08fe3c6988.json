They backed Nayef down to 6-4 favourite to reverse the King George form with Golan and from the moment he kicked on with just over three furlongs to run their pay-out looked pretty secure. It was not the head-to-head duel that many had hoped to see, and - perhaps because a soaring new grandstand is still under construction - there was no wall of noise to meet them on the run to the line. This was a messy race, too, because Starbourne, who was supposed to set a strong pace for Golan, did not have the speed for the job. Yet still there was an air of confidence and power about Nayef to suggest that he will scale other peaks before the season closes. He was just half a length in front of Golan at the line, with Noverre another length and a half farther back in third. Had the pace been better, though, he would probably have won with more authority. The King George has finished some great horses, but it clearly left no mark on him. \"After the race at Ascot I felt that he was at peace with himself,\" Tregoning said, \"and he's just thrived since.\" It was the same last year, when Nayef repaid Tregoning's patience after a poor start to the season and blossomed in the Champion Stakes just as the leaves started to turn. That race is an obvious target again, and the one which Hamdan Al Maktoum, his owner, is said to prefer. It would be fascinating, though, to see him sent instead to the Breeders' Cup Classic a week later on October 26. \"He's very effective on dirt as he showed in Dubai [this spring],\" Tregoning added. \"A lot of American trainers have said to me that they might work well on it and score good times, but when you race on it it's a different thing because you've got to put up with the kick-back, the hurly burly. But why shouldn't he handle it? He's an older horse now and he's brave.\" Nayef was taken out of the Arc betting by Hill's, although Ladbrokes cut him to 8-1 from 10-1. Golan is unchanged on 7-1 with Hill's for that race, although if High Chaparral, the Derby winner and 5-2 favourite, makes it to Longchamp in October it is hard to see Coolmore Stud, who own half of Golan, sending another of their own up against him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
