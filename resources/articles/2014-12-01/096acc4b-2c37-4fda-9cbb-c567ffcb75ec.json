The news comes the same day that the company announced a restructuring plan that will \u201ccentralize operations\u201d and \u201cresult in the loss of some positions\u201d. Chairman of the board David D\u2019Alessandro will serve as interim CEO starting on 15 January until the board picks a replacement. \u201cWe remain committed to our growth agenda and enhancing value for our shareholders,\u201d D\u2019Alessandro said in a statement. \u201cThe Board intends to complete the search process deliberately and thoughtfully to find the right individual with the experience and qualifications to lead the company into the future.\u201d The company has been plagued by bad publicity since the release of the documentary Blackfish in October 2013. The film painted an unsavory picture of how the company treats its signature killer whales. The company has been fighting the negative publicity tide ever since. Shortly after the film was released, SeaWorld created a section on its website dedicated to fighting the claims made in the movie, which also aired on CNN. \u201cIt firmly crosses the line of what you would expect from a news organization,\u201d Atchison told Bloomberg in December 2013. \u201cThey are leveraging the imprimatur of a news agency for what really, clearly is another business venture of theirs, which is buying and marketing films.\u201d Atchison will become vice-chairman of the board and also be nominated to chairman of the board for the company\u2019s nonprofit \u2013 SeaWorld &amp; Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. He has held the top position since 2009, having previously served as executive vice-president and general manager of SeaWorld Orlando from 2003 to 2007. The restructuring initiative announced on Thursday will affect all of the company\u2019s 11 parks. \u201cIn order to achieve the goals of our business realignment, we regret that some positions will necessarily be eliminated,\u201d Atchison said in a statement. \u201cHowever, our cost savings effort is part of a broader program to position us for long term growth.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
