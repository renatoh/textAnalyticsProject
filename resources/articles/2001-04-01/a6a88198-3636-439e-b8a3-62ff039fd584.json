The four-girl band are depicted in a gents' toilet, apparently dying of embarrassment. Flip the sleeve and a young couple - mercifully not members of the band - are pictured having sex on the toilet floor. Such imagery might be almost understandable if the band were lad mag-friendly rockers, but it bears no relation to the Hertfordshire foursome's textured folk rock. They had nurtured a moderate following on the live circuit, but this seems to be the sort of rubbish they have to deal with now they have signed to a major record label. In person the girls are more natural. After months of production-line bands, it's a relief to encounter a girl group (with the exception of a male drummer) who aren't stick-thin and haven't been styled like an FHM photoshoot. Comprising a guitarist, a cellist, a singer and a multi-instrumentalist in loose, functional clothing, they have a highly endearing, matey vulnerability. When lead singer Paula Cox's first words to Manchester are ripped apart by feedback, she grins sweetly and says, \"A nice note!\" It's easy to understand Epic's attraction to a band who cover all bases from Corrs jauntiness to Alanis Morissette stridency to the acoustic purity of indie faves the Sundays. Cox has at least six voices, ranging from a delicate romanticism to a ballsy shriek that would terrify PJ Harvey. This early in their career, it's good that that the band can't be pigeonholed but it also means their set is confusing, and songs range from the moderately glorious to the ghastly; one is a bit Astrid Gilberto, another like Jane Siberry backed by Elvis's 1950s band. One fears for the psychological state of their \"typical\" fan. The songs that sound like the Sundays, such as Peace of Mind, fare best, but elsewhere even the raven-haired singer covers her ears to fend off another discordant clarinet solo. There's real promise here but the Bush desperately need to take a firm hand and sort out a direction. They should start with their next record sleeve. \u0095 The Bush, the Tree and Me play the Old Fire Station, Bournemouth (01202 503888), on Wednesday and the Scala, London N1 (020-7833 2022), on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false}}}
