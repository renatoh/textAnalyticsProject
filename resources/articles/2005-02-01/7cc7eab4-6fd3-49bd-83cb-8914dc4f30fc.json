The Neath-Swansea full-back capped a superb all-round performance by taking over kicking duty from Stephen Jones in the 76th minute and driving his penalty between the posts to send the home crowd into delirium. The win, Wales' first over England in Cardiff since 1993, was exactly what the Welsh deserved, having subdued the world champions with an at-times dazzling but always disciplined display. The Welsh forwards more than matched their English counterparts and in the early stages the visitors found it virtually impossible to build any kind of platform for possession - 18 year-old centre Matthew Tait didn't get his first touch of the ball until the 17th minute, and was promptly flattened by a bulldozing tackle by Henson. Wales were already in front by that stage thanks to a wonderful ninth-minute try from Shane Williams, who dived in at the corner after a sweeping cross-field move. Stephen Jones failed to convert the conversion from the try line, meaning that when Charlie Hodgson slotted over a penalty six minutes later England were just two points behind despite being utterly uninspired. Jones found his range, however, in the 22nd minute when he converted a penalty to put the Welsh 8-3 in front. England lock Danny Grewcock was lucky to escape a red card just before half-time when his boot forcefuly found the forehead of the crouching Dwayne Peel. Grewcock was only sin-binned, as was Gareth Thomas, who had reacted to the lock's blatant offence by rushing 15 metres to chin him. The sides both when in for the break with 14 men, and wales leading 8-3. England perked up slightly in the second half and began to spend sustained periods in the Welsh half. They failed, however, to achieve any penetration until around the hour mark, when they adopted a marked change of strategy: virtually every time they got the ball in hand, they kicked for position. On several occasions, Ollie Barkley, in particular, brought them deep into the Welsh '22', but the home line-out held firm to offset any real chance of a try. England did, however, edge in front in the 68th minute, when Wales brough an illegal end to one of the few periods in the game where England pieced together several phases of possession. Hodgson slotted the penalty between the posts fom 33 metres. The game lost any kind of structure after that, as tension drew a seriies of handling errors from both sides, preventing either from making any significant inroads into the others' half. Four minutes from the end, however, Gareth Thomas fired clever scrub kick to break the English line; Jason Robinson collected it, but then refused to release it when engulfed by Welsh wingers. Referee Steve Walsh awarded a penalty and, with Jones having been found wanting from distance on two previous occasions, Henson stepped to confidently strike it over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
