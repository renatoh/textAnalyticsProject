With its urgent, brooding, threateningly discordant strains, Greenwood's music adds ominous portent to this epic tale of oil found and innocence lost. Aurally evoking the biblical undertones of the title, the soundtrack of Paul Thomas Anderson's dark masterpiece confirms this extraordinary film-maker as possessing perhaps the finest ears in modern cinema. Adapted from Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood follows the corrosive career of Daniel Plainview, from straggle-handed miner to implacable oil baron for whom black gold runs thicker than blood. Explicitly foregrounding religion (in the form of Paul Dano's evangelical preacher) and territorial politics, the film could be interpreted as a timely parable on everything from the Iraq War to global warming. Yet there is something far more primal about the Conradian horrors which lurk within Plainview's heart of darkness. 'I hate most people,' he confesses in a rare moment of self-examination. 'I want to earn enough money that I can get away from everyone.' Bleak thoughts indeed, perfectly expressed in Daniel Day-Lewis's awards-sweeping performance. The single-disc DVD is a bare-bones affair, while the most interesting extra on the dual-disc 'Collector's Edition' is The Story of Petroleum, a Twenties silent short from the US Bureau of Mines chronicling the growth of the oil business. Black-and-white footage of workmen constructing derricks which (under 'exceptional' circumstances) are engulfed in torrents of oil are accompanied by more of Greenwood's haunting music, providing a genetic link with the main feature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
