The league is supposed to be entering a drama-filled final phase when it splits in two next weekend but yet another Celtic victory will save the upper echelons the bother of doing anything other than running up the white flag. Didier Agathe's goal in the 73rd minute means that all Celtic need do to win the league is defeat Dundee on Wednesday and St Mirren on Saturday; they are now on course to turn their last five games of the season into a series of exhibition matches. Dundee United's defeat of Rangers on Saturday meant Celtic were three steps from heaven yesterday. Now only two remain. \"It's tantalisingly close and we're in a fantastic position,\" said the Celtic manager Martin O'Neill who has transformed the club he only joined last summer. Aberdeen did their best to put a spanner in the machine. Typically unpredictable, they took the game to Celtic, especially up the flanks where the pace of Darren Mackie on the right looked capable of leaving Joos Valgaeren for dead, not least in the 62nd minute when he ran on to a David Rowson pass and drove inches wide. Robbie Winters on the left was often able to wrong-foot his man in similar style. Aberdeen's willing legs and unfazed close passing in midfield are also accompanied, however, by a capacity for lapses in concentration but in the first half they found Celtic in unusually forgiving mood. Normally quick to punish, as well as being resolutely difficult to break down, Celtic's assaults on Ryan Esson's goal were mostly wild. That Aberdeen were in one of their less generous moods was underlined by O'Neill's re-shaping of his Celtic team from 3-5-2 to 4-4-2 with 25 minutes left. It says something that Celtic's first corner did not come until the 55th minute, and then only when Henrik Larsson - breathing down the neck of any number of club scoring records - failed to put any curl to a dangerously positioned free-kick and was grateful for a deflection. But Celtic have an irresistible quality. When Aberdeen dallied in closing him down, Agathe turned sharply to fire with a low shot. With victory all but assured, Celtic grew in confidence, toying with their opponents, and Lubomir Moravcik's late shot hit the post. \u0095 Partick Thistle became the first senior club in Britain to gain promotion when they won 3-0 at Stirling Albion, thanks to a Peter Lindau hat-trick. They had needed only a single point to step up to the Bell's Scottish League First Division."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
