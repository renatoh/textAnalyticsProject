With votes still being counted, he laid out a paranoid fantasy of a vast leftwing conspiracy stealing the election from him, one fraudulent ballot at a time. For the media networks who cut away from Trump\u2019s speech after just a few minutes, it was all too easy to dismiss his lie-infested rant as the death rattle of a man whose political lifeblood was being drained from him in real time. You could almost say his speech was irrelevant, given that no one is above the law and he doesn\u2019t get to choose, no matter how charismatic he looks on TV. Except for three inconvenient truths: Trump will continue to be head of state of the most powerful nation on Earth until at least 20 January; 70 million Americans voted for him, of whom a portion is likely to be susceptible to his falsehoods; some 17m guns have been bought so far this year \u2013 the largest number in US history. Nor did this outpouring of baseless histrionics end with the president. The rightwing talkshow host Mark Levin called on Republican state lawmakers to bypass the vote entirely and declare Trump the winner no matter what the final count. Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist in the White House now facing charges for running a fraudulent scheme to build the Mexican border wall, told Fox News: \u201cDonald Trump won an overwhelming victory on Tuesday night. It\u2019s now time to be bold, we have got to stop playing games here.\u201d A few hours later Facebook permanently suspended one of Bannon\u2019s accounts after he suggested senior members of the Trump administration should be beheaded. Facebook also banned a group, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d, that popped up on its platform attracting within the first 24 hours some 350,000 members, a number of whom made \u201cworrying calls for violence\u201d. Joe Biden, assuming he is declared the next occupant of the Oval Office, is going to have to climb a steep and stony path before he can drag America back to anything resembling decency. For a moment it looked almost promising. Election day itself went more smoothly than many had expected, with little of the militia activity and intimidation that was hovering so menacingly in the wings. But in the days since, during the agonizingly prolonged period of counting, more ominous signs emerged. Trump supporters assembled in large crowds outside vote-counting centres in Phoenix, Arizona, and Detroit, Michigan, some bearing firearms. It\u2019s enough to generate the sense of a nation teetering on the edge. Human rights groups, whose focus normally falls on the likes of Myanmar or Saudi Arabia, are paying close attention. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious situation and it is getting worse,\u201d said Bob Goodfellow, interim executive director of Amnesty International USA. \u201cWe are worried about the immediate coming days, which are likely to be volatile.\u201d Amnesty research has found a steady escalation in political violence in the US. Between May and September, the human rights watchdog documented confrontations between protesters and counter-protests in 37 of the 50 states. The group is especially concerned about Trump\u2019s incendiary language as he attempts to cling to power. \u201cWe see President Trump continually engaging in rhetoric that threatens public safety and facilitates violence,\u201d Goodfellow said. As Biden contemplates forming an administration, he has more to worry about than just the next few days. There\u2019s also the sobering prospect of Trumpism living on even beyond its creator. The adoration that Trump has instilled in his millions of supporters, the fervor with which many appear to have bought his demagoguery and misinformation, are forces that show no sign of abating. The extraordinarily close outcome of the race in so many critical battleground states can only fire those emotions. The Guardian asked Roger Stone what he thought would become of the Maga movement under a Biden presidency. Would it fade away? Stone has skin in this game, it should be noted. In July his longtime friend, Trump, commuted his sentence for obstructing a congressional investigation. He is also legendary for the political dirty tricks he has pioneered since he began working as a teenager for Richard Nixon in the early 1970s (he has a tattoo of Nixon on his back). He can also claim to be the source of the rallying cry now being deployed by Trump \u2013 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d \u2013 which Stone coined back in 2016 as an attempt allegedly to intimidate minority voters during the battle with Hillary Clinton. But Stone is also a seasoned observer of rightwing political machinations, and as such is a credible analyst of what might become of the red-capped Trump fanatics. Far from disappearing, he believes, they are going to be encouraged and emboldened whatever the next few days and weeks might bring. \u201cThe movement is much larger than Donald Trump. The neocon establishment Republicans who think they will take control of the GOP are dreaming,\u201d he said. Stone went on: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s movement is stronger than ever. It is going to thrive, and the fight to make America great again is going to continue.\u201d That\u2019s a chilling prospect for a nascent Biden presidency. The Democrats are already having to digest the likelihood that they have failed to flip the US Senate, pending the outcome of two possible runoff elections in Georgia in January. Unless they win both those long-shot races, the Senate will probably be left in the deadeningly obstructionist hands of the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell. As Biden knows well from his eight years alongside Barack Obama, McConnell \u2013 dubbed the \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d for his impact on legislation \u2013 delights in nothing more than stymying Democratic presidents at every turn. David French, a prominent Republican critic of Trump, wrote in the Dispatch: \u201cThe underlying disease of American division and polarization remains. If anything, a divided government will cause it to intensify.\u201d That\u2019s the rosy prospect that lies ahead as Joe Biden inches ever closer to the highest office. A bright future looks within his grasp as president of the Disunited States of America. \u2022 The caption of the main image of this article was amended on 13 December 2020 to note that the broken hat model sculpture was by Connor Czora."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
