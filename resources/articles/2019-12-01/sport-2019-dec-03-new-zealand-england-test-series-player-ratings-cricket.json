Held one blinding catch at gully, to his credit, and deserves more time. Rory Burns 7 Made a slightly charmed half-century in his first innings and emerged from one of two streaky evening sessions with a competent second Test century. All three dismissals a case of giving it away slightly but has fighting qualities and appears to be settling in at this level. Joe Denly 5 Soaked up 323 balls in the first Test for scores of 74 and 35, looking impressively calm at the crease. Rather undid this good work in Hamilton, however, when nicking off early on the second evening and putting down a horror catch on the final day. Still waiting for a breakthrough performance. Joe Root 7 His tactics on the third day at Bay Oval, and two limp dismissals in the match, made England\u2019s cast-iron certainty he will be captain for the next two years look questionable. But a determined double-century in Hamilton reasserted a degree of authority and form before the team head to South Africa. Ben Stokes 5 Batted like a god first up, only to give it away on 91 and spark a costly collapse. Fell twice in the 20s thereafter and despite thundering in with the ball, picked up just two wickets, looking troubled by a knee problem at times. Dropping Watling (205) on 31 and Latham (105) on 66 will bug him most, but 2019 is still his year. Jos Buttler 4 It might have simply been a freak gym injury that ruled him out of Hamilton but after a taxing return behind the stumps, one followed by an 18-ball duck, eyebrows were still raised about Buttler\u2019s hardiness for the role. Had he shown the same confidence in Jack Leach\u2019s batting that Watling had in Santner, England\u2019s 353 all out might have been greater, too. Ollie Pope 5 Twice out chasing wide ones in the first Test but at least wised up, his 75 in the second putting on 193 with Root and showing his free-scoring tendencies can be reined in. Clearly loves wicketkeeping but a lack of experience \u2013 and thus a fully grooved technique \u2013 means his back-up status on tour should not be repeated. Sam Curran 5.5 Ever-willing for his captain with the ball and probably emerged with the most credit after those 201 gruelling overs in the Bay Oval dirt. Leading wicket-taker for England (a low bar) but his need for swing seemed to confuse the new-ball strategy. One punchy rearguard with the bat. Jofra Archer 4 A chastening first tour with two wickets at 104.50 runs apiece and the venomous 90mph\u2011plus spells seen during the summer only fleeting. No England bowler sent down more than his 82 overs \u2013 his economy was fine \u2013 and the hope is this alluring talent has learned plenty. Stuart Broad 5.5 Miserly but wicketless at Bay Oval, second time around Broad looked more the attack leader he was supposed to be with four wickets on another flat pitch and a creative ball to dislodge Watling. Hopefully more carry in South Africa gets his dander up. A second Test century continues to elude him. Jack Leach 4 Sent down 47 overs in one innings for two wickets without much assistance, was then left out for tactical reasons in Hamilton and spent the time off holed up in hospital with gastroenteritis. Talk of Moeen Ali\u2019s possible return suggests England\u2019s confidence in the left-armer is waning slightly. Chris Woakes 7 A fine return to the side with the ball as the pick of the England attack in Hamilton, with four wickets at 23.75 runs apiece and producing a beauty to remove Williamson first up. Edged behind for a duck during the hunt for quick runs but looks to have held his spot in the squad for South Africa. Zak Crawley 2 Emerged on debut at an unfamiliar No 6, struck a glorious on-drive that was stopped, had to dive to make his ground for his first run in Test cricket and then defended to extra cover sixth ball to nick off. Is among the fittest in the England squad but was slightly clumsy in the field in both innings. New Zealand Tom Latham 7 Expected to feature in most World XIs at the end of the year amid a surging run of form and, after a low-key start, showed his class here with 105 in the second Test that punished anything on his pads \u2013 and a drop on 66 by Stokes. Jeet Raval 3 A talking point for the local media ahead of the Australia series, with a frenzied display against Leach and little sense of permanency thereafter. His final innings, lbw second ball to Curran, betrayed a cluttered mind when declining to review a clear edge. Kane Williamson 7 A glossy half-century during the first Test played within cycling distance of his home \u2013 his preferred mode of transport for training \u2013 the ever-cool captain was undone by a beauty from Woakes but cashed in on England\u2019s late weariness with a century. Ross Taylor 6.5 Unleashed some typically violent cut shots during two cameos before truly fleshing out his stats with a century on the final day. Passed 7,000 Test runs along the way and his experience will be central to his side\u2019s chances across the Tasman. Henry Nicholls 4 Started well until struck on the head by a nasty short-ball from Archer in his first outing of the series, falling to Root\u2019s gentle off-breaks the next morning.Only batted once thereafter when bounced out by Curran; Australia will have taken note. Colin de Grandhomme 8 Central to the win at Bay Oval, providing thrifty support to the main seamers, twice wiping out Root in the match and making a fine 65 alongside Watling, reminding everyone he is more than just a crunching white-ball batsman. Injured thereafter. BJ Watling 9 Described himself as a \u201cvery limited\u201d batsman after his epic 205 in typically self-effacing Kiwi style, despite having joined Virat Kohli and Steve Smith as recent batsmen to leave England simply praying for his wicket. Strong follow-up in Hamilton and kept tidily. Mitchell Santner 8 The bespectacled Robin to Watling\u2019s Batman, showing gumption to survive a short-ball barrage and then delivering a maiden century as one half of the soul-destroying 261-run stand over 83.2 overs. Three wickets capped a perfect day but quiet thereafter. Tim Southee 7 Seven wickets at 34 despite little assistance. His three-wicket burst on the second morning at Bay Oval laid waste to England\u2019s encouraging start before breaking some resistance between Stokes and Denly on the final day. Trent Boult 4 Unable to exact revenge on England following the summer\u2019s World Cup heartbreak, picking up just one first-innings wicket before a side injury ended his series and left him struggling to be fit to face in time to face Australia. Neil Wagner 9 A remarkable bowler who sees a flat pitch in front of him and still summons up tireless spells of muscular fury for his captain. Most notably stepped up at the end of the first Test and ended with 13 wickets, six clear of the next best. Daryl Mitchell 6 Stepped up to fill the shoes of De Granhomme on his home ground with a patient 73 from 250 balls that showed off his penchant for a pull shot. Less effective than the man he replaced with the ball but did not shirk. Matt Henry 5 Preferred to Lockie Ferguson in Hamilton, much to the dismay of the locals, but held a solid line and length for economical figures and picked up a wicket when striking on the second evening with a fine delivery to nick off county colleague Denly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
