Taxes are rising, albeit stealthily, and bills are growing fatter even though it's said there's no inflation, while in real terms wages are decreasing. The streets are becoming invaded by traffic signs, traffic calmers, bollards, extended pavements that serve no use, speed and CCTV cameras, and bumps that cripple your car and jar your spine. The air is growing more polluted, the topsoil more useless, the greenhouse effect stronger, the weather more severe, food supply more uncertain, fresh water more scarce, terrorism more likely, disease more uncontainable and electronic viruses more prolific. Politicians are becoming more unreliable, true leaders there are none, and our cultural heroes are without substance. So is it surprising we see grim faces wherever we go - grim or so drunk they're almost slipping off the owner's face? I know I'm not alone in observing a worsening of the general mood. And I grant you, this is a slightly London-centric view, but I see the evidence in such fine conurbations as Nottingham and Manchester, no less. People are feeling the pressure. We may not consciously think about the above list of horrors, but our unconscious minds are working on it frantically to find some sense of balance in the midst of the cyclone. We may attempt self-distraction by getting absorbed in mass media-driven culture but are inevitably left wanting for substance. Never has the style and delivery been so slick, never the content so vapid. Not that I'm having a go - Justin Timberlake is a talented man and David Beckham's handsome, it's true. I could even concede some possible social value in reality TV, but it's not going anywhere near nourishing the soul. And that's what it is - what I see - people's souls crying out for nourishment. And yes, I confess there have been moments on boarding, say, a crowded tube when I've almost succumbed to the dark view - almost forgotten that I hold that very nourishment in my own hands, as you do yourself. And right there and then, standing as the tube rattles along, I access the love within and send it in a wide-arching stream, under someone's armpit and out into the carriage. In that moment, I cease to see the surface grimness, hardness, selfishness and overall twistedness of spirit in those around me. Instead, I see the vulnerable child within each and feel deep compassion for one and all. To report a discernable shift of atmosphere would be subjective on my part, but I see a general softening of the ambience at once - if only within me. In any case, I believe love you send out always reaches its target and has an effect even if you can't see it at the time. The point is, it balances me out and prevents me getting despondent about the human race and my place in it, as I'm sure it will you if an attack of the gloomies comes on. The method involves nothing more complex or saintly than relaxing your chest, letting go of all the unnecessary tension you were unconsciously holding there, dropping your breathing down into your belly, breathing freely and allowing your natural human warmth - warmth that becomes palpable and surprisingly abundant as soon as you do so - to emanate from you in invisible waves that engulf everyone present, or if you're alone, everyone you think of. It may not produce instantly recognisable results in the external world, but it will get you back in a trice on an even keel, better prepared for the next round of slings and arrows. Most importantly, it's incredibly self-empowering to acknowledge you hold the key to reducing human suffering in your hands at this very moment, and all you need do is relax."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
