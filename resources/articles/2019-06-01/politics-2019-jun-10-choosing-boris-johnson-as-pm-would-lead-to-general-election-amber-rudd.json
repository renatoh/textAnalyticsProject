The work and pensions secretary, who has announced she is backing Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, to succeed Theresa May, criticised Johnson\u2019s trenchant attitude towards leaving the EU on 31 October, saying: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not enough if you haven\u2019t got a plan behind it.\u201d Promises by Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey to leave without a deal if, as seems likely, the EU refuses to renegotiate the UK\u2019s departure deal, would be blocked by MPs and end up triggering an election, Rudd said. Asked if a vote for a no-deal candidate was, in effect, a vote for an early election, Rudd told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIn my view it is.\u201d She said: \u201cMembers of parliament will find a way to stop no deal and I think that any aspiring leader needs to factor that in. \u201cI think there could be an election \u2013 parliament is a very creative place, and with the assistance of an activist Speaker there will be a way that MPs will find in order to have their voice heard.\u201d After May formally tendered her resignation on Friday, Hunt, Raab, the former Brexit secretary, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will launch their leadership bids on Monday. Nominations for the post close at 5pm, by which point candidates must have gained at least eight nominations to proceed to the first round of voting. With 11 MPs standing, the expectation is that some will fail to reach the threshold. Johnson is the clear favourite, with other leading contenders including Hunt, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, and Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Gove\u2019s chances are regarded to have been badly hit after he revealed he took cocaine while he was working as a journalist and advocating robust measures against drug use. Rudd said her decision to back Hunt came after the One Nation group of Tory MPs, of which she is part, held hustings events for candidates last week. \u201cBy the end of that double two-hour session it was clear to me that Jeremy was going to be the best person to solve the impasse,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cWe need somebody who faces up to the challenges that we have, who\u2019s not just going to say: \u2018Believe in Britain, it\u2019ll be fine\u2019, but has the experience and the plan to try and heal those divisions and actually bring us to Brexit as soon as possible.\u201d While Johnson had \u201cmany great things\u201d about him, Rudd said, his plans for Brexit were too vague: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not enough to say, we\u2019re definitely leaving by 31 October without addressing how you\u2019re going to resolve it.\u201d She also criticised Johnson\u2019s plan, announced overnight, to slash the higher rate of income tax: \u201cIf you want to badge yourself as a one-nation Conservative you focus on tax cuts and investment in infrastructure to help the lowest paid and people in most difficulty in all parts of this country. That\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Among the outsiders standing for the role is Andrea Leadsom, who recently resigned as leader of the Commons. While she has so far received only four public pledges of support, Leadsom said she was confident of gaining the eight needed. She also expressed doubt at Johnson\u2019s tax plans, saying he had not taken account of the difficulties of passing legislation without an outright Conservative majority: \u201cI think in reality, in this parliament, it would be impossible to actually get wholesale tax changes through.\u201d Leadsom termed her Brexit proposal a \u201cmanaged exit\u201d, a variant on no deal in which she would persuade the EU and parliament to agree some basic issues over citizens\u2019 rights and other areas. However, she dismissed the idea floated by Raab of proroguing, or suspending, parliament in order to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal departure in October. \u201cWe live in a parliamentary democracy, and bringing the Queen in and trying to do something that shuts down our parliamentary democracy would be entirely wrong.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
