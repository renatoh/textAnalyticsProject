But in the space of six weeks, both women died. Sulli, 25, took her own life in October after years of online abuse. Her close friend Goo, who was the same age, had just completed a solo tour of Japan when her body was found at her home in Seoul last weekend alongside a note that police said indicated she had been feeling \u201cpessimistic\u201d. Goo had made enemies of online commenters and the tabloid media for taking action against an ex-boyfriend who had allegedly threatened her with revenge porn. Sulli had attracted hate for her feminism and public battle with depression. Both refused to play the roles demanded of them by many of their compatriots. \u201cSome female idols have been ostracised for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated, patriarchal South Korean society,\u201d Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist, told the Associated Press. Their deaths, along with a recent sexual abuse scandal, have put the industry under unprecedented scrutiny over its treatment of women, many of whom are spotted in their teens and subjected to an unforgiving regime of song and dance training that leaves no room for everyday pleasures. They also pose uncomfortable questions about the toxic mix of misogyny and taboos over mental illness that experts say is ruining lives beyond the highly pressured confines of the music industry. Sulli was the target of online abuse for not wearing a bra, for live-streaming an innocent night out drinking with a friend, for addressing older male colleagues by their first names and \u2013 her most egregious \u201ccrime\u201d, it seems \u2013 for describing herself as a feminist. \u201cSouth Korean society is holding on to the idea that men must be respected and women are not deserving of respect, or at least not much,\u201d said Ryu Sang-ho, a neurologist at Haedong hospital in Busan. \u201cThe media feed off that, so it\u2019s no surprise that the public don\u2019t have any sense of empathy towards these women.\u201d A year before her death, Goo had taken her ex-boyfriend Choi Jong-bum to court after he threatened to release a video of the couple having sex. Choi was convicted of assault and blackmail and given a suspended 18-month prison sentence, but he was cleared of illicit filming. Both sides appealed and the case had not been settled at the time of Goo\u2019s death. There was little public sympathy for Goo during the trial, with the singer attracting a barrage of online abuse and lurid tabloid stories over her violation of an immutable law of K-pop stardom: to appear at once innocent and sexually available. \u201cThe topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,\u201d said Tae-sung Yeum, a psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest psychiatric clinic. \u201cThere\u2019s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.\u201d There are signs that attitudes are changing. Goo\u2019s death sparked a petition to the website of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, calling for stronger punishments for abusive online comments. It attracted more than 20,000 signatures in less than a day. The national assembly will soon begin debating a bill nicknamed Sulli\u2019s law to combat online abuse. But that is treating only part of the South Korean mental health malaise that has been brought into sharp focus by Sulli and Goo\u2019s deaths. It is no coincidence that a decade in which several celebrities have taken their own lives, including the male singer Kim Jong-hyun, coincided with a rise in mental illness and suicides throughout South Korean society. The country has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of suicide, which is among the leading causes of death among people under 40. Taboos about mental illness prevent many people from seeking help. K-pop stars, like millions of other South Koreans, are discouraged from seeking help for depression, which is still viewed as a failure of moral character. \u201cThe blame lies with South Korean society in general,\u201d said Ryu. \u201cMany people with mental health issues are reluctant to take medication for fear of being seen as weak-minded. Mental health problems should be treated in the same way as a common cold. South Korean society needs to catch up.\u201d Additional reporting by Nemo Kim in Seoul.
