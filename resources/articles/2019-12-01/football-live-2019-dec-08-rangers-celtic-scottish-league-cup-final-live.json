It\u2019s been a blast. Here\u2019s your match report. Bye! Scott Brown\u2019s medal has fallen off its ribbon. \u201cI\u2019ve lost it already,\u201d he admits. To be fair, he\u2019s probably got enough already. Glasgow weather latest: Jonny Hayes is visibly shivering as he takes part in Celtic\u2019s victory lap. More from Neil Lennon, who to his great credit is honest and generous in victory: Fraser was awesome today, and he needed to be, because first half we were so flat. We\u2019ve been playing brilliantly, scoring a lot of goals, but we just looked really off it first half. You have to give Rangers credit for that. But we galvanised ourselves, showed a lot of mental strength, scored a great goal and had a chance to make it two. It doesn\u2019t stop here. We\u2019ve got a lot of games between now and the end of the month to forge ahead in the league, but that\u2019s a first trophy in the cabinet. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen less deserving cup final winners. That their goal was offside is just the icing on a very bitter cake for Rangers. Anyway, here\u2019s Neil Lennon: I\u2019m delighted. Disappointed with the way we played at times, because that\u2019s not the standard we set ourselves. We had to ride our luck, there\u2019s no question of that. I shook the Rangers players\u2019 hands because they made the final a good spectacle. But we\u2019ve come through it again. We\u2019re absolutely an amazing team. That\u2019s 10 major trophies in a row. It\u2019s a brilliant day. To go down to 10 men, and the resilience we showed ... I thought we were better with 10 men than we were with 11. Scott Brown lifts the trophy skywards, and as fireworks fly off the Hampden Park roof, yet another Celtic trophy celebration commences. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be one of the all time great goalkeeping performances/clean sheets,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cFraser Forster would be as well retiring now, he\u2019ll never beat that. Without him, Rangers would have won 5-1, at least. Fair play to Celtic though, took their chance. Rangers didn\u2019t.\u201d I refer the honourable gentleman to my previous answer. I think most of Forster\u2019s saves were entirely straightforward, but there were just so many of them that eventually Rangers\u2019 self-belief drained out of them, as if they felt by the end it was barely worth them giving Forster another opportunity to show off. Neil Lennon strolls about in front of the Celtic fans, 10 fingers raised. This is the most remarkable victory, won with an offside goal, their only shot on target. Rangers were fantastic but for Morelos, who could barely do anything right. He had his chances, but inevitably either shot straight at Forster, or high, or wide. Forster made one good save, from a bouncing header, but everything else was pretty easy for him. Fraser Forster, man of the match, has a quick chat: Just went my way today. I\u2019ll take that. Just buzzing for the lads, buzzing for everyone at the club, buzzing for the fans. It just shows how clinical we are. It\u2019s something special. We played some terrible football, but we\u2019ve won the game and as long as you win a final, that\u2019s all that matters. 90+7 mins: It\u2019s all over! Celtic have been pummelled from first to last, and won anyway! 90+7 mins: Kent runs down the right. He has Defoe and Morelos to aim at, but can\u2019t find either of them. Is that it? 90+7 mins: Into stoppage time at the end of stoppage time. 90+6 mins: Celtic win a free-kick in their own area. Morelos vaguely touched someone, a pretty harsh decision. Forster goes down. It\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s bothering him, and eventually, after the physio has come on for a while, it transpires that nothing is. 90+5 mins: Rangers have had 16 shots to Celtic\u2019s five, seven on target to Celtic\u2019s one, 11 corners to Celtic\u2019s one. They trail by a goal with 90 seconds to play ... 90+3 mins: Close! Arfield passes to Morelos, who is played onside by Ajer. He spins onto it and shoots across goal, but the ball zips inches wide of the far post! 90+2 mins: Another terrible Barisic cross. Embarisic, more like. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time. There\u2019ll be six minutes of it! It\u2019s not over yet! 89 mins: A better cross from Barisic. It heads towards Morelos, who flings himself to the turf rather than win the header. Johnston is on his shoulders, but Morelos was certainly ready to go down. On commentary, Chris Sutton rages that Morelos \u201cshould be booked\u201d for \u201ctrying to con the referee\u201d, but actually on the replays I see a pretty clear push. 88 mins: They do indeed waste that corner. The ball is won back and ends up with Barisic on the left, who hits a hugely embarrassing cross that flies over everyone and out for a throw-in. 87 mins: Jermain Defoe touches the ball! The ball comes in from the right, and he and Jullien fling themselves at it at the near post. It hits both, and Rangers have another corner to waste. 85 mins: Arfield blasts a shot high from too far out. Rangers, despite having an extra man, have not been the same since the penalty save. 83 mins: All the physios are on. Ajer is down for Celtic, and Helander for Rangers. Katic replaces the latter, but Celtic are clean out of substitutions. 81 mins: Rangers win another corner, their 10th. It is no more effective than the previous nine. 79 mins: Celtic put the ball out of play so that Jullien can receive treatment. Rangers refuse to return the ball from the throw-in, keeping it instead and launching an attack that culminates in Morelos thrashing a wild shot high of goal from the edge of the area. 78 mins: Jullien goes down, apparently in pain. Turns out Morelos trod on his heel. Was it deliberate? It\u2019s hard to tell from the replays, but he certainly didn\u2019t try to get out of the way. 77 mins: There\u2019s definitely another goal in this game, which is getting wilder by the minute. A cross from the left is just cleared before Edouard can poke it in, and a couple of seconds later McGregor is booked for a foul on Barisic. 74 mins: Brandon Barker replaces the recently-booked Joe Aribo. 71 mins: Aribo is booked. Sky\u2019s commentary team thinks it was the least he deserves, but it looked to me like he was guilty of doing not very much to a wildly overreacting Jonny Hayes. 71 mins: Jermain Defoe replaces Kamara for Rangers. They have sorely needed his finishing smarts here. 69 mins: What a chance for Celtic to win this! Edouard wins the ball just inside Rangers\u2019 half, spots Johnston sprinting into space to his left and plays him in. Johnston runs into the area, draws McGregor, and sidefoots wide! 67 mins: From a half-cleared corner Jack has a shot which is half-cleared back to him, and his second shot takes probably a couple of deflections on its way into Forster\u2019s arms. 66 mins: Celtic make a tactical change, taking James Forrest off, and bringing Nir Bitton on. 64 mins: Morelos hammers his penalty low and vaguely leftwards, and Forster goes the right way and saves it! It\u2019s a rubbish penalty - if Forster guessed right, he couldn\u2019t fail to save it! 63 mins: The ball ricochets into the path of Morelos inside the penalty area. Frimpong finds himself behind the Rangers forward, and pulls him back! The referee points to the spot, and brings out the red card! 63 mins: Rangers have had six shots on target so far. Celtic have just scored with their first. 61 mins: That\u2019s a travesty in so many ways. Rangers have been massively dominant, they should have had a penalty a few minutes ago, and now they\u2019re trailing to a goal that shouldn\u2019t have stood. Football, eh? Edouard comes on, wins a free kick out on the left, and as it comes in three Celtic players are offside. Jullien, third of the trio, sidefoots a volley in! Somehow they lead! 59 mins: Edouard is now on, and Lewis Morgan is off. 57 mins: Celtic are about to bring on Eduoard. They surely can\u2019t survive much more of this onslaught. 56 mins: Another save! Rangers win another free-kick on the right. It\u2019s lfited into the area, and Morelos meets it at the far post, heads it into the turf and as it bounces towards the net Forster flings out his left glove and pushes it to safety! That\u2019s the best save of the game so far. 55 mins: Jonny Hayes has turned into a one-man free-kick dispensor, sliding in recklessly on the left and then barging Morelos down on the right. 53 mins: Brown fouled Morelos inside the penalty area a couple of minutes back, no doubt about it. So much was going on at the time that the referee entirely missed it, and VAR is not a thing here. 52 mins: Now a low ball comes in from the left and causes panic in the Celtic backline. Aribo looks set to tap it in at the far post when Forster gets a foot to it! 51 mins: A chance for Rangers! The ball rolls to Morelos, whose shot from an unpromising angle to the left of goal rolls across the goalline and wide! 50 mins: The first shot on goal of the second half comes from Tavernier, just outside the penalty area, but it\u2019s not his finest, and flies well off target. 48 mins: A bit of midfield-based sparring to start the second period, with neither defence much threatened thus far. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! They\u2019re off! The players are back out and ready to rock. This has to be decided in the next 45 minutes (or the half-hour after that, or failing that, penalties). Let\u2019s do this! Apparently Mohamed Elyounoussi is being taken off at the break, and 20-year-old Mikey Johnson will come on. A massively encouraging half for Rangers, but can they sustain this intensity for the full 90 minutes? And can Alfredo Morelos locate his shooting boots at half-time? The answers to these and other questions are soon to be revealed. 45+3 mins: Rangers have had eight shots to Celtic\u2019s two, five on target to Celtic\u2019s none, and five corners to Celtic\u2019s one. But it\u2019s goalless at the break. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be two minutes or so. 44 mins: Rangers are controlling the end of the half as emphatically as they controlled the start. And most of the middle. Tavernier has a decent crossing chance, but for some reason decides instead to pass straight to Christie, who clears. 41 mins: The first booking of the final goes to Glen Kamara, who having been beaten by Frimpong hauls him back by the waist. 40 mins: What a chance for Rangers! Morelos is played in, but I think he suspects he\u2019s offside (he isn\u2019t - Hayes was behind him and goalside) and thus doesn\u2019t really commit to the finish, which again hits Forster. 38 mins: Any suggestion that the rain had stopped was laughably wide of the mark, incidentally. We\u2019re having a slight pre-half-timely lull. 35 mins: It looks like Ryan Jack has fully recovered. Morelos gives away a free kick for deliberately jumping into a defender, which he\u2019s done a couple of times already. 32 mins: Celtic are starting to threaten more regularly. They launch a threatening break, which ends when Morgan is brilliantly challenged by Jack. But the Rangers player\u2019s studs catch in the turf as he comes in to win the ball, and he\u2019s now receiving treatment to his knee. 28 mins: Chance for Rangers! It\u2019s a long pass down the right, and Morelos gets to it first, runs past Ajer, who commits himself foolishly, cuts into the box and, with no one particularly better placed infield, blasts a shot at Forster! 25 mins: Celtic win their first corner, and Ajer wins the header, but it goes well over the bar. 24 mins: Hayes finds some space on the left, but his cross goes straight to a blue shirt. Rangers need to convert their dominance into goals before Celtic wake up. 23 mins: Another optimistic Morelos shot, and this time Forster makes an easy save. 22 mins: Another corner, another Rangers header, another goal kick. 21 mins: Morelos blasts a shot at goal from wide on the left, and Forster makes a complete hash of the save, letting the ball roll underneath him, but Hayes is first to the loose ball and clears! 20 mins: Celtic do look like they can\u2019t really be arsed with a cup final this afternoon. It\u2019s as if they feel a bit put out at having to play football on a day when Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is on the TV, and haven\u2019t really been able to get over it. 16 mins: Tavernier\u2019s corner is headed by Goldson straight into a defender. 15 mins: Another Rangers corner. Celtic don\u2019t seem to have an outlet here, but they are yet to concede a genuine goalscoring chance. 14 mins: Shot ... and saved! Jack smacks the ball goalwards from 25 yards and it\u2019s dipping beautifully into the top corner until Forster tips it over! 13 mins: It might have actually stopped raining. [inevitable obvious pun dept adds: Rangers are still pouring forward, mind.] 10 mins: Celtic do a thing. It\u2019s not a very good thing, but it must still be categorised as an attack. Morgan is found inside the penalty area, but his first-time shot from an unpromising position is unpromising. 8 mins: Another Celtic corner, but it\u2019s a rubbish one. It loops over the six-yard box, and though Rangers keep the ball they don\u2019t do much with it. 5 mins: It\u2019s been 100% pure Rangers so far. Now Barisic gets down the left, but his cross isn\u2019t great, Arfield doesn\u2019t really commit to the header and the ball ends up bouncing off his back and behind. 3 mins: Now they win a free-kick on the right, and again Goldson wins the header but this time it has neither power nor accuracy. Goal kick. 2 mins: And now an early corner for Rangers. Jullien beats Helander to the header, sending the ball looping into the air, and Forster pushes it behind for another corner. This time Goldson wins it, and thumps a header wide! 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Rangers get the ball rolling, and promptly smack it straight into touch! An email! \u201cJust to pick up on Ewan\u2019s article yesterday, yes, no questioning that Rangers have improved and in doing so have forced us to up our game too, but to say that we Celtic fans fear them is a bit of a stretch,\u201d writes Tom Conniffe. \u201cRespect them as a team, sure, but no great fear. We have better quality right across the park and on our day should deal with them straightforwardly. Of course football can produce surprises, which is why we love it, but they rely largely on a single gameplan - go wide and cross to Morelos - that can be nullified if we keep our concentration. And we have a plan b and c on the bench in French Eddy, Rogic and Johnston, that they just don\u2019t.\u201d Confident talk there. Now Celtic just need to go and win it. The players are in the tunnel! And out they come, as jets of fire burst skywards! The pre-match entertainment is in full swing. Currently Ally McCoist and Chris Sutton are taking turns to wave the trophy at supporters of the teams they once represented, while fans of the other lot boo. And it\u2019s still raining. I\u2019m counting two coats, some extremely thick gloves, a scarf and a bonus plastic poncho here. Your Glasgow weather report in a single image: Neil Lennon says Edouard \u201ccame in yesterday and said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough in himself to start the game\u201d. His players, he says, are quiet and focused on winning 10 major trophies in a row: \u201cI might give them a few words of motivation, but the majority have been here and done it before, so it\u2019s nice and calm in there at the moment.\u201d Steven Gerrard says Steven Davis had \u201cno chance\u201d of making this game, and will miss two or three games with a calf injury. Also: Without giving too much away we want to get quality from the sides. You know what dressing-rooms are like now, they have this music on blasting, it\u2019s like a nightclub in there. They\u2019re in a good place, they just need to go and grasp it now. We\u2019ve got to defend well, first and foremost, and when the game presents itself to us to show how good we are from an attacking point of view. It\u2019s important we play the game, rather than the occasion. We have to be the best Rangers if we want to win this trophy. Weather latest: it is absolutely ratting down in Glasgow. The pitch is \u201cabsolutely saturated\u201d and it\u2019s unlikely to stop any time soon. It\u2019s probably wise to establish at this stage what would happen should the scores be level after 90 minutes. Here are the relevant regulations: Basis of Competition 4.5 In all rounds, other than the First Round, the Competition shall be conducted on a \u2018knockout\u2019 basis with the winner being the Club or club with the greater number of goals at full-time. If the scores are equal at full time or no goals have been scored, an extra thirty minutes (15 minutes each way) of extra time will be played (\u201cExtra Time\u201d) and, if the scores are still equal or still no goals have been scored at the end of Extra Time, the winner shall be determined by taking Penalty Kicks. 4.6 If Penalty Kicks are required, the Match referee determines which goal will be used as follows: 4.6.1 if the Match referee determines that either goal could be used for the Penalty Kicks, then, in the presence of the two captains, the referee shall toss a coin to decide which goal will be used; or 4.6.2 if for reasons of safety/security, condition of the field of play, lighting or other reason, the Match referee determines that a particular goal shall be used for the Penalty Kicks, such decision shall be final and require no justification. 4.7 Following the procedure set out in Regulation 4.6, the Match referee shall toss a coin and the Club/club that wins the toss shall decide whether to take the first or second Penalty Kick. The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them. Steven Davis is the notable absentee from the Rangers side, while Odsonne Edouard is fit enough only for the Celtic bench: Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Helander, Barisic, Aribo, Jack, Kamara, Arfield, Morelos, Kent. Subs: Defoe, Ojo, Foderingham, Flanagan, Katic, Barker, Stewart. Celtic: Forster, Frimpong, Ajer, Jullien, Hayes, McGregor, Brown, Forrest, Christie, Elyounoussi, Morgan. Subs: Gordon, Bitton, Rogic, Johnston, Ntcham, Edouard, Bolingoli Mbombo. Referee: William Collum. Hello world! Celtic play Rangers in the final of the competition currently known as the Betfred Cup, for Rangers a first League Cup final since they beat these very opponents 2-1 in 2010-11. Celtic have won this pot in four of the last five seasons, beating Dundee United, Aberdeen, Motherwell and Aberdeen again by an aggregate score of 8-0 in those finals, but Old Firm games since Steven Gerrard\u2019s appointment by Rangers have tended to be close, there are only two points between them in the league table and this looks very much like an anything-could-happen situation. Here\u2019s Ewan Murray\u2019s preview: It would be natural for Celtic supporters to have spent recent days in a state of apprehension. For the prospect of their domestic dominance being halted by their Old Firm rivals Rangers is galling. Were Aberdeen, Dundee United or Motherwell to end Celtic\u2019s consecutive trophy haul, which currently stands at nine, there would be joy for the underdog and widespread shock. If Rangers break the spell, the mutual impact would be considerable. For all that Celtic should be the favourites heading into Sunday\u2019s Scottish League Cup final, a Hampden Park showpiece \u2013 likely to be more intense, and bitter, than most knockout football \u2013 supplies no guarantees.
