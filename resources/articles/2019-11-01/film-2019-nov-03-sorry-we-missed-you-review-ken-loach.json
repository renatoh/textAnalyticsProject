We call it on-boarding. You don\u2019t work for us \u2013 you work with us.\u201d It\u2019s a prime example of the doublespeak that underwrites today\u2019s gig-economy culture, brilliantly captured by Paul Laverty\u2019s justifiably embittered script. As sold to hard-grafting Ricky Turner (Kris Hitchen), it\u2019s an opportunity to become \u201cthe master of your own destiny\u201d \u2013 a self-employed franchise-owner, freed from wage slavery (there are only \u201cfees\u201d) in a brave new world in which everything \u201cis your choice\u201d. Yet despite Ricky\u2019s determination to grab this opportunity and make it work for him and his family, he\u2019s been sold a lie \u2013 all he\u2019s really being freed from are basic workers\u2019 rights. Before the drama is over, that hollow declaration of choice will come back to haunt Ricky, painfully revealed as nothing more than an enslaving illusion. From the outset we know where this is going, as the costs immediately start piling up. First there\u2019s the van, which requires a \u00a31,000 deposit, raised by selling the car that Ricky\u2019s wife, Abby (Debbie Honeywood), needs for her own work. She\u2019s already overstretched \u2013 an agency care-worker in an uncaring world, shuttling endlessly between too-short appointments with the elderly and infirm, struggling to live up to her golden rule: \u201cTreat them like your mam.\u201d Then there are the costs of the job; the hundreds of pounds of fines incurred if Ricky doesn\u2019t show up on time; the thousands he owes if he loses his parcels or his tracker, even when he gets robbed. More profound is the cost to Ricky\u2019s family life, as he and Abby find their every waking hour devoured by work, unable to spend much-needed time with the kids: teenage graffiti artist Seb (Rhys Stone) who is increasingly skipping school, to the exhausted anger of his father; and smart young daughter, Liza Jane (Katie Proctor), who sees her parents\u2019 pain and desperately wants things to be \u201cthe way they were\u2026\u201d Unfussily photographed by Robbie Ryan, this increasingly gruelling (and somewhat schematic) drama plays out under the slate-grey skies of Newcastle, the setting for Loach and Laverty\u2019s superior I, Daniel Blake, to which this acts as a companion piece. It\u2019s portrayed as an unforgiving urban sprawl, wherein hardworking people can get caught in a suffocating spiral of despair. Time and again, scenes of back-breaking struggle end with the screen fading to black, as if the film itself is simply too tired to go on or hanging its head in empathetic shame. What a relief it is when a crack in the clouds allows a ray of sun to shine through, however briefly. A scene of the family sharing a takeaway curry (and Ricky misjudging a vindaloo) provokes giggling delight, both on and off screen. A moment of gentle hair-brushing is lent a note of heartbreaking sweetness by the sung strains of the old ballad Goodnight Irene. Most significantly, a day of father-daughter bonding recalls the outdoor wonder of Loach\u2019s ground-breaking 1969 feature Kes. Yet the latter comes with a sting in its tail \u2013 a harsh reminder that no good deed goes unpunished in a world in which \u201ceverything is out of whack\u201d. \u201cThis decides who lives and who dies,\u201d says Maloney (self-declared \u201cpatron saint of nasty bastards\u201d) about the electronic scanner that records and dictates Ricky\u2019s every movement as he races to meet deadlines \u2013 and gets attacked by dogs, insulted by customers or beaten up by muggers. \u201cMaking the box happy is everything.\u201d And therein lies the awful truth \u2013 that Ricky, whose dreams of house ownership were crushed by the 2008 crash, is now answerable not to himself, but to a heartless, soulless machine. As always with Loach and Laverty\u2019s work, the devil is in the detail \u2013 those incidental elements that lend an unmistakable ring of truth to the wider drama, even as it moves inexorably towards melodrama. Whether it\u2019s Ricky being given a bottle to piss in to save time on the road, or Abby dabbing camphor under her nostrils before entering a potentially pungent home, we believe in these characters and the situations in which they find themselves. Is it fair to want more light and shade from a film whose downward trajectory seems so defined by the darkness of the reality it depicts? As Ricky discovers, this road only leads one way and in today\u2019s socioeconomic environment, there\u2019s precious little evidence of light at the end of the tunnel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
