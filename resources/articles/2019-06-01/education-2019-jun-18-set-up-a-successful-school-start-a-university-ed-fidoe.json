What next? Start a university, of course", "bodyText": "Ed Fidoe, co-founder of School 21, an \u201coutstanding\u201d free school in east London, has spotted a problem. To solve it, he\u2019s opening a university. It all began in 2012 when he, together with Tony Blair\u2019s former aide Peter Hyman, opened School 21 to give pupils \u201csuperpower\u201d communication skills, prompting a glowing Ofsted report two years later. Fidoe wanted pupils to create \u201cworks of value\u201d for their communities, rather than wait until they had jobs. But despite top GCSE results, Fidoe was worried. \u201cI started to feel quite frustrated that even though we were doing all these things with the pupils, none of this was really going to get recognition at university.\u201d His solution is the London Interdisciplinary School, a new university which, if it gets the go-ahead from the Office for Students, will open in September next year with 120 students on its bachelor of arts and sciences (BASc) degree. It is currently operating out of offices in Aldgate, but Fidoe expects to announce its permanent address in the next three months. The aim is to link the academic and entrepreneurial, with students doing paid work placements with corporations and startups. Virgin and McKinsey (Fidoe\u2019s former workplace) are on board, as is the social work scheme Frontline and the Metropolitan police. The plan is to sign up 50 organisations. An extra 10 weeks will be added to term time for this. Interdisciplinary degrees aren\u2019t entirely new \u2013 University College London launched an arts and sciences BASc programme in 2012, and according to its director of programmes, almost all students do work placements, too. Combined degrees are growing in popularity. Research by Unifrog, a careers platform, reveals \u201cliberal arts\u201d degrees \u2013 combining humanities and sciences \u2013 shot up to become the most popular shortlisted subject for the 139,400 year 12 pupils using the platform, pushing medicine into second place. But Fidoe\u2019s plan, headed by Prof Carl Gombrich, who set up the UCL course, has some interesting distinctions. Learning will begin with a \u201cproblem\u201d. According to Graham Woodgate, acting director of UCL\u2019s BASc, only his \u201cmore adventurous\u201d students tackle a complex global issue. But at LIS, \u201cproblems\u201d are the starting point. Childhood obesity, malaria, palm oil supply chains, knife crime and more will be taught by 12 faculty heads using maths, engineering, anthropology, psychology, history, neuroscience and environmental science, and include research and campaign methods. Students will tackle a dozen problems in three years, and work placements should reflect that. For instance, the Metropolitan police wants them to help solve knife crime. Mary Curnock Cook, former head of Ucas, says the problem-focused curriculum at LIS can uniquely link together different disciplines. Fidoe says: \u201cToo few people can grapple confidently in these areas, because the last time they dealt with that breadth they were 16 years old.\u201d LIS is also unusual in having no A-level requirements; it will consider grades but also scout for teamwork and creativity during assessment days. \u201cThe goal is to have a student body representative of the country \u2013 the Russell Group are nowhere near that,\u201d says Fidoe. Eighty pupils have attended two open days. At the first, 90% were state-educated, and 10% of those were on free school meals. Given its career-focused curriculum, the LIS may succeed in recruiting disadvantaged pupils where many universities have failed. \u201cIf we can create a broader model for admissions other universities can follow, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d says Fidoe. The LIS will also not enter the Research Excellence Framework, which rates universities for their research, as its focus is on students. Given the \u00a39,000 tuition fee, staff will be chosen for their ability to deliver a \u201ctransformational teaching experience\u201d, says Fidoe. It will enter the new Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Frameworks. Investors, which include Innocent Smoothies and Funding Circle, have provided cash for three years. Fidoe is hazy on how the university will demonstrate its success, but says it will check \u201cwhere students are in five, 10 years\u2019 time\u201d. There may, though, be stiff competition for students: UCL\u2019s BASc began with 80 students and recruited 148 this year, but Fidoe wants to fill 120 places straight off. In the same year his doors open, UCL is launching an MASc, an interdisciplinary master\u2019s. At UCL, Woodgate criticises the lack of language study in the LIS programme, and says his students learn one of 10 languages.. Will global problems really be solved only in English, he asks? On the other hand, he says, \u201cUCL isn\u2019t going to have those intensive relationships with companies. LIS will do what it will do, and it will be different.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
