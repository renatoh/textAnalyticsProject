Get, previously known as Qnect, is an app built for university societies and clubs to facilitate payments for events and merchandise. The app operates in four countries with 159,000 active student users, and 453 clubs using it. A user on Reddit reported over the weekend that after looking up their own club they were able to get access to other users\u2019 data, including name, email, date of birth, Facebook ID and phone numbers, through the company\u2019s search function, API. They said they were able to send requests for data without special tokens provided for legitimate access to the service, meaning anyone could request the information. In response on Sunday, Get posted on its website that it had made a change to prevent that happening and had begun telling organisations about the potential breach. The company said it was reviewing the API calls to see what data might have been accessed. \u201cIf we become aware of any specific information which has been compromised we will notify the organisations, their members and report a breach,\u201d the company said. \u201cNo personal payment information is stored in Get\u2019s databases and payments are processed by a secure third-party payment processor, responsible for many of the world\u2019s online transactions.\u201d Guardian Australia has attempted to contact Get about the breach. The user who found the breach told Guardian Australia in a message over Reddit that they had decided to remain anonymous in case Get had a negative response to the finding, but had tried several times to contact the company. \u201cI\u2019ve reached out to Get around six times over the weekend, but haven\u2019t heard back. I did read their response, but it\u2019s sadly a non-response,\u201d they said. \u201cLocking the service down is definitely a good first step, but there is no genie back in the bottle (the oldest dataset I saw was 16 months old), and that data is already out in the wild \u2013 the least they can do is let people know what was released so that people can take steps to protect themselves.\u201d Get rebranded last year following a data breach that resulted in members of societies and clubs using the platform being threatened with having their data released by a hacking group, unless then-Qnect paid the hackers in bitcoin. Co-founder Daniel Liang said at the time that media had blown up in the incident, and the company had been \u201cvery transparent\u201d. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about students\u2019 data and payments, it\u2019s a sensitive thing. We always kept our community up to date, we were very transparent and very clear with them,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the office of the Australian information commissioner \u2013 who companies must inform about data breaches \u2013 did not confirm whether or not Get had reported the breach. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the reports about a potential data breach involving Get. While we can\u2019t comment on the specifics, we would expect any organisation to act quickly to contain a data breach involving personal information and assess the potential impact on those affected,\u201d the spokesperson said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
