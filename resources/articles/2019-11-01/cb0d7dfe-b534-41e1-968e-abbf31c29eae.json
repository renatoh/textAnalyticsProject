So, how did it go from that to the Queen feeling she had no choice but to take the barely conceivable step of allowing one of her sons to step back from public duties altogether \u2013 in less than five days? The Duke of York\u2019s strategy had taken a hit even before he had sat down opposite the BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis. Andrew had already lost the services of Jason Stein, the spin doctor hired in September to restore his reputation. Stein had reportedly advised Andrew against the whole thing, preferring a longer-term strategy that included a great deal of charity work and interviews with print outlets to mark his birthday. The unravelling of the strategy began almost immediately after the interview ended. Andrew appeared pleased with his performance, even giving the Newsnight team a tour of the palace afterwards. But when lines from the interview began reaching journalists\u2019 inboxes early on Friday evening, they were astonished by what they read. By Saturday morning, the story was dominating the news agenda. The headlines were devastating for Andrew. And the interview had not yet even been aired. The early press reports focused on his claim that his decision to maintain close relations with Epstein despite the financier\u2019s conviction for sexual offences was motivated primarily by the prince\u2019s \u201ctendency to be too honourable\u201d. Kept back by the BBC was the prince\u2019s claim that he could not have had sex with Virginia Giuffre, which she says she was coerced into doing while a teenager, because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking. Nor was his contention that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat at the time. Those revelations, when they came out, were met with incredulity and were shared widely online, adding fresh impetus to the story. By Sunday evening, Andrew was facing calls to speak to the FBI from lawyers representing 10 of the Epstein\u2019s victims. While some of the attention was focused on Andrew\u2019s extraordinary defence, there was strong criticism of his attitude towards the victims and the fact that he had not expressed sympathy for them in the interview. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said she could not understand \u201chow somebody could be talking about their relationship with [Epstein] without recognising, or understanding, or discussing, how he felt about those victims. And I felt they should have been much more at the centre of that discussion.\u201d The backlash continued into this week as numerous organisations began to cut ties with the prince. On Monday, it emerged that the accountancy giant KPMG would not be renewing its sponsorship of Andrew\u2019s entrepreneurial scheme, Pitch@Palace. That night a fresh Epstein accuser gave a press conference in Los Angeles where she detailed allegations that the financier assaulted her when she was 15 and urged Andrew to come forward to the authorities with whatever information he had about his former friend. On Tuesday, Standard Chartered also pulled out of Pitch@Palace as questions about Andrew\u2019s continued involvement in the scheme he founded in 2014 continued to circulate. They prompted a whole host of other firms to review their involvement or cut ties altogether. Wednesday morning brought no respite, as it emerged that three Australian universities had severed their links with the business-mentoring charity\u2019s Australian branch. On top of that, the telecoms firm BT said it would not work with Andrew\u2019s digital training scheme while he was a patron. Later that same day a letter emerged casting serious doubt on Andrew\u2019s claim in the BBC interview to have first met Epstein in 1999. The letter \u2013 written to the Times in 2011 to counter reports that the prince had been a friend of Saif Gaddafi, son of the former Libyan dictator \u2013 had come from his own former chief of staff, who said that the prince had met Epstein in \u201cthe early 1990s\u201d. At first, Buckingham Palace sought to defend Andrew over the apparent discrepancy. \u201cThe duke\u2019s words in the interview speak for themselves,\u201d said a spokesperson. By Wednesday afternoon, the palace sought to bring the issue to a close with Andrew\u2019s announcement that he would be stepping back from public duties and was \u201cwilling to help any appropriate law enforcement agency\u201d with their Epstein investigations if required."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
