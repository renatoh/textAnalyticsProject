This stricken individual is not some debtor avoiding creditors - well, not normally, anyway - but the editor of The Guardian Year, who has just been approaching one of the many deserving and talented writers who have failed to make this year's cut. I write this from grievous experience, since this year that haunted, hunted person is me. At least, unlike such predecessors as Ian Katz, Victor Keegan, Georgina Henry and John Ezard, I no longer work day to day in the Farringdon Road office in London and can mostly skulk in the suburbs. \"The abiding impression left with me,\" mourned Keegan in the 1999 number, the tears splattering the page as he wrote, \"is not what remains in The Guardian Year, but what was discarded.\" Absolutely. \"The arrival of the first copies of The Guardian Year in our offices,\" Katz noted last year, \"triggers a bout of sotto voce grumbling: 'Why are so many of the year's best pieces missing?'; 'Why are so many of the paper's finest writers not represented?' \" Again: absolutely. In Katz's case the grief was greater than most, since events in Afghanistan forced him to take his book to bits at the last moment and throw out much he had treasured all year. So now I know how they felt. It cannot be said too often that these annual productions do not claim to be the definitive best of the Guardian. When I joined the newspaper 37 years ago, before a fair few of the writers on these pages were born, we were putting out some 18 pages a day. Now the paper has become as vast as those American publications we used to open with sheer disbelief. Page 112! Did you ever? There is simply too much to digest, let alone to present. Some of the best of every Guardian year nowadays, especially in the Saturday Weekend section, is simply too long for this kind of book. That is why there is no Jon Ronson, for instance. Luke Harding has just landed a deserved award for his reporting from Afghanistan, but one of his two pieces filed from there, which I have used in The Guardian Year, appears under Sport. That is because it seemed necessary to squeeze in at least one of several excellent pieces evoking that curious war by James Meek. An account of the trial of Slobodan Milosevic by Jonathan Steele dislodged an earlier, no less admirable report from the same arena by Ian Black. I deleted an Andy Beckett interview with the home secretary almost at the last moment when I noticed that we had had a David Blunkett interview in the previous Guardian Year. Among others to go in my final pruning was one of Libby Brooks's four profiles of children growing up: the delicious photographs, by Linda Nyland, had to go with it. The section of this year's book which I called The Way We Live Now could have made a book on its own, with several memorable pieces, such as Audrey Gillan's on the links between Bangladesh and London E1, and Edwin Guiton's account of his life as a quadriplegic, relegated at the last moment into my \"casualties\" file. But even this list is probably a mistake, requiring even more abject skulking, since I have now created a second salon des refus\u00e9s : those who not only failed to make The Guardian Year, but have now been omitted even from my apologies. The instructions given to editors of The Guardian Year emphasise that this should be a personal choice. The line between personal choice and self-indulgence is difficult to define, and I fear I have crossed it once or twice. At least. This Alternative Guardian Year is not intended to be objective or shorn of the personal either. I just wish I could now embark on an Alternative Alternative Guardian Year, to give you just a hint of the best of the rest. I can't. But you can. There must be pieces that readers have treasured over the year (the year is defined, by the way, as running from October to October, which explains the omission of some superlative pieces that appeared after the deadline) and would much have preferred to see in The Guardian Year, or now, in this innovative alternative. Pictures, too, and cartoons - whatever.
