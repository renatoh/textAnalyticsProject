Brought back to its full three-and-a-half-hour-plus running time, it is colossally ambitious and mysteriously moving, with an unhurried, unforced pace, beautifully photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond. The subject is the Johnson county war in 1890s Wyoming: small homesteaders found themselves harassed into abandoning their plots of land to the big ranchers. Cimino's movie sees this as nothing other than an American agribusiness pogrom: these small farmers are migrant incomers from eastern and central Europe attacked by cattle barons and their Wasp Washington associates who have drawn up a \"death list\" of victims. Kris Kristofferson plays Jim Averell, a well-born lawyer, idealist and Harvard man who takes the farmsteaders' side; Christopher Walken is Nathan Champion, the ranchers' cynical hired gun. Both men are in love with Ella (Isabelle Huppert), the bordello keeper who is on the target list. As with Cimino's The Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate is partly about the terrible pathos in contrasting war with remembered happiness on the homefront. As a graduating Harvard man, young Averill takes part in a high-jinks game with a maypole-type ring of dancers, which eerily echoes the grim encirclement of warriors in the Johnson county war's last stand. It is a demanding film, without a doubt \u2013 but a passionate one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
