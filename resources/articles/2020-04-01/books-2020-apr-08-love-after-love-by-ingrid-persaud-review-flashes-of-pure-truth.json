This novel is her highly anticipated follow-up: the story of Trinidadian Betty Ramdin, who has suffered for years at the hands of her husband, an abusive drunk who \u201conly gave love you could feel. He cuff you down? Honeymoon. He give you a black eye? True love in your tail.\u201d Widowhood is Betty\u2019s respite. Following her husband\u2019s death she takes in a lodger, Mr Chetan, a profoundly decent man who becomes Betty\u2019s best friend as well as a father figure to her young son, Solo. They settle into a platonic partnership \u2013 cooking, gardening and raising Solo \u2013 creating a family as an antidote to their own unyielding loneliness. Persaud has a knack for finding the sublime in the ordinary: in her hands the quotidian details of even apparently \u201csmall\u201d lives lead to flashes of pure truth. The story is recounted through a series of tender, amusing vignettes, with Betty, Chetan and Solo taking turns at the narration. \u201cYou should see Mr Chetan and Solo,\u201d Betty says early on, \u201chappy as pappy and I\u2019m like a Wednesday in the middle.\u201d As with \u201cThe Sweet Sop\u201d, the language is colloquial, with both narrative and dialogue soaked in an ear-catching Trinidadian dialect. The prose is playful and rhythmic, seeming to beat its own drum, so that at times you don\u2019t read the novel so much as hear it. You sit in its company while it takes you into its confidence. Persaud plays with time as well as language, sometimes flitting over years in one paragraph, sometimes lingering forensically on a single episode. This feels slightly dizzying to begin with, but serves to draw us into a deeper intimacy with the characters, as if we have indeed born witness to a large span of their lives. When one evening Betty and Chetan are overheard by Solo spilling their deepest secrets to each other over glasses of rum, we feel a deep cut of grief at the way the revelations shatter their slapdash little family, causing Solo to flee to New York, where they \u201cthink all brown and black people make one way \u2013 thief, murderer, rapist or terrorist\u201d. There he is an illegal immigrant caught in a web of black-market fraudsters in his hunt for a fake social security number. Betty is left to grapple with a long, bitter estrangement from her son, even as she\u2019s tormented by the after-effects of an abusive marriage. Meanwhile, Chetan, driven by the realisation that \u201cMiss B and I needed to be free to meet other people otherwise it was like we were in a sexless marriage\u201d, becomes distracted by yearning for his first love Mani, with whom he reconnects via social media only to be envious of the contentment he\u2019s found with his husband. It\u2019s our unfolding awareness of the unyielding direction of Chetan\u2019s desires \u2013 jolting him into \u201c3am awakenings\u201d and filling him with \u201cfear, anticipation and horniness\u201d \u2013 that sinks in deep. A raw, achingly sensual encounter with a stranger in a public toilet leaves him reeling, and the reader with him. \u201cIf things were different,\u201d he says, \u201cI would have thanked him for making me feel unbroken, unmarked.\u201d This is one of the novel\u2019s most moving scenes, striking a tonal balance that seems almost alchemical. In \u201cThe Sweet Sop\u201d it was the balance of \u201canger and humour and love\u201d that earned accolades from the National short story award judges. Here, Persaud achieves another impeccable calibration: the contentment of Chetan\u2019s happy domestic life with Betty chafing against his acute loneliness as a gay man in a community where \u201csimply being me is illegal, immoral and perverted\u201d. One of the reasons Love After Love is so delightful is that it reads like a modern meditation on the different kinds of love as catalogued by the ancient Greeks, crossed with the characters\u2019 deliciously gossipy self-reflection. Persaud gives us a captivating interrogation of love in all its forms, how it heals and how it harms, the twists and torments of obsession (mania), sex and romance (eros), family (storge), friendship (philia), acceptance or rejection by the community, and so on. But much like the Derek Walcott poem from which it takes its title, the novel is ultimately concerned with the possibilities of that elated and oddly elegiac moment when we finally come to love ourselves. \u2022 Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton is published by Penguin.
