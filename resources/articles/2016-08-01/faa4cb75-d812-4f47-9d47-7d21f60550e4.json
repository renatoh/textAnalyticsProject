Kicking off what it hopes will be the largest global survey into people\u2019s language gripes, the dictionary publisher is inviting English speakers around the world to answer a range of language-related questions under the #OneWordMap initiative, starting with the quest to find the least popular English word. Oxford Dictionaries is hoping that tens of thousands of people will contribute, enabling it to put together a list of the least popular words by country, age, and gender, and revealing similarities and differences around the world. \u201cThere are a few likely suspects we\u2019re expecting to see. \u2018Moist\u2019 seems to be a word that people instinctively draw for, and it\u2019s already proven to be a popular response in some internal polls we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Oxford University Press\u2019s Daniel Braddock. More than 8,000 people have already submitted words to the poll, with differences beginning to emerge between countries. In the UK, \u201cmoist\u201d tops the list, followed by \u201cno\u201d, \u201chate\u201d, \u201clike\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d. Moist is also top of the list in the US and Australia. In the Netherlands, by contrast, \u201cwar\u201d and \u201clove\u201d both make appearances in the list of the top five least popular words, while in Spain, \u201chello\u201d is a surprising No 1. Just one submission, so far, has been made in Gibraltar: \u201cyellow\u201d. In New Zealand, the first response was \u201cphlegm\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re really not sure what words people will choose,\u201d said Braddock, \u201cbut our expectation is that they will be fuelled by a multitude of reasons. \u2018Cancer\u2019, for example, has affected most people in the world, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see that make an appearance. And there\u2019s a huge amount of commentary in the political field at the moment, so there\u2019s a chance we might see some submissions related to politics.\u201d Braddock said this was the first time Oxford Dictionaries had attempted to trace the world\u2019s most disliked English words. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve ever done before but we\u2019re really pleased to finally have it in place. We\u2019re constantly trying to find ways of getting people interested in words and language, and we\u2019re hoping that this will contribute to people\u2019s enthusiasm for the subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how much response we\u2019ll get, but we\u2019re hoping for somewhere in the region of 30,000. I\u2019m just hoping people find it interesting enough to share it, which will help contribute to the numbers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
