The judges and jury at the court in Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, refused to condemn Arce Montes to a life jail term, as the public prosecutor had requested. But they ordered that the 55-year-old restaurant worker, convicted or suspected of sex offences in five European countries, should have no chance of parole for 20 years. Caroline, 13, was found smothered to death on the floor of a shared room of the Pleine-Foug\u00e8res youth hostel, near Mont Saint Michel, on July 18 1996. She had been on a school trip to Brittany with 40 other pupils from Launceston community college. Her now-divorced parents, John and Sue, and sister Jenny, 20, said after the verdict they now hoped Caroline would be allowed to rest in peace. \"That phrase is often used when a family member has been lost,\" Mr Dickinson said. \"However, after nine years, it is now a real need - and we would ask everyone to respect this.\" Reading from a statement, Mr Dickinson said he felt the \"groundless\" appeal hearing - to which Arce Montes was automatically entitled under French law - showed \"the offender's rights had overshadowed those of the victims\". He added: \"We will never forget Caroline, nor the events of 18 July 1996, but we trust now we can draw a line under the necessary legal processes and look to the future.\" Before the jury retired to deliberate, Arce Montes, who admitted responsibility for the death but has denied any intention to kill, said he was deeply sorry. \"What I did was horrible. It cannot be forgiven,\" he said to Caroline's parents. \"I wish your daughter was still with you.\" But, he insisted in Spanish: \"At no moment did I want to take the life of this victim. I just did not want her to cry out ... I do not have the instinct of a killer, that much should be plain from my past.\" He begged the jury not to condemn him to \"a sentence of destruction\". His lawyer, Patrick Elghozi, told the court that his client should be judged for involuntary manslaughter. \"You must have the courage, despite the pressure of public opinion, to say that it is not absolutely certain that he meant to kill Caroline,\" he said. After a catastrophic early investigation led by a French examining magistrate who was way out of his depth, Arce Montes was finally caught only in 2001 thanks to an alert US immigration official who had read about the case, ran the name through a database and found that he had been in jail in Miami for lewd behaviour. Mr Dickinson said yesterday that he hoped the appropriate lessons had been learned. \"You all know how Montes was eventually caught,\" he said. \"But bringing such offenders to justice should be more a matter of course, and less a matter of chance.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
