His findings, if correct, would make the scale of tax evasion from sales going unreported to HMRC four times as big official figures suggest. The report, published on Monday, has been swiftly rejected by HMRC as \"seriously flawed\", although the tax campaigner said it had been peer reviewed by academics and other tax experts. Murphy said only a minority of his estimate for tax lost to the shadow economy related to self-employed workers. The lion's share, he says, is from 1.1m companies that tell HMRC they trade in the UK at an average loss of about \u00a310,000, and from a further 400,000 companies he estimates trade in the UK but do not file a tax return. \"We don't recognise the estimate of tax lost to companies,\" a spokesperson for HMRC said. \"We are extremely good at identifying companies which need to send in a tax return, pursuing overdue returns and generally protecting tax payable when a return doesn't appear.\" The size of the total gap between what taxpayers owe and what they pay was last year estimated by HMRC to be \u00a335m, or 7%, shortfall for 2011/12, but that includes legal and illegal tax dodging, fraud and errors. It said the shadow economy and evasion was costing it \u00a310.5bn. Murphy, an accountant and tax specialist, who until March last year sat on an HRMC panel of anti-avoidance experts, has been leading a campaign questioning the accuracy of HRMC figures on Britain's tax gap. Four years ago, when he last attempted to reach an independent figure, Murphy claimed HMRC's estimate for the tax gap of close to \u00a340bn was short of his calculation of \u00a370bn. Funded by Oxfam, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the TUC and the PCS union, Murphy today publishes the first of three peer-reviewed papers expected this summer, which tax campaigners believe will offer a more complete, warts-and-all assessment of the government's efforts to collect tax due. The next two papers, combined with his research out today, are once again expected to argue HRMC's figures capture less than half of Britain's true tax gap. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, said: \"Successive governments have failed to get to grips with the tax gap and this new research highlights anew just what that costs Britain. We urgently need this problem to be taken seriously by ministers, not least to help expel the myth that we need the austerity measures and public spending cuts that continue to impact so severely on the least well off.\" The political appetite for tough measures to tackling Britain's tax gap is expected to feature heavily in the run up to the general election next year. Last December George Osborne claimed to have put in place measure to crack down on avoidance, evasion, fraud and error that would raise more than \u00a39bn over five years, though the claim met with some scepticism by tax professionals. Extrapolating the latest available figures from HRMC, which relate to 2011/12, Murphy today claims that \u00a3100bn of UK sales are going unreported to the taxman \u2014 equivalent to \u00a31 in every \u00a310 of sales in Britain. \"If there are likely to be \u00a3100bn worth of sales not recorded in the UK \u2014 as [HMRC's] VAT gap inevitably implies \u2014 then all the direct taxes due on that income, such as income tax on salaries, national insurance, corporation tax and so on, will also not be paid,\" said Murphy. One top tax partner at a leading accountancy firm criticised Murphy's methodology, saying: \"Using economy-wide estimates to come up with the VAT gap is a flawed method, simply because it is too hard to move from an estimate of the size of the economy to an estimate of which parts of the economy should be subject to VAT and the VAT due thereon.\" He conceded this was a criticism of HRMC's own methodology also. A spokesperson for HMRC said: \"This is a seriously flawed study based on, among other things, a significant overestimate of the UK's VAT gap. HMRC's estimates, produced under the Code of Practice for Official Statistics, show the overall tax gap is \u00a335 billion and falling as a percentage of tax owed.\" Future reports from Murphy are also expected to include a challenge to HRMC's figures on tax avoidance, which do not capture the activities of many multinationals shifting profits from high-tax jurisdictions such as the UK to offshore tax havens. Murphy will challenge HMRC figures on inheritance tax it collects, which he argues greatly underestimated the scale Britain's property and financial wealth as set out in the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
