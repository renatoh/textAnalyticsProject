Victims, including victims of torture, have frequently been left out of the debate about how to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's past. They have a right to remedy and reparation. Anyone responsible for torturing people must be held accountable. This should include those higher up the chain of command who authorised torture or ill-treatment of detainees. It should also involve the possibility of criminal prosecutions, where appropriate. Without this, and without the truth, neither justice nor reconciliation will be achieved. Impunity will only breed further injustice. As UK security personnel stand accused of complicity in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees held overseas post-2001, and UK soldiers' treatment of Baha Mousa in Iraq is exposed by an inquiry, it seems that lessons from Northern Ireland have still not been learned. Kate Allen Amnesty International UK Jane Winter British Irish Rights Watch \u2022\u2008You report that some suspects, later cleared, were given poor advice by lawyers and that others were badly treated by the police, leading to false confessions. In the end it is not lawyers or police who decide on guilt, but judges, who surely are not so naive as to think there are no false confessions or misplaced pleas, and are obliged to explore the evidence before making a decision. It appears that in several quoted instances evidence that later led to an overturning of the guilty finding was available, had the court called for all that was known to be presented to it.
