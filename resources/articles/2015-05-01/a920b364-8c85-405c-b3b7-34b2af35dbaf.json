But don\u2019t forget culture", "bodyText": "There was plenty of chatter last week about the northern powerhouse and it\u2019s great to see \u2013 with Jim O\u2019Neill\u2019s appointment as commercial secretary at the Treasury \u2013 that this commonsense idea is gaining some traction. We firmly believe that with it will come enormous benefits for Manchester and the whole of the north. But in shouting loud for the need to control our own budgets for infrastructure including transport, health and social care and apprenticeships \u2013 all hugely important \u2013 let\u2019s not lose sight either of another fundamental that doesn\u2019t just make cities function better, but makes them indisputably better places to be. That fundamental is culture. The importance of culture and the arts to Manchester\u2019s growing reputation cannot be overstated. Cultural regeneration is as much a part of the city\u2019s future as the many groundbreaking developments including graphene (famously isolated by researchers Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University) and the like that are at the same time reshaping and advancing the city\u2019s global standing within the knowledge and skills economy. A walk through Manchester\u2019s streets shows a city not just awash with evidence of the Victorian pride of our ancestors, but embracing the new, future-proofing itself. Despite a backdrop of funding pressures that means prioritisation is king in the land of less than plenty, our experience proves that the need for cities to constantly reinvent themselves has never been more important. Hence the opening last week of Home \u2013 the city\u2019s new centre for international contemporary art, theatre and film, a \u00a325m cultural offering that includes \u00a319m of council cash. This reinvention \u2013 regeneration by another name \u2013 must look not just at the staples of business, economic, transport, education and community infrastructures, but also at cultural infrastructure. Ensuring a city has a \u201ccultural offer\u201d that makes it a place where people and businesses want to live, work and invest is not just desirable \u2013 we believe it is essential. From the 1980s and the early forays of Factory Records, bringing students and visitors to the city in their droves, to last autumn\u2019s announcement of government\u2019s \u00a378m investment in The Factory Manchester \u2013 a new, large-scale arts space for the city \u2013 Manchester\u2019s cultural regeneration has continued to gather pace. Then there was last year\u2019s reopening of the magnificent Central Library \u2013 using the very best of the past to ensure it meets the needs of the future \u2013 while the newly expanded Whitworth Art Gallery has seen visitors queuing around the block. We are also very proud of Manchester International festival. A festival of firsts celebrating new and original works, it has been called by the New Yorker \u201cprobably the most radical and important arts festival today\u201d. That the festival has been a positive driver for change in the city is indisputable. With 250,000 visitors to MIF 2013, and an estimated economic impact of \u00a338m, the figures alone show its value to the city. While underwriting the first festival in 2007 raised eyebrows in some quarters, our belief in the benefits MIF would bring to the city \u2013 financial and otherwise \u2013 has seen our investment repaid many times over. Like the rest of Manchester\u2019s substantial cultural provision, it draws in tourism and attracts wider inward investment by positioning the city as an international centre for culture and the arts. This clustering of cultural landmarks and events is not, of course, a coincidence. Nor is it simply a celebration of the creativity that runs through the history of the city. It\u2019s a direct acknowledgment of the catalyst that culture can be for economic growth, as well as firing imaginations and creative skills. The funding pot might be smaller, and the age of austerity upon us, but Manchester\u2019s investment in and commitment to culture is not the stuff of fancy. It\u2019s the product of hard-headed economic decisions. What\u2019s more, when the day job is done, we get to go out\u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
