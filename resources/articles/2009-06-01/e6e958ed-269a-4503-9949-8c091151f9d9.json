Football's giant spaceship, complete with mini-Wembley arch, has issued its declaration of war a few hundred metres from the home of KwaZulu-Natal's Sharks. When the series ends in Johannesburg a fortnight from today, the great Springbok World Cup-winning side of 2007 is expected to disintegrate as big names are lured by juicy contracts at European clubs. In the face of these encroachments, South African rugby's next challenge is to hold on to its status as the most inspirational force in a sporting culture that is mutating by the day. It's not easy being a symbol of national rebirth when you have your skull in a scrummage in the opening minutes of a contest that was characterised, back in the 1960s and 70s, by ferocious violence and deep colonial antipathy. John Smit, the Springbok captain, expects the opening exchanges between the two front rows to be \"hot and steamy\" as \"the fat boys\" seek psychological and territorial mastery. Bakkies Botha, the giant wildebeest-shooting lock, warns: \"The folk at home should keep their blankets pulled up to their chins.\" The fusion of old Boer machismo and South African modernity is the most miraculous feat of social engineering in world sport, and it is a wonder successive Springbok sides have not fallen down the chasm of contradictions between what South African rugby once was and what it is now expected to be. The miracle was authored, of course, by Nelson Mandela and Francois Pienaar's 1995 World Cup winners, who delivered on Mandela's declaration to the ANC: \"Up to now rugby has been the application of apartheid in the sports field. But now things are changing. We must use sport for the purpose of nation-building and promoting all the ideas which we think will lead to peace and stability in our country.\" Only six years have passed since outrage gripped South Africa when Rudolph Straeuli's 2003 World Cup squad were marched to Kamp Staaldraad (Camp Barbed Wire) to crawl naked over gravel and have ice water poured into foxholes while they cowered, singing anthems. The burlesque was exposed by the Springbok video analyst Dale McDermott, who plunged into clinical depression and later shot himself at his home here in Durban. Since then the Boks have regained their inspirational aura, beating England 15\u20136 in the 2007 World Cup final in Paris, but the game is entering a period of flux. The Lions have beaten six weakened provincial teams who have been condemned, by traditionalists, as an affront to the Springbok tradition of aggression and defiance. Only in the last match, against the Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth, did the Lions run up against the old Springbok warrior spirit. Institutionalised belligerence dates from the time when rugby was \"the chosen sport of a chosen people\", or \"the Opium of the Boer\", to quote from John Carlin's book on the 1995 triumph, Playing the Enemy. The purpose in revisiting apartheid on the day of the match is simply to illustrate how fast South African rugby continues to change. The world it left behind, according to Carlin, was \"the closest [the Boers] got, outside church, to a spiritual life. They had their Old Testament Christianity, otherwise known as the Dutch Reformed Church, and they had their secular religion, rugby, which was to Afrikaners as football was to Brazilians or cricket was to the residents of Kolkata or Mumbai\". Bridges between the two ages abound. The father of Fourie du Preez, today's scrum-half, scored twice two tries against the Lions for Northern Transvaal in 1968 when apartheid was entrenched. Now his son rides round on a team coach emblazoned with the slogan: \"One team carrying the Nation, One Nation carrying the team.\" The new, country-leading Springboks are fighting a talent drain to Europe and bracing themselves for Fifa's tsunami this time next year. Provincial rugby has thrown up the brilliant Bulls, the Super 14 champions, so the game's roots remain strong. Yet those who have attended all six matches on this tour speak of a strange lack of hostility, of tribal fervour, in sanitised and corporate logo-splattered stadiums with swaths of empty seats. Today, the missing intensity will return as a Springbok side with more than 700 caps pursue revenge for the lost series of 1997, when Martin Johnson's team won in Cape Town and Durban. As elder statesman and custodian of the 1995 legacy, the engaging Smit has mastered his script. In the Springbok media HQ, an Indian restaurant across the road from their hotel, he provided an insight on all the non-rugby forces bearing down on his men: \"As captain of the side I would like to think we play a large influential role within the country. The Springboks are a massive part of what people talk about on a Monday morning when they get to work. But it goes a lot further than that. We are a team that takes on the responsibility of what South Africa has become and is becoming. \"I believe we have really good ambassadors for this country, when we're here in South Africa and when we're abroad. We give an idea of what it's like to be a good South African. That's very important to the players and the coaching staff. It's always difficult to be perfect all the time and be on your best behaviour, especially when you've got guys ranging from 19 to 32. But we'd like to have kids come up to us and look to us as an example.\" These onerous duties will be pushed to one side when the whistle blows and Springbok rugby reverts to its other, more fearsome nature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
