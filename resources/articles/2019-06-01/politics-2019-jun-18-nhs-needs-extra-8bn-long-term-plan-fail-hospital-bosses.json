Waiting times will keep getting worse, hospitals will remain overstretched and efforts to reduce ill-health will falter without a further major injection of cash, they claim in a new analysis. The department of health and social care\u2019s (DHSC) budget is due to rise to \u00a3155bn in 2023/24 as a result of the \u00a320.5bn extra a year Theresa May promised last year to mark the NHS\u2019s 70th birthday. But the next prime minister will have to increase that to \u00a3163bn or the NHS long-term plan will not transform the service so that it can cope with the demands of the ageing and growing population, it is claimed. The warning and plea for extra cash are contained in a new analysis by the Health Foundation thinktank published on Tuesday and endorsed by the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses. Despite May\u2019s pledge, ministers must realise that NHS funding remains \u201cunfinished business\u201d if it is to expand and improve the care it provides, said Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation. It has identified three key areas \u2013 not covered by the \u00a320.5bn, which applies only to NHS England\u2019s budget \u2013 that will need more money to stave off the likelihood of failure. Health Education England will need at least \u00a3900m extra a year to recruit and train health professionals to help tackle the NHS\u2019s chronic staffing shortage. Despite that, the agency\u2019s budget is being cut every year so the NHS can be given more money. Capital spending \u2013 which hospitals use to build and renovate buildings, buy equipment such as scanners, and invest in IT \u2013 will require an extra \u00a34.4bn, taking its budget up from \u00a35.9bn to \u00a310.3bn. And public health will need \u00a31.5bn more to help drive efforts to prevent illness and encourage healthier behaviours, which are central to the long-term plans\u2019s chances. In addition, social care will need its own separate boost of \u00a34.4bn a year by 2023/24, otherwise older people\u2019s inability to access it will continue to create more work for the NHS, they added. In total, the two interlinked services will need to receive an estimated \u00a312.4bn more than now between them by the end of March 2023 or the NHS\u2019s ambitions will be stymied. The other \u00a31.2bn that makes up the \u00a38bn would go on the budgets of the DHSC itself, the Care Quality Commission and NHS Blood and Transplant. Dixon added: \u201cThere are mounting workforce shortages, the social care system is starved of funding, capital investment is going backwards, and public health funds cut. \u201cThis all piles demand on the NHS and risks swallowing up the extra money and leaving far less to modernise care, reduce waiting times and prevent illness in the first place. How can any industry significantly boost productivity without investing in staff training, technology and kit?\u201d Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said that while many parts of the NHS were improving care, hospital bosses had \u201cserious concerns\u201d. \u201cThey face crippling staff vacancies, rising demand for care, lack of investment in buildings and equipment, and the drastic cuts to social care and public health that are fuelling extra demand on A&amp;E and other frontline services.\u201d NHS leaders hope that the spending review that was expected to take place in the autumn will bring forward extra funds for all four areas. However, it is unclear whether the review will take place, given the political uncertainty related to Brexit and fact that there will be a new prime minister. A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS long-term plan has been welcomed across the health system, backed by a record cash increase to the NHS budget. We are also providing an extra \u00a33.9bn in dedicated adult social care funding this year and giving councils \u00a33.5bn to fund public health services.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
