By picking it up and throwing it back, while apparently looking his assailant in the eye, the Liverpool defender raised the stakes. Carragher was immediately sent off for violent conduct in circumstances that may have been without precedent in the English game. Eric Cantona, after all, had already been dismissed when he took direct action against a fan who abused him from the terrace at Selhurst Park. Since Arsenal had just lost Martin Keown and Dennis Bergkamp to red cards, Carragher's dismissal cost his side - a goal behind with 20 minutes to play - the chance to exploit an unusual numerical advantage. \"Jamie Carragher cannot do what he did,\" Phil Thompson, Liverpool's acting manager, said afterwards. \"I told him he had let himself, his team-mates and the club down. He was angry about getting hit, but that still doesn't make what he did right.\" But if Carragher's behaviour was inexcusable, it might nevertheless have done football a favour by putting a worrying phenomenon firmly into the spotlight. For several weeks players have been required to dodge all kinds of objects while venturing near the touchline in matches carrying a high emotional tariff. \"It worries me greatly,\" Thompson said. \"I watch the games and I've seen it happening. You could see it happen here. And what Jamie did doesn't help matters.\" Last night a spokesman for the Football Association said that they would be talking to the match officials and examining the circumstances before taking action. And now, surely, something will have to be done. The reintroduction of perimeter fences is out of the question, but the FA will have to find a way of showing fans that such behaviour is unacceptable - and of telling players that they must turn the other cheek, no matter what the provocation. Given human nature, a failure to take significant action would amount to licensing the kind of copycat behaviour that is surely responsible for the present outbreak. Half a meat pie landing on the pitch at the New Den is all very amusing, but grounds should already have been closed in the wake of more dangerous incidents at White Hart Lane, Ninian Park and Stamford Bridge. To penalise Arsenal for the action of a single spectator after yesterday's enthralling win would be grossly unfair to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, to his players, and to the vast majority of their supporters. Yet it may be the only way to halt a phenomenon that has the potential to bring scenes of genuine tragedy back to English grounds. Referees have a part to play here. The FA must tell them that, at the least sign of trouble from the crowd, the players will be taken from the pitch and the match suspended. It would be nice to add \"and replayed at a neutral venue\", but it is not hard to imagine a situation in which supporters representing either the home or the away team would use the knowledge of that ruling to truncate a match that was going against their side. A special standing tribunal might be the answer, empowered to judge each case on its merits and to order the appropriate action. For his gesture of retaliation, Carragher became the third player to be sent off by the referee, Mike Riley, within a four-minute period, each in contentious or unusual circumstances. The first was Keown, judged to be the last defender when he used his arm to impede the progress of Michael Owen. A couple of minutes later it was the turn of Bergkamp, who thought no one would see him trying to stamp on Carragher's ankle. He missed, but suffered anyway. \"The law doesn't differentiate between whether you make contact or not,\" the referee said. The Dutchman's reluctant departure ignited the passion that led, a minute later, to Carragher's dismissal. Wenger, outwardly unmoved by his team's ninth and 10th red cards of the season, called it \"the sort of Cup tie a neutral would pay to see\". He was not wrong. But that may not be worth the knowledge that somewhere this morning, an Arsenal fan is nursing the belief that his or her vile gesture helped to seal their side's continued presence in the FA Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
