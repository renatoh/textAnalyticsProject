The six elephants, which had escaped from an amusement park, trumpeted through crowded roads, blundered their way into a restaurant and wandered through a garden. A woman, Roh In-sun, was injured by the trunk of one of the beasts as it charged through a narrow alley, sending pedestrians flying. \"She fell, and I ran away because I was scared,\" said Ms Roh's landlord, Lee Hye-ja, who had been standing next to her. The rampage began when one of the elephants bolted as it was being led on a daily parade outside their enclosure in Seoul Children's Grand Park. The five others followed \"because they have the tendency to do that,\" a zoo official told Reuters. Police and firefighters rounded up five of the elephants, but they had to cordon off streets before they could catch the sixth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
