The burden of regulation, having risen, should now fall - so that companies can focus on driving up productivity. Savings, which Gordon Brown has penalised, should now be encouraged - so that people can feel secure as they approach retirement. \"Most of all, the government needs to accept that real reform of the public services is required to deliver the improvements everyone wants to see. \"Labour's 60 tax rises and extra spending have not delivered the higher standards we were promised in return. We need to leave public service professionals free to manage. And we need to make them accountable to choices made not by bureaucrats but by the people they chose to serve.\" Liberal Democrats \"The Liberal Democrats would tax incomes over \u00a3100,000 a year at 50%. We would also scrap the unfair council tax and replace it with a local income tax based on ability to pay. \"Money raised from taxing incomes over \u00a3100k at 50% would pay for three things only: \u00b7 Scraping tuition and top-up fees for students \u00b7 Introducing free personal care for the elderly \u00b7 Keeping down the rate of local taxes \"We would also raise around \u00a35bn by switching money from lower priority programmes to our priorities, such as by cutting the DTI budget. We would spend that money on the people and frontline services who need it the most.\" Caroline Lucas, Green party The Green party would: \u00b7 Benefit low and average earners by abolishing VAT and increasing income tax on our highest earners \u00b7 Introduce a non-means-tested citizens' income to replace existing benefits \u00b7 Scrap means-testing for pensioners \u00b7 Abolish tuition fees and reintroduce student grants, funded from taxation \u00b7 Use fuel tax to fund an energy efficiency programme to reduce domestic energy use by 30% within 10 years \u00b7 Put 6p on a litre of petrol, but abolish tax discs, leaving typical motorists with smaller cars \u00a330 a year better off \u00b7 End aviation's \u00a39.2bn annual tax break and scrap the \u00a330bn roads programme, to fund public transport. Malcolm McLean Office of Pensions Advisory Service \"I would like to see a bit of support for employers. We have a system where employers are closing final salary schemes down at a rate of knot because they can't afford to run them. Hopefully improvements in the stock market will help that, but an employer who decides to run a good scheme ought to be recognised and get more help and tax relief. \"The best future for pensions in this country is in the work place. Some employers are recognising the benefits of running a good pension scheme in terms of recruiting and retaining staff. That's what I would really like to see happen, but I don't expect it will.\" Joanne Gill Halifax \"We would like to see the threshold for stamp duty increased. It hasn't been revised since 1993, yet house prices have increased massively. A lot of first-time buyers are having to pay stamp duty on properties when they would not have had to previously. Raising the threshold would make things easier on them. \"We would also like to see changes to inheritance tax thresholds. Because of the increase in house prices over recent years, many people are affected by inheritance tax just because the person who has died owned a property. The current limit [\u00a3255,000] is not high enough.\" Olivier Foster, housing policy spokesman Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \"The big thing for us will be changes to VAT for renovations and repairs. This is something that is moving up the agenda across Europe. Currently, there are two rates. VAT on new builds is 0%, while on renovations and repairs it is charged at the full 17.5%. \"We would like both to be charged at 5%. This would bring about a level playing field, and would encourage the development of brownfield housing stock areas and the renovation of currently empty houses.\" Ray Boulger Senior technical manager, independent mortgage broker Charcol \"The Treasury should not interfere with the mortgage market. As long as borrowers exercise their choices, they can have pretty much any sort of mortgage deal they like at the moment. There is more choice in the mortgage market here than there is anywhere else in the world. \"As for inheritance tax, it went up by a modest amount last year because of inflation, but the threshold should be increased substantially. At the moment, too many elderly people are having to jump through hoops to make sure their estates are not affected by IHT.\" CBI \"Too much of the government's public service investment programme is being eaten up by extra costs. Improvements in public sector productivity are failing to match the increase in investment. The government must urgently improve the efficiency of public spending or face the painful choice of scaling back investment or increasing taxes further. \"The private sector is busting a gut to be both productive and competitive. Surely taxpayers - businesses and individuals - are entitled to see the public sector do the same. The CBI wants the public sector to examine the potential for external benchmarking (comparisons with the private sector), to introduce greater competition between public service providers, to increase flexible working and to make better use of capital and learn from the private sector.\" The Forum of Private Business, a small business organisation \"Our top priority is the scrapping of the increase in national insurance contributions (announced in the 2002 budget) and a reduction in red tape. Keeping up with changing regulations is estimated to cost business \u00a35.5bn a year and small businesses have been unable to take full advantage of initiatives such as tax credits for research and development due to the overly bureaucratic processes involved in claiming for them. \"We would like to see uniform business rates with rates levied according to size of business rather than size of premises. The insurance premium tax - the 5% levy on employers liability insurance - should be reduced or abolished. We would also like to see a cut in taxes on business profits.\" The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club economic thinktank \"The chancellor can just about claim that he will meet his economic growth forecasts (2-2.5%) as we think the UK will grow by 2% this year. But the public finances will be adrift. We predict that borrowing this year will be \u00a336bn, that's \u00a39bn higher than Mr Brown had forecast. He has to get the bad news out now or in the budget, and we hope he does it now. \"The gap will get wider as revenues, which are increasing by 6%, fail to match spending which is increasing by 8-9% a year. You cannot increase revenues any more as that would put constraints on growth. So spending will have to come down to around 6%.\" TUC \"The big priority for the TUC is to ensure the public spending commitments through to 2005 are delivered in full. We hope and expect the chancellor to announce that he will meet his fiscal rules, namely that spending on the day-to-day running costs of government must be matched by tax receipts over the current economic cycle. Also vitally important will be an announcement that the successful employer training pilots will be rolled out across the country. These schemes offer employers a generous subsidy if they allow their employees to acquire basic skills. \"A landmark announcement would be for the chancellor to say that people will in the future have a legal right to take up such training at no direct cost to the employer. Some good news for the hard pressed manufacturing sector would not come amiss, including new ideas for business support and for investment in R&amp;D, innovation and skills.\" Local Government Association \"The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury have generally supported moves to free councils up to respond more flexibly to local needs and circumstances. The review provides an opportunity to establish a more consistent approach across government, including the big spending departments. Crucial to making a reality of devolved decision-making is the government's delivery planning process, led by the prime minister's delivery unit. A new approach to delivery planning is needed that encourages government departments to work with councils and their partners in different ways in different areas.\" Unison \"Key for Unison will be a signal that the chancellor will continue investing in our public services - our underlying economy is still strong and there is no need to retreat from earlier commitments. Staff are crucial to providing world-class public services and we would expect the chancellor to earmark enough money for next year's pay round to sustain and improve recruitment and retention rates. Local government needs a cash boost to make sure cuts in services are avoided. And we think the chancellor needs to increase child tax credit by \u00a35 a week to make sure the government hits child poverty reduction targets.\" Association of Directors of Social Services \"We want to see extra investment in children's services following on from the green paper - particularly in preventive services and funding to develop Sure Start-like services in the community similar to those in place for younger children. The ADSS wants further commitment to direct payments and user-managed services for older people and people with disabilities. \"Substantial investment in the social care workforce is essential to help sustain the existing profile of the profession and to attract greater numbers to social work, including qualified professionals. We also need substantial investment in IT programmes to improve information-sharing within children's services, as well as enhancing the single assessment process generally.\" Transport and General Workers Union \"We want the chancellor to continue to invest in public services. The money must go where it is needed - better facilities for service users and quality pay for the quality workforce we all know will deliver, instead of routinely bringing in private companies at the expense of loyal public sector workers. He should ensure our bus services get the public investment they need to produce real and quick improvements in local transport. Finally, the government must play an active part in developing our manufacturing base, not least through the \u00a3100bn of public purchases each year.\" Royal College of Nursing \"We still have an acute nursing shortage and would like the chancellor to make sure that the money he has already identified to implement the new pay and career structure is strongly ringfenced so that it really results in encouraging nurses to stay in the profession. The chancellor should commit to continue to make available to the Department of Health the funds to meet the full costs of training student nurses, including tuition fees. Nurses would like to spend less time on filing and form-filling and more time with their patients, so we would like to see extra funding to provide them with administrative support.\" New Local Government Network \"The pre-budget report rarely deals directly with the key issues facing localgovernment but says a lot that affects it. We're looking for positive signs that the balance of funding review is really getting to grips with the key issues and that the chancellor's enthusiasm for \"new localism\" has not diminished. Beyond this, we hope to see recognition that the government's major objectives - from dealing with antisocial behaviour, improving education underachievement and attacking child poverty - cannot be met unless local government and other local agencies are given more freedoms in how they tackle it.\" Disabilities Trust \"Top priority should be a continuing commitment to investment in public services bearing in mind the current uncertainties regarding the government's finances. This is crucial for service providers aiming to meet the complex needs of people with disabilities. In addition, as the voluntary sector has been hit with significant extra costs recently, in particular this year's national insurance increase, we hope the chancellor has not closed his mind to the inconsistencies surrounding irrecoverable VAT and that his department will accept the need to review this issue.\" Age Concern England \"Pension credit is good news for many but mountains of cash still lie unclaimed. The government must tackle pensioner poverty head-on and take steps to give women a fair deal for pensions. The chancellor should introduce a flexible system of credits that recognises the role of carers by enabling them to build up pension provision. The government must also honour its commitment to outlaw mandatory retirement ages and make it easier for older people to retrain or learn new skills. Just because you're 65 doesn't mean you should get your P45. A lump sum for deferring the state pension until 70 could help - if it's high enough.\" NHS Confederation \"The Treasury has already made significant commitments to a high level of NHS funding over the past three years. This investment is making a real difference, as last week's report on the improving quality of NHS care by the independent Nuffield Trust demonstrated. We hope that the chancellor will reaffirm this commitment in his pre-budget report and guarantee sustained high investment for the NHS for the foreseeable future so that we can continue to transform the NHS and improve the quality of care patients receive.\" The Children's Society \"We would like to see an end to the separate, discriminatory system of support for refugees, which keeps them in poverty; higher levels of benefit and practical policies to tackle the poverty experienced by families caring for a disabled child; and steps to ensure appropriate support and benefits for 16 and 17-year-olds, especially those who run away and find themselves at risk on the streets.\" The National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers \"The No 1 thing the government could tackle this year is child poverty. Social deprivation is a major contributing factor to the violence and indiscipline in the schools that are seeing staff members leave the profession.\" The Association of Colleges \"We want to see more money spent on raising the skills of young people who leave school at the age of 16, as well as the workforce in general. Any money we receive will be put into college buildings, staff and new efforts to tackle bureaucracy.\" Paul Mackney, the general secretary of the teaching union Natfhe \"No 1: Grants not fees. No 2: The end to penny pinching on teachers' pay. No 3: Less stress in the workplace.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
