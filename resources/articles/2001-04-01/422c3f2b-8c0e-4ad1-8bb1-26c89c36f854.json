But if the intimate secrets of a power-obsessed, vindictive quiz-show hostess fail to entice, you need only wait until next year for LB to present a brace of tell-all autobiogs by two equally contentious figures. Schools tsar turned columnist Chris Woodhead kicks off, followed in June by the memoirs of none other than John McEnroe. Rumour has it that the advance for the latter weighed in at a costly \u00a3750,000, which prompts the question - can they be serious? \u0095 As sales of walking books, maps and countryside guides take a nosedive in the current crisis, a foray into guidebook publishing comes from an unexpected source. The Ministry of Sound - which the Loafer understands to be a sort of trendy discotheque - are launching Misguided, a series of handbooks for the \"savvy party person\". The first handbook, which gives you the lowdown to Ibiza, promises to be written \"in a language and tone that clubbers will relate to\", which rather suggests the MoS won't be hiring Paul Theroux or Jan Morris for the job. But at least the publishers have a sense of their own worth: the book will retail at \"a mere \u00a37.99,\" which, they tell us, \"is most reasonable for the priceless information it contains\". We'll be the judge of that. \u0095 Banking on more authors to stay on their feet than did nags at Aintree, William Hill has offered odds on the forthcoming Impac Literary Award. Except they're rather hedging their bets: Colm Toibin is 5/1, Andrew O'Hagan, Margaret Cezair-Thompson and Silvia Molina are all 4/1, Alistair Macleod is 7/2, and Muscovite Victor Pelevin is just favourite at 5/2. \u0095 All good things come to those who wait: 25 years after it was first written, former Battle of Britain fighter pilot Geoffrey Wellum's memoir is to be published by Viking. But the commission came in a rather roundabout way - Wellum was being interviewed by Penguin publicist James Holland, who was carrying out research for a novel of his own. Holland put Wellum in touch with Antony Beevor's editor Eleo Gordon, who immediately saw in the manuscript the makings of a classic. Expect rival publishers to send out searches for under-the-mattress bestsellers forthwith. \u0095 News from the Times Literary Supplement of a rather unusual request for back copies - several hundred, in fact. In need were the set designers of the film of John Bayley's Iris. Apparently, Bayley and Murdoch never threw a copy away.
