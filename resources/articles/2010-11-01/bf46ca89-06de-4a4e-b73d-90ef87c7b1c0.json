After the injury to his ankle and the upheaval in his life, Wayne Rooney scored the winner. In keeping with his diminution of late, he merely took the goal with a penalty after a high challenge by Steven Naismith had caught F\u00e1bio da Silva. The manner of the conversion could be what Sir Alex Ferguson now remembers keenly. Rooney sent Allan McGregor the wrong way. It may not have been a demonstration of virtuosity, but there was touch of the swaggering that encouraged United to pay so very much and ensure that Rooney signed a new contract. Where finance is concerned, the contrasts are stark. Rangers, whose line-up had to be makeshift here, have barely been able to afford a signing in the past couple of years, yet there is no disintegration. They were very close here to matching the goalless draw achieved at Old Trafford earlier in Group C. United and Valencia have left them behind but Walter Smith, in his last season as Rangers manager, can still hope for impact in the Europa League. He will readily agree that his approach to football contains a marked pragmatism, but any other approach would be folly. In any case, his side unsettled United on occasion in a manner that is not all that common in the Premier League. It is true, of course, that the victors had other concerns in mind. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic were excused duty so they would be fit for the game with Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. The England defender, in particular, gives the manager pause for thought since his capacity to play matches in quick succession is extremely doubtful. The United back four was makeshift by design at Ibrox, with Ferguson realising that the highest finesse is beyond Rangers' means. That calculation only just turned out to be accurate. The Scottish champions were not always blunt and there were moments of alarm for the visitors' line-up. For long periods, the Ibrox audience enjoyed itself. \"So far, so good,\" said the announcer at half-time, finding satisfaction in Rangers' resilience. His ambition was not as low as it appeared on an occasion when Smith could find no more than six individuals suitable for the substitutes' bench, with one place left unoccupied. It had, indeed, come as a relief to the manager that he had pieced together a five-man defence, the foundation he favours for a European game of this magnitude. The outlook is well known and no home supporter had arrived in expectation of dashing football from their side. Rooney might have been on the pitch at kick-off for United for the first time since 26 September at Bolton Wanderers, but he had to labour hard to strengthen the resemblance to his former self. There was improvement as time passed and that will seem satisfactory in a fixture that was a staging post for the attacker. Rangers were initially more at ease than anticipated. Even the quintet in the centre of the pitch was not all that stodgy when some had an occasional licence to push up in support of the lone forward Kenny Miller. He might well have scored in the 16th minute. The striker nodded wide after a Steve Davis free-kick had been headed his way by Kirk Broadfoot. Rangers were entitled to bottle up the game in midfield as much as was feasible. Rooney, in principle, was meant to tease open the ranks of opponents, but he did not look equipped yet for such work. In view of Valencia's surge \u2013 the Spaniards eventually beat Bursaspor 6-1 to secure their own place in the knock-out stage \u2013 little was at stake any longer in this group, but Rangers relished the occasion. They had the most incisive move prior to the interval, when Miller complete a one\u2011two with Naismith that released him into the penalty area from the right. The angle was acute but he attempted a shot for the far post rather than a cut-back to a colleague. Edwin van der Sar blocked the finish. That had been an unexpected incident and it was inevitable that the United tempo would rise following some words from Ferguson at the interval. Rooney put a free-kick a little wide and then set up Michael Carrick for an effort that was saved by McGregor. Even so, Rangers were not resigned to disintegration. They alarmed the visitors, with Naismith getting behind the centre\u2011half Jonny Evans before Van der Sar denied him. In defeat, Smith's line-up should still take encouragement for maintaining this fixture as a contest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
