It had been a secondary modern and a grammar school separated by a road, but they were turned into one school and I had a really good time there. History and English were both really good lessons for me. I did English at university, but I wish I'd done history. It's a great subject for writers, because it's all about stories. Even more than English is, it seemed to me, because when I was at university that was all critical theory. The historians could sit around having arguments about the origins of the second world war and that seemed like far more fun. I've thought about doing an MA in history with the Open University, to get some guided history teaching. When I was about 13, the poet Gillian Clark came and did a poetry session at our school. I wrote a poem in about an hour and at the end of the session she gave me an A**. I don't know where the inspiration for the poem came from - I look at it now and I still think it's quite good. It was the first time I'd ever felt that I could be top of the class at something and it was really important to me. And now I do school visits, too, and find them very inspiring. When everyone's engaging in the creative process it's great. As far as teaching creative writing goes, you can't teach boring people to be more interesting, I do believe that, but you can help people to have more control over language and to express themselves in a better way. My new book is about sex trafficking. I was on a train from Norwich to London and was reading a report in the paper about a girl who was trafficked to England and escaped. She had come into the country through Harwich, so would have travelled to London on the same train as me. It sparked off my imagination and the more I found out, the more I wanted to write about it. It's a book for teenagers because it's about things that are happening to teenagers. I couldn't see any other way to do it that wouldn't be voyeuristic. Teenagers need to know about sex. We need really good discursive sex education where people can ask questions like, \"How do we feel about lap-dancers?\", \"How does a girl feel when she gets called a bitch?\", \"How do you say no?\" I know there are some very good schools that do that, but it's not universal. My own sex education was terrible. It was in biology and it was really embarrassing, involving condoms and bananas. It was very much a case of working it out for yourself. \u00b7 Julia Bell is a lecturer in creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London, and author of Dirty Work, a novel about sex trafficking"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
