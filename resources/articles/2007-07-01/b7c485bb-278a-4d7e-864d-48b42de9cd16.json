I don't really appreciate what is at stake but I get excited anyway when they run fast or throw something really far, without really grasping the skill required to achieve such goals. In order to understand it fully, I decided I'd have to experience it. Motivation was easy to come by, given that the last time I took part in any meaningful sporting activity, George Michael was straight. So, with a swagger in my step and a fag in my hand, I recently joined more than 20,000 enthusiastic rain-soaked road-runners for the annual Asics British 10k, which snakes through central London. While there is a swell of serious athletes, the majority of the field are just a swell of abused muscles, all raising money for charity, which in my case was the Winnicott Foundation. The race started and, 45 minutes later, I crossed the start line, beginning what was to be 58 minutes of ups, downs and downright agony. The hardest part was the fourth kilometre, with every muscle burning and every neuron in my brain urging me to veer left into a rather alluring riverside pub that the vindictive, sadistic organisers made us pass three times. The most humiliating part was being overtaken by a man dressed as a giant spoon. Momentary distraction came in the form of a gentleman dressed as a stick of dynamite which, given that the terrorist threat had just been raised to critical, wasn't great timing. Still, it was fascinating to see how the general pace quickened every time the field passed a parked Mercedes. With nine kilometres completed and my body shaking with fatigue, I had yet to discover the joy of athletics, to understand what makes individuals spend almost every day of their lives pounding roads, tracks and their bones in order to run just a little bit faster than the next competitor. Then it happened. The end was in sight, I could hear the crowd cheering and, as I crossed the finish line, a surge of euphoria swept through me as I punched the air in a style reminiscent of Sebastian Coe at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. It may have been only 10k, and I may have been outraced by a gaggle of Essex dinner ladies in clown costumes, but reaching the tape was genuinely one of the greatest buzzes of my life - which is saying something as I once shared a Jacuzzi with Dot Cotton. I'd instantaneously developed a whole new appreciation for the sport and, as I sat watching the formula one that afternoon, still wearing my medal, craning my neck to see over the top of my swollen knees, I was already plotting my next 10k race. It's something I'd recommend to the entire nation. So to my new-found enthusiasm for tomorrow's British grand prix in Sheffield, featuring some of the world's greatest athletes. The 100m men's world record is under threat from Tyson Gay who has already, unofficially, run faster than the 9.77 seconds mark set by Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin. Sheffield will also welcome the golden girl of world athletics, Carolina Kluft. Much attention, however, will be focused on Oscar Pistorius, who had both legs amputated at the knee before his first birthday. The Paralympic three-time world record holder will compete in the 400m able-bodied race, in a line-up that includes the Olympic and world champion, Jeremy Wariner. At first glance it is a heart-warming feel-good story but controversy rages, as some claim that the carbon fibre blades (artificial limbs known as Cheetahs) give him an unfair advantage. Just to be crystal clear on this, the International Association of Athletics Federations has sanctioned his inclusion primarily as part of its research into the issue. Details have emerged of an able-bodied South African who was running the 100m in 10.2sec, only to suffer an accident, resulting in his use of the same blades. He now averages a time of 11.3sec. It seems undisputable that these blades are not bionic and it seems unimaginable that someone who does not have legs could have an advantage over someone who does - unless he is on a motorbike. Those more expert than I may reach a different conclusion over the coming weeks but for now see it as a remarkable personal achievement and an inspiration to those who may wish to follow in his blade steps. However, while I look forward to athletics on the BBC for the first time in light years, what really excites me is plotting my next fun running journey. I have all the motivation I need every time I open the kitchen drawer. I tell you, that spoon is going to get it. colin.murray@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
