In yesterday's Daily Mail it was necessary to wade through 14 pages of weekend coverage before locating a skimpy 150-word report, buried away in the basement next to the ice hockey results. Jenson Button was partly to blame, of course, but it was still no way to salute perhaps the greatest feat ever achieved by a British athlete of either sex in the history of indoor sports. An exaggeration? Boxing, cycling and snooker will take up the cudgels but let's put the remarkable Beth Tweddle's triumph in the floor exercises at the world championships into some kind of perspective. Imagine the Maldives beating Brazil at football. Or the Falklands bowling out the Australians before tea. Britain used to do gymnastics in much the same way the Chinese did real tennis. Now, suddenly, we have our very own Olga Korbut, minus the red ribbons and primary school bunches but still a veritable media darling. At 24, Tweddle practically rates as a grandmother by comparison with the eastern European twiglets who used to flick-flack and somersault on to the podium. Moreover she swept the floor with her rivals, having crashed and burned in her preferred event, the uneven bars, a couple of days before. In February she underwent shoulder surgery, having narrowly missed out on a medal in Beijing. Her travails since taking up the sport as a hyperactive seven-year-old make even Button's 10-year wait for the Formula One title seem an easy ride. In all sorts of other ways, the success of our steel-willed heroine also deserves as much recognition as Button's high\u2011profile laps of honour. The latter may be the best thing to come out of Frome since Colin Dredge, the idiosyncratic Somerset seamer of blessed memory, and has come a long way from his boy-racer days when he drove the fastest go-kart in the west. But, sad to say, the sport he bestrides has become so discredited this year that even serious petrol-heads have begun to question their devotion. Outside Britain, let alone Somerset, you wonder how far Button's powers of perseverance will tilt the sporting world on its axis, particularly with the Flavio Briatore scandal still so fresh. Tweddle, on the other hand, is suddenly the can-do queen of a sport destined to be one of the centrepieces of the London Olympics. She will be 27 when the Games commence in 2012 but, regardless of her medal prospects, her latest achievement is a priceless gift for the organisers. Look, they can now say, it is possible to achieve anything in this country if you put your mind to it (and can afford the leotard). Never mind the fact that some of our elite gymnasts are still required to share hall space with toddler groups because of a continued lack of funding. The beauty of Tweddle is that she did not get where she is today by sitting on her petite backside eating doughnuts or posting risqu\u00e9 pictures on Facebook. In company with Tom Daley, Jessica Ennis and Victoria Pendleton, she has also proved that Britain can be highly competitive in disciplines which, traditionally, have been dominated by others. In a low-carbon emission, environmentally-aware world, there is also more mileage in gymnastics, diving, running and cycling than worshipping gas-guzzling billionaires. The only area where Button still holds the whip hand over Tweddle is in his playboy past. It is surely a positive that Britain finally has a world champion with an appreciation of the good things in life, as opposed to a monosyllabic, monkish automaton in a helmet. It also shows what a Japanese lingerie model can do for your lap-times. But once the partying is over, someone should invite Button to spend 30 seconds on a set of asymmetric bars. By the time they have scraped him off the crash mat and called an ambulance, Tweddle will have gained the limitless respect she deserves. Rugby's health warning just cannot be ignored For anyone who missed the weekend's Heineken Cup action, two trends are apparent in rugby union just now. The first is that margins are slimmer than they have ever been. The second is that the hits are now frighteningly big. Take a look at Matt Banahan's flattening of Mirco Bergamasco in the Bath v Stade Fran\u00e7ais game and the juggernaut impact of Henry Tuilagi on Ben Foden in Perpignan on Friday night. Then check out the footage of Andrew Sheridan's departure from the Sale-Cardiff encounter with a dislocated shoulder and the slow-motion replays of Saracens' Brad Barritt being knocked senseless in Toulon. The Banahan example is the most pertinent because it was widely regarded as a perfectly legal challenge. The only problem, according to those closest to the wreckage, was the 30kg difference in weight between the two players. Either way, it was a sign of the times. At the last count 11 of England's elite squad were unavailable for the start of the autumn Tests. The players cannot squeal in case they are perceived to be running scared. The rest of us have to make a call: do we sit wincing in the stand and continue to mutter about it being a man's game, or do we raise the alarm before a limp concussion victim fails to regain consciousness? To my mind, there is no longer any choice. The risks to players' health and wellbeing have become too glaring to ignore. Whale of a time for an enriching Christmas Good news for any mega-rich footballers wondering what to buy for Christmas. A Russian armoured-car builder has announced its latest luxury model, costing \u20ac1m, will feature the ultimate in travelling comfort for the well-heeled posterior, namely whale-penis leather seats. Apparently, the shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis used to own bar stools covered in the same material but this takes such idiocy to unprecedented levels. The bulletproof windows are gold-plated, the dashboard gauges are encrusted with diamonds and rubies and the exterior is coated with Kevlar. Liverpool's new secret defence mechanism Wasn't the \"beach ball goal\" fun? It's amazing to what lengths people will go for Comic Relief. And how delightful to discover the red inflatable was official Liverpool merchandise, available for a tenner along with a carry bag and a towel. To be used, presumably, for laying down in penalty areas before matches against German opposition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
