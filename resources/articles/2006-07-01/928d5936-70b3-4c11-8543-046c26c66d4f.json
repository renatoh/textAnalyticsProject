The Sussex leg-spinner was contacted this week by the Pakistan team manager Zaheer Abbas, who was keen to know whether he had recovered from the trapped nerve in his neck that had sidelined him since July 2. With their seam-bowling all-rounder Abdul Razzaq picking up a back injury at Lord's on Monday, Pakistan are keen to keep all options open for next week's second Test at Old Trafford, where the pitch traditionally smiles on the spinners. \"Zaheer called me to see if I'm OK,\" said the 36-year-old Mushtaq, who has played only twice for Pakistan in the past five years. \"I told him I'm fully fit and available, but I don't expect to hear any more until the end of the week.\" The Pakistan chairman of selectors Wasim Bari said: \"Inzamam-ul-Haq [the captain] knows Mushtaq better than anyone else. If he wants to play him because of special circumstances we will support him.\" If Mushtaq does get the call-up to form a three-man leg-spin attack in Manchester with Danish Kaneria and Shahid Afridi, Sussex will replace him with his compatriot and fellow leggie Imran Tahir, who played three championship matches for Middlesex in 2003 and has been turning out in the Staffordshire leagues and for Sussex's second XI this summer. Mushtaq himself recommended him to the county. Mushtaq is the competition's leading wicket-taker with 53 but he did not get the chance to add to his tally yesterday as Sussex overcame the early loss of both openers to Chris Silverwood to make hay in sweltering conditions against a Middlesex side who look an increasingly good bet for relegation. The latest nails in their coffin were hammered first by Mike Yardy and Murray Goodwin, who added 159 in 50 overs for the third wicket, and then by the Sussex captain Chris Adams, who completed a typically pugnacious hundred as the shadows lengthened. Yardy is left-handed and front-footed, Goodwin a right-hander who lingers on the back, but they seem destined to prove that opposites do indeed attract: this was the sixth time in two years they had shared a century partnership. Goodwin was run out for 69 by Eoin Morgan's sharp throw from mid-off, but not before he had moved past John Crawley as the First Division's top run-scorer. And after Yardy edged a drive off Johann Louw to fall for 97, the baton passed to Adams and Matt Prior, who was dropped twice on his way to a belligerent 43. Adams was playing only after passing a late fitness test on a bruised left hand but there was nothing half-hearted about the way he launched three straight sixes shortly before tea. Two of them came in one over off Jamie Dalrymple."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
