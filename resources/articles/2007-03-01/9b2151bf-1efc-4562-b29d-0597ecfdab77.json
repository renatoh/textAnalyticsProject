But Lawrence Power is such a superlative artist that the two Brahms sonatas seem less unwelcome in their viola guise than usual, even though the nutty, burnished sound of the stringed instrument never stands out against the piano so effectively as the wind instrument does. Power's playing is so full of imagination, sensitivity and gorgeously ample phrasing. Yet Brahms's Trio in A minor, Op 114, in which Power and pianist Simon Crawford-Phillips are joined by cellist Tim Hugh, fares less well in its viola arrangement. The second string instrument muddies the mid-range textures in a way that the original entirely avoids. One can admire, but not get swept away by, the performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
