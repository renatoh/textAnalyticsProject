No surprise, really. When it was announced that the Donmar Warehouse was to stage Othello starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ewan McGregor and Kelly Reilly, there was an instant run on the box office. Ejiofor, who plays the eponymous Moor, has a string of theatre credits including Joe Penhall's Blue/Orange and the leading role in the award-winning movie Dirty Pretty Things. While Star Wars alumnus McGregor - who plays the manipulative villain Iago and these days seems best known for tooling around the world on his motorbike - was last seen on the West End stage in the Michael Grandage (who also directs here) production of Guys And Dolls. Reilly (Desdemona) is one of our most riveting young stage actors, having appeared on stage in Piano/Forte and The Graduate, and has just been on TV in Stephen Poliakoff's Joe's Palace. Mark Cook \u00b7 Donmar Warehouse, WC2, Fri 30 to Feb 23 Noughts And Crosses Stratford- upon-Avon The stakes are certainly rising with family friendly theatre. The National has followed the hit show Coram Boy with War Horse and the Almeida has Marianne Dreams. But it could be the RSC that trumps them all with the stage premiere of Malorie Blackman's novel, a Romeo and Juliet-style love story set in a world where the powerful crosses are all black and the underclass the white noughts. Lyn Gardner \u00b7 Civic Hall, Thu 29 to Feb 2 The Water Babies Scarborough Charles Kingsley's tale of poor little chimney sweep Tom who jumps into a stream to cool his burned skin used to be on every child's bookshelf. This Victorian morality story can seem a little preachy to the modern child, but there is no doubt that parts of the story are still full of invention and enchantment. Perhaps it is coming back into fashion too. Northern Broadsides' adaptation keeps things simple as five actor-musicians play all the characters with some puppets. LG \u00b7 Stephen Joseph Theatre, Tue 27 to Dec 22 Rust Bristol The terrific adult puppeteers Green Ginger have been touring for 29 years and are feted all over the world, but are still too seldom seen in this country. So it's good to see them at the Tobacco Factory with a show that the Norwegians acclaimed as being \"part Sex Pistols, part Monty Python with a touch of the Young Ones\". Certainly there is always something wonderfully anarchic about Green Ginger's work, and this show won't be an exception. Set on two pirate radio stations, one in an ageing lighthouse and the other from a submarine, this is a rollicking tale that's billed as a \"dark comic book vision of low life on the high seas\". An inspired mix of art and lunacy. LG \u00b7 Tobacco Factory, Tue 27 to Dec 1 Exquisite Pain Eastleigh The Point at Eastleigh continues its ambitious programming, bringing Forced Entertainment down south for another dose of the company's beautiful and torturous account of the end of a love affair. Using a text by the French artist Sophie Calle, who uses her own life as an inspiration and an art in itself, the show takes the form of a man and a woman sitting in a room talking of heartbreak. The story remains the same but the details gradually become changed as the tale is told and retold in a process that is both healing and like scratching at a scab. This is not an easy piece to watch, but it rewards your attention and offers a terrifying, intimate look into the human heart and the way we deal with unbearable pain. LG \u00b7 The Point, Wed 27 &amp; Thu 28 Royal Shakespeare Company: Mixed Bill London Those who complain that the RSC has more or less abandoned London aside from an anual sojourn should be mollified over the coming months. This week, the company are opening several productions, and more are promised in the spring. First off, Trevor Nunn returns to the New London Theatre with a double bill of King Lear and Chekhov's The Seagull. With a cast led by Ian McKellen and Frances Barber performing in both plays, they run until January 12. Meanwhile, over at the Soho Theatre, the always fascinating Anthony Neilson directs his God In Ruins, which was commissioned by the RSC. It's a cautionary tale for all single men at Christmas, which arose out of improvising with 11 male RSC actors, and which follows a father's attempts to communicate with his daughter. MC \u00b7 Soho Theatre, W1, Thu 29 to Jan 5 Motherland Newcastle-upon-Tyne We've had some terrific shows in the last couple of years exploring the experience of ordinary soldiers in Iraq, most notably the brilliant Black Watch presented by the National Theatre Of Scotland, which will finally be heading into London later next year. But what about those who are left behind? The husbands, wives, lovers, children and friends of the servicemen and women who are serving in the Middle East. How do they cope with the waiting and the wondering? How do they cope with the news bulletins that report another unnamed soldier's death, and what happens when the loved one makes a long awaited return. A piece of verbatim theatre based on the real life stories of those connected with the Middle East conflict, this piece created and directed by Steve Gilroy brings the war back home. LG \u00b7 Live, Thu 29 to Dec 8 The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe Leeds The Playhouse had a popular hit with Ian Brown's colourful production back in 2004 and there's no reason why this revival shouldn't be another great night out for all the family. This version by the famed 1960s beat poet Adrian Mitchell is the one commissioned by the RSC almost a decade ago. It stays straight and true to the classic story by CS Lewis of four children who discover a wondrous and exciting world ruled over by the icy White Witch lurking behind the old fur coats in a seemingly ordinary wardrobe. You go along to this knowing exactly what it is that you are going to get: a big, handsomely staged version of a familiar tale following the adventures of the four siblings - Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund - as they fight together on the side of the great lion Aslan to ensure that the thaw happens and that Christmas can come again.
