Antiques, squashy sofas, swagged curtains? Well, yes, there is plenty of that, but it was overhauled recently by the woman who did the Clarence in Dublin, so now it's a bit more of a mix, old blending with the new to create a harmonious... So it's nice then? Well, nice isn't quite the word. It's elegant and plush and is one of the last bastions of traditional hospitality in Paris, with a contemporary twist. It's bang in the middle of town, just off the Champs Elys\u00e9es, but peaceful. V good breakfast, by the way. What are the rooms like? Very pretty. There are 60 (though the hotel feels smaller, in a good way), including 11 suites. The Marlene Dietrich suite, below, so named because the singer apparently lived at the hotel for three years during the Thirties, is a festival of lilac and purple - her favourite colours - and looks out on to the hotel's pretty courtyard garden. Ours, at the top of the building, was an abundance of ancien regime grandeur: wall-to-wall marble in the bathroom, unbelievably sumptuous bed linen, two widescreen TVs, a CD player, bunches of fresh roses and a view from the balcony across the rooftops to Sacre Coeur... what was it about letting them eat cake? The only odd thing in this sea of perfect planning was the lavatory - it was tiny. So tiny that you couldn't actually sit on the loo and shut the door at the same time. And Paris? Elegant as ever. Stroll until your legs can take no more, and then jump on a river cruiser. The trip takes in just about every landmark, with the bonus of offering up a smattering of facts to take home to impress your friends. Did you know, for example, that if you stood for a few seconds in front of every painting in the Louvre, it would take you three months to get round the museum? What about prices? Best not to worry too much about arms and legs. Doubles start at \u00a3248, suites start at \u00a3475 and go up to an eye-watering \u00a31,000 a night. \u00b7 Hotel Lancaster, 6 rue de Berri, Champs Elys\u00e9es, 75008 Paris (00 33 1 40764076)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
