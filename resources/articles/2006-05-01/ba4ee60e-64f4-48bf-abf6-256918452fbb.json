I can no longer bear to watch images on television of starving children. Suddenly, it feels so much more real. My heart grieved to hear the stories related by Decca Aitkenhead about children terrorised by their dads (The sins of fathers, May 8). I didn't find it difficult to believe her revelations of the legal system failing to protect children from paternal abuse. We know how long it took the system to root out abuse in children's homes. It sanctioned the movement of hundreds of children to often miserable lives in Australia in the 1950s. We recall how young children have been removed from jailed mothers by an insensitive prison system. The state, over-confident about protecting children's best interests, typically makes a serious mistake in children's policy every generation. So, when it comes to children, we should never take it on trust that the system knows best. We need to hear the dreadful stories, expose the incompetence. Why, then, do I feel so let down by this article? Because this worthy exposure of the truth about abuse was used to deny another great injustice to children. The article's message was plain: first, the courts occasionally turn a blind eye to domestic violence and child abuse (true); second, the claim that many children are prevented from seeing their dads after separation is therefore groundless (untrue). Thus, the article bravely exposed one children's scandal, only to sink low by using it to suppress the truth of another. It is tempting to slip into these false polarities. Focusing solely on domestic violence and child abuse by some fathers places the argument firmly in the easily understandable realm of gender conflict. Fathers4Justice made precisely the same mistake by focusing solely on fathers denied contact with their children. But we must rise above gender conflict and recognise the full picture. That picture includes a failure to honour children's relationships with their fathers. So, although the courts do indeed only rarely deny all contact, the contact awarded is usually inadequate and poorly enforced. Crucially, separating parents receive little help in maintaining arrangements that ensure their children enjoy positive relationships with both mum and dad. We should expose both scandals - of abuse and of children denied contact with their dads. Last week the entire \"family sector\" did just that. We gathered together - representatives of the women's movement, children's charities, fatherhood groups and leading academics - at the Cabinet Office lobbying the government for a new approach to separated families. The radical, joint policy would create a network of services to help parents so that their children got the best out of both of them. This includes taking domestic violence and abuse more seriously. Anything less than this sophisticated, holistic approach will fail children so damaged by traumatic separations. Family organisations have moved on and are more wary of mirroring the poisonous antipathies of warring couples. Can we all now catch up, and abandon comfortable polarities in favour of properly tackling a complex set of injustices? \u00b7 Jack O'Sullivan is a co-founder of Fathers Direct, the National Information Centre on Fatherhood j.osullivan@fathersdirect.com \u00b7 If you wish to respond, at greater length than in a letter, to an article in which you have featured either directly or indirectly, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
