In the wake of Friday night's draw and the largest batch yet of almost 1m tickets going on sale yesterday, the organising committee chief executive, Danny Jordaan, said that South Africans needed to wake up to the fact that they would miss out. Now the draw has been made, fans around the world are expected to snap up the most attractive tickets. Although just over half of the tickets sold to date have been bought by South Africans, there is increasing concern that they will miss out to overseas fans and touts. A culture of buying on the day, a lack of credit cards and low internet penetration have all been blamed. But many believe the tickets are too expensive for ordinary fans. The cheapest category of 140 rand (\u00a311) are reserved for South African citizens, but that is still seven times the average price for a South African Premier League match. South Africa, struggling to convince a sceptical public of their credentials after several lacklustre performances, will kick off the first World Cup on African soil against Mexico on 11 June. \"The Mexicans will arrive in massive numbers. The only thing we don't want is for there to be more Mexican fans than South African fans,\" said Jordaan, a driving force behind bringing the World Cup to South Africa. \"The late purchasing of tickets is over. You are competing against English fans, Dutch fans who are sitting on the internet applying for your tickets. We want it to be a special celebration on that opening night.\"\"The price of 140 rand is, I think, a pretty good price and is the cheapest of any World Cup. The habit to buy late has been fuelled over many years, but they have never found themselves in this position where they need to compete with the whole world for a ticket. They need to change their behaviour.\" Hopes are high that an African team can reach the latter stages of the competition, given the strength of Ivory Coast and Ghana, but Jordaan warned that the problem was affecting supporters of all teams on the continent. \"It's not just South Africa, it's Africa. We were sitting with the five African teams yesterday and they were making the same point,\" he said. Fifa has responded by investing $500,000 (\u00a3300,000) in a call centre to sell tickets to South Africans over the phone and ploughing up to $400,000 into ticket booths in city centres. Jordaan said South Africa's chances of avoiding the fate of becoming the first hosts to be knocked out in the group stage and escaping from a tough group would be enhanced if South African fans backed their team. \"Our fans must be there, it will be sad if we only get a few fans. That could make the difference,\" he told the Observer. \"We saw in Korea/Japan, in France that the home fans, with passionate support, can really lift the performance of the team.\" Around a third of the total of more than 3.7m tickets is reserved for Fifa sponsors and partners and the national associations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
