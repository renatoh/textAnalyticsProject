Both parties had lodged claims and counter-claims totalling more than \u00a350m, alleging that the other had effected a \"repudiatory\" breach of contract that had damaged their working relationship beyond repair. But the judge Mr Justice Jackson, sitting in the technology and construction court division of the high court, urged the two companies to settle their remaining claims out of court after he made a series of preliminary rulings yesterday. Multiplex holds CBUK culpable for much of the delay that led to the 2006 FA Cup final being moved to Cardiff - a fate that may yet befall the 2007 date - but the Darlington-based steel firm insisted it holds a contract limiting its liability to \u00a36m. \"The result is helpful and should now allow both parties to reach an early resolution of the remaining issues we now have in dispute,\" said a spokeswoman for CBUK yesterday. It is understood that Multiplex will now apply for part payment of its costs in the trial and the Australian construction firm is already believed to be preparing litigation against a number of other subcontractors that have worked with it on the project. Yesterday's ruling will help to mitigate Multiplex's losses, which had been expected to exceed \u00a3180m on a \u00a3445m fixed-price contract. Though the judge stated that neither party could claim an \"outright victory\", Multiplex expects now to pursue others it considers to have contributed to its massive deficit, and is not ruling out a suit against the Football Association's wholly owned subsidiary, the stadium operator Wembley National Stadium Limited. Among the more ridiculous revelations that emerged during the course of the trial was the journey of one consignment of raw steel that had been shipped to China for fabrication, only to be returned to the UK for Wembley. \"The Chinese authorities were puzzled as to why a large quantity of steel was shipped halfway round the world, only to be sent back to the UK,\" said the judge. \"At one stage, they suspected a smuggling operation.\" Nevertheless after months of adverse publicity Mr Justice Jackson sought to offer reassurance that the national stadium is an outstanding venue in the making. \"Having visited the site, I have no doubt it will be a world-class sports stadium,\" he said. \"Long after these present problems, all parties can take pride in what they have created.\" The case was adjourned until today, when CBUK will be given leave to appeal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
