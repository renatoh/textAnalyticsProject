Victory over the Italians will ensure the Scots avoid the wooden spoon. \"There were a lot of good things against England which we feel we can drive forward,\" McGeechan said. \"At the weekend it flattered England. There were things in there which we probably could have avoided [but] you have got to look at performances and not get carried away with results, whether they are wins or losses. \"Italy have shown they are a strong, physical side and we have to play well for 85 minutes. It is no good playing just in parts of games, which is something we are very conscious of. If we get it right, hopefully it will show in the game.\" Italy have named L'Aquila's Andrea Masi in the centre, with the experienced Paolo Vaccari moving on to the wing after his nightmare game in their 53-27 defeat by France. France has confirmed it will stage pool matches in Scotland, Wales and Ireland if its bid to host the 2007 World Cup is successful. The decision of the French Rugby Federation to include the Celtic nations in its final plans effectively cancels out one of the chief bargaining tools of its rival bidder England. The FFR yesterday committed itself to take games to Murrayfield, the Millennium Stadium and Lansdowne Road as its president Bernard Lapasset presented the final bid in Paris. The International Rugby Board will choose the hosts next month but it now seems that, whatever the outcome, Scotland, Wales and Ireland will have the chance to play games at home. Each would stage pool matches under the French proposal, with Wales also putting on one of the quarter-finals. \"There is one novelty as from the original draft,\" said Lapasset, whose bid includes 13 venues. \"We wish to open the match hosting to other countries from the northern hemisphere. The World Cup is not only the World Cup of one country, but the opportunity to honour the development of rugby and allow other nations to take advantage of the profit generated by this World Cup.\" Scotland: Metcalfe (Glasgow); Paterson (Edinburgh), McLaren (Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles), Craig (Orrell), Logan (Wasps); Townsend (Borders), Redpath (Sharks, capt); Smith (Northampton), Bulloch (Glasgow), Douglas (Borders), Murray , Hines (both Edinburgh), White (Glasgow), Taylor (Edinburgh), Mower (Newcastle).
