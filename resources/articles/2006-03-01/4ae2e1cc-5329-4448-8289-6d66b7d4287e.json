The supermarket everyone hates to love has engaged a Yankee strategy firm to canvass British \"opinion makers\" about their views on Tesco. Part of Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP empire, Washington-based Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland Associates wants to know how Tesco can improve its reputation. Advisers to Microsoft and Bill Clinton, PSB boasts that it helped elect a US president and 20 foreign heads of state. Just imagine what it can do for Tesco's boss, Terry Leahy. \u00b7 Speaking of Tesco, it's a case of what goes around, comes around for Vodafone's chairman, Lord MacLaurin, who succeeded Leslie Porter, the son-in-law of Tesco founder Jack Cohen, as chairman of the supermarket group 20 years ago. Once at the top, MacLaurin refused to make room for the founding family on the Tesco board, denying Leslie's wife, Dame Shirley, and their son, John, a seat at the table. We wonder if the Lord of Knebworth feels some belated sympathy for the Cohens, now that Vodafone's new guard, led by chief exec Arun Sarin, is trying to push him out. \u00b7 Or maybe not, given that MacLaurin didn't have too many kind words to say about Dame Shirley back in his explosive 1999 memoir, Tiger by the Tail. Then he called the Tory politician, who came to grief at Westminster council, a \"regular martinet\" and a \"sorcerer's apprentice\" who was obsessed with power. Ten years on, we think it's time for Tiger by the Tail Part II so we can find out what MacLaurin really thinks of Arun Sarin and co. \u00b7 The past of Sir David Arculus, the new president of the CBI, came back to haunt him this week, when Severn Trent was found guilty of giving false information to the water regulator. Arculus was Severn Trent chairman at the time customers were overcharged by \u00a342m. He also chaired the Better Regulation Taskforce, where he pushed the line that \"the best business regulation is no regulation\". The regulators are having the last laugh, with a multimillion-pound fine for Severn Trent in the offing. \u00b7 The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir John Gieve, has finished his rapid review of security following the \u00a353m Tonbridge robbery. With the aid of police experts and security specialists, an array of improvements has been identified to ensure the nation's lolly is better protected next time. So what defects did Sir John pinpoint? \"We're not going into specifics,\" a Bank spokesman says. \"We're not in the business of producing a Rough Guide to Bank Robbery.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
