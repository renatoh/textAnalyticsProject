That, at least, is one conclusion to draw from Charlotte Greig's play The Confessions (2.15pm, Radio 4), which begins with a woman walking into a Cardiff auction house holding a priceless Turner sketch. The drawing is an inheritance and, as it's a little smutty and its new owner something of a prude, not an entirely welcome one. Luke, the Bad Man behind the counter, realises the woman has no idea what she has, and buys it for just \u00a350. Pausing only to make an accomplice of his girlfriend, Catrin, he then flies to Geneva, where he thinks they can sell it without too many questions. Once in Switzerland, however, Luke and Catrin discover that the people they must deal with are at least as flawed as they are ... Lynne Seymour and Clive Standen star. Elsewhere, Tony Haynes directs the Grand Union Orchestra in Performance On 3 (7pm, Radio 3). A pregnant woman in a church imagines the future of her unborn baby and ponders the history of East End immigration in Haynes's own music drama, Now Comes the Dragon's Hour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
