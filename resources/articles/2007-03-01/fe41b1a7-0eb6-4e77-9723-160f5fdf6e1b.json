I'm enjoying the course, but it wasn't in my original plan. When I was 14, I got a two-year contract with Nottingham Forest FC. I thought I had my future mapped out, but then I was released from the club. I was devastated. The experience taught me that I needed to be more realistic. The tutors encourage us to get coaching qualifications. I've now got an FA level 1 football-coaching certificate and a community sports leader award, which means I can coach young people in football and other sports under the supervision of a qualified coach. This has led to paid work in my local sports centre and running holiday clubs for children. I love working with children. Last year, I was lucky enough to go to South Africa with the football squad to compete in a tournament and take part in a scheme called Balls to Poverty, which aims to get young people from the UK involved in projects in Africa. As well as coaching children, we distributed over 3,000 footballs across Soweto, Pretoria and Cape Town. South Africa was a real eye-opener for me. Most of the kids have nothing, but they've always got a smile on their face. We coached one girls' team of eight- to 12-year-olds whose makeshift pitch didn't even have any grass. Some children were playing barefoot. The experience made me appreciate all the opportunities I've had in the UK. \u00b7 James Burke is a student on the BTec national diploma in sport development and fitness at South Nottingham College.
