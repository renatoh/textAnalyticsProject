Trump told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday he had been due to meet the Prince of Wales for 15 minutes during his state visit, but the discussion went on for 90 minutes \u2013 during which the prince did \u201cmost of the talking\u201d. Trump said: \u201cHe is really into climate change and I think that\u2019s great. What he really wants and what he really feels warmly about is the future. He wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good climate, as opposed to a disaster, and I agree.\u201d But Trump said he pushed back at the suggestion the US should do more. He said: \u201cI did say, \u2018Well, the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are based on all statistics.\u2019 And it\u2019s even getting better because I agree with that we want the best water, the cleanest water. It\u2019s crystal clean, has to be crystal clean clear.\u201d Trump added: \u201cChina, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water, and the sense of pollution. If you go to certain cities \u2026 you can\u2019t even breathe, and now that air is going up \u2026 They don\u2019t do the responsibility.\u201d Asked by Piers Morgan if he accepted the science on climate change, Trump said: \u201cI believe there\u2019s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways. Don\u2019t forget, it used to be called global warming, that wasn\u2019t working, then it was called climate change. Now it\u2019s actually called extreme weather, because with extreme weather you can\u2019t miss.\u201d Morgan did not ask Trump about his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. And Trump swerved a question about whether the Prince of Wales had persuaded him to move his stance on the climate crisis. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what moved me is his passion for future generations,\u201d Trump said. During the interview \u2013 Trump\u2019s third with Morgan since his inauguration \u2013 the president said he had not called the Duchess of Sussex \u201cnasty\u201d in an interview with the Sun before his visit. But he added: \u201cWhat she said was nasty based on what they told me.\u201d Trump also appeared to backtrack on his earlier claim that the NHS was \u201con the table\u201d in a post-Brexit trade deal, telling Morgan he did not see the cherished institution as \u201cpart of trade\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything\u2019s up for negotiation because everything is, but I don\u2019t see it being on the table. That\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t consider part of trade, that\u2019s not trade,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, the president sparked uproar after telling reporters at a press conference alongside Theresa May that US companies should have market access to every sector of the British economy as part of any post-Brexit trade deal, including the NHS. Trump\u2019s statement drew immediate condemnation from several Conservative leadership hopefuls as well as senior Labour politicians. There are widespread concerns in the UK about US firms promising to provide cost-cutting health services and wanting to sell food produced to lower environmental and animal welfare standards, such as chlorine-washed chicken. In his interview, Trump also softened his stance towards Jeremy Corbyn after telling Tuesday\u2019s press conference he had rejected a request to meet the Labour leader, whom he called a \u201cnegative force\u201d. Trump said a future meeting with Corbyn was \u201calways possible\u201d. He said: \u201cHe wanted to meet. It was very tough to meet and probably inappropriate to meet, to be honest with you.\u201d And Trump said the chance of Corbyn winning the next election was a \u201clong shot\u201d. Trump also gave some further views on the Conservative leadership candidates, repeating that he did not know Michael Gove despite the fact Gove interviewed Trump for the Times in 2017. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know him. I met him last night at the dinner for the first time. I thought he was very good. You have a lot of good people running. I was saying to the Queen last night, the choice of your next prime minister is very important.\u201d He went on to lavish more praise on Boris Johnson, whom he has previously described as a friend, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who has reportedly become close to Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said of Johnson: \u201cI do think he\u2019s a good person. I think it\u2019s going to be a very interesting \u2026 But they\u2019re good people. They\u2019re good people, and Jeremy\u2019s very good. I\u2019ve gotten to know Jeremy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
