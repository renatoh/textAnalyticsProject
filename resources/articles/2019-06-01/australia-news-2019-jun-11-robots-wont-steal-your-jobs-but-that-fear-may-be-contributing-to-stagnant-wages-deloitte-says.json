At the National Press Club on Wednesday, Deloitte partner Chris Richardson will argue that improving technology is shifting the mix of skills in demand with employers but fears of mass unemployment are \u201centirely misplaced\u201d. In the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Richardson says despite technological change accelerating for decades, unemployment is \u201cclose to record lows around the world\u201d \u2013 including the US, UK and Australia. \u201cSo if you feared that new technologies would lead to mass unemployment \u2026 it just isn\u2019t happening. \u201cNew technologies are improving what workers do rather than replacing those workers overall.\u201d Richardson compares fears that robots will \u201csteal\u201d jobs with fears that migrants would do the same \u2013 or married women \u2013 in times past. \u201cBut new technologies create as many jobs as they kill,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the ones they kill are obvious, while the ones they create are hiding in plain sight.\u201d Richardson says the predicted trend of Australians having \u201cheaps of jobs\u201d over their career has not eventuated. \u201cAlmost half \u2013 45% of all workers in Australia \u2013 have been with their current employer more than five years. \u201cAnd the average Australian worker has been in their current job for almost five months longer than was true just a decade ago.\u201d Nor has work in the gig economy and working from home replaced traditional modes of employment, he says. \u201cFinally, you can\u2019t blame technology for the lack of wage growth in Australia and around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite that\u2019s true \u2026 better technologies make workers more valuable and that leads to them getting higher wages.\u201d Richardson cites the fact that countries with the most technology per worker also have the highest pay. He suggests that workers and employers are \u201cgetting more worried about what the future may bring\u201d and fear of the future \u201cmay well be one of the main reasons why wage growth isn\u2019t acting the same way that it used to\u201d. \u201cAll around the world a given level of unemployment is generating less by way of wage gains. That\u2019s partly because the rise of the robots \u2026 [has] workers more worried than they should be.\u201d Australia has experienced six years of well-below-average wage growth, although wages ticked up to annual growth of 2.3% in the last quarter. Research by the Australian National University has found there is \u201ca not insignificant minority of workers who worry about automation\u201d although this is \u201cless of a concern than other sources\u201d of displacement. It found that workers are more concerned about their employer finding someone overseas who is willing to perform their job for less money, with 14.8% very concerned by the prospect. On Wednesday Deloitte will release a report titled The Path to Prosperity: Why the Future of Work is Human, suggesting that in the future jobs will require fewer manual skills and more cognitive skills. More than 80% of jobs created between now and 2030 will be for knowledge workers, and two-thirds will be strongly reliant on soft skills, it says. The growing demand for workers performing \u201cnon-routine\u201d tasks with their heads as opposed to \u201croutine\u201d tasks with their hands will see the most jobs growth in female-dominated industries. Australian science agency the CSIRO has suggested that automation of low-skilled jobs will leave human workers free to do more complex jobs, with titles such as remote-controlled vehicle operators or online chaperones. Richardson suggests the government should help workers fill their skills gaps through measures including lifelong learning. He also warns against \u201cpolicy mistakes\u201d such as attempting to impose a tax on robots as proposed by Bill Gates and in Europe, arguing such a measure would \u201csimply lower wage gains\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
