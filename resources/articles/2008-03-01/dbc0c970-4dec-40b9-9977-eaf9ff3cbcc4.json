How monstrous? In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book and in articles for the Atlantic Monthly and the Washington Post, Power charged Bill Clinton and his administration with disingenuously standing aside while genocide was carried out in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Though Power - who resigned as Obama's chief foreign-policy adviser for her indiscretion - has said nothing to suggest that her description of Hillary Clinton was anything other than political hyperbole, her past writings raise the possibility that she was, in fact, expressing deeply felt revulsion. As is well known, Bill Clinton apologised floridly for his inaction during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Yet, in a devastating description Power offered in the Atlantic in September 2001, Clinton comes off as someone who cynically offered up his remorse for the lesser sin of not knowing in order to escape judgment for the far greater sin of knowing but not acting. \"With the grace of one grown practiced at public remorse,\" Power wrote, \"the president gripped the lectern with both hands and looked across the dais at the Rwandan officials and survivors who surrounded him. Making eye contact and shaking his head, he explained, 'It may seem strange to you here, especially the many of you who lost members of your family, but all over the world there were people like me sitting in offices, day after day after day, who did not fully appreciate [pause] the depth [pause] and the speed [pause] with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror.' \" Power added, almost anticlimactically: \"In order not to appreciate that genocide or something close to it was under way, US officials had to ignore public reports and internal intelligence and debate.\" Her article became part of her Pulitzer-winning book, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide. In reviewing the book for the New York Times, Laura Secor reported that Power had concluded that President Clinton was \"an amoral narcissist\", which a good dictionary might describe as - well, as a \"monster\". Power's moral outrage was on display again in April 2002, when she wrote in the Washington Post that Clinton-administration officials had wilfully done nothing during the mass murder of Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995 - even going so far as to refuse to change the flight path of a surveillance satellite so as not to learn more about the homicidal activities of the Bosnian Serb strongman Ratko Mladic than they were willing to act upon. \"After the massacre, neither the Clinton team nor Congress looked back,\" Power continued. \"I have found no evidence that Clinton commissioned an internal after-action review of the US response to Srebrenica. The Senate had individual members - Joseph Biden, Bob Dole, Joseph Lieberman, John McCain and others - who took principled stands throughout the Bosnian war, urging intervention. But Congress never summoned Clinton administration officials to Capitol Hill to publicly answer for being bystanders to mass murder.\" Interestingly, and perhaps tellingly, Power makes virtually no mention of Hillary Clinton in A Problem from Hell. If Power believes the first lady's views differed from those of the president, she doesn't say so. Indeed, in one of the few references to Mrs Clinton, Power recounts a story about her giving her husband a copy of Robert Kaplan's book Balkan Ghosts, which \"portrays people in the Balkans as if they were destined to hate and kill.\" Of course, it's possible to make too much of all this. Last October, Power told public television's Charlie Rose that Hillary Clinton would make \"a great president\", adding: \"I have only met her once, and I find her very, very affable and actually very intellectually curious and not ideological.\" Perhaps those statements represent what Power really thinks. But in other contexts, Power has made it clear that she believes the Clinton administration's policies led to monstrous - and foreseeable - crimes against humanity. I had a chance to interview Power in 2003 for a symposium on the future of the Middle East, and found her to be both brilliant and charming. If Obama is elected president, there's a good chance she'll be back. Her views about what the Clinton administration should and could have done to prevent genocide may prove to be naive if and when an Obama White House faces its own foreign-policy crises. But there's little doubt that Clintonian cynicism, masked as idealism, helped make two of the most monstrous events of the 1990s worse than they had to be. Maybe that's what Power was really saying last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
