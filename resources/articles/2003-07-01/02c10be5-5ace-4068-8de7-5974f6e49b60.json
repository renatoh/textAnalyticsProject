I believe I'm capable of winning all four majors. That would put me up there with Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Some people might say that's outrageous but I don't think I should be knocked for speaking my mind. I know it's not going to happen for a while. But that's my aim. You can make a great living on tour playing mediocre golf. But I'm preparing for something bigger. I'm getting ready to shoot for the majors.\" This week's Open, beginning at Royal St George's on Thursday, will be only the fourth major of Casey's embryonic career. His three previous appearances at this stellar level of golf have been less than glittering. Having played the 2002 Open and USPGA, and in last month's US Open, the 25-year-old from Weybridge has yet to make the cut in a major. \"Fourth time lucky?\" Casey says more ruefully. \"It's a shock to the system when you first play a major. But this will be my second Open. There'll be no excuses this time round. I might not have the experience to win it but, this weekend, I want to go out late on Saturday and Sunday, when the crowds are huge and you're amongst the best players. I want a taste of that.\" Casey is part of a select group of young English players - including Justin Rose, Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Nick Dougherty - who have become accustomed to speaking with such bold ambition. They not only see themselves as natural major-winning successors to Nick Faldo but plan to impose themselves on world golf with a style and ease rarely associated with their famously taciturn English predecessor. Yet Faldo, once the most remorseless loner in this solitary game, carved out an extraordinary legacy. He won six majors, including three Opens. The new gang of English golfers have a long road to travel before they match that, even with a combined haul. Faldo's hopeful heirs prepared for the trials of Royal St George's by struggling with the glorious and exacting vagaries of playing golf at Loch Lomond. While Ernie Els prepared perfectly for the defence of his Open championship with a masterly 17-under-par total of 267, behind him a close-knit quartet of aspiring, yet callow, English golfers met with contrasting fortunes. There were moments of daring and hubris, of pathos and drama, but the real story binding them together was their shared fervour to make it to the Kent coast this week, and a small town called Sandwich, with the dream that, even if they don't touch the claret jug on Sunday, they might compete for it in the company of Woods, Els and even Faldo. Casey and Rose, ranked 29th and 34th in the world last week, ahead of the more modestly rated Faldo, creaking along at 62, are now officially regarded as the two best players in England. Their presence in the 2003 Open has been assured for months. They are joined on that exclusive list by their former amateur team-mate Donald, who plays the US tour. Rather than appearing at Loch Lomond, Donald secured his own automatic place in the Open with two hugely impressive rounds of 65 and 69 in this month's Western Open, won by Woods. Poulter and Dougherty have endured the greater strain. They both needed to finish sufficiently high on the Scottish leaderboard to gain exemption from the tortuous final qualifying rounds of the Open which began yesterday and will conclude this afternoon. Despite sharply distinct outcomes, Poulter and Dougherty approached their task at Loch Lomond with a verve and passion which has come to symbolise their group of players. \"This generation is very different,\" confirms Peter McEvoy, their England amateur captain who also managed memorable Walker Cup victories over the United States in 1999 and 2001. \"They're extremely bright and compelling. They seem without negativity. And against the Americans they have none of that old inferiority complex. This is a clear consequence of the team golf we've played recently. From the Walker Cup to the Ryder Cup, we're ahead of America over the last 15 years. This has bred real self-assurance. \"When I played in the mid-70s we were humiliated in the Ryder Cup. This group are used to beating the Americans. They won't all win the Open or the Masters but one or two of them are on their way to achieving that goal. They're that good.\" Rose, fourth in the 1998 Open and an even more creditable fifth in this year's US Open, and Donald, the only European golfer to win a US Tour event in his rookie season, appear the likeliest candidates. Yet Casey and Poulter exude even more obvious confidence. Dougherty, the youngest of the quintet at 21, is described by McEvoy as \"the most talented of them all\". This season, after two victories on the European Tour, and with on-course earnings over the past six months in excess of \u00a3600,000, Casey lies fourth in the order of merit. Yesterday he completed an initially inconsistent but ultimately solid 277, seven under, to finish tied for 10th. His future challenge to Els and Woods, however, has its roots in ability rather than fantasy. When he withstood a last-day charge from Padraig Harrington to win the B&amp;H International comfortably at the Belfry in May, Casey followed a double bogey on the 14th with an audacious birdie at 15, hitting a drive and a three-wood of such quality that afterwards he calmly said: \"I defy anyone to hit two better shots.\" Casey shrugs when reminded of that claim. \"The usual English self-effacement annoys me. I say what I believe. I've always had that attitude. The others are the same. Luke [Donald] might be quieter than the rest of us but he's very sure of his game. He has a strong mind - just like Justin [Rose]. We go back a long way. Ten years ago Justin played for Hampshire and I was with Surrey. I'd knock it way past him but he was more reliable with his chipping and putting. He was very professional even then.\" Rose became the first of the group to spring to national prominence with his dashing display, as an amateur, in the 1998 Open. \"I was part of the crowd following him at Birkdale,\" Casey remembers, \"and I was really happy for him. Maybe there was a twinge of envy, but I turned it into a positive - if Justin can do it, so can I. We now spend 30 weeks together on tour. I might only have dinner with Justin once a year but we all feed off each other. The four or five of us have a special bond. These guys are going to be part of my golfing life for a long time.\" Poulter, a self-confessed \"Hertfordshire homeboy - straight outta Stevenage\", is the maverick of the group. \"Poulter is Poulter,\" Casey laughs. \"He's a great player - at times. Away from the course, he's Jack-the-lad.\" Casey, sitting on a trailer step at Loch Lomond, stops in mid-flow. \"Speak of the devil,\" he eventually says, before he and a passing Poulter swap ritual insults with the odd imitation of a barking seal thrown in for good measure. \"That's a typical exchange,\" Casey confirms after Poulter has shown off the red streaks he has added - \"\u00e0 la Freddie Ljungberg, mate\" - to his tufty shock of peroxide hair. \"Poulter is a nutcase. He's a good guy to hang around when you're looking for fun. But you'd better ask him if he thinks that helps his golf.\" For all the bonhomie at Loch Lomond, an intense competitiveness lends an edge to the group's complex relationship. Their often suffocating proximity to one another in the surreal setting of a golf tour adds to the ambivalence. It is hard to miss the cracks when they spend so much time on the road. They were often all out on the driving range in the rainy dawn of Loch Lomond, standing shoulder to shoulder in a long lean row of swivelling hips and swinging clubs as they struck their buckets of little white balls in straight lines so perfect and separate that they suddenly looked impossibly isolated from one another. And when they hunch over their individual putters on the crowded practice greens, or eat and drink and josh in the crammed players' lounge, the reality that they are constantly competing against one another for money and glory is seldom far from the surface. \"The world rankings might say different,\" Poulter suggests later, \"but there's no doubt my great mate Justin is a better player than Paul Casey. Don't get me wrong, Casey's very good, but even though I'm 80-odd in the world rankings I like to think I'm No2 in England to Justin. I've had four wins on tour, Casey's had three. I'm intimidated by no one - from Tiger to Ernie. Last year, in Italy, I shot 11 under with a 61. This year, in the British Masters, I shot 63. I missed five short putts along the way; I was gutted not to shoot 58. When I'm on, I promise you, I can go berserk.\" Mixing those prodigious rounds with some haphazard play, Poulter's inconsistency meant that he needed a big week at Loch Lomond to guarantee his entry at Royal St George's. He eventually carded 275, nine under, to finish tied for fifth. He will be going to Sandwich after all. \"I'm dying to play the Open again,\" he says. \"Last year I was ninth after two rounds when, like Tiger, I got screwed by the weather. This coming week will be another massive chance for me at the Open. I plan on taking it.\" Born in Hitchin, raised in Stevenage \"and now kicking back in Milton Keynes\", Poulter shatters the stiff old archetype of English golf. \"I took some piss-taking in Stevenage. When I lugged my clubs round from class to class, all the kids said I was barking mad. They thought golf was a poncy sport. A game for twats and toffs. I was a good footballer, a centre-forward, but I was mad for golf. Look who's laughing now.\" Describing himself as \"a mad Gooner\", the Arsenal-obsessed Poulter counts Ray Parlour and Lee Dixon as two friends away from golf. \"Lee lives just down the road and we're great mates. He's a headcase like me. We race cars on a track whenever we can. We're adrenalin-junkies. We love the speed.\" Although he is especially close to Rose on tour, Poulter admits that \"Justin's much more sensible. But we make each other laugh and, in the fashionable stakes, I've always got young Nick to help me shake up things.\" Nick Dougherty is another refreshing presence on the European tour. Breaking off from talking about his \"awesome and fantastically lovely new girlfriend\" and his secret yearning to \"one day become an actor as cool as Steve McQueen\", Dougherty laments the fact that \"I've now had to take red out of my repertoire of colours. I was streaking my hair red months before Poulter copied me. I'm going to have to cook up something a little original. It's a change from the usual golf problems.\" Dougherty emulated Poulter and Casey, the previous two winners, by becoming last year's European Rookie of the Year. \"I'm still getting over it,\" he admits. \"I went crazy and played 33 tournaments and then went to Australia at the end of the season and played three more events. It seemed cool at the time. But it led to me getting glandular fever and so, now, I'm in a bloody horrible slump.\" Before Loch Lomond, Dougherty had missed five of the past six cuts. \"It's brutal. It's messing with my head. I won my first tournament, an under-14 event, when I was six. I was in the senior England team at 16, holder of the world junior title at 17 and a Walker Cup winner at 19. These last six weeks have been a real shock. It hits you in the face when you keep going home early on Friday.\" Last Wednesday afternoon, Dougherty consoled himself with the memory of his previous weekend. \"Well, I'd missed the cut again so I took my girlfriend back home to meet the parents. Yeah, that old daunting trip! But of course they absolutely loved her. So I came to Scotland in a great mood. And on a day like this, when the sun shines, Loch Lomond is such a beautiful spot and an amazing golf course. It feels like heaven on earth - especially if I get the score I need to make the Open.\" Dougherty, having slipped out of the order of merit's top 100, was reduced to playing in the very first group, teeing off at 7.30 the following morning. The weather took a sudden and drastic turn. As a dark mist rolled down across the Loch, he paced around the first tee, adding to the brooding atmosphere as he puffed away at a cigarette while reassuring us that \"I feel fine, I feel OK\". It was a poignant reminder that, for all their brash confidence, even this new breed of pro is not immune from golf's capacity to engender a terrible sense of vulnerability in its most gifted players. Dougherty briefly led the field at one under, an obviously illusory position which was only extended by a two-hour rain break after seven holes of play. He quickly dropped a couple of shots and ended the day on 73, two over par. He fared even worse on Friday - shooting 75 - to miss yet another cut. He now has to try to withstand another rigorous test during today's final qualifying session for the Open at the North Foreland course in Kent. If he prevails, he will have drawn on the resolve shown by his contemporaries. \"Rose and Casey are fantastic players,\" he says, \"but they're mentally very strong. Poulter oozes confidence, with a yard-dog spirit. And Luke Donald's the toughest of all. He was my Walker Cup partner and he was relentless. We called him the Silent Assassin. I know I can come back and be up there with them. I just need one hot round.\" McEvoy, his Walker Cup mentor, is without doubt. \"Nick's a good-looking young guy, making a lot of money, travelling the world, falling for girls. It's inevitable he's not quite as focused as the others. He's younger than them. But nothing will hold him back in the long run. He'll work it out. He'll get to the top all right.\" If Dougherty, according to McEvoy, has the most natural ability, \"Casey has the physical attributes and Donald the mental strength. Rose is the all-rounder of the group. He gave himself unnecessary grief by turning pro after the 1998 Open. What he then went through - missing cut after cut after cut - would have killed most ordinary players. I said two years ago that Rose would have a better career than Sergio Garcia. I was ridiculed then but it doesn't look such a stupid comment now.\" When pushed, however, to pick the European player most likely to challenge Tiger Woods in the coming years, McEvoy chooses Donald. \"We haven't seen the best of Luke Donald by a long shot. He's a thoughtful and artistic guy. On the course, he's relentlessly determined and organised. He looks unbreakable. I can see him winning the Open one day. I can picture him winning more than one major. I can already see his face splashed all over magazine covers. He can go all the way.\" When Donald called last week, I was lurking near the fringes of the 10th tee at Loch Lomond, wondering how Dougherty, his former team-mate, might save himself. Even on the phone, driving home to Beaconsfield, Donald was sympathetic. \"It's a horrible situation for any golfer,\" he said. \"Nick's got the talent but it's a mental battle now. I missed three successive cuts in America earlier this year but there wasn't the same kind of pressure on me. I had done well in some of the early tournaments and had just finished seventh in the Buick Invitational. So I had plenty of points and cash in the bank. I knew I had a long year ahead of me. My game quickly came back and I'm going into the Open feeling strong. The golf's good and, mentally, I'm more than ready.\" Beyond Loch Lomond, and the banter of Casey, Poulter, Rose and Dougherty, Donald emerges as deeply serious and ambitious. \"I sometimes feel I haven't quite got the recognition back home that I deserve,\" he says of his extraordinary win last year in his first season on the US tour. \"But I'm playing on the other side of the world and attention has naturally swung to Rose, Casey and Poulter. They're all good players - like Nick Dougherty. I still feel a bond with all of them. And I'm glad that, together, we're breaking the old mould of the English golfer. \"But golf is a lonely game. I chose a different route. I'm playing in America because I want to become the best player in the world. It's as simple as that. The others have the same aim. But it's easy to talk about it. We now need to test ourselves in the majors - starting with the Open. It's a big deal. We all know it. We'll soon find out which of us can cut it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
