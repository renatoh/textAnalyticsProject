Thomas Zehetmair directs the concerto from the violin; he brings the work alive marvellously, pirouetting his way through the central pair of arias like an operatic diva, and dispatching the outer movements with tremendous \u00e9lan. But it's his work as a conductor on the two symphonies that is the real fascination here. It sounds as though he is using a relatively small body of strings in both works, and while it's hard to imagine using such forces in almost any other Sibelius symphony, it works extraordinarily well here. The Sixth benefits enormously from the extra transparency he can conjure from the smaller band. Even if they don't quite match the finest performances with more substantial forces, these accounts offer valuable and sometimes revealing alternatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
