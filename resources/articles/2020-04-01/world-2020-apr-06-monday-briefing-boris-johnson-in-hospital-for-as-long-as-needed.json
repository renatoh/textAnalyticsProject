This is Martin Farrer bringing you the top stories this Monday morning. Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital and will stay for treatment \u201cas long as needed\u201d after failing to shake off the coronavirus. The prime minister was diagnosed with the disease 10 days ago and had been continuing to coordinate the government\u2019s response to the crisis while self-isolating in Downing Street. But No 10 said on Sunday night that Johnson had been taken to an NHS hospital in London after days of persistent symptoms, including a fever. Stressing that he was undergoing tests as a \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure, No 10 said he would remain in charge of the government. However, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is expected to stand in for the prime minister while he is in hospital and will chair the government\u2019s coronavirus meeting this morning. Our health editor writes that the hospitalisation suggests the PM\u2019s case may have progressed to the risky second stage where the immune system can overreact to the virus and attack the body\u2019s own organs. The Queen urged Britons to \u201cremain strong\u201d in her address to the nation last night. Speaking from Windsor Castle, she invoked Dame Vera Lynn\u2019s wartime hit \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d and urged people to take comfort in the fact that \u201cwe will meet again\u201d. Scientists in the UK have warned that the testing kits ordered by the government and described by Johnson as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d could be unreliable and might only detect 50-60% of milder cases. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, has stood down from her role after it emerged that she had twice broken her own lockdown rules to visit her second home in Fife. In a sign of hope in the struggle against the virus, the European nations most badly affected \u2013 Italy, France and Spain \u2013 all reported a fall in deaths from the disease. In the US, the surgeon general warned that the country faces its \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d moment as the coming week shapes up to be the worst yet for fatalities. Donald Trump also admitted it would be difficult and announced he had ordered 29m hydroxychloroquine pills to help treat the disease. The global death toll from Covid-19 has risen to almost 70,000 and there are now close to 1,275,000 cases. Here is our latest at-a-glance summary and we will have all the developments throughout the day on our coronavirus live blog.

She says in the Instagram post that she eventually fled but can\u2019t remember how she got home. After spending the last 10 years \u201ccompletely alone\u201d, she wrote that she was \u201cno longer ashamed that something deeply hurt me\u201d. * * * Housing dip \u2013 House sales will collapse this year because of the coronavirus crisis but prices will only fall 3%, according to a study by Knight Frank. It says sales in the UK will plummet from 1,175,000 last year to 734,000 this year, spelling disaster for agents and other firms in the property chain that rely on transactions for their business. But it predicted prices would rebound next year by 5% to leave the market in the black despite the Covid-19 shock. Coronavirus Extra The United Nations\u2019 biodiversity chief has called for a global ban on wildlife markets of the type in Wuhan believed to be the starting point of the coronavirus outbreak.
