Wilshere suffered a kick on the joint during the 2-2 draw with Switzerland at Wembley in June, a knock sustained after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, had suggested the 19-year-old was \"in the red\" in his breakthrough season at senior level, meaning he faced serious injury if he did not rest. The midfielder was withdrawn from the England Under-21 squad for the summer's European Championship, only to struggle in pre-season and limped out of the Emirates Cup tie against New York Red Bulls with a recurrence of the problem. He is not expected back until November at the earliest, and is now wearing a protective boot. Yet Capello was quick to absolve England of any responsibility, claiming the player had been troubled by the hot spot on the bone, as diagnosed by Arsenal's club doctors, from 2009, since when he has featured heavily on loan at Bolton Wanderers and for Arsenal. \"I spoke with the doctor,\" Capello said. \"I know that he suffered the same two years ago. Then he suffered this accident against Switzerland, it's true, and afterwards he went on holiday. When he started the new season, he was not fit. Now they've found the problem.\" Asked whether he was surprised that Wilshere had been allowed to depart on holiday rather than begin rehabilitation or preventative work immediately after suffering the kick against the Swiss, Capello said: \"I don't know. It's not my job to say what happened, but he suffered against Switzerland and then went on holiday for a month. \"But look, I want to explain: when I selected him, he was fit. Things can happen during the game. That's normal. People get shoulder, knee, head injuries \u2026 If you play, that's possible, and people can be injured in tackles. It happened. But when he started that game he was fit. If he hadn't been fit, he wouldn't have played. That's the big difference. Now I hope he will be fit in a really short time for Arsenal and for us because, for the future, he's a really important player for us both.\" Wilshere, who gained his fifth cap against Switzerland having made 49 appearances for Arsenal last season, will miss the end of England's Euro 2012 qualification campaign and a significant number of his club's Premier League and Champions League group games. Wenger has said that, while the player was on holiday, the joint was \"all right and then his pain increased when Arsenal were on tour in Asia\" in pre-season. The injury is to be assessed in two months' time. The protective boot is due to be removed in mid-October and, if the problem is not cured by rest, there is the possibility of inserting a screw into the joint, ruling him out into December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
