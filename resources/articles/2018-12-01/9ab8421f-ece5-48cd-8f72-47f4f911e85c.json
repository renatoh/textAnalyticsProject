It is believed to be the first time the honour has been presented to anyone for their contribution to magic. Berglas began his career in the 1950s, becoming a household name with his regular performances on radio and television. He was renowned for creating large stunts, among them driving a car around London in a blindfold, and hurtling blindfolded down the Cresta Run. His version of the Any Card at Any Number routine is known as the Berglas Effect, with magicians considering it the holy grail of card magic. Berglas said: \u201cI am delighted to accept this honour \u2013 but even more pleased that the art of magic has at last been recognised. I have spent over 60 years entertaining people in person, on radio and television \u2013 \u2018reading their minds\u2019 \u2013 but I certainly didn\u2019t see this one coming\u201d. Paying tribute to Berglas, who has received a host of international awards, the TV illusionist Derren Brown said: \u201cThis honour recognises one of our greatest living magical performers. Generations of magicians owe him a debt of gratitude. Each of my shows is indebted to his artistry and astonishing body of work.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
