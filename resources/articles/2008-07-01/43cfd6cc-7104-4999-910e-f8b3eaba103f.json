In the middle of all that special charm, however, as suddenly and as apocalyptically as the announcement of a positive dope test, came the news of Sky television's pledge of a multimillion-dollar investment in the activities of British Cycling. Rupert Murdoch's satellite channel, which built its initial success on its appeal to football fans, plans to sponsor the body that supervises all forms of unmotorised two-wheel competition in the United Kingdom, and which is behind the recently astonishing success of our track cyclists. White Van Man Embraces Lycra Lout? That would be the cynical subeditor's headline on the story. On the face of it, a splurge on bike racing by the proprietor of the Sun represents a collision between two natural enemies. Murdoch, after all, also pays a fair part of the salary of the patron saint of road rage. Jeremy Clarkson, White Ferrari Man himself, would fit machine guns between his headlights and use them to exterminate cyclists if only the law of the land allowed it. Which just goes to show, I suppose, how significant the explosion of popular interest in cycling must be. Even the Dirty Digger, who probably wouldn't know the Alpe d'Huez from a hole in the ground, can't resist the opportunity to make some money from it. Or maybe, looking at David Cameron, he's decided that cycling is part of the coming New Tory world, and wants to get on board. Perhaps it will turn out to be a marriage made in heaven, and Sky's millions will enable Dave Brailsford, British Cycling's performance director, to realise his dream of entering a national team in the Tour de France, featuring riders from his development programme: the likes of Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas and, of course, Mark Cavendish, the new poster boy. On the face of it, the satellite channel's intention to get involved at every level of competitive and leisure cycling, and to build participation programmes for people of all ages and abilities, ought to do nothing but good. But one of cycling's great qualities is its simplicity, almost - don't scoff - its innocence. Here, for instance, are the words of the 23-year-old Cavendish after the second of his four stage wins in the Tour. \"I used to work in a bank when I was younger,\" he said, \"and to me it doesn't matter whether it's raining or the sun is shining or whatever. As long as I'm riding a bike I know I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\" That reminded me of something I'd read in this paper a few days earlier, a remark by the 87-year-old Tommy Godwin, a double bronze medal winner in the 1,000m time trial and the team pursuit in the 1948 Olympics in London. \"Riding a bike is everything to a cyclist,\" Godwin said. \"The friendship and camaraderie you have with other cyclists ... to a cyclist, it was the be-all and end-all of your life.\" Murdoch's people will bring exciting innovations to television's treatment of bike racing; they may give Brailsford the resources with which to launch Britain's racing cyclists to even greater levels of achievement. But they had better not let all their money and the conflicts of interest it will inevitably generate do anything to damage the simple pleasure that unites the man who rode for Britain 60 years ago and the young hero who is currently preparing for his next challenge in Beijing. When you're lucky enough to drive a stage of the Tour de France in front of the riders, you find yourself welcomed into a world of endless smiles, bestowed by spectators young and old on anybody associated with the race. Cycling has survived amphetamines, pot belge, steroids, EPO and human growth hormone, and kept that innocence. Let's hope it can survive an injection of Murdoch. Don't put your money on Mosley walking away from life in the fast lane There was no surprise in this quarter when Max Mosley won his case in the high court. As any of his enemies in formula one would tell you, Max rarely fights battles he can't win. So now Mosley is suing the News of the World for libel. If he wins again, it would be as well to expect an announcement, perhaps in the early summer of next year, that he will not, after all, be sticking to his decision to step down at the end of his current term in October 2009. His work, he will say, is not done and he is the only man qualified to accomplish it. Therefore he will offer himself for re-election, fortified by his crushing victory in a vote of confidence among the FIA's general council a few weeks ago. Mark my words: Max and his pal Bernie Ecclestone will be running formula one long after the rest of us have gone to the great paddock in the sky. Who will take responsibility for our cricket failings? If there is a phrase, other than \"with the greatest respect\", that more effectively undermines whatever words are about to follow, it must be the one spoken by Geoff Miller the other day. \"Anyone who knows me well ...\" he began, trying to explain the selection of Darren Pattinson for the second Test. Why on earth should we be required to know him well in order to judge the effectiveness of his decisions? They must speak for themselves. Miller is the squad's \"national selector\". Another former player, Hugh Morris, has the title of \"managing director\". Oh, for a system where one bloke gets on with the job and carries the can. No matter how you say it, the numbers don't add up Rather belatedly, given that it is three years since London was granted the 2012 Olympics, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has asked Sport England to \"develop and deliver a new strategy to create the infrastructure necessary to support increased participation\". When that kind of bureaucratic gobbledygook is applied to the simple pleasures of running, jumping and throwing, you have a good idea of the potential outcome. And might the failure of the DCMS to find funding from private industry for its vaunted 2012 training fund, as reported on this site last week, have less to do with the credit crunch than with the lack of belief created in businessmen by Tessa Jowell's almost criminal mis-management of the Olympic budget, exemplified by the omission of around \u00a31bn in VAT? Baggies fans left to thank sponsors for small mercies Although West Bromwich Albion currently lack a shirt sponsor, fans who invest in this season's new kit are being told that the appropriate logo will be printed on their shirts \"free of charge\" as soon as the relevant backer has been secured. Free of charge? Such generosity! Those who sell the logo-spattered products that we walk around in must be laughing themselves stupid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
