Eight members of the nine-strong bench overturned a lower court ruling against trooper Chadrin Mullenix and found he was entitled to immunity from lawsuits. Legal experts say the ruling will probably make it harder to sue police in the future for using deadly force. Mullenix was sued by the family of Israel Leija after he fired into Leija\u2019s fleeing car despite having been told by a superior to wait for the vehicle to reach a series of tire spikes that had been set up nearby. Leija, a 24-year-old from the rural town of Tulia, had sped off after being issued with a warrant for breaking the terms of his probation, but had threatened police that he would shoot if they did not call off an 18-minute car chase that reached speeds of up to 110mph. \u201cHow\u2019s that for proactive?\u201d said Mullenix, after allegedly ignoring a request to wait and see if the spikes worked before attempting the unusual manouevre of stopping the speeding car by firing at it with his rifle from an overpass. Earlier, the trooper had been told in a counseling session that he was not enterprising enough. \u201cThe comment seems to me revealing of the culture this court\u2019s decision supports when it calls it reasonable \u2013 or even reasonably reasonable \u2013 to use deadly force for no discernible gain and over a supervisor\u2019s express order to \u2018stand by\u2019,\u201d wrote Sotomayor in her dissent. \u201cBy sanctioning a \u2018shoot first, think later\u2019 approach to policing, the court renders the protections of the fourth amendment hollow,\u201d she added. Sotomayor argued instead that \u201cany reasonable officer could not have thought that shooting would stop the car with less danger or greater certainty than waiting\u201d, suggesting he should have waited to see if the tire spikes worked first. Earlier, the fifth circuit court of appeals had agreed that Mullenix violated the rule that a police officer may not \u201cuse deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others\u201d. But the majority of the supreme court reversed the appellate court decision in a ruling published on Monday, arguing that although no gun had ever been found, Leija\u2019s threat to use one meant the trooper was justified in believing there was a danger. \u201cIn this case, Mullenix confronted a reportedly intoxicated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice during his flight had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhen Mullenix fired, he reasonably understood Leija to be a fugitive fleeing arrest, at speeds over 100 miles per hour, who was armed and possibly intoxicated, who had threatened to kill any officer he saw if the police did not abandon their pursuit, and who was racing towards Officer Ducheneaux\u2019s position.\u201d Antonin Scalia, viewed as the most conservative member of the bench, went further and wrote a separate judgement concurring with the majority and arguing that because the officer said he was trying to stop the car rather than kill its driver, it was wrong to treat it as a question of justifiable killing. \u201cTrooper Mullenix did not shoot to wound or kill the fleeing Leija, nor even to drive Leija\u2019s car off the road, but only to cause the car to stop by destroying its engine,\u201d wrote Scalia. \u201cIt distorts that inquiry, I think, to make the question whether it was reasonable for Mullenix to \u2018apply deadly force\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
