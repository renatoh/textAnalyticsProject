Or is it the other way round? Either way, it was a pretty good day for the club at the top of the Premiership and, since he scored 18 points, a rewarding one for Toby Flood in his quest to take his country's No10 shirt off Jonny Wilkinson. There was a proviso to the performance by Flood, in that he spent only the first half in the position up for grabs, and in that time was a mixture of good and indifferent. He took the ball at pace into the face of the Gloucester defensive line a couple of times, but scuffed a restart. With the departure of Dan Hipkiss, Flood moved to inside centre, which meant that the two outside halves were now Nicky Robinson, a Welshman, and Jeremy Staunton, an Irishman. It is a feature of English club rugby that nobody is really little England at all. In the centre, Flood took his place in a leaky defence that allowed Jonny May in particular to spring into action. Gloucester, as the game opened up loosely, began to look more imaginative than Leicester, which admittedly is not always so very hard to do. It did not matter, since up front Leicetser were giving their visitors a right old going over. At the scrum Gloucester had a gruesome afternoon, suffering against Martin Castrogiovanni, Mefyn Davies and Marcos Ayerza. Again, not an Englishman in sight. In the line-out, however, Louis Deacon, Geoff Parling and Jordan Crane, English to their core, had a field day. In short, the Leicester pack hogged possession and the team smashed their way forward, with Geordan Murphy adding a little cameo of artistry to keep the more sensitive supporters satisfied. The Irish full-back scored the try straight after the break that put the game to bed. Flood was involved in the passing movement across the field, as was Scott Hamilton who did not have the safest day with his hands. To release the full back must have been a relief for the New Zealander. Lote Tuqiri, who is going back to Australia after landing himself in one the coldest winters since, as they say, records began, scored a strange try after Crane had fumbled at the base of a scrum. Sometimes the front five can blast the set-piece forwards a bit too fast for a No8's liking. Tuqiri ran through a large gap produced by the interruption to the smooth advance. Crane, for the rest of the game, had a big part to play and was more influential than Gareth Delve who has been promoted of late for a return to the Welsh squad. It was a day in retreat for the Gloucester captain, not for advancing his international credentials. The final try by the home team was scored by Ben Youngs who is not without international ambitions of his own. The scrum-half made several clean breaks, but none led to anything, suggesting that excitement may get the better of him at the moment to decide what to do next. Until, that is, he chose to score. Youngs is a fine, raw talent. On the losing side, Olly Morgan looked full of sparkle at full-back. Gloucester were full of adventure but without any ball. In that respect they could not be accused of being any sort of England. But since they were the losers, it may not matter as the big team prepare to face Ireland at Twickenham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
