All over Havana \u2014 from the faded stone grandeur of the old city to the dilapidated concrete of the suburbs \u2014 the opinions that come easiest to the surface are deep respect for the revolution Castro led in 1959, gratitude for the more equal system he then established, and admiration for his ability to ensure its survival in a hostile world. But amid the pride and the defiance of \"those in other countries who wanted us to fail\", there are many voicing hopes that things will now be different. \"The fundamental problem, and I really mean fundamental, is economic,\" says Gomez, a university professor who, like most Cubans, prefers to give only his first name. \"The political and the social problems were largely resolved but \u2026 right now in Cuba people are not living very well.\" Gomez's dream, he says, is to set up his own consultancy advising new businesses on how to take on the US embargo and win. There are 1m people with a university education on the island, he says, the product of the revolution \u2014 but also stunted by it. \"The system has to start to trust us and let us do things like that,\" he says. \"I don't need much money, give me a computer in a corner and I bet I can contribute to the development of this country.\" The old Cuba still oozes from every corner. Crumbling colonial architecture is much more prevalent than the renovated splendour; American gas guzzlers from the 1950s and motorcycles with side cars still trundle through the streets despite the odd shiny taxi. On corners at night, bands strike up and locals start dancing. Uniformed children sing the national anthem in public squares before the school day begins. In the poor barrio of Marianao \u2014 a transport hub for people travelling to the provinces squeezed on benches in covered trucks \u2014 Babi and her daughter Olga amble home. \"I am proud to live here and proud of everything the revolution has done. I only wish that the comandante en jefe [Castro] was immortal and that he could be our leader forever,\" says the elder of the women. \"But that there are things that don't work and things I would like to see different \u2014 of course there are.\" Chief among these, for her, are greater freedoms to live and work in different parts of the country, which are restricted to avoid internal migration resulting from existing uneven national development. The women come from Guant\u00e1namo, at the opposite end of this elongated island to Havana, and say they are constantly in fear of being picked up by police and deported back to where they come from. \"How dare they do that to people like us,\" says Olga. \"We are just as Cuban as anybody who lives here.\" The women would also like to have more freedom to associate with foreigners in the capital's centre. The growth of tourism in the past 15 years has been accompanied by a corresponding growth in prostitutes in search of the special currency they use. This is largely tolerated by the government, but Olga says she knows of cases of women being beaten by police just for talking to a foreign man. Tourism has brought with it new pressures. Beyond the prostitution, there is also an acute sense among some of deprivation. Ariel sits on the kerb of his aunt's house in L'Habana Vieja. \"I don't see why we can't also travel to other countries and then come home again like the tourists who come here,\" he says. Sitting on a bench watching the world go by, 78-year-old Alfonso sees foreigners eating in restaurants he frequented as a young man but now he can only dream of on his 230 peso monthly pension [about $10] and ration book. \"They are all the same,\" he says of the country's leaders in general, including Castro's younger brother Ra\u00fal who has been heading the government since Fidel withdrew with intestinal problems 19 months ago. \"Well perhaps not quite the same. None of them, perhaps nobody, has the extraordinary power to convince and the trick the people as Fidel.\" Whatever their opinion of the leader there does seem to be consensus that his exit was certainly well executed. On Radio Ciudad de Habana's morning news show the day after the resignation, an analyst summed up coverage of Castro's resignation around the world. \"Even the US press had to admit, that Fidel saw off 10 presidents,\" he said. \"Fidel is going when he chose and this is another victory against the empire because they know, even the mafia in Miami knows, that in Cuba there is tranquillity, order, and understanding of what is happening with the revolution and the fact that it is going to continue.\" \"It was elegant,\" says Viven of Castro's departure. \"He went because of ill health, and that is a motive of pride for us because he wasn't pushed out by the Americans. He went when he wanted to. But he will always be here guiding us where to go next.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
