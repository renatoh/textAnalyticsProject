The council of the American Library Association (ALA) passed a resolution this week to rename its top professional award, the Melvil Dewey Medal. The resolution explains that Dewey did not permit Jewish people, African Americans or other minorities admittance to the resort he owned, the Lake Placid Club. He also \u201cmade numerous inappropriate physical advances toward women he worked with and wielded professional power over\u201d and was ostracised from the ALA after four women accused him of sexual impropriety, the resolution continues, declaring that \u201cthe behaviour demonstrated for decades by Dewey does not represent the stated fundamental values of ALA in equity, diversity, and inclusion\u201d. Dewey was one of the founders of the ALA. In 1876, he published A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library, which outlined what would become known as the Dewey decimal classification \u2013 a system which is now used by libraries throughout the English-speaking world. He was director of the New York State Library from 1889 to 1906, when pressure from petitioners outraged at the exclusion of Jews from his resort forced his resignation. In Dewey\u2019s biography, Irrepressible Reformer, Wayne Wiegand recounts how Los Angeles Public Library head librarian Tessa Kelso wrote in a 1924 letter that \u201cfor many years women librarians have been the special prey of Mr Dewey in a series of outrages against decency\u201d. Writing in the ALA\u2019s magazine American Libraries last June, editor-at-large Anne Ford described how early biographies of the librarian called him a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201ca prophet pointing forward to a glorious promised land\u201d. His history of harassment was brushed off with the excuse that his \u201cconsciousness of his own strength and freedom from evil purpose led to a serene indifference in his every-day public relations with women\u201d, and his exclusion of Jews from his resort with the reasoning that \u201cDewey might \u2013 and did \u2013 point out that as a private club, it had a perfect legal right to do this\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until Wiegand\u2019s 1996 biography that the full extent of Dewey\u2019s behaviour was made clear. \u201cTo be clear, no one we spoke with is calling for Dewey to be wiped from the history books,\u201d Ford continued. \u201cNor are they suggesting that his accomplishments be disregarded. Still, more than 20 years after Dewey\u2019s misconduct was laid bare in Irrepressible Reformer, public acknowledgments of his racism and sexism remain rare.\u201d Ian Anstice, the editor of Public Libraries News, acknowledged that the revelations about Dewey\u2019s behaviour cause librarians \u201csome difficulties\u201d, because while the system he devised has been modified it is still widely used. \u201cIt would be difficult to scrap it and odd to change its name,\u201d Anstice said, \u201cbut such things as simply renaming an award absolutely should be done. Dewey is in the past now and should not be someone that is unquestionably looked up to. His behaviour should be questioned and responded to appropriately, like we would with anyone else.\u201d The ALA has yet to decide on a new name for the Dewey Medal. The move follows the American Library Association\u2019s decision last year to change the name of its Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal to the Children\u2019s literature legacy award following concerns raised over the Little House on the Prairie author\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d legacy, in particular her \u201cstereotypical\u201d portrayal of African Americans and Native Americans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
