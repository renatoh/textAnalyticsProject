In the 304-page document, Nasdaq reveals that it has scaled back its ambitions to own 90% of the shares and is now aiming to take control by winning just over 50% of the shareholders. As it already owns a little over 28%, the US exchange needs to convince holders of 21.3% of the remaining shares to back its offer. With the 60-day takeover clock ticking, the fate of the LSE could be decided by February 10 if no other bidders emerge. Nasdaq, which is bidding \u00a312.43 a share, will take its offer directly to the London exchange's investors after being rebuffed by its management. LSE's shares were at \u00a313.20 yesterday, unchanged on the day. The publication of the offer document failed to lure Clara Furse, the LSE chief executive, to the negotiating table. \"The board unanimously rejects Nasdaq's offer as it substantially undervalues the exchange and fails to reflect its unique strategic position and the powerful earnings and operational momentum of the business,\" the LSE said. Under the Takeover Panel's rules, the LSE has until Boxing Day - 14 days from when the offer document is posted - to make its formal response to the offer. The shares continue to change hands at a price higher than the official bid, which appears to suggest that investors believe a higher offer will emerge. However, City sources pointed out the higher share price could also be the result of complex trading strategies implemented by the hedge funds that own at least 30% of the shares. Nasdaq has said its offer is \"final\", which means it can hike the price only if another bidder emerges or if Ms Furse agrees to open discussions. But the decision by the US market to lower the threshold of acceptances may help its chances. \"The offer is not the kind that blows people away but the hurdle is not very high,\" said Edward Ditmire, analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it went through.\" Nasdaq's chief executive Robert Greifeld stressed the competitive threats London faced in an attempt to justify not raising the bid. Among the challenges facing the LSE is the prospect of a rival trading platform, dubbed Project Turquoise, created by a group of investment banks. The bid by Nasdaq comes almost two years to the day that Deutsche B\u00f6rse kick-started the current round of bids when it offered 530p a share. The shares have since raced higher and LSE has seen off approaches by the French-Dutch combine Euronext and the Australian bank Macquarie. The City is waiting to see if the LSE can find a white knight to fend off Nasdaq after its summer attempts to link with the money broker Icap came to nothing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
