Gloucester may be at the top of the Zurich Premiership and in next month's Powergen Cup final but they are cutting costs in order to be in a position to balance their books next season. Neither do they want to rely on their benefactor of the past four years, Tom Walkinshaw, whose businesses have been struggling financially. \"We are releasing five of our 15-strong support staff for two reasons,\" said the managing director Ken Nottage. \"A salary cap is being introduced for coaches next season, and we have had a shortfall in income from central funds. \"It is not a picture of doom and gloom at Kingsholm. It is essential in the current economic climate that clubs do not spend money they have not got. Everyone in the Premiership is feeling the squeeze.\" Gloucester's players have yet to respond to Walkinshaw's request that they take pay cuts for the rest of the season. The club's commercial department accepted pay cuts of up to 20% earlier this year. \"We have to make do with less staff,\" said Melville. \"The whole philosophy of the way Gloucester is run is changing massively. \"The problem with a decision like this is the unsuitable timing. There are problems at the club that must be solved but we must not put anything at risk or hurt ourselves.\" In Wales, the leading clubs will meet today to consider a take-it-or-leave-it offer from the Welsh Rugby Union chief executive David Moffett over the five regional teams he wants to see set up next season. The clubs have demanded an annual budget of \u00a38.1m but Moffett insists he is prepared to put up only \u00a37.5m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
