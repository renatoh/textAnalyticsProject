UK broadcaster income was \u00a313.2bn in 2014, up 3.1% compared to \u00a312.8bn in 2013, according to Ofcom\u2019s latest Communications Market Report. BBC income spent on TV was up 5% to \u00a32.7bn, accounting for more than a fifth of the total. Ofcom said the increased figure attributed to the BBC was primarily down to its coverage of the World Cup in Brazil and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. However, the BBC\u2019s contribution to total broadcaster income has grown slower than most other sources over the last five years, up only 1.3% from 2009 and down as a proportion of the total from 23% to 20.1%. Advertising revenue increased 3.9% to \u00a33.8bn, with broadcasters increasing their total share of display advertising \u2013 which includes print ads and online banners \u2013 slightly to 44%. The core channels of the public service broadcasters including ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 attracted \u00a32.1bn in advertising, well over half the total. However, subscription revenue for paid services such as Sky, Virgin and BT remained the largest source of income for broadcasters, accounting for almost \u00a36bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
