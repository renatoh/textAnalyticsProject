Hull had surged back from 24-10 behind to pull level with three tries in seven minutes, two of them to their Maori centre Toa Kohe-Love to complete his hat-trick. But their wing Matt Crowther missed two chances to win the game, first by failing to convert Kohe-Love's third try from near the touchline in the 75th minute, then by ignoring several supporting players when he made a break minutes later. Withers punished him with only the second drop goal of his career, a superb strike from more than 30 metres to keep the Bulls two points clear of St Helens and inflict Hull's fifth defeat in seven matches. \"We'd dug ourselves into a hole,\" admitted Withers, the Australian who was selected in the Great Britain squad for last autumn's Ashes series on the back of his Irish ancestry but ignored for the three matches, and again for last week's record defeat in Sydney. Brian Noble, the Bradford coach who suffered as David Waite's assistant in Australia last Friday, said: \"It's fantastic to come up with a win on the last play like that. For 65 minutes we were great, but in the end it was a great test of our character.\" Stuart Fielden, one of two Great Britain players defying jet lag to give their all for the Bulls, scored their only second-half try from close range, relishing the contrast between Hull's flimsy defence and the formidable Australian tackling he was facing seven days ago. But it was Paul Deacon, the young Bradford scrum-half who was overlooked by the Britain selectors, who played the leading role in establishing the Bulls' big lead with six goals from seven attempts. His accurate boot also laid on the first try of the match for another Bull who was disappointed to be left out of the Sydney Test, Leon Pryce. Hull were clearly second best. The exception was Kohe-Love, who took his tally of Super League tries since his winter move from Warrington to 12. The first was a superbly angled run on to Richard Horne's pass and inside Lee Gilmour, but he was otherwise kept quiet until Hull's former Bradford centre Graham Mackay sent Crowther sprinting around Withers to raise the first thoughts of a comeback. Kohe-Love then crossed twice in quick succession on the right, but Crowther's kicking was not up to the task and Withers put the boot in. \u00b7 St Helens celebrated the news that their coach Ian Millward has extended his contract by three years until the end of 2006 by coming from behind to beat London 22-14 at Knowsley Road. Millward, who turned down an offer to join Sydney's Wests Tigers, described the performance as \"rusty\" but praised Sean Long, who laid on a crucial try for Martin Gleeson in his first appearance since the Challenge Cup final in April.
