This unconvincing victory, courtesy of two Marlon Harewood goals, flattered the home side. Michael Carrick's departure - the third player to swap Upton Park for White Hart Lane in the past 12 months - appeared almost as inevitable as the outcome here. But Southend, who are next to bottom of the Football League's bottom division, frequently troubled their opponents with an inspired second-half performance. It was a measure of Southend's dominance that Pardew gave credit to his goalkeeper afterwards. \"I thought [James] Walker in goal on his debut showed that he deserved his chance earlier than he's got a chance at West Ham,\" said Pardew. West Ham's makeshift side, featuring three debutants, struggled to contain the threat of a Southend attack that has scored only once in five games. There was no indication of the problems to come when West Ham took the lead on 11 minutes. Nigel Reo-Coker was the architect, running from deep inside his own half before feeding a deft pass into the path of Harewood, who drove low past Bart Griemink for his first goal of the season. West Ham, however, were guilty of profligacy, most notably Harewood, who squandered several clear openings. His misses could have proved costly but Southend, who approached the second half with renewed purpose, failed to capitalise on their dominance. Mark Bentley's well-struck shot from 12 yards appeared goal-bound before Ward intervened to deflect the ball behind for a corner. The same player was unlucky again with 13 minutes remaining when he pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard box only to be denied by a deflection that diverted his shot into the side netting. Between those chances Southend were denied a penalty when Trent McClenahan appeared to have handled, and it was not until the first minute of injury-time that West Ham secured their place in the second round when Harewood escaped to drill in an undeserved second. \"I thought it was a good performance and I'm disappointed that we came away losing 2-0,\" said Southend's manager Steve Tilson. \"It was a bit harsh.\" Plenty of home supporters were in agreement.
