Within months that solitary event had mushroomed into a cluster of get-togethers across Britain and further afield, where unbelievers met to celebrate life without God. Now, 16 months after the first Sunday Assembly, the organisation predicts it will have 100 congregations on five continents by the end of 2014, and this weekend it will hold its first \"general assembly\" to set up a system of church-like management, an event that the group's organisers acknowledge will be compared to the Church of England's General Synod. \"Sunday Assemblies have been kicking off in places we never thought possible,\" said Sanderson Jones, the comedian who along with musician and actor Pippa Evans dreamed up the project in January last year. \"If I open my email box the first email is in Hungarian, discussing Sunday Assembly Budapest, after there is something from Kenya, then the Western Cape, then Richmond, Virginia, then Cincinnati, then Boston.\" Congregations are also starting in S\u00e3o Paulo, Kuala Lumpur, Grimsby and Aberdeen. Jones said he could not be more excited about helping non-believers around the globe set up their own communities as part of his organisation's bold, evangelical ambition to see a godless congregation in every town, city and village that wants one. The general assembly will be held in London on Saturday, featuring workshops and lectures for delegates from the UK, US and Netherlands on how to set up their own non-religious congregation. In addition, they will elect members to the organisation's board, debate how it should be governed and, critically, agree on the limits of the new non-church's doctrine. \"We are growing fast but we want to ensure that it is good growth,\" said Jones of the move to formalise the structure. \"The reason we want to have an overarching organisation is we have a mission to help everyone live as fully as possible, and if you look at the organisations that do things most efficiently, they tend to have a structure to them.\" But if the group is to set limits on its own doctrines, doesn't that introduce the question of how it deals with non-religious heresy? \"If people want to do things differently we say, good on you,\" said Jones. In fact, the Sunday Assembly experienced its first schism last year \u2013 a rite of passage for any fledgling church \u2013 when members of the Sunday Assembly outpost in New York decided to go it alone following a dispute over different definitions of atheism. Rather than heresy, Jones says, splits should be seen as \"awesome product development\". Despite the obvious potential for such cultural differences in a now global church, however \u2013 and the fact that at least 27 new Sunday Assemblies are preparing to open in the US alone \u2014 there are no plans for regional management structures at present, says Jones. He will act as chief executive \u2013 and not archbishop, he insists \u2013 of what remains for now a limited company, though it has applied for charitable status."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
