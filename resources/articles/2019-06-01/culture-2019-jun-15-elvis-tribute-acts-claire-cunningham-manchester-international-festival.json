The whole town is taken over by everyone having a go. It\u2019s extraordinary and it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Cunningham found herself in the middle of Europe\u2019s largest Elvis festival in the name of research for her latest show, Thank You Very Much, a dance-theatre piece that examines the idea of identity through the prism of the tribute artist. Cunningham had been fascinated by Elvis since she was a child listening to Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love on her mum\u2019s record player. As an adult, and an award-winning performer and choreographer, she came back to Elvis from a different angle. \u201cI became really fascinated by how he danced, how he moved,\u201d she says. Cunningham wanted to learn how to dance like Elvis, and rather than copying a video, she wanted to learn from an expert. And where better to get an education in Elvis\u2019s snake hips than in a town full of impersonators? Amid the wall-to-wall Love Me Tenders and Jailhouse Rocks in Porthcawl, Cunningham began to be fascinated by what makes a \u201cgood\u201d tribute act. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who just can\u2019t watch TV competition shows,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate things that compare one person with another. But as soon as I sat in that room I was already deciding why somebody was better than somebody else. That intrigued me.\u201d She found herself weighing up whether it was more important to look like The King, or sound like him, or whether being a good performer and showman (they were all men, incidentally) was more important than both of those things. From the guy who\u2019d just stuck on some comedy sideburns to the pro who\u2019d spent thousands on a rhinestone jumpsuit, they were all chasing this almost mythical Elvis-shaped ideal, and surprisingly that was something that chimed with Cunningham\u2019s own life. Having been born with osteoporosis, Cunningham, 42, has used crutches since she was a teenager and incorporates them into her often autobiographical work on stage. Being held up to a physical ideal is a familiar feeling for Cunningham. \u201c[There are] these parallels of people having ideas about who you are and how your body should be that require no investment in actually getting to know that person,\u201d she says. She realised the Elvis tribute was a way into talking about her own experience of identity and disability, and that of her fellow performers (Dan Daw, Tanja Erhart and Vicky Malin) trying to live up to society\u2019s idea of what a body should be, just like the Porthcawl impersonators were attempting to live up to \u201cthe elephant in the room that everybody is being compared to\u201d. Thank You Very Much is not \u2013 repeat not \u2013 an Elvis tribute show, even though it takes place in a social club, the natural home of the tribute act, and there will be singing, and most likely moves Cunningham learned from impersonators she met (including \u201950s legs, the \u201classo\u201d and the \u201cmachine gun\u201d). But this is no faithful rehash of the \u201968 Comeback Special. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to create that illusion,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about the parallel with this shared experience of \u2018who are we all trying to be like?\u2019\u201d Something else Cunningham realised from talking to the Porthcawl fans was just how revolutionary Presley had been when he arrived on the scene. \u201cFor somebody of my generation, it\u2019s hard to understand how shocking Elvis was when he first appeared, how provocative,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something I really related to, in the lived experience of disability \u2013 being seen as a disturbance to what is normal or acceptable,\u201d she says. \u201cI recognise that in the treatment of me and many of my friends who, when we arrive into spaces, are a spectacle. We might as well be walking around in 70s jumpsuits. You are performing all the time, every time you walk through a door, or wheel through a door,\u201d she says. \u201cOr for some people, every time they try to communicate, the way they speak becomes a spectacle, or a disturbance.\u201d These are serious, personal, meaty matters to deal with in dance and their treatment could be earnest or preachy. But Cunningham\u2019s route into the subject makes that unlikely. \u201cThese parallels are the things I\u2019m interested in playing with in the show,\u201d she says. \u201cBut being able to do it through this very fun lens, it\u2019s been such a beautiful thing to research.\u201d What Cunningham loved most about her visit to Porthcawl was the commitment of the fans and the tribute artists she met. \u201cThis desire to share the love of the thing they love \u2013 as an artist I really relate to that. That\u2019s often at the core of what I do, trying to share something or communicate with people.\u201d One thing she now wants to share is the idea of the \u201cself-tribute\u201d. In other words, how you let go of trying to be like somebody else and love who you are. \u201cIt sounds very cheesy,\u201d she says, \u201cbut how can we help each other get to a place where you can pay tribute to who you are right now? Where the way that you move is the ideal. The way that you talk.\u201d Where you might appreciate, as Elvis would say, the wonder of you? \u2022 Thank You Very Much is at the Ukrainian Cultural Centre, 31 Smedley Lane, Manchester M8 8XB, 17-20 July \u2022 The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
