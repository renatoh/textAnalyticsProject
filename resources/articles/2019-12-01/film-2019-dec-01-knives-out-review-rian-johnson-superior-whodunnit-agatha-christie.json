That\u2019s been a feature of Johnson\u2019s career since his low-budget debut feature, Brick (2005), transposed a dark, 1940s noir narrative to the sunny environs of a modern California high school, with attention-grabbing results. In 2012\u2019s Looper, he turned a time-travel adventure into a bleak meditation upon the consequences of solving problems through violence. More recently, his 2017 Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi, outraged some hardcore fans who didn\u2019t think the series\u2019 ever-evolving mythology should be up for discussion. In the deliciously entertaining Knives Out, Johnson goes back to his roots with an updated homage to the Agatha Christie whodunnits he loved as a child, and to those \u201ccheekily self-aware\u201d screen adaptations in which Peter Ustinov would lead an all-star cast through a labyrinthine murder mystery. The setting is a gothic pile in modern-day New England where crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) has recently capped his 85th birthday celebrations by dying dramatically in his attic study. It looks like an open-and-shut suicide, but could one of Harlan\u2019s variously leechy family members (witheringly described as a bunch of \u201cself-made over-achievers\u201d) have slit his throat? After all, the old man spent the evening settling old scores and \u201ccleaning house\u201d\u2026 Perhaps black-sheep Ransom (Chris Evans, oozing privilege) did it \u2013 he was heard arguing with his grandfather that night. Or what about the ever-so-slightly snivelling Walt (Michael Shannon, playing against type), whose publishing fortune depended on his father\u2019s faltering favour? Then there\u2019s son-in-law Richard (Don Johnson), a Trumpy horror with a wandering eye; and widowed lifestyle guru Joni (Toni Collette, channelling goopy Gwyneth Paltrow), both of whom had axes to grind. Only Harlan\u2019s nurse and carer Marta (Ana de Armas) appears above suspicion, blessed with a \u201cregurgitative reaction to mistruths\u201d that makes her vomit when lying. As for eldest daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis in career-best form), she can\u2019t help \u201cthinking about Dad\u2019s games\u201d and \u201cwaiting for the big reveal\u2026\u201d Helping to divine the nature of Harlan\u2019s \u201cmanner of death\u201d is gentleman sleuth Benoit Blanc, a cigar-smoking, coin-flipping interloper played with an outrageous southern US accent (Ransom calls him the \u201cCSI-KFC\u201d) by Daniel Craig. Blanc describes himself as a \u201cpassive observer of the truth\u201d, but a web of intrigue surrounds his own presence at this party. Who hired him? And what for? As with the very best whodunnits, everything is set up and sneakily signalled in the opening moments of the drama, but it\u2019s only on second viewing that those early clues become evident. There\u2019s real pleasure to be had watching Johnson wind the coiled springs of his steel-trap plot, yet none of it would bite if we didn\u2019t care about the characters, who remain just on the right side of caricature. Built upon a wittily verbose script that delivers more laugh-out-loud lines than most of the year\u2019s alleged comedies, Knives Out retains a beating human heart into which daggers are regularly plunged. Witness Linda delivering a stinging reminder that all this entertaining mystery is playing out in the wake of a family tragedy, with Curtis\u2019s imperious performance capturing that balance between the arch and the empathetic that is the film\u2019s signature. As with Christie\u2019s novels, there\u2019s a strong element of social satire too. Although Marta is repeatedly told that she\u2019s \u201cpart of the family\u201d, she wasn\u2019t invited to Harlan\u2019s funeral, prompting more than one wealthy suspect to insist confidentially: \u201cI thought you should have been there, but I was overruled.\u201d Significant, too, that the oft-mocked Blanc remains a fish out of water in this cloistered environment, presenting a clownish facade that distracts the unsuspecting from his more serious purpose. All this plays out in a house that is rightly likened to a giant Cluedo board (plaudits to production designer David Crank), replete with trick windows and creaky stairs, handily overheard by clock-watching light sleepers. Steve Yedlin\u2019s cameras prowl through its rooms with stealthy zest, slithering around characters, pushing in on their faces \u2013 eyeing them with close-up suspicion from below or maintaining a facade of objective distance from above. Editor Bob Ducsay intercuts between past and present as voiceovers establish a dynamic dialogue between disparate time periods. The cherry on the cake is Nathan Johnson\u2019s terrifically ripe score, as sharp and spiralling as the theatrical crown of knives that hangs behind key interrogation scenes, pointing and prodding accusingly as we wait for the sword of Damocles to drop."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
