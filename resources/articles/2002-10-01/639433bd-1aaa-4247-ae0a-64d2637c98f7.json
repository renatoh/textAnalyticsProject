Watching Pakistan is like going to Billy Smart's circus. A week ago in Colombo they staged a wonderful Shoaib Akhtar-inspired comeback to give Australia a serious fright. Yesterday, in the even fiercer heat of the Sharjah desert, they were all out for 59, their lowest ever Test score. By stumps Australia, who are already one up in the three-match series, were 132 runs ahead. Australia's tactics were refined, aggressive and ruthlessly executed but even Bangladesh would struggle to match Pakistan's display of ineptitude. The absence of three key batsmen - Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana - from this series was exposed. The three Australian seamers bowled to 8-1 off-side fields, often with no man behind square on the leg-side. The catching cordon began with three orthodox slips, then a fifth slip or short gully and was topped off with two more gullies. And unlike in Colombo, where Mark Waugh dropped three catches, the Australians' handling was impeccable. The pitch was more lively than one expects here and Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee both bowled faultlessly but this was jaw-dropping stuff. Pakistan's previous worst was 21 years ago also against Australia in Perth where Dennis Lillee, Terry Alderman and Jeff Thomson skittled them for 62. But that Pakistan batting line-up contained Mudassar Nazar, Javed Miandad and Imran Khan. Imran Nazir, Taufeeq Umar and Misbha-ul-Haq do not have the same ring. Abdul Razzaq, a biffing all-rounder, looks out of place at No3 in a Test. He was the only batsman to reach double figures but did not look remotely convincing. Having ground his way to 21 in two hours, he tried to cut a flipper from Shane Warne and hit the long-hop straight to Damien Martyn at cover. That was 46 for six. The new-look Warne, who says he has lost about two stones in six months, probably shed a few more pounds in conditions that he rated as hot as any he has experienced. During the lunch interval a pitch-side thermometer registered the temperature at 48C. His performance and figures were exemplary: 11-4-11-4. To a man, Pakistan adopted the tactic of playing for substantial turn from leg to off. Warne countered this with what he calls his slider, a delivery that looks like a regulation leg-break but turns only an inch or two. It accounted for Faisal Iqbal and Saqlain Mushtaq. The bad news for England is that Warne reckons he is bowling as well as ever with the rediscovery of his flipper - the back-spinner that scuttles through. There is good news for Nasser Hussain, though, with the continued poor form of the Waugh brothers. Just as Australia were moving towards a hundred lead, they were gone in two balls from Saqlain Mushtaq. Mark played back to a big off-break and was leg before. Steve was caught at silly point although replays did not reveal contact with his bat. This is Steve Waugh's 150th Test and only Allan Border has played more. It was the first time he had ever made two consecutive ducks in Test cricket - he made one in the second innings in Colombo - and he averages 21.56 in 16 innings since the end of the 2001 Ashes series. It was a flat end to an otherwise momentous day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
