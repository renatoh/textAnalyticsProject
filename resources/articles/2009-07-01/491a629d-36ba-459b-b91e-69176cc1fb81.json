Swan-upping must be one of the stranger rituals of a culture that enjoys its fair share of arcane ceremony: an ornithological census that takes place in July each year between Windsor and Abingdon, it is presided over by such Lewis Carroll characters as the Queen's swan marker and warden of the swans. The origins of their task \u2013 to round up and ring all the swans they find on the river \u2013 can be traced back to our medieval monarchs' weakness for swan meat. Today, the point is not to catch them for the kitchen, but to count, weigh and check them for signs of injury or disease. This is easier said than done. Having caught sight of a family of birds, the skiffs surround it, gradually closing in until the crew can pick up the cygnets and adult swans one by one. Their feet and wings are tied with soft cord and they are taken to the bank where, under the watchful eye of the warden, they are examined. For swan-upping is more than simply spectacle: it represents an important conservation effort. The census supplies scientists with data on the health of the swan population, and provides an opportunity for the marker and his team to teach local children about the importance of river wildlife. Its message of environmental stewardship means that this is one ancient ritual that makes particular modern sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
