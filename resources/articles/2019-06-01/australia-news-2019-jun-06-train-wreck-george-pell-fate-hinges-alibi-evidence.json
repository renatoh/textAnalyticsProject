The biggest was the unknown at the heart of George Pell\u2019s appeal: the weight these judges must give, after examining all the evidence for themselves, to the fact that a jury of 12 men and women sent Pell to jail. On the surface, the day was a train wreck. Despite all that\u2019s at stake, after all these years of work by police and lawyers, after two difficult trials and a verdict that made news around the world, the barrister whose job was to defend the jury\u2019s verdict, Christopher Boyce SC, found himself lost for words. The judges peppered him with questions. As he struggled to answer, the cardinal\u2019s counsel, Bret Walker SC, played with his fountain pen. Pell wrote notes. At a certain point in the day the tone of the interrogation shifted: the judges began prompting Boyce, bringing him back to his own argument. By late morning, a little knot of victims and their supporters had gathered in one of the corridors. They looked shell shocked. But appeals are not eisteddfods. Eloquence helps, and Boyce\u2019s stuttering and hesitation did nothing much to shore up the case against Pell. But these judges are not hanging on his words. They are all over the evidence. They\u2019ve read, watched and seen everything. But did the prosecution\u2019s day in court have to be as excruciating as this? So near the end, all sides seem to agree that the key to the cardinal\u2019s acquittal lies somewhere in handling of the evidence of Monsignor Charles Portelli, Pell\u2019s master of ceremonies at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Portelli gave Pell an alibi. He told the jury the archbishop couldn\u2019t possibly have abused choir boys in the sacristy because, first, His Grace lingered for some time on the steps of the cathedral talking to the faithful and, second, because he was always by Pell\u2019s side while the archbishop was robed in chasuble and alb. But the jury convicted nevertheless. What are the judges to make of this? Here is evidence that may raise reasonable doubts about Pell\u2019s guilt. If in their view it does, should they defer to the jury\u2019s view, or trust Portelli and reach a conclusion of their own? In the old days the argument was that juries saw witnesses in the flesh, while appeal judges read only the transcript. But in this case both the jury and the judges watched the same videos of Portelli and Pell\u2019s accuser giving evidence. So what\u2019s so special, the judges wondered, about the jury\u2019s verdict? Boyce failed to sing a mighty aria to the wonder of juries. \u201cIt would\u2026\u201d Silence. \u201cIt would\u2026\u201d Silence. \u201cCan I put this?\u201d Silence. \u201cI must say it is difficult.\u201d Pause. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for me to say what I said before.\u201d Pause. \u201cRehearsing the platitudes may not be all that helpful.\u201d Silence. Walker was staring at the ceiling. Pell was writing so much and so fast he seemed to be drafting his memoirs. The judges gave the lawyer a hand. He moved as quickly as he could to his next point \u2026 The transcript reads better than the experience in the room. Boyce enjoyed a little victory persuading the judges it\u2019s not impossible for an archbishop in chasuble, alb and cincture to take out his penis. The proof? The ability, by bunching up the robes, to go to the toilet, in Boyce\u2019s words, \u201cstanding up as a man\u201d. He invited the judges to try on a set of robes provided. They seemed keen on the idea. It would make a remarkable picture. Along the way one bright fragment came to light. Pell\u2019s supporters around the world claim with great passion that the first jury \u2013 the hung jury \u2013 split 10 to two in favour of acquitting the cardinal. It\u2019s a big thing with them. But on Thursday Justice Mark Weinberg said bluntly: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the numbers, nor should we.\u201d Despite the confusion of the day, there emerged a strong portrait of Pell\u2019s accuser, the ghost in this machine: a man who was neither a liar nor a fantasist, whose accusations sparked a huge police investigation and, at least for now, sent a cardinal to prison. The narrative is now in the hands of three Victorian judges. Their chief, Anne Ferguson, politely farewelled the public, the Pell supporters, the campaigners, the victims and their families, the press and the teams of lawyers packed into that ugly room: \u201cThe court will reserve its decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
