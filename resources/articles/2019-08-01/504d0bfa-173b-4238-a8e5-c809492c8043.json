The desperate wait for answers after a death in custody", "bodyText": "About 11pm on the night of 1 September last year, Nathan Reynolds \u201cbuzzed up\u201d to the guards for help in the minimum security jail he was in, on the western outskirts of Sydney. The 36-year-old Anaiwan man and father of one was having trouble breathing. He buzzed, and buzzed again. Then he came out to the communal area, and when the other inmates saw the state of him, they \u201cbuzzed up\u201d \u2013 called for help \u2013 from the guards too. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Reynolds, an asthmatic, reportedly said to them. While the details of what happened next are yet to be determined by the New South Wales coroner, Reynolds\u2019 family told Guardian Australia what they know, and what inmates told them. They say guards took 20 minutes to arrive. They came with a wheelchair, and tried to put Reynolds in it. \u201cHe slid straight out,\u201d his sister, Taleah Reynolds, said. The nurse was called. The outer metropolitan multi-purpose correctional centre does not have on-site medical staff, but the nurse, who serviced three jails in the immediate area, was within a 15-minute drive of the jail. After the nurse arrived, an ambulance was called. The inmates who had been helping Reynolds were, by this time, very distressed. Forty minutes had passed since the first call for help. \u201cThey had to yell at the end, they were screaming at the end, hurry up, he\u2019s going blue, he can\u2019t breathe, help us, you know, you\u2019ve got to help us,\u201d Reynolds\u2019 mother, Jodie, said. Reynolds was known to be asthmatic. He had been hospitalised the previous month after having an asthma attack. He had been to see the nurse that week to seek treatment, and had been given a Ventolin inhaler. However, the autopsy report shows that Reynolds was given naloxone that night, which is usually administered to reverse the effects of opioids \u2013 that is, it\u2019s given to somebody having a drug overdose. Reynolds was pronounced dead at about 12.20am. He was still on the common room floor when the ambulance arrived. \u201cThe thing I think about every night before I go to sleep is how Nathan had to die on a jail floor with no family, no one around; what a dirty place like that to die,\u201d Jodie said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201d Reynolds was a few days away from release after serving a four-month sentence for breaching a court order. It\u2019s almost a year since he died, but the brief of evidence on his death is not likely to be ready until early next year. Some time after that, the coroner will hear the case. \u201cThere\u2019s no timeline for anything,\u201d Taleah said. \u201cIt just goes on and on.\u201d \u201cI went to a funeral last week and I sat there and thought, once you have a funeral, that\u2019s your closure. But because of what\u2019s happened, there\u2019s no closure. We\u2019ve never had the time to mourn Nathan. \u201cAll I want to do is try and be strong, get through this and make those people accountable for what they\u2019ve done, but there is no moving forward, there is no light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Taleah said. Guardian Australia\u2019s Deaths Inside investigation found that families are waiting up to three years for coronial inquest findings. Indigenous people are dying in custody from treatable medical conditions, and are much less likely than non-Indigenous people to receive the care they need. When a person dies in custody, the police are required to notify the next of kin. In the small hours following Reynolds\u2019 death, police knocked on the door of his 80-year-old grandfather, where Reynolds had once lived. This was despite Taleah being listed in the jail records as Reynolds\u2019 next of kin. After waking his terminally ill grandfather, the police then went to Reynolds\u2019 mother\u2019s house. Jodie can\u2019t recall what time it was when the police arrived at her door. \u201cI was shocked at how cold it was. They said, \u2018we think your son has died in custody\u2019. I was shocked when they said that, not \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019. \u201cIt was just coldness, as if they were coming to say you have a parcel to pick up from the post office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should not have happened. If they\u2019d only responded a bit quicker, if they\u2019d thought to bring oxygen with them, he could be alive today. Something as simple as that. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a bad person, he wasn\u2019t hurting other peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d Taleah has taken on the role of family spokesperson. She deals with lawyers, police, officials. \u201cSomething needs to change,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve read that many coronial reports and findings. No one\u2019s ever held accountable. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they prioritising deaths in custody? Why does it take so long? We\u2019re coming up to a year since he died and we still don\u2019t know anything more. \u201cI feel like they don\u2019t have any remorse; they hide behind the system. No one\u2019s held accountable, that\u2019s the most frustrating part. The care factor is zilch. They don\u2019t care about the inmates.\u201d In a statement to Guardian Australia, Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW) said it \u201cextends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of a 36-year-old man who died at the outer metropolitan multi-purpose correctional centre about 12.20am on Saturday, 1 September 2018. \u201cAll aspects of the incident are being reviewed. As the matter is subject to a coronial inquest, it would be inappropriate to comment on the circumstances of the death. \u201cThe family raised a series of questions, which we responded to. \u201cWe are always willing to engage with the family and we encourage them to contact us if they ever have questions or need further information,\u201d CSNSW said. Taleah said the family wants answers, not engagement, and is tired of waiting. \u201cWhen you deal with a death in custody, it goes on for so long. And life goes on hold. \u201cSo I have to just be numb to it all. I haven\u2019t really mourned because I can\u2019t, because this is going to keep going on. Until this is over, I can\u2019t mourn him. \u201cI think if I mourn now, I\u2019ll just lose control, and I will break.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
