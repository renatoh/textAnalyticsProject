Continuing down the path of least resistance, the Australian musician has made an album of Christmas songs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to have an original idea to begin with,\u201d she explained in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like, Christmas, mistletoe, ho-ho-ho, Santa Claus, Christmas list, elves.\u201d It\u2019s not the most encouraging approach to songwriting, and the resulting album, a grab-bag of seasonal tropes that takes in snowflakes, puppies and candy canes, sounds suitably dashed off. Even if it sometimes amuses \u2013 Snowman is a love letter to a melting beau \u2013 there\u2019s a tendency towards repetition that seems lazy (Snowflake covers practically the same topic as Snowman; there is a bombastic ballad called Underneath the Mistletoe \u2013 and another called Underneath the Christmas Lights). That carelessness, combined with Sia\u2019s mewling, monotonous and oddly Scandi-accented vocal, means Everyday Is Christmas is unlikely to win over any nonbelievers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
