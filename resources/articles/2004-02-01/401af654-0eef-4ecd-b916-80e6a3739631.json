Now he is looking to shake up the quality end of the newspaper market again, with plans for a tabloid title with a serious-minded agenda. Glover is scouring the City for financing, trying to raise \u00a315m to cover launch costs - but will the money be enough, and will it be forthcoming? Mr Frame said \u00a315m would \"go nowhere\", arguing that more than \u00a350m would need to be pumped into this kind of project to get it off the ground and see it to profitability. Investors will in any case need to be convinced that there is enough demand out there for a sixth quality newspaper before they stump up their cash. Glover is said to have evidence from opinion polls that many readers of papers such as the Times and the Daily Telegraph are fed up with a perceived increase in lightweight showbiz or celebrity stories. \"I don't see there's a gap in the market - it's tough enough already,\" said Mr Frame. \"Look at the Mail on Sunday. It had a pretty traumatic first incarnation. It took the best part of 10 years to turn it round, with phenomenal investment from Associated.\" Glover will not be able to count on help from a rich parent company though - all the paper's losses would have to be sustained by the pot of cash put up beforehand by investors. The most recent national newspaper launch, of Richard Desmond's Daily Star Sunday, was able to rely on the profits at the rest of his media empire. But the costs of a paper aimed at the top end of the market, where editorial quality is of paramount importance, would be much higher. Some analysts believe there is potential in Glover's scheme, however, as long as the sums on his business plan add up. \"Yes, copy sales are falling,\" said one City analyst. \"But there's always room for more - you just need to make sure your cost base is in line. What kind of revenue do you need to survive?\" To win investors over, Glover will have to show that he can attract enough readers to recoup costs. If the paper sold 100,000 copies a day - less than half of the lowest selling broadsheet, the Independent - that would raise around \u00a315m a year at a cover price of 50p. On top of that, advertising revenues - which would to a large degree depend on sales figures - could be \u00a315m for the first year, City analysts have speculated. That would give potential revenues of \u00a330m, so if costs could be kept down to that level, the paper could break even. But what kind of paper would that be? Could a distinctive and editorially ambitious paper survive on that kind of budget? A highbrow contender for readers used to quality content would need to have expensive foreign bureaux, top-notch political staff and \"name\" commentators. Without any support from an existing operation that could soak up early losses and share some of the load of costs, it would be a challenge to break even. \"The core of your cost is editorial,\" one analyst said. \"There are a lot of fixed costs involved in getting to 100,000 sales - printing, paper, all kinds of things. But you have to do it yourself.\" Mr Frame put it starkly: \"You have got to look at why people are not doing it already. It's because they know it's not going to work.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
