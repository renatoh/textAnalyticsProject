I can just about hear him through the crash of the waves. \"Watch out for the tree stumps,\" he says. Oh my God. I knew sharks were a possibility, but underwater trees I hadn't bargained for. Just then I'm dragged under again by a tug on the lines and brace myself for a collision. Welcome to Kitesurf School, Hawaiian style. I'm on Maui, slap bang in the middle of the Hawaiian island chain, where being in the ocean is part of everyday life. Fishermen and sailors have the harbours, divers and snorkellers have the coral reefs, surfers have the waves and everyone else wants the wind. Occasionally, some of the sports overlap and when they do, tradition takes precedence. Surfing, the ancient Polynesian \"sport of kings\", as Jack London dubbed it, has been practised on the islands since the 12th century, so the surfers take the early morning waves. Most beaches have a blanket ban until 11am on windsurfing or kitesurfing. \"It's not much of a problem,\" says my teacher Aaron. \"The wind's stronger in the afternoon, anyway.\" Aaron is your typical bleached blond surfer. Except that, at 17, he's the two-time world kitesurfing champion, a tanned and lean young man who looks at the ocean with meaning. His accent, however, is pure Kent. Aaron was born and brought up in Maidstone, England. He's in Maui for the Red Bull King of the Air contest, but it's not his first trip to the islands. Although the sport was born in France in the 1970s, much of its development has taken place on the North Shore of Maui - local windsurfing legend Robby Naish is now the leading manufacturer of kites and boards. In the UK alone, a fair chunk of the 20,000-strong kitesurf community uses equipment he makes. I stand with Aaron looking out to sea where hundreds of kiters are zipping across the horizon like wakeboarders without the boats. Occasionally the kiters take to the skies with enormous leaps, before landing with a graceful splash in the warm Pacific. I only wish I could join them - my lesson with Aaron lasted two hours but you need at least five before you can confidently relaunch the kite should you drop it into the sea when you're off shore. Which you're bound to do. So I have to stay in the inner lagoon. I do, however, manage to launch from the beach, get dragged into the sea a couple of hundred metres and make it back to dry land in one piece. It's exhausting stuff. Against the backdrop of Maui's lush volcanoes, the scene from the beach is picture perfect. For surfers the world over, Hawaii is the dream location. The swaying palm trees are like beckoning fingers, the perfect surf a siren too beautiful to ignore. Films such as Blue Crush and The Billabong Odyssey show huge waves crashing in slow motion, while specialist magazines regularly devote entire issues to the oncoming Hawaiian winter season. Although it was California that sold modern surf culture to the world in the 1950s, hardcore surfers started to gravitate back to the birthplace of the sport in the 60s, often with little more than a board and enthusiasm. In doing so they brought energy and youth to the decaying towns in the remoter parts of the islands. Now the islands are steeped in surf culture. The North Shore of Maui is dotted with regenerated plantation towns such as Paia, where a couple of bars play host to the busy weekend party scene. Charlie's Bar is plastered with pictures of surfers and windsurfers and is often frequented by the stars of the photos. A few doors down is Jacques, a palm-lit, inexpensive restaurant with a resident Hawaiian band. For even cheaper eats, the Fish Market Restaurant is where people head to fill up on catch-of-the-day burgers. Many finish the evening on the beach opposite. To their credit, most come in search of genuine Hawaiiana, rather than staying in the tacky resorts that have been the mainstay of the tourist industry here since the 60s. In Paia, with its alternative coffee shops and health shacks, surf-specific lodges are beginning to spring up. Most people find their accommodation advertised on the door of the health food shop. You'd be hard pressed to get a double room for less than $100 a night, unless you take the plunge and rent a room in a house for a month. Well, if you really want to live the dream ...
