Suddenly you hear a roar building behind you: a little biplane shoots overhead, throwing loops in the bright blue sky, showing off. You watch it, amazed. A couple of local kids tumble up and stare at it, then stare at you as if your nose is green. Three scraggy dogs follow them, barking maniacally. The noisy scene fills you with the desire to throw your head back and laugh at its absurdity, laugh until your stomach is stiff. Picture that, and you'll have a small idea of the joy waiting for you in NoahJohn's second album. The scenes it calls to mind vary: sometimes it's lying lazily in a hammock on the porch watching your 13-year-old brother chase chickens round the yard on a Harley Davidson; or else walking home, profoundly drunk, singing to the stars while people in pyjamas throw false teeth and bedside lamps at you to try and shut you up. Whatever the image, the atmosphere is the same, caught between warm fuzziness and sparking, scrawling, spiralling bursts of energy. A frenzied calm, a placid raucousness: that's this album. Its reeling character comes from the collision of two very distinct musics: old-fashioned country and New York-style rock. There's a prosaic autobiographical reason behind this unholy marriage: 26-year-old frontman Carl Gustav Johns's own emigration from the family farm in Indiana to the chattering, clattering metropolis of Madison, Wisconsin. You can scoff, but anywhere with more houses than pick-up trucks is bound to make a boy from hicksville sporting a ridiculous moustache feel like picking up his guitar and wringing elation from every note. NoahJohn brings Johns together with four Madison musicians whom he could have met busking on the street or lying face down in a bar at midnight - no one really knows. They are the Velvet Underground gatecrashing a hoe-down and making merry with the local jug band; they're Lambchop slumming with the punks in CBGBs. It shouldn't make a bit of sense, but the two musics invigorate each other, bring a zingy freshness to any potential cliches. The conventional hillbilly tunes - Porter, Infirmary - stomp that much more vigorously; even the gentler, reflective songs - Had a Burning, Sister's Recital - can't resist ruffling the velvety surface to create a texture more abrasive and disordered. And the boisterous punk-injected songs - Surefire Woman, Wounded Rabbit, Ima Clam - are completely, consistently exhilarating. Wounded Rabbit begins innocuously enough, with one simple repeated chord. But then the drum bangs in and so does Stephen Burke's lap steel, careering wildly and arhythmically over the surface, closely followed by Eena Ballard's scraping viola. This exhilarating chaos is like watching a naughty child sliding down a muddy hill and itching to jump down after him. Listening to Ima Clam, you stop itching and leap. It's the whizzing guitar chords punching their way into the song at random intervals: their eccentricity is infectious. Even as the music has you bouncing rapturously, the lyrics make you want to sit still and pay attention - it's all part of the master plan to keep the album's elements in blissful disharmony. Like Will Oldham, Johns is at his best when he drops the chorus and tells a straight story. The narratives here are magical: as with the music, Johns presents familiar details - boys burying dead rabbits, uncles smoking Luckys, \"lightning bugs in jelly jars\" - but breathes new life into them. Sister's Recital, for instance, is narrated by a 10-year-old boy who, while his sister is playing at the school concert, discovers a window to a basement where other girls strip out of their leotards and wonders how \"I, a boy embarrassed by the word 'body' cannot look away\". It's a moment of extraordinary self-awareness, all the more affecting because it's sung with such tuneless fragility. Remarkably, Johns brings an equal emotion to the tale of Porter, the dog who gets stuck under the stove in his greedy search for heat and chicken scraps, and ends up out in the snow, dreaming of being a pup at his mother's teat again. There's no melody to Johns's voice, but it stretches across each song like a sheet of silver. If the album has a fault, it's the version of Loudon Wainwright III's Dead Skunk, and that's only because it reeks of novelty pop. But that's not a Johns song, so it doesn't count. What does count is that alternative country and New York punk are going to provide some of the most exciting music of this year, and NoahJohn are sat squarely between the two, offering the best of both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
