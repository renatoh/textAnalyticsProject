The former PM was invited to the five-star Hotel Bristol after addressing a rally of Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement party. But all eyes were on the 40-year-old Bruni, who every now and again lifted her sunglasses to lean in and nuzzle the presidential cheek. Sarkozy reciprocated with kisses and cuddles, oblivious of any uncomfortable fidgeting from those around them. Yesterday's social gathering, which included Justice Minister Rachida Dati and former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, was the latest display of a love that began just two months ago but is already prompting talk of weddings and babies. It was last November when, alone beneath the chandeliers in the quiet elegance of his official residence, the newly divorced President was bored. 'He called me,' says Jacques S\u00e9gu\u00e9la. 'He said: \"Invite me to dinner with your gang. I can't face any more evenings alone at the Elys\u00e9e Palace.\" Nicolas was very low.' Now he gives every appearance of being very high - in cabinet meetings the President has giggling fits - after advertising executive S\u00e9gu\u00e9la introduced Sarkozy, 52, to Bruni. A nation that had never so much as seen one of its Presidents wearing a T-shirt has been confronted with a whirlwind romance and the shock of seeing the photographers of even their more serious publications with lenses firmly trained on his ring finger and her tummy. Ex-second-wife C\u00e9cilia has a role in this Gallic soap opera, too. The President who promised a 'rupture' with the past has delivered an earth-shattering shift in France's relationship with power. But with six Paris-Match covers to his credit since his election in May, Sarkozy is winning the nickname 'President Bling-Bling', as suspicions grow he may be more style than substance. On that November evening, around the dining table at S\u00e9gu\u00e9la's home, conversation turned to model-turned-singer Bruni's forthcoming tour. 'I wanted to get a group of my left-wing friends together, to give Nicolas a run for his money,' said S\u00e9gu\u00e9la. So he invited music store magnate Denis Oliviennes and the beautiful Italian-born singer with anti-capitalist opinions. A few weeks earlier the pair had delivered a report to Sarkozy on music piracy. After dinner, the President escorted Bruni home to her flat. 'But nothing happened that night,' S\u00e9gu\u00e9la volunteered. 'I know that because Carla phoned me at two in the morning. She said: \"Your chum is strange. He asked for my number but he has not called me.\" They had only parted company five minutes earlier.' Sarkozy soon proved that he is no procrastinator. On 15 December - two months to the day after he and C\u00e9cilia ended their 11-year marriage by signing divorce papers - Sarkozy 'outed' Bruni as his girlfriend with a stroll at Disneyland Paris. Since then the spectre of C\u00e9cilia - now again involved with advertising mogul Richard Attias - has never gone away. On 23 December, Sarkozy threw a 40th birthday party for Bruni and gave her a \u20ac20,000 (\u00a315,000) Dior heart-shaped ring, designed by C\u00e9cilia's best friend, Victoire de Castellane. On Christmas Day the couple flew to Sharm el-Sheikh to meet up with the Blairs. Sarkozy gave Bruni a second ring while she gave him a \u20ac45,000 Patek Philippe watch. Last weekend they were photographed in Jordan - at the spot where C\u00e9cilia and Attias, in November 2005, first showed off their love affair. If the relationship turns out to be short-lived, French public opinion will no doubt turn on Bruni. Her respected transition from modelling to singing - including a first album, Quelqu'un m'a dit (Someone Told Me), which sold more than two million copies - will be obliterated by her inglorious track record. Bruni is better known for her colourful boyfriends - Eric Clapton, Kevin Costner, former Socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, and a few more. Jerry Hall had a stand-up row with her over an alleged fax she sent Mick Jagger saying 'let's spend the night together'. Novelist Justine Levy's 2004 bestseller Rien de Grave (Nothing Serious) tells the thinly disguised story of how Paula (Bruni) stole her boyfriend, Adrien. In the book, Paula is a 'Terminator' who still 'sees all her ex-lovers because she has slept with the entire planet, so she has to'. L\u00e9vy is the daughter of philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy and the former girlfriend of Raphael Enthoven, 29, son of philosopher Jean-Paul Enthoven. Bruni lived with Enthoven senior before having a son with Enthoven junior. On Wednesday, the Italian daily La Repubblica pointed out snidely: 'C\u00e9cilia may not have happy memories of her ex-husband but at least she knows to keep quiet. Carla on the other hand tends to write songs about her lovers, even to mock them.' But in the past week C\u00e9cilia has spectacularly broken her silence. On Thursday three books went on sale telling of the Sarkozys' marriage. On Friday, she failed in court to have one of them banned. Even though Le Point journalist Anna Bitton's book, C\u00e9cilia, is based on five years of authorised interviews, the former first lady believes it goes too far. The book paints Sarkozy as an unreconstructed adolescent who enjoys all-night karaoke parties, does not love his children and is a womaniser. The French media are now divided between supporters of Nicolas and C\u00e9cilia. Glossing over the nine-point collapse in Sarkozy's confidence rating since June, Friday's Le Figaro produced a poll showing 60 per cent of respondents welcomed Sarkozy's openness over Bruni. But a survey in Le Parisien, for which C\u00e9cilia is 'a heroine', had only 39 per cent feeling confident in Sarkozy. The enduring effect of the Bruni-Sarkozy saga will be to wipe out the French media's silence over politicians' private lives. The love child of President Mitterrand was first seen at his funeral. Journalists kept quiet on President Chirac's numerous affairs. But it has taken just a few weeks for the country's privacy laws to seem a distant memory. The shift has come not from the media, but from an image-hungry Sarkozy, who is accused of using his private life to obscure political failures. The President's divorce was announced on 18 October, the day of a huge transport strike. Bruni's first public appearance on Sarkozy's arm came as the media were focusing on a state visit to Paris by Libya's Muammar Gadaffi. At his New Year press conference last Tuesday, Sarkozy titillated reporters with the idea of a secret marriage to Bruni and fobbed off a question about his government's failure to boost consumer spending power. Sarkozy's record since his election includes giving himself a pay increase of between 172 and 206 per cent - depending on whose figures you use - and cutting wealth tax to woo back rich exiles like crooner Johnny Hallyday (who still has not returned). Sarkozy last week backed down on his assertion that the 35-hour week would be phased out in 2008. An action plan for France's riot-prone city suburbs has been downgraded to a ministerial mission. The President's much-heralded clampdown on benefit fraud has become bogged down in vague wording. Among his few successes has been to take a leading role in pushing through the mini-treaty for the EU constitution. According to satirical weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, even Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon is exasperated. 'He giggles at anything. He just wants to tell jokes or talk about bums. When we talk to the President, he does not always listen. He cancels meetings, which is not like him. Where will it end?' The advantage of it ending in nuptials would be to create a first lady. This would do away with protocol problems in India, where Sarkozy is expected for a state visit on 24 January. It is understood that Bruni will not accompany Sarkozy on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates due to start today. Her 5ft 7in stature would be welcomed by France's fashion designers. 'There has to be a first lady in the Elys\u00e9e. So why not a beautiful one?' asked Jean-Paul Gaultier. Karl Lagerfeld said: 'She has class, she is well educated and speaks several languages. I see only quality.' She is no Cinderella, either. Brought up at the family pile near Turin, Bruni's childhood was spent in a wonderland of crystal chandeliers and architectural elegance. Not that different from the Elys\u00e9e. Life and loves of Carla Mick Jagger Bruni started a serious affair with him in 1992. They went on holiday to Thailand a day after his partner, Jerry Hall, gave birth to his daughter Georgia. 'The relationship with Mick was always much more of a friendship. I never had a passionate, crazy thing with him. I think he's a great person. He has a great talent and an incredible personality. There was no ego.' Jean-Paul and Raphael Enthoven Bruni was living with writer Jean-Paul Enthoven, when she started an aff air with his philosopher son, Raphael, pictured below. Raphael, the father of Bruni's son, Aurelian, was married at the time to author Justine Levy. A 'cool, free man' - says Bruni - Raphael is 10 years her junior and a leading light of the French intellectual scene. Eric Clapton Bruni was 22, half Clapton's age, when they had a four-month fling in 1990. It ended when Clapton said publicly: 'I'm in love but not with someone who could become a partner.' Bruni claims she was just 'much too young'. Vincent Perez Perez, a Swiss-born star of French stage and cinema, went out with Bruni in the mid-1990s during the period of her secret, on-off relationship with Jagger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
