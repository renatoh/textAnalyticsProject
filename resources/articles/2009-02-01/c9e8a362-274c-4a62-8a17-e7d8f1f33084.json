The Blackburn manager, who lasted eight months in charge of Newcastle, expressed his concerns after Luiz Felipe Scolari and Tony Adams lost their jobs at Chelsea and Portsmouth in the past week. He said: \"There is no time any more. There is only instant success and, as managers, we have to live with that scenario. We are fast becoming more and more dispensable. The Premier League is the best league in the world but the most difficult to manage in.\" Newcastle's Joe Kinnear is also feeling the strain and was due to undergo a heart bypass operation today. \"I wish him a speedy recovery and hope he is back as soon as possible,\" said Allardyce. \"You do put yourself at risk because you are constantly thinking about others than yourself. Every time you go on the touchline you risk your health. You have to take time out to look after yourself.\" Allardyce takes a breather from Blackburn's battle against relegation with a home tie against his former club Coventry in the fifth round of the FA Cup tomorrow. Allardyce said: \"I still have lodged in my mind very vividly losing a penalty shoot-out against Aston Villa in the semi-final in 2000. It was a game we [Bolton] should have won but Dean Holdsworth missed an absolute sitter near the end. The excitement and build-up to that game at Wembley was massive, so it is important we put aside all our troubles in Premier League and think only of the glory of the FA Cup.\" Allardyce expects a tough game against Chris Coleman's Coventry after the Championship side scored a 4-1 victory at Ewood Park in last season's competition. He said: \"They are in good form and will come with confidence and probably play above themselves. \"Some of our players will still have it fresh in their mind what happened last year when we got a good thrashing, so we will have to be at our best.\" Blackburn will be without El-Hadji Diouf and Aaron Mokoena, because they are ineligible and suspended respectively, and Allardyce will use some of his fringe players. \"You have to use your squad to the full,\" he said. \"It makes perfect sense.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
