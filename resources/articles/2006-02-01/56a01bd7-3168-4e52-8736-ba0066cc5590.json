In public, both pay easy lip service to their \"brotherly\" relations with each another. But in private, bitter tensions are bubbling over and one issue stands out - their mutual border. Asked after the meeting whether he was sure of Pakistan's cooperation in battling the Taliban, Mr Karzai cautiously replied that \"there are areas where we are seeking more cooperation\". That is a considerable understatement - he blames Pakistan for the bloody surge in Taliban attacks that has rocked southern Afghanistan. A rash of suicide bombings - until recently a rarity - has killed around 70 people including foreign peacekeepers, local police, a Canadian diplomat and dozens of innocent civilians over the past three months. Angry Afghan officials, from cabinet level to village police chiefs, say the militants are streaming across the Pakistani border, a 1,500-mile stretch of desert, mountain and sand. At best, they say, Islamabad is turning a blind eye to the infiltration. At worst, it is directly supporting it. \"The terrorists who come here for suicide attacks are attending training bases in Pakistan and are getting all their equipment there,\" the Afghan interior ministry spokesman, Yousuf Stanezai, said. As an example, officials pointed to a pair of would-be Pakistani suicide bombers arrested in Kandahar a few weeks ago. Perhaps uncoincidentally, a transcript of their interrogation was leaked to the New York Times on the eve of Mr Karzai's visit. Gen Musharraf's western allies are also becoming impatient over his failure to master the border area. Last month, US hellfire missiles destroyed a house in the Bajaur district in which the al-Qaida number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was thought to be hiding. The bombs missed Zawahiri, instead killing 13 villagers. The Pakistani president and his officers angrily deny any complicity with the Taliban, which they effectively created in the early 90s but publicly shunned after 2001. To demonstrate their innocence, they have pointed to the deployment of 70,000 Pakistani troops along the Afghan border. Last summer, I travelled to the controversial border with the Pakistani army. In Angoor Adda, a remote outpost amid scrabbly desert and craggy peaks, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel GM Awan, scanned the border before passing me his binoculars. \"Look,\" he said, indicating a line of Pakistani sentry posts. \"We are guarding every hill and gully.\" Then he pointed accusingly towards a lone hut on the far side of the border. \"That is the only American and Afghan position around here,\" he said. \"So if anybody can slip across, it is their fault and not ours.\" The truth, however, is almost certainly much murkier. The Pakistani forces are concentrated in just two tribal agencies - North and Waziristan - which are hotbeds of militant activity but cover only a small patch of the border. By contrast, hundreds of Taliban are believed to be sheltering in Baluchistan, the sprawling province to the west. Here, the border is effectively a swinging door for the militants. The proof is not difficult to find - black-turbaned militants can be seen roaming freely in Quetta, the main city. For Pakistan's western allies, the great unknown is whether the Taliban are simply tolerated by the authorities in Quetta, or whether they enjoy covert support, possibly as part of a policy to retain good relations with an old ally. One popular theory is that sympathetic elements of the ISI spy agency - either serving or retired - are helping to shelter them, but most diplomats admit they simply don't know. \"We have asked them to clean up Quetta,\" one senior western official, who has aired the Taliban issue directly with Gen Musharraf, said. \"They tell us to provide names and addresses.\" Gen Musharraf's officers say it is impossible to tell one Pashtun - the Taliban's tribe - from another, because they flit across the border along centuries-old trails. A black turban, they add, is not necessarily a sign of militancy. The issue is likely to become increasingly important to Britain as 3,300 UK troops are deployed to Helmand, a volatile Afghan province touching Baluchistan, over the coming months. One British diplomat speculated that if the Taliban killed any British soldiers - a likely prospect, given the current levels of violence - then the quiet prodding of Gen Musharraf might become more forceful. \"We will certainly want to see some changes,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
