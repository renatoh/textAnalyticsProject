You've no money for buying software and, quite frankly, Access looks a bit complex for year one then you think \"Internet!\" You've heard there is a reservoir of resources \"out there\", wherever that is. All you have to do is log on, run a quick search and turn up dozens of valuable websites. Barely able to contain your excitement, you visit www.google.com, a speedy and reliable search engine, and type in \"literacy\". In just 0.1 of a second your screen is full of website addresses - 1,480,000 of them - which just might stretch you during your one non-contact half hour of the week. How do teachers source and use websites effectively? Finding reliable titles is a problem: there are too many and, unlike print publications, you can't flick through in a few minutes to get a feel for them. You can pick them up from colleagues, professional associations, educational journals, newspapers such as the Guardian, and the Teem (Teachers Evaluating Educational Multimedia) website, which contains evaluations and case studies of websites written and researched by teachers. If you're new to the net, what should you be looking for and how do you spot worthwhile resources for your children? You have already adopted a range of critical skills when you research and buy other resources for school: now it's time to develop them for working on the internet. This brief guide might be a useful tick list to use when you are looking at a new site: \u0095 Who published it? The internet is ruthlessly democratic in the presentation of information, with no perceived hierarchy. Is the site produced by a reputable organisation, or by an amateur hobbyist or by an organisation pursuing its own agenda? \u0095 Is it up-to-date? A website offering information on political history might be of limited value if it hasn't been updated for a couple of years, whereas an art website with free painting downloads isn't so time-sensitive. \u0095 How quickly does it download? Once accessed, it might contain fantastic resources, but have you got time to watch a fancy moving icon on screen as the class grows increasingly restless? Sharp, well-defined images are wonderful but not if they slow down the lesson. \u0095 Is it really an educational site with classroom relevance or does it contain wonderful ideas that aren't relevant to the national curriculum? \u0095 Will your children be able to navigate the site with ease? Some icon buttons might not be clear to users or they might not always appear on the screen as the child scrolls up and down. Watch out for these features, too: Do you need downloadable plug-ins to make the site work? Is the site linked to other sites? This can be a strength and a weakness: you might discover yet more information but your children might wander off into uncharted territory of unsuitable material. What's the reading level? Is it consistent with the content? Is there evidence of bias? There may be some tempting PSHE and RE sites to visit, but who has written them - and why? This looks like a formidable list to work through but, after a while, you'll automatically check for them. But what of that search for literacy materials? Is it possible to reduce our options from nearly 1.5m matches to something more manageable? A search using \"KS1 literacy hour resources\" yielded 381 matches, which if they were books on a library shelf would still represent rather too many to read in one sitting. But by reading the short descriptions under each address you quickly recognise the ones which may be of value to you. Try out a few likely looking sites and, if you like them, add them to your favourites. Now try them out against the checklists above and find ways of integrating them into your teaching. Teem helps by providing evaluations and case studies of websites written by Teem-trained teachers. They work to a framework which enables all aspects of the site to be written about in the evaluation; the case study tells of the classroom context in which the site was used. \u0095 For more information on Teem, visit www.teem.org.uk, email info@teem.org.uk, or call (01223) 505207.
