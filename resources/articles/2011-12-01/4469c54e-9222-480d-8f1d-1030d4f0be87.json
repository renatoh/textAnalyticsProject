More than 25,000 shops have closed since the millennium and Portas described the situation in the starkest of terms: \"Many [high streets] are sickly, others are on the critical list and some now are dead,\" she said following a seven-month investigation into the future of the high street. \"They have reached a crisis point. Unless urgent action is taken much of Britain will lose, irretrievably, something that is fundamental to our society.\" Portas said the exercise was not about \"pointing fingers of blame\" but the report attacked the rapacious growth of the supermarkets and warned that high streets needed to find a new raison d'etre \u2013 beyond retail \u2013 to survive. The TV presenter told the Guardian there were \"too many\" supermarkets but after four Competition Commission inquiries maintained the status quo she saw little scope to bring about change in this area: \"I would stop it [supermarket expansion],\" Portas said. \"But to a certain extent the horse has bolted . We have let supermarkets do this and they have. The only way we can fight it is to create something different.\" The Portas review makes 28 recommendations including establishing \"town teams\" to champion local high streets, business rate concessions for entrepreneurs and penalties for negligent landlords. Portas also urged that betting shops have their own planning classification so their numbers could be monitored more closely. \"I believe the influx of betting shops, often into more deprived areas, is blighting our high streets,\" she said. The wide-ranging report also suggested that defunct stores be turned into gyms, creches and bingo halls to kick start community regeneration as well as a \"National Market Day\" to drive footfall on to local high streets. Outside central London, visitors to local high streets had fallen by around 10% over the last three years said the report. Expansion of the major supermarkets is considered one of the biggest factors behind high street decline. For every \u00a31 spent in UK shops nearly 50p is spent on food and groceries with the country's 8,000 supermarkets speaking for more than 97% of grocery sales and a growing percentage of non-food sales. Portas highlighted her concerns about the \"progressive sprawl\" of supermarkets into areas such as doctor surgeries and opticians that were once the exclusive preserve of the high street. \"These critical high street and town centre services must not simply be gobbled up by major supermarkets,\" she said. \"It really worries me that the big supermarkets don't justsell food anymore, but all manner of things that people used to buy on the high street.\" The supermarket business model relies on high sales volumes to cut prices but Portas said: \"We need a more sophisticated understanding of what is a good deal for consumers looking beyond price.\" The decision to allow so many out-of-town retail parks and shopping malls to be built was also lamented and Portas urged that the secretary of state should have an \"exceptional sign off\" on any new out-of-town developments. She also suggested all large new developments to have a quota of \"affordable shops\" to foster start-ups and diversity. Other recommendations included removing unnecessary regulations to make it easier for people to become market traders and a parking league table so shoppers could see how their town compared on charges. With a background working in luxury stores such as Harvey Nichols and Harrods, the Mary Queen of Frocks TV presenter was a controversial choice to carry out the report, but in the end it was largely welcomed by business groups. \"Prioritising action on business rates and parking is exactly right. These are the key concerns for customers and retailers,\" said Stephen Robertson, general director of British Retail Consortium. Portas injected the kind of drama used in her TV shows rather than stuffy government reports. One section is titled \"my vision\" and some of her ideas, including a comeback for bingo halls -\u2013 many killed off by the smoking ban \u2013 alongside yoga studios and markets reminiscent of either German Christmas markets or the flea markets of Paris, raised eyebrows. Peter Box, of the Local Government Association, said: \"While some of the report's recommendations are positive, such as cracking down on the number of new betting shops, we are extremely concerned that removing regulations around market stalls will result in rogue traders taking advantage of cash-strapped families and flooding the market with dangerous and counterfeit goods.\" Portas was accompanied by the prime minister as she visited markets and a cafe in Camden, north London, a vibrant commercial area that she said was not necessarily typical of the \"dead\" centres described in the report. \"High streets have become too hollowed out, too many empty shops,\" said David Cameron. \"We desperately need lively attractive high streets and I think Mary Portas has given us the blueprint.\" The retail brief will be handed to a minister in either the business or the communities and local government departments. Key recommendations Town teams to run town centres like a business with a management team comprised of landlords, shopkeepers, council representatives and residents. National Market Day to drum up interest in markets and reduce regulations so that more people can become market traders. An out-of-town veto giving ministers an \"exceptional sign-off\" on new out-of-town developments. Betting shops should have their own planning label so their expansion can be tracked more closely. They are currently classed as \"financial and professional services\". Penalise landlords for leaving stores empty. Business rate concessions to offer the same discount given to charity shops to retail startups and small businesses. Free controlled parking should be set up by local authorities, with a league table to make charges transparent. Major retailers should report on their support of local high streets in their annual report.* Make big retailers report on their support of local high streets in their annual report. Cut red tape to make it easier for high streets to prosper"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
