Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that that chamber would vote a criminal justice reform measure before the end of year, yielding to pressure from Trump. The CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, testified before the House Judiciary Committee. A federal judge ruled Stormy Daniels liable for nearly $300,000 in attorney\u2019s fees in litigation with Donald Trump. The Senate just passed the farm bill by an overwhelming margin. It still has to go to the House but the $867 billion legislation which also legalizes hemp in addition to providing subsidies for farmers and funding food stamps is expected to pass easily. Sarah Sanders has defended her decision to scale back White House press briefings at an event in Washington today. Michael Avenatti is brushing off the verdict on Twitter and insisting that Stormy Daniels will inevitably come out on top. Trump apparently is still saying that Mexico will pay for the wall. Jeff Sessions quoted Kanye West to praise Donald Trump at an event today. A federal judge has ordered Stormy Daniels to pay Donald Trump nearly $300,000 in attorney\u2019s fees in a ruling just issued. Trump\u2019s attorney celebrated the ruling in a statement. Per pool, Trump said in the Oval Office at a bill signing just now. \u201cIf we have to close down the county in border security I actually like that in terms of an issue.\u201d\u201d Mike Pence cast his 12th tiebreaking vote in the Senate today since being elected Vice President and it was a first. There will be a hearing next year on Paul Manafort\u2019s alleged lies to prosecutors ahead of his sentencing. A federal judge scheduled a hearing today for January 25, 2019. San Diego Democrat Scott Peters is contemplating leaving Congress to run for mayor of his hometown. Peters was first elected in 2012. Pelosi also apparently used an interesting analogy today. Nancy Pelosi is apparently taking shots at Trump to the Democratic caucus after their meeting. John Kelly is now staying on as chief of staff into 2019. In an interview with Fox News, Kellyanne Conway said: \u201cHe will stay on the job through January 2 at least, and I think there will be a very peaceful and pragmatic transition to the next chief of staff.\u201d Potential 2020 Democratic candidates are starting an internal debate about whether they should use superPACs in the presidential primary. The New York Times reports: But as three dozen Democrats ponder presidential runs in 2020 and begin to design their campaign infrastructures, some leading names beyond Senator Bernie Sanders are expected to forgo or disavow super PACs \u2014 and with it the ability for allies to raise unlimited sums from wealthy backers \u2014 in hopes that grass-roots donors and progressive activists would reward them more handsomely in the primary for rejecting such funds. Pelosi and Schumer have put out a brief joint statement on the meeting. In House leadership news, Democrats are apparently postponing the fight over term limits for committee chairs until next year. One Senate Democrat is already reacting to the White House meeting. Schumer is already characterizing Trump as throwing a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d in the Oval Office. In other news, Trump now says there is no rush to find a new White House chief of staff. Trump threatens a shutdown if he doesn\u2019t get his way on the wall. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get what we want one way or the other, whether it\u2019s through you, it\u2019s through military, I will shut down the government. I am proud to shutdown the government for border security . . . I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\u201d As this continues, it\u2019s worth noting Mike Pence has sat silently the entire time as Trump bickers with Schumer and Pelosi. They are now bickering about the 2018 election and Schumer turns to the cameras; \u201cWhen the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he\u2019s in trouble.\u201d Trump responds: \u201cBut I did!\u201d Pelosi looks at the cameras and says \u201cthis is spiraling downwards\u201d as the bickering continues in the Oval Office. Schumer is now urging Trump not to shut down the government. Trump responds: \u201cIf it\u2019s not good border security, I won\u2019t take it.\u201d Trump is repeatedly interrupting Pelosi and calling her \u201cNancy\u201d as she insists he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the House for the wall. Pelosi seems uncomfortable with the cameras there. Trump makes a false claim about wall construction in the Oval Office. There are some highlights from the pool report of the Oval Office meeting with Pelosi and Schumer which is being played back on cable news right now. \u201cI am proud to shut down the government over border security,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will take the mantle.\u201d Pelosi and Schumer also delivered remarks, with Pelosi calling a government shutdown a \u201cTrump shutdown\u201d. Trump starts off the Oval Office meeting by insisting that criminal justice reform \u201clooks like it is going to be passing\u201d and in a \u201cvery bipartisan way.\u201d McConnell said he would bring up for a vote later this week. The Oval Office meeting with Pelosi and Schumer seems to be getting tense. In non-Google news, Trump, Pelosi and Schumer are having a heated argument about a border wall in the Oval Office. Pichai says \u201cright now we have no plans to launch a search engine in China\u201d when asked about Dragonfly. The hearing was just briefly interrupted by a protestor holding a sign. The first truly interesting question of the day is from Sheila Jackson Lee, who asks about Project Dragonfly, a reported plan for Google to build a censored search engine in China. Unfortunately, Pichai sticks to Google\u2019s talking point \u2013 \u201cRight now there are no plans to launch search in China\u201d \u2013 and Jackson Lee does not follow up. The back-and-forth between Lamar Smith and Sundar Pichai is indicative of the unreasonableness of certain Republicans on the largely specious question of partisan bias in search results. Smith raised some questionable studies; Pichai pointed out that Google disagrees with their methodology. Smith: \u201cWhat does methodology have to do with the fact that 96% of the references to Trump are from liberal media?\u201d Pichai doesn\u2019t respond, but methodology has a lot to do with that \u201cfact\u201d. Smith: \u201cYou never sanctioned any employee for manipulating the search results.\u201d Pichai: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for an individual or groups of employees to manipulate our search results\u2026\u201d Smith: \u201cI disagree.\u201d Pichai has been asked about steps he will take to counter right wing extremism on You Tube. Pichai\u2019s prepared testimony, which he is reading now, is focused on parrying the allegations of political bias: \u201cI lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions\u2014and we have no shortage of them among our own employees. Some of our Googlers are former servicemen and women who have risked much in defense of our country. Some are civil libertarians who fiercely defend freedom of expression. Some are parents who worry about the role technology plays in our households. Some\u2014like me\u2014are immigrants to this country, profoundly grateful for the freedoms and opportunities it offers. Some of us are many of these things.\u201d The opening statements from Kevin McCarthy, Bob Goodlatte and Jerry Nadler give a preview of the major issues that we\u2019ll hear about today. McCarthy, who spoke as a witness, focused on Google\u2019s Project Dragonfly, a plan to produce a censored search engine for China. \u201cAre America\u2019s tech companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d McCarthy asked. Goodlatte, who appears well versed in how Google\u2019s products work, noted, \u201cGoogle is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush.\u201d He also spent several minutes discussing the troubling nature of \u201callegations Google manipulates its algorithms to favor the political party its likes, the ideas it likes or the products it likes\u201d \u2013 allegations that he offered no evidence for. Nadler points out that \u201cno credible evidence supports this rightwing conspiracy theory\u201d, but that will not stop Republican representatives from spending a considerable amount of time on it today. Sunder Pichai is now reading his prepared testimony which is available here. Both Bob Goodlatte, the outgoing chair of the Judiciary Committee and Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat who will take over in January, have given opening statements and Pichai will now begin his prepared remarks Google CEO Sunder Pichai has taken his seat in the House Judiciary hearing room and opening statements have begun before his testimony. Several Democratic senators sent a letter to the White House yesterday asking questions about Fox News\u2019s bonus payments to top communications aide Bill Shine. Shine left Fox News last year after facing allegations that he helped cover up serial sexual harassment by Roger Ailes. As CNBC reports: The senators\u2019 letter is addressed to acting White House counsel Emmet Flood. In it, the lawmakers argue that the payments Shine received when he departed the network and the millions he continues to rake in may be in breach of ethic laws. \u201c21st Century\u2019s Fox\u2019s previous and ongoing payments to Mr. Shine of millions of dollars in severance payments raise questions about his compliance with federal conflict of interest statutes and regulations,\u201d they wrote. Mitch McConnell has just announced that Senate will take up criminal justice reform legislation. The First Step Act had been pushed by President Donald Trump but had divided the Senate Republican caucus. However, a majority of Senate Republicans eventually have embraced the deal, which is expected to be supported by most Democrats. Tablet Magazine has an impressive investigation inside the Women\u2019s March with some shocking revelations about the umbrella group that sponsored anti-Trump protests the day after the inauguration in 2017. The group\u2019s co-chairs have repeatedly made anti-semitic remarks and it has contracted with Louis Farrakhan\u2019s Nation of Islam to provide security. Anti-semitism first raised its head in the group\u2019s initial meeting It was there that, as the women were opening up about their backgrounds and personal investments in creating a resistance movement to Trump, Perez and Mallory allegedly first asserted that Jewish people bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people\u2014and even, according to a close secondhand source, claimed that Jews were proven to have been leaders of the American slave trade. These are canards popularized by The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, a book published by Louis Farrakhan\u2019s Nation of Islam\u2014\u201cthe bible of the new anti-Semitism,\u201d according to Henry Louis Gates Jr., who noted in 1992: \u201cAmong significant sectors of the black community, this brief has become a credo of a new philosophy of black self-affirmation.\u201d Things seem very calm and normal outside the House Judiciary Committee before Sunder Pichai\u2019s testimony Nancy Pelosi is reportedly discussing a deal to limit her tenure as Speaker to four years with Democratic rebels. The septuagenarian Pelosi who needs the support of 218 Democrats on the floor in January had previously refused to back any term limits. Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai will testify before Congress this morning as my colleague Julia Carrie Wong reports: Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, is set to testify before the House judiciary committee on Tuesday morning, three months after his company thumbed its nose at Congress by failing to appear alongside Facebook and Twitter at a Senate hearing on election interference. Pichai will probably face questions on data and privacy issues, Google\u2019s controversial plan to build a censored search engine for China, and allegations of partisan political bias \u2013 a subject of outsized fixation for Republican lawmakers. In written testimony released on Monday, Pichai appeared intent on countering the narrative, which has been baselessly promoted by Donald Trump and other Republican politicians, that Google is suppressing conservative viewpoints on its platforms. Mark Meadows tells reporters that he has yet to talk about the position of White House chief of staff that he has been floated for. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has been mooted as a potential primary challenger to Trump, has struck some unsubtle never-Trump notes while speaking at a conference of conservative Trump skeptics this morning. Trump supporters in New Hampshire are contemplating an effort to change state party rules and allow the New Hampshire GOP to formally endorse Trump\u2019s re-election. The change would be a major break in tradition in the first-in-the-nation primary state and further stack the deck against any 2020 primary challenger to Trump. A former Trump campaign staffer who accused the campaign of sexual harassment has been ordered to pay almost $25,000 for violating a nondisclosure agreement with Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Jessica Denson had previously sued to void that agreement claiming that she suffered \u201cpervasive slander, aggravated harassment, attempted theft, cyberbullying and sexual discrimination and harassment\u201d from her supervisor. The campaign took her to an arbitration proceeding where Denson did not participate where it was awarded $24,808 . The former staffer is now suing Trump\u2019s campaign over the arbitrator\u2019s award Good morning. Donald Trump is meeting with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi at the White House today about a looming government shutdown, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is testifying on Capitol Hill and Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyers will appear in court in Washington this afternoon. It\u2019s Tuesday in American politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
