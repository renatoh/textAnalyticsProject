This meeting of the dames offered so many enticements. The encounter between Judi Dench and Maggie Smith promised to be more than a meeting of two theatrical styles. Two strands of British character - cavalier and roundhead - were to be displayed. Some observers (would the excitement about rivalry have run so high if male actors had been starring?) hoped for a bitchfest. That all this should occur in a play by one of our most assured dramatists made it irresistible. But despite its high profile, The Breath of Life is a low-key evening. David Hare's play - in which two sixty-something women who have had a man in common (as the husband of one and the lover of the other) look back on their lives, while resolving not to live in the past - is unfocused and wispy. Every time you think it's going to be about something, it evaporates. Dench is the wife: a novelist deter mined to pop all human life into the maw of her fiction. The question of how people make sense of their own histories - by seeing them as stories or accumulating facts - is floated, but drifts away unexamined. Smith, the independent-minded mistress (she eats take-aways and doesn't clear them up) spent her student years in an America that she has now repudiated. The play approaches the idea that the British love-affair with America is souring - but never goes into it. The only thing really mulled over is the mild fixation ('obsession' would suggest too fiery a state) of two supposedly thoughtful women for a man who never appears and is never made vivid. But whatever male dramatists and directors (Howard Davies) may like to think, a man in himself isn't enough of a subject to set a stage on fire. There are glimmers of what might have been. At a time when there's a tendency to think that great stage acting means semaphore gestures and obtrusive emphases, Dench and Smith show what can be achieved by barely moving and simply nudging a phrase. Dench (whose part is underwritten, making her little more than a semi-reflective mouse) suggests a lifetime of wary resolution as she tucks her scarf around her. Smith (who has all the most pointed lines, but delivers them lightly without doing her Kenneth Williams impersonation) indicates decades of sardonic impatience by drumming her fingers against a book. And in one brief episode both do something of which few actors are capable within full view of an audience. They age. You're hardly aware of it at first - it's like a slow fading of light - but Smith changes colour, becoming less vivid, more drained and white by the second. And Dench shrinks, crumpling into herself like a ball of tissue paper. These conjuring minutes are almost worth the price of the tickets. A different visual magic is practised by the director-designer-deviser Robert Lepage, who, in collaboration with the dramatist Sophie Faucher, is re-creating the internal landscape of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Kahlo admired Stalin, went to bed with Trotsky, and married the domineering artist Diego Rivera - a megalomaniac who boomed a lot about sharing his love of humanity. Crippled by childhood polio and scarred by a tram accident, she painted gipsylike self-portraits, from which she stares out boldly, sometimes over a thick moustache. La Casa Azul makes a surrealistic collage of her life by drawing on pictures and diaries. In a luminous blue box design, a figure appears, adorned with a gorgeous flower-bedecked hat, glowing with the pinks and purples of Kahlo's paintings. She doffs it - to reveal a shiny bald pate: this proves to be the recurrent figure of Death. Frida is spreadeagled on a four-poster bed, which tips itself up to become the wall of a room. A nurse probes Diego for testicular cancer, and reveals that his penis is a gun. Rivera and Kahlo decide to get married for the second time. Through the windows of the registry office you glimpse a black-and-white film. Within, the groom has a monkey on his shoulder and a medical certificate explaining that an 'illness' means he can't be faithful. The bride is in a wheelchair, en route to her mistress. A sheet of gauze at the front of the stage serves as a screen. At one point this contains images from Rivera's Rockefeller Centre mural, broken into rubble when its sponsors spotted the figure of Lenin. At all points, it makes a misty distance between action and audience in a show self-consciously bent on presenting pain as art. There won't be many more exquisite evenings this year. And few more annoying ones. It dangles its agonies like ear-rings. There is nothing rarefied, everything urgent about the South African company now known as Full Colour. Having breathed new life into the Chester Mystery Cycle, they are now re-animating The Beggar's Opera. In Mark Dornford-May and Charles Hazelwood's interpretation - set on a bare stage overhung by nooses - eighteenth-century airs are interlaced with marimbas, cymbals and tambourines, sometimes within one song. A question is asked in English and answered in Zulu. You hear sounds - a swelling chorus of men humming - that you hardly hear outside spirituals. A solitary woman's powerful voice floats down from high up in the gallery of the beautiful music hall. When Macheath sings for his life at Tyburn, he sobs with real anguish. This is not satire, but documentary, sung by a cast (containing only one white) whose governments have acquainted them with arbitrary imprisonment: the singers are on the beggars' side. The spoken parts are indistinct and the acting of a stretchy-eyed, cartoonish kind. But this barely matters: the music is glorious. And full of feeling. For once, John Gay's songs sound as if they come from people rather than 'folk'.
