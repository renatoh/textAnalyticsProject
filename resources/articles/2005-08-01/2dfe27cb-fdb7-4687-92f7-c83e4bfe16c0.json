In Singapore last month, the former surgeon took several seconds after being given the envelope, tugging at it with great difficulty before he was able to open it. According to London 2012 bid leader Coe: \"The president explained to me the problem was that [IOC vice-president] Thomas Bach, who had sealed the envelope with typical German efficiency, had used elastoplast to seal it down. But I told him I never want another city to have to go through the agonising wait that we had to endure. \"[Mr Rogge] was pleased with the letter-opener and said that it would now be part of the official IOC kit which would be used when he opens the envelope in two years, to announce which city will host the 2014 Winter Olympics.\" The opener was specially manufactured in Coe's hometown of Sheffield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
