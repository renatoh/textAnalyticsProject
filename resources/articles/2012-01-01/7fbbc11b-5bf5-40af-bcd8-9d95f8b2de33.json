As part of the dizzying social media \"boot camp\" in which my guru Phil has been putting me through my digital paces, I am now on Google+ (or \"G Plus\" as Phil calls it). A step forward from Facebook, Phil explains, because you can draw people into different \"circles\". You can share photos with family but colleagues in your work \"circle\" won't see them. A great way, as Phil says, of managing your different audiences. \"You could,\" my friend Derek suggested unhelpfully, \"set up a circle for failed business coaches.\" For those of you who have been kind enough to connect/follow/friend me, it will come as no surprise to hear I am still struggling with this whole social media thing. Google+, however, I find completely baffling. Having set up my profile, I found I had put William Shatner and the Dalai Lama in my \"circle\" and can now read their \"stream\". The Dalai Lama is surprisingly active on G+. His Holiness's stream is full of profound thoughts for coaches to reflect upon. Speaking of coaches, I had a \"one-to-one\" earlier this week with Myles, whom I met at the Herts Coaching Club breakfast. It turns out he lives in the next street and was happy for me to drop by for coffee. He was on the phone when I arrived and ushered me into his conservatory. I was overawed by the sheer number of bird-feeders in his garden. I thought I was doing well with separate feeders for nuts and seeds but he must have had a dozen different types of bird food dangling from branches. \"Yes, of course,\" he said silkily on the phone. \"I've got your purchase order and I'll be booking the flights today.\" He paused and smiled. \"Likewise. It'll be a pleasure to work with you again.\" \"That,\" he said once he was off the phone, \"was a global manufacturing client. Doing some work for them in Dubai next month.\" I asked about the various feeders. \"Oh yes, we have nyjer seeds to attract goldfinch, sunflower hearts for siskin and pinched oatmeal for finches.\" I mentioned some of the unusual birds I see in the garden from my office and the conversation quickly became an ornithological arms race. \"We get goldcrest occasionally,\" said Myles smugly. At that point, I changed the subject having never once set eyes on a goldcrest in all my 50 years. \"Do you ever take on associates?\" I asked hopefully. Myles smiled weakly. \"I tend to work alone.\" I asked him for tips as to how to get started but I'm afraid Myles could only offer platitudes about how tough a market it is and how saturated with new coaches. I confess to being slightly despondent by the time I got back to my home office. I turned to my computer for a sign that my social media efforts were starting to flow through into more \"conversations\". Sure enough, there was a new email from Phil. \"Hi Geoffrey,\" it began. \"Please find attached my invoice for my social media coaching.\" \u2022 Follow Geoffrey on Twitter and Facebook, join his circle on Google+ and connect with him on LinkedIn"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
