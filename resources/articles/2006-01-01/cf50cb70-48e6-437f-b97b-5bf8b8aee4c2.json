Turk-ey. As those two syllables traipse off the tongue, what springs to mind? A fattened bird on the Christmas table, or an adjective that means duff, dud, no good? Not me. I think of Turkey the country; beautiful, unexpected and largely unexplored. Yes, unexplored. For while hundreds of thousands of Brits visit Turkey each year for a cheap 'n' cheerful package holiday - Benidorm without the tackiness or tits - most don't venture much further than the beachside bars. But, as we discovered during a 15-day, 2,500-mile road trip, there's another Turkey out there, where dramatic vistas and archaeological treasures spar furiously for your attention. Fire leaps from rocks. Landscapes look so alien you'd think you were on Mars. And tourists are greeted like old friends, not moneymaking opportunities. Other boxes were ticked too: we travelled with a company committed to responsible tourism, stayed in all manner of quirky places (including a converted cave) and - most importantly of all - had an absolute blast. Istanbul We started in Istanbul, a sprawling cosmopolitan behemoth that sweats history from every pore. Wherever you walk, you're never far from the guidebook eye-candy of the Byzantine or Ottoman eras, when Turkey's largest city was one of the greatest in the world. Istanbul's highlights are legion. The Hagia Sophia, built in the sixth century, is the fourth-biggest cathedral in the world behind St Peter's, St Paul's and the Duomo in Milan, all of which came on the scene centuries later. Its salmon-coloured exterior is stunning, as are the Byzantine mosaics inside. Just 100 yards away stands the 16th-century Blue Mosque, which stares down the Hagia Sofia with the confidence of a young pretender. The interior, accessible to non-Muslims outside prayer times, is interesting, but the mosque really shines at night, when lit up against the darkness like a lighthouse for believers. A short walk away lies another gem, the Topkapi Palace, the epicentre of the Ottoman Empire from 1465 to 1853. The palace, which makes Hampton Court look like a one-bed des res, houses many curiosities, including a supposedly authentic cast of the Prophet Mohammed's feet - at least a size 15 by my reckoning - and remarkable treasury. As you stare at the Sultan's opulent gold artifacts and weapons, most of them laden with hundreds of Opal Fruit-sized diamonds, one word screams at you: bling. You'll also find plenty of bling at the 15th-century Grand Bazaar, a sprawling covered market of over 4,500 shops that attracts around 250,000 people each day. There are genuine bargains to be had among the never-ending jewellers and hustlers selling fake Armani, but you'll need luck to find them. You're better off paying the bazaar a flying visit and moving on. Indeed, one of Istanbul's many pleasures is ambling aimlessly, chancing upon some hidden delight, and enjoying a drink with the swanky it-crowd in one of many chic cafes along the Bosporus strait. Turkey might be governed by a moderate Islamic party, but as you watch young lovers necking in the trendy Ortakoy district, it feels as liberal as anywhere else in Europe. The road trip properly begins... After a couple of days in Istanbul, we began our road trip proper by heading along the coast to Gallipoli, where thousands of Turks, Brits and Anzacs lost their lives in the bloody slaughter of the first world war. The Gallipoli museum is worth a quick visit, but it's only when touring the battlefield sites, landing zones and numerous graveyards that the horrors of history hit home. We spent some time at Lone Pine, now a memorial to the Anzacs who fought there, hand to hand, trench to trench. Reading the simple, stark messages left by loved ones on the gravestones, and the tender ages of the combatants, would bring a lump to anyone's throat. It did mine. After an afternoon in Gallipoli we were on the move again to Assos, an ancient hillside village visited by Aristotle and St Paul. There we watched the sun flit from gold to cranberry red as it illuminated the ancient ruins, before diving beneath the sea. That night we ate at Assos Borek House, a tiny restaurant where the owner grows all his vegetables organically in his back garden. More ruins and historical classics followed during the days ahead, the most impressive at Ephesus, once the largest city in Asia Minor. If you're a fan of all things Roman, you'll love trekking across the miles of dust and debris that make up this Unesco World Heritage site. But it does get pretty crowded and hot - enough, perhaps, to make you think that once you've seen one ancient site you've seen them all. Pamukkale, however, was spectacular. There are ruins, but its main attractions are the stunning cliffs, white as babies' teeth after centuries of being stained by calcium carbonate-rich water, and the ancient thermal baths. We ignored the latter because of the extortionate \u20ac16 entrance fee (although several hundred squidgy-bottomed Russians showed no such reluctance) and instead skipped barefooted down the cliff-face, admiring the wonderful views. Up the road from Pamukkale you can visit the house where Mary, mother of God, supposedly breathed her last. The place was packed with pilgrims - many of whom seemed to have a Texan drawl - but felt shabby and exploitative. We stayed 15 minutes before moving on. Beaches and more beauties During the early part of the trip, our group often spent six or seven hours on the road. It sounds hellishly long, but never felt like it: the surfaces were as smooth as a Lothario's pitter-patter and our excellent guide, Serkan, regularly stopped to show us an historical hotspot or for a delicious local speciality at an unassuming caf\u00e9. The landscapes also shifted by the day and the region: sometimes we breezed along the coast, a turquoise sea shimmering over our shoulders. On other occasions we went over dark mountains covered by wispy cloud, like Christmas puddings dressed in whipped cream. After nearly a week of exploring, it was time for the beach. First we enjoyed a couple of days kicking back in Kas - a lovely town that avoids the twin sins of overdevelopment and kiss-me-quick tawdriness that blight many coastal resorts - before heading up the road to the Cirali, where we stayed in wooden chalets on the sea at the Bellerofon hotel. Cirali, a protected wildlife area, is hippy-ish and laidback. We missed one of its big draws, the turtles nesting, but we did gaze in awe at the other: the chimaera - an almost mystical fire that creeps out from under the rocks and leaps three or four feet in the air. Amazingly, the process is entirely natural - the result of methane interacting with oxygen - but to anyone who saw it 2,000 years ago it must have appeared to be anything but. Star Wars From there we had a quick stopover at Konya, a grimy town with a museum dedicated to Rumi, but not much else. Even here, though, there were compensations, including a massage in a 13th century Turkish bath. Clad only in a loincloth, we were scrubbed from head to toe by a semi-naked man, before being washed and massaged in soapy water. It sounds a bit Christopher Biggins goes camping in Mykonos, but afterwards I felt fantastic. We stayed only a night before moving to Capadoccia, a stunning world heritage site of volcanic valleys, 3,000-year-old cave houses and sandstone formations that were the spit of rockets about to launch. It looks like Turkey's answer to the Grand Canyon, only weirder - indeed, some of the backdrops in Selime were used to depict Tatooine in the original Star Wars movie. We stayed three days in the G\u00f6reme Valley, in a converted cave hotel, exploring the stunning, sun-blushed landscapes and the 11th-century Byzantine churches. We also went to a whirling dervish ceremony, watching in awe as the Sufis spun dizzyingly around for 45 minutes, their eyes locked in dreamy devotion. Our final stop on the tour was Safranbolu, a town that looks like a middle-European fairytale with its Ottoman houses and cobbled streets. It was so far off the beaten track that we were mobbed by schoolboys asking us what football teams we supported, while girls giggled, waved and whispered to each other. For the briefest moment, we felt like rock stars. Safranbolu has a reputation for being one of the friendliest places in Turkey. Judging by the way we were treated in the guesthouse we stayed in, it's wholly deserved. Lasting memories Turkey is fascinating country. It straddles Asia and Europe, embraces democracy and Islam and is, by turns, both liberal and conservative. Sherry-cheeked academics might rage over the clash of civilisations, but Turkey is making a real fist of proving them wrong, despite the occasional wobble. And that's not all the country has to offer. Here, sun and sea tango effortlessly with culture and history; the people are welcoming, and a cost of a three-course meal is often cheaper than a skinny latte in an Islington caf\u00e9. And there's enough hidden gems to make even the most world-weary travel fashionista revel in the thrill of the new. With Turkey's economy booming, the country feels increasingly confident and outward looking. That confidence is reflected in the way the Turks pronounce their country name- \"Turk-i-ye!\", with a jaunty urgency to the last syllable. It's certainly no dud, at any rate.
