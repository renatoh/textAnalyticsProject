The journey was a blur of tears and terror, weeping for the city and friends she was leaving behind, frightened that the evacuation bus with a picture of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, stuck to the windscreen would be halted by government troops. \u201cIt was really terrifying, really sad,\u201d she said in a phone interview from Idlib province, where Sima, her mother, sister and a few other relatives are staying in rented rooms. \u201cI had lived in Aleppo since I was born \u2013 I didn\u2019t leave it even in the revolution or when it was besieged.\u201d A university student who came of age during the war, she also worked as a media activist, which would mark her out as a target if the uncertain guarantees given by the Syrian regime to those on the vehicles were broken. \u201cI felt like it\u2019s maybe a trick to capture us, but we had no choice \u2026 to them, I am a terrorist.\u201d The evacuation has been difficult and chaotic, with thousands of people streaming through the freezing, shattered streets of rebel-held Aleppo and trying to cram on to one of the few dozen buses provided for up to 50,000 people. Desperate to get out, huge crowds surged around the vehicles. \u201cWe had to wait about four hours to get on board,\u201d said 21-year-old Mohanned, who lost contact with his uncle, cousin and father in the crush. \u201cIt was so cold, the area was destroyed and the children were all crying. The Red Crescent teams were trying to organise everything, make sure the children and injured got on first, but there were too few buses. Everyone was desperate to get out.\u201d He found his father on one bus but their relatives are still missing. \u201cMy uncle and his son are still stuck inside Aleppo, we think; we have not been able to contact them. I don\u2019t know if they managed to get out or are still in the besieged areas.\u201d Communications from Aleppo are at their worst since the start of the war, with phone and internet coverage failing. Batteries are running low, as people trying to flee lose access to generators they usually use to recharge their phones. Fears that the evacuation might be a government trick, which made some wary of boarding the buses, have given way to fears that Assad and his allies may shut down the shaky ceasefire before all can leave. On Friday, the evacuations were halted after rebels linked to al-Qaida broke the ceasefire terms. There were also reports that troops loyal to Assad had stopped buses and killed or detained men on board. \u201cThousands waiting to be evacuated but the sectarian militants prevented us after they took all of our money and told us to go back,\u201d a journalist, Zouhir al-Shimale, tweeted after his bus returned to Aleppo. \u201cAfter this horrible day, which is the worst catastrophe day of my life \u2026 I will not leave without UN observation.\u201d The UN\u2019s children\u2019s agency, Unicef, warned there were still many children, whose lives are in immediate danger, among the crowds hoping for escape. \u201cHundreds of \u2026 vulnerable children, including orphans, remain trapped inside that part of the city,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s director, Anthony Lake. \u201cWe are extremely concerned about their fate. If these children are not evacuated urgently, they could die. \u201cUnicef and our partners are on standby to evacuate these children to safety. We implore all parties to the conflict to let us do so safely and immediately.\u201d Those who made it out are still in a war zone in midwinter, weakened by months without proper food or medical care. Few have been able to bring anything other than cash and some clothes with them. At the initial staging point of Khan al-Assal, a few miles outside Aleppo, buses and pickup trucks delivered those lucky enough to have escaped. Those with money took cars and buses to join friends and relatives further afield, but dozens of hungry children milled around asking for food and the injured waited for medical help amid the wail of ambulance sirens. It is an area still targeted by government and Russian bombs, although the attacks are much less intense than the bombing raids on east Aleppo in recent months. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from hell to the unknown and another hell to follow. They will send us to Idlib and kill us all,\u201d said Idris Rasool, an east Aleppo shopkeeper. \u201cAt least I can breathe without the smell of bombs. But it won\u2019t be for long. The regime and their masters, the Iranians, will hunt us down.\u201d Adding to their misery, there was the final humiliation of Assad\u2019s photo pasted on the evacuees\u2019 bus windows. \u201cI wanted to tear this picture apart,\u201d said Zain. \u201cIt was an awful feeling to feel a criminal looking at you and not be able to do anything.\u201d All the evacuees hope to return one day but fear that when they lost the battle, they also lost their homes. Assad, they say, will move in supporters to the areas that are still habitable or those he rebuilds. \u201cI left my heart behind; I left the house that I grew up in and the house that I lost my mother in. I spent my childhood there, happy and bad days,\u201d said Abu Ahmad, a 35-year-old aid worker from Saif al-Dawla. \u201cThe most difficult part is we left the city defeated and humiliated; I don\u2019t know tomorrow who will move to my house. My only hope is to go back to Aleppo one day.\u201d Some of the names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
