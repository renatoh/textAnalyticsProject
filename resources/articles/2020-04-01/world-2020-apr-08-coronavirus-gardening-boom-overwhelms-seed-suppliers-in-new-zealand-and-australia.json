New Zealanders are halfway through a strict four-week lockdown, in which they are not allowed to leave their homes except to buy essential supplies or to exercise locally. The restrictions are among the toughest in the world, but as a result, new cases of coronavirus have begun to decline. Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health, has repeatedly encouraged Kiwis to get exercise through \u201cgardening\u201d, and the advice has been taken to heart. King Seeds, the country\u2019s largest seed supplier, has temporarily suspended online ordering after experiencing 10 times its usual business. Many Kiwis appeared to be stockpiling seeds for summer, owner Gerard Martin said, or planting anything and everything out of panic, including watermelon, tomato and basil crops on the cusp of winter. \u201cThey [customers] are buying a lot more than they normally would and buying things that they don\u2019t need at this time of the year as well,\u201d Martin told Stuff. Egmont Seed company based in New Plymouth said there were would be \u201clarge delays\u201d on all of its orders, as demand for seed was \u201cunprecedented\u201d during the lockdown, with ordering spikes beginning on the first day of lockdown. \u201cThis time of year is normally our \u2018quiet\u2019 months,\u201d the company said on its website. \u201cWe are clearly not keeping up and clearly never will \u2026 PLEASE EXPECT DELAYS.\u201d In Australia, The Diggers Club, one of the country\u2019s largest gardening clubs and seed catalogues, paused new product orders due to \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d. The company said on its website that while it had \u201ca good supply \u2026 our priority is to reduce the extensive delays on existing orders\u201d. Eden Seeds, a popular heirloom seed supplier in Australia, has suspended orders until after Easter; while an email seen by Guardian Australia shows that Yates, a major supplier of seeds in both Australia and New Zealand, has been unable to deliver some current orders \u201cdue to unexpected demand\u201d. On its Australian website, Yates suspended all new orders saying \u201cwe have completely sold out\u201d. Bronwyn Alder, from the independent plant shop Newtown Garden Market, experienced a run on seeds first hand. \u201cIt\u2019s both the seeds and the edible seedlings,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the phone ringing off the hook for people interested in growing seeds for the first time. There\u2019s been so much new interest in gardening for edible plants. The amount of new gardeners who are interested in edibles is unparalleled.\u201d The market gets new stock at the beginning of every season, and they usually \u201chave a decent supply in\u201d. However, this year, \u201cwithin a week and a half we had no seeds on the rack. We\u2019ve been trying to order more, but our supply chain can\u2019t get any more in. They\u2019re struggling with the demand \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone was prepared.\u201d Alder does not believe her customers are hoarding seeds, however. \u201cI think there are some people who are feeling fearful \u2026 about food security, and have a genuine interesting in growing their own for food protection. And I think there are people who are bored and want a hobby.\u201d She added: \u201cThe silver lining to [the coronavirus crisis] may be that 2020 is the year people\u2019s gardens look great again.\u201d In New Zealand, seed companies said there was no shortage of supply and urged gardeners to buy normally, and only what they immediately intended to plant. Online, membership of gardening groups has boomed, with people sharing lockdown ideas for weaving weeds into baskets, planting strawberry seeds scooped out of shop-bought strawberries, and growing new roots for supermarket lettuces and leeks. \u201cPlanted on the very first day of lockdown we are now picking and eating mizuna and bok choy,\u201d wrote one woman on the New Zealand Budget Gardening page. \u201cSilverbeet is ready too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
