The sight of the Wycombe manager, Gareth Ainsworth, and his Southend counterpart, Phil Brown, holding hands and exchanging what the latter referred to as \u201cman hugs\u201d as their two sides slugged it out in the penalty shootout showed that, despite some reports to the contrary, football does still a heart. \u201cI made a big point of standing next to Phil and saying, \u2018I\u2019m not going to celebrate every penalty that goes in. I\u2019m not going to put that in your face\u2019. He agreed he wouldn\u2019t do that to me either,\u201d explained Ainsworth. \u201cWe had a moment of respect on the halfway line because for 120 minutes of the game, we were in charge and involved in every kick but penalties are always a lottery. Phil gets some stick from various places but I respect him and he\u2019s always been good to me.\u201d The feeling was clearly mutual. Brown\u2019s career in management is finally on the up again after a few years in the wilderness following his success in guiding Hull to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2008. Having endured a difficult year at Preston, the 55-year-old was out of work for almost 15 months until he replaced Paul Sturrock at Roots Hall in March 2013 and combined work as a radio summariser with appearances on the BBC quiz show Fighting Talk. But even in his moment of triumph at Wembley after seeing his excellent young goalkeeper Dan Bentley push Sam Wood\u2019s penalty \u2013 the 16th of a topsy-turvy shootout \u2013 onto the post to seal Southend\u2019s victory, Brown\u2019s first thought was for his opposite number. \u201cYou do lose that bit of dignity at times \u2013 it\u2019s almost a hatred for the opposition. So we agreed immediately to do that and that shows the class of the guy,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say managers and good guys don\u2019t go hand in hand. You\u2019ve got to be ruthless, you\u2019ve got to be horrible and make tough decisions. But you can do that and be a decent guy at the same time as long as you are honest and truthful to yourself and your players.\u201d Retaining key players such as Bentley, the midfielder Michael Timlin and the striker Barry Corr would mean there is no reason why Southend could not thrive at the higher level next season. Their manager\u2019s deal was due to expire at the end of next month but Brown insisted he never had any doubts his future remained in Essex, regardless of Saturday\u2019s result. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t want to be in the second division all my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got ambitions and those ambitions remain. I want to be back in the Premier League if I get a second stab at it. I\u2019m a lucky man. I\u2019ve managed four different clubs and there\u2019s a lot of young talent out there who only get one chance. But this is up there with my best achievements.\u201d For the impressive Ainsworth, there were only positives to be drawn from a heartbreaking defeat. The momentum from Wycombe\u2019s great escape from relegation on the final day of last season took them all the way to the play-off final and with their manager signed up for another four years, the future does look bright. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players on less money a week than what some of the tickets cost for the match so I\u2019m very proud of their efforts,\u201d said Ainsworth. \u201cWe wanted to bring the buzz back to the club and that\u2019s what we have done. We have a five-year plan to make this club sustainable in League One and we\u2019re way ahead of that already.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
