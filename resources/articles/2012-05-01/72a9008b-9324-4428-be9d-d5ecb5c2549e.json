How she fares against the defending Olympic champion Pamela Jelimo when the pair compete against each other in Ostrava on Friday night could provide some insight into her chances. The Kenyan has recorded the fastest 800m time in the world this year \u2013 1min 56.94sec \u2013 whereas the South African has so far struggled to get her season off to a positive start. Semenya, who left her coach Michael Seme last year to join up with the seven-times world champion over 800m, Maria Mutola, faces a strong field in Ostrava which includes Fantu Magiso of Ethiopia, who finished second behind Jelimo at the Doha Diamond League in 1:57.90, the second-fastest time of the season. \"I cannot wait for this race,\" said Semenya. \"I've been waiting for so long to run against her [Jelimo] \u2013 she's the best in the world.\" Mutola holds the Ostrava meeting record, a time of 1:57.7, but Semenya is confident that she can improve that time on Friday. \"Of course I have to follow the steps of my coach, I feel very positive. If we dip under 1:56 it's OK by me.\" Semenya says life has improved dramatically since the controversy over her gender that dogged her world title win in 2009. Changing coaches to work under her idol, Mutola, has been an important part of that. \"A lot of things have changed. In life, you need to explore; I just saw the opportunity and grabbed it. I met with Maria before the world champs and told her I want to change, I want something new in life. So far training is good. We started after the world champs. \"My relationship with my previous coach is good, there's no hard feelings, but I just have to improve. My goal is to win the Olympics and Maria's my role model, I just want to follow her steps \u2013 she's world champ and Olympic champ and I think everything is going well.\" The South African also believes that she has the ability to break the 800m world record, the longest standing women's world record in the sport, set by Jarmila Kratochvilov in 1983. \"It just needs hard work,\" said the 21-year-old. \"Sooner or later, we will smash it. I cannot wait for that \u2026 I had a long break after the world champs so if I hadn't had a long rest maybe I could have done it. After Berlin, maybe if I had had three races I could have done it. I was in good shape, I just needed more races.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
