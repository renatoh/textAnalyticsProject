Raices, a Texas-based group that provides legal services to immigrant and refugee families, rose to national prominence during the family separations that took place under the Trump administration\u2019s hardline \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy. A viral Facebook fundraiser raised more than $20m for the organization. \u201cPledging us a small portion of the money you make from CPB [sic] contracts will not distract us from your continuing support of this agency,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cWe will not be a beneficiary of your effort to buy your way out of ethical responsibility.\u201d Salesforce is one of several tech companies facing pressure from employees and customers to cancel contracts with the government agencies responsible for US immigration policy and enforcement. More than 650 Salesforce employees recently signed a petition addressed to the company\u2019s chief executive, Marc Benioff, asking him to \u201cre-examine\u201d contracts, announced in March, to help CBP \u201cmodernize its recruiting process, from hire to retire, and manage border activities and digital engagement with citizens\u201d. Benioff rejected the request, according to Bloomberg, but stated his opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, and the company pledged to donate $1m to groups helping those affected by the policy. A Salesforce spokesperson declined to comment on Raices\u2019s rejection of its donation on Thursday, pointing instead to two tweets from Benioff \u201cwhich reflect our current position\u201d. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about which organizations had received donations from Salesforce or whether the $250,000 donation to Raices would be offered to another group. It appears unlikely that the pressure on Salesforce will dissipate. On Tuesday, a group of 22 Salesforce customers, including Greenpeace International and the New York State Nurses Association, published an open letter to Benioff calling on him to drop the CBP contract. And on 9 July, a few dozen tech workers and local activists picketed Salesforce\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. Ryan wrote that Raices would be willing to accept Salesforce\u2019s donation if the company commited to ending its contract with CBP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
