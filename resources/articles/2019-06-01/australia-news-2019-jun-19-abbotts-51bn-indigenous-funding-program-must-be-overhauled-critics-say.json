The strategy was a huge shakeup in Aboriginal affairs funding introduced by the Abbott government in 2014, designed to \u201celiminate waste and duplication\u201d by consolidating more than a 120 economic, health, education and cultural programs under the prime minister\u2019s department. More than $500m was cut from Indigenous spending. A report released on Tuesday by the Australian national audit office said there had been \u201csubstantial delays\u201d evaluating the strategy, and for the first two years there had been no evaluation at all. The strategy was meant to offer funding flexibility, cut red tape and more clearly link funding to outcomes. However, in 2017 the national audit office found it was poorly implemented and not transparent. The department did not meet its guidelines, keep records of key decisions or set performance targets for all projects. The national audit office said the department was \u201cin the early stages\u201d of building an evaluation framework that \u201chas the potential\u201d to ensure it delivered high quality, ethical and inclusive outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Labor\u2019s Linda Burney said: \u201cThis is no way to manage billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money. Indigenous Australians deserve better, particularly when this year\u2019s Closing the Gap report showed five out of the seven targets are not on track. \u201cSerious questions about the administration of the [strategy]have been swirling for years.\u201d The Greens senator Rachel Siewert was \u201chorrified\u201d by the findings and \u201coutraged that it took two years for the government to even get an evaluation process up and running\u201d. \u201cBecause there is no evaluation, the government isn\u2019t able to say with certainty what has worked and what hasn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a serious change in approach, that is better directed, transparent and accountable.\u201d The chief executive of the national Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation, Pat Turner, said the report was \u201cnot good enough for the department in charge of the Australian public service\u201d. \u201cThis audit shows that it is time for a radical shift away from governments and public servants to Aboriginal-led delivery through their own community-controlled organisations,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will take responsibility for outcomes in a way that the public servants do not.\u201d She was pleased the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had agreed to a new Coag partnership agreement on Closing the Gap, which brings the representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples into the equation. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt will allow us to hold agencies much more to account for what they are doing and not doing,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBut we also have to commit to building up the community-controlled organisations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples to manage programs and deliver services to our people.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s department acknowledged the findings of the audit report but said the strategy was set up within a \u201cvery challenging timeframe\u201d. It was \u201cmoving into a more mature phase of implementation that draws on lessons learned\u201d. The report made four recommendations, which the department agreed to andwas already working to meet. It intended to revise the strategy\u2019s guidelines, and improve the application process and its own record keeping. The Indigenous Australians minister, Ken Wyatt, said he \u201cacknowledges the frustration we all share that we are not seeing quick enough progress on closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians\u201d. \u201cThis is why Coag has agreed governments \u2013 both commonwealth and states and territories \u2013 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will share ownership of and responsibility for a jointly agreed framework and targets and ongoing monitoring of the Closing the Gap agenda,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
