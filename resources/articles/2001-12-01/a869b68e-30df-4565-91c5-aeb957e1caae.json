Barring last-minute hitches, Patricia Hewitt, the trade and industry secretary, is expected to grant the export licence, even though there has been fierce and sustained opposition in government led by Clare Short, the international development secretary, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor. It was not clear last night whether Ms Short was aware that the decision to go ahead had been taken in principle. The forcing through of the contract is a public assertion of the power of Tony Blair, Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, and the defence secretary Geoff Hoon. Aware that there will be a storm of criticism from backbench Labour MPs and aid agencies, the government is preparing a detailed defence of its decision. The deal will be financed by a \u00a340m loan from Barclays Bank. The government is likely to argue that the Tanzanian air traffic control system, being supplied by BAE systems, will raise $3-5m annually for the heavily indebted country. Tanzania would be able to raise the money by charging traffic flying over its air space, something its current ramshackle system cannot permit. The system would also allow an increase in flights to Tanzania, so improving tourism and trade opportunities, according to the government. Ministers are also likely to argue that the International Monetary Fund has decreed that the Barclays loan is at concessionary rates and so will not endanger Tanzania's access to a \u00a32bn debt relief package. The status of the loan however is contested. Ministers are also planning to put pressure on BAE to lower the \u00a328m price tag. Government formally has no control over the commercially negotiated price, but ministers may have used their powers to deny the licence as a lever to cut the price. Some government members hope BAE understands the political sensitivity of the project and will make some gesture. They will also argue that the deal will safeguard 250 jobs at BAE Systems on the Isle of Wight. At Tuesday's heated cabinet committee meeting Ms Hewitt agreed and apparently led calls for sustainable development criteria to be written into the current export control bill. A new schedule will now be added to the bill which is due to have its second reading in the Lords next month. The change would mean export certificates would only be granted if the project was deemed to meet clear sustainable development criteria. The government in theory already takes sustainable development criteria into account, but the inclusion of a new schedule would strengthen Ms Short's hands in any future battles. If Ms Hewitt does press ahead, aid agencies are likely to dismiss her arguments and put pressure on Barclays to withdraw the loan. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, in a report commissioned by the World Bank, said the proposed system was four times too expensive and not adequate to improve the safety of civilian aircraft flying over Tanzania. At prime minister's questions Tony Blair hinted that there may not be grounds to block the licence, saying: \"We must follow the proper licensing conditions throughout and we will do so.\" He confirmed that Britain has written off \u00a3100m of Tanzania's debts. But Clare Short almost openly encouraged the growing backbench dissent. At international development questions, she told the Labour MP Glenda Jackson that she was grateful for all she had said after she claimed the go-ahead might diminish Britain's influence on debt relief. Barclays has provided the funding for the deal just below market rates, even though the Tanzanian government is not supposed to borrow on commercial terms because of its existing debt mountain. Britain and other donors recently wrote off $3bn of loans to Tanzania which it has been unable to repay. Barclays said in statement that the financing had been in place since 1999 and that it was \"not involved\" in the debate surrounding the sale. Justin Forsyth, policy director at Oxfam said: \"Barclays Bank should not be lending this money to a poor and debt-ridden country. It threatens to push Tanzania back into the mire of debt.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
