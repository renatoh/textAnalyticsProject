Mr Barroso was forced to disclose this week that he and his wife enjoyed a free two-week holiday on board one of Mr Latsis's yachts last August before he took office in November. The Greek tycoon is said to be a close personal friend since the two were at university in Geneva more than 20 years ago. The commission president has repeatedly declared that their links are purely private, raising no conflicts of interest between his personal life and public duties. Mr Barroso took over anti-trust cases concerning the cargo and liner industries after Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner, recused herself because of her former directorships in companies active in the sector. His spokeswoman insisted: \"The president is in charge of a number of dossiers from which Ms Kroes has recused herself and it is very clear that he will remain in charge, and as far as he is concerned there's no conflict of interest.\" Among the cases to be decided by Mr Barroso and his colleagues are two allowing consortiums of ship-owners active in the cargo and liner sectors to be exempt from EU rules on restrictive trade practices - provided they do not fix prices in a cartel. They are allowed to regulate capacity. Mr Barroso has been urged by the leader of the socialist group of MEPs, Martin Schulz, to explain the controversy in official talks with himself and leaders of the other 10 groups in the European parliament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
