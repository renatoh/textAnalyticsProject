In Muswell Hill (2012) he showed a disastrous dinner party from the perspective of the kitchen. His new play deals with the disintegration of a popular female TV chef but, while Betts is good on the gulf between public and private faces, a play that starts as social satire ends up improbably apocalyptic. We first see Betts\u2019s heroine, Caroline, rehearsing her TV show in her kitchen, but troubles, as Hamlet says, come not single spies but in battalions. Just for starters, Caroline has to deal with tabloid photos exposing her dead drunk, the long-delayed coming out of her socialist son and the revelation of her affair with a married builder. Betts shrewdly reminds us that fame offers no insulation against misfortune, but, as Caroline\u2019s life falls apart, so too does the play as it leads to a bewildering climax full of panic and violence. Having started with a specific target, Betts ends up tackling the explosion of the nuclear family and the decline and fall of the middle classes. Alastair Whatley\u2019s production is, however, strongly cast. As Caroline, Janie Dee easily convinces us she could be \u201cthe country\u2019s second favourite kitchen goddess\u201d while conveying the desperation of a devout believer appalled at her failure to live up to her principles. Genevieve Gaunt is very funny as her language-distorting PA; and there is strong support from Patrick Ryecart as Caroline\u2019s apoplectic husband and Jack Sandle as her invaluable handyman. The problem is that Betts seems torn between writing a comedy about celebrity chefs and demonstrating that the family is an outdated cultural construct. \u2022 Monogamy is at Park theatre, London, until 7 July.
