It\u2019s open for three hours, offering a brief window of help and respite for scores of local people who have fallen on hard times. Livia, 44, is a self-employed fitness trainer making her first visit to a food bank, accompanied by her daughter. Work is supposed to be the path out of poverty, but universal credit is stressing her out, an \u201cabsolute nightmare\u201d, and causing her to run up rent arrears. \u201cI put on a brave face but I\u2019m at rock bottom.\u201d As with many self-employed claimants, the vagaries of universal credit have proved demoralising for Livia. Although her business is new \u2013 and she had to have time off after a family bereavement \u2013 she is required to meet demanding monthly income targets and, if she does not make them, universal credit will not make up the difference. She said she has put a lot of work into getting the right qualifications and investing in equipment to get her business off the ground. But, with her monthly income now fluctuating between \u00a3600 and \u00a3200, she is thinking of quitting and getting \u201ca normal job\u201d. \u201cUniversal credit can discourage you when you are trying to better yourself.\u201d St Simon\u2019s is a branch of the Hammersmith and Fulham [H&amp;F] food bank, whose chief executive, Daphine Aikens, says people like Livia \u2013 resourceful, articulate, and working, but whose ability to keep the right side of the cost of living is increasingly precarious \u2013 are a growing presence there. The five-week wait for a first universal credit payment is a major cause of people needing donated food, says Aikens. Another is the benefit freeze, which has pegged the value of most working-age benefits well behind the rising cost of food and rent for more than three years. \u201cBenefits are simply not enough to live on.\u201d H&amp;F food bank was set up nine years ago, just as austerity was being rolled out, and its growth tracks a near decade of public spending cuts, welfare reform and growing inequality. Giving out food remains its expanding core purpose: four years ago, it distributed 4,400 three-day food parcels; in 2018-19 that rose to 11,706. Aikens is frustrated that the government ignores the impact of austerity and poverty, especially its profound long-term impact on a generation of children. She sees its pernicious effects, citing youngsters in a homeless family living in temporary accommodation who come to the food bank. \u201c[Those children\u2019s] lives have been turned upside down. There\u2019s no stability in their lives. Their clothes do not fit, they do not have toys or books. What are we creating for the future? How long will it take for the nation to recover from this lack of investment in the benefit system?\u201d Food bank user Emma, 46, a former estate agent, said she was a big fan of Margaret Thatcher. Back then, she said, \u201cif you was prepared to work you could thrive\u201d. Not now. \u201cThis time they [the Conservatives] are destroying everyone.\u201d For complicated personal reasons she is jobless but cannot claim benefits. She said that, unlike in her day, poverty seems to bite harder and opportunities are limited for working-class young people in this bit of London. \u201cKids I know have shoplifted underwear. They are stealing food they need to eat, and clothes to wear. They sell drugs so they have money to eat.\u201d Aaron Smith, 39, is at the food bank as he has been struggling since he lost his job as a hotel receptionist. He offers a detailed critique of universal credit, how in theory it works but collapses on contact with the messy complexity of real lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of the gap between the governing class and the people.\u201d In a busy vestry, volunteers make up food bags from tins, cereals, rice, pasta and cartons of juice donated by local people and supermarkets. There is also shampoo, sanitary towels, toilet roll, toothpaste, razors and washing-up liquid. By the end of the session, they have provided three-day emergency food parcels for 82 people. Volunteer Joanna King, 75, stops briefly to pass comment on the tragedy of food banks in a country as wealthy and supposedly civilised as Britain. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Jacob Rees-Mogg here,\u201d said King, referring to the Tory MP\u2019s comments describing food banks as \u201crather uplifting\u201d. King adds: \u201cHe should be ashamed of himself!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
