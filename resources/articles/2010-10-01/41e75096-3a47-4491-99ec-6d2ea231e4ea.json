The Irish government has got it wrong again, but the clue to why is not in the \"dozy government\" line. It is hidden in your quote that \"the elite directing the Irish economy is more tightly closed than an oyster shell\". Ireland operates like a one-party state and the government is just the political wing of that elite comprising developers, bankers and newspaper owners, with a whole network of vested interests descending into almost every corner of the Irish state and economic life. Of the \u20ac50bn of taxpayers money now committed to bail out the disastrous gamblers of the Irish banking system, nearly four-fifths of that sum is going into one bank, Anglo Irish. This bank has no high-street branches and so no claim to be part of the essential infrastructure of the country. And it is a bank which economic advisers have consistently told the government not to include in the blanket bank guarantee, because the scale and rottenness of its debt will surely bring the whole house of cards down. So why is the government so interested in this bank? There is absolutely no transparency. No minutes of key meetings, or of the workings of the National Asset Management Agency (Nama), which is managing bank debts for the government, have seen the light of day. In fact it is in the Nama legislation that its workings can't be disclosed and that staff who speak about their work will be subject to criminal proceedings. Neither will key ministers answer questions about any personal investments in this bank. Could it be that the majority of investors in Anglo Irish are the same elite who also control the government? Cock-up or conspiracy? Bev Cotton Clonakilty, Co Cork, Ireland \u2022 The story of care assistant Sarah (For a taste of what life after cuts will look like, visit Dublin, 1 October) should serve as a strong warning to those making decisions about what to cut in public expenditure. The report would have been read with trepidation by people with a learning disability, their families and carers in the UK, who are already feeling the effect of an underfunded system. Swingeing cuts to frontline services result in the inhuman neglect of people with a learning disability and leave families and carers at breaking point. This is all too reminiscent of a time when people with a learning disability were treated as second-class citizens and left in institutions. We can only hope this is not the reality we will face after the comprehensive spending review. Social care is a vital service to vulnerable adults, as crucial as doctors and nurses, and must be protected.
