The Manchester United midfielder came on as a substitute right towards the end to finish a sweeping move to a rapturous reception from the German fans. Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, another late substitute in what was in the end a comfortable victory, said his return would give the team even more confidence as they prepared to face Poland in the match likely to decide who will top their group. \u201cWhen you see the criticism he got, is he fit, is he old, is he too slow, or whatever, and then to score like this in an important game is amazing. It\u2019s good for the team because he\u2019s our captain and he\u2019s so important for us and it\u2019s good for him to have this confidence,\u201d said the Wolfsburg forward. \u201cHe\u2019s a great person. Mentally he\u2019s so strong. He knows what to do on the pitch and he\u2019s so calm. We\u2019ve seen it in the training sessions. He\u2019s been one and a half weeks with the team and class is permanent, you know.\u201d Joachim L\u00f6w said afterwards that Schweinsteiger remained the heartbeat of the side whether he started or not. After his comeback as a second-half substitute in a friendly against Hungary last week, Franz Beckenbauer said the midfielder looked happier \u201caway from the problems in Manchester\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to come from the Bundesliga into the Premier League. It\u2019s something different. It\u2019s not an easy way to play football and it was not easy for him when he came with the injuries,\u201d said Sch\u00fcrrle. \u201cIt was a hard year for him. When he\u2019s fit, when he\u2019s the leader he wants to be, he makes every team better.\u201d Germany\u2019s unlikely goalscorer Shkodran Mustafi, only playing because Mats Hummels was injured, warmed to the same theme. \u201cI\u2019m happy for him because it\u2019s not easy to come back from injury with a lot of people criticising you or saying you might not go to a tournament like this. It\u2019s not easy but I\u2019m happy for him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe comes in and demonstrates that he still has this mentality that he wants to fight and wants to give everything for the team and it\u2019s important for young players like me to have someone like this in the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
