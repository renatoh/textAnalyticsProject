That message was spelt out to the player and his agent during an hour-long discussion on Monday, when Martin O'Neill, the manager, and Randy Lerner, the chairman, told Milner how integral he is to the Villa team and how eager they are to keep him at the club in the long term. Villa have described the talks as positive although Milner left without agreeing to sign a new contract \u2013 he has two years remaining on his \u00a345,000-a-week deal \u2013 and his future remains unresolved as he boards the plane to South Africa today as part of Fabio Capello's 23-man England squad for the World Cup. Whether City will return with an improved bid before the finals get under way is uncertain but Villa have made it abundantly clear that the \u00a320m that was tabled a fortnight ago significantly undervalues a player who has gone on to become a permanent fixture in the England set-up since making his debut against Holland in August last year and who, at the age of 24, has time on his side to continue to improve. Aston Villa's position promises to put City's desire to sign Milner to the test. Brian Marwood, City's football administrator, has followed Milner's career with interest ever since he broke through at Leeds United as a 16-year-old and he is determined to bring the PFA Young Player of the Year to Eastlands this summer. Marwood worked closely with Milner during his previous employment at Nike and believes he has all the characteristics to be a major success at City. Yet there must come a point when even a club with City's extraordinary wealth question whether they are getting value for money. Milner, after all, cost Villa \u00a312m when he arrived from Newcastle United less than two years ago and it is only during the last season, when O'Neill moved him into a central role, that he has really caught the eye. The most likely scenario seems to be that a game of brinkmanship will develop, with City expected to try to tempt Villa with players as well as cash in exchange for Milner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
