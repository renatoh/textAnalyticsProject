The announcement came via Twitter four hours before the event. \"We wanted to surprise fans!\" the publishing company tweeted. But, by the Terminator star's 1:30pm appearance, a sizeable line around the corner of the bookstore and a large crowd across the street had already amassed. There were those on the line who got word of the signing through friends, like editor Zach West from Brooklyn who rushed over to meet his main inspiration for getting into fitness, \"Arnold has been my hero pretty much since I grew up on Commando and the Terminator movies.\" In the case of mother and daughter, Annika and Malin Lagarquist, they were getting it signed for Malin's brother, \"He had called [Annika] a million times,\" she said. \"[Schwarzenegger] is a bit of a role model for him.\" Passerbys' reactions varied when they heard the commotion was over Schwarzenegger \u2013 from a man on a bike who cheered \"Schwarzenegger!\", to a teen who sucked his teeth as he walked away. On the topic of former California governor's infidelities, those we spoke to weren't too preoccupied over it. West was disappointed in the actor, but still admires him, \"this man has conquered three different professions,\" he said \"I mean, its an amazing life.\" For Neil Douglas and Jennifer Lawson, a couple on their first trip to New York from Glasgow, who happened to bump into the signing by chance, were able to push it aside, \"you're only in New York once.\" Lawson said. David Reeves, the inventory manager at McNally Jackson, reported they sold out their entire stock of 150 copies. When asked if the event met expectations he said, \"they exceeded them. We would have ordered more if we knew we would have had this kind of turnout.\" He also added there were no incidents of protests, and those who came through were genuinely excited to meet Schwarzenegger. When asked what they would say to the former Mr Universe, Lawson deadpanned, \"I don't think we'll mention his illegitimate love child. We'll keep it strictly to being 'adoring fans'.\" As for whether there will be more surprise signings throughout the rest of the book tour, the publisher tweeted, \"Well, by virtue of it being a surprise we can't say one way or the other.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
