Robin Geffen, of Neptune Investment Management, says a successful bid should be pitched at about 200p - valuing the 60-strong store chain at \u00a3470m. HoF shares are changing hands at 124.5p and the potential buyer, Baugur, is said to be considering an indicative bid of 150p, which would value HoF at \u00a3352m. Mr Geffen is pressing his case with HoF's brokers and advisers and has requested a meeting with John Coleman, the chief executive, and David Adams, the finance director. He is also attempting to drum up support for management among other fund managers or demand a much higher bid. He said: \"I am very keen that other long-term shareholders stand up and be counted on this one.\" Mr Geffen said the \u00a313m annual dividend payout was key to a would-be buyer. \"That would finance around \u00a3300m of credit, which together with \u00a370m of excess property assets identified would purchase the company's entire outstanding share capital at the current price.\" He also believes there are further costs to be cut and that HoF's joint venture with British Land is worth at least an extra 30p a share. Mr Geffen, who speaks for 3.2% of the stock, said he feared Baugur would pick it up at a rock-bottom price and then \"do a Debenhams\". Referring to the return of the Debenhams chain to the market this month, he said: \"It was taken out at an inadequate price; they took out all the cash they had borrowed and now it has been vomited back to us at an excessive price.\" He said he had not wanted to sell when private equity buyers bought Debenhams three years ago and had refused to buy shares on its return. Mr Geffen said the City had low expectations of what House of Fraser might fetch because brokers did not follow the company closely enough. \"The City, on the stockbroking side, just hasn't bothered to do adequate research,\" he said. He said the department store group had long been wrongly regarded as a perennial underperformer: \"The City has kept on trying to call a profits warning on House of Fraser. It has been stalked by hedge funds trying to short them but every time the company has stepped up to the plate and delivered. It is not in anyone's interest to let this one go.\" Few City analysts have put a value on HoF. Eithne O'Leary, at Oriel Securities, suggested last night that the HoF management had \"already done much of what would be done in the private arena\" but the share price remained unexciting. Richard Ratner, of Seymour Pierce, says the company \"is difficult to value on a normal [venture capital]-type formula\" but estimates a 150p-160p take-out price. Mr Geffen said executives deserved more reward for HoF's turnaround. He fears Mr Coleman and Mr Adams will sign up to Baugur's plan to cash in. \"We need to incentivise the managers,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
