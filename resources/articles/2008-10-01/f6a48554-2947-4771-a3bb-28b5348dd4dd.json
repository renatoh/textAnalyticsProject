If talk shows and gab-fests say anything about where American society is, consider what the ABC morning girl-talk chat show says about this election, and by extension, the country. The View \u2013 starring news legend Barbara Walters, comedians Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar and Sherri Shepard and former reality television star Elisabeth Hasselbeck \u2013 has been on the air for 11 years now, with its share of controversy amid its typical daytime fare of gushing interviews with starlets and chats with authors. Indeed, The View has always been known for dipping into the issues of the moment - Barbara Walters makes sure of it. So did former cast member Rosie O'Donnell who would get into it with the conservatives until she left the show last year. What's striking to me about the programme now is how this election has suddenly created political shorthand that is accessible to everyone \u2013 not just those who wait until the evening to watch Hardball, or are addicted to Keith Olbermann or Rachel Maddow (guilty!) \u2013 in other words the MSNBC liberals or Fox News diehards. Take a recent exchange on The View, in an argument about Obama and Bill Ayers where Ms Hasselbeck, the former Survivor and only true Republican on the show, returned to insisting \u2013 Sarah Palin style \u2013 that Americans needed to know the truth about the relationship between Ayers and Obama \u2013 days after Obama had succinctly made his statements about Ayers in his final debate with McCain and pretty much everyone else had weighed in on the ridiculous idea of hanging Obama with the long-ago deeds of Ayers. (This wasn't the first time Hasselbeck clung to the McCain line on this smear; nor was it the most aggressive.) Walters tried to talk Hasselbeck down, pushing away the idea of guilt by association bringing up McCain's ability to avoid taint-by-association to the Keating Five scandal. To which Hasselbeck cut her off and forcefully maintained that one had nothing to do with the other because McCain was \"acquitted\" of all wrongdoing in the scandal. Sure, Elisabeth's point was infuriating. But since when is the average daytime television watcher on familiar with corruption scandals of the 1980s? And since when has there been such a crossover into politics themselves? The audience must be used to the strange hybrid this show has become \u2013 and the weird access these women have to penetrating questions and real discussion that somehow much of the rest of television news has lost. Back in September, when John McCain came on the show expecting some tea and sympathy, he was called a \"liar\" and asked to explain his positions on the separation between church and state, Roe versus Wade and announcing \"I approved this message,\" when the message was clearly an exaggeration. (In response, Sunday New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Joy Behar, a New York accented hard-talking comedian, \"The New Edward R Murrow\") When the Sarah Palin clothing story broke, Joy Behar was quoted in the New York Times coverage of the Neiman Marcus/Saks shopping spree fiasco, saying in language all viewers could relate to: \"I don't think Joe the Plumber wears Manolo Blahniks\". All the women noted Palin has not come on the show since her nomination, but the hosts also chided Biden and Obama for not returning to the show. Obama appeared during the primaries and Michelle Obama largely won over the audience when she appeared this summer. Some of this crossover into political advocacy treads a bit dangerously. This past weekend Elisabeth Hassselbeck, who was brought on the show in 2003 and is cheerfully anti-abortion and pro-McCain-Palin - spent the weekend stumping in Florida with Sarah Palin. She mocked the Obama campaign and advanced some of the same half-truths and weird elisions the campaign itself supports. When the women of The View fact check each other and smack down some of their wilder allegations, the show's increasingly political bent feels like a healthy mid-morning snack. But listening to Hasselbeck's smirking, preening and unadulterated posturing for Sarah Palin was embarrassing at best and mendacious at worst. But then there are rumors she wants a show on Fox. In which case the audition went very well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
