Opener Sunset's rush of angry chords is eerily similar to Spacemen classic Revolution. Where Spacemen 3 were Walkin' With Jesus, WNS frontman Daniel Henley can't stop himself dropping in a reference to \"me and the Devil, walkin' side by side\". At times, it all feels so fiendishly counterfeit that you expect a visit from the sonic police, but the drones and psychedelic melodies are impeccably well done, and at times sublime. No Place to Hide conjures up a particularly translucent, opiate clam, while (In Both) Dreams and Ecstasies edges into more glacial Fripp and Eno territory. Actual originality is hard to pin down, though the Krautrocky Fire in the Still Sea introduces the not so psychedelic sound of Swansea's seagulls."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
