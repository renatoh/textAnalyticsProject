He did not have to make a tackle all evening, nor wait underneath a high ball as the hooves of white-shirted figures pounded closer to him. England played the passing game they have adopted in the last year, even though they were getting held up in the tackle and either turned over or slowed down. It became movement for movement's sake, attacking defenders rather than space, while Ireland in contrast recognised when to kick or break, colour against monochrome. 2 Leaders are required England will be the better for blooding players this year, Tom Wood, Alex Corbisiero and Matt Banahan as a centre for three, but there are times when hardened warriors are needed. Lewis Moody, Andrew Sheridan and Mike Tindall were missed, while Steve Thompson and Jonny Wilkinson's impact from the bench came when the match had already been lost. There were times in the opening 20 minutes, as Ireland built momentum, when England did little other than debate decisions with the referee and the trickle of water from their dam turned into a flood. 3 England need to step it up physically England are bidding to become the first team to reach three successive World Cup finals. They have always been the team to worry the southern hemisphere powers because of their ability to grind out results come the knockout stage, as they showed in 2007 after looking anything but champions during the group stage. Is the current side capable of playing ugly, winning rugby? They came second to Ireland physically, Donncha O'Callaghan, Cian Healy and Paul O'Connell ripping and mauling while the home back row, led by Jamie Heaslip, outmuscled their opposite numbers, valiantly though James Haskell tried. With their scrum shaky and O'Connell's threat at the lineout influencing calls, England had little foundation and even less control. 4 Invention is a key virtue The statistics of the respective half-backs on Saturday were revealing. Ireland's ran and kicked more than their counterparts, while England's invariably passed and their midfield lacked the quick thinking of Brian O'Driscoll and Gordon D'Arcy. 5 There are still positions up for grabs Martin Johnson will have Courtney Lawes back for the summer, along with Sheridan, and Tom Croft will be fully fit. He lacks an experienced tighthead prop following Phil Vickery's retirement, a specialist openside flanker, although Haskell was one of the successes of the Six Nations, and a playmaker at inside-centre. D'Arcy and O'Driscoll were not afraid to pass and loop but Shontayne Hape and Banahan offered far less after releasing the ball. England changed a year ago when they started to play with their heads up and react to what was around them, but they need to move on again tactically and Toby Flood needs a foil at 12."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
