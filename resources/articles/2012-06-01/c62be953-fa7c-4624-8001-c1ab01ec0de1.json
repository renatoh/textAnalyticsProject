I get challenged to races every day. I met Mickey Rourke in a London club and we had a race in the street. I'll race the kids, but grown-up people need to get real. I am an athlete and a doctor. I have received lots of honorary awards, so my full official title is something like Dr The Honourable Ambassador Usain Saint Leo Bolt. I have tried to make my friends call me it, but nobody does. My father was my hero. He always worked so hard. People think I don't train hard, but I really do \u2013 and it's all because of him. My earliest memory is playing in my yard. I'd play cricket, football and basketball or just run around. As long as I was outside in the sun I was happy. Your environment definitely changes your personality. I am similar to my sister. We are relaxed because we grew up in the countryside [in Jamaica], but my brother is different because he grew up in Kingston. He likes to be cool. Talent is worthless without commitment. The first thing my coach Glen Mills ever said to me was: \"Everybody has talent \u2013 it's what you do with that talent that counts.\" I will always remember that. Jamaican people are very proud. Whatever we are doing, we always try to push ourselves. Whether we are running a race or working in a shop, we want to be number one. I think that is wonderful. Ladies all enjoy different things, so you have to understand their personality to get their mind going. If a lady needs me to be romantic I will be romantic. But I am more of a real man most of the time. Sleep is beautiful. I live with my brother Sadiki and my best friend NJ in Kingston, and my only house rule is: never wake me up early. I can't cook. I just know that vegetables are good for you. What I enjoy most about my house isn't the big TV or the swimming pool but the fruit trees in my garden. They remind me of my childhood. When I sit and stare at them I feel happy. I like to sit under trees. Snakes and spiders terrify me. That's why I don't go to Africa very often. I also used to believe in ghosts when I was a kid and I would get scared, but not any more. I am not proud of my toes. They are not very pretty. Other than my toes, I feel good about my body. My arms and my abs are particularly nice. Bob Marley is a legend. I have all his old albums, and he did a great job of bringing Jamaica to the world. His daughter Cedella designed Jamaica's Olympic kit, so his spirit will be with me this summer. I can be emotional. I cried at a movie last year \u2013 but don't tell anyone. I have always been young and fast, so the idea of being old feels weird. I do worry about it. My friend NJ is a couple of months older than me, so I will always be younger than him. That makes me feel better. Usain Bolt is launching the new Puma fragrance range. For details, go to puma.com/fragrances"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
