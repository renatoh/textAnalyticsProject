What other options are out there? We\u2019ve singled out 10 essential queer works that deserve a wider audience. Beauty For every inspirational coming-out story, there are several agonised staying-in ones. They\u2019re not as easy to watch, perhaps, but Oliver Hermanus\u2019s stark, searing drama about a married, middle-aged and terminally closeted Afrikaner man who becomes violently infatuated with his daughter\u2019s boyfriend is a rare and essential study of the inner rot cultivated by years of identity suppression \u2013 and a fierce critique of pervasively toxic South African masculinity. Deon Lotz\u2019s performance, tense and bristling with ill-fastened rage and internalised homophobia, is entirely extraordinary; for a complementary portrait of hidden gay identity in modern South Africa, follow it up with John Trengove\u2019s equally impressive, tough-minded The Wound. 52 Tuesdays A study of transgender identity that exposes a film like The Danish Girl for the perfumed, inauthentic travesty it is, Australian director Sophie Hyde\u2019s diary-style film sensitively portrays a transgender man\u2019s year-long transition through the eyes of his accepting but inquisitive 16-year-old daughter, with whom he has weekly visits while undergoing the change. As such, the relationships of both grown parent and adolescent child to their changing bodies \u2013 and more internal senses of self \u2013 are examined in rare parallel, while as the former, the remarkable performance of gender-nonconforming lead Del Herbert-Jane (initially attached to the project only as a gender diversity consultant) makes a compelling case for not \u201cciswashing\u201d the casting of such roles. Lianna Made in 1983, John Sayles\u2019s grainy, empathetic indie about a New Jersey housewife\u2019s sexual and personal awakening after having an affair with a female college professor holds up more robustly than you might expect, notwithstanding some dated stylistic trappings and uneven acting. There are few dramatic fireworks in this coming-out story, but that\u2019s partly the point \u2013 that perfectly unremarkable people in the suburbs can be LGBT too, and that some things change more than others when you realise this. A glittery rainbow road to fabulous self-discovery doesn\u2019t unroll before Lianna when she comes out and leaves her husband: independence and a job at a supermarket checkout are the rewards here, and that\u2019s enough. Michael Queer cinema existed in mostly coded form for the middle decades of film history, but go back to the silent era, and you may be surprised by the untempered LGBT sympathies of landmark films like Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s raucous, stereotype-challenging cross-dressing comedy I Don\u2019t Want to Be a Man, and this piercing tale of unrequited gay love and longtime companionship by Danish master of austerity Carl Theodor Dreyer. Alleged to have been inspired by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, its narrative of a celebrated painter, spurned by the male model he\u2019s fixated on, who discovers a more loyal love in his dying days is reserved in many senses, leaving largely implicit the matter of sexuality \u2013 but emotionally, it gets you right between the eyes. Nighthawks At a time when the British education system is saddled with debate over whether LGBT relationships should be taught in schools, Ron Peck\u2019s unassuming but lingering character study of a gay schoolteacher in 1970s London deserves reappraisal: in its most extraordinary scene, his students barrage him with jeering questions about his sexuality, only to be taken off guard when he responds with calm, informative candour. Elsewhere, it\u2019s a textured, authentic portrayal of everyday gay life in the big smoke, covering casual sex and the club scene \u2013 a pre-Grindr realm that nonetheless isn\u2019t entirely removed from today\u2019s reality \u2013 with the same frank, straightforward approach as its protagonist. Pariah If you haven\u2019t ever seen Dee Rees\u2019s 2011 breakthrough film, know that Meryl Streep is judging you. \u201cWhat about Adepero Odebye? What about Pariah?\u201d she memorably exclaimed in her Golden Globe acceptance speech for The Iron Lady, noting the unsung indie performances no less deserving of trophies than hers. Streep got the surname wrong \u2013 it\u2019s Oduye \u2013 but was otherwise completely on point. Rees\u2019s study of a teenage African American lesbian coming out in the face of her mother\u2019s vicious prejudice is not just a representational milestone in the coming-of-age genre, but a stirring, emotionally immediate experience on any terms \u2013 and yes, should have made Oduye a major star. Paris 05:59: Theo and Hugo In cinema\u2019s long history of hacky, hackneyed meet-cutes, there\u2019s never been one quite like the one that opens Paris 05:59: Theo and Hugo: an 18-minute orgy in a Paris men\u2019s sex club, soaked in crimson light, where the two hip, hot twentysomethings of the title connect amid a veritable spaghetti pile of thrusting body parts. If you expect Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau\u2019s film to continue in the vein of this aggressive opening salvo, however, you\u2019re in for a bittersweet surprise. As the strangers peel away from the club for a night of walking, talking and \u2013 here\u2019s where it gets a little less like a gay Before Sunset \u2013 panic at the sexual health clinic, what emerges is a fresh, striking snapshot of young gay love and sexuality in the antiretroviral era. Raging Sun, Raging Sky A lot of the films on this list have been chosen for their social and political resonance alongside their entertainment value, but I have to be honest about the core virtue of Julian Hernandez\u2019s 140-minute epic of desire and physicality: it\u2019s really, really, really hot. The third in a trilogy of sensual gay experimental films by the Mexican auteur \u2013 the other two, A Thousand Clouds of Peace and Broken Sky, are both well worth your while \u2013 is the most ravishing of the lot, tangling the restless earthly bodies and urges of young gay men with eerie spiritual challenges and complications. It\u2019s queer eroticism given quasi-mythic grandeur. Tomboy Cannes rightly swooned over C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s exquisite lesbian romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire last month, and it looks to be the film that finally seals the French director\u2019s status as an arthouse major. Hopefully, however, it will lead new converts to other highlights in Sciamma\u2019s wonderful, probingly queer filmography \u2013 notably this perfectly pitched examination of childhood gender confusion, following a 10-year-old girl, Laure, who adjusts to her new neighbourhood by presenting as a boy to other, unquestioning children. Tackling Laure\u2019s duality with delicate psychological nuance and perceptiveness, Tomboy draws no firm conclusions about her identity, instead making the case for children to explore their gender without pressure or judgment. The Watermelon Woman As the first feature film ever to be directed by a black lesbian \u2013 how remarkable that it took until 1996 to reach that milestone \u2013 Cheryl Dunye\u2019s debut would have an immovable place in queer film history even if it weren\u2019t as lively, limber and funny as it is. A freewheeling romantic comedy that serves as the basis for both introspective self-portraiture and a pointed lesson in black film history, it stars Dunye herself as \u201cCheryl\u201d, a video-store worker and aspiring film-maker balancing an up-and-down love life with her research into black female stereotypes on screen \u2013 hence that caustic provocation of a title. Much championed by cinephiles and academics, but rarely screened or discussed in the mainstream, it deserves a brighter spotlight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
