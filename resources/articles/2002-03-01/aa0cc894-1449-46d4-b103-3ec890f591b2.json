What 55,000 people will remember when they think of the Champion Hurdle in 2002 is Istabraq, three times a winner of the race, being pulled up with a circuit to run, and the ringing applause that followed. Then they will remember Valiramix, and the clip of heels that cost him his life when victory seemed there for the taking. There were two flights left to jump when Valiramix came down, but he had flown the previous six and Tony McCoy still had a fresh horse tugging at his arms. On the other side of the track, Istabraq was slowly walking back to the stands and into retirement. All McCoy needed to do was let out an inch or two of rein and Valiramix would surely surge clear. He never got the chance. The field was at full speed after freewheeling down the hill when one of Valiramix's forelegs clipped the heel of Ansar. It was a galloping fall, 30 miles an hour to nothing in an instant, the sort few horses survive unscathed. At first there were hopes he might be saved, but two hours later it was confirmed that he had fractured a shoulder. The vets' only option was to put him down. The news that Valiramix had not survived served to emphasise that Charlie Swan had done the right thing when he pulled Istabraq up so early in the race, after only two hurdles. \"His action just went after the first,\" Swan said. \"I thought it might come back, but it didn't. If I'd gone on and something had happened, I'd never have forgiven myself. When you see something happen like happened to Valiramix . . . \" JP McManus, Istabraq's owner, agreed. He had a simple message for Swan as he climbed off Istabraq. \"Well done,\" he said, as he hugged his jockey. One final victory proved far beyond him, but Istabraq did at least go out as a favourite. More than \u00a3m in bets forced his starting price down to 2-1, ahead of Valiramix at 3-1, and within a minute every penny of it was profit for the bookies. Yet still the applause that washed through the enclosures was loud and warm, as he slowed to a canter and then to a walk. \"There was never going to be any risk with him, and if Charlie was in any doubt he was always going to pull him up,\" said Aidan O'Brien, Istabraq's trainer. \"I don't think we'll ever see another hurdler like him, with his enthusiasm, the way he used to jump, the way he used to cruise.\" Hors La Loi III is not in the same league as Istabraq, and though he won the opening race at the Festival three years ago, for most of last season he seemed to have lost any interest in racing at all. But there was no hint of that as he swept past Geos after jumping the second last and galloped on strongly all the way to the line. Marble Arch, a 25-1 outsider, was three lengths behind in second, and Bilboa, from France, another half-length away in third. Hors La Loi III's stablemates at James Fanshawe's yard in Newmarket are almost exclusively Flat horses, but this was still Fanshawe's second victory in the Champion Hurdle after Royal Gait's success 10 years ago. \"To have a high-class horse, either on the Flat or over jumps, is fantastic,\" he said, \"but you never quite get the cheer you get at Cheltenham anywhere else.\" For Dean Gallagher, the winning jockey, this was a piece of the big time that once seemed unthinkable. Four years ago he was still on police bail after being arrested during an investigation into alleged race-fixing and doping. He was released without charge, but then last year was banned from riding for six months after testing positive for cocaine in France. Gallagher was in tears as they led him back. \"Everybody in racing has been a great support to me,\" he said. \"Trainers like James and Paul Webber kept their faith. It's been hard - I'd be lying if I said it had been easy - but days like this make everything worthwhile.\" Gallagher's salvation as the demons closed in was his contract to ride for Paul Green, Hors La Loi III's owner. \"Dean never lost faith in this horse and believed he could win,\" Green said. \"Last year he would look out of his box - he just wasn't a happy horse. But he is back to his best again and I'm thrilled. \"Dean trusted the horse to the ultimate and that was the way he rode him. I'm terribly sorry about Istabraq and Valiramix, but we have all had our share of bad luck in this game and I'm a realist.\" For McCoy and Martin Pipe, Valiramix's trainer, there was only despair. Two years ago they lost Gloria Victis in the Gold Cup, barely 100 yards from the spot where their dark grey hurdler fell yesterday. McCoy has said that that was the lowest moment of his career. Now he has another to match it. Cheltenham yesterday put on show a new champion, an old champion and a champion who should have been, and all of them demand to be remembered. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
