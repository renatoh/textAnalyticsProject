Part ballet, part installation, it creates a radical alchemy between movement and light. And, as with all of McGregor's best projects, it makes things happen on the dance stage that we've never seen before. The curtain opens on a luminous, indigo-coloured world. Flashing LED numbers float and flicker while softly moving dancers appear and disappear. With the attenuating lines of Kaija Saariaho's cello concerto threading like currents through the atmosphere, the work inhabits a dimension where time and ambition are suspended. During the following sections, the action turns more sharply human. Bars of coloured neon light create an urban platform upon which McGregor's choreography revs to a bravura display of whittling fast pirouettes and pas de deux. But then light is sucked from stage, except for the shafts of brightness that illuminate the remaining dancers, Sarah Lamb and Eric Underwood. This is the strange, dark heart of the ballet, as they dance a duet of unearthly beauty \u2013 her body fusing with his as if sharing a single mind. Its trance-like, inward state makes the ballet's climax more moving and theatrically shocking. Suddenly, the back wall is lit with blue numbers, inexorably, blindingly counting time. As the dancers walk toward it one by one, they are extinguished from view. McGregor's futuristic aesthetic doesn't date the enduring modernism of Balanchine's 1957 piece Agon, but it makes Glen Tetley's Sphinx, from 1977, look entirely retro. This mythological love triangle \u2013 late Martha Graham with a veneer of glam rock \u2013 feels like an oddly regressive addition to the Royal's rep. But it is clearly fun for the dancers, who launch themselves into its sexed-up manoeuvres with style. In rep until 18 November.
