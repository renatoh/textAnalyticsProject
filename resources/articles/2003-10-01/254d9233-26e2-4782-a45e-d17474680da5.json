With actor Joan Collins and Sir David Frost among the 100 guest passengers, the supersonic plane touched down in London just past 4pm BST. Two other Concordes also landed at Heathrow - one from Edinburgh, with competition winners on board, and another with invited guests who had taken a trip from Heathrow out into the Atlantic and back. The final transatlantic flight left New York just after 1230 BST (7.30am local time) with Concorde's chief pilot, Captain Mike Bannister, 54, at the controls. BA chairman Lord Marshall was to be on board the flight, which was to inlcude a special champagne breakfast menu including Scottish smoked salmon with caviar and lobster fishcakes with Bloody Mary relish and wilted spinach. Champagnes on offer were to include Pol Roger Cuvee Sir Winston Churchill 1986, Alfred Gratien Cuvee Paradis and Pol Roger Vintage 1996 Brut Rose. Despite the early hour, New Yorkers gave Concorde a rousing send off. At Heathrow, airport operator BAA had erected a 1,000-seat grandstand for spectators but the company, together with police and Highways Agency staff, warned other would-be spectators to stay away from the Heathrow area and to watch from other positions, or see the final landings on television. In New York, Lord Marshall said: \"Concorde is a wonderful aircraft and her last day is one of mixed emotions. Everyone has enormous pride in all that she has achieved but there is inevitable sadness that we have to move on and say farewell.\" \"Concorde's magic has attracted millions of loyal fans who enjoy her unique blend of speed, grace and beauty. The decision to retire Concorde was a tough one, but it is the right thing to do at the right time. Concorde will always be part of BA and will hold a special place in the hearts of our staff and customers around the world,\" he added. Today's final flights bring to an end a supersonic story that began in 1956 when Britain and France began working separately on an aircraft that would fly at twice the speed of sound. The two countries decided in 1962 to work jointly on the project but as the original cost ballooned, the \"deadline\" for the first passenger flight slipped alarmingly. The first flying test of Concorde was completed successfully in 1969 but it was not until January 21 1976 that passenger services began, with BA flying from Heathrow to Bahrain and Air France taking Concorde form Paris to Rio de Janeiro. The last three Concordes to land today were being taken to join two other BA Concordes at a hangar at Heathrow where there will be a party tonight for BA's Concorde staff. A series of serious setbacks for the supersonic aircraft began in July 2000 when an Air France Concorde crashed just outside Paris with the loss of all 109 people on board as well as four people on the ground. Both Air France and BA grounded their Concorde fleets and spent millions of pounds in modifications to ensure the events which led to the crash could not happen again. By the time the aircraft were back in service in November 2001, the devastating effects of the September 11 terrorist outrages had led to a huge downturn in transatlantic travel. BA had hoped to resume twice-daily London to New York services on Concorde but only ever ran one a day after the restart. Even without the Paris crash and the September 11 attacks, both airlines were struggling with the effects of the American economic downturn. The high cost of Concorde maintenance was also making the business financially unfeasible. Air France had five Concordes remaining after the crash, while BA had seven, although only five flew once services resumed in November 2001. BA will be making an announcement soon about what will happen to its seven Concordes. It is believed one will go to Filton, in Bristol, where the former British Aircraft Corporation (now Airbus UK) manufactured the aircraft, while another could go to Manchester airport. Another Concorde could end up at the Seattle Museum of Flight in Washington state and a fourth may be presented to the USS Intrepid - an aircraft carrier based on the Hudson River in New York. Other possible homes which BA has considered include Duxford Imperial War Museum in Cambridgeshire and the Spitfire and Hurricane Memorial Museum in Manston, Kent. There is also a possibility that one Concorde could be kept flying, perhaps to be used for fly-pasts and air shows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
