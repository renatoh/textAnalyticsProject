Changes outlined by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) would bring assessment of GCSEs more in line with A-levels, which have been modular since 2000. Pupils would be able to complete up to half their GCSEs before the end of their two-year courses and have the option of resitting individual modules or units to improve their marks. More than 600,000 teenagers will get their GCSE results on Thursday but repeated challenges to the exam over the past 20 years have prompted a revamp. The changes in structure would coincide with plans to limit coursework and ensure it is done under supervision following fears over plagiarism. Questions to stretch brighter pupils are also promised when revamped arrangements for most subjects are introduced in 2009. Some GCSEs in English, maths and science already offer candidates a modular route but the QCA said yesterday that more could go the same way. \"It is quite possible we will see an increase in unitisation of GCSE,\" said a spokeswoman. \"It is a subject by subject consultation. It is not going to be a blanket rule that will fit all.\" Consultation documents from the authority say it wants to maintain standards, but unitisation \"can increase flexibility and choice\". However it adds that it wants 50% of assessment to be at the end of the course to ensure that it does not become \"fragmented and atomised\". End of unit exams would only be able to be retaken once. The changes in A-levels are thought to have contributed to rapid rises in pass rates and A grades, which topped 25% for the first time last week. This is because teenagers can discover in the first year of two-year exams whether they are really going to challenge for top grades and opt out if they are not. This leaves stronger candidates to complete the exams. Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said: \"The breaking up of the course can mean that pupils may not have an integrated understanding of the subject. Modularising the GCSE is likely to increase overall results. This is partly because it will be easier for the individuals to perform at a higher level through the restructuring of the exam.\" He added: \"The retaking of units - even once - introduces an element of unfairness.\" Concerns over GCSEs have already prompted many fee-paying schools to take the more traditional International GCSE, with one in three thought to be entering pupils in at least one subject, because they see it as a better preparation for A-levels. Geoff Lucas, secretary of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, said modular A-levels had made things easier for students. \"I think the experience from A-levels ought to be heeded.\" But the government does not recognise the IGCSE as part of the official exam system, so state schools would be reluctant to even consider it. It is not included in official league tables of schools either, angering those private schools that offer it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
