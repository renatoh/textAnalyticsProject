It turns out, as you would expect from a writer of Phillips\u2019 calibre, to be a work of real substance and even if, at three hours length, the drama is slow-burning, it eventually catches fire. Phillips\u2019 theme is the dilemma of an immigrant family caught between two cultures: cut off from their Caribbean past, they are confronted by the rank hostility of 80s Britain. In the overlong first half we watch Vivian, a hard-worked teacher, coping with a demanding neighbour and the knowledge that her revolutionary 21-year-old son, Errol, has impregnated his white girlfriend. Although Vivian describes her own early experience of ingrained bigotry in a heartrending monologue, it is in the second half that the story fully explodes. When the elder son, Alvin, returns from attending his grandfather\u2019s Caribbean funeral, we begin to grasp Phillips\u2019 point: that the family\u2019s past is not only shrouded in secrets and lies but that they symbolise a generation cut off from its roots while feeling like strangers in an inhospitable land. Aside from the fact that the in-the-round staging renders a crucial piece of climactic action invisible to a section of the audience, Nancy Medina\u2019s production is full of heat and fury and signally well acted. Rakie Ayola endows Vivian with the despair of a modern Mother Courage who, dedicated to surviving difficult times, finds she has lost the love of her sons. As the warring siblings, Jonathan Ajayi as Errol brings out the sexual chauvinism of the political radical and Tok Stephens as Alvin simmers with rage at maternal mendacity. Tilly Steele as Errol\u2019s brutally treated girlfriend and Debra Michaels as a widowed neighbour provide strong support in a complex evening. We expect plays today to be brisker and shorter, but Phillips\u2019 portrait of a family divided against itself and alienated from the surrounding society still rings disquietingly true. \u2022 At Bush theatre, London, until 27 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
