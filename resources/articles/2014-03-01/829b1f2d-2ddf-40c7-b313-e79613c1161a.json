We are pausing our live coverage here and will post a link to our latest live page when it is available. \u2022 Confusion surrounds a theory advanced by Malaysian military authorities that the plane might have turned back. There is doubt about how far it could have went if it followed that course, after General Rodzali Daud said the plane flew back out into the Malacca strait. Tengku Sariffuddin Tengku Ahmad, spokesman for the prime minister\u2019s office, contradicted that account in an interview with The New York Times. Tengku Sariffuddin said: \u201cAs far as they know, except for the air turn-back, there is no new development.\u201d Agence France-Presse has a useful graphic of the expanded search area. \u2022 Interpol chief Ronald Noble said the two Iranian passengers traveling with stolen passports \u201cwere probably not terrorists,\u201d downplaying early speculation that the disappearance is terrorist related. Interpol\u2019s National Central Bureau in Tehran confirmed the identities of the two men as Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, and Pouria Nourmohammadi,18. \u201cThe more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident,\u201d Noble said. \u2022 Malaysian investigators said they are looking into the psychological background of the missing plane\u2019s 12 crew members. \u201cWe are looking into four areas: one, hijacking, two sabotage, three psychological problems of the passengers and crew and four personal problems among the passengers and crew,\u201d said Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar. \u2022 Aviation experts criticized the way Malaysian authorities have helped fuel what is likely to be misleading speculation. \u201cIn my opinion terrorism and pilot suicide are very remote and far fetched,\u201d said lawyer Steve Marks, who represented relatives of victims in two plane crashes. \u201cIt can\u2019t be ruled out 100% but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be the focus. That kind of speculation without proof is very damaging and hurtful to the families.\u201d Malaysia airlines has said it is \u201ctaking seriously\u201d reports by a South African woman who said the co-pilot of the missing plane had invited her and a female companion to sit in the cockpit during a flight two years ago, according to the Associated Press. The AP reports a statement by the airline: Malaysia Airlines has become aware of the allegations being made against First Officer Fariq Ab Hamid which we take very seriously. We are shocked by these allegations. We have not been able to confirm the validity of the pictures and videos of the alleged incident. The woman, Jonti Roos, said in an interview with Australia\u2019s Channel Nine TV that she and her friend were invited to fly in the cockpit by Hamid and the pilot between Phuket, Thailand, and Kuala Lumpur in December 2011. The TV channel showed pictures of the four apparently in a plane\u2019s cockpit. There\u2019s considerable confusion around the theory that flight MH370 veered back towards Malaysia after it stopped communicating with ground controllers. The Malaysian air force chief, General Rodzali Daud, has been quoted as saying that the flight made a sharp left turn, and headed back across Malaysia and out over the Malacca strait. The New York Times quotes Tengku Sariffuddin Tengku Ahmad, spokesman for the prime minister\u2019s office, as contradicting that account. He said that senior military officials, with whom he had checked, said there was no no evidence that the plane had crossed back over the Malaysian peninsula, only that it may have attempted to do so. \u201cAs far as they know, except for the air turn-back, there is no new development,\u201d Mr Tengku Sariffuddin is quoted as saying. The Times says he described the earlier remarks by the air force chief as \u201cnot true.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Matthew Weaver spoke to aviation experts earlier today. The experts criticized the way Malaysian authorities are fueling what is likely to be misleading speculation about what caused the plane to go missing. Steve Marks, a lawyer at the US firm Podhurst Orseck, which represented relatives of victims of a SilkAir crash in Asia in 1997 and the Air France crash in 2009, said he was suspicious of information being released by Malaysia. On Tuesday Malaysian investigators said they were still looking at a range of theories including hijacking and possible sabotage by a passenger or crew member. Marks said: \u201cIn my opinion terrorism and pilot suicide are very remote and farfetched. It can\u2019t be ruled out 100% but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be the focus. That kind of speculation without proof is very damaging and hurtful to the families.\u201d Marks thinks the most likely explanation for the plane\u2019s disappearance was a sudden technical failure. \u201cIt is not uncommon in plane crashes over water to have a very extended search,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is so mysterious here is the complete absence of any information, which to me tends to support a complete catastrophic failure at altitude. If the aircraft had come under control it would have been picked up by some radar, or some radio communication. \u201cThe complete absence of any information suggests there was a big failure and it was very sudden.\u201d Iranian authorities confirmed the identities of the two men traveling with stolen passports on flight MH 370 as Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, and Pouria Nourmohammadi,18. Interpol previously reported Nourmohammadi\u2019s age as 19. Interpol chief Ronald Noble said in a statement that its National Central Bureau in Tehran confirmed the two Iranian nationals used authentic passports to travel to Kuala Lumpur. The two men then used stolen Austrian and Italian passports to board the now missing Malaysian Airlines flight. \u201cNCB Tehran has also confirmed that neither of the men had a criminal record and both left Iran legally, and we are now calling on the public\u2019s assistance in providing additional information about their movements,\u201d Noble said in a statement. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak has attended a 90 minute briefing on the continuing search operation. Relatives of Chinese passengers on board missing the flight have refused to accept money from Malaysia Airlines as distrust and frustration at the carrier mounted, AFP reports. The airline said it had offered \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d of 31,000 yuan (\u00a33,040) to the family of each missing traveller. But a relative of one of the passengers, from east China\u2019s Shandong province, told AFP: \u201cWe\u2019re not really interested in the money.\u201d \u201cIt is all about the people - the people on the plane. We just want them back,\u201d she said at the Beijing hotel where relatives and friends of many of the 153 Chinese passengers - more than two-thirds of those on board MH370 - were waiting anxiously for news. Ignatius Ong, leader of the Malaysia Airlines response team in China, confirmed that the offer had not been taken up. But he denied the relatives had rejected it, saying they had asked the airline to \u201creview\u201d the terms of the acceptance form. \u201cThere are certain items where there will be a difference of opinion,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are very difficult times and we also appreciate that at this time a lot of people are frustrated.\u201d Relatives have endured days of anxious waiting under an intense media spotlight and some appeared to begin to accept that their loved ones may not have survived. \u201cWe are mentally prepared for the worst,\u201d said one relative, who told AFP that her husband\u2019s brother had been on board as part of a group accompanying Chinese artists to an exhibition in Malaysia. \u201cWe feel really helpless and haven\u2019t been to sleep for days as we are very worried,\u201d she added. Four days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing with 239 people on board here\u2019s where things currently stand: The Malaysian military is focusing its search for the missing plane on the Malacca Straits after information that it changed course after vanishing from traffic control screens. The search operation has been intensified with more ships and aircraft involved, but there have been no confirmed sightings of debris. Malaysian investigators are turning their attention to the psychological background of the passengers and 12 crew members on board the missing plane. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said: \u201cWe are looking into four areas: one, hikacking, two sabotage, three psychological problems of the passengers and crew and four personal problems among the passengers and crew.\u201d The Malaysian government remain baffled by the plane\u2019s disappearance. Malaysia\u2019s defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein tweeted: \u201cHave we missed anything?\u201d Interpol has played down speculation that the disappearance of the plane was terrorist related after it released images and the identities of two Iranians who boarded the plane on stolen passports. Secretary General Ronald Noble told reporters: \u201cThe more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident.\u201d The Iranians who boarded the flight on stolen passports were named by Interpol as 19-year-old Pouri Nour Mohammadi and 29-year-old Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza. The Malaysian authorities said the younger man was travelling to Germany to seek asylum. The Malaysian military believes the missing plane flew for more than an hour after vanishing from air traffic control screens, changing course and travelling west over the Strait of Malacca, a senior military source told Reuters. Malaysian authorities have previously said flight MH370 disappeared about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur for the Chinese capital Beijing. At the time it was roughly midway between Malaysia\u2019s east coast town of Kota Bharu and the southern tip of Vietnam, flying at 35,000 ft. \u201cIt changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude. It made it into the Malacca Strait,\u201d the military official, who has been briefed on investigations, told Reuters. The Strait of Malacca, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping channels, runs along Malaysia\u2019s west coast. Earlier on Tuesday, Malaysia\u2019s Berita Harian newspaper quoted air force chief Rodzali Daud as saying the Malaysia Airlines plane was last detected by military radar at 2:40 a.m. on Saturday, near the island of Pulau Perak at the northern end of the Strait of Malacca. It was flying at a height of about 9,000 metres (29,500 ft), he was quoted as saying. A non-military source familiar with the investigations said the report was being checked. \u201cThis report is being investigated by the DCA (Department of Civil Aviation) and the search and rescue team,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere are a lot of such reports.\u201d The time given by Rodzali was an hour and 10 minutes after the plane vanished from air traffic control screens over Igari waypoint, midway between Malaysia and Vietnam. There was no word on what happened to the plane thereafter. If the reports from the military are verified, it would mean the plane was able to maintain a cruising altitude and flew for about 500 km (350 miles) with its transponder and other tracking systems apparently switched off. Malaysia has extended the massive search operation for the plane to the Malacca Strait after initially focusing on the South China Sea. As the Malaysian authorities probe the psychological background of the crew and passengers, the Australian media reports that the co-pilot on the missing flight had a lax attitude to security. Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun has published photographs of Fariq Abdul Hamid posing with tourists in the cockpit on a previous international flight. It reports: In a worrying lapse of security, it\u2019s been revealed pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid and his colleague broke Malaysia Airline rules when they invited passengers Jonti Roos and Jaan Maree to join them in the cabin for the one-hour flight from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur. Ms Roos, who is travelling around Australia, told A Current Affair she and Ms Maree posed for pictures with the pilots, who smoked cigarettes during the midair rendez-vous. \u201cThroughout the entire flight they were talking to us and they were actually smoking throughout the flight which I don\u2019t think they\u2019re allowed to do,\u201d Ms Roos said. Interpol released a new image of the two Iranians travelling on the stolen passports. The bearded man at the front is Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza who is believed to have used a stolen passport that had belonged to Italian Luigi Maraldi. The man at the rear is 19-year-old Pouri Nour Mohammadi, named by Malaysian authorities as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, who is believed to have boarded the missing jet on a stolen passport that had belong to 61-year-old Austrian Christian Kozel. Noble also said that Interpol believes that no other suspect passports were used to board the plane apart from the ones used by the two Iranians. Noble played down speculation that the two Iranians were terrorists. \u201cThere has been great speculation about whether or not this was a terrorist attack,\u201d he told reporters. The Interpol chief added: \u201cAlready in the last 24 hours you see the story changing as the belief becomes more certain that these individuals were probably not terrorists.\u201d He later added that he was inclined to thing the disappearance of the plane was not a terrorist incident. Reuters quoted him saying: \u201cThe more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident.\u201d He also said two Iranian passport holders had swapped their passports in Kuala Lumpur and used stolen Italian and Austrian passports to board the now missing Malaysian airliner. Interpol has revealed the names of two Iranians who boarded flight MH370 on the stolen passports. Speaking at a press conference Interpol\u2019s chief Ronald Noble named one as Pouri Nour Mohammadi who was born on 30 April 1995. The other was Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza born 21 September 1984. The names are those given on their Iranian passports. A second European whose stolen passport was used to board the missing flight MH370 has been speaking to the media. Christian Kozel, a 61 year old former masseur from Salzburg says his passport was stolen years ago in Thailand. A version of his passport was used by 19 year old Iranian Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad to board the missing flight. The other stolen passport belonged to Italian Luigi Maraldi. Malaysia\u2019s defence and acting transport minister has turned to social media looking for leads into the missing plane. \u201cHave we missed anything?\u201d Hishammuddin Hussein asked on his Twitter account. He also said he had ordered the searched to be stepped up to a 24-hour operation. His comments come after criticism of Malaysia from China at the lack of progress. In their latest press conference the Malaysia authorities said they were looking into the psychological background of the 12 crew members on board the missing plane. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told the news conference that they are investigation whether passengers or crew had emotional problems. He said: \u201cWe are looking into four areas: one, hikacking, two sabotate, three psychological problems of the passengers and crew and four personal problems among the passengers and crew.\u201d Reuters has more from the press conference: Adding to the puzzle, Malaysian military radar tracking suggested it may have turned back from its scheduled route. There was no distress signal or radio contact indicating a problem and, in the absence of any wreckage or flight data, police have been left trawling through passenger and crew lists for potential leads. \u201cMaybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money, you know, we are looking at all possibilities,\u201d Bakar told a news conference. \u201cWe are looking very closely at the video footage taken at the KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), we are studying the behavioral pattern of all the passengers.\u201d Malaysia has issued a half-baked apology to the Italian striker Mario Balotelli after its civil aviation chief bizarrely suggested that passengers on the stolen passports looked like him. In a statement its Ministry of Tranportation said:\u201cNo ill feelings were meant to the personality concerned. We hope this clarifies the issue.\u201d At a press conference on Monday civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said the two men, since identified as Iranians, did not look Asian. According to AFP he sought to emphasise that skin colour does not indicate nationality, using the AC Milan striker Balotelli, who was born in Italy to Ghanian parents. \u201cI don\u2019t want to dwell about this but they (nationality and race) are not the same thing,\u201d AFP quoted him saying. Two passengers holding fake passports aboard the Malaysian flight MH370 were Iranians on route to Europe with the aim of seeking asylum, writes Saeed Kamali Dehgan citing the BBC Persian service. \u201cOne of these the two was my friend from high school,\u201d an anonymous Iranian told the Persian service on Monday by phone from Malaysia. \u201cI met him the first day he arrived in Malaysia... he said he was staying for three to four days but was eventually going to Germany, that his final destination was Frankfurt in Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cHe stayed for almost a week in Malaysia. The last night [before the flight] he stayed at mine ... We went together when he booked the flights and I even had his booking number and was checking his flight status online, that\u2019s why I remember which flight he was taking. I had seen his flight number.\u201d \u201cI accompanied them to the airport. It was almost 8pm when we headed to the airport and we arrived around 9pm to 9.15pm at the airport and we stayed in the car for few minutes and chatted.\u201d \u201cThe last night before the flight, they both stayed at mine. His friend was dyeing his beard and hair and was checking the colour [of his hair and beard] to match with the picture of a passport. He was making himself look like the photo in the passport...When we printed the tickets, I realised that the passports were fake. My friend\u2019s passport belonged to an Austrian and my friend\u2019s friend had a passport belonging to an Italian ... They had three flights to take, from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, from Beijing to, I think, Amsterdam and from Amsterdam my friend was heading to Frankfurt and his friend was going to another country.\u201d The Iranian told BBC Persian that his friend\u2019s mother in Iran has since contacted him and asked him to inform the airline about his forged passport. \u201cHis mother told me how he got hold of the fake passport. He had bought the fake passport and wanted to go [to Germany] to seek asylum and his mother told me his son was travelling with another person... My last contact with the two was 11.30pm when they had passed the immigration gate. \u201cI wanted to make sure they\u2019ve found their way. They said they were waiting to get on the plane. I have [since the mother\u2019s contact] informed the airline and this is how I\u2019ve made sure they were aboard the flight.\u201d While neither of the men travelling on stolen passports looked like the Italian footballer Mario Baloletti, the unidentified man does appear to resemble the Italian whose stolen passport he was using. The CCTV image of the goatee-bearded man does look like the Luigi Maraldi, who told Thai police on Sunday that his passport went missing last year. During a press conference a police official said: \u201cThe subject arrived at KLA airport on 28 Feburay ... and presented himself at counter K49 \u2026 He claimed he had arrived from Phuket\u201d. AFP has another helpful graphic on the two area west and east of the Malaysia peninsula that are currently the focus of the extended search for the wreckage missing plane. The Malaysian authorities have released CCTV images of the two men travelling on stolen European passports. Neither of them looks anything like the Italian footballer Mario Balotelli, as Malaysia\u2019s civil Asian chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said on Monday. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take on the latest press conference given by the Malaysian authorities which focused on the passengers travelling on stolen passports: One of the two men traveling on a missing Malaysian Airlines jetliner was a 19-year-old Iranian believed to seeking asylum in Germany, officials said Tuesday, as baffled authorities expanded their search for the Boeing 777 on the opposite side of the country from where it disappeared nearly four days ago with 239 people on board. In the absence of any sign that the plane was in trouble before it vanished, speculation has ranged widely, including pilot error, plane malfunction, hijacking and terrorism, the last because two passengers were traveling on stolen passports. The terrorism theory weakened after Malaysian authorities determined that one of the two men was an Iranian asylum seeker. Malaysian police chief Khalid Tan Sri told reporters the 19-year-old Iranian man was believed to be planning to enter Germany to seek asylum. He said the man was not believed to be a member of a terrorist group. He said the young man\u2019s mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt and had been in contact with the police. He said she contacted Malaysian authorities to inform them of her concern when her son didn\u2019t get in touch with her. Khalid said the other man traveling with the Iranian had arrived in Malaysia on the same day, and had yet to be identified. He said investigators had not ruled out any possibility, including hijacking, sabotage or a personal motive to down the plane by either the crew or passengers. He also said that the police \u201c had no prior information or intelligence about any involvement of terrorists.\u201d In a statement, Malaysia Airlines said search and rescue teams \u201chave expanded the scope beyond the flight path to the West Peninsula of Malaysia at the Straits of Malacca.\u201d An earlier statement had said the western coast of Malaysia was \u201cnow the focus,\u201d but the airline subsequently said that phrase was an oversight. \u201cThe search is on both sides,\u201d Civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said, adding that the previous statement didn\u2019t mean that the plane was more like to be off the western coast. The new statement said authorities are looking at a possibility that MH370 attempted to turn back toward Kuala Lumpur. If it did indeed retrace its path, the plane could conceivably have crashed into the sea on the western coast, the other side of Malaysia from where it was reported missing. But this doesn\u2019t explain why it did not continue to show on radar while flying back toward Kuala Lumpur, and Malaysia Airlines or other authorities have not addressed that question. \u201cAll angles are being looked at. We are not ruling out any possibilities,\u201d is all that the Malaysia Airlines statement said. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the search for the Malaysia Airlines plane almost four days after it went missing with 239 people on board. Paul Farrell in Sydney has just finished tracking the latest developments. Here\u2019s a summary: The search area has been refocussed on the Malacca Straits, west of Malaysia, based on the theory that the plane may have headed to another airport shortly after take off. Malaysia Airlines said nine aircraft and 24 boats are involved in the search. One of the men travelling on a stolen passport has been identified as a 19-year-old Iranian migrant. The Malaysian authorities said that Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad was trying to migrate to Germany and is not thought to be a terrorist. The other passenger on a stolen passport has not be identified as the authorities investigate the backgrounds of all the people on board the flight. Malaysia\u2019s inspector general of police said they were investigating a range of theories including hijacking and sabotage, but also any possible psychological problems of those on board. There has still been no confirmation of any findings of debris from the missing aircraft. Earlier reports from Vietnamese authorities of debris were not substantiated. The United Nations Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation has asked nuclear experts to check for any evidence of an explosion in relation to the missing plane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
