The Ministry of Justice report, which looked at tens of thousands of cases over four years, \u201cdoes not make for happy reading\u201d and highlighted just how many people face barriers to justice, said Jan Logie, under-secretary to the minister of justice. The report, called Attrition and Progression: Reported Sexual Violence Victimisations in the Criminal Justice System, looked at 23,739 claims of sexual violence reported to police between July 2014 and June 2018. For every 100 cases, 31 reached court and only six resulted in a jail term. Of all cases, nearly two-thirds involved a child. The analysis also noted that only about 10% of sexual violence is reported to police. For those cases that result in court action, 13% took two years or more to reach that point. \u201cEveryone deserves to live free from violence and to get the support and resolution they need when they\u2019ve been harmed,\u201d said Logie. \u201cNo single agency or department can fix this on their own. We have to work together, work differently and work across the whole justice system so every person harmed can get the resolution they need.\u201d Logie said statistics available in the past year, after the ministry\u2019s latest report, suggested the number of sexual assault investigations \u201cresulting in court action\u201d had since risen by a third, and that the proportion of allegations classed as a crime had risen. The ministry said legislation would be introduced this year to improve the statistics, including tightening rules on disclosure of a victim\u2019s sexual history, allowing them to give evidence via videolink, and helping judges to intervene in unfair questioning and dispel myths about sexual violence. Sexual violence prevention network Toah Nnest welcomed the comprehensive report but said: \u201cThe whole system requires change as the problems are not isolated to one area of the justice process.\u201d It praised the analysis as a much-needed baseline and said improvements had been made since the Bazley police inquiry that began in 2005. Spokesman Russell Smith said: \u201cWe are pleased to see this level of attention being paid to this longstanding problem. The hope is this will lead to engaging in a more empathic way where wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori [family] are effectively heard and appropriately responded to.\u201d A recent survey by the network found the justice system can further traumatise survivors, make them feel \u201cincidental to the trial process\u201d and did not prioritise the safety and needs of children. It also found that most survivors wish to prevent reoffending by those who are convicted, but that many offenders do not receive appropriate treatment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
