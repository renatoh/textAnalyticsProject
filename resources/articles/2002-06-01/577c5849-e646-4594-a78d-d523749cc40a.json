The 29-year-old Windsor runner was heavily tipped to go one better than in Kuala Lumpur four years ago, when he won the silver medal behind Iwan Thomas, and also to be among the favourites to win the European Championship in Munich in August. Intensive physiotherapy has failed to cure the injury, thought to be similar to the one that afflicted Merry, and he now faces surgery. \"I'm not exactly sure of the nature of the problem; it is quite complicated,\" he said. \"I first felt the problem two years ago while I was warm-weather training and I've been plagued by it for some time.\" It is the latest setback for Richardson in a career which appeared set for great things in 1998 when he defeated Michael Johnson in Oslo in a personal best of 44.37sec, only to test positive for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone the following year. He was cleared by UK Athletics in 2000 but prevented from running in the Sydney Olympics when the International Association of Athletics Federations referred the case to its arbitration panel. He was later banned for two years but reinstated early by the IAAF when he agreed to head an education programme on the risk of nutritional supplements. He won his return race and was tipped as a gold medallist in the World Championships in Edmonton before his achilles problems struck and he was knocked out in the semi-final. He now hopes to be back in time for the 2003 World Championships in Paris, but his biggest target is the following year in Athens. \"The main aim is to be fit for the 2004 Olympics and if I have to sacrifice this year then so be it,\" he said. \"There is always a risk with surgery but my main aim is to get 100% healthy and carry on with the rest of my career. Without a doubt I can return to my best.\" Britain's 400m cupboard, once so well stocked, is beginning to look bare. Jamie Baulch and Thomas, Richardson's team-mates when Britain won silver in the 4x400m relay in the 1996 Olympics, have yet to run this season. Britain's hopes in Manchester and Munich appear to rest on the world indoor champion Daniel Caines, who ran 45.39 when he finished second behind Jamaica's Gregory Haughton in Seville last Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
