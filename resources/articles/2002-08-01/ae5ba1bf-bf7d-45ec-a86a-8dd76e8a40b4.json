I decide to find the Guardian and bring it to the loo. Despite the fact that the day is almost over, the Guardian is still lying unread in the reception office, no one has time to read newspapers in today's probation service. Skimming through I notice that Public Voices is headlining the views of a recently retired probation officer, Richard Spence, who says: \"The probation service is a mess. Flog it off.\" As I read, I hear the voices of the many staff I've spoken to this week. [For Mr Spence's full text, see his July 25 entry below on the Public Voices site.] I am a probation officer and co-chair of the local branch of Napo the trade union and professional association for probation staff. While I certainly don't agree with Richard's prescription for sorting out the probation service - privatise it - the concerns he expresses reflect the thoughts of many current staff. Richard is retired and can speak freely. I chose to protect myself by saying I speak as a trade unionist rather than an employee. I'm mindful that two colleagues and Napo members were disciplined for contacting the national organisation Investors in People to talk about how the local probation service is run. At the time, the local area was applying for good-practice recognition from Investors in People. I'm 31 years younger than Richard (who is 63) and have been in and around the probation service for 10 years, working as a probation officer for six of them. In 1996, the year I completed training, Michael Howard [Conservative home secretary 1993-97] removed the requirement for probation officers to hold a diploma in social work. Until then probation officers had been trained social workers choosing to specialise in work with offenders. The decline in the state of the probation service - spoken of by Richard - I trace back to then. Not only did Mr Howard remove the qualification, but his action created a vacuum: there was no alternative training programme put in place until 1998, by which time the service was severely haemorrhaging. Staff uncertain of their future transferred to allied sectors. In the same year Teesside probation service started appointing non-probation officers to posts previously held by probation officers. Napo challenged that and secured the \"Teesside judgment\", which ruled against Napo's claim but did provide guidelines to how non-probation staff should be managed. Services have largely ignored those guidelines, and we've seen the wholesale appointment of non-probation officer staff. Probation officers are left to supervise the cases of \"high risk\" offenders and write pre-sentence reports for courts. Other staff deal with medium- and low-risk offenders. The culture change in probation work was encapsulated by Paul Boateng when he was Labour's minister for probation in 2000. He stated: \"We are a law enforcement agency. It's what we are, it's what we do.\" That showed the shift away from what had been largely a system of one-to-one rehabilitation and supervision of offenders by people with a social work background whose job was to understand all the factors that influence a person deciding to commit an offence. As probation officers have become scarcer the demands on them have become greater, yet the body in overall charge of the service - the national probation directorate - hasn't put in place a system of measuring workloads. Napo's national executive committee has voted for industrial action over this, and has been canvassing branches on what form this should take. The executive committee is scheduled to make a decision in September, after hearing any further response from the directorate in the preceding week. In the absence of a basic workload measurement - which management says will take another year at least - cases rise and reports rise. So, I suggest, does the staff sickness rate. Meanwhile, offenders meant to be monitored are told to keeping reporting in at probation offices until a supervising officer is available. They show up, sign on a dotted line, and return home - a meaningless exercise. Another reason for getting a standard measurement of workloads is that the probation service actually consists of 44 different areas around the country, not one big national service as you might think from its name and the fact that its central body is called the national probation directorate. In fact, each area has a different caseload, and each is run by a separate board. So you've got a mix of what's expected of staff from one area to another, and the staff union has to try to deal with 44 different services on what should be nationally agreed terms and conditions. There is national code but each area can put its own interpretation on that. And if there's a dispute staff in each area have to go into a separate dispute with the employer, which preempts national action. All this makes for problematic industrial relations. Overall, I think it's fair to say that prisons and prisoners probably form a quarter of the probation service's work - the rest involves supervising people serving their sentences in the community. The group courses we run for offenders - programmes in managing anger or thinking in a different way - constitute a great initiative; but due to lack of staff, offenders are on waiting lists for months before they can get on these courses. On top of that, the assessments we've been told do before and after people take these courses are just gathering dust. Since April 2001, each person has been given these psychometric tests, on the instructions of the Home Office. Each test can take up to three hours, and they are good tests - but there's no money to interpret the results. So there they sit, tests done but never scored or interpreted. Unfortunately, as Richard Spence states, I fear we're seeing the service fall in on itself. The appointment of manager upon manager has led to a bureaucratic organisation, which not uniquely spends more time servicing itself rather than the business it is in. The national directorate alone has in excess of 200 staff. Meanwhile, in the courts, where the business of the probation service is generated, judges and magistrates are receiving letters from probation managers across the country saying that requested pre-sentence reports on people who've been convicted are unavailable due to lack of report writers. No surprise the courts are getting frustrated, though I trust they realise probation officers stretched themselves as long as they could to prevent the situation having an impact on court proceedings. To try to measure performance by probation service areas, the first league tables have been put out this summer by the national probation directorate [probation circular 39/02 released June 27, 2002 and viewable at www.probation2000.co.uk]. And, also for the first time, probation services have been financially penalised for not meeting targets. These targets don't exist in a vacuum, though. A good example is the requirement that we prosecute people who breach the terms of their community sentences by failing to attend appointments or course sessions - that's one of the areas in which our performance is assessed. The league-tables circular showed that all but one of the 44 probation areas lost money because they're below the targets in three key areas; prosecuting over breaches is one of these. They may be coming in short of the target, but the volume of prosecutions is now so high that special courts have had to be set up within magistrates' courts to deal with all the cases for breach brought by the probation service. So targets like that have knock-on effects elsewhere in the system. At the same time, the number of actual breaches is very high - from my experience, I'd say perhaps 80% of offenders are breaching the terms of their community sentences in various ways - being late for appointments or not showing up. Yes, we can prosecute, but most courts aren't going to send people to prison for these breaches, so what they usually do is fine them and return them to probation to continue the work. There's another problem with prosecutions in these cases: quite a few people just ignore them. When we prosecute, a court summons goes out to the person accused of breaching his or her community sentence terms. If that person doesn't respond to the summons, the court issues a warrant. But police in many areas now won't serve warrants for community sentence\u00e6breaches; there's so many of them. Many courts have got civilian staff to execute the warrants, but if that staff consists of only one or two people it won't be enough. The direct result of the high number of breaches and prosecutions is that in excess of 100,000 warrants are outstanding - that is, they're being ignored by the people they're addressed to. What's more alarming is that if the warrant is outstanding for more than a year, the authorities in some areas simply withdraw it: the offender incurs no punishment and may not bother to finish the community sentence, while the person who has answered summons is punished, has the punishment added to his or her criminal record, as well as presumably carrying on with the community service. Paperwork is another problem area at the moment. This involves a national system that's being brought in (called Oasys) which the prison and probation services are meant to use to assess the risk level of an offender: risk to the public, risk of reoffending, risk of self harm. It's quite a good tool - but it only exists in paper form. The prison service has decided it won't start using Oasys until there's a computerised version, which is at least a year away. The probation service has started using the new system . . . meaning we've gone from our previous computerised system back to paper! For each offender we deal with, we're currently filling out 25-38 pages. I could go on, but then does anyone really care about the collapse of the probation service? After all, it's only dealing with offenders. - Gordon Jackson, who is based in Luton, is contributing to Public Voices as co-chair of the Chiltern counties branch of Napo (the trade union and professional association of probation staff) which covers Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire probation areas. He also works as a probation officer in Bedfordshire - Footnote: Reflecting the concerns expressed in several contributions to Public Voices, probation staff voted to stage a one-day strike on January 29, 2003, and afterwards to work contractual hours. Their union, Napo, said: \"Over the last decade probation workloads have increased by 50%. Currently in excess of 15% of the probation workforce is leaving each year. Napo has been raising the issue of the need for manageable workloads with officials for the last three years. Since that time the Probation Service has taken on numerous new tasks such as youth offender work, drug treatment orders and intensive group work without a commensurate increase in resources.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
