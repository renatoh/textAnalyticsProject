Yes, they're regulars in the Champions League knock-out stages but the fact is Lyon have never beaten a European giant over two legs. Until they do so they'll never be able to claim they're the best French club side of all time despite their unprecedented domestic dominance. Tonight, on the back of foul form, they will come at United with a jittery defence, brittle morale and disjointed play. United are clear favourites. On the upside, Lyon do have a quality midfield and, most excitingly, an exceptional front trio including 20-year-old sensation Karim Benzema. Alain Perrin says his primary concern is not to concede an 'away' goal - fielding both Anthony R\u00e9veill\u00e8re and Fran\u00e7ois Clerc on the right confirms that - but I foresee failure on that front. Note from an early bird \"I am writing from Kenya in Africa,\" booms Bethwell Enaga. \"I think United will win this 2-1 with goals from Ronaldo and Rooney and a consolation from Benzema.\" If only because I'm aggrieved that you felt the need to specify to me the whereabouts of Kenya, I refuse to agree with you, Bethwell. I'm saying 3-2, with a hat-trick from the boy Benzema, who can do everything Wayne Rooney can do - and finish. Pity Hatem Ben Arfa's on the bench. Teams: Lyon: 1-Gregory Coupet; 20-Anthony Reveillere, 32-Jean-Alain Boumsong, 29-Sebastien Squillaci, 11-Fabio Grosso; 2-Francois Clerc, 6-Kim Kallstrom, 28-Jeremy Toulalan, 8-Juninho; 14-Sidney Govou, 10-Karim Benzema. Manchester United: 1-Edwin van der Sar; 6-Wes Brown, 5-Rio Ferdinand, 15-Nemanja Vidic, 3-Patrice Evra; 18-Paul Scholes, 4-Owen Hargreaves, 8-Anderson; 7-Cristiano Ronaldo, 10-Wayne Rooney, 11-Ryan Giggs. Referee: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Spain) 7.35pm: \"I predict 2-0 to Lyon, with Sir Alex complaining bitterly post-match that different sets of rules apply to predominantly French teams,\" belches Brett Henrikson. \"As for the biggest match in Europe tonight. We are playing a team who have a knack of beating us in our own backyard, but I still think we can win,\" retorts Ewan Benson before adding with a predictable chortle. \"So, 3-1 to Motherwell.\" 7.38pm: Meanwhile on the desk beside me, larks aplenty as Scott Murray tries to change the channel to receive the match he's supposed to be commentating on but somehow falls off his chair in the process and maims his upper arm. Just you watch as he tries to fob the delay in coverage off on some \"technical error\" ... 7.41pm: It's a cracking atmosphere in the Gerland with the home faithful bouncing up and down and roaring lustily in anticipation of the teams' entrance. Speaking of roaring lustily, here's Dela Vale: \"I am writing on my fancy new Blackberry from Toronto, Canada,\" she roars lustily. \"That's in North American, by the way.\" Thanks Dela, and your point is? \"It will be a romp for united. 3-0! Nani, Louis Saha and Ronaldo - a prophet has spoken.\" Yes, well the fact that two of your predicted scorers are starting on the bench suggests you're not a prophet who makes much profit. Ba-doom tish. 1 min: Ah lovely: as per a tradition that's more than a century old, the football match begins with a kick-off. Lyon's, if you must know. 2 min: Toulalan lofts a long pass towards Benzema who sets off in chase to the delight of the home crowd. Not so much to their pleasure is the fact that Vidic gets to the ball first. 5 min: Two decent crosses by Grosso are cleared in extremis but Ferdinand. Then Ronaldo pegs down the other end and lets fly from 20 yards - his shot is deflected wide by Boumsong. \"I'm disappointed by Fergie's choice to play both Giggs and Scholes in this one,\" reveals Nick Williamson. \"They're not the same players they were last year, never mind five years ago. He is probably thinking that their experience will help us keep the ball, but we really should be getting at this defence and try to plunder as many away goals as possible. Giggs will give the ball away with his daft flicks when he has his back to goal, and Scholes only ever seems to go sideways then backwards these days. It's like the last days of Keano.\" It's fair point, Nick, and suggests, surprisingly, that Ferguson is not aware that 0-0 away really isn't such a hot result in Europe these days. 7 min: Chaos in the United box after Govou collects a neat Juninho cross. Evra and Ferdinand converge on him and manage to snaffle the ball out for a corner - which Benzema meets at the back post. But his connection is feeble and van der Sar gathers comfortably. 10 min: Rooney exhibits his poxy finishing skills by firing 100 yards wide from 21 yards. An impressive geometric feat, if nothing else. 13 min: Boumsong passes to a team-mate. Newcastle fans will understand why I thought that was worthy of a mention. \"I'm writing from Washington,\" boats Justin Kavanagh before adding oh so wittily: \"That's in America, Paul.\" Thanks Justin, but where is America? And do you have anything more interesting to say? \"I think the score will be: a humility of Lyons 1, A whine of Mancunians 2 (but they'll still complain),\" concludes Justin. 16 min: Juninho swings in a magnificent free-kick that Ferdinand does well to bop over the bar just before Squillaci could butt it into the net. 19 min: Vidic tugs Benzema's shirt, giving Lyon a free-kick in Juninho territory, ie some 35 yards from goal. The Brazilian unleashes a rocket, but Scholes gets a touch to take the sting out of it and it droops innocently into van der Sar's arms. Meanwhile, how about this for a fascinating revelation: Lyon are being managed by a former Argentina president. Or so thinks Sky commentator Andy Gray, who insists on calling their gaffer 'Alan Peron'. 21 min: Clerc, who performing with unexpected brio down the right flank, curls a tempting cross towards the back post. Ferdinand intercepts but shanks an attempted clearance fractionally wide of his own post! 23 min: After a succession of Lyon corners yielded nothing, United launched a sudden breakaway. Rooney latched on to a throughball from Giggs, beats the last defender and finds himself one-on-one with Coupet, who pounces at the striker's feet to divert the danger. Excellent goalkeeping. 25 min: Lovely move by Lyon. Clerc was again integral to it; his centre found Benzema, who had peeled away from his markers, but the youngsters fired his shot just over the bar. 29 min: Ronaldo produces several thousands lollipops before shooting from the edge of the box. It's blocked easily by Boumsong. \"How is it that Boumsong was a success at Rangers and now at Lyon and played like Coco the Clown at Newcastle?\" wonders Mike Cameron. Well, considering he only joined Lyon a few weeks ago it's a bit early to describe him as a success there, Mike. 34 min: Ronaldo blems a free-kick straight into the wall, then blazes the rebound out of the stadium. \"If Juande Ramos is looking for a goalkeeper, he could do very well to pry Coupet away from Lyon,\" insists George Templeton. \"You would've thought a big club in England, Spain or Italy would've spirited him away from Lyon by now.\" Well, Coupet was certainly angling for a move abroad last summer, George, but I suspect his occasional dodginess under crosses put potential suitors off. Mind you, he's still safer than van der Sar, whose increasing fallibility is one of the reasons United won't win any trophies, let alone the treble this season. 38 min: Hargreaves hacks down Govou at the edge of the box but somehow escapes a booking from the ref, who has just booked two Lyon players for far less aggressive challenges. The Lyon players are furious and Boumsong is booked for protesting. Then, bizarrely, the ref changes his mind and books Hargreaves too. Meanwhile, Juninho' lines up the free ... and clatters it over the bar. By the way, you can stop all stop telling me your locations now; I'm tired of that gag now. Unless you're beyond Earth, or at its core, I'm not interested any more. 31 min: Excellent show of strength from Benzema who barges Anderson off the ball fairly before slipping a tidy pass through to Govou, whose control betrays him. 41 min: It's an engrossing game, lost of dynamism and skill from both sides, especially Lyon, who are looking the more likely to score even if they haven't created any really clear chances yet. United have been menacing on the break. 43 min: Slinky run by Govou, who beats two in the middle and then ... passes straight to Ronaldo! United romp forward quickly, Ronaldo exchanging snappy passes with Rooney, and after some trickery from the Portuguese R\u00e9veill\u00e8re saves the day with a splendid slide tackle deep inside the Lyon box. 45 min: Half-time. But just before the whistle Coupet punched a Ronaldo free-kick wide, Giggs swung in the corner and Ronaldo nodded it over from eight yards. \"Is Scholes even on the pitch?\" harrumphs Todd Landaburu. \"I'm stuck at work and all I have is you to describe the proceedings.\" I can confirm that he is on the pitch, Todd, and that he had done nothing of note so far. If he perks up, I'll let you know. Similarly, if he lies down for a snooze in the centre circle I'll point out that it's made no difference to his overall contribution. Insert half-time pep talk here. I will if anyone fancies sending me same. 46 min: We're back. \"Paul Scholes has done nothing?\" barks a man called Chris. Or perhaps a woman, come to think of it. \"Are you watching the same game?\" I don't know, which one are you watching? \" Giggs and Scholes are linking brilliantly and instinctively. One of them will score in the second half, thanks to the other.\" I bet you six zloty that neither will score, Chris. 49 min: An aimless punt from Ferdinand dribbles out of play. \"It looks like Nani is coming on,\" claims Mike Hopkins. \"Will every touch he has be scrutinized for it's showboating merits?\" Sure, if you want, Mike - but tell us, how do you know Nani's coming on - are you in the ground? The TV has shown no sign of such a change. GOAL! Lyon 1-0 United (Benzema 54) 54 min: United had monopolised possession since the resumption without creating anything more dangerous than a Scholes pot-shot from 25 yards that Coupet claimed easily. Then Lyon plodded forward and Benzema picked up the ball 25 yards from goal and surrounded by four United players. He took one touch to control it, manoeuvred into position then cracked a superb low shot into the bottom corner - the boy's a genius! The new Ronaldo, I tell you. 56 min: The crowd exult as Benzema picks up a loose ball on half-way and starts to gallop towards goal. But Ferdinand outmuscles him - a mighty feat by the defender, in fairness. 59 min: United applying pressure but again it's all in front of the Lyon defence, who are repelling it admirably. Crosses such as the hopeful one from Brown three seconds ago won't cut the mustard tonight. 62 min: Benzema shrugs off Vidic and then rolls the ball sideways to Juninho, who for once decides not to shoot and instead passes to Grosso wide on the left. The Italian's cross is cleared and suddenly Ronaldo can race free towards the Lyon box - his cross is palmed behind by Coupet. And the subsequent corner cleared. 65 min: United substitutions: Scholes is deservedly taken off, replaced by Nani. And Carlos Tevez totters on for Giggs. That's six zloty in the bag for me. Meanwhile, this: \"Hurrah! Benzema 1-0 Rooney,\" sums up Chris Oquendo. So far, Chris, so far. 67 min: Sweeping move by Lyon, Juninho and Kallstrom combining well before Clerc flashes the ball across the face of the goal. Van der Sar dives to intercept. 68 min: Outstanding block by Boumsong after Hargreaves had teed up Rooney with a cunning flick 69 min: Marvellous free-kick from Juninho, who shaves the post from 35 yards! Van der Sar was nowhere near it. 71 min: GOAL! Oh no it's not! Tevez shouldered the ball towards the goal and Rooney, in a blatantly offside positions, pokes into the net just to be sure. Not even Ferguson can protest about that being disallowed. 73 min: Lyon are dropping very deep now, allowing United to come on to them. Though they've defended valiantly so far, surely that's not a wise policy? 74 min: Lyon substitution: Juninho, jaded, is taken off for Mathieu Bodmer, who doesn't possess the Brazilian's repertoire of shot but is a canny goal-getter nonetheless. 77 min: Govou has a great shooting opportunity in the United box but dithers and is engulfed by Vidic and Ferdinand. The chance dies. \"If Boumsong keeps playing like this it will prove that the Newcastle shirt is cursed and anyone that has put it on since Bobby Robson's undeserved dismissal is doomed to being rubbish for as long as they wear it,\" mourns George Templeton. 79 min: Here's a bold and welcome by Perrin: Hatem Ben Arfa, the 20-year-old wing wizard who proves that Benzema isn't the only thrilling youngster at Lyon, has just been introduced for the more defensive-minded Clerc. Less thrillingly, Michael Carrick has come on for Hargreaves. 81 min: Ben Arfa dances past two on the edge of the United box but then blazes over. A pass to the unmarked Benzema was surely the better option. 83 min: Benzema exits to a standing ovation and is replaced by beefy Brazilian international Fred. 85 min: United going nowhere so Nani crosses desperately. Boumsong boots it contemptuously into the stands. GOAL! Lyon 1-1 United (Tevez 87) 87 min: Evra draws a foul at the corner of the Lyon box. Ronaldo goes for a goal and Coupet tips it behind. The corner sails all the way across to Carrick at the back post but his shot is blocked by Fred. United work the ball out to Nani on the right and he clips a decent ball into the centre. Squillaci somehow fails to clear, it bobbles around a bit and Tevez slams it into the roof of the net! Lyon's defensive woes surface again. 90+1 min: Wouldn't it have been better if Sir Alex had left his team from the weekend untampered with?\" waaahs Tariq Choudry. \"They seemed more hungry than Scholes, Giggs etc, who look decidedly off the pace.\" Yes, that's true, Tariq. Ferguson's would have paid for his caution if it weren't for Lyon's defensive ricks. He should have attacked this brittle side with greater conviction from the outset. Still, 1-1's a decent result and they are surely favourites to go through. 90+3 min: The game peters out to an ending that suits United much more than Lyon. Thanks for following it with GU. Hope to hear from you again some time soon. Bye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
