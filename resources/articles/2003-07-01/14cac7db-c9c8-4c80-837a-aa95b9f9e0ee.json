For some years she has been campaigning to get me to call out crossword clues properly. The \"proper\" method is to say the number of letters first, then the clue, then any checked letters and then the number of letters again. \"It's not a clue,\" I replied. \"What is it then?\" \"I don't know. I suppose you'd call it a 'remark'.\" \"Oh.\" We were in bed at the time and the sun was rising over London. \"What made you say that?\" I supposed I had said it because my Russian teacher had drummed it into us the previous evening. \"Today we will do the accusative,\" he said. He has a habit of stressing two or three words in every sentence. \"The accusative is the object of the sentence. The object of the exercise, on the otherhand, is that you will learn about nouns.\" The effect was to make me seasick, bobbing about as I was on the choppy seas of his scansion. But you take my point. Never again in our house will a word be used as though it has one meaning. By breakfast, therefore, storm clouds were gathering. \"You don't understand how I feel,\" said my girlfriend. I hesitate to say petulantly. She wrested the newspaper from me and went to drink her coffee. \"You're imagining things,\" I replied. There was a silence, mostly in the accusative. \"I'm sure all I feel includes more than what I imagine,\"* she said eventually. But since she failed to call out the number of letters (four and four), I had no way of knowing that this was not \"a remark\", but a clue - taken from that morning's Cinephile puzzle in the Financial Times. For which I blame her. Or him. Or anyone other than me. * Answer: Real Life. \u00b7 The X-Philes, our new crossword column, will appear here every Friday. \ufffd Sandy Balfour.
