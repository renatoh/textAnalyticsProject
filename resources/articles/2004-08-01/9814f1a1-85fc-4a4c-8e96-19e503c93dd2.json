Or a detective story, if that sounds more dignified. This column does not write about the genre on the grounds that it has not read one since 1987, and that there is a far more experienced critic of this type of book elsewhere in these pages. But Dibdin writes the kind of policiers that get reviewed in the TLS, and the latest one had just dropped through the letterbox, and I was going on holiday, and this is the kind of thing you're meant to read on holiday... I now begin to understand the attraction. Like a pensioner discovering crack cocaine and liking it, I wonder at the wasted years I have spent not reading thrillers. I could have been having so much more fun. The books I tend to read and approve of do not have quite so many dead bodies, nail-biting chases, sinister conspiracies, or world-weary expos\u00e9s of the cynical corruption at the heart of the body politic. All these, Dibdin has. I had already, through skimming the reviews, learned that he had a hero called Aurelio Zen, a Venetian detective who is, in his quiet way, a bit of an epicure (fussy about his food and fags, likes a spot of grappa), something of a lone wolf, wholly moral, but not above annoying his superiors or bending the rules to achieve results. Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean. From what I recall of the genre, this applies, mutatis mutandis, to every detective since Sherlock Holmes. One wonders if there is a market for stories about cheerful, gregarious detectives with happy home lives who eat and drink any old crap and do everything by the book. So Zen may be a clich\u00e9 - but he's a very refined version of one. Dibdin has been both clever and brave to make him not just Italian but Venetian - he has to negotiate the fantastically complex networks of corruption and regional and political rivalry that make up the central nervous system of Italy. Moreover, Italy has conspiracies the way dogs have fleas, so the idea of a moral Italian policeman is almost funny - and Dibdin knows this. Recent developments make the comedy both richer and darker. At one point, asking whether an old pal isn't doing something illegal, Zen receives a reply giving concise details of Silvio Berlusconi's breathtaking response to the crimes he has been accused of. (Basically, making them no longer crimes.) \"And you're asking me if what I'm doing is illegal?\" Medusa begins with the discovery of a body in an abandoned military tunnel - only it has been lying there for 30 years or so. Pretty soon people are being bumped off in sinister fashions, and Zen starts poking his nose in and annoying people at the highest level. At which point I realise that not only does the plot summary sound unavoidably like a string of non-surprises, it does a disservice to the book as well as spoiling the pleasure of finding out for yourself what happens next. Further research into Dibdin's Zen - I asked Faber to send me the rest, and have now inhaled five of them - indicates that the books are, basically, like going on holiday in Italy but without being bitten by mosquitoes, while at the same time learning about the seamy side of Italian politics and institutions. Not that there is any other side, it seems, even if sometimes the corruption or conspiracy happens by sheer accident. Zen travels all over the place, allowing him to annoy superiors in a variety of atmospheric locations. The ultimate punishment, it would appear, is a posting to Sicily. In Medusa he is at the other end of the country, in the Alto Adige, the mountainous region next to Austria, inhabited by resentful Germanophones. But this is really a sideline to the book's real interest: the fallout from the battles between the military and the Italian left in the 60s. Even without the murder element, it is a useful look at history, and so knowledgeable that you could be fooled for thinking it had been expertly translated from the Italian. I suspect that this is a deliberate policy. I wonder: how well does Zen go down in Italy?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
