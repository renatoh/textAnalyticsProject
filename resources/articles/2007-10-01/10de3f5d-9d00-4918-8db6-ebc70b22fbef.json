But when the job is done badly, democracy fails. Even small errors can undermine trust in the whole process of choosing people to govern, as concern about postal votes and possible fraud has shown. So when electoral administrators warn of a serious problem with a snap autumn election, they ought to be listened to. On Sunday John Turner, from the Association of Electoral Administrators, used a BBC interview to warn of the big difficulty of a November election. Many people who might want to vote in it may not be able to, because their names are not on the register. Now being updated, the new electoral list comes into force on December 1 - well after anyone expects a poll this year. People who have filled in forms this autumn, and assumed that will allow them to vote, may be disappointed. Only people who registered in 2006, or who decide themselves to add their details near the start of an election, will be included. Research suggests that although 91% of people do register, young people, minorities and inner-city residents and people who move house often are likely to be missed. If Gordon Brown does call a snap election, they will only have six working days to include themselves. They can do it by using an form available online at aboutmyvote.co.uk. Filling it in is a chore. But democracy depends on it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
