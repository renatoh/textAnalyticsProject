One that - how can I put this delicately - arouses the footballerati. I suspect Craig Foster, for one, watches Adelaide with a pillow over his lap. But then here\u2019s the rub (settle); Foster, just like Adelaide\u2019s fans, is ultimately denied satisfaction. For what does all of Adelaide\u2019s good looks, pillow talk and smooth moves amount to without consummation? Adelaide thrashed Perth last week, yet Glory escaped with a 1-all draw. Does such a result undermine Adelaide\u2019s aesthetic? How could it not? Especially when it mirrors what happened in each of Adelaide\u2019s five losses to date this season. In all of those games \u2014against the Mariners (Mariners!), Wellington, Newcastle (Newcastle!), Brisbane and Victory\u2014 Adelaide dominated completed passes and possession, with the 57.2% possession they enjoyed against Victory being the lowest, and the 66% they had against Newcastle being the highest (it was 63.1% against Perth). And in all but one of those games they\u2019ve had more shots than their opposition, sometimes a lot more (17-9 against Perth). Yet in all those six games combined they\u2019ve earned one lousy point. Yes, Adelaide are still just four points from first place but this is surely a worrying trend that Josep Gombau needs to address given there\u2019s a competition to be won, not just charmed. And it may just need more than keeping his attackers back for an extra half hour\u2019s shooting practice after training. Brisbane\u2019s resurgence under threat Premiers Brisbane shockingly began the season with two wins from seven matches but since the sacking of 2013-14 double-winning coach Mike Mulvey in late November Brisbane have won four, drawn three, and lost two. And three of those four wins under Frans Thijssen have come in the past three rounds. Brisbane, of course, aren\u2019t \u201cback\u201d, and never will be - if you understand back to mean where they were last season. The main reason for that is that they are not the same team, the off-season denuding them of some handy players, and players key to their structure and style. But Brisbane have certainly shown their reinvention under Thijssen has borne some fruit and, with the help of some key goals from Carlos Solorzano and the return to fitness and form of Thomas Broich, the Roar are in the top six for the first time this season \u2014their 2-0 win over the Mariners last week seeing them leapfrog Melbourne City. Particularly pleasing for Thijssen and Roar fans is that their recent wins have shown evidence of spirit at the club. You don\u2019t win consecutive games in injury time (Wellington and Newcastle) unless you\u2019re in it together. But what an examination of their rejuvenation the Roar now face \u2014and without the injured Solorzado at that. They have Melbourne Victory on Friday night (\u201cWelcome Home, Besart!\u201d the banners are unlikely to read) before facing Perth away the following week. And their Asian Champions League campaign gets underway on Wednesday night, not the best timing really for a team that needs to concentrate all its energies on the league. Crunch time for City Take down the bunting, put down the cake, Melbourne City\u2019s effortful mid-season surge that garnered 10 points from a possible 12 is officially over. Since their year ending 5-2 bacchanalia against Newcastle, City have won four points from 12, and three of those were against the Wanderers so they barely count (imagine saying that last season?). City\u2019s hangover hasn\u2019t been helped \u2014or perhaps it\u2019s been triggered\u2014 by injuries to Ben Garuccio, Rob Wielaert, Erik Paartalu and James Brown and now it appears that Irishman Damien Duff is gone for the season which is a real blow for City. While that will spare us his scowling visage (has anyone looked as unhappy to be playing football for a living than Duff? It\u2019s as if someone pissed in his pint 15 years ago and he\u2019s never gotten over it) it will deny City his admirable industry and his link play with City\u2019s forwards. And they need all the link play they can get. City\u2019s slump has also coincided with a return to the kind of shooting that tests the durability of advertising hoardings more than it does goalkeepers. Just two goals in their past four games. He hasn\u2019t had much time to get his eye in but Josh Kennedy needs to get his Jesus impression out again. And newcomer Kew Jaliens will need to hit the ground running (should he get clearance to play in time). Especially since City\u2019s next two opponents are Perth and Adelaide. Who\u2019s going to fill the onion bag? Perth Glory and Wellington Phoenix are both going through a relatively lean spot, and their lack of wins corresponds to a lack of goals from their leading scorers Andy Keogh and Nathan Burns respectively. The league\u2019s leading scorer, Nathan Burns (with 10 in 15 appearance), hasn\u2019t scored in his past four games, the Asian Cup interrupting a very nice run he had going. Keogh is still third on the goal-scorers list (with 9 in 17) but his early season form has tailed away somewhat and he\u2019s now scored just one goal from open play in his past six games. That\u2019s as many times as he\u2019s been arrested in the past week. He\u2019ll be looking to make amends against Melbourne City. Keogh\u2019s dry spell has allowed Besart Berisha to overtake him with 9 goals in 16 and who\u2019d bet against Berisha scoring against his old team this weekend? And will he celebrate if he does? I hope so. The non-celebrating of goals against former teams is really a bit daft. I mean, sure, you shouldn\u2019t drop the shorts and give it the old helicopter, but I really can\u2019t see what is so provocative about a big smile and the classic raising of an arm. Any fan who takes umbrage at that is surely small-minded. Culture wars Sydney FC and their defender Seb Ryall sure have copped it this week. Since Ryall\u2019s penalty-winning tumble in the Big Blue last weekend the flames haven\u2019t yet died down and this week, before the FFA ruled that Ryall was not guilty of simulation (merely guilty of making the most of a slight tap which, when you think about it, would meet definition of simulation for many people) we had Victory\u2019s Kosta Barbarouses throwing petrol into the mix with his comments that he\u2019d lost respect for Ryall (who also took a swipe at Gui Finkler after picking himself up) and insinuating that Sydney\u2019s culture was questionable. It\u2019s a provocative dig, that, and it should make the next fixture between the teams worthy of a big bowl of popcorn. But is Sydney\u2019s culture questionable? Is Melbourne\u2019s any better, for that matter? The stats don\u2019t show much difference between the teams when it comes to cards, about the only way we can make some kind of a judgement. Sydney FC, for example, have earned 34 yellow and 3 red cards so far this season. Victory is only narrowly behind (or in front, I suppose) with 33 and 1. Of course the incident with Ryall (which led to Graham Arnold saying he\u2019d give his charge a talking to and make him do the washing up for a week) came after two players were sent off against Perth and perhaps it created a false impression in Barbarouses\u2019 eyes, but the stats certainly don\u2019t paint a picture of Sydney being particularly ill-disciplined. That said, speaking of culture, one will be keeping an eye on Sydney this week when they host neighbours, the Central Coast Mariners. You\u2019ll recall the Mariners club didn\u2019t exactly roll out the red carpet when Arnold and his team visited Gosford recently. Will Sydney have the manners to forget about the Mariners\u2019 indiscretion, as good etiquette demands when someone you\u2019re chatting to accidentally spits in your face when talking animatedly?
