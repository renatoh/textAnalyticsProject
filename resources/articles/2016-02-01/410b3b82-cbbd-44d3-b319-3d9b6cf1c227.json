Tell us why", "bodyText": "You wouldn\u2019t bring it up in the office. You might not tell your friends (or even your partner). You might claim to #feeltheBern or support #Rubiomentum. But secretly, you\u2019re hoping Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination and then goes all the way to the White House. We know you\u2019re out there and we want to chat with you (anonymously!) for a story we\u2019re working on. We\u2019re particularly interested in why you support Trump \u2013 is it because of something he\u2019s done or said? Is it because of other candidates? What appeals most about him? Was there a particular moment when you become a Trump supporter? Who have you voted for previously?
