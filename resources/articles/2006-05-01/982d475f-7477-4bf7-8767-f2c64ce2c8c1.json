He's currently on tour and his party piece is \"Guts\", one of the 23 stories that make up Haunted. So far 70-odd people have hit the deck after hearing this literally gut-wrenching tale of a legal career thwarted by masturbation. The rest of the stories here are almost as shocking - killer reflexologists at large and dastardly goings-on in the green rooms of third-rate TV stations lighten dark offerings about werewolves and mysterious ticking boxes - but the conceit in which they are wrapped is truly horrific. Echoes of Edgar Allan Poe and Byron's summer party at the Villa Diodati reverberate as we learn that the \"storytellers\" have volunteered to be cooped up for three months in order to write their masterpieces. \"Read it at your own risk\" warns the front cover. To reveal too much would spoil the shock value. Palahniuk is an elegant storyteller with an unsurpassed appreciation of the grotesque in modern America, but Haunted offers little more than the opportunity to be knocked out in disgust. Isobel Montgomery Zorro by Isabel Allende (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99) One day, so the story goes, Isabel Allende was in her Californian house when the heirs to the legend of Zorro (or at least to the rights) knocked on her door and asked her to revive the myth of the masked crusader. Allende agreed. Not so odd when you think that the character gives her the chance to explore west coast history and recreate the freedom fighter as dashing swordsman. Her Zorro, though he is firmly \"not Che Guevara\", is a cut above the pulp hero, since he has a biography of substance - son of a Spanish landowner and Shoshone rebel-fighter mother - and a dilemma that might give any TV action hero pause for thought: after years as the swashbuckling man in the mask, our hero wonders whether there is any substance behind the image. But Allende's basic model is the picaresque retold as matinee crowd-pleaser. We hear of Zorro's exploits through the eyes of an unrequited lover, who looks on admiringly as swords flash, wrongs are righted and a few dark-eyed women provide decorative distraction. Perhaps this is as it should be - enjoyably recognisable clich\u00e9 and entertaining adventure - but the narrative ambles where it should gallop. IM Misfortune by Wesley Stace (Vintage, \u00a37.99) An abandoned baby, left for dead, is rescued by the eccentric Lord Geoffroy Loveall, who takes it back to the gothic monstrosity of Love Hall, and claims it as a replacement for the beloved baby sister he's been mourning for 20 years. The fact that the baby is a boy is a small detail to be overlooked so as to give credence to his claim to have spawned a female heir. \"Rose\" lives in blissful ignorance of her true gender for many years, except for minor forays playing at being dastardly pirate Lord Ose in games with the servants' children, and early experiments with a damsel in distress. So begins an extravagant epic that paints everything larger than life, and is saved from pure camp by a strangely believable and sensitive exploration of sexual identity and nonconformity. Drawing on the gothic excesses of Victorian literature and Dickensian caricatures of wholly repellent characters, it tackles the very modern theme of how we are shaped by our gender roles and others' expectations. In a hilariously convoluted resolution, the forces of modernity, transvestitism and self-expression triumph. A gripping read, keeping you hooked for its 500+ pages. Joanna Clarke-Jones The Red Carpet by Lavanya Sankaran (Headline, \u00a37.99) In her first book, a collection of deftly interweaving short stories, Sankaran explores the contradictions of modern Bangalore, India's silicon valley. Here the world of outsourcing and IT jostles with the traditions of the older generation to throw up a new society, its young, upwardly mobile party animals aping western values. The delicately crafted, droll tales bring to life an intermingling cast of characters who are not quite sure where they belong or how to identify themselves now many of the old barriers have broken down. In one tale, an Indian schoolgirl has Enid Blyton-esque dreams of a jolly-hockey-sticks England while learning about sex and how to keep her ayah in place. Another tells of a teenager who has grown up as a politically aware, anti-globalisation \"person of colour\" in America; she goes to India in search of her roots, only to have her preconceptions confounded at every turn by her Brahmin family. With an ear for the nuances of local language, the stories are constantly fresh and surprising. The first is perhaps the weakest, but Sankaran soon draws you into the world she creates and you won't want to leave. Definitely one to watch. JC-J Learning the World by Ken Macleod (Orbit, \u00a36.99) Macleod's 10th novel tackles a staple theme of science fiction: first contact. More than 4,000 years in the future, the inhabitants of a vast starship, But the Sky, My Lady! The Sky!, make the first ever discovery of sentient alien life, a bat-like race whose civilisation is equivalent to Earth's late 19th century. The narrative shuttles between a group of scientists on the alien world, Ground, and various members of the starship, humans radically transformed by their environment and centuries of scientific advancement. The oddity of the novel is that the aliens seem more human than the humans, a device which sets up the central conceit: how both races are changed by first contact. Macleod speculates fascinatingly on life aboard a long-haul starship and the political complexity of humankind's first encounter with aliens. The novel is rich in ideas, but lacking in characterisation and drama. If you can take the anthropomorphisation of bats and the somewhat laboured pacing, then rewards can be found in the witty playing out of high concepts and Macleod's main strength: the politicking and subterfuge of scheming races, be they human or alien.
