The nuclear power firm said it had sold some 85% of its planned output for the year to March 31 at an average \u00a331.80 per megawatt hour. In July, British Energy had fixed around 75% of its planned output for the 2005/06 financial year at an average contracted price of \u00a329.80. The company said levels could have been better were it not for problems at its Hartlepool and Heysham 1 facilities, which the firm hopes will be back to normal later next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
