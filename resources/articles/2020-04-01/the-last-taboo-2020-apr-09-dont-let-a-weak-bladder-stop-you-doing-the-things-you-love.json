Patients visit me when things have gone too far \u2013 their behaviours change and they\u2019re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they\u2019re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it\u2019s time to take action. Urinary incontinence usually affects women (up to 45% of us) after childbirth, or during the menopause. Other factors include obesity, bladder surgery, hysterectomy or neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. It\u2019s not just older people affected, either \u2013 even athletes are prone to incontinence. A Scandinavian study states that up to 80% of professional female trampolinists experience leakage. Men who have undergone surgery to treat prostate cancer can suffer, too. Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it\u2019s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn\u2019t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they\u2019d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don\u2019t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or \u201ckegels\u201d, as they\u2019re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex. When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. \u201cStress incontinence\u201d is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it\u2019s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or \u201curge incontinence\u201d, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often. Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it\u2019s really important to make sure you\u2019re doing them properly \u2013 speak to a women\u2019s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They\u2019re simple \u2013 just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast \u2013 you\u2019ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There\u2019s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises. If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key \u2013 symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great \u2013 when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too. I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women\u2019s health issues and incontinence, and it\u2019s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn\u2019t be any shame or stigma around it any more \u2013 this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve. As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.
