All my dad was doing was crying and asking me to come in.\u201d Ogden has a large family close to her father\u2019s dementia care home in Liverpool, so her father used to receive two or three visits every day. Since the visits stopped, Ogden said her father has lost weight. He doesn\u2019t understand why his family cannot visit, and he is beginning to forget who some of them are. She pays for him to have Netflix, but he seems to be sitting with the TV off whenever she calls. Ogden is one of thousands of people who have been unable to visit their loved ones during the Covid pandemic, with care homes on high alert for outbreaks of the virus. For those who have dementia, the restrictions can be impossible to understand. \u201cMy dad just says, \u2018what have I done wrong? I\u2019ve lost all my family\u2019,\u201d Ogden said. \u201cHe says that nobody cares anymore.\u201d Ogden has pleaded with care staff to allow her to visit her father, offering to pay for tests for herself every week and volunteer at the care home for free, but they have told her they are simply following regulations. \u2018We haven\u2019t been apart until now\u2019 Peter Williamson, 87, and his wife, Valerie, 85, have been married for 61 years and live in Greater Manchester. Two years ago, Valerie was diagnosed with dementia. When her health deteriorated this spring, she was taken into hospital, and shortly after, moved into a care home. Williamson hasn\u2019t seen his wife face-to-face since her admission to hospital on 13 May. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been apart until now,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried very hard to look after her, I didn\u2019t want her to go into a care home.\u201d The care home used to allow him to speak to Valerie through a partially open window, but when Greater Manchester was put into lockdown at the start of August, that stopped. \u201cI FaceTime her, which is better than nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe still recognises me, but I can see visibly that she\u2019s deteriorating. When she went into the home, she could walk, but now she has to use a wheelchair.\u201d \u201cI sometimes get a bit down and wonder if I\u2019ll ever see her again.\u201d Williamson\u2019s doctors think the stress of Valerie\u2019s move caused him to suffer a stroke, which happened during a FaceTime call to his wife, though he has since recovered. He said he thought the government\u2019s pilot scheme for relatives to be tested and given PPE to pay visits was a \u201cgood idea\u201d, but he hadn\u2019t heard anything since the announcement. \u201cIf it enables me to go to the care home, if I could sit for an hour with her, that would suit me fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve read about it, but nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d Despite being unable to go inside, Williamson calls the care home every day to ask how is wife is, and delivers flowers each weekend to make sure Valerie doesn\u2019t forget him. \u201cSometimes she thinks she\u2019s in a prison, and other times on a holiday in a hotel, and she asks why I can\u2019t come to stay, and why I have to go away, and that hurts a bit really,\u201d he said. \u201cI give her the flowers to have something to remember me by. I don\u2019t like her to forget me.\u201d \u2018He needs to know he is loved and cherished\u2019 Before lockdown, Carole Quirke, 76, visited her husband, Barry, who turns 79 on Thursday, at his care home in Wiltshire about four times a week. The couple have been together for 27 years, and Barry was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia in 2014. At the start of lockdown, during window visits, Quirke would play his favourite music from the 1960s, and Barry would tap his feet and try to dance. Now, he does not react to the music, and has lost the ability to speak. \u201cHis life is about quality not quantity of time now,\u201d said Quirke. \u201cHe is very ill, I know he is dying. He needs to know he is loved and cherished before he leaves.\u201d Quirke described the government\u2019s pilot scheme announcement as \u201ca PR stunt\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a pilot, you just do it, that\u2019s all we\u2019re asking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to put that in place, just start the testing. That\u2019s all I\u2019d love to do, is to go and help him and make him feel I\u2019m there.\u201d Last week, Barry and another resident tested positive, and on a second test, negative, for coronavirus. Quirke has been told that due to regulations, the care home must shut for a month, even to window visits. She is also worried about the impact a second lockdown will have, and said the situation has \u201cfloored\u201d her. \u201cWhen he was still lucid, I promised him I wouldn\u2019t leave him alone with this disease,\u201d she said. \u201cI can feel he\u2019s there and he needs comfort. I\u2019ve said to the care home that if there\u2019s any way around this, I\u2019ll do it. I would just like a month of warmth for Barry before he goes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
