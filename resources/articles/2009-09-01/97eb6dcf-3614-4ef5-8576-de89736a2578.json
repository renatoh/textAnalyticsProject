After today's bleak Treasury predictions for the imminent squeeze on the public finances, leaked by the Tories themselves, a better question might be: \"Who would want to win the next election and have to clean up this mess?\" Elected politicians are made of sterner stuff, convinced that they can make a difference. Neil Kinnock always said that, had he won in 1992, he would have sought an immediate devaluation of sterling, thus avoiding John Major's fatal humiliation on Black Wednesday. None of them fight to lose, especially not the competitive Cameron. Though otherwise full of self-doubt, Gordon Brown also remains convinced that his vast economic experience makes him the man to steer Britain to safety. Polls suggest that most voters now disagree, trusting the Tories more to reduce the deficit while protecting public services like the NHS. Today's renewed charges that Brown has lacked candour \u2013 again \u2013 about the urgent need for cuts may reinforce that impression, though most of the Brown quotes on the Tory charge sheet have wriggle room. Downing Street is not \"ideologically\" committed to 10% cuts as eager Tories are. Brown does not \"want\" to make cuts. But he will. So how could Cameron blow it? Labour's slender hope lies in the conviction that voters outside the M25 will rumble Cameron and his sidekick, George Osborne, as slick, well-fed metropolitans. Such hope echoes Labour belief in 1979 that Margaret Thatcher, widely feared by voters, would make some gaffe that destroyed her. It never remotely happened. Thatcher and her manifesto were cautious. Even so she won a middling majority of just 43 seats: the landslide came in 1983. But 1979 was a sea-change election of the kind Britain rarely sees and has not done since. Nor will 2010 be such an occasion. The public mood is angry but also cautious. What Treasury leak shows is that, whoever wins the election will have to trim the budget even more sharply than the small print of Alistair Darling's March plans \u2013 not 7% of national income, or 8% (Vince Cable's proposal), but 9% or more: \u00a3110bn or more by 2014. There has been nothing like it since Labour's IMF loan crisis of 1976 \u2013 virtually a full reversal of the extra public spending since 1997. That, not charges of \"liar,\" is the really serious blow to Brown's reputation. Cameron and Osborne have not been candid either, but nor was Brown in opposition. The issue now is the timing and speed of cuts, and the balance between higher taxes and lower spending \u2013 between \"wise\" cuts and reckless ones that imperil recovery, as Lord Mandelson put it. Today'sleak suggests some Whitehall officials favour the Tory timetable: start cutting now. Cameron knows many voters are wary, that the electoral system favours Labour (Tory votes pile up in safe seats) and that smaller parties of both left and right are growing in strength. The Cable factor may help save Liberal Democrat seats from the expected Tory surge. Where Cameron may be vulnerable lies in his failure to tame his own right wing as Blair tamed the left. He has appeased, but not satisfied it. Their influence is magnified by the vocal Tory internet presence, always impossible to manage. Labour monitors it carefully. Does it all point to another cautious 1979-style mandate?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
