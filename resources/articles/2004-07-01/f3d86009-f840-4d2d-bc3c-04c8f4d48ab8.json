There's a melee outside his office; key officials jostle for a quick, urgent word with Professor Sir Bob. May is a busy man. Halfway through his presidency, he has achieved much, but there is plenty more to do to guide Britain's oldest scientific establishment. May has instilled a new sense of political awareness in the society. But he is self-deprecating, describing it simply as \"all part of the changing temper of the times\". He sees it as an evolutionary change; not particularly dramatic. \"The aim has always been to affect policy. It's just, I think, learning by doing, and the more deliberate focus on how you use science advice in policy-making in government that began in 1996 with John Major's guidelines,\" May explains. For him, Professor Sir David King, the government's current chief scientific adviser, has carried this on well in his quest to appoint external science advisers to review each government department. May is not shy in praising his peers, citing several examples of others' sterling work throughout the interview. But despite May's protestations, it is clear that with him at the helm, the Royal Society has been steered into more political waters. Perhaps because of his five years spent close to the inner workings of government as its chief scientific adviser and head of the Office of Science and Technology, he has lent a more political presence. And this has been rewarded with the government's ear and attention. For example, after the foot and mouth disease crisis, the society was gearing up to conduct its own study into infectious diseases in livestock, when the government approached the society to do a similar study on its behalf. According to May, this was a first. \"While many of the earlier reports aimed to be influential, and we had been having good interaction with them on some of them, this was the first time we'd actually been approached by the government offering to pay for the report.\" May gave this careful consideration, he says - in particular, the degree to which taking the money to do the report would in any sense compromise the society's independence. \"But on the whole we saw no problem with this, provided, as was clear, that it was done to a job description we constructed and we published whatever findings were to emerge.\" That report, like many of the others, began with a public consultation and concluded that reactive vaccination against the strain that had been identified might play a larger part in future action. As a direct result of the report, EU regulations were changed in the way the society's report recommended. Its influence extended to the Lords, where it was reflected in the amendments to the animal health bill. May also pushed the society into the political fray earlier in the year, with an attempt to spark debate on the dual-support system of research funding in the UK, whereby universities receive government money via both the research councils and the funding councils. But it was ultimately futile. Both the higher education minister, Alan Johnson, and the science minister, David Sainsbury, reacted by publicly plumping for dual support. This May blames on misunderstanding. \"What we were suggesting was whether the way we go about funding them so separately and distinctly, unlike any other comparable country, ought to be looked at,\" he explains, rather than getting rid of dual support altogether. Was he disappointed? No. Introducing top-up fees was an issue exercising the sector more at the time and May never expected anything to happen in a hurry, he says. \"We were very consciously and deliberately suggesting we ought to be starting a debate that looks beyond the next RAE.\" Stopping before the 2008 research assessment exercise and reconsidering would be like \"turning round a tanker\", he says. May was widely criticised for attempting to initiate the research funding debate without putting forward any alternative models. But, again, this was a deliberate move on his part. \"It would be hard enough to get people to really think at first principles about a radical reshaping of how you handle this. If at the same time we said 'here's the Royal Society's view of how it should be done,' the whole debate would have been focused on whether our way was a good idea.\" May, an Australian physicist and ecologist, also has extensive experience of the US system, having spent 11 years at Princeton University. This leads to unfavourable comparisons with the UK system of research funding. It would be fair to say, for instance, that May is no big fan of the research assessment exercise: \"It stifles research creativity.\" He is, however, very keen on citation analysis. And it was by looking at citations on multidisciplinary research that he realised the UK is above average in this type of collaborative research. But, he maintains, the RAE is not helping. \"Britain is very good at basic science. It suits the tolerance of eccentricity, the 'let young people get on with it' spirit. That spirit encourages people doing unusual things and crossing boundaries and it shows in the bibliometric indices. Conversely, however, the RAE, as it has become increasingly rigidly interpreted, partly by the funding councils but even more simply by the way universities respond to it, inhibits it.\" He also deplores the \"one-dimensional totem pole of esteem that is focused on research\", which he says the RAE has helped to develop. \"It's creating a culture in this country where it's seen almost to be a status symbol to not teach undergraduates. That's not good for undergraduates but it's even worse for the researchers. \"And you wouldn't get it at Princeton. The idea that this is making it like Ivy League universities is completely mistaken. The teaching loads of those places is significantly greater than the teaching loads at places such as Oxford and Cambridge.\" May is equally dubious about the government's plans to implement a full-cost regime to put research on a more sustainable footing. \"Looking at it from a detached level, I find a bunch of people who are career civil servants, who know very little of the world they are looking at, who have produced a set of rules which, in my opinion, are little short of lunatic in their notion that that which in the States is recognised as a time-consuming, difficult attribution of costs at the level of institution, which then is applied to each grant, should here be done at the level of each grant? Kafka couldn't have dreamed this up!\" One of the UK's great strengths up to now has been to say \"here's the money, take it and use it wisely\", he says. \"It has not been prescriptive. The growing investment has inescapably been matched by growing bureaucracy and there are things to be worried about at the edge of that.\" With another couple of years in post and two annual addresses to go, one hopes May will continue to keep his opinions, and those of the science community, right at the heart of political debate, where they belong.
