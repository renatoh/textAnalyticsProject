This conceit risks some potentially inflammatory misunderstandings. Yesterday, for example, readers could have been forgiven for thinking that the gambling culture among England players is alive and well in Germany. In a posting dated June 16, Owen states that gambling with team-mates has helped him avoid boredom. \"If everyone is quietly passing the time in their rooms playing on their computer or reading then I get really bored. But if everyone is in the games room playing cards or pool, or if everyone is in the same television room watching the match, shouting and betting with each other, then I'm fine.\" In fact it is the readers who are the mug punters. After an agreement with Sven-Goran Eriksson that squad members would not do newspaper columns during the tournament, Owen recorded all his \"diary\" pieces four weeks ago, crucially before signing a Fifa agreement outlawing gambling on the World Cup by players. A spokesman for the Football Association said that no gambling was taking place at the squad headquarters near Baden-Baden. Even if it were, Fifa would not take any action. \"Only when gambling reaches a professional or institutional level will we act,\" said a spokesman. \"A small bet between players is not a problem.\" Readers of Michael Owen's online diary at msn.com are being seriously short-changed, with entries that purport to be live having in fact been recorded weeks ago.

One goalmouth was quickly cordoned off to prevent further damage to a surface already notable for several bare patches, and if the thundery weather continues there may even be the first sighting of mud on a player's knee. Bars and bugs for Wags The burghers of Baden-Baden continue to stitch up the England squad and their accompanying Wags (wives and girlfriends) at every opportunity. Despite the distaff side of Team England spending thousands of euros in the boutiques and bars, every detail is appearing in the local and international media. The best-selling German tabloid Bild published a spending league table yesterday, topped not surprisingly by Coleen McLoughlin. The locals may be the least of their worries: an FA source said yesterday that two journalists were thrown out of the Wags' hotel at the weekend after attempting to use hidden cameras and bugging devices. Tickets to a quick exit Ismail Bhamjee may become that rarest of birds, a Fifa executive member who loses his job. The Botswanan was sent home from Germany after being caught touting his personal ticket allocation and, having upset most of the Southern African federation's key figures, Cosafa's president is likely to pay the price. Jack Warner, Fifa's vice-president, has no such worries. He ensured that all Trinidad's official tickets were distributed via his family-owned travel business but kept his place on Fifa's executive by resigning from the firm.
