That is how much the International Association of Athletics Federations has decided the Londoner earned illegally during the period from 2002 and 2003 when he was using Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) given to him by Victor Conte, the founder and owner of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative. They have reached the figure after studying prize money the European 100 metres champion won and also by consulting meeting directors across Europe about what they paid him to appear in their meetings. Chambers has officially completed his two-year suspension but will be unable to return until he has agreed a schedule to repay the money. The IAAF is willing to accept repayment in instalments but how quickly Chambers can discharge the debt will depend on how much money he earns upon his return. Chambers had admitted to the BBC last December that he had taken banned drugs. He added that he was broke and that one of his motivations for returning - having said in the immediate aftermath of his ban in February 2004 that he would never run again - was earning enough money to help support his baby son, Sky. He hopes to make his first major appearance at the British grand prix in Gateshead on June 11 against the co-world record holders Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin but is unlikely to receive any appearance fee from Fast Track, the organisers. A good performance there, however, will make him attractive to meeting directors across Europe and if he rediscovers his sub-10 second form he will worth as much as \u00a350,000 per event. His past will not be easy to outrun, however, and his next humiliation could see him stripped of the European 100m title he won in Munich four years ago, a performance he now admits was achieved with the aid of banned drugs. But those who have seen him training in Jamaica have claimed he is \"flying\" and predict he will win the European title in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
