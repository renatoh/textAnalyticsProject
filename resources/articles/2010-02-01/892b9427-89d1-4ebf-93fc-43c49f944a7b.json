The relative parsimony of this January's spending does not mean that Premier League clubs are in financial meltdown, although, clearly, the climate has turned chilly. Portsmouth are the extreme case, a club embargoed by the Premier League for much of January from making any signings because they still owe instalments on players signed in 2007 who have since departed. Hull City's auditors have stated publicly that the club must reduce its costs by \u00a316m even if Phil Brown's men survive in the Premier League, so chairman Adam Pearson's balancing act has been to decide which players can be retained so City might have a chance of doing both. It is generally accepted that a sudden realisation of the need to end their never-never profligacy has thudded into most clubs below the biggest. Hull and Portsmouth both borrowed against future television income, and Standard Bank's demands to have all the money repaid precipitated Pompey's near-collapse. Several senior Premier League figures said that banks have reined in their lending to football clubs. While transfer fees and new signings are falling as a result, there is no sign, according to one chairman, that players' wage inflation is even slowing. Steve Morgan, the Wolves chairman, who has kept a check on spending despite the club's promotion windfall, said: \"In football and generally in business banks are not backing people to extend themselves against future earnings. That is the new realism. Football is having to realise we can't keep living beyond our means, and hocking the future to pay for the present.\" The imminence of next season's Uefa-inspired rule limiting squads to 25, of whom eight must be \"homegrown\" players, is encouraging even stable Premier League clubs, or those with still willing owners, to offload players, not sign more. In the move to encourage opportunities for young players, unlimited numbers of those aged under 21 are allowed to supplement the 25, and that partly explains this window's most eye-catching deal, Manchester United's \u00a310.7m signing of the 20-year-old centre-half Chris Smalling, who has played just 11 first-team matches for Fulham. United's chief executive, David Gill, insisted at the weekend that Sir Alex Ferguson does have the proceeds of Cristiano Ronaldo's sale to spend, despite the club's \u00a3716m debts and \u00a3500m bond prospectus, which gave United licence to use \u00a370m to reduce the money owed to hedge funds by the owners, the Glazer family. Liverpool, the other club subjected to a leveraged buyout by American owners who shifted their own borrowings on to the club, have made it clear there is not much spare cash for the manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez to shop for players with. Standing apart from the rest are two clubs who remain undeniably rich. Yet Chelsea have spent nothing, their Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, signalling that he really would like to make good his pledge to one day break even financially at Stamford Bridge. At Manchester City, Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi is not suddenly poor. Unlike the Glazers at Old Trafford, he is not thought to be personally borrowing money from his club, yet even City have not been lavish. Last January City spent \u00a344.5m buying Shay Given, Wayne Bridge, Craig Bellamy and Nigel de Jong but, after another spree in the summer, the club stated they would not be similarly acquisitive this time. Their new manager, Roberto Mancini, has had to content himself with adding only Patrick Vieira and Adam Johnson, who joined Middlesbrough yesterday, to the costly squad he inherited. Tottenham were last January's other big spenders, \u00a348m furnishing Harry Redknapp with Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane and Wilson Palacios, plus Carlo Cudicini, on a free transfer, and Pascal Chimbonda for an undisclosed fee. Spurs fans, and players, must hope the club has the backing to pay the ongoing bills rather more reliably than Redknapp's previous club, Portsmouth. The Premier League clubs, mostly, seem to have suddenly realised they cannot keep borrowing and spending, to fuel rampant transfer inflation. Then there is Arsenal, the one club to have generated a large pot of cash, have a manager who resolutely, for reasons of principle, is declining to spend it. Mostly, however, the Premier League clubs have suddenly realised they cannot keep borrowing and spending to fuel rampant transfer inflation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
