On November 21, the station will instead host discussions and interviews about music and our relationship with it, as part of No Music Day, the brainchild of musician and KLF co-founder Bill Drummond. What began as a personal choice for Drummond five years ago has gone nationwide via his website, nomusicday.com. Last year, Resonance Radio in London's Denmark Street, the home of Britain's music publishing business, went silent to mark the day; next year, Drummond is planning a programme of film screenings stripped of their musical scores. \"It isn't that I am anti-music,\" Drummond says. \"It's more about wanting to create a break from it. My ideal would be for iTunes to shut up shop for the day, but I'm not sure they would consider it such an attractive business proposition.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
