The head of the pilot project, Carol Dezateaux, of the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, said the results were encouraging and were awaiting publication in a peer-reviewed journal. A final decision on whether to include the screen in a standard blood test that all babies receive would be taken in the autumn, but she said the tests had proved to be \"clinically beneficial\" and hinted strongly that they would be extended. The disease, Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD), affects around 70 babies born each year and prevents them from accessing fat stores in the body. It can result in sudden illness or death if not recognised early, but can be treated with a careful diet. If adopted, the test will be added to the newborn blood-spot screening programme that is carried out on nearly every baby born in the UK. It involves collecting blood from a pinprick on the baby's heel at one week old. The scheme started in the 60s and has since been extended to cover several genetic disorders. Testing for cystic fibrosis, which affects around 280 babies a year, is currently being introduced in England; it is already carried out in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
