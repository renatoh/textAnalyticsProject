Youngsters entering the St Elli retail complex in Llanelli are being asked to remove the footwear, as managers claim older customers risk being knocked down by wheelie youths. As a result, some youngsters have had to walk around the complex in their socks after being spotted by security guards. Gilmour Jones, centre manager, said: \"For many years we have had rules against using roller blades or skateboards in the centre.\" Press Association Islands may pay women to stay and raise birthrate Women could be given financial incentives to stay on a remote group of Scottish islands facing a population crisis. Western Isles council is considering offering women financial inducements, including subsidised housing and grants, to stop them moving to the mainland. The details are contained in a report commissioned by the council, which predicts a 23% drop in the number of women of child-bearing age by 2019. Experts said the islands needed to stop about 40 women and 20 men from leaving every year. The islands' population has fallen by about 40% between 1901 and 2001.

The haul, reported in today's British Archaeology, included an 1850s Enfield musket, Boer war guns, and 30 late 19th century Martini-Henrys, the type issued in the 1879 Zulu war. Some are assumed to have come from the police armoury and others to have been handed in when such trophies were made illegal in 1926.
