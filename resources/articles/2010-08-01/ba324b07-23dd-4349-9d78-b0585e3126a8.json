Having elbowed aside the favourite (Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon) and the stalking horse (Jacques Audiard's A Prophet) to win last year's Oscar for Best Foreign Film, Campanella's relatively unlauded entry has a lot to live up to. But thankfully it delivers, being a handsome, smart, adult mystery, in which a retired legal counsellor (Dar\u00edn) delves into the past to deal with an unresolved murder case. The surprise is not so much that it won the Oscar but how much it resembles the classy, sexually charged Hollywood thrillers of the 70s and 80s, from Klute to Sea Of Love. Maybe if Tom Cruise made films like this instead of the gormless Knight And Day he might reconnect with his grown-up fanbase. But then, the studios are too busy kowtowing to the idiotic teenage demographic to let him. Black Dynamite (15) (Scott Sanders, 2009, US) Michael Jai White, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Arsenio Hall. 84 mins. Movie spoofs are mostly a blight, but this affectionate tribute to blaxploitation is a hilarious delight. Star White perfectly channels Shaft's po-faced 70s vibe, while director Sanders spins a crazy, Airplane!-style yarn that takes his private dick from the ghetto to the White House via the notorious Kung-Fu Island. The Final (18) (Joey Stewart, 2010, US) Marc Donato, Jascha Washington, Whitney Hoy. 93 mins. Humdrum, moralistic spin on torture porn, in which bullied high-school kids turn the tables on their teenage tormentors. Five Easy Pieces (15) (Bob Rafelson, 1970, US) Jack Nicholson, Karen Black, Fannie Flagg. 98 mins. Reissue of Nicholson's breakout movie, in which he plays a disillusioned upper-class dropout who turns his back on a musical career to work on an oil rig. The Last Airbender (PG) (M Night Shyamalan, 2010, US) Noah Ringer, Dev Patel, Nicola Peltz. 103 mins. The ignominious decline of one-time Hollywood golden boy Shyamalan continues with this badly acted, badly written and badly rendered futuristic 3D fantasy, in which a young boy is found to have control over all the elements. How its now shop-soiled director will recover \u2013 having struck out with a third stinker in a row following the dismal one-two of Lady In The Water and The Happening \u2013 is really anyone's guess. Le Refuge (15) (Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, 2009, Fr) Isabelle Carr\u00e9, Louis-Ronan Choisy, Melvil Poupaud. 88 mins. Minor-key, odd-buddy romance, in which a former heroin addict (Carr\u00e9) strikes up an unusual affair with her dead lover's gay brother (French singer-songwriter Choisy). The performances, and especially the music, are very good indeed, but the story is slight and Ozon has been much better and bolder in the past. Tinkerbell And The Great Fairy Rescue (U) (Bradley Raymond, 2010, US) Mae Whitman, Michael Sheen, Lucy Liu. 75 mins. Children too young to face the traumas of Toy Story 3 might prefer this lighter animated adventure, in which Tinkerbell befriends a human child and causes ructions in the fairy world. Out next week Marmaduke Live-action Great Dane family flick. Out on Wednesday The Expendables Sly Stallone's testosterone-packed all-star action epic. Out on Thursday The Human Centipede (First Sequence) Gruesome cult horror, based on dubious medical fact. The Illusionist French animation based on a lost Tati script. Mother South Korean murder-mystery about a crime-solving mum. Pianomania Austrian documentary about a perfectionist piano tuner. Piranha Fishy 3D pulp-horror, starring Kelly Brook in a swimsuit. Salt Flashy 2D pulp-thriller, starring Angelina Jolie in a catsuit.
