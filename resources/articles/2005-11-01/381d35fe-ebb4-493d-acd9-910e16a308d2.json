It meant only a bizarre sequence of results can prevent Davenport from assuming the pinnacle, or from reaching at least the semi-finals of the WTA Championships. And if Davenport regains the title here it will make her the highest woman earner of all time. One does not think of the affable Californian with the one-dimensional game as being in the same league as Steffi Graf or Martina Navratilova, but these are the people she will overtake if she triumphs on Sunday. That would earn $1m first prize and take her career total beyond the$21m-plus those two won. All that without Davenport having won a grand slam for 5\u00bd years. Kim Clijsters' 6-3, 7-6 defeat by Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo was her first by the French player in their past eight meetings. The Belgian played some admirable rallies on an unexpectedly quick surface and fought hard, saving two match points in while recovering from 3-5 to 6-5 in the second set. But when it most mattered, she was pressured into error. \"I wish I could have played a little better but I am not the only player on the tour,\" Clijsters said. \"I've won a lot of tournaments and matches this year. Maybe it's time for some other girls to do the same,\" she said. Neither Graf nor Navratilova would have said that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
