So tight, in fact, the winners will feel more like exhausted potholers stumbling out into the light unless a pair of muscular packs and two skinflint defences declare an Easter holiday truce. With the stakes so high, that seems a forlorn prospect. These two heavyweight sides are effectively enemies joined at the hip, Gloucester's director of rugby Nigel Melville having spent half his sporting life at Wasps before relocating over the Cotswolds. Few defensive gurus, either, instil a more confrontational brand of northern grit than Shaun Edwards and Dave Ellis. \"We're not planning to stand back and applaud them,\" growled Edwards, asked whether the pace on Gloucester's flanks worried him. If the ball does ever reach the wide men, a phalanx of committed defenders will be riding shotgun. So where does all this leave a luminously subtle talent such as James Simpson-Daniel, a gifted artiste trapped in a rollerball world? If ever there was a day crying out for a shaft of brilliance from the Gloucester and England wing this is surely it; the Cherry and Whites have never won at the Causeway Stadium and the memory of their heavy defeat to Wasps in last season's Zurich Championship final still lingers. Simpson-Daniel has also had a season punctuated with frustration, unluckily missing out on World Cup selection and making only a cameo Six Nations appearance against Ireland following a rib injury. Last week's league game at Saracens was his first start for Gloucester since January and \"rusty\" was Melville's blunt midweek assessment of the 21-year-old's contribution. A certain amount of pressure, in other words, rests on the golden boy they call Sinbad. When he famously ran around Jonah Lomu in the Barbarians game at Twickenham two years ago, there was not a scintilla of doubt England had unearthed a new starlet. His subsequent total of six caps and one Test try, however, has again proved that talent without good fortune is useless beauty. Ever since the untimely bout of glandular fever that ended his Twickenham honeymoon 17 months ago, the confidence of youth has had to be infused with a reluctant streak of realism. Simpson-Daniel has always been an impatient patient - \"I hate being injured with a passion. I just can't watch matches; it does my head in\" - and life on the periphery has been tougher than active involvement on the wing. \"I get even more nervous when I'm sat on the bench waiting to find out whether they want me or not. But I've managed to keep myself sane. Of course I wanted to start for England but I can't spit my dummy that I'm not ahead of Ben Cohen, Josh Lewsey or Jason Robinson. I've just got to prove I can play better than one of them.\" To outwit Lewsey tomorrow will require more ball than he saw against Saracens - \"We didn't play much rugby. . . hopefully the rest of the season won't be like that\" - in order to rediscover the gambling instinct that underpins his other great love, horse racing. On that front, the omens are not great. \"On the Thursday of the Cheltenham Festival I had a bet on every race and not one penny came back to me. I may as well have gone straight up to the bookies, given them my \u00a3100 and walked out.\" The born risk-taker, though, always bounces back. Simpson-Daniel's dream - \"It will happen; it's just a question of when\" - is to buy a top-quality two-year-old and name it after Nick Duncombe, his friend and fellow England squad member who died last year before the pair could fulfil their plan to buy a horse together. Simpson-Daniel's current four-legged interest is a three-year-old called Leitrim Rock, which, coincidentally, is back in action in the 5.05 at Warwick on Easter Monday after a lengthy lay-off. The co-owner is not getting over-excited - \"We're not hopeful; he just needs a run\" - but an air of caution is less evident when English rugby's most promising young thoroughbred assesses his own prospects. \"Maybe I am lacking a little bit of match practice but I don't think I'd call myself rusty. I feel good. I feel confident. My school coach at Sedbergh, Neil Rollings, always used to say there is a fine line between success and failure and I totally agree. It's about having the confidence to chuck that little flick pass that could win you the game. It's just a case of identifying when it's worth trying. The second you go out there and try and do what the average person does. . . well, that's just being solid. You want to try something different, out of the ordinary.\" Watching him drive off in his sporty BMW soft-top with personalised number plates to his newly purchased house on Cleeve Hill overlooking Cheltenham racecourse is to suspect dull conformity will never be Simpson-Daniel's style. Judging by the dressing-room abuse he receives, certain gnarled Gloucester forwards clearly feel their fresh-faced little comrade has it easy. Should he resurrect Gloucester's season with one magical flash tomorrow, his tormentors will soon change their tune. Where the match will be won and lost Craig Dowd v Phil Vickery Worth the admittance price alone to see how England's tight-head prop fares against one of New Zealand's finest exports. If Gloucester are to gain a foothold away from home, their first task is to match Wasps' big men up front and pressurise them at the set-pieces. Simon Shaw v Alex Brown Two gentlemanly England second-row candidates, two very different players. Shaw's rumbling ability in the loose is a key ingredient in Wasps' game plan but Brown is the rising star of English lineout play. No one around the country this season has claimed more ball or stolen more opposition throws, and the ex-Bristol lock is deceptively influential. Rob Howley v Andy Gomarsall Gomarsall started his career at Wasps playing behind Lawrence Dallaglio and co and knows precisely what to expect. Howley, at his best, is a supreme No9 and Gloucester will be in trouble if the Welshman provides his fly-half Alex King with an armchair ride. Stuart Abbott v Henry Paul The Wasps midfield will race up on Paul, aiming to reduce what assistant coach Shaun Edwards calls the \"think time\" of his former Wigan colleague and neutralise Gloucester's threat out wide. It was Abbott's slashing early break that set the tone for Wasps' 39-3 romp over Gloucester in the Zurich Championship final last May.
