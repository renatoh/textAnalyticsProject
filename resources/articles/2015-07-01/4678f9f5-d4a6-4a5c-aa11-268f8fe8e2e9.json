Judges for the \u00a3100,000 Art Fund prize said the Whitworth had cemented its place as the centre of the cultural national stage. Stephen Deuchar, the director of the Art Fund who chaired the judges, said: \u201cThe transformation of the Whitworth \u2013 architecturally, curatorially, and as a destination \u2013 has been one of the great museum achievements of recent years.\u201d He praised the galleries, the collections, the community engagement, and the visitor experience. \u201cAnd in a wider sense, the Whitworth has changed the landscape; it truly feels like a museum of the future.\u201d The Whitworth opened its doors 126 years ago supported by 60 eminent Mancunians, including CP Scott, the Manchester Guardian editor and the man who came up with the phrase: \u201cComment is free, but facts are sacred.\u201d The gallery\u2019s one aim was to act for \u201cthe perpetual gratification of the people of Manchester\u201d. By 1908, it had world class collections of British watercolours and drawings, 266 given by Manchester Guardian owner, John Edward Taylor, and textiles. It has added enviable holdings of modern art and wallpapers since then. It was the first public collection to buy a Picasso, in 1922, and by the late 1960s, as it championed artists such as David Hockney, it was being nicknamed \u201cthe Tate of the north\u201d. The gallery closed for redevelopment in the autumn of 2013 and reopened in February of last year \u2013 transformed. Judges for the prize said its \u201creinvention \u2026 has redefined the way it engages with its public\u201d, citing the connection between the building and surrounding park to create a space with a strong sense of openness and invitation. \u201cIt is a truly modern building that has established its place at the heart of the city.\u201d They also praised the team leading it, not least its dynamic director Maria Balshaw who took charge in 2006 and also leads Manchester Art Gallery in the city centre. The prize was presented by the poet and novelist, Ben Okri, after a dinner at London\u2019s Tate Modern. The shortlisted organisations who missed out were: The MAC in Belfast, the Tower of London, the Imperial War Museum in London, Oxford University\u2019s Museum of Natural History, and the National Trust property Dunham Massey near Altrincham. The prize is the biggest museum prize in the world and the largest arts award in Britain. Previous winners range from the enormous, the British Museum in 2011, to the small, for example the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, London, in 2013. Last year\u2019s winner was the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Judges for the prize this year were the artist Michael Landy, the design critic and writer, Alice Rawsthorn, the journalist Fiammetta Rocco, and the director of the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, Axel R\u00fcger. For the first time, a photography competition was also organised to run with the main prize.
