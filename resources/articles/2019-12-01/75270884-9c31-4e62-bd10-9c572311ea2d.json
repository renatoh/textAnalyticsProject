In a wide-ranging interview, Corbyn said he thought Labour had \u201cgot the message out\u201d across the six-week campaign and rejected calls to encourage tactical voting to defeat Boris Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m feeling very happy, very confident,\u201d he told the Guardian en route from a rally in Bristol city centre to a noisy public meeting at football club Forest Green Rovers, near Stroud. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the message out, and we will continue to make sure it gets out over these last few days. And fundamentally, the choice is: do you have hope and investment for the future, or do you go down the market road with the Tories?\u201d Asked whether it had been the right approach to pour activists and resources into winning Tory-held seats, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been to 60-something seats already. Most of them are offensive marginals, where we\u2019re trying to win them. I haven\u2019t been to that many places that we\u2019re defending, but I want to support colleagues who\u2019ve done a great job \u2013 so I went to Crewe to support Laura Smith, we\u2019re going to Stroud to support David Drew. But most of the places we\u2019ve been to are places we\u2019re going to win.\u201d He acknowledged concerns about what he called Labour\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d manifesto, which some candidates have complained is so packed with consumer giveaways that many voters are baffled. \u201cAs the manifesto was being put together, I was one who was always cautious about an overlong manifesto,\u201d he said. But he pointed to the \u201centhusiasm of people to write it\u201d and the need to set out Labour\u2019s policies in detail on issues including the environment. \u201cI think it\u2019s right to do that,\u201d he added. With just two more days of campaigning to go, Boris Johnson\u2019s party retains a comfortable lead in most polls, despite questions over whether Johnson\u2019s \u201cget Brexit done\u201d slogan dramatically underplays the challenges looming in 2020. Labour\u2019s most likely route to government on Friday is with the cooperation of other, smaller parties. But Corbyn rejected the idea that voters should vote tactically for the best-placed candidate to beat the Conservatives. Asked about it, he simply repeated, \u201cI would encourage people to vote Labour. I would encourage people to vote Labour.\u201d Challenged about whether he is good at reaching out beyond Labour\u2019s loyal base, to win over ex-Tory voters, Corbyn said: \u201cI do my best to. I\u2019ve been a member of parliament for a very long time, I\u2019ve travelled around this country for years, and I\u2019ve got a love and an understanding of this country and the brilliant bits of local history and diversity that we have. And I love it.\u201d Labour\u2019s appeal during the campaign has sometimes appeared to be a moral one \u2013 to voters\u2019 social responsibility, more than to their pockets. But Corbyn insisted that the party\u2019s message was altruistic as well as practical. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d He added: \u201cI meet people in reasonable jobs, in middle age, who thought life was getting stable for them and they were doing OK, and suddenly in their late 40s and 50s they are having to borrow money to put their kids through uni, or watch their kids get into debt. Or they\u2019re having to give up work to look after elderly parents who need social care. They\u2019re actually paying the price for austerity as much as those children living in poverty.\u201d Asked how he would appeal to leave voters, Corbyn was keen to highlight the fact that Labour\u2019s new Brexit deal, which he has promised to secure within three months, would be negotiated by a \u201cbalanced\u201d team. That suggests Sir Keir Starmer, who has been shadow Brexit secretary for three years, would find himself accompanied by at least one leave supporter, perhaps from a seat outside London. Some of Corbyn\u2019s supporters have complained that the party\u2019s stance has skewed too much towards remain in the past 12 months, in a way that has prejudiced its chances in seats in the Midlands and the north. Corbyn said: \u201cI say to those people who voted leave, I\u2019m sure you voted leave for many, many reasons, but I doubt you voted leave to see our manufacturing industry decimated or the protections and rights we have at work damaged. We\u2019ll put that choice before the people of this country.\u201d He refused to engage with questions about whether he would step down on Friday if Labour fails to deprive Johnson of a majority. \u201cWe\u2019re intending to win on Thursday, so the question doesn\u2019t arise,\u201d he said. Many party insiders are openly speculating about who could succeed Corbyn. Several potential leftwing successors, including Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Laura Pidcock, have taken prominent roles in the campaign. Other possible candidates who have embraced a remain stance, including Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have been allowed little presence, amid fears among Labour strategists of Brexit voters being deterred. One approach mooted at the party\u2019s conference in September was that Corbyn\u2019s old ally John McDonnell could take over as an interim leader, after a rule change made by Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee that was overshadowed at the time by the failed putsch against Tom Watson. A contest for the deputy leadership is already looming in the coming months, after Watson announced that he would not stand again for parliament. His former seat, West Bromwich East, is among those that Labour fears could be at risk on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
