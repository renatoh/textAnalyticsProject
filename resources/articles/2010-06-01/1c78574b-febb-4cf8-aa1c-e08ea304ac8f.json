According to an investigation, David Hartnett, the permanent secretary for tax at HM Revenue and Customs, accepted invitations to eat and drink 107 times over the past three years. Prominent among those extending corporate largesse were the top accountancy firms, which are paid by big business to find ways of avoiding paying tax. Hartnett, 59, who lists his recreations as food and wine in Who's Who, has been accused of being too cosy with large corporations. He emerged top of the league in an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a not-for-profit body based at City University London, which collated more than 3,000 instances of hospitality given to top civil servants in the past three years. Hartnett sat down with representatives of the \"big four\" accountancy firms 27 times. He ate with KPMG 10 times and went to one reception. He also accepted hospitality from PricewaterhouseCoopers seven times, Ernst &amp; Young four times and Deloitte three. Last September he clocked up four dinners, two lunches and two breakfasts paid for by, among others, unnamed private equity chief executives, PWC and KMPG. On 17 September he had breakfast courtesy of the now merged City firms JP Morgan and Cazenove, followed by lunch the same day with accountants from BDO Stoy Hayward. Corporate hospitality is part of Hartnett's approach to raising tax from big firms. Rather than confronting them, he has relied on persuading them to pay their share of tax. HMRC said Hartnett engages with \"people from all sectors of the economy in meetings which take place inside and outside office hours. The relationships that Dave has forged have enabled HMRC to transform its relationships with business and other taxpayers. This has made a significant contribution to the increased tax yield HMRC has achieved in the period.\" HMRC denied Hartnett had received too much hospitality from the accountancy firms: \"If you are a jockey, you have got to get on to the racecourse.\" The code also states: \"Civil servants must not accept gifts or hospitality or receive other benefits from anyone which might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity.\" This includes the \"suspicion of perceived or actual conflicts of interests\". Overall in the study, the most frequent hosts include management consultants who have secured hundreds of contracts across government, representatives of big business, and the arms industry. They include KPMG, PWC, Fujitsu, CBI, Deloitte, IBM, Ernst &amp; Young, The Chemistry Club, BT and BAE. Permanent secretaries are registered as attending everything from black-tie events to barbecues. They enjoyed 1,257 dinners, 675 lunches, 165 breakfasts, 10 free tickets to the Chelsea flower show, nine tickets to Wimbledon, seven operas and two catwalk shows. Jonathan Stephens, the permanent secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport since 2006, enjoyed the most diverse social life courtesy of his job. His efforts to maintain contacts with his department's stakeholders took him to concerts, the theatre, balls, the Proms, Wimbledon and Chelsea football club. After Hartnett, Mike Mitchell, director general for rail networks at the Department for Transport, declared the most events \u2013 89 over the three years. Among the 3,000 entries are dozens with media organisations, including six with the Guardian. The Cabinet Office said: \"All departments have clear rules regarding hospitality as set out in the civil service code. We are committed to transparency by publishing quarterly the hospitality of senior civil servants.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
