Mark Carney had earlier cancelled a scheduled speech on the financial services sector to a dinner of City bankers in London after the news of Cox\u2019s death. Instead of his planned speech, the Bank\u2019s governor expressed his condolences and hailed the Labour politician\u2019s political and charity sector work. \u201cOn behalf of everyone at the Bank of England, I would like to express our horror at today\u2019s events in West Yorkshire,\u201d Carney said. \u201cOur thoughts, condolences and prayers are with Jo Cox\u2019s husband, her two young children, her extended family and her colleagues. \u201cWhile I did not know Jo Cox personally, I knew many of you did and that many, many more knew what a remarkable person she was. Jo Cox dedicated her life to helping others,\u201d he added, citing her work with Oxfam, the NSPCC, the Freedom Fund, international action to stop deaths in childbirth and her more recent role representing constituents in Batley and Spen. Canadian-born Carney also praised the British parliamentary system. \u201cThis country is renowned the world over for the dedication, the innovation and the principles of its public servants,\u201d Carney told the annual Mansion House dinner, where he had been scheduled to speak alongside chancellor George Osborne. \u201cI have always admired their ability to confront difficult issues, to engage in spirited public debate and then to strive for a better future. \u201cI have no doubt that this spirit will remain undimmed and such progress will continue. The best tribute that this room, this city and the country can give to the memory of Jo Cox is to renew our shared commitment whatever our differences to promote the common good in the United Kingdom and the world.\u201d Carney has been criticised by leave campaigners for what they see as inappropriately political comments from the independent central bank in recent weeks. He warned in May that a Brexit outcome in next week\u2019s EU referendum could tip the UK into recession. Earlier on Thursday, Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont, Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith wrote a Telegraph article accusing the Treasury and the Bank of England of a \u201cwoeful failure\u201d to offer a fair analysis of what might happen in the event of Brexit. But David Cameron defended the Bank, saying the leave campaign\u2019s criticism of the independent Bank was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Separately, it emerged that Bernard Jenkin MP, a director of the Vote Leave campaign, had written to Carney warning him not to breach the pre-referendum \u201cpurdah\u201d rules by talking about the referendum. But Carney hit back, telling Jenkin that the Bank had simply been following its statutory duty to the UK people, according to the BBC, which saw the letters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
