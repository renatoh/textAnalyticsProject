The demise of Johnson has left Theresa May the firm favourite in a contest with the less experienced \u2013 but more firmly Eurosceptic and rightwing \u2013 Andrea Leadsom, a position May entrenched by winning the backing of a majority of her Westminster colleagues last week. But could the membership deliver an upset? They have form. In 2001 Iain Duncan Smith was considered the rank outsider in a contest with the more electorally appealing and vastly more experienced Ken Clarke, yet he won handily with the membership. One important factor then was Europe \u2013 Clarke\u2019s Europhile views were too far out of line with the grassroots. Europe, of course, is a dominant issue once again, and Theresa May\u2019s Remain vote means that she, like Clarke, holds views out of line with the Tory grassroots. Other factors may play in Leadsom\u2019s favour. The current weakness of the Labour party may encourage Tory members to gamble on a more radical leader. Leadsom has a vocal and active support base and is receiving strong backing from Leave.EU donor Aaron Banks. A small and volatile selectorate could be open to a well-organised and resourced pitch from the outsider. In a time when politics keeps delivering surprises, another win for an energising outsider seems a very plausible scenario. The case looks less strong when we dig a little deeper. While our knowledge of the Conservative membership is limited (we don\u2019t even know for sure how many members the party has), it is much better than it used to be, thanks to surveys conducted by YouGov in collaboration with the Party Members Project\u201d headed by professors Tim Bale and Paul Webb. They are a very grey, middle-class group. Their average age is nearly 60, and more than 80% are from white-collar ABC1 social grades. Politically engaged, they lean very heavily towards broadsheet papers for their news \u2013 a majority name the Times or the Telegraph as their newspapers of choice, while only a fifth read the Daily Mail and hardly any report reading the Sun regularly. The membership is Eurosceptic, but not overwhelmingly so, like the broader Conservative electorate. About two-thirds report voting to leave the EU last month. The Conservative grassroots are rightwing on economic issues, but not overwhelmingly so, and socially conservative on issues such as crime, immigration and respect for authority \u2013 but much less so than Ukip voters. Members rate competence and party unity as the most important factors in choosing a leader; just 30% consider it essential that the leader be a Leave backer. Much of this looks likely to help Theresa May. She\u2019s the establishment candidate, pitching to an \u201cestablishment\u201d electorate that is dominated by older, middle-class, pragmatic rightwing broadsheet readers. The populist sentiment Leadsom is looking to harness is strongest among blue-collar workers and tabloid readers \u2013 very under-represented in the Tory selectorate. May\u2019s large advantage in the MPs\u2019 ballot and long experience should resonate with an electorate focused on competence and unity. MPs were much more evenly divided when Iain Duncan Smith delivered his upset.Nor can Leadsom make use of any surge in populist Euroscepticism following the referendum to offset May\u2019s advantages \u2013 members must be in place for three months to vote, so those attracted to the party during and after the campaign are excluded. May started second favourite to Johnson, and became a strong frontrunner when he dropped out. Polls show her winning among moderates and Remain voters, and splitting rightwingers and Leave voters evenly. Similar polls from YouGov called both David Cameron\u2019s and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s victories correctly. Conservative members have not participated in a contested leadership election for more than a decade, so nothing can be ruled out, but Leadsom has a lot of work to do if she wants to deliver yet another shock to the political system.
