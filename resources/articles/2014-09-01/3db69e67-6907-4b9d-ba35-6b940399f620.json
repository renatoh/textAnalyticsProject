At just over four hours, At Berkeley almost ceases to function as a documentary in the normal sense and becomes something nearer to an archive resource, or an audio-visual database. Its star is the university\u2019s chancellor, Robert Birgeneau, a Canadian-born physicist with white-blond hair and a flashing smile, whose placid, diplomatic manner makes him the perfect academic administrator and neutraliser of student activists, for whom he appears to have a polite disregard. There are a lot of talking heads \u2013 and a lot of talking. If the film has a theme, it is middle-class angst. The students debate the new bourgeois financial anxiety and white suburban poverty. It is their own problem. Does the new middle-class anxiety manifest itself in the film? It\u2019s not clear. There are some tense discussions about whether or not students are doing enough to include black people in informal study groups. But these discussions would have been as tense, maybe more tense, during the good times. Certainly Berkeley does not seem to be in a 90s-style uproar over political correctness. The once controversial \u201cWestern Civ\u201d course isn\u2019t even mentioned. As with Wiseman\u2019s previous film about the Crazy Horse nightclub in Paris, At Berkeley does look offputtingly like a promotional video for the host institution, but everything here is so unworldly and high-minded that the emphasis on ideas is refreshing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
