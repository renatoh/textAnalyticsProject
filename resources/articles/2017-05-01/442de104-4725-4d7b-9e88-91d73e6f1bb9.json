By noon \u2013 this being New Orleans \u2013 a tour group on bicycles stopped to gawk at the empty spot where his likeness had stood. \u201cGone,\u201d the tour leader said. With Davis\u2019s removal, New Orleans is halfway through its effort to remove four Confederate monuments around the city. Authorities approached its removal like they did the first: at 3am a crew wearing masks and bulletproof gear, heavily guarded by police, took the statue in two pieces, which were secreted away to an undisclosed warehouse. Protests in response have been muted, and largely driven by objectors from out of state. By Thursday afternoon protesters on both sides had dispersed, for the moment giving way to hurrying university students and tourists. Police did arrest one person overnight; that was Jason Sutton, a 46-year-old fabrication engineer. He introduced himself Thursday afternoon by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a white supremacist. I\u2019m local.\u201d He described himself as \u201cpro-statue\u201d and a cultural preservationist. In the early hours of the morning, he said, he was taking photos of the monument and wandered into a group of anti-statue protestors. One of them pushed him, he said, \u201cSo I slugged him.\u201d Police charged him with disturbing the peace, he said, \u201cBut I\u2019d do it again. The city is losing valuable history here. They\u2019re erasing it.\u201d The push to remove the monuments started almost two years ago, after white supremacist Dylann Roof shot nine black members of Mother Emmanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina. In the days after the shooting, photos emerged of Roof posing with Confederate battle flags, resulting in a nationwide debate about Confederate symbols on public land. In December 2015, the New Orleans city council voted remove the local statues from public display; they will eventually be housed in a museum or somewhere similar, according to the mayor\u2019s office. That decision has withstood legal challenges from various groups in favor of keeping them in place. Mayor Mitch Landrieu issued a statement on Thursday, saying: \u201cThese monuments have stood not as historic or educational markers of our legacy of slavery and segregation, but in celebration of it. I believe we must remember all of our history, but we need not revere it. To literally put the Confederacy on a pedestal in some of our most prominent public places is not only an inaccurate reflection of our past, it is an affront to our present, and a bad prescription for our future.\u201d Sutton said he believes Landrieu is only using the monuments and the spectacle of their removal as a play for higher office outside the city. \u201cHe\u2019s pleasing people far away from here,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue here. Not a single African American person I\u2019ve talked with has said they feel oppressed or bothered by the statues. If they did, I\u2019d say, \u2018Fine, let\u2019s take them down.\u2019\u201d That reasoning doesn\u2019t stand up to widespread local support for the removals, including by the next person who walked past Sutton on the sidewalk. \u201cWe all grew up knowing what those statues stood for. Badness, in a word,\u201d said 57-year-old Nathan Albert, who is black. He said he didn\u2019t mind Sutton\u2019s particular objections \u2013 being local matters here \u2013 but others anger him. \u201cWhat\u2019s really upsetting is the people from other states coming down here and getting mad,\u201d he said. \u201cIf y\u2019all want them that much, you can take them back to your own state.\u201d The battle over the statues will likely intensify before it ends. The first of the four statues to come down \u2013 a monument to the Battle of Liberty Place, and last night Confederate president Jefferson Davis \u2013 were the least contentious of the four. The remaining statues of Gens PGT Beauregard and Robert E Lee evoke a more romantic, ennobled view of the civil war, and may draw a more impassioned response. The location of the fight will also shift, and increase the risk of violence. City officials so far have tackled each monument by order of increasing size. On Wednesday a civil district court ruled that the city does have the right to remove the Beauregard monument, denying a request from opponents to put a hold on any action. The Beauregard statue is large \u2013 the bronze general and his horse, on a tall pedestal \u2013 but not as large or complex as the Lee monument, making it the likely next target. But it, like Jefferson Davis, stands in the largely white Mid City neighborhood. The Lee statue, though, looms 100ft over downtown, and presents a host of complications: logistical, racial, emotional and otherwise. As one woman recently shouted at defenders of the Beauregard statue: \u201cYou all aren\u2019t brave enough to do this at Lee Circle. Too many black people. You\u2019ll get your asses kicked.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
