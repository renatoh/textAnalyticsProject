All hope is lost", "bodyText": "\u2022 Not the best of months, perhaps, for the Scottish yes lobby, with the UK parties vowing not to share the pound and the EU president suggesting it might not let an independent Scotland join \u2014 all topped off, most painfully of all, with the loss of David Bowie. So hurrah for the curling, the (Scottish) sport in which five (Scottish) women on Thursday claimed bronze in Sochi, and five (Scottish) men compete on Friday for gold. Were the country to sever from the union, indeed, the sport could provide a flagship industry for the new independent economy, with 70% of the world's curling stones manufactured by one small Kilmarnock company, Kays of Scotland (got that?). The Sochi stones were made at Kays, quarried, like the rest, from the tiny Ayrshire island in the Firth of Clyde, Ailsa Craig, whose dense microgranite is commonly agreed to make the finest stones in the world. The small workshop produces about five \u00a3400 stones a day, says the factory's manager Bill Hunter, but production might have been down a bit this week as they have all, understandably, been gripped by the unfolding events on BBC Sport. So was the women's medal a victory for Team GB or for Scotland? \"As a personal view, albeit they are all Scots, it's a British victory,\" says Hunter. Oh dear. Why? \"Independence will never happen. I just can't see the Scottish people, when it comes to it, voting for it.\" So Kay's of Scotland is not \u2026 \"Very independently minded. No.\" Oh, Alex Salmond. The beating heart of curling is unionist. All hope is lost. \u2022 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA, former director of the CIA and big, big fan of the Guardian, has been doing a tour of Oxford, where he will this year serve as the Humanitas visiting professor in intelligence studies. In one lecture at Pembroke College, the former spook-in-chief revealed how it had been his responsibility in 1999 to install extra security on Barack Obama's BlackBerry so it couldn't be hacked by foreign states. Was it just possible, knowing this, that the US had overreached itself by hacking the phone of the German chancellor, a student asked the following day. \"We probably didn't get much knowledge about al-Qaida from Angela Merkel's BlackBerry,\" said Hayden, adding, \"I'm not confirming or denying we did or didn't do it, and I think honest men can judge whether it was a good idea if we did do it.\" Wasn't it obvious that it was a terrible idea? \"I have political guidance. I was waved off targets because of their sensitivity. If we did this, maybe I should have been waved off that.\" That'll be a yes, then. \u2022 Happy news from Wisconsin, whose governor, the Associated Press reports, is poised to sign into law a bill that will (at last!) legalise rubber duck racing. The game, a sort of neon Poohsticks in which thousands of numbered yellow plastic ducks are released into rivers to race downstream, is a popular local fundraising activity, but for years has officially been banned in the midwest state as \"illegal gambling\". The new bill will mean that illicit duck meets like the Sheboygan Falls Ducktona 500, sponsored by Blattner's Piggly Wiggly, can at last come out from the shadows. We'll have a tenner on number 12,834. \u2022 Reader Liz Semeonoff gets in touch about our item earlier in the week about The Bread Shop, a small bakery on Aigburth Road in Liverpool, that flogs its wares under the slogan \"Crap sweets and rude staff\". \"It's a fabulous shop which sells a huge range and the staff are great,\" she says. \"The shop owner always has a smile and a hello for customers.\" We try once again to call and this time reach Alan Gordon, whose grandfather Len and father Frank have been running the shop since 1958, now joined by next door sweet shop (The Sweet Shop) and cafe (The Cafe). Turns out he's not rude at all. \"We've always had pretty good banter with the customers,\" he says. \"Not like Tesco where they don't look at you\". You can also buy T-shirts and mugs reading \"Terrible service and lousy food\", while the shop's carrier bags carry the slogan \"I've just supported a family business\" along with a picture of Gordon's three-year-old daughter Ava and the words, \"I'll be the boss one day.\" Lovely.
