Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, has offered \u00a3250,000 for the best idea for a garden city. Shelter argues that large-scale developments akin to Milton Keynes are needed if Britain is to build the number of homes it needs. Toby Lloyd, Shelter's head of policy, says the development corporation building a new town must have the power to buy land at its current market value. \"Milton Keynes is one of the economic powerhouses of the country. The case for a new generation of new towns is very strong,\" he says. 2 Build more social housing When housebuilding was at its postwar peak in the late 1960s, the private and public sectors built about 200,000 homes a year each. Last year the number of affordable homes built in the social rented sector was just 24,550, down more than a third on the previous year. Green party London assembly member Darren Johnson argues that new blocks of privately-built \"luxury apartments\" in London do nothing to solve the city's housing shortage because they are bought by investors \u2013 often on sites where social housing has been demolished. Low-paid Londoners are left with the same problem of expensive private-sector rents. 3 Change government incentives Housebuilders credit the chancellor's Help to Buy programme with reviving the construction of new homes but critics argue it encourages price rises because it stokes demand for existing homes while doing little to increase the supply of housing. Shelter has called for government guarantees on investment in new houses, which will attract long-term investors looking for steady rental income. Allowing local authorities to borrow against their housing revenues could also boost their ability to build more homes, says Shelter. 4 Relax the planning rules The government was forced to backtrack on plans to allow more building on green belt land after an outcry by the rural lobby. Supporters of relaxation argue that only about 10% of Britain is built on and that there is plenty of unattractive land that can be used for building new homes. Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Council to Protect Rural England, says that for people near proposed sites to accept new building they have to be convinced their schools and other services will not be overloaded. Housebuilders also need to improve on the standardised \"rabbit hutches\" they currently put up. \"There are rational reasons to assume new houses will make an area worse. The housing industry needs to raise its game,\" he says. 5 Face up to wider problems in the economy Professor Karel Williams of Manchester university says politicians are hemmed in by the belief that more houses in London and the south-east will solve the problem. Building more houses funded by bank credit will only push prices up because banks will lend to people bidding up prices, he says. \"Teachers, firemen and modestly-paid salesmen will never be able to buy a house in London and that is to do with credit rather than the supply of housing,\" he adds. As well as arguing for more social housing that does not rely on credit, Williams says the UK needs more investment in places where houses already exist but prices are not rising, such as Liverpool, the north-east and parts of Wales. Doing so would use existing infrastructure and revive those places instead of piling more strain and cost on transport, water supply and other infrastructure around London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
