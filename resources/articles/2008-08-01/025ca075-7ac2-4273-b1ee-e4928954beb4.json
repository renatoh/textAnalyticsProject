The three pieces pianist Fabrizio Ottaviucci includes here date from the same period as those classics - the two Keyboard Studies from 1964, Tread on the Trail from the following year. All of them allow the performer considerable freedom - the studies build from repetitions of simple melodic cycles of varying lengths, which the performer can combine as he or she thinks appropriate, while Tread on the Trail can be performed by any number of musicians who are given five melodic lines that they can repeat and overlap in a number of canon-like ways. There's a jazzy feel to the basic riffs - a reminder that Riley is a huge admirer of John Coltrane - while some of the metrical complexities that the layerings produce recall Nancarrow's player-piano pieces, especially as Ottaviucci uses multi-tracking to combine the sounds of several pianos. The result is fascinating, while his rhythmically strict performance of the studies gives them a compulsive intensity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
