Despite initial fears that Scholes may require his third operation on a recurrent hernia problem, the injury appears to have healed itself during the month since his last game. He has trained all week and, if everything goes according to plan, he should be in the squad when United travel to Germany and, even if it is considered too great a risk to include him in the starting line-up, he should be in contention for a full 90 minutes against Birmingham City at Old Trafford on Saturday week. Sven-Goran Eriksson will be acutely aware, however, that he still has a relative minefield to negotiate in persuading United to release Scholes for the Euro 2004 qualifier in Istanbul the following weekend and that his occasionally fractious relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson might be put to the test again. Even if Scholes is back playing, Ferguson will be loath for him to risk aggravating the problem while on international duty, particularly as the United manager blames England's friendly against Croatia for leaving Scholes unable to play in the first place. Ferguson says the club will have to \"adopt a softly softly approach\" to minimise the risk of the 27-year-old suffering a relapse. Eriksson will have the power, if necessary, to insist that Scholes is inspected by England's medical staff but that would be only a last resort. Ferguson has confirmed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be out of the game for three months as he recovers from knee surgery. The Norwegian striker has been struggling with the problem since pre-season and it was decided to follow the pattern of last term and send him for an operation quickly to ensure he will return for the second half of the campaign. Ferguson admitted it was a blow to lose the 30-year-old, who has done an impressive job on the right-hand side of midfield following the departure of David Beckham to Real Madrid. Leeds and Manchester United have slashed away ticket allocations for games between the two clubs this season in an attempt to prevent serious crowd trouble. Leeds will give United only 1,300 tickets for the first encounter in Yorkshire on October 18 - with Peter Reid's side getting 1,900 for the Old Trafford return on February 21."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
