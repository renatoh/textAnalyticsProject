Kaori Tatebayashi, ceramicist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/aug/21/features.magazine17", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2005/aug/21/features.magazine17", "fields": {"headline": "Introducing ...", "bodyText": "For me, working with ceramics is like breathing - I grew up understanding the character of clay.' What might sound insufferable in another artist is a lot more palatable when Kaori Tatebayashi explains that she was raised in the tiny Japanese village of Arita, internationally famed for its Imari ware. 'I spent my childhood watching my relatives make ceramics.' Thirty-year-old Kaori makes melancholic sculptures of everyday items - a discarded camisole, a forgotten shoe. These pieces have already captured the imagination of those who matter: she recently exhibited her work at Ceramic Art London, only for the Stephanie Hoppen gallery to snap her up for its forthcoming Textures exhibition. A big leap for the teenager who spent her holidays making tableware. 'I wanted to express something more with ceramics. I 'm trying create work that triggers each person 's individual memories - after all, once the clay has been fired, time is trapped in the piece, so nostalgia is natural.' With work of this quality, who are we to argue? \u00b7 Kaori's life-size works will be at the Stephanie Hoppen Fine Art Gallery, 17 Walton Street, London SW3, from 11 October - 5 November (www.stephaniehoppen.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
