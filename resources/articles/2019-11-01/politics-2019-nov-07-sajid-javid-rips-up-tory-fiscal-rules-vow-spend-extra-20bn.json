The chancellor was repeatedly challenged over his decision to increase borrowing at the same time as criticising Labour for wanting to do the same. He claimed the parties\u2019 approaches were \u201clike night and day\u201d, with the Tories having \u201cgood reasons\u201d to borrow to invest in infrastructure while Labour could not be trusted to manage the economy. Javid said his two main new fiscal rules were that the Conservatives would run a balanced current account budget by the middle of the next parliament and that borrowing for infrastructure would not exceed 3% of GDP. Under a third rule, the framework would be reassessed if future borrowing costs rose significantly to above average. He hinted the Conservatives still believed there would be room for tax cuts to be promised in the party\u2019s election manifesto and suggested there would be enough money to commit to the Northern Powerhouse rail project in full. Javid said now was a responsible time to increase borrowing because interest rates were negative for the government and it was a moment for \u201cnew rules for a new economic era\u201d. Speaking from an aircraft hangar outside Manchester, he said: \u201cOur first rule will be to have a balanced current budget. What we spend cannot exceed what we bring in.\u201d Javid said the exception would be borrowing to build, as he promised new hospitals, schools, roads, railways and better broadband. \u201cInvestment in long-term projects like roads and rail will not exceed 3% of GDP,\u201d he said. \u201cNow compared to a long-term average of around 1.8%.\u201d The rule breaks the previous framework imposed by the Conservatives in 2017, which set a 2% rule. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility were expected to show a breach of the target this week, but the publication of the report was blocked by the civil service because of election purdah rules. The Liberal Democrats said the decision \u201csmacks of political interference\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
